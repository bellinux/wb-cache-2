40|$|A {{procedure}} for obtaining {{an indicator of}} trends in illicit intravenous (I. V.) drug use-a form of drug use which is very harmful and difficult to measure-has been developed using national hepatitis surveillance data. Hepatitis reports are separated into two groups: one containing mostly cases related to transmission via I. V. drug use and the other containing cases related to transmission via personal contact and blood transfusion. The analysis of ten years of national hepatitis reporting (1966 to 1975) shows an almost ten-fold rise in <b>drug-related</b> <b>hepatitis</b> cases from 1966 to 1972. In {{the last three years}} the number of cases has declined but remains substantially greater than the pre-epidemic levels. The rise in I. V. drug-related cases began in the 1960 's among minority groups living in the center cities of the East and West Coasts and spread during the 1970 's into the suburbs of these cities and into metropolitan areas throughout the United States. Limitations of this indicator of I. V. drug use relate to the characteristics of the surveillance system and to the underlying relationship of hepatitis to I. V. drug use...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis C infections {{occurring}} {{in recent years}} in the European Union may cost countries billions of euros in future healthcare, according to research published in this monograph. A conglomeration of state-of-the-art research on hepatitis C, drug use and public health methods, this publication presents analyses on the impact and costs of the disease among injecting drug users, as a basis for sound policy-making. Other issues addressed include: quality of life; treatment, surveillance and prevention; and the cost-effectiveness of measures such as needle-exchange programmes and substitution therapy. Hepatitis C affects an estimated 170 million people worldwide and at least a million, but possibly several million, people in Western Europe who are at risk of developing liver cirrhosis or liver cancer. It is a highly infectious and potentially fatal blood-borne disease that attacks the liver and for which there is as yet no vaccine.

40|$|The {{value of}} {{standard}} y-globulin {{with a low}} titer of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HB,) vs hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) in prevention of icteric hepatitis B in the military is unclear. Although {{recent studies have shown}} a decrease in icteric hepatitis after administration of both types of y-globulin in populations where acquisition of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is most likely the result of nonparenteral transmission, the data pertaining to parenteral exposure suggest that HBIG delays the incubation period of HBV and decreases the development of passive-active immunity. Since no studies have demonstrated efficacy of standard y-globulin or HBIG in a drug-using population where multiple HBV exposures are likely, the results observed in most trials are not comparable to hepatitis B associated with drug abuse in the military. Therefore, before a recommendation for use of routine-y-globulin or HBIG can be made for <b>drug-related</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in the military, efficacy of standard-y-globulin and/or HBIG should be demonstrated in this population. Although there is little doubt concerning the efficacy of y-globulin in decreasing the incidence of icteric hepatitis A, the usefulness of standard 'y-globulin or hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) containing a high titer of antibody to hepatitis B surfac...|$|E
40|$|In 2008, Harm Reduction International {{released}} the Global State of Harm Reduction, {{a report that}} mapped responses to <b>drug-related</b> HIV and <b>hepatitis</b> C epidemics {{around the world for}} the first time. (1) The data gathered for the report provided a critical baseline against which progress could be measured in terms of the international, regional and national recognition of harm reduction in policy and practice. Since then, the biennial report has become a key publication for researchers, policymakers, civil society organisations and advocates, mapping harm reduction policy adoption and programme implementation globally. In the second and third editions, the Global State of Harm Reduction 2010 : Key Issues for Broadening the Response(2) and The Global State of Harm Reduction 2012 : Towards an Integrated Response,(3) important harm reduction issues were explored in a series of chapters on key topics, such as the response to amphetamine-related harms, harm reduction in prisons, effective harm reduction services for women who inject drugs, and access to harm reduction services by young people. The Global State of Harm Reduction 2014 continues to map the response to <b>drug-related</b> HIV, viral <b>hepatitis</b> and tuberculosis. It also integrates updated information on harm reduction services into each regional chapter, including on needle and syringe programmes (NSPs) and opioid substitution therapy (OST) provision; harm reduction services in the prison setting; access to antiretroviral therapy for people who inject drugs; regional overdose responses; policy developments; civil society developments; and information relating to funding for harm reduction...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Liver damage due to facultative hepatotoxins is {{scarcely}} foreseeable. We evaluated {{the prevalence of}} acute drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in a specific setting, assessing eventual interactions with pre-existing hepatic illnesses. Methods: The research {{was carried out in}} an Italian tertiary care hospital, by analyzing 248 patients with non-advanced liver disease, divided into two well-matched groups: 174 patients (median age 53, 94 females) with hepatitis C virus-related chronic hepatitis; and 74 (median age 55, 39 females) with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Results: Six patients (2. 4 % of the whole population) belonging to the NAFLD group (chi(2) -test, P = 0. 004) suffered from acute hepatoxicity related to the following drugs, that is antihypertensive, acting on platelet aggregation, antimicrobial, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and proton pump inhibitor. The NAFLD presence was an independent risk factor in determining <b>drug-related</b> acute <b>hepatitis,</b> with an odds ratio of 3. 95 (95 % confidence intervals: 11. 48 - 1. 35). Central obesity was relevant in every patient with acute toxicity. Alcohol consumption and drug association did not influence the acute drug-induced liver damage. Conclusion: NAFLD conveys a nearly fourfold increase of DILI risk in obese middle-aged patients. NAFLD, characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, could predispose to drug-induced hepatotoxicity that probably shares the same pathophysiological mechanism...|$|R
40|$|In 2008 Harm Reduction International {{released}} the Global State of Harm Reduction, {{a report that}} mapped responses to <b>drug-related</b> HIV and <b>hepatitis</b> C epidemics {{around the world for}} the first time. The report has since been published every two years. The Global State of Harm Reduction 2012 presents the major developments in harm reduction policy adoption and programme implementation that have occurred since 2010, enabling some assessment of global progress. It also explores several key issues for developing an integrated harm reduction response, such as building effective harm reduction services for women who inject drugs, access to harm reduction services by young people, drug use among {{men who have sex with}} men, global progress toward drug decriminalisation and sustainability of services in challenging environments. This report, and other global state of harm reduction resources, are designed to provide reference tools for a wide range of audiences, such as international donor organisations, multilateral and bilateral agencies, civil society and non-governmental organisations, including organisations of people who use drugs, as well as researchers and the media...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Medical tourism for {{aesthetic}} {{surgery is}} popular. Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) occasionally cause surgical-site infections. As NTM grow in biofilms, implantations of foreign bodies are at risk. Due to late manifestation, infections occur when patients are back home, where {{they must be}} managed properly. Case Report. A 39 -year-old healthy female was referred for acute infection of the right gluteal area. Five months before, she had breast implants replacement, abdominal liposuction, and gluteal lipofilling in Mexico. Three months postoperatively, implants were removed for NTM-infection in Switzerland. Adequate antibiotic treatment was stopped after seven days for <b>drug-related</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> At entrance, gluteal puncture for bacterial analysis was performed. MRI showed large subcutaneous collection. Debridement under general anaesthesia was followed by open wound management. Total antibiotic treatment was 20 weeks. Methods. Bacterial analysis of periprosthetic and gluteal liquids included Gram-stain plus acid-fast stain, and aerobic, anaerobic and mycobacterial cultures. [*][*]Results. In periprosthetic fluid, Mycobacterium abscessus, Propionibacterium, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were identified. The same M. abscessus strain was found gluteally. The gluteal wound healed within six weeks. At ten months' follow-up, gluteal asymmetry persists for deep scarring. Conclusion. This case presents major complications of multisite aesthetic surgery. Surgical-site infections in context of medical tourism need appropriate bacteriological investigations, considering potential NTM-infections...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{a case of}} recurrent acute hepatitis related {{to the use of}} cetirizine, a selective histamine(1) -receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of common allergic diseases. CASE SUMMARY: A 26 -year-old man was hospitalized with a week-long history of weakness, nausea, anorexia, and hyperchromic urine, which had developed after 6 days of therapy with oral cetirizine 10 mg/day for allergic rhinitis. Admission laboratory testing revealed evidence of acute hepatitis and seropositivity for liver-kidney microsome antibodies. Liver biopsy findings of diffuse portal tract and lobular inflammation with a prominent eosinophilic infiltrate were consistent with <b>drug-related</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> The patient was discharged after one week of treatment with tocopherol and glutathione. Three months after discharge, transaminase levels were normal. At 6 months, seropositivity for liver-kidney microsome antibodies was still present, but considerably less intense. The patient had suffered 2 previous episodes of "acute hepatitis of unknown origin," and both had occurred after cetirizine use. DISCUSSION: Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated cetirizine as the probable cause of acute hepatitis, and the positivity for liver-kidney microsome antibodies is suggestive of an autoimmune mechanism for liver damage. As of September 13, 2004, ours is the fourth reported case of acute hepatitis associated with cetirizine and the second in which liver-kidney microsome antibodies have been documented. CONCLUSIONS: Although cetirizine is considered to have low potential for severe hepatic toxicity, the possibility that it can provoke autoimmune-mediated hepatotoxicity should be considered...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} {{a review of}} the data available in Ireland on <b>drug-related</b> infectious diseases (<b>hepatitis</b> B, C and HIV). These diseases continue to be an issue of major concern in relation to Irish injecting drug users. The section on determinants of drug-related infectious diseases in the Irish context presents an overview of research that has looked at the risk behaviours engaged in by Irish drug users, both in relation to their injecting drug use and their sexual behaviour. It also explores the data available on both the health-related consequences and the wider social consequences of drug-related infectious diseases. An outline of the harm-reduction services available to Irish injecting drug users, which aim {{to prevent the spread of}} drug-related infectious diseases among this population, is given. Services that provide care for those already infected are also described. The authors identify a number of gaps in the information available in this field including, the absence of comprehensive routine data collection on the diseases and a lack of research on the societal and familial consequences of the diseases...|$|R
40|$|HIV/AIDS {{remains one}} of the country’s most serious health challenges. According to an {{overwhelming}} body of evidence, needle and syringe exchange programs not only reduce the spread of HIV, but also save money, encourage the safe disposal of syringes, minimize the risk of needlestick injuries to law enforcement officials, and help link chemically dependent individuals to vital drug treatment services. In difficult budgetary times, investments in syringe exchange are a wise use of tax dollars. Injection <b>drug-related</b> HIV and <b>hepatitis</b> C infections remain serious health crises in the United States Each year, 50, 000 Americans are newly infected with HIV. 1 Injection drug use remains a driving force in the national epidemic, accounting for 14 percent of new HIV infections among women and 7 - 11 percent of new HIV infections among men in the United States in 2010. 2 Reaching the federal goal of an “AIDS-Free Generation” 3 requires effective, sustained efforts to prevent new infections among injection drug users (IDUs). Approximately 3. 2 million Americans are living with hepatitis C (HCV), and deaths related to HCV have increased substantially over the last decade. 4 The evidence is clear: Syringe services programs prevent HIV transmission Sharing contaminated injecting equipment {{is one of the most}} efficient means of HIV transmission. 5 Scores of studies have conclusively demonstrated that SSPs help prevent infection by reducing the re-use and circulation of injecting equipment without increasing drug use or resulting in other negativ...|$|R
