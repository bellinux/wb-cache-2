40|$|Background: High-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> is the {{government}} program to supply electricity needs. However, in practice, obstacles {{have been identified in}} the form of rejection from the community due to the outstanding issues that high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> have an impact on health. Aim: This research aims to analysis the magnitude of electromagnetic wave radiation of high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> construction on health. Methods: The study was conducted by measuring electromagnetic wave radiation prior to high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> (150 kV) construction and predicting the amount of radiation generated after this operation and its impact on health. Result: The field measurement result showed that the highest strength of magnetic field in the absence of construction and operation activity of high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> 150 kV was 0. 00085 mT and the highest electric field was 0. 004241251 V/m. The results of the magnetic field strength analysis showed that the highest strength of magnetic field and electric field when the high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> is completed and operated was magnetic field of 0. 00415 mT and electric field of 38. 4 V/m. The value was far lower than the standard limits recommended by IRPA / INIRC, WHO 1990 and SNI 04 - 6950 - 2003. The allowed electric field strength is 5 kV / m and the allowed magnetic field strength is 0. 1 mT. Conclusion: Electromagnetic wave radiation of High-Voltage <b>Air</b> <b>Ducts</b> is not exceeded the allowed limit, so it will not cause a direct risk to health. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{underground}} <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> along peripheral {{walls of}} a building are a remediation method, which principle is to enable an air flow along the moist building structure’s surface to allow a sufficient evaporation of moisture from the structure. This measure reduces the water transport (rising moisture) into the higher parts of the wall where the high water content in masonry is undesirable. Presently, underground <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> are designed as masonry structures, which durability in contact with ground moisture is limited. The article describes a new design of an underground <b>air</b> <b>duct,</b> {{which is based on}} specially shaped concrete blocks (without wet processes, because the blocks are completely precast). The <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> from concrete blocks is situated completely below the ground surface (exterior) or below the floor (interior).

40|$|The use of {{ventilated}} facades and roofs {{can help}} to reduce summer thermal loads and, therefore, the energy consumption due to air-conditioning systems. This paper discusses a simple analytical method for the calculation of the energy saving achievable by using ventilated facades in which the air flow inside the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> is due to stack effect. Two particular cases of outstanding importance are investigated. The first in which the inner masonry wall is given, and the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> and the outer facing have to be optimized.

Finally, {{the influence of the}} variation of some quantities necessary for calculation on the energy performance of ventilated facades is investigated.

In the numerical analysis, the acoustic characteristics of the freezer cavity were solved, and the mixed finite element method was then implemented to analyse the coupled behaviour of the cavity with the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> using the Acoustic Fluid-Structure Interaction (AFSI) technique.

40|$|The thermal {{performance}} of a low-cost, hoop-type swine building (3. 55 × 5. 7 × 10. 3 m) was evaluated under the winter weather conditions of Central Japan. The hoop building had two curved roofs made from 2. 5 cm diameter tubular steel pipes each covered with a reflective film. There was a 20 cm air space between {{the inner and outer}} covers through which the exhaust air flowed. A positive-pressure ventilation fan and an <b>air</b> distribution <b>duct</b> were used to supply the <b>fresh</b> <b>air.</b> The evaluation was conducted for three opening configurations of the <b>air</b> distribution <b>duct</b> (one, two, or four holes on a cross-section of the duct) and presence or absence of an internal curtain. Furthermore, the effect of replacing the reflective film with a PVC film for the east side cover on solar transmission and thus the internal temperature rise was quantified. The building was simulated to house 30 pigs at a body weight of 70 kg. Resistive heating wire was used to simulate the sensible heat generation of the pigs at 131. 5 W/pig at 10 °C temperature. The inside temperature averaged 6. 9 °C higher than the outside temperature during the minimum ventilation period. As the exhaust air passed through the double-layer air space, 25. 4 % of exhaust heat transferred back into the building and 74. 6 % lost to the outside. When replacing the reflective covers with the PVC film covers on the east side, the internal temperature rise increased to an average of 7. 6 °C with a maximum of 12. 7 °C. The magnitude of temperature rise was proportional to the transmitted solar radiation, as evidenced by the higher temperature rise during the day and significantly reduced temperature rise at night. To eliminate the effects of cold, nocturnal radiation, the PVC film cover should be covered by the regular reflective cover at night.

40|$|In {{conventional}} air-conditioning system, <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> {{volume is}} always restricted to save energy, which sacrifices {{indoor air quality}} (IAQ) to some extent. However, removing the latent load of air by liquid desiccant rather than by cooling is an alternative way of reducing energy consumption. Therefore, IAQ can be improved by increasing the volume of <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> introduced into an air-conditioning system. In this paper, a liquid desiccant based air-conditioning system is studied, with the system performance under various <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratios analyzed using simulation tests. In addition, the proposed system and a conventional system are compared. In the proposed system, {{with the increase in}} <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratio, the heating load for solution regeneration rises, the dehumidification efficiency increases and the regeneration efficiency drops. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the liquid desiccant based system decreases sharply when the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratio exceeds 60 %.

The maximum power saving ratio is 58. 9 % when the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratio is 20 %; however, the ratio drops when the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratio increases.
