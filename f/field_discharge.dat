In the two-electrode system under reduced pressure, the breakdown voltage characterizes a minimum energy input of the electric field to initiate and sustain the glow discharge. The glow discharge enhanced by the magnetic field applied just above {{the surface of the}} cathode influences the breakdown voltage decreasing its value. The idea of the experiment was to verify whether the contribution of potential energy of the magnetic field applied around the cathode is sufficiently effective to locate the plasma of glow discharge to the grounded cathode, which, in fact, is the part of a vacuum chamber wall (the anode is positively biased in this case). In our studies, we used the grounded magnetron unit with positively biased anode in order to achieve favorable conditions for the deposition of thin films on fibrous substrates such as fabrics for metallization, assuming that locally applied magnetic field can effectively locate plasma.

The responses across on- and off-zones were plotted for 321 cells with a stationary optimum oriented light slit. The cells fell into two completely distinct subgroups {{with respect to}} the degree of overlap between adjacent on- and off-zones. The simple cells had a mean overlap of 16. 8 %, the complex cells 94. 5 %. For simple cells the ratio between the maximum off- and maximum on-response in the <b>discharge</b> <b>field</b> was bimodal, showing that two distinct subgroups termed on- and off-dominant cells could be distinguished. For the complex cells the corresponding frequency distribution was unimodal. The maximum response on the two regions adjacent to the most responsive discharge zone (the dominant zone) differed markedly for most simple cells, and only a very few cells had <b>discharge</b> <b>fields</b> approximating an ideal even symmetric field. The frequency distribution of the ratio between the maximum response in the two regions was unimodal showing that odd and even symmetric fields did not form distinct subgroups of simple cells. The number of different discharge zones in simple cells varied from one to five. The zones were arranged as alternating on- and off-zones across the <b>discharge</b> <b>field.</b> The maximum response in the subzones decreased with increasing sequential distance from the dominant zone, so the response pattern across each side of the <b>discharge</b> <b>field</b> resembled a damped wave-form pattern.

With {{the development of the}} lip pressure method, however (James 1962), an accurate method was derived which could measure the flow when a geothermal well discharges to the atmosphere at sonic velocity. Fortunately most discharges from wells do in fact attain such velocities, {{and as long as the}} enthalpy of the mixture is known, the flow can be determined. Where the enthalpy is unknown some other measurement has also to be made in order to solve the two factors of flow and enthalpy. By discharging the whole mixture into a silencer, the water portion can be estimated by means of a weir, and this provides the second measurement (described in James 1966) required to solve both unknowns. With the hoped-for commercial success of the total energy turbine in the near future, it will be necessary to have a means of measuring the steam-water flow into the machine. As long as the enthalpy of the flowing fluid is known, there should be no intrinsic difficulty in obtaining this, as the nozzles themselves act as metering devices due to the phenomena of sonic velocity at the throat. High gas concentrations in the steam phase, together with high chemical content in the water phase, require the use of “corrections” which will have to be determined from field tests to confirm theory. Clean steam-water mixtures appear to present no difficulties. 7 refs...|$|R

Two to 24 weeks later, area 17 (striate cortex; V 1) was studied electrophysiologically in a standard anaesthetized, paralysed (artificially respired) preparation. Recording single- or multineurone activity revealed extensive topographical reorganization within the lesion projection zone (LPZ). Thus, with stimulation of the lesioned eye, about 75 % of single neurones in the LPZ had ‘ectopic’ visual <b>discharge</b> <b>fields</b> which were displaced to normal retina {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the lesion.

Indeed, the consequences from fluctuations in ionized propellant density, temperature, and potential may include increased thrust, exacerbated engine erosion, and spacecraft interference. In this work, the unsteady nature of a Hall effect thruster discharge is investigated via two-dimensional, time-resolved plasma measurements. A novel dual Langmuir probe diagnostic is developed to enable an unprecedented temporal resolution for electrostatically acquired plasma properties near the upper theoretical limits of this probe. Observations of large amplitude transient oscillations caused by the Hall thruster breathing mode are seen for all thruster conditions at all spatial locations and in all measured plasma properties including: discharge current, electron density, electron temperature, and plasma potential. A unique method of spatiotemporal data fusion facilitates visualization of two-dimensional time-resolved planar plasma density contour maps is also developed where discrete turbulent bursts of plasma are tracked as the thruster exhales breaths of ionized propellant at velocities in excess of 12 km/s. This time-resolved investigation of the plasma downstream from a Hall thruster unveils an environment rich in oscillatory behavior dominated by the Hall thruster breathing mode. These insights {{emphasize the importance of}} time-resolved plasma measurements and, through enhanced understanding of the discharge process, may ultimately lead to improved thruster designs that work in concert with plasma fluctuations to achieve enhanced performance...|$|E

Hydrological modeling of large river catchments has become a challenging task for water resources engineers due to the complexity of collecting and handling both spatial and nonspatial data, such as rainfall, gauge-discharge data, and topographic and hydraulic parameters. The Gash is a transboundary river which originates from the Eritrean Highlands and Ethiopian Plateau, and ends up in Sudan. It is unique in its discharge flows with torrential rain between Jul. and Oct., while being dry for the rest of the year. Despite this characteristic, the river is the main source of water for domestic and agricultural use in Kassala City, Sudan. In this chapter, we briefly present the potential application of satellite-based rainfall estimates, and develop a flood forecasting model for the Gash River Basin, Sudan, through a distributed modeling approach using remote sensing data. The approach includes rainfall-runoff modeling, hydrodynamic flow routing, and calibration and validation of the model with <b>field</b> <b>discharge</b> data. The study area is divided into 25 subbasins to improve model accuracy. To generate relevant parameters for modeling, GlobCover land cover data (1000 m), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) at 90 m, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) soil grid data using freely available datasets were used for the Gash River in Eastern Sudan. Based on several studies in Eastern Africa on the choice of satellite-based rainfall estimates, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) was used to represent the actual rainfall pattern and intensity of the basin. Model simulations were carried out using the HEC-HMS model. From 6 years (2007 – 12) of available discharge data for five stations, the period 2008 – 11 was considered for calibration with 2008 as the warming-up period, and data from 2007 and 2012 were used for validation.

The model used is PCR-GLOBWB-MOD, which is a physically based and fully coupled groundwater-land surface model operating at a daily basis and having a resolution of 30 arc sec (about 1 km at the equator). As a test bed, we use the combined Rhine-Meuse basin (total area: about 200, 000 km 2), where there are 4250 point-scale observed groundwater head time series that are used to verify the model results. Calibration is performed by simulating 3045 model runs with varying parameter values affecting groundwater head dynamics. The simulation results of all runs are evaluated against the remotely sensed soil moisture time series of SWI (Soil Water Index) and <b>field</b> <b>discharge</b> data. The former is derived from European Remote Sensing scatterometers and provides estimates of the first meter profile soil moisture content at 30 arc min resolution (50 km at the equator). From the evaluation of these runs, we then introduce a stepwise calibration approach that considers stream discharge first, then soil moisture, and finally verify the resulting simulation to groundwater head observations. Our results indicate that the remotely sensed soil moisture data can be used for the calibration of upper soil hydraulic conductivities determining simulated groundwater recharge of the model. However, discharge data should be included to obtain full calibration of the coupled model, specifically to constrain aquifer transmissivities and runoff-infiltration partitioning processes. The stepwise approach introduced in this study, using both discharge and soil moisture data, can calibrate both discharge and soil moisture, as well as predicting groundwater head dynamics with acceptable accuracy. As our approach to parameterize and calibrate the model uses globally available data sets only, it opens up the possibility to set up large-extent coupled groundwater-land surface models in other basins or even globally.

Laboratory analysis was also carried out on all samples using spectro-photometric techniques for pH, turbidity, phosphate and nitrates. The response of Leary's Brook basin to the November 13 - 14 storm was dominated by the non-urbanized portions of the basin; although the urban high fast response in water, solute and suspended sediment yield rates produced a considerable short term effect on the outlet. The overall response of the basin was an aggregate of the urban and non-urban components. Although the outlet solute and sediment yield rates were considerably larger than those of the forested area, the outlet yield rates were not as high as many other urbanized areas. Parking lot runoff demonstrated that not all urban land use causes runoff deterioration. Planning and management may ameliorate urban runoff effects. This study demonstrated a variation in outlet response to non-uniform flood generation controlled by land use rather than precipitation distribution.

Temperature and conductivity of hand collected samples were determined in the <b>field.</b> <b>Discharge</b> was measured by stage and later calculated by the Manning equation or by rating with current meter measurements. Laboratory analysis was also carried out on all samples using spectro-photometric techniques for pH, turbidity, phosphate and nitrates. The response of Leary's Brook basin to the November 13 - 14 storm was dominated by the non-urbanized portions of the basin; although the urban high fast response in water, solute and suspended sediment yield rates produced a considerable short term effect on the outlet. The overall response of the basin was an aggregate of the urban and non-urban components. Although the outlet solute and sediment yield rates were considerably larger than those of the forested area, the outlet yield rates were not as high as many other urbanized areas. Parking lot runoff demonstrated that not all urban land use causes runoff deterioration. Planning and management may ameliorate urban runoff effects. This study demonstrated a variation in outlet response to non-uniform flood generation controlled by land use rather than precipitation distribution. Hourly rotational sampling proved useful for single storm sampling of five sites, but more frequent sampling of urban runoff would be an improvement. Dry weather sampling of 35 sites in the basin showed the choice of the representative sub-catchments to be reliable...|$|E

40|$|Presumptive marine Vibrio spp. were {{collected}} from an operational oil field and control site located in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. Of 440 isolates analyzed {{for the presence of}} extrachromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid elements or plasmids by using the cleared lysate and agarose gel techniques, 31 % showed distinct plasmid bands on agarose gels. A majority of the plasmids detected were estimated to have molecular masses of 10 × 106 or less. Multiple plasmids were observed in approximately half of the plasmid-containing strains. A number of isolates contained plasmids with similar banding and mobility patterns. The oil field area had noticeably more plasmid-containing strains (35 versus 23 % in the control site) and a greater number of plasmids per plasmid-containing strain (an average of 2. 5 plasmids, versus 1. 5 in the control site). Oil <b>field</b> <b>discharges</b> might have resulted in increased plasmid incidence and diversity...|$|R
