40|$|To {{solve the}} problem of solar abandoning, which is {{accompanied}} by the rapid development of photovoltaic (PV) power generation, a demonstration of a photovoltaic-battery energy storage system (PV-BESS) power plant has been constructed in Qinghai province in China. However, it is difficult for the PV-BESS power plant to survive and develop with the current <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> mechanism and subsidy policy. In this paper, a three-part <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> mechanism is proposed based on a deep analysis of the construction and operation costs and economic income. The on-grid <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> is divided into three parts: the capacity <b>price,</b> graded <b>electricity</b> <b>price,</b> and ancillary service price. First, to ensure that the investment of the PV-BESS power plant would achieve the industry benchmark income, the capacity <b>price</b> and benchmark <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> are calculated using the discounted cash flow method. Then, the graded <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> is calculated according to the grade of the quality of grid-connected power. Finally, the ancillary service price is calculated based on the graded <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> and ancillary service compensation. The case studies verify the validity of the three-part <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> mechanism. The verification shows that the three-part <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> mechanism can help PV-BESS power plants to obtain good economic returns, which can promote the development of PV-BESS power plants...|$|R
30|$|The {{proposition}} {{includes the}} result where the equilibrium peak-time retail <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> becomes {{lower than the}} default price. Why should such a result occur? Larger α implies the wholesale electricity supply function is relatively flat. Remember that the retail <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> depends on two factors, wholesale <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> as a cost component and marginal retail service cost. While the wholesale <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> becomes almost constant because of its flat supply function, marginal retail service cost diminished significantly after the system reform. The default retail <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> could become higher for the remaining retail service cost. This is why the peak-time price becomes lower than the default price.|$|R
5|$|Some {{photovoltaic}} systems, such as rooftop installations, {{can supply}} power directly to an electricity user. In these cases, the installation can be competitive when the output cost matches the price {{at which the}} user pays for his electricity consumption. This situation is sometimes called 'retail grid parity', 'socket parity' or 'dynamic grid parity'. Research carried out by UN-Energy in 2012 suggests areas of sunny countries with high <b>electricity</b> <b>prices,</b> such as Italy, Spain and Australia, and areas using diesel generators, have reached retail grid parity.|$|E
5|$|The Cruachan station {{temporarily}} stores {{energy at}} times of low demand, and releases it {{at times of}} high demand, when <b>electricity</b> <b>prices</b> are higher, reducing the maximum power that must be provided by power stations.

Despite the use of some rainwater, Cruachan is not a net generator of electricity: it uses more energy for pumping water and spinning its turbines than it generates.|$|E
5|$|The first {{places to}} reach grid parity were {{those with high}} {{traditional}} <b>electricity</b> <b>prices</b> {{and high levels of}} solar radiation. Currently, more capacity is being installed in the rooftop than in the utility-scale segment. However, the worldwide distribution of solar parks is expected to change as different regions achieve grid parity. This transition also includes a shift from rooftop towards utility-scale plants, since the focus of new PV deployment has changed from Europe towards the Sunbelt markets where ground-mounted PV systems are favored.|$|E
30|$|Fitting {{the data}} in Table  3 shows that the average {{residential}} <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> in U.S. increases linearly with the year generally. Thus {{it is possible to}} make an approximate prediction of the future <b>price</b> of residential <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> in the U.S. The trend of residential <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> in China is still unpredictable after the completion of the power market reform. However, in the long run, since <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> mainly depends on energy price, the rising trend of residential <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> in China is inevitable after a gradual replacement of coal-fired power with non-fossil fuels. This paper assumes that the future trend of China’s residential <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> {{on the basis of the}} current (about 0.6 yuan/kWh) is similar to that of the U.S., to make a forecast for China.

5|$|In {{cases of}} self {{consumption}} of the solar energy, the payback time {{is calculated based on}} how much electricity is not purchased from the grid. For example, in Germany, with <b>electricity</b> <b>prices</b> of 0.25 €/kWh and insolation of 900 kWh/kW, one kWp will save €225 per year, and with an installation cost of 1700 €/KWp the system cost will be returned in less than seven years. However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and {{some or all of the}} energy is fed back into the grid. The electricity is sold, and at other times when energy is taken from the grid, electricity is bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics. In many markets, the price paid for sold PV electricity is significantly lower than the price of bought electricity, which incentivizes self consumption. Moreover, separate self consumption incentives have been used in e.g. Germany and Italy. Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid feed-in in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity. By increasing self consumption, the grid feed-in can be limited without curtailment, which wastes electricity.|$|E

40|$|Accurate <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> {{forecasting}} {{plays an}} important role in the profits of electricity market participants and the healthy development of electricity market. However, the <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> time series hold the characteristics of volatility and randomness, which make it quite hard to forecast <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> accurately. In this paper, a novel hybrid model for <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> forecasting was proposed combining Beveridge-Nelson decomposition (BND) method, fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA), and least square support vector machine (LSSVM) model, namely BND-FOA-LSSVM model. Firstly, the original <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> time series were decomposed into deterministic term, periodic term, and stochastic term by using BND model. Then, these three decomposed terms were forecasted by employing LSSVM model, respectively. Meanwhile, to improve the forecasting performance, a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm FOA was used to automatically determine the optimal parameters of LSSVM model for deterministic term forecasting, periodic term forecasting, and stochastic term forecasting. Finally, the forecasting result of <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> can be obtained by multiplying the forecasting values of these three terms. The results show the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the proposed BND-FOA-LSSVM model are respectively 3. 48 %, 11. 18 Yuan/MWh and 9. 95 Yuan/MWh, which are much smaller than that of LSSVM, BND-LSSVM, FOA-LSSVM, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) -FOA-LSSVM models. The proposed BND-FOA-LSSVM model is effective and practical for <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> forecasting, which can improve the <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> forecasting accuracy...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, coal {{price has}} risen rapidly, which has also brought a sharp {{increase}} in the expenditures of thermal power plants in China.

40|$|Daily <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> {{forecasting}} {{plays an}} essential role in electrical power system operation and planning. The accuracy of forecasting <b>electricity</b> <b>price</b> can ensure that consumers minimize their electricity costs and make producers maximize their profits and avoid volatility.
