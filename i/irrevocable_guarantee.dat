5000|$|At {{the end of}} September 2010 the 2008 {{guarantee}} {{covering the}} six bailed out banks expired. [...] Prior to the lapsing of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) Scheme 2009 (the [...] "ELG Scheme") came into effect on 9 December 2009. The ELG Scheme provides for an unconditional and <b>irrevocable</b> State <b>guarantee</b> for certain eligible liabilities (including deposits over the €100,000 limit of the Deposit Guarantee Scheme) of {{up to five years}} in maturity incurred by participating institutions from the date they joined the scheme until the closure of the Scheme on certain terms and conditions.

500|$|Most Gulf {{downstream}} {{operations in}} Europe {{were sold to}} the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation in early 1983. The associated Gulf filling stations were converted to trade under the Q8 brand by 1988. However, attempts to sell Gulf Oil (Great Britain) to KPC failed because of <b>irrevocable</b> GOC <b>guarantees</b> given earlier in regard to bonds issued to finance the construction of refinery facilities in the UK. GO(GB) {{was taken over by}} Chevron and its stations continued to use the Gulf brand name and insignia until 1997 when the network was sold to Shell, although by this stage a fairly large proportion of Gulf stations were supplied by jobbers rather than Gulf Oil (GB). Gulf completely withdrew from the UK in 1997. This represented {{the end of the last}} major [...] "downstream" [...] use of the Gulf brand by Chevron.|$|R
50|$|The Isle of Man bank depositors' {{insurance}} scheme {{was introduced in}} 1991, to cover 75 percent of the first £15,000 per depositor per bank, {{but it was the}} October 2008 crisis-stricken Icelandic government's seizure of Kaupthing Bank hf in Iceland after the United Kingdom suspended the trading licence of Kaupthing's British subsidiary that compelled a radical revision of deposit insurance in the Isle of Man. Unable to secure reserves held by Kaupthing hf in Iceland or Kaupthing's British subsidiary to facilitate customer withdrawals, Kaupthing Singer and Friedlander (Isle of Man) Ltd. saw its Isle of Man banking licence suspended after operating less than a year, compelling the firm to request to be wound up. The Isle of Man government called an emergency session of the Tynwald parliament which voted unanimously to bring the Isle of Man depositors' compensation scheme into line with the newly enlarged scheme in the United Kingdom, guaranteeing with immediate effect 100 percent of the first £50,000 per depositor per bank, and studying amendments for the subsequent inclusion within the scheme of corporate and charitable accounts. The Isle of Man government also pressed the Icelandic government to honour Kaupthing hf's <b>irrevocable</b> and binding <b>guarantee</b> of all depositors' funds held by Kaupthing, Singer and Friedlander (Isle of Man) Ltd.|$|R
