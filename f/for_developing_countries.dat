5|$|Agriculture is the {{economic}} foundation of most countries, and <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> a likely source of economic growth. Growth in agriculture can benefit the rural poor, {{though it does}} not always do so. Profits from crops can increase from higher value crops, better marketing, value-adding activities such as processing, or expanded access {{for the public to}} markets.Profits can also decrease through reduced demand or increased production. Crop diversity can protect againstcrop failure, and can also offer higher returns.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{diagnostics}} {{are used}} to identify infectious diseases such as chlamydia, influenza virus and tuberculosis; or specific strains such as H1N1 virus. Genetic identification can be swift; for example a loop-mediated isothermal amplification test diagnoses the malaria parasite and is rugged enough <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> But despite these advances in genome analysis, in 2013 infections are still more often identified by other meanstheir proteome, bacteriophage, or chromatographic profile. Molecular diagnostics are also used to understand the specific strain of the pathogenfor example by detecting which drug resistance genes it possessesand hence which therapies to avoid.|$|E

As a result, it was determined that that there is a bidirectional relationship between energy consumption and economic improvement <b>for</b> <b>developed</b> <b>countries.</b> This condition provides two different results. Firstly, energy consumption has an influence on economic development for these countries. While considering this result, it can be said that any limitation in energy consumption will restrict economic growth. Moreover, it was also concluded that level of economic growth is the main reason of energy consumption <b>for</b> <b>developed</b> <b>countries.</b> In other words, <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> tend to have more energy consumption when their economies are growing...|$|R

25|$|Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) have {{investigated}} the potential impacts climate change could have on agriculture, and how this would affect attempts at alleviating poverty in the developing world.

Lastly, she found that identifying areas for further reform requires country-specific diagnostic assessment: broad areas <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> identified internationally (e.g. IMF) include, for example property taxation for local revenues, strengthening expenditure management, and effective taxation of extractive industries and multinationals.|$|E
