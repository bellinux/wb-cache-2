40|$|Electroluminescence is a {{developing}} {{area of research}} in the fields of display technology and lighting. Solution based processing of organic materials offers the opportunity to manufacture large area, low cost illuminating surfaces but current processes are limited to two dimensions. The ability to apply electroluminescent materials onto three dimensional contoured surfaces would incorporate the illuminating function into objects, enhancing usability and removing the need for an additional light source. Furthermore, the integration directly into the manufacturing process, such as injection moulding, would have the added benefits of reducing manufacturing time, handling and have environmental and economic savings. Incorporating electronics manufacturing in-mould offers considerable potential for novel research and commercial applications. Electroluminescent multi-layer structures were constructed on 3 D surfaces, applying materials using an airbrush. Novel injection moulded electroluminescent devices were successfully made using <b>insert</b> <b>moulding</b> and in-mould layer application techniques, then characterised and compared to a bought device. Electroluminescent layers were also applied to injection moulded plastic parts as a post mould treatment for further comparison. In the current state of development, <b>insert</b> <b>moulding</b> using a PTFE carrier film is the most successful method of injection moulding EL parts, producing devices that light up with an average illuminance of 210. 2  39. 2 lx when operated at 300 V and 400 Hz.

Special care has been taken for controlling both the reactivity at theTi/Al- 7 Si interface and the metallurgical health of the Al- 7 Si matrix. Mechanical tests until complete debonding have been completed with interrupted tests, metallographic characterizations and FEM analysis of elastic stress state. A mean shear strength of the interface of about 120 MPa has been obtained. When the Ti insert is solely fretted in the matrix, without chemical interaction between Ti and the Al- 7 Si alloy, the mean shear strength is significantly lower (48 MPa). This result clearly shows that chemical interaction at the interface (formation of a thin TiSi layer at the Ti side and a thick Al 3 Ti(Si) layer at the Al- 7 Si alloy side) improves the mechanical {{properties of}} the assembly.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The Substrateless Packaging process was developed at Loughborough University as an alternative method of manufacturing electronics with an improved end-of-life materials recovery profile. The process involves injection moulding to overmould electronic components in thermoplastic polymers. Initial prototype samples manufactured in previous work exhibited undesirable small gaps around the embedded components after solidification and which {{were thought to be}} the result of adhesion problems between the thermoplastic overmould and components. The study reported here had the aims of determining quantitatively what factors affect adhesion, and to identify which thermoplastic polymers are most suitable for the process. Following a literature survey, six engineering thermoplastics, PC, PBT, PS, ABS, PA 6 and PMMA were chosen for study as overmoulding materials, and tin as the solid adherend. The literature survey also identified the mechanisms contributing to adhesion at the metal-thermoplastic interface in <b>insert</b> <b>moulding</b> as material properties, interfacial forces between the materials, wetting at the interface, temperature of the insert (consequently temperature at the interface) and <b>insert</b> <b>moulding</b> parameters. A methodology was designed to allow investigation of all these factors, with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) force-distance measurements being used to measure room temperature interfacial forces, high temperature contact angle for wetting, and pull-out strength tests on overmoulded tin-coated wire for overall system adhesion. Excellent repeatability was seen in the measurements obtained with all three experimental methods. Moldflow finite element simulations of the <b>insert</b> <b>moulding</b> process were also undertaken. For the AFM measurements tin particles were adhered to the probe with the aid of a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) apparatus. PA and PMMA interatomic interactions with tin were found to be noticeably stronger than the other polymers. From consideration of the different possible contributions to the measured forces, it was concluded that the trend of interatomic interactions obtained is due to a combination of electrostatic forces, capillary forces and dispersion forces acting between the materials tested. In the high temperature contact angle measurements it was observed that the contact angles for all the materials producing drops in equilibrium reduce monotonically with rise in temperature at the interface. The work of adhesion was calculated from the contact angles for PMMA using the Young-Dupre equation and values of surface tension from the literature. It was found that it does not increase monotonically with temperature as might be expected from the contact angles. The works of adhesion at 240 °C for all the materials were also calculated and it was found that the materials ranking for expected adhesive strength changed significantly from that expected from consideration of contact angle alone. In the pull out tests, except for PC, the breaking loads for the materials tested rise then fall with rise in temperature of the insert. It was observed that peak breaking load for the amorphous polymers ABS, PS and PMMA occurred for insert temperature just below Tg of the polymer, and for semi-crystalline polymers PA 6 and PBT it was just above Tg. The ranking of materials by maximum pull out strength was found to be consistent with the ranking by mechanical strength (tensile strength at yield) of the thermoplastics. The Moldflow simulations yielded the significant results that the thermoplastic melt comes in contact with the insert at relatively low pressure (less than 0. 6 MPa), and that the temperature of the melt near the insert drops to the temperature of the insert almost instantaneously on contact. Therefore it was concluded that the efficacy of holding pressure on assisting wetting of the insert by the thermoplastic melt may depend on the temperature of the insert interface. The results in terms of material rankings from both the material level tests (AFM force distance experiment and wetting at high temperature) did not correspond to the mechanical strength test results. It was therefore concluded that the choice of material for thermoplastic overmould cannot be made purely based on the material interactions at interface between tin and thermoplastics in solid or melt phase. It was also concluded that the observed variation in the pull-out strengths with temperature of the insert maintained during overmoulding, must be largely due to the thermo-mechanical properties of the material at the interface. Based on the results of the study, PC, PBT and PMMA were recommended as being likely to give superior performance to the ABS which was used in early trials of the substrateless packaging process.

On the other hand, if there exists appropriate material for prototype production, physics of prototype production is different than of for e. g. injection moulding.

However, the production of those parts still causes difficulties due to challenges in the moulding and demoulding of plastics parts created with laser structured <b>mould</b> <b>inserts.</b> A complete <b>moulding</b> of the structures often leads to increased demoulding forces, which then cause a breaking of the structures and a clogging of the mould. An innovative approach is to combine PVD-coated (physical vapour deposition), laser structured inserts and a variothermal moulding process to create functional mic 8 iuro structures in a one-step process. Therefore, a PVD-coating is applied after the laser structuring process in order to improve the wear resistance and the anti-adhesive properties against the plastics melt.

Using the developed technologies, micro aspherical inserts of diameters ranging from 200 mu m to 1000 mu m with surface finish of around 10 nm and form error of similar to 0. 2 - 0. 4 mu m were successfully fabricated.

30|$|In all our {{cases the}} IUSs were <b>inserted</b> without <b>moulding</b> or cutting {{the arms of}} the device. There was no uterine {{perforation}} or expulsion of device. A single LNG-IUS has been inserted in one horn of a bicornuate uterus for menorrhagia [8]. There are no reports of two LNG-IUSs being used in the same patient. Their use in this fashion is an out-of-licence use. The patients were informed of this and consent obtained. The rate of release of one LNG-IUS is minimal at 20  μg in 24  h and therefore double the dose is unlikely to produce a significant systemic effect. Our high amenorrhoea rates {{may be due to the}} use of two devices.|$|R
40|$|Different {{from the}} {{traditional}} single or bifocal lens, freeform progressive addition lens (PAL) comprises of a far view zone, a near zone and a progressive zone between the far and near zones. Freeform PAL provides a good solution to correct presbyopia and other disorders of accommodation, which is more widely adopted in the present optometric applications. However, {{there is still a}} lack of a standard procedure for the design of a PAL. Besides, the traditional manufacturing of freeform PAL is usually done by the approaches of grinding and polishing one by one, which is not only expensive but also time-consuming. This paper presents the research of a new approach for design and manufacturing technology for freeform PAL by ultra-precision machining approach. Extended polynomial is employed for the representation of freeform surface, which is used for the optimization of optical performance by some commercial optical software such as Zemax. Ultra-precision machining technology based on single-point diamond turning with slow slide servo (3 S) machining is used to produce the <b>mould</b> <b>inserts</b> for precision <b>moulding</b> of the freeform PAL. Machining mechanics of 3 S is discussed. A freeform PAL with an aspherical surface as front side and a freeform surface as back side has been designed. The precision <b>mould</b> <b>insert</b> of the designed freeform PAL was produced by ultra-precision machining process, and a plastic freeform PAL made of polycarbonate was also produced by precision moulding. Preliminary results obtained show that the new approach for design and fabrication is helpful to advance the design procedure optimization and mass production of PAL in optometry.
