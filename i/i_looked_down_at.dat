60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the little}} factor, I {{could see that}} his face was flushed and that he bore every {{appearance}} of having had an extra glass.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him compassionately, {{for he was}} old {{and broken}} in spirit, and would plainly starve if turned adrift on the prairie, while as I did so the {{surveyor}} broke in: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{knew what}} that meant, and a cold shiver {{went up and down}} my backbone. But <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him--spick-and-span and glossy--his neckties are never crooked--and said, yes, he might come at three o'clock.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> {{stopped and}} <b>looked</b> up at her. She started back from {{me with a}} scream of terror. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> again <b>at</b> the title-page, and read the next lines-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Blacky {{pretended not}} to hear this. [...] "I've often thought," [...] said he, [...] "of you and Mrs. Reddy as <b>I</b> have <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> those fat hens. It is too bad that they are so far away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{brought into}} my head, master," [...] returns the woman, her eyes filling with tears, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the child lying so. If {{it was never}} to wake no more, you'd think me mad, I should take on so. I know that very well. I was with Jenny when she lost hers--warn't I, Jenny?--and I know how she grieved. But look around you at this place. Look at them," [...] glancing at the {{sleepers}} on the ground. [...] "Look at the boy you're waiting for, who's gone out to do me a good turn. Think of the children that your business lays with often and often, and that YOU see grow up!" ...|$|R
60|$|I got up {{then and}} {{approached}} her, {{with a strange}} sort of anxiety. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her round, strong neck, then stooped low enough to peep at her face. And I began to tremble a little myself.|$|E
60|$|Steel's jaw dropped, and his dismay {{would have}} been ludicrous had it not betrayed his whole-hearted friendship, while Thorn's burst of {{sulphurous}} language was an even more convincing testimony. Again I felt a curious humility, and something enlarged in my throat as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> them.|$|E
60|$|Quickly I fitted {{an arrow}} now that I might be ready {{at the next}} attack, and as I did so <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the girl, so that I {{surprised}} her in a surreptitious glance which she was stealing at me; but immediately, she again covered {{her face with her}} hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor little girl," [...] <b>I</b> exclaimed, <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the slim, graceful figure by my side. [...] "This is no {{atmosphere}} {{for you to}} live in. Why will you not let me rescue you from it? Why won't you allow me to go straight and ask the general for your hand? At the worst he could only refuse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It gets {{me going}} when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> the aisle <b>at</b> {{the altar and}} see the arches and so on. And the priests in their robes--they look so--so way up--oh, I dunno just how to say it--so kind of uplifted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A citizen anarchist from Barcelona?" [...] <b>I</b> repeated, stupidly, <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the man. He {{had turned}} to {{his work in the}} engine-well of the launch and {{presented}} his bowed back to us. In that attitude I heard him protest, very audibly: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next moment}} she was in my arms, weeping convulsively on my {{shoulder}} while I clasped her close. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the brown glory of her hair, glinting gems in the sunshine far more precious to me {{than those in the}} treasure-chests of kings. And I bent my head and kissed her hair softly, so softly that she did not know.|$|E
60|$|Every time <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the chain}} on my {{waistcoat}} {{it reminded me}} of Sam. I looked on to the river and thought of 'im going down on the ebb. Then I got a sort o' lonesome feeling standing {{on the end of the}} jetty all alone, and I went back to the Bear's Head and 'ad another pint.|$|E
60|$|Thus I dreamed as {{we moved}} on toward Thuria. My dreaming was rudely {{shattered}} by a savage growl from Raja. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him. He had stopped in his tracks as one turned to stone. A thin ridge of stiff hair bristled along {{the entire length of}} his spine. His yellow green eyes were fastened upon the scrubby jungle at our right.|$|E
60|$|I {{was pleased}} to find that William's {{troubles}} were near an end without my having to interfere in his behalf, and I then remembered {{that he would not}} be able to see the girl Irene from the library windows, which are at the back of the club. <b>I</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her, but she refrained from signalling because she could not see William, and irritated by her stupidity I went out and asked her how her mother was.|$|R
60|$|As we {{went through}} the court I felt as though I had been tied to a string, {{suspended}} in the air, and spun. This was undoubtedly due to the heat. And after the astonishing conversation from which we had come, my admiration for the lady beside me was magnified to a veritable awe. We reached the archway. Madame la Vicomtesse held me lightly by the edge of my coat, and <b>I</b> stood <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|R
60|$|Now Larry {{was a large}} man, {{much larger}} {{altogether}} than myself, and as he said this <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> involuntarily <b>at</b> his feet; or rather at his foot, for as he stood I could only see one. And then a sudden hope filled my heart. On that foot there glittered a shoe--not indeed such as were my own which were now resting ingloriously at Ballyglass while they were so sorely needed at Castle Conor; but one which I could wear before ladies, without shame--and in my present frame of mind with infinite contentment.|$|R
6000|$|She {{tried to}} slip {{them out of}} sight, but I was too quick and, seizing one, held it fast, feeling ashamed and sorry as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> it. The hard ropes had torn the soft white skin, and {{the rim of the}} bucket or the coaming had left dark bruises. Admiration, mingled with pity, forced me to add: [...] "It was very cruel. I called you child. You are the bravest woman I ever met!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{nevertheless}} fancied she {{was pleased}} at my eagerness, and, for Haldane had passed on, I felt suddenly oppressed by the recognition of what I owed her. Yet had it been possible I should not have lightened the debt. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her gravely, noticing how young and fresh and slender she seemed--bright as the blaze of sunshine in which she stood--and then I pointed towards the long ranks of sheaves and the sea of stately ears.|$|E
60|$|And then {{it struck}} me {{suddenly}} that I was very anxious that she should believe me. It was not that I feared the results which would follow a general belief that I had returned from the Barsoomian heaven or hell, or whatever it was. Why was it, then! Why should I care what she thought? <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her; her beautiful face upturned, and her wonderful eyes opening up the very depth of her soul; and as my eyes met hers I knew why, and--I shuddered.|$|E
60|$|I {{wondered}} why. I did {{not know}} enough of her brother for the remotest guess at what he might be like. I had never set eyes on the man. I didn't know him so completely that by contrast I seemed to have known Miss de Barral--whom I had seen twice (altogether about sixty minutes) and with whom I had exchanged about sixty words--from the cradle so to speak. And perhaps, <b>I</b> thought, <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Mrs Fyne (<b>I</b> had remained standing) perhaps she thinks that this ought to be enough for a sagacious assent.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{thick of}} the crowd had already passed. 'Looky there, Ted,' quoth the younger of the detectives, with the {{sharpness}} of surprise in his voice, and pointed straight to my feet. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> and saw <b>at</b> once the dim suggestion of their outline sketched in splashes of mud. For a moment I was paralysed.|$|R
60|$|I MADE no {{movement}} {{to leave the}} room; I let no sign of sorrow escape me. At last, my heart was hardened against {{the woman who had}} so obstinately rejected me. <b>I</b> stood <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her with a merciless anger, the bare remembrance of which fills me at this day with a horror of myself. There is but one excuse for me. The shock of that last overthrow of the one hope that held me to life was more than my reason could endure. On that dreadful night (whatever I may have been at other times), I myself believe it, I was a maddened man.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his marsh-stained shoes. One {{foot was}} wet to the ankle, {{and a thin}} strip of green seaweed had wound itself around his trousers. To any other man I should have had more to say. Yet even in those first few hours of our {{acquaintance}} I had become, like all the others, to some extent the servant of his will, spoken or unspoken. So I held my peace and looked away into the fire. I felt {{he had something to}} say to me, and I waited.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked up}} at me without replying, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him without {{pressing}} him too soon with a repetition of my idle question. Just then there came a vague vibration in the earth and air, quickly changing into a violent pulsation, and an oncoming rush that caused me to start back, as though it had force to draw me down. When such vapour as rose to my height from this rapid train had passed me, and was skimming away over the landscape, I looked down again, and saw him refurling the flag he had shown while the train went by.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the grave}} with {{a pang of}} {{compassion}} for the unfortunate Wolf Tone Fitzgerald, with whom the blessed would not rest. I was even astonished, though I had worked expressly to this end. But the birds were astir, and the cocks crowing. My landlord was an early riser. I put the spade on the truck again, and hastened back to the farm, where I replaced them in the cow-house. Then I stole into the house, and took a clean pair of boots, an overcoat, and a silk hat. These with a change of linen, were sufficient to make my appearance respectable. I went out again, bathed in Four Mile Water, took {{a last look at}} the cemetery, and walked to Wicklow, whence I traveled by the first train to Dublin.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was under}} his hand, and I soothed {{him to let}} me move his hand away. The wound was a sword-thrust, {{received}} from twenty to twenty-four hours before, but no skill could have saved him {{if it had been}} looked to without delay. He was then dying fast. As I turned my eyes to the elder brother, <b>I</b> saw him <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> this handsome boy whose life was ebbing out, {{as if he were a}} wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all as if he were a fellow-creature.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a horrible}} {{place for a}} man to sit in," [...] she said, looking around her. [...] "You must take that wicker chair and throw away as many {{cushions}} as you like. Now I am going to fetch my uncle, and remember, please," [...] she concluded, looking back at him from the door, [...] "if I have seemed frivolous this morning, I am not always so. More than anything <b>I</b> am <b>looking</b> forward, <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Lyndwood, to have you, if you will, talk to me seriously." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 1973 {{interview}} with Music Star, guitarist Dave Hill recalled {{the making of}} the song's video after in relation to his fear of heights: [...] "We were making a special film for Top of the Pops at a power station. I was wearing a silver suit so they decided to film me walking along an overhead ledge as though I was a spaceman who'd just landed. It was very high up and <b>I</b> suddenly <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the ground. That was a mistake because I just froze. I had this terror of falling and I just froze completely, like a cat does when it gets stuck up a tree. You know, you watch that cat and you know it could get down the same way it came up - but the cat's too frightened, and it just sits there till somebody rescues it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her sweet {{spirit was}} about to leave its frail body, that was evident to me as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her, but she knew me and whispered, [...] "I'm glad to have you at home." [...] She showed no fear of death, in fact she {{appeared}} unconscious of her grave condition. She was a beautiful character and to see her lying there beneath her old-fashioned quilt, so small and helpless, so patient, lonely and sad, made speech difficult for me. She had meant much in my life. The serene dignity with which she and her mother had carried the best New England traditions into the rough front rank of the Border, was still written in the lines of her face. I had never seen her angry or bitter, and I had never heard her utter an unkind word.|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "Little Nassau" [...] {{was already}} filled and {{straining}} at the guys. The parachute lay flat {{along the ground}} and beyond it the trapeze. I tossed aside my overcoat, took my position, and gave the signal to let go. As you know, the first rush upward from the earth is very sudden, {{and this time the}} balloon, when it first caught the wind, heeled violently over and was longer than usual in righting. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the old familiar sight of the world rushing away from me. And there were the thousands of people, every face silently upturned. And the silence startled me, for, as crowds went, this was the time for them to catch their first breath and send up a roar of applause. But there was no hand-clapping, whistling, cheering--only silence. And instead, clear as a bell and distinct, without the slightest shake or quaver, came George's voice through the megaphone: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Seville from above. A Spanish town wears always {{its most}} picturesque {{appearance}} thus seen, {{but it is}} never different; the patios glaring with whitewash, the roofs of brown and yellow tiles, and the narrow streets, winding in unexpected directions, narrower than ever from such a height and dark with shade, so that they seem black rivulets gliding stealthily through the whiteness. Looking at a northern city from a tall church tower all things are confused with one another, the slate roofs join together till {{it is like a}} huge uneven sea of grey; but in Seville the atmosphere is so limpid, the colour so brilliant, that every house is clearly separated from its neighbour, and sometimes there appears to be between them a preternatural distinctness. Each stands independently of any other; you might suppose yourself in a strange city of the Arabian Nights where a great population lived in houses crowded together, but invisibly, so that each person fancied himself in isolation.|$|E
6000|$|I {{saw that}} we had {{reached the end of}} our rope. Below all was quiet--not a man remained. A door opened {{at the end of the}} narrow hull, and {{presently}} Nobs came trotting up to me. He licked my face and rolled over on his back, reaching for me with his big, awkward paws. Then other footsteps sounded, approaching me. I knew whose they were, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> straight <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the flooring. The girl was coming almost at a run--she was at my side immediately. [...] "Here!" [...] she cried. [...] "Quick!" [...] And she slipped something into my hand. It was a key--the key to my irons. At my side she also laid a pistol, and then she went on into the centrale. As she passed me, I saw that she carried another pistol for herself. It did not take me long to liberate myself, and then I was at her side. [...] "How can I thank you?" [...] I started; but she shut me up with a word.|$|R
5000|$|John Lee Hooker {{recorded}} the song as [...] "One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer" [...] in 1966. Hooker transformed Milburn's song [...] "into {{a vehicle for}} himself". He used the storyline and chorus (but altered the order), but [...] "edited the verse down to its essentials, filled in the gaps with narrative and dialogue, and set the whole thing to a rocking cross between South Side shuffle and signature boogie". [...] Part of Hooker's narrative included: And then I sit there, drinkin', gettin' high, mellow, knocked out, feelin' goodAbout that time <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> on the wall, at the old clock on the wallAbout {{that time it was}} ten-thirty then, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> the bar <b>at</b> the bartender, he said'What do you want, Johnny?', one bourbon, one scotch, and one beer ...|$|R
60|$|Perhaps I am exaggerating; but {{the truth}} is I find it {{extremely}} difficult to keep patience with Mrs Monnerie's pampered protégée. She was weak and stupid. Yet learning had not lost its charm. My mind persisted in being hungry, however much satiated were my senses and fine feelings. I even infected Susan with my enthusiasm for indigestible knowledge. For since Mrs Monnerie had begun to find my passion for shells, fossils, flints, butterflies, and stuffed animals a little wearisome, it was her niece who now accompanied me to my many Meccas in her stead. By a happy chance we often met on these pilgrimages the dark, straight-nosed young man whom <b>I</b> had <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> upon <b>at</b> my first ballet, and who also apparently was a fanatic.|$|R
