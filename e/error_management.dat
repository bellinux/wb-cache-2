Qualitatively speaking, with GCD we see a minimal model implementation of the information mismatch problem mentioned in the Introduction: The incongruous information provided to ring nodes by leader nodes leads to a decrease of performance with increasing centralized control. This aspect deserves a much more detailed analysis in future investigations, distinguishing between three types of information errors: (1) erroneous status perception, (2) time delay of status perception, and (3) true color errors (random color changes). With the distinction of leader nodes and ring nodes in mind, one can also distinguish between status information <b>errors</b> (<b>management</b> is not properly informed) and decision information <b>errors</b> (<b>management</b> does not inform properly).|$|R

Using qualitative methods, a multidisciplinary team gathered and analyzed data about the unintended consequences of CPOE, identifying nine types, and found that CDS-generated unintended consequences appeared among all types. Further analysis of 47 CDS examples uncovered three themes related to CDS content: elimination or shifting of human roles; difficulty in keeping content current; and inappropriate content. Three additional themes related to CDS presentation were found: rigidity of the system; alert fatigue; and potential for <b>errors.</b> <b>Management</b> of CDS must include careful selection and maintenance of content and prudent decision making about human computer interaction opportunities...|$|R

5000|$|A part {{failure mode}} {{is the way}} in which a {{component}} fails [...] "functionally" [...] on the component level. Often a part has only a few failure modes. Thus a relay may fail to open or close contacts on demand. The failure mechanism that caused this can be of many different kinds, and often multiple factors play a role at the same time. They include corrosion, welding of contacts due to an abnormal electric current, return spring fatigue failure, unintended command failure, dust accumulation and blockage of mechanism, etc. Seldom only one cause (hazard) can be identified that creates system failures. The real root causes can in theory in most cases be traced back to some kind of human error, e.g. design failure, operational <b>errors,</b> <b>management</b> failures, maintenance induced failures, specification failures, etc.|$|R

40|$|Very {{many things}} in our {{business}} and auditing environment are changing at an increasing rate. One central theme in auditing is how information technology developments affect {{the nature of the}} audit process and the audit skills. Auditors have to ask how to operate in new environments. New information technology support systems for monitoring and controlling operations could be useful. Artificial neural network (ANN) based information systems are proposed as one possible solution as a support tool for auditors. This article introduces the ANN technology and reviews the literature on auditing ANN applications. The review showed that the main application areas in auditing were material <b>errors,</b> <b>management</b> fraud, and support for going concern decision. ANNs have also been applied to internal control risk assessment, audit fee, and financial distress problems.

Digital system upset is a functional error mode that can occur in electromagnetically harsh environments, involves no component damage, can occur simultaneously in all channels of a redundant control computer, and is software dependent. A strategy is presented for dynamic upset detection {{to be used in}} the evaluation of critical digital controllers during the design and/or validation phases of development. Critical controllers must be able to be used in adverse environments that result from disturbances caused by an electromagnetic source such as lightning, high intensity radiated field (HIRF), and nuclear electromagnetic pulses (NEMP). The upset detection strategy presented provides dynamic monitoring of a given control computer for degraded functional integrity that can result from redundancy <b>management</b> <b>errors</b> and control command calculation error that could occur in an electromagnetically harsh operating environment.

40|$|Human {{errors in}} trauma {{resuscitation}} can have cascading effects leading to poor patient outcomes. To determine {{the nature of}} teamwork errors, we conducted an observational study in a trauma center over a two-year period. While eventually successful in treating the patients, trauma teams had problems tracking and integrating information in a longitudinal trajectory, which resulted in inefficiencies and near-miss errors. As an initial step in system design to support trauma teams, we proposed a model of teamwork and a novel classification of team errors. Four types of team errors emerged from our analysis: communication errors, vigilance errors, interpretation <b>errors,</b> and <b>management</b> <b>errors.</b> Based on these findings, we identified key information structures to support team cognition and decision making. We believe that displaying these information structures will support distributed cognition of trauma teams. Our findings have broader applicability to other collaborative and dynamic work settings that are prone to human error...|$|R

The {{first one}} consists in studying other data structures and functors {{commonly found in}} program development such as binary trees, for instance, and that have already shown their benefits in information search (e.g. complexity O(log(n) for search). The second perspective is an improvement of the programs presented {{in the paper that}} corresponds to a prototype and not an “industrial” tool. To proceed, three elements will be considered with: (1) <b>errors</b> <b>management</b> and all the code required to get a robust tool, (2) a command language to interact with the server and facilitate the database management (e.g. load/save), and (3) an access to the server through the web, i.e. anybody {{will be able to use}} it. The final perspective will be in the use of the optimizations proposed by the tools used for comparisons (e.g. indexation in Mysql) to get a better comparison of the performances. This perspective is complementary from the first one and must help to formalize, by the way of functors and natural transformations, the general principles already used by today technologies (and maybe proposes other improvements).|$|R
