50|$|<b>Krarup</b> <b>cable</b> is {{a method}} of loading lines to reduce their distortion. All methods of loading add series {{inductance}} to the cable to try to meet the Heaviside condition for no signal distortion. <b>Krarup</b> <b>cable</b> consists of iron wires wound tightly around the copper conducting cores {{and it is the}} iron that {{is the source of the}} additional inductance. However, it still does not have sufficient inductance to fully meet the Heaviside condition. Its construction also makes it expensive compared to the previously existing method of adding discrete loading coils at intervals along the cable. Against this, <b>Krarup</b> <b>cable</b> is lighter and easier to lay. The weight of early submarine cables using loading coils could cause excessive stress in the cable if not handled carefully. Additionally, <b>Krarup</b> <b>cable</b> has none of the problems of sealing the joins against seawater which was a major problem with loading coils before modern polymers began to be used.|$|E
5000|$|For these reasons, <b>Krarup</b> <b>cable</b> {{was popular}} on shorter distances, where the {{distortion}} {{was not so}} high that loading coils had to be used, until the advent of permalloy cable superseded it. [...] The first cable to be laid with <b>Krarup</b> <b>cable,</b> indeed the first cable to be laid {{with any kind of}} continuous loading, was between Helsingør (Denmark) and Helsingborg (Sweden) in 1902. This cable was engineered by Krarup himself.|$|E
