5|$|Most fish {{exchange}} gases using gills {{on either}} side of the pharynx. Gills consist of threadlike structures called filaments. Each filament contains a capillary network that provides a large surface area for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide. Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills. In some fish, capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing countercurrent exchange. The gills push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx. Some fish, like sharks and lampreys, possess multiple gill openings. However, bony fish have a single <b>gill</b> <b>opening</b> on each side. This opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an operculum.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike other seahorses, {{they have}} a single <b>gill</b> <b>opening</b> {{on the back of}} the head, instead of two on the sides.|$|E

5000|$|The {{spiracle}} is a {{small hole}} behind each eye that opens to the mouth in some fish. In the primitive jawless fish the first <b>gill</b> <b>opening</b> immediately behind the mouth is essentially similar to the other <b>gill</b> <b>opening.</b> With {{the evolution of the}} jaw in the early jawed vertebrates, this gill slit was [...] "caught" [...] between the forward gill-rod (now functioning as the jaw) and the next rod, the hyomandibular bone, supporting the jaw hinge and anchoring the jaw to the skull proper. The <b>gill</b> <b>opening</b> was closed off from below, the remaining opening was small and hole-like, and is termed a [...] "spiracle". The spiracle is still found in all cartilaginous fish except requiem sharks, hammerhead sharks, and chimaeras, and is found in some primitive bony fishes (coelacanth, sturgeon, paddlefish and bichirs). It is also seen as an otic notch in the skull of the extinct [...] labyrinthodonts, and is thought {{to be associated with the}} ear opening in amniotes and frogs.|$|E

50|$|The <b>gill</b> <b>openings</b> are {{probably}} numerous (more than 15) and minute. They opened between the diamond-shaped platelets which separate the dorsal from the ventral shield.|$|R
50|$|The leafy seadragon {{is related}} to the {{pipefish}} and belongs to the family Syngnathidae, along with the seahorse. It differs from the seahorse in appearance, form of locomotion, and its inability to coil or grasp things with its tail.A related species is the weedy seadragon, which is multicoloured and grows weed-like fins, but is smaller than the leafy seadragon. Another unique feature are the small, circular <b>gill</b> <b>openings</b> covering tufted <b>gills,</b> very unlike the crescent-shaped <b>gill</b> <b>openings</b> and ridged <b>gills</b> of most fish species.|$|R
50|$|Osteochilus waandersii has a {{well-defined}} black stripe along the sides, {{running from the}} <b>gill</b> <b>opening</b> {{to the end of}} the median caudal fin rays. It grows to 20.5 cm SL.|$|E
50|$|The fish {{grows to}} a maximum length of sixteen centimeters (in total length). It has small dark spots and can have pale stripes. Liparis tunicatus has a small <b>gill</b> <b>opening.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The genus name {{is derived}} from the Greek pylorus, meaning [...] "gatekeeper" [...] and branchos meaning [...] "gill" [...] in {{reference}} to a unique lappet-like structure in front of the <b>gill</b> <b>opening.</b>|$|E
50|$|G. andersonii is {{diagnosed}} by an interrupted post-labial groove, <b>gill</b> <b>openings</b> not extending to the underside, homodont dentition, strong and distally-flattened teeth in both jaws, slightly crescent-shaped tooth patch in upper jaw, and 10 - 11 branched pectoral fin rays. This fish species has a depressed head. The body is elongate, {{and it is}} flattened on the underside. The eyes are small and dorsally located. The teeth are flattened, strong, and blunt. The <b>gill</b> <b>openings</b> are narrow, not extending below the pectoral fin base. The paired fins are plaited to form an adhesive apparatus.|$|R
50|$|Frogfish have small, round <b>gill</b> <b>openings</b> {{behind their}} {{pectoral}} fins. With {{the exception of}} Butler's frogfish and the rough anglerfish, frogfish use a gas bladder to control their buoyancy.|$|R
50|$|Atlantic {{menhaden}} are silvery coloured fishes {{characterized by}} a moderately compressed body and a black spot on their shoulder behind their <b>gill</b> <b>openings.</b> They can reach a size of approximately 15 inches.|$|R
50|$|Parabrotula have between 37-41 dorsal {{soft rays}} and 34-38 anal soft rays. This species had a long, naked, {{compressed}} body with loose skin. Their skin is thin but not gelatinous. They {{also have a}} pointed snout with a large <b>gill</b> <b>opening</b> and their head and body is usually dark brown.|$|E
50|$|This species attains {{a length}} of up to 39 cm. It is unique among {{rattails}} in having 7 branchiostegal rays and a large <b>gill</b> <b>opening.</b> This is a generally very dark, sometimes black, fish with a very large head and small, widely spaced eyes. There is a small bioluminescent organ located between the pelvic fins.|$|E
50|$|Predominantly dark brown, {{the dwarf}} {{flathead}} gudgeon has paler brown or orange belly and reaches 5 cm in length, though more regularly is around 3.5 to 4 cm. It has dark brown lips. It {{can be distinguished}} from the flathead gudgeon, which is larger, has a wider <b>gill</b> <b>opening,</b> and has vertical stripes {{on the sides of}} the belly.|$|E
5000|$|The opening {{appears to}} have served both the {{olfaction}} and the intake of the respiratory water similar to the nasopharyngeal duct of hagfishes. Galeaspids are also the vertebrates which have {{the largest number of}} gills, as some species of the order Polybranchiaspidida (literally [...] "many gills shields") had up to 45 <b>gill</b> <b>openings.</b> The body is covered with minute scales arranged in oblique rows and there is no other fin besides the caudal fin. The mouth and <b>gill</b> <b>openings</b> are situated on the ventral side of the head, which is flat or flattened and suggests that they were bottom-dwellers.|$|R
50|$|Gills {{three and}} a half, a slit behind the last, equal to the {{diameter}} of the eye. The <b>gill</b> <b>openings</b> are small, not extending to the upper angle of the pectoral above, and closed below the preopercular angle beneath.|$|R
50|$|In open water, frogfishes {{can swim}} with strokes {{of the tail}} fin. They also {{have a kind of}} jet propulsion, often used by younger frogfish. It is {{achieved}} by rhythmically forcing their breath-water out through their <b>gill</b> <b>openings,</b> which lie behind their pelvic fins.|$|R
50|$|This species {{grows to}} around 40 cm in length. This {{is a very}} pale fish with darker fins and white jaws. The head, unlike in many deep-water species, has firm bones and the mouth is wide and {{terminal}} with bands of villiform (brushlike) teeth. A long, filamentous chin barbel and a wide <b>gill</b> <b>opening</b> are present.|$|E
50|$|As {{the name}} suggests, it {{is a large}} eel, {{reaching}} up to 3 m in length and 30 kg in weight. Its serpentine in shape body has a brownish background color. While juveniles are tan in color with large black spots, adults have black specks that grade into leopard-like spots behind the head and a black area surrounding the <b>gill</b> <b>opening.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rhinelepis {{species are}} large and heavily plated, though the plates on the abdomen (belly) develop later than in Pseudorinelepis. They are {{generally}} charcoal gray without any markings. The head is long and fat. The fins are short and the adipose fin is entirely absent. The <b>gill</b> <b>opening</b> is much larger than that of most loricariids. The cheeks lack elongate odontodes.|$|E
50|$|C. kishinouyei is {{diagnosed}} by an interrupted post-labial groove, <b>gill</b> <b>openings</b> not extending to the underside, homodont dentition, pointed teeth in both jaws, tooth patches in upper jaw joined into crescent-shaped band, and 12 - 14 branched pectoral fin rays. This fish species has a depressed {{head with a}} broadly rounded snout. The body is elongate, and it is flattened on the underside to the pelvic fins. The eyes are small, dorsally located, and subcutaneous (under the skin). The lips are thick, fleshy, and papillated, and a post-labial groove behind the lips is broadly interrupted at the middle. The <b>gill</b> <b>openings</b> are narrow, not extending below the pectoral fin base. The paired fins are plaited to form an adhesive apparatus.|$|R
50|$|P. hodgarti is {{diagnosed}} by having no post-labial groove (unlike {{other members of}} Glyptosternina), <b>gill</b> <b>openings</b> not extending to the underside, homodont dentition, pointed teeth in both jaws, tooth patches joined into a crescent-shaped band in upper jaw, and 13 - 16 branched pectoral fin rays. This fish species has a depressed head. The body is elongate, and it is depressed anteriorly. The skin is smooth dorsally but often tuberculate {{on the underside of}} the body. The lips are thick, fleshy, and papillated. The eyes are minute, dorsally located, and subcutaneous (under the skin). The <b>gill</b> <b>openings</b> are narrow, not extending below the pectoral fin base. The paired fins are plaited to form an adhesive apparatus. This species grows to a length of 6.5 cm TL.|$|R

50|$|Like {{most other}} anglerfishes, {{they have a}} very large head with a large mouth that bears long, sharp, {{recurved}} teeth. Also like other anglerfishes, the first spine of the spinous dorsal fin has been modified as an angling apparatus (illicium) that bears a bulb-like or fleshy lure (esca). The angling apparatus is located {{at the tip of the}} snout just above the mouth and is used to attract prey. Lophiid anglerfishes also have two or three other dorsal fin spines located more posteriorly on the head, and a separate spinous dorsal fin with one to three spines located more posteriorly on the body just in front of the soft dorsal fin. In the more primitive anglerfish genera (Sladenia and Lophiodes), the <b>gill</b> <b>opening</b> extends partially in front of the elongated pectoral fin base. In the derived lophiid genera (Lophiomus and Lophius), and all other anglerfishes, the <b>gill</b> <b>opening</b> does not extend in front of the pectoral fin base. The largest monkfish may exceed 1.5 m in length.|$|E
50|$|P. stoliczkana is silver-green with a {{vertically}} elongated black blotch {{behind the}} <b>gill</b> <b>opening,</b> and a vertically elongated black blotch on the caudal peduncle. The dorsal fin of a sexually active male is red {{with a black}} margin and two rows of black spots. It has no barbels and the last simple dorsal ray is serrated posteriorly. It grows to a maximum length of 5 cm SL.|$|E
50|$|The body {{of these}} Sardinella is {{particularly}} elongated {{even to the}} point of being sub-cylindrical. They have a slightly rounded belly and have eight rays on their pelvic fin. They have a very large number of gill rakers and a faint golden spot behind the <b>gill</b> <b>opening.</b> They also have a faint golden midlateral line, as well as a black spot on the hind border of the gill cover.|$|E
50|$|A {{dorsal fin}} is always present, {{and is the}} {{principal}} (in some species, the only) organ of locomotion. The ventral fins are consistently absent, and the other fins {{may or may not}} be developed. The <b>gill</b> <b>openings</b> are extremely small and placed near the upper posterior angle of the gill cover.|$|R
50|$|Parancistrus have stout {{bodies that}} are {{completely}} plated in adults. The dorsal fin membrane {{connects to the}} adipose fin spine. Their color is typically slate gray to black, occasionally with white streaks. They have large <b>gill</b> <b>openings,</b> which makes the genus different from all other loricariids except some Pogonopoma and Rhinelepis.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mouth is}} {{terminal}} and minute, conical teeth are in bands on the jaws, palatines, and vomer. The <b>gill</b> <b>openings</b> {{are small and}} are found dorsally on the posterior region of the discoid body. The rosy-lipped batfish only has {{two and a half}} gills, with none appearing on the reduced first gill arch.|$|R
