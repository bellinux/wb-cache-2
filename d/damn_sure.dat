40|$|How {{society will}} provide {{healthcare}} to its most vulnerable populations {{is a complex}} and difficult question that quality of life utilitarianism cannot resolve. The situation is further complicated by reflections on historic experience (i. e., Nazi Germany) and our own tendencies to devalue the neurologically vulnerable, the poor, and the genetically “impure. ” This paper reviews this issue practically and philosophically and concludes that {{the answer lies in}} the collective experience of western civilization that all human life must be intrinsically valued. On the basis of an experiential a priori: every individual is crowned with dignity. It all goes back to Aristotle. “All men are mortal ” is the major premise. “John is a man, ” is the minor premise. The conclusion is inescapable: “Therefore John is mortal. ” This paper is about that inevitability. As Pogo the philosopher (Kelly 1954) once put it, “We cannot be absolutely sure we are going to die, but we can be pretty <b>damned</b> <b>sure.</b> ” What then do we actually mean by saying that there is a special vulnerability of the sick that should drive our healthcare commitments?

Due to Soviet censorship, the book was not fully published in Russian until 1966 and the first UK translation, by Michael Glenny, appeared in London in 1967.
