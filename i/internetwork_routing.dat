This paper examines the cost of security and presents two techniques for efficient and secure processing of link state updates. The first technique is geared towards a relatively stable internetwork environment while the second is designed with a more volatile environment in mind. 1 Introduction It is hardly necessary to motivate the need for security in a large, distributed <b>internetwork</b> environment. Since <b>routing</b> is a critical internetwork function, security of routing protocols is of the utmost importance. This has been widely recognized by the designers of many existing routing protocols. Sound security, however, often comes at a high price. Naturally, it is desirable to minimize the associated costs. This paper concentrates on reducing the costs of security in link state routing protocols.

40|$|Current low-latency {{anonymity}} systems use complex overlay {{networks to}} conceal a user’s IP address, intro-ducing significant latency and network efficiency penalties compared to normal Internet usage. Rather than obfuscat-ing network identity through higher level protocols, we propose {{a more direct}} solution: a routing protocol that allows communication without exposing network identity, providing a strong foundation for Internet privacy, while allowing identity to be defined in those higher level proto-cols where it adds value. Given current research initiatives advocating “clean slate ” Internet designs, an opportunity exists to design an <b>internetwork</b> layer <b>routing</b> protocol that decouples identity from network location and thereby simplifies the anonymity problem. Recently, Hsiao et al. proposed such a protocol (LAP), {{but it does not}} protect the user against a local eavesdropper or an untrusted ISP, which will not be ac-ceptable for many users. Thus, we propose Dovetail, a next-generation Internet routing protocol that provides anony-mity against an active attacker located at any single point within the network, including the user’s ISP. A major design challenge is to provide this protection without including an application-layer proxy in data transmission. We address this challenge in path construction by using a matchmaker node (an end host) to overlap two path segments at a dovetail node (a router). The dovetail then trims away part of the path so that data transmission bypasses the matchmaker. Additional design features include the choice of many different paths through the network and the joining of path segments without requiring a trusted third party. We develop a systematic mechanism to measure the topological anonymity of our designs, and we demonstrate the privacy and efficiency of our proposal by simulation, using a model of the complete Internet at the AS-level. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} {{fundamental}} framework for a multi-service, heterogeneous internetworking architecture that provides probabilistic, end-to-end {{quality of service}} guarantees to the data application for short critical messages prior to transmission. The class of critical network messages spans many applications in the civilian and defense network realms, including command and control of crucial public infrastructure, early warning alerts, and military command dissemination. These network applications share {{a need for a}} high probability of successful delivery with stringent delay requirements. The IP Internet is not well-suited to bear mission-critical messages across administrative domain boundaries with these demands because IP is a purely best effort network service and Border Gateway Protocol intentionally obscures the detailed administrative domain state information needed to describe the performance of internetwork paths. Current solutions to critical messaging involve the quasi-static provisioning of circuit connections, an approach that is not scalable for general mission requirements. The Critical Service architecture presented in this work directly addresses the need to generate a priori probabilistic guarantees without explicit path reservation overhead in an on-demand and dynamic fashion. The Critical Service architecture leverages a logically-centralized control plane, divorced from the network data plane, which aggregates a compact set of performance state information from participating networks. While these networks retain autonomy and routing control, we introduce the State Measurement Service necessary to characterize the intranetwork services offered by these networks to critical message datagrams. The learned performance measurements are aggregated and pruned by a local controller such that only the minimal required internal state is revealed to the centralized arbiter. <b>Internetwork</b> <b>routing</b> decisions for critical messages are made on a transaction-specific basis using this global state information and the specified service demands of the network application. An algorithmic method is developed that discovers internetwork paths and composes diversity-routed solutions that satisfy the requested minimum reliability and maximum tolerable delay bound performance requirements. A form of source routing using the computed internetwork service enforces the network-granularity routing solution. by Matthew F. Carey. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|Platform heterogeneity, {{propagation}} delays, {{and link}} disruptions limit the scalability of sensing internetworking architectures. I present a challenged sensor internetwork (CSI) architecture that federates networks behind an overlay abstracted from individual data link layers. The associated delay-tolerant algorithms {{described in this}} work allow message exchange over otherwise incompatible networking stacks and enable novel concepts such as the NASA Solar System Internet (SSI). Border monitoring, undersea surveillance, and the SSI exemplify the need for spatially scaling networks. Existing deployments poorly address different physical links and frequent delays/disruptions. Virtual circuits abstracted from differences in the physical, data-link, and transport layers represent a unique solution {{to the problems of}} scaling diverse networks. I describe the CSI architecture as the intersection of wireless, delay-tolerant, and heterogeneous networks and describe special characteristics of this architecture that enable useful assumptions to optimize messaging. I define an <b>InterNetwork</b> <b>Routing</b> (INR) framework that decomposes the routing function into discrete logical steps and I provide algorithms for each of these steps. An inferred Contact Graph Routing (iCGR) algorithm populates logical graphs from local nodes. A Contact Graph Routing with Extension Blocks (CGR-EB) algorithm provides a hybrid source-path algorithm for synchronizing link state along network paths. A Predictive Capacity Consumption (PCC) algorithm exploits CGR-EB data to build a congestion model. Payload Aggregation/Fragmentation (PAF) and Traffic-Shaping Contacts (TSC) algorithms condition data and place limits on the amount of internetwork traffic carried over local networks. High fidelity simulations demonstrate performance in a variety of scenarios. iCGR performs within ~ 15 % of a perfect-knowledge system. CGR-EB has a speedup over standard approaches by 300 % in stable topologies, by 3000 % in unstable topologies, and by 11000 % in unstable topologies with non-monotonic cost functions. PCC delivers 97 % more data in congested networks over table-based approaches and 37 % more data than the INR framework without the congestion model. PAF/TSC reduces message count by 43 % while increasing goodput by 63 %. This work enables spatially distributed, scalable internetworks managed behind a consolidated data and control plane.

In the next decade military forces are planned to be much more mobile and dispersed than they are today. Improved sensors and information processing capabilities will provide information needed to manage defense actions against numerically superior enemy forces, but the effective use of that information will require greatly improved communications capability. The resultant digital information traffic which consists of bursts of data between and among users and data sources must be accomodated efficiently, something that neither the present circuit-switches nor the current store-and-forward message transmission systems do well. Also, there is a requirement for much more interoperability between the systems of different services and nations. <b>Internetwork</b> <b>routing</b> of data transmissions can provide more robust connectivity via alternate paths, to cope with jamming and physical attacks on specific transmission media or nodes. An approach to data network interconnection structure that has emerged {{over the past several years}} is the concept of a hierarchial set of protocol layers, each one building on the one below. In total, they constitute a reference model for “open systems interconnection. ” The most common version of such a reference model is the International Organization for Standardization’s reference model of Open Systems Interconnection (ISO OSI) (1). The ISO OSI model has been designed to serve the fixed plant, benign-environment commercial user. DoD has special needs for security, precedence, internetwork data transfer and user mobility that are not yet reflected in the ISO model. Because of these special needs candidate DoD models that are different from the ISO model have been proposed. However, an important consideration in the choice of or development of a DoD standard is that DoD Systems should be able to use commercial equipment and interface with commercial data networks. Also a consideration is that the reference model used for strategic and tactical communications should be a standard throughout DoD, although specific protocols could differ as necessary to support tactical vs. strategic needs. In total, these requirements and considerations constitute a significant design challenge that must be addressed promptly if DoD is to have any influence on the finalization of the ISO OSI model to get it to accomodate DoD requirements as much as possible...|$|E
