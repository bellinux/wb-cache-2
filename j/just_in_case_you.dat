Rishi also discovers that a man named Robert (also Mukesh Rishi) started working with Stephen right after Bhupathi's murder. Stephen and Robert became powerful underworld dons. Rishi suspects that his uncle's new identity is Robert. Rishi goes to Hyderabad. Rishi finds out that Stephen and Robert have an assistant, Nanu (Tej Sapru), who works in Bangkok. Nanu's daughter is Nandini (Tamannaah). Rishi and Nandini fall in love with each other. While drunk, Nanu shows his cell phone to Nandini because she wants to see the pictures of Stephen and Robert. Nanu falls asleep. Nandini calls Rishi's phone. Rishi sneaks into Nandini's room. When Rishi sees the pictures of Stephen and Robert, it's confirmed that Rishi's uncle's new identity is Robert. Since Simhadri told Rishi that a local goon helped Robert kill Bhupathi, that local goon must've been Stephen. Later, Raju tells Nandini about Rishi's tragic past. Nandini still wants to help Rishi locate Stephen and Robert. Rishi bribes Nanu's henchmen to stop protecting Nanu. Rishi tells his henchmen including Raju to take Nandini back to her home. Rishi tortures Nanu, until Nanu agrees to lure Stephen and Robert into a trap. Stephen and Robert arrive in a helicopter. It's revealed that Stephen and Robert sent 2 henchmen to disguise themselves as Stephen and Robert. Nanu and his henchmen didn't expect Stephen and Robert to fool Rishi. Nanu's glad that Stephen and Robert fooled Rishi. Rishi realizes that his bodyguards, including Raju and Nandini, got kidnapped by the bad guys. Robert calls Rishi's cell phone. Robert says, [...] "My informer followed Nanu for these past 2 years <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>case</b> if <b>you</b> tried to locate me.

40|$|For those {{keeping up}} on {{coverage}} of the Olympics and China, the new issue ofForeign Policy has a piece by John Hoberman, professor of German Studies at UT-Austin. In FP’s regular “Think Again” feature (which seeks to challenge conventional wisdom), Hoberman argues that the Olympics are political, are not intended to promote human rights, are not (necessarily) a catalyst for change, don’t generate a lot of revenue for the host or sponsors, are not the most controversial Games ever, and that the IOC is even more corrupt than already reported. In an additional piece, “Prime Numbers: Rings of Gold,” Brad Humphreys presents data {{to show that it}} isn’t the host countries that are making big money on the Games, but rather sponsors and the IOC itself. In her regular Olympics FAQs for us at China Beat, Susan Brownell has already debunked or complicated several of these ideas (check out all our Beijing Olympics coverage here). If you’d like to get a second peek at Brownell’s Olympic writing, she has revamped several of her China Beat posts for Japan Focus and The Huffington Post. If you are having trouble tracking all the Olympic rules, the Wall Street JournalChina Blog has put together a primer, including links to the 128 -page list (in Chinese) of guidelines for Olympic spectators (<b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>case</b> those of <b>you</b> making the trip to Beijing needed a little light plane reading). Danwei features a story today on Olympics security (and it’s worth taking a look if only for the picture of the Segway assault squad). CDT has an interview with Chinese journalists about the Olympic Games, Beijing pollution continues to be a central story (such as in yesterday’s report on Marketplace and at Time), and various bloggers, from CLB toSinosplice, have been detailing the visa crackdown. In physical fitness-related news, Rebecca MacKinnon has a fabulously-linked poston the early-July fascination with push-ups in China following the Weng’an Riots, and, since the push-up meme was in part a way to circumvent internet censorship of discussions of the riots, you might also find interesting David Bandurski’s piece at FEER on Communist Party web infiltrators...|$|R

In this paper, we present some examples of a quite different notion of applied sociology: one in which sociological insights are applied {{to the design of}} computer software. Sociology’s primary concern as a discipline can be considered to be the study of the interaction of agents, where ‘agents ’ are generally assumed to be people or human collectivities. The kind of application of sociology which we discuss trades on the possibility of widening the scope of agency to include non-animate systems. The success of this kind of applied sociology will depend in part on the degree to which artifacts can be considered to be agent...|$|E
