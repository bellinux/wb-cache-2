5|$|Given {{represented}} the Republic of Ireland at youth level before earning five caps for the Republic of Ireland national under-21 team. Although {{he did not}} become a regular first team player for Blackburn Rovers, Given's performances while on loan at Swindon and Sunderland led to him being called up to the Republic of Ireland squad in 1996. He made his debut for the national team on 27 March 1996, {{in a game against}} Russia. Although Ireland failed to qualify for the 1998 FIFA World Cup or UEFA Euro 2000, Given established himself as first-choice goalkeeper. He played <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nation's games at the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

5|$|Having been {{interested}} in aviation {{since he was a}} boy, Plagis volunteered for the Southern Rhodesian Air Force (SRAF) soon after the outbreak of war in September 1939. He was turned down because {{he was the son of}} foreign nationals and therefore not a citizen, despite having lived in Rhodesia all his life. After Italy invaded Greece in late October 1940, bringing the Greeks into the war on the Allied side, Plagis applied again—this time to join the Royal Air Force, which had absorbed the SRAF in April 1940—and was accepted. Training first in Southern Rhodesia, then England, Plagis passed out with the rank of flight sergeant in June 1941 with above-average ratings <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> flying assessments.|$|E
5|$|He is the player's first {{opponent}} <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{roles and}} {{is famous for}} his weakness and cowardice. These elements are considered by critics to be stereotypes of French people.

Glass Joe {{is considered one of}} the most well-known characters in the Punch-Out!! series and a Nintendo icon. His name has been used to describe poor performance by sportspeople and teams. In The Wii game his dialogue consists of him pleading not for the player to strike him in the jaw, complaints about the tightness of his gloves, and counting to ten in French.|$|E

5|$|Literary scholar M. Keith Booker {{argues that}} Vargas Llosa perfects the {{technique}} of interlacing dialogues in his novel The Green House. By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates {{the illusion of a}} flashback. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places. This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using {{near the end of his}} first novel, The Time of the Hero. However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> novels. For example, in The Green House the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space. In contrast, Captain Pantoja and the Special Service employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts. This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf's mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.|$|E
5|$|Principal Skinner has put Bart in detention. While dusting a desk, {{he finds}} an Aramaic inscription.

For his final test, he must torture Homer; despite Bart's hesitation, Homer lets him. A disfigured Homer proudly watches Bart graduate from Hell school as valedictorian.|$|E

A 5000 metres win at the KBC Night of Athletics brought Zersenay an Eritrean record of 13:11.07, and a place at the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. At the 2003 World Championships, he improved his record further to 13:05.57 and finished in eighth place in the 5000 metres final.

5|$|The {{carousel}} {{is one of}} {{the three}} oldest surviving Dentzel menagerie carousels. Thirty-one of its 42wood-carved animals are horses, 17 standing and 14 jumping. There are also three goats, three giraffes, three deer, one lion, and one tiger. The single lion and tiger are typical of Dentzel-created carousels, as are the three giraffes; Gustav Dentzel's love of that animal resulted <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> carousels including at least one row of giraffes. The animals are arranged in three circles around the central mechanism, alternating leaping or jumping horses with stationary animals. Typical for a Mangels-Illions manufactured carousel, there are 18jumping animals, all but one of which is original; the horse that could not be found in 1975 was replaced with another Dentzel horse. Although the animals were not originally carved to display jewels, at some point they were so displayed at the amusement park, and thus the museum restored the animals on the outside circle with jewels.|$|E
5|$|The {{estate is}} {{strongly}} reminiscent of Romanesque architecture, mainly due to alterations {{made to the}} house and grounds by Davenport.

5|$|In 2006, Marcelo Weksler {{published}} a large-scale cladistic analysis of Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), the tribe to which O.polius belongs. He used both morphological data and molecular characters from the IRBP gene. <b>In</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> analyses, O.polius {{was found to}} be part of clade D, one of four large groups within Oryzomyini, as the sister group to a clade containing all the other species of clade D. Clade D was supported by two shared derived (synapomorphic) molecular characters and by seven morphological synapomorphies—the tail has a different color above and below; the parietal bone extends {{to the side of the}} skull; the incisive foramina (openings in the palate) extend back between the first molars; the posterolateral palatal pits (perforations of the palate near the third molars) are complex; the sphenopalatine vacuities (openings in the mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the end of the palate) are large; the pattern of the arterial circulation in the head is derived; and the posteroloph (a crest at the back) is present on the third upper molar. Two other molecular synapomorphies supported the clade of all members of clade D except O.polius, coupled with three morphological traits—in these species, but not in O.polius, the first upper molar has an additional small root at the outer (labial) side; the first lower molar has additional small roots; and the second upper molar has the mesoflexus (one of the valleys between the cusps and crests) divided in two.|$|E
