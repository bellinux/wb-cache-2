Restrictions on the internal use of foreign currency can cause the domestic currency to be relatively more valuable to domestic agents while taxes on domestic currency create an incentive for home agents to hold foreign currency. We demonstrate that some policies increase prices and lower welfare while others do the reverse.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} trust {{issues and}} challenges have been encountered by e-government developers {{during the process of}} adoption of online public services. Despite of the apparent benefits as online services’ immediacy and saving costs, the rate of adoption of e-government is globally below experts’ expectations. A concern about e-government adoption is extended to trust issues which are inhibiting a citizen’s acceptance of online public sector services or engagement with e-government initiates. A citizen’s decision to use online systems is influenced by their willingness to trust the environment and to the agency is involved. Trust makes citizens comfortable sharing personal information and making online <b>government</b> <b>transaction.</b> Therefore, trust is a significant notion that should be critically investigated in context of different E-Taxation models as part of E-Government initiatives.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a unified framework for examining international payment patterns. Using an open-economy search model with competing monetary assets, I show how information costs and <b>government</b> <b>transaction</b> policies interact {{to produce a}} structure of world payments reminiscent with what is observed in practice. Agents ’ decision to acquire information shapes exchange patterns by affecting a currency’s usefulness in trade — or, its liquidity. Due to network effects and complementarities in optimal choices, there is persistence and hysteresis in monetary leadership, even if the payment pattern is socially inefficient. While high inflation can lead to dollarization, a sufficiently large local government can de-dollarize the economy by inducing a switch to national currency use. By using simple transaction policies that promote the use of local money, governments can reverse exchange patterns, despite inertia. A calibration of the generalized model shows how changes in information costs or inflation can make hegemony shift from a dollar-dominated monetary system to a multi-polar regime. The welfare benefits of having an international currency are also discussed and compared with previous estimates...|$|E

40|$|MBA 2012 ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to identify the challenges and benefits associated with healthcare infrastructure provision by Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) in South Africa. Contract choice and the initial conditions that have to be met strongly influence {{the success or failure of}} PPPs (Pollitt and Bouckaert (2000). How the challenges associated with PPPs are perceived by industry experts and government specialists, contributes to their choice of procurement in the delivery of healthcare infrastructure provision. Ten research questions in the form of perceptions were identified from the literature, and accordingly were to be tested within the South African context to reveal their appropriateness. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data from several public-private partnership practitioners within the South African health sector. Fifteen interviews were conducted with experienced and senior ranking stakeholders from both the public and private sectors representing <b>government,</b> <b>transaction</b> advisors and construction professionals. Content analysis was then performed on the data collected. The research argues that not all of the ten identified propositions were applicable to the South African public-private partnership environment. Notably propositions like the rapid delivery of infrastructure barely getting any agreement. However perceptions formulated outside the literature review proved to be more significant, like the perception that PPPs facilitates core business focus enabling the government to focus on their core function of providing health services to the public, and that the true life cycle cost considerations enable longer lifespans for the infrastructure. Interestingly, the findings of this work in terms of levels of significance generally differed with the conclusions of related research that was discussed in the literature...|$|E

Trade extends the chain of custody and transaction documentation across national boundaries. Broad access to commercial and <b>government</b> <b>transaction</b> records could occur using an international system of unique transaction numbers, i. e. an enhancement of the Unique Consignment Reference (UCR) already developed by the World Customs Organization. This enhanced vision (UCR II) requires multinational agreement to adopt several new measures, including abandonment of multiple business identity numbers and their replacement across government record systems by the EAN*UCC Global Location Number (GLN) and expansion of the business registration process to include issue of corporate PKI signature packages and obligatory testing for a minimum number of the personnel from each business for their e-commerce skills and knowledge. All of this would be a condition of new or renewed business registrations. UCR II, as a globally applied unique transaction number, would be composed of the GLNs of the seller and buyer plus a date/time stamp for the transaction. Once all commercial and trade files for a transaction are tagged in this way, national jurisdictions could assemble virtual files for risk assessment within a shared 24 / 7 secure communications network. No massive, centralized databases are envisaged. The proposed shared system, for where-who-what tracking of freight records, could give full supply chain visibility to each jurisdiction involved in the routing. The infrastructure used to monitor international movements could bring the same transparency to domestic movements. The paper ends by identifying six parties in a position and with the capacity to become the champion of UCR II in the multinational discussions necessary to its adoption.
