30|$|Likewise, {{sensitivity}} {{analysis of the}} <b>FORs</b> of the equipment has been conducted. The {{results show that the}} DGs, being the main power sources, {{play a vital role in}} the planning of a stand-alone microgrid. As the DG <b>FORs</b> increase, the installed capacity of the diesel generating system increases, unlike WES and BESS. However, the <b>FORs</b> of WES and BESS have little impact on the optimal configurations, due to their non-significant impacts on system reliability performance. In planning studies, to calculate the system reliability indices, it’s acceptable to assume that the WTGs have zero <b>FORs,</b> as well as the BESS acting as the role of storing the renewable energy.|$|R
