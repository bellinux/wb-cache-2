At the 2004 games, she won a bronze medal in the T53 100m, behind Tanni Grey-Thompson and Francesca Porcellato. Her goal for the 2008 Beijing Paralympics was to set a {{personal}} best, but she also <b>had</b> <b>eyes</b> on a medal. She took the year off her psychology degree to train six times a week. At the 2008 games, along with her team mates Christie Dawes, Madison de Rozario, and Jemima Moore, she achieved her best Paralympic result, winning a silver medal behind China's world record in the T53/54 4x100m relay. In the individual events, she finished fifth in the women's T53 100m event (a race won in world record time by Huang Lisha), seventh in the women's T53 200m event (also won in a world record time by Huang), seventh in the women's T53 400m event, and led out the women's 800m final, eventually finishing sixth. After a couple of sub-par competition results in 2011, Ballard made big changes to her diet, gloves, technique, chair position, and training regime. She entered the 2012 London Paralympics ranked world number one in both the T53 100m and 200m. At the games, Ballard participated in the T53 class events for 100m, 200m, 400m and 800m events. She won two silver medals in the 200m and 400m T53 events, and a bronze medal in the 100m T53 event.|$|E

25|$|Hattusili's son, Tudhaliya IV, was {{the last}} strong Hittite king {{able to keep the}} Assyrians out of the Hittite heartland to some degree at least, though he too lost much {{territory}} to them, and was heavily defeated by Tukulti-Ninurta I of Assyria in the Battle of Nihriya. He even temporarily annexed the Greek island of Cyprus, before that too fell to Assyria. The very last king, Suppiluliuma II also managed to win some victories, including a naval battle against Alashiya off the coast of Cyprus. But the Assyrians, under Ashur-resh-ishi I had by this time annexed much Hittite territory in Asia Minor and Syria, driving out and defeating the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar I in the process, who also <b>had</b> <b>eyes</b> on Hittite lands. The Sea Peoples had already begun their push down the Mediterranean coastline, starting from the Aegean, and continuing all the way to Canaan, founding the state of Philistia—taking Cilicia and Cyprus away from the Hittites en route and cutting off their coveted trade routes. This left the Hittite homelands vulnerable to attack from all directions, and Hattusa was burnt to the ground sometime around 1180 BC following a combined onslaught from new waves of invaders, the Kaskas, Phrygians and Bryges. The Hittite Kingdom thus vanished from historical records, much of the territory being seized by Assyria. The end of the kingdom was part of the larger Bronze Age Collapse.|$|E
500|$|As human analysts {{using the}} {{technique}} lead to subjective biases, {{efforts have been}} made to make more objective estimates using computer programs, which have been aided by higher-resolution satellite imagery and more powerful computers. [...] Since tropical cyclone satellite patterns can fluctuate over time, automated techniques use a six-hour averaging period to lead to more reliable intensity estimates. [...] Development of the objective Dvorak technique began in 1998, which performed best with tropical cyclones that <b>had</b> <b>eyes</b> (of hurricane or typhoon strength). [...] It still required a manual center placement, keeping some subjectivity within the process. [...] By 2004, an advanced objective Dvorak technique was developed which utilized banding features for systems below hurricane intensity and to objectively determine the tropical cyclone's center. [...] A central pressure bias was uncovered in 2004 relating to the slope of the tropopause and cloud top temperatures which change with latitude that helped improve central pressure estimates within the objective technique.|$|E

His versatility drew praise from opposing coaches, including George Halas of the Chicago Bears and Steve Owen of the New York Giants. Former Bears quarterback Johnny Lujack lauded McElhenny as [...] "the best running back I have seen in a long, long time." [...] Also noted was his vision; he had an uncanny ability of seeing and reacting to tacklers in his peripheral vision. [...] "If you ever watched McElhenny", explained Washington State coach Jim Sutherland, [...] "you'd think he <b>had</b> <b>eyes</b> {{on the back of}} his head. I've seen him cut away from a tackler that 99 percent of the backs wouldn't even have seen. It wasn't instinct—he just saw the guy, out of the corner of his eye." [...] McElhenny described his playing style as such: [...] "My attitude carrying the ball was fear—not a fear of getting hurt but a fear of getting caught from behind and taken down and embarrassing myself and my teammates." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} Broadway production {{opened at}} the Majestic Theatre on April 19, 1945. [...] The dress rehearsal the day before had gone badly, and the pair feared the new work would not be well received. [...] One successful last-minute change was to have de Mille choreograph the pantomime. [...] The movement of the carnival crowd in the pantomime had been entrusted to Mamoulian, and his version was not working. [...] Rodgers had injured his back the previous week, and he watched the opening from a stretcher propped in a box behind the curtain. [...] Sedated with morphine, he could see {{only part of the}} stage. [...] As he could not hear the audience's applause and laughter, he assumed the show was a failure. [...] It was not until friends congratulated him later that evening that he realized that the curtain had been met by wild applause. [...] Bambi Linn, who played Louise, was so enthusiastically received by the audience during her ballet that she was forced to break character, when she next appeared, and bow. [...] Rodgers' daughter Mary caught sight of her friend, Stephen Sondheim, both teenagers then, across several rows; both <b>had</b> <b>eyes</b> wet with tears.|$|E
500|$|However, other reviews were positive. After Briggs' {{review was}} published, {{a large number}} of letters {{supportive}} of the show were sent to the magazine, prompting it to [...] "take a second look" [...] at the show, with Matt Shumway and Lamont Wayne writing a much more positive review, calling it [...] "a fresh show with very different approaches". The Sarasota Herald-Tribune was highly positive of the show and felt that the show's lively animation and slapstick humor recalled [...] "the delight of earlier cartoon era", writing: [...] "In times of old, cartoon characters <b>had</b> <b>eyes</b> that bugged out when they drank something unpleasant, legs that became whirling circles when they ran and bodies that flattened into pancakes when they crashed into slammed doors. Well, they're ba-a-a-ck." [...] The Herald Sun considered Ed, Edd n Eddy an animated mixture of well-known classic TV shows, noting [...] "just imagine Dexter in his laboratory working on some new project for the Cartoon Network when he tunes into The Little Rascals and The Three Stooges. Alfalfa, Spanky, Moe and Curly really excite the wunderkind who decides to extract some DNA from the old TV legends. Into the test tubes with the DNA ... add a little animation and Dexter has Ed, Edd N Eddy".|$|E
500|$|The Zany (orig. Spanish el Pelele), also {{translated}} as the Idiot by some critics, appears {{only in the}} first four chapters and again at the end of chapter seven but serves a critical function in the novel. The Zany, who [...] "looked like a corpse when he was asleep" [...] and <b>had</b> <b>eyes</b> that [...] "saw nothing, felt nothing" [...] is critical to establishing the tone of the novel and triggering the novel's action. Critic John Walker argues that, by [...] "choosing the Idiot {{as a representative of the}} innocent, the a-political, who suffer the abuses of a totalitarian regime [...] Asturias shows how dictatorship corrupts people and destroys their values to the extent that compassion for one's companion in distress ceases to exist." [...] In fact, it becomes clear that the only happiness that the Zany experiences is through the memory of his dead mother. Asturias then shows how el Pelele, a mother-loving figure, [...] "suffers at the hands of those who, long under the domination of the over-aggressive father figure, lack love and pity". Furthermore, el Pelele [...] is a tool that allows readers to see the psychological effects of living under a dictatorship ruled by terror. His murderous act seems to trigger the subsequent events of the novel and to impact on all the characters. Also important is the fact that the one moment of complete happiness experienced by the Zany in the novel takes place while he is in a dream-like state. Walker argues that this serves to highlight the harsh, nightmarish world of reality in which he has been forced to live.|$|E

500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on Mwng feature quite solemn, {{personal}} lyrics, which reflect on a difficult few years for Rhys. The single, [...] "Ysbeidiau Heulog", is about [...] "looking back at a bad time which had the odd good moment", while [...] "Pan Ddaw'r Wawr" [...] deals {{with the death of}} rural communities. The singer claims to have wept—rather than sung—the album's last track, [...] "Gwreiddiau Dwfn" [...] / [...] "Mawrth Oer Ar y Blaned Neifion", which features lyrics [...] "so bleak it's almost comic" [...] about [...] "being rooted to a sad piece of land [...] being doomed to live somewhere and that's all you have and that's what you're stuck with". Rhys has described Datblygu's [...] "Y Teimlad" [...] as being about [...] "not knowing what love is or what love means." [...] "Drygioni" [...] is a song about [...] "sleaze [...] about good versus evil, and a person's need for both", and [...] "Y Gwyneb Iau" [...] is a [...] "moody song about war" [...] whose title is a Welsh insult that translates into English as [...] "Liverface". In contrast, [...] "Nythod Cacwn" [...] is a comedic song, based on an incident involving drummer Dafydd Ieuan being chased by bees after he disturbed a beehive while attempting to build a bonfire on a beach. It features lyrics that were [...] "made up on the spot" [...] by Rhys. [...] "Dacw Hi" [...] is inspired by one of Rhys's former teachers who claimed she <b>had</b> <b>eyes</b> {{in the back of her}} head. [...] "Sarn Helen" [...] is about the decline of the Roman road of the same name that was built between North and South Wales. [...] "Ymaelodi Â'r Ymylon" [...] is partly inspired by the ostracisation the band felt from some areas of the Welsh musical community due to their decision to sing in English on earlier albums. The track's lyrics feature the old Welsh idiom [...] "y cythraul canu", which means [...] "the demon in music" [...] and refers to the friction this can create between people.|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{new laws}} were typical of {{censorship}} laws in many {{other countries in the}} 1920s and 1930s, they were implemented with an eagerness which gradually alienated and embittered many Irish writers. It caused some writers to leave the country. The author Mervyn Wall explains that during the 1930s there was 'a general intolerant attitude to writing, painting and sculpture. These were thought dangerous, likely to corrupt faith and morals...One encountered frequently among ordinary people bitter hostility to writers...Obscurantism had settled on the country like a fog, so of course anyone who <b>had</b> <b>eyes</b> to see and the heart to feel, was rebellious.' The Academy of Letters established by William Butler Yeats attempted to fight censorship with solidarity among writers, but it achieved little in this field. The fight against literary censorship was fought mainly by isolated figures. Seán Ó Faoláin, perhaps the most vociferous critic of the censorship laws, wrote: 'Our Censorship...tries to keep the mind in a state of perpetual adolescence {{in the midst of all}} the influences that must, in spite of it, pour in from the adult world.' ...|$|E

2500|$|Deep Purple's troubled North American record label, Tetragrammaton, delayed {{production}} of the Deep Purple album until after the band's 1969 American tour ended. [...] This, as well as lackluster promotion by the nearly broke label, caused the album to sell poorly, finishing well out of the Billboard Top 100. Soon after the third album's eventual release, Tetragrammaton went out of business, leaving the band with no money and an uncertain future. (Tetragrammaton's assets were assumed by Warner Bros. Records, who would release Deep Purple's records in the US throughout the 1970s.) During the 1969 American tour, Lord and Blackmore met with Paice to discuss their desire to take the band in a heavier direction. [...] Feeling that Evans and Simper would not fit well with a heavy rock style, both were replaced that summer. Paice stated, [...] "A change had to come. If they hadn't left, the band would have totally disintegrated." [...] Both Simper and Blackmore noted that Rod Evans already had one foot out the door.

And in England, and I was sure in America, they loved animals."

The first singles were hits. [...] "I Love My Dog", charting on the UK Singles Chart at number 28, and [...] "Matthew and Son", the title song from his debut album, went to number 2 in the UK. [...] "I'm Gonna Get Me a Gun" [...] was his second UK top 10, reaching number 6, and the album Matthew and Son reached number 7 on the UK Albums Chart.
