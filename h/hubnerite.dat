25|$|The {{chemical}} composition may vary between end member species {{of a solid}} solution series. For example, the plagioclase feldspars comprise a continuous series from sodium-rich end member albite (NaAlSi3O8) to calcium-rich anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8) with four recognized intermediate varieties between them (given in order from sodium- to calcium-rich): oligoclase, andesine, labradorite, and bytownite. Other examples of series include the olivine series of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite, and the wolframite series of manganese-rich <b>hübnerite</b> and iron-rich ferberite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hübnerite</b> {{is a rare}} {{member of}} the {{wolframite}} group. <b>Hübnerite</b> usually found within pegmatites and high-temperature quartz veins. <b>Hübnerite</b> does not occur by itself, but is typically associated with other minerals such as cassiterite, scheelite, quartz, galena, arsenopyrite, native bismuth, pyrite, and sphalerite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hübnerite</b> {{was not the}} {{original}} name giving to the mineral. <b>Hübnerite</b> is the synonym of {{the original}} name megabasite. The name megabasite was given to mineral by A. Breithaupt in 1852. The name <b>hübnerite</b> was given the mineral by E.N Riotte in 1865 to honor the metallurgist Adolph Hübner.|$|E
50|$|The color {{difference}} in the members is clear and marked. The color of <b>hübnerite</b> has a variation from yellowish brown to reddish brown. Crystal and crystalline masses of <b>hübnerite</b> show a verity of lusters from adamantine, submetallic to resinous luster. In thin splints, <b>hübnerite</b> can be either transparent or translucent. The streak {{is related to the}} color being a shade lighter. All the wolframite family members possess a perfect cleavage on {010}. On {100} and {102} there is less-well developed parting. In <b>hübnerite</b> the fracture is brittle and uneven. Is common for all members of the wolframite to show simple contact twins on {100} or rarely interpenetrant twins on {001}. The hardness of <b>hübnerite</b> is between 4 and 4.5 and specific gravity between 7.12 and 7.18.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>hübnerite</b> {{comes from}} a family with only two end members {{it would be easier}} to explain the {{composition}} of the wolframite family since there is not enough data on <b>hübnerite</b> itself. The primary formula of the wolframite series is (Fe,Mn)WO4. The domination of either iron or manganese would result in forming one of two minerals. The iron dominated one will result in forming ferberite while the manganese dominated one will result in forming <b>hübnerite.</b> <b>Hübnerite</b> is rarer than ferberite due to the difficulty of iron and manganese substitution. There is also a magnesium substitution involved to form an MgWO4. This magnesium rich usually referred to as wolframite but it is not a mineral it is a crystal scintillator.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hübnerite</b> or <b>hubnerite</b> is {{a mineral}} {{consisting}} of manganese tungsten oxide (chemical formula: MnWO4, it isn't a tungstate). It is the manganese endmember of the manganese - iron wolframite solid solution series. It forms reddish brown to black monoclinic prismatic submetallic crystals. The crystals are typically flattened and occur with fine striations. It {{has a high}} specific gravity of 7.15 and a Mohs hardness of 4.5. It is transparent to translucent with perfect cleavage. Refractive index values are nα=2.170 - 2.200, nβ=2.220, and nγ=2.300 - 2.320.|$|E
50|$|Ferberite is {{the iron}} endmember of the {{manganese}} - iron wolframite solid solution series. The manganese endmember is <b>hübnerite.</b> Ferberite {{is a black}} monoclinic mineral composed of iron(II) tungstate, FeWO4.|$|E
50|$|Tungsten {{is found}} {{mainly in the}} mineral {{wolframite}} (iron-manganese tungstate (Fe,Mn)WO4, which is a solid solution of the two minerals ferberite FeWO4, and <b>hübnerite</b> MnWO4) and scheelite (calcium tungstate (CaWO4). Other tungsten minerals range in their level of abundance from moderate to very rare, and have almost no economical value.|$|E
50|$|Wolframite, (Fe,Mn)WO4, is an iron {{manganese}} tungstate mineral {{that is the}} intermediate between ferberite (Fe2+ rich) and <b>hübnerite</b> (Mn2+ rich). Along with scheelite, the wolframite series {{are the most important}} tungsten ore minerals. Wolframite is found in quartz veins and pegmatites associated with granitic intrusives. Associated minerals include cassiterite, scheelite, bismuth, quartz, pyrite, galena, sphalerite, and arsenopyrite.|$|E
50|$|As <b>hübnerite</b> {{is a rare}} endmember of the {{wolframite}} {{group the}} structure of the family will be {{the structure of the}} members. Distorted tetrahedral (WO4) and octahedral ((Fe. Mn)O6) is the usual structure of all member in the wolframite family. Complete solid solution occurs between Fe2+ and Mn2+ in the members of the series. In ferberite the percentage of WO3 is around 76.3% while in <b>hübnerite</b> the percentage is around 76.6%. In natural occurrence the percent range fall within 20-80 percent of the wolframite series. In the past it was thought the wolframite family possess orthorhombic symmetry but in fact it is possess monoclinic symmetry. Short prismatic, flattened or wedge-shaped are the common crystals of the wolframite itself. In some rare occasions the crystals occur doubly terminated. It is common for the faces to striated parallel to the c axis. In most cases wolframite is embedded in quartz as subparallel crystalline masses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hübnerite</b> {{is a rare}} mineral {{from the}} rare family wolframite. It is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} principle ores of tungsten. It is usually identified by the dark color, one direction of perfect cleavage and high specific gravity all serving to distinguish it from other minerals. The first recorded identification of the wolframite family was back in 1948 but it was not added as a mineral until 1951.|$|E
50|$|The {{ore deposit}} is a {{porphyry}} type, similar to many large copper deposits, where many intersecting small veins of molybdenite form a stockwork in an altered quartz monzonite porphyry. Like other porphyry-type ore deposits, the ore is low-grade, {{much less than}} one percent molybdenum, but the ore bodies are very large. Beside molybdenum, the mine has also produced tin (from cassiterite), tungsten (from <b>hübnerite),</b> and pyrite as by-products.|$|E

40|$|Electron {{microprobe}} {{data are}} presented from zoned niobian wolframite crystals in a quartz-wolframite-(cassiterite) vein and wall-rock from a zinnwaldite-bearing granite pluton that forms {{part of the}} late-Caledonian Glen Gairn granitic complex in the Eastern Highlands of Scotland. Compositions range from Nb- and Ta-rich wolframite, (Fe,Mn) (W,Nb,Ta) O 4, forming strongly zoned, difficult-to-polish regions of crystals, to almost pure <b>hübnerite</b> MnWO 4, forming relatively unzoned, easily polished regions. Nb and Ta substitution is very restricted in Mn-rich (> 80 mol% <b>hübnerite)</b> wolframites but increases regularly in more Fe-rich compositions through a coupled substitution mechanism between Mn 2 + W 6 + and Fe 3 + (Nb,Ta) 5 +. Most of the wolframite crystals contain two forms of zonation: a physical zonation, observed optically and by electron imaging, and a compositional zonation revealed by X-ray traverses. Compositional zoning is progressive, involving gradual changes in mineral chemistry from core to rim, on which is superimposed a form of oscillatory zoning involving repeated resetting of compositions. Physical zones are layers of uniform width separated by distinct boundaries; they are arranged parallel to crystal faces and reflect intermittent crystal growth. These zones vary in width from less than 5 m in the niobium-rich wolframite, to over 200 m in regions of niobium-poor hübneritic wolframite. Hydrothermal alteration, particularly of the intensely zoned niobium-rich regions, has resulted in assemblages of altered Nb- and Ta-rich wolframite (tungstite?), secondary hübneritic wolframite and scheelite. Nb-rich inclusions 5 - 10 m across are found sporadically in the larger wolframite crystals. Progressive variation in wolframite chemistry is readily {{explained in terms of}} gradually changing physiochemical conditions, such as pH, f O 2, temperature, pressure and fluid composition, during crystallization. The oscillatory zonation reflects cyclicity of those conditions. Plausible models which could explain such effects include: 1. (a) intermittent mixing of chemically distinct magmatic and meteoric fluids 2. (b) repeated hydraulic fracturing and injection of fluids leading to fluctuating pressure and temperature of the hydrothermal fluid. Volatile species (F, Cl, CO 2) may have been effective as complexing agents thus affecting the supply of Nb from the fluid. Deposition of Nb- and Ta-rich compositions were probably favoured by high f O 2, low pH conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{tungstate}} bearing minerals including scheelite, stolzite ferberite, <b>hübnerite,</b> wolframite, russellite, tungstenian wulfenite and cuprotungstite have been analysed by Raman microscopy. The {{results of the}} Raman spectroscopic analysis are compared with published data. These minerals are closely related and often have related paragenesis. Raman microscopy enables the selection of individual crystals of these minerals for spectroscopic analysis even though several of the minerals {{can be found in}} the same matrix because of the pargenetic relationships between the minerals. The Raman spectra are assigned according to factor group analysis and related to the structure of the minerals. These minerals have characteristically different Raman spectra. The ￮ 1 (Ag) band is observed at 909 cm- 1 and although the corresponding ￮ 1 (Bu) vibration should be inactive a minor band is observed around 894 cm- 1. The bands at 790 and 881 cm- 1 are associated with the antisymmetric and symmetric Ag modes of terminal WO 2.

40|$|Catamarcaite, ideally Cu 6 GeWS 8, was {{discovered}} in bornite-rich ore from old dumps near the La Rosario vein, Capillitas epithermal deposit, Catamarca Province, Argentina. The new mineral is associated with bornite, digenite, chalcocite, covellite, sphalerite, <b>hübnerite,</b> luzonite, wittichenite, several Ge-bearing sulfi des (putzite, unnamed Cu 8 Fe 2 ZnGe 2 S 12, and a briartite-type phase) and quartz. Catamarcaite occurs as a thin rim lining cavities and fractures in chalcocite–bornite ore, and as aggregates, up to 1 mm in size, composed of anhedral to subhedral, intensely twinned grains within digenite – chalcocite – sphalerite ore. The mineral is opaque, grey, has a metallic luster and a black streak. It is brittle, and the fracture is irregular to subconchoidal. Neither cleavage nor parting is evident in polished sections. VHN 25 ranges between 193 and 264 (mean 227) kg/mm 2, which corresponds to a Mohs hardness of 3. The density could not be measured {{because of the small}} grain-size. Using the ideal formula and the unit-cell parameters from powder data, the calculated density is 4. 892 g/cm 3. In plane-polarized refl ected light, catamarcaite is greyish white with a distinct brownish tint. It shows no pleochroism, and the birefl ectance is absent in air and very weak in oil.
