40|$|It is {{with great}} enthusiasm that <b>I</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>you</b> {{to the first}} bladder cancer supple-ment of the CUAJ. As Editor of this supplement, I am excited to present you withup-to-date issues in bladder cancer written by Canadian and {{international}} physi-cians and scientists. The supplement highlights key aspects of bladder cancer from the management of T 1 G 3 tumours and BCG failures to the management of advanced can-cers, including the role of lymphadenectomy, urethrectomy, perioperative chemother-apy and metastasectomy. The supplement also addresses the future prospects towards the pathways of personalized medicine. Authors review the impact of nonurothelial histology, as well as risk-adapted and treatment adapted surveillance strategies. Controversial issues are debated: Is there a niche for prostate-sparing cystectomy? Is bladder cancer screening ready for prime time? Does chemoprevention {{have a place in}} bladder cancer? These {{are just a few of}} the questions that the supplement attempts to answer. I congratulate all the authors who have contributed toward this supplement. I know you have worked hard on this endeavour and I hope this final product complements the reader’s needs and your expectations. On a global note, the actual prevalence of bladder cancer is 10 times its incidence...|$|E

40|$|My {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} nutrition of diabetic people with continuous insulin pump. The theoretical part describes diabetes mellitus as a disease. In this part I describe you treatment possibility and also <b>I</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>you</b> {{the way of}} eating. In my research there were involved ten respondents, who suffer from diabetes mellitus {{and all of them}} were treated with continuous diabetic pump. This research includes two parts. At first I want to findout and evaluate rating habits of diabetics who have insulin pump. And I will compare these results with recommendation of Diabetic Czech Society. To reach this, I used record dairy, where I follow these parameters: eaten food, measured blood glucose value and physical activity for 1 week. For second part of this research I use interview. I try to find out how patients, who live with continuous insulin pump evaluated their current rating habits. From analysed data it is clear that respondents have much less calorie intake than they really need. Despite the fact that most respondents have right food composition forms with recommendation of CDS. Amount of cholesterol in their diet do not exceed daily recommendation about 300 mg per day. On the other hand recommended daily dose offibres 30 grams and in our case respondents received half less. About 11 grams per day. The assessment of interviews shows that the diabetics are satisfied with continuous insulin pump. Thanks to this, {{they do not have to}} follow regular regime. They are also able to work in places where the regular regime is not possible. These results can be used as a study material for diabetic people who are treated with continuous insulin pump. Study material could be a leaflet in diabetic clinics...|$|E
40|$|Stories about HIV are everywhere. They {{are told}} (i. e. constructed), heard (i. e. taken in) and then re-told (i. e. shared). It {{is when we}} start asking {{questions}} about such stories, that new story "versions" become available; to be told, heard and possibly retold. Given the methodological boundaries connected to HIV research, few research studies are able to utilize the research context to venture beyond the mere collection (i. e. hearing) and re-telling (i. e. sharing) of story experiences. As a result, the hidden, alternative story "versions" which are "awakened" during the research process, may remain untold. Over the course of 4 months, the researcher utilized the existing dialogical space of the therapy context, as a practical platform for researching the dominant, {{as well as the}} "absent but implicit" meaning of HIV. Through ongoing dialogical interaction, this research journey set out, to not only hear the dominant stories told about HIV, but also to explore the hidden, preferred alternative story "versions". An adolescent girl living with HIV acquired through mother-to-child transmission, collaborated with the researcher to engage in this journey of therapeutic co-research. With this narrative report, I invite you to become an audience member to this unfolding journey. Throughout this report, I used the word "journey" as a guiding metaphor, situating the act of meaning making as a collaborative ongoing process of co-research, rather than a collection of facts. This research report is a narrative in itself and is subdivided into three parts. Part I includes all chapters written before my journey with the adolescent as co-researcher; part II includes all aspects related to our journey as co-researchers; and part III involves the time period after our journey as co-researchers. In part I, chapter 1, <b>I</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>you</b> to my way of speaking (i. e. narrative language), grounded in my way of seeing (i. e. social constructionist paradigm). In chapter 2, I shared with you my own narrative in making sense of HIV through personal reflective journal entries. By doing so, I acknowledge that I, researcher and therapist also tell stories about HIV through my statements, questions and everyday actions and interactions. In chapter 3, I reviewed academic literature in an attempt to research how adolescent HIV is "authored" (narrated) to the public by various academic discourses. In chapter 4, I reviewed narrative research studies of illness stories, relevant to adolescent HIV. Hereafter I stated my research question, justification, aim, and objectives. In chapter 5, I provide an overview of the research process, as was undertaken for the purpose this journey. In part II, <b>I</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>you</b> to "Gabby" (pseudonym), my co-researcher and co-author of this narrative report. Gabby regularly received ART at the paediatric out-patient unit at Kalafong Tertiary Provincial Hospital at the time of our interaction. In chapter 6, I describe the project phase (chapter 6), alongside Gabby's participation. The project phase was situated within a narrative social constructionist frame. It consisted of two sub-phases as a means to transform the therapeutic context to one of therapeutic co-research. The first sub-phase stretched over the course of 3 months as Gabby participated in the Collaborative Storybook Development (CSD) project. The CSD project was based on the narrative therapeutic work of Freedman and Combs (1996) on story construction and development. Each session was video recorded for the purpose of co-reflective discussion during the second sub-phase. Focussed co-reflection sessions formed the second sub-phase, which took place once a week and stretched across an additional 1 month period. The aim of this sub-phase was to collaboratively review how storytelling was employed to make sense of HIV throughout the CSD project. Over the course of four months, the project phase allowed for in-depth co-research into the meaning of HIV. Part III documents the time period following our journey as co-researchers. Chapter 7 is a reintegration (telling) of the new knowledge and practical wisdom constructed during the project phase. Such "telling" is done {{in the form of a}} storybook. Chapter 8 sheds some light on the narrative practice of reincorporation (sharing). This involved the sharing of new knowledge with audiences outside of the co-research dyad. In chapter 9, I discussed the ethical considerations undertaken in this research. This is followed by a discussion on the shortcomings and limitations of this journey. Based on the practical wisdom gained from this journey, recommendations are made for future endeavours. Mini Dissertation (MA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017. PsychologyMAUnrestricte...|$|E
40|$|One {{important}} contribution from science to environmental negotiations is {{the provision of}} scientific models, methods and concepts that may serve as decision-making tools and that hence may assist policy-makers in developing adequate solutions to environmental problems. In the context of climate change, the Global Warming Potential index has served {{a significant role in}} the process of making climate change negotiable. The Global Warming Potential index, which is a methodology for comparing the climate effect of a set of greenhouse gases and for transforming their emissions into a common measure, currently constitutes the foundation for implementation mechanisms adopted in the Kyoto Protocol, such as emissions trading, joint implementation and the clean development mechanism. The topic of this trial lecture is the development of the Global Warming Potential index, the GWP index, and the political role of this methodology in the development of the climate regime. The history of the GWP index, the political context within which this methodology was first introduced and the political role this methodology has acquired is an interesting case of science–policy interaction which is illustrative of the mechanisms at work in such processes and the possible implications they may have both for the scientific and the political process. After an introductory note, in which <b>I</b> <b>introduce</b> <b>you</b> to some of the essential characteristics of the problem of a human induced climate change and the political conditions that led to a strong political demand for the GWP methodology, I will discuss the more general notion of solution design models in negotiations, and requirements to their adequacy. In the third part of the presentation I will discuss the GWP index in more detail, and focus particularly on some of the more problematic aspects and shortcomings associated with this methodology. In the fourth part of the lecture, I will return to the political process on climate change, and discuss some implications for the adequacy of the solution design model adopted in the climate regime. In the last and final part of the lecture, then, I will draw some conclusions from this discussion. The lecture is based on previous and current research at my own institute, CICERO, and secondary literature, in particular work by Simon Shackley and Brian Wynne as well as Steven Smith and Tom Wigley...|$|E
