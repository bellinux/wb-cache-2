Because of this, Tokelau has a limited <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>personality.</b> In regards to international treaties, ratification is done by the New Zealand Government who extends their authority to include Tokelau by an express statement once the Government of Tokelau has been consulted. If Tokelau were to become a state in free association with New Zealand, then they would have the capacity to ratify treaties under their own name. There have been two referenda attempts in Tokelau to move to self-government. These occurred in 2006 and in 2007, however there was not enough required support for Tokelau to change its status.|$|E

2500|$|For a {{third group}} of authors, the <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> of the Holy See is based mostly, but not only, on its unique spiritual role.

This is an incomplete understanding, however, of the grounds on which its claim as a subject of international law can be justified", since, in his view, the Holy See’s claim to international personality can also be justified [...] {{by the fact that it}} is recognized by other states as a full subject of international law. The Lateran Treaty itself seems to support this view. In article 2, Italy recognized [...] "the sovereignty of the Holy See in the international domain as an attribute inherent in its nature, in accordance with its tradition and with the requirements of its mission in the world." ...|$|E

40|$|From the {{perspective}} of public <b>international</b> law, the <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> of the European Union (EU) carries with it the possibility for it to exercise rights and to bear obligations on the international plane.

In this chapter, two regimes are compared: the EU’s rights and obligations as an international organisation {{and the possibility that}} its internal structures might be recognised on the international plane, thus leading to more complex notions of subsidiary responsibility, shared between the various levels of European governance. <b>LEGAL</b> <b>PERSONALITY</b> MAY be primarily a technical question, {{but in the case of}} the EU, it represents a claim to a coherent identity on the international plane; with respect to third states, it represents a willingness to assume responsibility.

40|$|Imperfect Personality in Commercial Law Robert Pelikán Abstract In {{the theory}} of law, <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> (the terms "legal person" and "legal personality" are used in this text in their {{continental}} sense, i. e. describing both non-human and human entities and their legal capacity) is usually seen as a simple quality having only values, true or false. The existing theories of <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> were, therefore, trying to find such characteristics of <b>legal</b> <b>personality,</b> which will fully describe all legal persons existing in practice. Such an effort had to fail or, more precisely, the process of search for such a common denominator had to result in the disappearance of all the key characteristics necessary for understanding of the phenomenon of <b>legal</b> <b>personality.</b> The exploration of <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> must hence begin with the finding that <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> is not a quality having only values - true or false - but rather a full scale of values from nil to a (rarely seen) full <b>legal</b> <b>personality,</b> moreover appearing in many dimensions. In order to duly explain the phenomenon, the theory must not search for a common denominator of existing persons, but describe the concept of full <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> and explain the consequences of imperfection of existing legal persons in any of such qualities.

40|$|The <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> (or capacity) is an {{attribute}} that can {{belong to the}} participators in international relations. It divides {{all the members of}} international society into two groups. First of them consists of entities, that enjoy the <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> - we describe them as subjects of international law. In this group belong states, intergovernmental organisations (so called IGOs) and a group of various other units, e. g. The Holy See or the Sovereign Order of Malta. The second group is composed from the entities without <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> under <b>international</b> law. Here we could find wide group of non-governmental organisations and strong supranational corporations. They may possess significant political power and heavily influence deciding of the states and intergovernmental organisations, they may have <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> under municipal law but they do not enjoy the <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> under the <b>international</b> public law. The <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> is defined as possessing rights and duties enforceable at law. It means, that the subject under international law can conclude agreements, can enter into diplomatic relations (enjoys so called right of legation), can submit claims and act before international court or judge, has right to enjoy immunities for itself and for its representatives, can become a member of international organisation or become a party of international convention and also has to hold the responsibility for own unlawful actions. International organisations, as a subject of international law, enjoy the <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> different from the personality of member states. There is no doubt about the <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> of European Communities. Every of the three charters founding the European Coal and Steal Community, European Community and Euroatom includes explicit provision, that the founded organisation enjoys <b>legal</b> <b>personality.</b> Looking at the Maastricht and as well at the Amsterdam treaty, we cannot find any smilar provision concerning the <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> of European Union. The issue of whether the Union has <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> is disputed. The prevailing view is been that it was not the will of the member states to give the Union <b>legal</b> <b>personality.</b> Expert opinion generally maintains that an international organisation such as the European Union doesn't have the <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> unless its founders confer such personality on it expressly. In contradistinction to the original treaties about Communities the member states in Maastricht treaty did not acknowledged the personality of Union. Article 24 and 38 of the Treaty of the European Union (added by the Treaty of Amsterdam) give the Council of the European Union the capacity to conclude international agreements. But this competence is strictly limited only on areas covered by the Common Foreign and Security Policy and Police and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters and only when it is necessary to implement those titles. The legal effects of such agreement apply only on member states individually and according to the terms and conditions laid down by national law. Regarding this provision the European Union must be seen as a Union of States without <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> of its own under international public or domestic law, which, when it takes action at international level, does so on the behalf of the member states on not on his own account. The question of <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> was comprehensively researched by the European Convention. There was created a working group on <b>legal</b> <b>personality.</b> The group examined the matter closely and for the purpose heard the views of a number of experts. In the final report that was brought into open in October 2002 the working group recommended conferring explicit <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> on the Union. The single <b>legal</b> <b>personality,</b> according to the opinion of working group, should replace the existing <b>legal</b> <b>personalities.</b> The question of <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> was one of the "simple" issues discussed by Convention. The working group on <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> has finished its search quite early (comparing with other working groups) and the final report was established on broad consensus. ...|$|R
5000|$|Gaining <b>{{international}}</b> <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> {{is often}} a goal of international actors. By gaining personality, they gain acknowledgment in the international legal community. The amount of personality that an international actor has depends entirely upon state recognition. Legal personality can determine the rights that actors have {{as well as their}} standings with courts. As personality is given by states, {{it stands to reason that}} international actors are only effective when states allow them to be. [...] Without the approval of states, other actors have no rights nor any true ability in the international arena. One question that critics of the effectiveness of legal personality ask is if “personality contains any inherent legal capacity to act?” Personality is a concept with many blurred areas but must be grasped to understand the effectiveness, or ineffectiveness, of international actors. Entities that are capable of being granted personality and thus being subjects of international law are those with the capacity to act within the international arena. Entities that are candidates for <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> include corporations, companies, sovereign states, international organizations, and individuals. These entities should have legal powers, the ability to effectively exercise their powers, and associations with states on a permanent basis.|$|E

50|$|Until the {{expansion}} of NGOs in the 20th century, legal personality was not given to non-state actors commonly, if ever. Once these entities became actors, they were not ordinarily given personality unless granted by the state in a legal statute or treaty. Typically international organizations, NGOs, and corporations were seen as groups of individuals and were viewed as recipients of international law, rather than actors on the international stage. However NGOs especially have increasingly begun to play important roles in international politics and policy making {{over the last several}} decades. It is not clear when NGOs truly began {{to play a role in}} international politics, but the first notice of groups influencing the international policy making occurred in 1826. In 1911, these groups began to grow and amass attention and in 1919 Dwight W. Morrow began using “NGO” as a term. By 1943 scholars of several disciplines were referring to these groups of influence as NGOs. After formal recognition by the UN, NGOs were able to truly interact in the international arena. Getting international personality has historically been an obstacle for NGOs. 1910 saw the first convention to grant legal personality, and in 1936 Charles Fenwick is quoted with saying that NGO representation “might be greatly effective in cutting across national lines.” In response to changes in world policies, the approaches taken to obtain and grant <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> have seen several changes. These changes have resulted in and will continue to result in variations and challenges to the sources of <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>personality</b> and the roles that other international actors play. States were the first to gain <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>personality,</b> followed by non-state actors (such as MNCs and NGOs) and individuals. The 1986 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organizations established the definition of an international organization. The definition excluded non governmental organizations and established the concept of legal personality.|$|E

If the Court is serious about its own claim that the Union constitutes an entity with distinct constitutional features, it should be prepared to translate this into a policy of deference towards external norms. Whereas the consequence of such a modern, liberal approach would amount to less "autonomy" for the EU and its <b>legal</b> order under <b>international</b> law, the European Union, as such, would become a more mature actor on the global stage and—in the mid to longer term—offer its Member States, citizens, natural and legal persons the opportunity to reap more benefits from its "openness" to the world...|$|R
