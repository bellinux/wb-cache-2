25|$|The {{band was}} heavily {{inspired}} by Metallica and Megadeth, since {{they started out}} by covering them, as well as Carcass, Death, hard rock, classical music, thrash metal. The Quo Vadis Demo and Forever... featured violin interludes and female operatic vocals, but by the band abandoned these for Day <b>into</b> <b>Night</b> as both those things had become prevalent in metal music, according to the band members. Day <b>into</b> <b>Night</b> was more aggressive and technical than the band's previous offerings, partially due to improved musicianship. Also, guitarist and vocalist Arie was taking guitar lessons from Alex Skolnick of Testament and as a result, he played a few solos on Day <b>into</b> <b>Night</b> and added a Testament influence to the band. One of Bart's biggest influences is Chuck Schuldiner, and Gene Hoglan's playing on Individual Thought Patterns and Sean Reinert's playing on Human are two of Yanic's biggest influences. The album Defiant Imagination features two songs written about Chuck which are also dedicated to him. For bass duties on Defiant Imagination, Bart had contacted Steve Di Giorgio who had played on Death's Individual Thought Patterns.|$|E
