5|$|Details on {{reversing}} warfarin {{are provided}} in clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians. For people with an <b>international</b> <b>normalized</b> <b>ratio</b> (INR) between 4.5 and 10.0, a small dose (about 1000 mcg = one milligram) of oral vitamin K is sufficient. When warfarin is being given and INR is in therapeutic range, simple discontinuation of the drug for five days is usually enough to reverse the effect and cause INR to drop below 1.5.|$|E
5|$|For acute {{cases in}} the leg, the ACCP {{recommended}} a parenteral anticoagulant (such as LMWH, fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin) {{for at least five}} days and a VKA, the oral anticoagulant, the same day. LMWH and fondaparinux are suggested over unfractionated heparin, but both are retained in those with compromised kidney function, unlike unfractionated heparin. The VKA is generally taken for a minimum of three months to maintain an <b>international</b> <b>normalized</b> <b>ratio</b> of 2.0–3.0, with 2.5 as the target.

Pharmacogenetics (PG) could improve dosing efficiency and safety, but clinical trials evidence is meager. Methods and Results—A Randomized and Clinical Effectiveness Trial Comparing Two Pharmacogenetic Algorithms and Standard Care for Individualizing Warfarin Dosing (CoumaGen-II) comprised 2 comparisons: (1) a blinded, randomized comparison of a modified 1 -step (PG- 1) with a 3 -step algorithm (PG- 2) (N 504), and (2) a clinical effectiveness comparison of PG guidance with use of either algorithm with standard dosing in a parallel control group (N 1866).

In this study, we compared the outcomes of 29 right liver and 16 left liver ALDLT of comparable graft weight to recipient estimated standard liver volume ratio (GW/ESLV, 36. 9 % and 36. 4 % respectively). All liver grafts contained the middle hepatic vein. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score and urgency for transplantation of both groups were similar.

Methods: Prospective follow-up data, including 82, 297 <b>international</b> <b>normalized</b> <b>ratios,</b> were collected for 1476 patients undergoing single valve replacement with the Medtronic Hall valve between 1979 and 1994, with follow-up {{to the end of}} 1998. After excluding 204 patients who either died within 30 days or had fewer than 10 <b>international</b> <b>normalized</b> <b>ratios</b> recorded beyond 30 days, there were 10, 203 patient years of follow-up for analysis. Anticoagulation variability was measured as the percentage of <b>international</b> <b>normalized</b> <b>ratios</b> outside a target range of 2. 0 to 4. 0 for each patient. Results: Linearized rates for late death rose progressively with increasing deciles of anticoagulation variability for both aortic and mitral valve replacement (2. 7 % and 3. 3 % per year, respectively, in deciles 1 and 2 up to 9. 5 % and 14. 6 % per year, respectively, in deciles 6 - 10; P <. 001). Survival at 15 years after aortic valve replacement was 59 % for low anticoagulation variability (deciles 1 and 2), 55 % for intermediate anticoagulation variability (decile 3), and 28 % for high anticoagulation variability (deciles 4 - 10); survivals at 15 years after mitral valve replacement were 56 %, 42 %, and 24 %, respectively (P <. 001 between low-intermediate anticoagulation variability and high anticoagulation variability for both aortic and mitral valve replacement). On multivariate analysis, significant predictors of reduced survival were anticoagulation variability per 20 % increase (hazard ratio, 1. 8), diabetes (hazard ratio, 1. 6), decade of age (hazard ratio, 1. 6), concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (hazard ratio, 1. 5), male sex (hazard ratio, 1. 4), hypertension (hazard ratio, 1. 4), New York Heart Association class III or IV (hazard ratio, 1. 3), and non-sinus rhythm (hazard ratio, 1. 2). Patients with low anticoagulation variability who were in sinus rhythm and did not have diabetes, coronary bypass grafting, or hypertension had survivals equal to those of the age- and sex-matched general population at 15 years. The incidence of valve-related deaths was significantly higher with high anticoagulation variability compared with the incidence with low-intermediate anticoagulation variability for both aortic (1. 4 % vs 0. 5 % per year, P <. 001) and mitral valve replacement (1. 5 % vs 0. 5 % per year, P <. 001). By means of univariate analysis, high anticoagulation variability was significantly associated with New York Heart Association class III or IV at 5 years postoperatively (P <. 001) and with age of greater than 60 years {{at the time of the}} operation (P =. 002).
