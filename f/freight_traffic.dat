5|$|Victoria {{does not}} have a {{dominant}} mining base as with other states, and has traditionally been more dependent on agriculture for rail <b>freight</b> <b>traffic.</b> By the 1990s road transport had captured most general <b>freight</b> <b>traffic,</b> with an average of only 6.1 million tonnes of intrastate freight carried each year between 1996 and 1998; containers being the major cargo, followed by cement, logs, quarry products and steel.|$|E
5|$|After a {{temporary}} closure between October 1951 and January 1952, British Railways (the {{successor to the}} LNER) ended passenger services between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace permanently on 3 July 1954. British Rail <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> continued {{to pass through the}} station until 1964. After <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> ceased, the line continued to be used for occasional London Underground rolling stock transfers between Highgate depot and the Northern City line, with the stock being pulled over the unelectrified lines by battery locomotives. This ceased in 1970 because of the poor condition of some of the intermediate bridges, and the track was lifted through the surface platforms in 1972.|$|E

5|$|The {{revenue of}} the line was at 533,306 kroner per year in 1900, most of which was from the <b>freight</b> <b>traffic.</b> This gave a return of capital of 1–2%. <b>Freight</b> <b>traffic</b> {{increased}} about {{twice as fast as}} passenger traffic, and in 1904 a new daily train was put into service to Storlien. The first Hell–Sunnan Line opened in stages between 1902 and 1905.

5|$|Before 1952, {{the inner}} German border could be crossed {{at almost any}} point along its length.

The number of crossing points was reduced to three air corridors, three road corridors, two railway lines and two river connections giving transit access to Berlin, plus a handful of additional crossing points for <b>freight</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Continued drought, road competition, and {{rationalisation}} of intrastate freight {{operations have}} seen this change in recent years, {{with an average of}} only 6.1 million tonnes of intrastate freight carried from each year between 1996 and 1998; and containers now being the major traffic, with residual cement, logs, quarry, and steel trains operating. By the 1990s road transport has captured most general <b>freight</b> <b>traffic,</b> with less than carload traffic was discontinued in July 2007 {{with the end of the}} Fastrack freight service. An exception to the decline is interstate operations, with intermodal container traffic growing due to competition between private operators.|$|E

50|$|Before {{the opening}} of the Ankara-Istanbul {{high-speed}} railway in 2009, the Istanbul-Ankara railway was the busiest line in Turkey as well as the primary inter-city route, connecting Istanbul with Ankara through five provincial capitals: Izmit, Arifiye (a suburb of Adapazarı), Bilecik, Bozüyük and Eskişehir. In 2008, 65% of all inter-city service used the railway entirely or at one point. The Haydarpaşa suburban and the Ankara suburban operated commuter service along the line in Istanbul and Ankara respectively. <b>Freight</b> rail <b>traffic</b> is heavy on the line as the railway connects to the Port of Haydarpaşa and the Port of Derince as well as other private ports and passes through several important industrial regions in Turkey.
