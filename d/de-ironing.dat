40|$|Iron {{overload}} {{is common}} in lemurs and some New World nonhuman primates raised in captivity, {{but there is no}} such documentation in the red bald-headed uakari (Cacajao calvus rubicundus). This study describes postmortem documentation of severe iron storage disease in one red bald-headed uakari and the use of iron chelation with oral deferasirox in the three surviving members of the colony. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify pretreatment iron burden and to follow the response to therapy in two females, 22 and 28 yr of age, and one male 33 yr of age. Baseline liver iron concentrations ranged from 16 to 23 mg/g dry weight. In humans, a liver iron concentration greater than 15 mg/g is considered severe and associated with endocrine and cardiac toxicity. The uakaris were otherwise asymptomatic, generally healthy, nonpregnant, and on a stable, low-iron diet. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging indicated that dosage escalations up to 100 mg/kg were needed to produce meaningful reductions in iron stores. After 5 yr of therapy, two animals continue at a dosage of 100 mg/kg per day, and the third was transitioned to twice-weekly maintenance dosing because of successful <b>de-ironing.</b> The animals tolerated iron chelation therapy well, having stable hematologic, renal, and hepatic function profiles before, during, and after treatment. Deferasirox monotherapy may represent a therapeutic option in primates with iron storage disease when dietary measures are ineffective and phlebotomy is logistically challenging...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The <b>de-ironing</b> {{of water}} is a basic stage in water-treating technology. Consequently, the {{oxidation}} of easily soluble Fe(II) to poorly soluble Fe(III) compounds is indispensible. In order to oxidize Fe(II) ions to Fe(III), a macromolecular and macroporous product in bead form was used: polystyrene cross-linked by divinylbenzene, which contains pendant N-chlorosulfonamide groups in both the sodium and hydrogen forms. To assist the process of removing residual iron from water, this polymer—a macromolecular analog of Chloramine T, containing more than 4. 0 mequiv of active chlorine/g—was prepared, starting from the sul-fonate cation exchanger Amberlyst 15 by a three-step transformation of its functional groups. The investigations were carried out using both the batchwise and column methods, and 0. 0025 M as well as 0. 02 M FeSO 4 solutions with different acidity were used. We found that the oxidation of ferrous ions to ferric by N-chlorosulfonamide copolymer was effective and was favored by a low pH. The oxidative ability of the copolymer was 225 mg Fe(II) /g. We established that the oxidation reaction could be operated in two directions. In acidic media (pH < 2. 5), Fe(III) ions remained in the solution as products of the reaction. The higher the pH, the more the poorly soluble ferric compounds sedimented in the inner structure of the copolymer beads. In this way, new hybrid materials were obtained, i. e., by ferrous/ferric ox-ides and hydroxides, by nanoparticles, modified materials which can serve as specific react-ing sorbents and catalysts...|$|E
40|$|Subcortical {{white matter}} (SWM) {{is a thin}} layer of white matter (WM) {{residing}} just below the cortex. Its structure, metabolism and function differ substantially from deep WM. Importantly, SWM incorporates short association fibers, the intra-hemispheric connections between adjacent gyri, referred to as U-fibers. Despite their importance for cortico-cortical connectivity {{little is known about the}} distribution of U-fibers in humans mainly due to the lack of appropriate imaging methods. SWM mapping by structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), came into reach only very recently by the availability of ultra high resolution MRI vivo required to image this ultra-thin, geometrically complex structure. No study has explored this potential so far and the underlying biophysical MR contrast mechanisms in SWM are still unclear. Herein, we investigate multiple MR contrasts in human SWM with high-resolution in-vivo 7 T MRI. We demonstrate that the transverse relaxation rate (R 2), effective transverse relaxation rate (R 2) * and magnetic susceptibility are increased in SWM exhibiting strong contrast to both adjacent grey matter (GM) and deep WM. Combination of increased R 2 * and increased susceptibility points toward an elevated levels of paramagnetic iron as a driving contrast mechanism. This hypothesis was tested in a post-mortem human brain sample with 7 T MRI, classical histology and quantitative iron and myelin mapping. Quantitative iron maps were obtained at scales ranging from 1 to 100 μm by proton induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopic Imaging (LA ICP MSI). Elevated iron level in oligodendrocytes and iron-rich fibers in SWM was confirmed as the dominant contrast mechanism. In addition, we showed that SWM contrast in MRI vanished after <b>de-ironing</b> the brain tissue sample in deferroxamine solution. We therefore conclude that the SWM appearance in MR images is solely driven by elevated iron concentration. Furthermore, using a novel SWM segmentation method we demonstrated that SWM contrast is not uniform across the brain. U-fiber-rich frontal, temporal and parietal association areas showed higher SWM contrast, while primary motor, sensory and auditory areas with high intracortical myelination showed lower SWM contrast. This suggests that iron accumulation in SWM is area-dependent and might reflect U-fiber density and distinct myelination patterns of overlying cortical areas. These new findings are of paramount importance and may pave the way for future in-vivo segmentation strategies for this crucial white matter structure and for potential non-invasive U-fiber density mapping in humans...|$|E
40|$|Myelin {{and iron}} {{are the major}} source of MR {{contrast}} in the brain. Iron dominates R 2 *, R 2 and QSM in the cortex as well as in subcortical areas and contributes to white matter contrast. To exploit this contrast for cortical parcellation, myeloarchitecture mapping, or iron quantification, significant theoretical and experimental efforts were devoted to the understanding of iron-induced contrast. However, the impact of the cellular and subcellular iron distribution is not well understood. Frequently, it is described by a simple linear dependence of the MRI contrast parameters on iron concentration, largely disregarding the inhomogeneous distribution of iron in the brain. A major reason for this simplification is a lack of quantitative knowledge on the cellular iron distribution. Moreover, the interplay between the microscopic iron distribution and diffusion in creating MR contrast in static de-phasing, motional narrowing or intermediate regime is not fully understood. We set out to address this lack in knowledge and modelling by combining state of the art quantitative 7 T MRI with cutting-edge quantitative iron and myelin mapping on post mortem brain samples. Quantitative R 2 *, R 2, R 1 and QSM maps were obtained for the human cortex, the subcortical and the deep white matter as well as for brain nuclei before and after <b>de-ironing.</b> Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopic Imaging (LA ICP MSI) yielded quantitative iron maps with a mesoscopic resolution of 60 x 120 μm. Proton Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) provided quantitative iron maps with a cellular resolution down to 1 μm. MSI and PIXE demonstrated the inhomogenous distribution of iron in both grey and white matter at different spatial scales. In grey matter iron rich fibers, and small (1 - 3 μm) micro-, astro- and oligodendroglia contained most of the iron and were sparsely distributed. In superficial and deep white matter, however, oligodendrocytes somas with the sizes of 5 ± 1. 5 μm (distance between cells of 20 ± 5 μm) and iron rich fibers contained most of the iron. In addition, patches of enhanced iron concentration around small vessels with a typical size of 100 - 200 μm contribute to up to 20 % of R 2 * and QSM and their orientation dependence in white matter. A different contrast mechanism prevailed in brain nuclei where densely packed 20 μm large iron loaded neurons dominated the MR contrast. These results provide an important basis for understanding the iron induced MR-contrast and its microstructural underpinnings. Based on these measured microscopic iron distributions and a Gaussian diffusion model we are {{now in the process of}} simulating the MR contrast mechanisms in different tissue types...|$|E
40|$|The incidences {{of obesity}} and type 2 {{diabetes}} are reaching epidemic proportions worldwide. A cardinal feature of these conditions is resistance {{to the effects of}} the hormone insulin and a resulting hepatic overproduction of glucose. Insulin resistance is also implicated in a range of liver diseases including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatitis C infection. Insulin is released after a meal and acts on liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue to reduce blood glucose concentration. In the liver, insulin inhibits the production and release of glucose into the circulation and stimulates its storage as glycogen. Glucagon, on the other hand, is present in the fasting state and causes breakdown of hepatic glycogen along with production of new glucose. This glucose is released from hepatocytes into the circulation. For the studies in this thesis, functional assays to measure various aspects of hepatic glucose metabolism in vitro were developed. This included measuring glucose output into culture medium, hepatocyte uptake of radiolabelled glucose and incorporation into glycogen, and total cellular glycogen content. These assays were used to investigate glucose metabolism in primary rat hepatocytes and FaO rat hepatoma cells. Both cell types responded to physiological concentrations of insulin, showing decreased glucose output and increased glycogen synthesis. Glucagon increased glucose output and reduced glycogen synthesis in primary cells but had no effect on FaO cells. Factors that have been identified that may inhibit or potentiate insulin action were investigated. Increased body iron stores have been linked with insulin resistance. <b>De-ironing</b> patients improves insulin sensitivity, suggesting a causal relationship between iron and insulin resistance. Hepatocytes store the majority of the body’s excess iron. This project investigated the effects of increasing hepatocyte iron stores, through addition of ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), or depleting iron stores by chelation with dipyridyl. Small increases or decreases of iron in primary cells had negative effects on cell viability, resulting in significantly reduced glucose output and glycogen synthesis. Dipyridyl treatment had similar effects on FaO cells as on primary cells but FAC treatment increased FaO glucose output, although significant iron loading was not achieved. With concentrations of FAC and dipyridyl low enough to not significantly influence cell viability, insulin sensitivity was not affected. Adiponectin is an insulin sensitiser and appears to exert this effect primarily through the liver. Adiponectin can also reduce hepatic glucose output (HGO) independent of insulin. It is believed adiponectin mediates its effects in liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In muscle, p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p 38 MAPK) has been implicated as a downstream component of adiponectin signalling. In this study, recombinant human adiponectin was produced and collected in culture medium which was then concentrated. Despite the presence of both high molecular weight (HMW) and low molecular weight (LMW) adiponectin multimers, the concentrated medium had no effect on HGO in {{the presence or absence of}} insulin. Concentrated adiponectin medium did not affect AMPK or p 38 MAPK phosphorylation in hepatocytes or other cell types previously shown to respond to adiponectin. However, commercially-sourced purified recombinant adiponectin also failed to elicit any observable responses. AICAR and metformin are pharmacological activators of AMPK and were used to treat primary rat hepatocytes and FaO cells. These treatments reduced HGO independent of insulin in both cell types. In primary cells, these reductions were partially inhibited with Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, suggesting that both AICAR and metformin action is at least partly AMPK dependent. In FaO cells, Compound C only inhibited the AICAR-mediated reduction of glucose output, indicating that metformin may act independently of AMPK in these cells. Compound C significantly inhibited AICAR and metformin-mediated increases in AMPK phosphorylation in primary hepatocytes and FaO cells. There was a trend towards inhibition of AICAR-mediated p 38 MAPK phosphorylation with Compound C treatment, suggesting that p 38 MAPK may lie downstream of AMPK in hepatocytes. Adenoviral expression of constitutively active (CA) and dominant negative (DN) AMPK in primary rat hepatocytes was used to further study the role of AMPK in hepatic glucose metabolism. Despite significant expression of CA AMPK, phosphorylation of downstream acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) was not affected nor was HGO. CA AMPK did, however, increase phosphorylation of p 38 MAPK. DN AMPK completely inhibited AICAR-mediated AMPK phosphorylation and partially inhibited phosphorylation of ACC. In addition, AICAR-mediated phosphorylation of p 38 MAPK was inhibited by DN AMPK. Taken together, these results suggest that p 38 MAPK is downstream of AMPK in hepatocytes. The implication that p 38 MAPK is involved in hepatic AMPK signalling is a novel finding. A greater understanding of this pathway in the liver may identify novel therapeutic targets, leading to improved treatment strategies for metabolic disorders linked to obesity and {{type 2 diabetes}}...|$|E
