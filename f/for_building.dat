5|$|The {{traffic routing}} {{was not only}} {{influenced}} by {{the location of the}} already existing stations the line was supposed to connect, but also by land availability in the city centre. One of the original drafts, which called <b>for</b> <b>building</b> the line along Leipziger Straße, had to be scrapped because of overly high land prices. The moat of the 17th century Berlin Fortress was filled up between Hackescher Markt and Jannowitzbrücke stations and, since it was public land, was used <b>for</b> <b>building</b> the railway line. This explains some of the curvy sections on the Stadtbahn, especially between Alexanderplatz and Jannowitzbrücke stations.|$|E

5|$|A red-painted {{house for}} the {{signalman}} was put up close to the station. Tryvandsbanen also developed plans <b>for</b> <b>building</b> a station house with a waiting shed, but these never materialised. The name of the red-painted house was changed from Nordpolen ("The North Pole") to Norden ("The North") and it was modernised after {{the removal of the}} tracks. The station was included on the Nordmarka maps published in 1913 and 1938.|$|E
5|$|Access {{routes to}} the estate were also added to and enhanced; there were three {{driveways}} giving approaches from the North Downs, Dorking and from the railway at the west.

New products based on OpenStep were released, including OpenStep Enterprise, a version for Microsoft's Windows NT.

5|$|As {{his works}} have sold since the 2010s, Invader adopted a new {{strategy}} to avoid them being removed. In late 2015, Invader planned a series of art pieces in New York City, putting out a call on social media <b>for</b> <b>building</b> owners who {{would be willing to}} host his mosaics legally. In addition, he has chosen sites with architectural features restricting access. Also, his works may be larger and use more delicate tiles so that they cannot be removed undamaged.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, Swiss {{authorities}} {{considered the}} construction of a Swiss nuclear bomb. Leading nuclear physicists at the Federal Institute of Technology Zürich such as Paul Scherrer made this a realistic possibility. In 1988, the Paul Scherrer Institute was founded in his name to explore the therapeutic uses of neutron scattering technologies. Financial problems with the defence budget and ethical considerations prevented the substantial funds from being allocated, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 was seen as a valid alternative. All remaining plans <b>for</b> <b>building</b> nuclear weapons were dropped by 1988.|$|E

40|$|A {{complete}} {{review on}} scale model testing <b>for</b> <b>buildings,</b> considering {{a wide range}} of methodologies and new manufacturing techniques, in areas such as statics and dynamics, acoustics, lighting, aerodynamics and thermodynamics for energy efficiency is presented. On the one hand, scale model testing <b>for</b> <b>buildings</b> require different considerations and techniques and are usually focused on one specific physical field contributing to the information scattering. On the other hand, they are sometimes too general, theoretical or unpractical. Although commercial computer simulations are first option among professionals, they necessarily simplify complex phenomena and ignore, among other aspects, size effects and latest findings in fractals. The potential of complementary experiments using new manufactured scale models <b>for</b> <b>buildings</b> is raising, however, it is still missing a practical overview through different physical fields specifically <b>for</b> <b>buildings</b> with these considerations. This review gives a wide perspective and unified scope on uses and possibilities of scale model testing <b>for</b> <b>buildings,</b> from the traditional configurations of Leon Battiste Alberti to new possibilities applying complex physics and new techniques of 3 D-modelling...|$|R
