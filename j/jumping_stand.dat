5000|$|Emil Menzel {{was a very}} {{productive}} scholar, {{but he was not}} motivated by amassing more publications. He {{remains one of the most}} highly respected researchers in primatology, but he seemed unconcerned about establishing a legacy associated with his name. Indeed, one quote from Emil's writings took a playful jab at the tendency to name apparatus and paradigms after the scientist who developed or popularized them: [...] "In the hope that I can make field work scientifically respectable, I have considered patenting the tree as the Menzel <b>Jumping</b> <b>Stand,</b> the river as the Tulane Obstruction Apparatus, and the jungle as the Delta Primate Center General Test Apparatus" [...] (p. 80,). Rather, he was motivated by the data, and by the scholarly pursuit of knowledge about species in which he found fascination.|$|E
40|$|The {{mouse lemur}} (Microcebus murinus) is a {{promising}} primate model for investigating normal and pathological cerebral aging. The locomotor behavior of this arboreal primate {{is characterized by}} jumps to and from trunks and branches. Many reports indicate insufficient adaptation of the mouse lemur to experimental devices used to evaluate its cognition, which is an impediment to the efficient use of this animal in research. In order to develop cognitive testing methods appropriate to the behavioral and biological traits of this species, we adapted the Lashley <b>jumping</b> <b>stand</b> apparatus, initially designed for rats, to the mouse lemur. We used this <b>jumping</b> <b>stand</b> apparatus to compare performances of young (n = 12) and aged (n = 8) adults in acquisition and long-term retention of visual discriminations. All mouse lemurs completed the tasks and only 25 trials, on average, were needed to master the first discrimination problem with no age-related differences. A month later, all mouse lemurs made progress for acquiring the second discrimination problem but only the young group reached immediately the criterion in the retention test of the first discrimination problem. This study shows that the <b>jumping</b> <b>stand</b> apparatus allows rapid and efficient evaluation of cognition in mouse lemurs and demonstrates {{that about half of}} the old mouse lemurs display a specific deficit in long-term retention but not in acquisition of visual discrimination...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of dynamic}} depth cues in {{distance}} estimation {{was investigated in}} the Mongolian gerbil. Animals were trained to jump randomly varied distances on a <b>jumping</b> <b>stand</b> under both binocular and monocular conditions. Videotape analysis revealed that prior to jumping, the gerbils executed a series of vertical head movements, the amplitude and velocity of which {{were related to the}} gap distance and to each animal's accuracy. This suggested that the gerbils were employing motion parallax cues to judge distance. An inverse relation between the magnitude of forward movement and the frequency of vertical head movements suggested that loom cues were also being used to judge distance. This hypothesis received support from a second experiment in which forward movements were constrained by a short take-off platform. In this condition, frequency of vertical head movements increased, suggesting that a compensation had occurred for the loss of information from loom...|$|E

40|$|Experiment 1 has {{examined}} the effect of overtraining on shift learning in a simultaneous matching- (or nonmatching-) to-sample discrimination. Experiment 2 {{has examined}} how much overtraining is required for rats to form the concept of matching in a matchingto- sample discrimination. In Experiment 1, rats were overtrained on a simultaneous matching-to-sample discrimination or nonmatching-to-sample discrimination in a discrete threestimulus- presentation T-type <b>jumping</b> <b>stand</b> and were transferred to either a nonshifted (nonshift) or a shifted task (shift). Group Nonshift learned their subsequent shift task more rapidly than Group Shift, regardless of whether rats were tested on the matching-to-sample task or the nonmatching-to-sample one (symmetry of transfer effect). Experiment 2 shows that the apparent asymmetry of transfer effect is observed at reaching criterion (OT-O), whereas the symmetry of transfer effect is observed after 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, and 20 days of overtraining. These results indicate that overtraining is an obvious operational precondition for symmetry of transfer effect in matching- (or nonmatching-) to-sample discrimination in rats...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effects of brain x-radiation on the establishment of and recovery from abnormal behavior symptoms. The design was such as to also yield data showing the effects of radiation on simple discrimination learning. Forty-two albino rats were used in this study. The experimental rats received 5, 000 roentgens of x-radiation to the brain and the control rates were sham-radiated. Following a period of preliminary adaptation to a modified Lashley <b>jumping</b> <b>stand,</b> the rats were trained in simple discrimination learning. The establishment of abnormal behavior was begun immediately after the rats reached the experimental criterion of 20 consecutive correct responses was initiated after the rats met the criterion of abnormal fixation responses. The rats were given 3 different types of recovery training. Analysis of {{the results of this study}} showed that the radiated group showed neither greater susceptibility to the establishment of abnormal behavior nor quicker recovery from such behavior than the control group. Although qualitative observations indicated some differences between the groups, an adequate treatment of these qualitative observations remains to be made. Advisor: William J. Arnol...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPresenting the {{two eyes}} with incongruent stimuli {{leads to the}} {{phenomenon}} of interocular rivalry. At any given time, one of the stimuli is perceptually suppressed {{in order to avoid}} double vision. In squinting subjects, rivalry occurs permanently also for congruent stimuli because of developmental rearrangement of cortical circuitry. In this study, we have investigated the dynamics and stimulus dependence of rivalry in six esotropic, four exotropic and three non-strabismic cats. As an indicator for perception, we used optokinetic nystagmus that was induced by moving gratings. The esotropic cats were tested for their visual acuity by means of a <b>jumping</b> <b>stand</b> procedure. The results show that one eye can dominate perception even if both eyes have equal visual acuity and are presented with stimuli of equal contrast. Strong eye dominance asymmetry was found in {{all but one of the}} tested cats. Notably, all three of the normal cats showed a clear asymmetry in perceptual selection. Measurements with varying contrast and velocity of the stimuli revealed that the influence of these parameters on perceptual selection was independent of the presence of strabismus. In all cats, the time during which a given eye dominated perception increased with the contrast and decreases with the velocity of the stimulus presented to this eye...|$|E
