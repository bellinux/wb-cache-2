5000|$|The beam {{divergence}} of an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>beam</b> is an angular {{measure of the}} increase in beam diameter or radius with distance from the optical aperture or antenna aperture from which the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>beam</b> emerges. The term is relevant only in the [...] "far field", away from any focus of the beam. Practically speaking, however, the far field can commence physically close to the radiating aperture, depending on aperture diameter and the operating wavelength.|$|E

40|$|It was {{recently}} shown that so-called coherence vortices, singularities of the two-point correlation function, generally occur in partially coherent <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>beams.</b> We study the three-dimensional structure of these singularities {{and show that}} in successive cross sections of a beam a rich variety of topological reactions takes place. These reactions involve, apart from vortices, the creation or annihilation of dipoles, saddles, maxima and minima of the phase of the correlation function. Since these reactions happen generically, i. e., under quite general conditions, these observations have implications for interference experiments with partially coherent, <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>beams.</b> © 2013 Optical Society of America...|$|R
50|$|Beam {{diameter}} {{is usually}} used to characterize <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>beams</b> in the optical regime, and occasionally {{in the microwave}} regime, that is, {{cases in which the}} aperture from which the beam emerges is very large with respect to the wavelength.|$|R
50|$|The beam {{diameter}} or beam width of an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>beam</b> is the diameter along any specified line that is {{perpendicular to the}} beam axis and intersects it. Since beams typically do not have sharp edges, the diameter can be defined in many different ways. Five definitions of the beam width are in common use: D4σ, 10/90 or 20/80 knife-edge, 1/e2, FWHM, and D86. The beam width {{can be measured in}} units of length at a particular plane perpendicular to the beam axis, but it can also refer to the angular width, which is the angle subtended by the beam at the source. The angular width is also called the beam divergence.|$|E
5000|$|In rotation-powered pulsars, {{the beam}} {{originates}} from the rotational {{energy of the}} neutron star, which generates an electrical field from {{the movement of the}} very strong magnetic field, resulting in the acceleration of protons and electrons on the star surface and the creation of an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>beam</b> emanating from the poles of the magnetic field. This rotation slows down over time as electromagnetic power is emitted. When a pulsar's spin period slows down sufficiently, the radio pulsar mechanism is believed to turn off (the so-called [...] "death line"). This turn-off seems to take place after about 10-100 million years, which means of all the neutron stars born in the 13.6 billion year age of the universe, around 99% no longer pulsate.|$|E
5000|$|Clarence [...] "Max" [...] Fowler {{began work}} for the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1952, {{retiring}} in 1996. During this period Fowler became the highest Western authority on the research and application of explosively pumped flux compression generators. (The research of the Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov at Sarov was more advanced, but {{for a long time}} the whole field of megagauss research was covered by military secrecy). In those years, mega-gauss technologies were being applied {{for the first time in}} a series of experimental devices, such as lasers, implosion foils, <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>beam</b> accelerators and the railgun. Fowler also used these generators in order to study the response of several substances to ultra-strong magnetic fields, and among the materials that were investigated were superconductors that operated at the temperature of liquid nitrogen (such as the Yttrium barium copper oxide compound).|$|E
40|$|For an <b>electromagnetic</b> {{stochastic}} <b>beam,</b> {{the choice}} of the mathematical structure of the cross-spectral density matrix is limited by the constraint of non-negative definiteness.

5000|$|The {{events leading}} to the {{formation}} of a pulsar begin when the core of a massive star is compressed during a supernova, which collapses into a neutron star. The neutron star retains most of its angular momentum, and since it has {{only a tiny fraction of}} its progenitor's radius (and therefore its moment of inertia is sharply reduced), it is formed with very high rotation speed. A beam of radiation is emitted along the magnetic axis of the pulsar, which spins along with the rotation of the neutron star. The magnetic axis of the pulsar determines the direction of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>beam,</b> with the magnetic axis not necessarily being the same as its rotational axis. This misalignment causes the beam to be seen once for every rotation of the neutron star, which leads to the [...] "pulsed" [...] nature of its appearance.|$|E
