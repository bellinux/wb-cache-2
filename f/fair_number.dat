A <b>fair</b> <b>number</b> were printed and sold, however, and far more copies of the Lives circulated than of Shelley's novels. Some of the volumes were illegally copied in the United States, where they were praised by the poet and critic Edgar Allan Poe. Not reprinted until 2002, Mary Shelley's biographies have until recently received little academic appreciation.|$|E
5|$|Silkies lay a <b>fair</b> <b>number</b> of eggs, of a cream color, but {{production}} is often interrupted {{due to their}} extreme tendency to go broody; a hen will produce 100 eggs in an ideal year. Their capacity for incubation, which has been selectively bred out of most fowl bred especially for egg production, is often exploited by poultry keepers by allowing Silkies to raise the offspring of other birds. In addition to being good mothers, Silkies are universally renowned for their calm, friendly temperament. They do well in confinement, and interact very well with children. This docility can cause Silkies to be bullied by more active or aggressive birds when kept in mixed flocks.|$|E
5|$|After his {{military}} service, he founded a firm with Eldar Sharon (until 1964) and Alfred Neumann (until 1966). The physical {{and economic conditions}} in Israel at the time, allowed them to complete a <b>fair</b> <b>number</b> of works in a relatively brief period of time, which brought international attention. Their joint works include the Mediterranean Sea Club in Achzib (1960–1961), Dubiner House (1963), the Chaim Laskov Officer Training School (1963–1967) Bahad 1, the main officer training school of the Israel Defense Forces, just later the synagogue (1969–1971) at the same academy, and the Bat Yam city hall (1963–1969). Their designs shared aspects {{in common with the}} metabolist movement, borrowing metaphoric shapes from nature for use in planning morphological structures. The modularity of these works, such as the Dubiner House, provided an architectural precedent for the Habitat 67 project by Moshe Safdie.|$|E

25|$|Globally, {{the term}} salsa has eclipsed the {{original}} {{names of the}} various Cuban musical genres it encompasses. Ironically, Cuban-based music was promoted more effectively worldwide in the 1970s and 1980s by the salsa industry, than by Cuba.

50|$|The Rio San Rodrigo is {{the largest}} river {{originating}} in the Sierra del Burro. The drainage from the Sierra is to the Rio Grande. The Sierra {{is located in the}} Chihuahua Desert, and most of the vegetation is arid or semi-arid desert scrub, including chaparral and Tamaulipan matorral. Oak forests are found, mostly at elevations of more than 4900 ft. Among the fauna are the American black bear, an endangered species in Mexico, except for the Sierra del Burro where it is still found in <b>fair</b> <b>numbers,</b> but considered at risk. Beaver are also found in the Sierra. Due to its proximity the flora and fauna have similarities to that of the Big Bend region of Texas.|$|R

A series of low waterfalls occur at Cunnighamhead on the Annick Water, these being, like many others, dykes that are more {{resistant}} to erosion than the surrounding rocks. Other notable waterfalls are on the Polbaith burn, Fenwick Water (near Rigghill), Glen water (Darvel) and Burn Anne.|$|E

The consonant g is written with گ, and ẓ is either written with زٜ (zāy with dot below) or not distinguished from z. Word separations are mostly disjunctive.|$|E

Sand grouse are spotted near small ponds or lakes. The endangered great Indian bustard is a magnificent bird found in relatively <b>fair</b> <b>numbers.</b> It migrates locally in different seasons.
