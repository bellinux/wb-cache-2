25|$|Focusing on the exaggerated indemnity, Twain said:To Dr. Smith the “thirteen-fold-extra” clearly {{stood for}} “theft and extortion,” {{and he was}} right, {{distinctly}} right, indisputably right.

If a pauper owes me a dollar and I catch him unprotected and make him pay me fourteen dollars thirteen of it is “theft and extortion.” If I make him pay only one dollar thirty-three and a third cents the thirty-three and a third cents are “theft and extortion,” just the same.|$|E

[...] Parsons was unable to present evidence to corroborate his claim of a sexual advance by Ernest. Ernest's family and friends stated in court that Ernest was not gay or bisexual. Prosecution witnesses testified of Parsons' homosexual activity in jail. According to forensic psychiatrist David Tomb from the University of Utah, the descriptions of Parsons' sexual history indicated that he [...] "may have been the one initiating the contact and became angry when [...] turned him down." [...] A medical examiner testified that Ernest appeared to have been stabbed while sleeping and was unable to defend himself.

500|$|The {{first act}} was {{completed}} by March 1890; {{the rest of the}} opera was not composed in chronological order, as had been Verdi's usual practice. The musicologist Roger Parker comments that this piecemeal approach may have been [...] "an indication of the relative independence of individual scenes". Progress was slow, with composition [...] "carried out in short bursts of activity interspersed with long fallow periods" [...] partly caused by the composer's depression. Verdi was weighed down by the fear of being unable to complete the score, and also by the deaths and impending deaths of close friends, including the conductors Franco Faccio and Emanuele Muzio. There was no pressure on the composer to hurry. As he observed at the time, he was not working on a commission from a particular opera house, as he had in the past, but was composing for his own pleasure: [...] "in writing Falstaff, I haven't thought about either theatres or singers". He reiterated this idea in December 1890, a time when his spirits were very low after Muzio's death that November: [...] "Will I finish it ? Or will I not finish it? Who <b>knows!</b> <b>I</b> am writing without any aim, without a goal, just to pass a few hours of the day". By early 1891 he was declaring that he could not finish the work that year, but in May he expressed some small optimism, which by mid-June, had turned into: ...|$|E
500|$|So many Southern Rhodesians were {{withdrawn}} from the trenches for officer training that in mid-1915 Brady appealed through the Salisbury and Bulawayo presses for more volunteers to replace {{those who had been}} commissioned. A platoon of Southern Rhodesians with the 2nd Battalion, KRRC took part in the [...] "big push" [...] of 1 July 1916, {{the first day of the}} Battle of the Somme, charging German positions elsewhere on the line early that morning. There were 90 Rhodesians on the eve of the attack and only 10 alive and unwounded afterwards. On the Somme battlefield itself, Rhodesians were among those at Delville Wood, which began on 14 July. This was the South African 1st Infantry Brigade's first engagement, and some of the colonials blacked up and imitated Zulu battle cries and war dances. Despite suffering casualties of catastrophic proportions—about 80% of the brigade's personnel were killed, wounded or captured—they took the Wood and held it as ordered until they were relieved on 20 July. By the time of its withdrawal, the South African Brigade, originally numbering 3,155 (123 officers and 3,032 other ranks), had been reduced to 19 officers and 600 men. Delville Wood was later described by Sir BH Liddell Hart as [...] "the bloodiest battle hell of 1916". [...] "God <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> never wish to see such horrible sights again," [...] a Southern Rhodesian veteran of the battle wrote home; [...] "at times I wished it would come fast, anything to get out of that terrible death-trap and murderous place." ...|$|E
500|$|The next month, Humphrey's rival Robert Kennedy {{was assassinated}} in Los Angeles, {{prompting}} the Vice-President {{to return to his}} home in Minnesota and [...] "think about the next stage." [...] Shaken by the event, Humphrey took off two weeks from campaigning. He met with President Johnson, and the two talked about [...] "everything" [...] during a three-hour meeting. The assassination all but guaranteed Humphrey the nomination. He commented that he [...] "was doing everything I could to win the nomination...but God <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> didn't want it that way." [...] A large number of Kennedy delegates switched to Humphrey, but he lost money from Republican donors concerned about a Kennedy nomination, and popular opinion polls shifted in favor of Senator McCarthy. In fact, Humphrey was booed before 50,000 people on June 24 at the Lincoln Memorial as he was introduced at a Solidarity March for civil rights. Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson described the response as ironic, given that Humphrey was booed at the 1948 Democratic National Convention after advocating a civil rights plank. He tried to defend his record against the liberal detractors, but often encountered anti-war protesters and hostile crowds while campaigning. At the end of June, Republican Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon assessed the race, arguing that Humphrey would be the party's nominee for president but criticized him for being too closely aligned with Johnson's policies. Humphrey asked for Johnson's permission to deviate from the administration's position on the war for a plan that included a bombing halt and drawback of forces, but Johnson refused, explaining that it would disrupt the peace process and endanger American soldiers. He relayed to Humphrey that the blood of his son-in-law who was serving in Vietnam, would be on his hands if he announced the new position.|$|E
