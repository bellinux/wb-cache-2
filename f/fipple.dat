25|$|The Generation whistle was {{introduced}} {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, and also featured a brass tube with a lead <b>fipple</b> plug. The design was updated somewhat over the years, most notably the substitution of a plastic <b>fipple</b> for the lead plug design.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{whistles}} today {{are made of}} brass tubing, or nickel plated brass tubing, with a plastic <b>fipple</b> (mouthpiece). Generation, Feadóg, Oak, Acorn, Soodlum's (now Walton's), and other brands fall in this category. The next most common form is the conical sheet metal whistle with a wooden stop in the wide end to form the <b>fipple,</b> the Clarke's brand being the most prevalent. Other less common variants are the all-metal whistle, the PVC whistle, the Flanna square holed whistle, and the wooden whistle.|$|E

The labia or <b>fipples</b> (semi-circular openings near the blown ends of the pipes, characteristic of certain wind instruments, such as recorders and organs) are present.|$|R
25|$|Almost all {{primitive}} cultures had {{a type of}} <b>fipple</b> flute and is {{most likely}} the first pitched flute type instrument in existence. A possible Neanderthal <b>fipple</b> flute from Slovenia dates from 81,000-53,000 B.C., a German flute from 35,000 years ago, and flute made from sheep's bone in West Yorkshire dating to the Iron Age. Written sources that describe a fipple-type flute include the Roman and Greek aulos and tibia. In the early Middle Ages peoples of northern Europe were playing the instrument as seen in 3rd-century British bone flutes, and Irish Brehon Law describes flute like instrument. By the 12th century Italian flutes came {{in a variety of}} sizes, and fragments of 12th-century Norman bone whistles have been found in Ireland, and an intact 14cm Tusculum clay whistle from the 14th century in Scotland. In the 17th century whistles were called flageolets; a term to describe a whistle with a French made <b>fipple</b> headpiece (common to the modern penny whistle) and such instruments are linked {{to the development of the}} English flageolet, French flageolet and recorders of the renaissance and baroque period. The term flageolet is still preferred by some modern tin whistle who feel this better describes the instrument, as this characterises a wide variety of <b>fipple</b> flutes, including penny whistles.|$|E
25|$|On a {{transverse}} flute this is generally done by narrowing the lip/embouchure. Since {{the size and}} direction of the tin whistle's windway is fixed, like that of the recorder or <b>fipple</b> flute, it is necessary to increase the velocity of the air stream. (See overblowing).|$|E
25|$|The tin whistle in {{its modern}} form {{is from a}} wider family of <b>fipple</b> flutes which have been seen in many forms and {{cultures}} throughout the world. In Europe such instruments have a long and distinguished history and take various forms; most widely known of these are the recorder, tin whistle, Flabiol, Txistu and tabor pipe.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the whistle}} is {{essentially}} a diatonic instrument, {{it is possible to}} get notes outside the principal major key of the whistle, either by half-holing (partially covering the highest open finger hole) or by cross-fingering (covering some holes while leaving some higher ones open). However, half-holing is somewhat more difficult to do correctly, and whistles are available in many keys, so for other keys a whistler will typically use a different whistle instead, reserving half-holing for accidentals. Some whistle designs allow a single <b>fipple,</b> or mouthpiece, to be used on differently keyed bodies.|$|E
25|$|Another {{division}} is between side-blown (or transverse) flutes, {{such as the}} Western concert flute, piccolo, fife, dizi and bansuri; and end-blown flutes, such as the ney, xiao, kaval, danso, shakuhachi, Anasazi flute and quena. The player of a side-blown flute uses a hole {{on the side of}} the tube to produce a tone, instead of blowing on an end of the tube. End-blown flutes should not be confused with <b>fipple</b> flutes such as the recorder, which are also played vertically but have an internal duct to direct the air flow across the edge of the tone hole.|$|E
500|$|The conch shell (antsiva or angaroa) is a {{similarly}} ancient instrument {{believed to have}} been brought over by early Indonesian settlers. Mainly played by men, it features a lateral blow hole in the Polynesian style and is typically reserved for ritual or spiritual uses rather than to create music for entertainment. [...] The <b>fipple</b> flute is a simple aerophone brought to Madagascar after 1000 CE by immigrants from Africa.|$|E
2500|$|Tone: The {{tone of the}} tin whistle {{is largely}} {{determined}} by its manufacturing. Clarke style rolled metal whistles tend to have an airy [...] "impure" [...] sound, while Generation style cylindrical instruments tend to have clear or [...] "pure" [...] whistle sounds. Inexpensive rolled metal whistles, such as those from Cooperman Fife and Drum (which also produces high-end instruments) may be very airy in sound, and {{may be difficult to}} play in the upper register (second octave). Often placing a piece of tape over one edge of the <b>fipple</b> slot (just below the mouthpiece) to narrow the <b>fipple</b> will improve the instrument's tone and playability significantly.|$|E
2500|$|The {{airstream}} {{is directed}} on the labium by a <b>fipple</b> or internal duct, {{which is a}} narrowing rectangular slot in the mouthpiece, {{rather than relying on}} the player's lips as in a transverse flute. Like other flutes, the airstream alternates quickly between the inner and outer face of the labium as the pressure in the ocarina chamber oscillates.|$|E
2500|$|In {{its most}} basic form, a flute is an open tube which is blown into. After focused study and training, players use {{controlled}} air-direction to create an airstream in which the air is aimed downward into the tone hole of the flute's headjoint. There are several broad classes of flutes. With most flutes, the musician blows directly across {{the edge of the}} mouthpiece, with 1/4 of their bottom lip covering the embouchure hole. However, some flutes, such as the whistle, gemshorn, flageolet, recorder, tin whistle, tonette, fujara, and ocarina have a duct that directs the air onto the edge (an arrangement that is termed a [...] "fipple"). These are known as <b>fipple</b> flutes. The <b>fipple</b> gives the instrument a distinct timbre which is different from non-fipple flutes and makes the instrument easier to play, but takes a degree of control away from the musician.|$|E
2500|$|Other vessel flutes {{include the}} Chinese xun and African globe flutes. [...] The xun (simplified Chinese: 埙; traditional: 塤; pinyin: xūn) is a Chinese vessel flute made of clay or ceramic. It {{is one of}} the oldest Chinese instruments. Shaped like an egg, it differs from the ocarina in being side-blown, like the Western concert flute, rather than having a recorder-like {{mouthpiece}} (a <b>fipple</b> or beak). Similar instruments exist in Korea (the hun) and Japan (the tsuchibue).|$|E
2500|$|The tin whistle, {{also called}} the penny whistle, English flageolet, Scottish penny whistle, tin flageolet, Irish whistle, Belfast Hornpipe, [...] (or simply [...] ) and Clarke London Flageolet is a simple, six-holed woodwind instrument. It {{is a type of}} <b>fipple</b> flute, putting it in the same class as the recorder, Native American flute, and other woodwind {{instruments}} that meet such criteria. A tin whistle player is called a tin whistler or simply a whistler. The tin whistle is closely associated with Celtic music.|$|E
2500|$|Stringed {{instruments}} are common among the Antandroy. [...] They construct marovany (box zithers) from pine planks, using unwound bicycle cables as strings. The mandolina and gitara are the Antandroy names {{of a popular}} Southern chordophone similar to the kabosy but with nylon fishing line for strings and five or seven movable frets that facilitate modification of the instrument's tuning. The lokanga is a stringed instrument popular with the Antandroy that has a gourd resonator and is played with a bow, much like the jejy voatavo played further north, but with the resonator carved to resemble a three-stringed fiddle. [...] Antandroy vocal music features rich polyharmonic melodies. [...] The unique traditional dances of the Antandroy are performed with spears and accompanied by distinctive music punctuated with shrill whistles and [...] <b>fipple</b> flutes.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the penny}} whistle was {{generally}} considered a toy {{it has been}} suggested that children or street musicians were paid a penny by those who heard them playing the whistle. However, in reality the instrument was so called because it could be purchased for a penny. The name [...] "tin-whistle" [...] was also coined as early as 1825. but neither the tin whistle nor the penny whistle name seems to have been common until the 20th century. The instrument became popular in several musical traditions namely: English, Scottish, Irish and American traditional music. Due to its affordability the tin whistle was a popular household instrument, as ubiquitous as the harmonica. In the second half of the 19th century, some flute manufacturers such as Barnett Samuel and Joseph Wallis also sold whistles. These had a cylindrical brass tube. Like many old whistles, they had lead <b>fipple</b> plugs, and since lead is poisonous, caution should be exercised before playing an old whistle.|$|E
2500|$|The modern penny whistle is {{indigenous}} to the British Isles particularly England when factory-made [...] "tin whistles" [...] were produced by Robert Clarke from 1840–1882 in Manchester and later New Moston, England. Down to 1900, {{they were also}} marketed as [...] "Clarke London Flageolets" [...] or [...] "Clarke Flageolets". The whistle's fingering system {{is similar to that}} of the six hole, [...] "simple system English flutes" [...] ("simple" [...] in comparison to Boehm system flutes). The six hole, diatonic system is also used on baroque flutes, and was of course well known before Robert Clarke began producing his tin whistles. Clarke's first whistle, the Meg, was pitched in high A and was later made in other keys suitable for Victorian parlour music. The company showed the whistles in The Great Exhibition of 1851. The Clark tin whistle is voiced somewhat on an organ-pipe with a flattened tube forming the lip of the <b>fipple</b> mouthpiece and is usually made from rolled tin sheet or brass. Manufactured tin whistles became available no earlier than 1840, and were mass-produced and widespread due to their relative affordability.|$|E
50|$|A <b>fipple</b> is a {{constricted}} mouthpiece {{common to}} many end-blown flutes, {{such as the}} tin whistle and the recorder. These instruments are known variously as <b>fipple</b> flutes, duct flutes, or tubular-ducted flutes.|$|E
50|$|On a <b>fipple</b> flute the mouthpiece, or <b>fipple,</b> {{provides}} a shaped passageway for air to be blown against an edge, producing turbulent flow which excites the resonant vibrational modes {{of the air}} column.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{varieties}} of bansuri: transverse and <b>fipple.</b> The <b>fipple</b> flute is usually played in folk music and is {{held at the}} lips like a tin whistle.

50|$|Whereas {{internal}} ducted flutes {{have one}} <b>fipple</b> {{mechanism for the}} mouth of the player, along with several finger holes that share the one <b>fipple</b> mechanism, the hydraulophone has a separate mouth/mouthpiece for each finger hole.
