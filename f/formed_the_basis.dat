5|$|According to van der Waerden's {{obituary}} of Emmy Noether, she did {{not follow}} a lesson plan for her lectures, which frustrated some students. Instead, she used her lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with her students, to think through and clarify important cutting-edge problems in mathematics. Some of her most important results were developed in these lectures, and the lecture notes of her students <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for several important textbooks, {{such as those of}} van der Waerden and Deuring.|$|E
5|$|After her commissioning, Sachsen {{joined the}} German fleet, which was tasked {{primarily}} with coastal defense against France and Russia, who were {{presumed to be}} the most likely enemies in a continental war.

5|$|After the war, Moore {{returned}} to Melbourne, where he painted images from his Belsen sketches and photographs. They were exhibited commercially, {{but failed to}} sell.

5|$|Brennus was {{the first}} pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy built in the late 19th century. She was laid down in January 1889, launched in October 1891, and completed in 1896. Her design was unique and departed from earlier ironclad battleship designs by introducing a number of innovations. These included a main battery of heavy guns mounted on the centerline and the first use of Belleville boilers. She <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for several subsequent designs, beginning with Charles Martel.|$|E
5|$|Brennus was {{the first}} pre-dreadnought style {{battleship}} built in the French Navy; the previous Magenta-class ships were barbette ships, a type of ironclad battleship. Brennus <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for the subsequent group of five broadly similar battleships built to the same design specifications, begun with Charles Martel, though they reverted to the armament layout of the earlier Magentas which saw the main guns distributed in single turrets in a lozenge pattern.|$|E

5|$|De Materia Medica was {{circulated}} as illustrated manuscripts, copied by hand, in Greek, Latin and Arabic throughout the mediaeval period.

5|$|Feminist {{theory can}} also be seen at play in Stowe's book, with the novel as a {{critique}} of the patriarchal nature of slavery. For Stowe, blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves <b>formed</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person's family, thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing a shared race. Consequently, she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into American society.|$|E
