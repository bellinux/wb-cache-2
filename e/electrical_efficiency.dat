5|$|LIFE, {{short for}} Laser Inertial Fusion Energy, was a fusion energy effort run at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory between 2008 and 2013. LIFE {{aimed to develop}} the {{technologies}} necessary to convert the laser-driven inertial confinement fusion concept being developed in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) into a practical commercial power plant, a concept known generally as inertial fusion energy (IFE). Two designs were considered, operated as either a pure fusion or hybrid fusion-fission system. LIFE used the same basic concepts as NIF, but aimed to lower costs using mass-produced fuel elements, simplified maintenance, and diode lasers with higher <b>electrical</b> <b>efficiency.</b>|$|E

40|$|The most {{sustainable}} technology for conversion {{of natural gas}} into electricity and heat in the low to medium power levels, is a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) based Combined Heat and Power (CHP) unit. <b>Electrical</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of up to 60 % and total efficiencies of more than 90 % down to electrical powers of only 1 kW, makes these systems attractive for applications in varying power classes. The range between 10 and 50 kWel is especially promising for competition with conventional CHP units and the electrical grid. Different system layouts options exist to meet the technical requirements of specific applications {{as well as the}} cost targets for a early market entry. Main distinguishing features are the method of processing natural gas into a hydrogen-rich reformate (i. e. partial oxidation vs. steam reforming) and the cell stack technology used. As a result, <b>electrical</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> system complexity, and costs vary. Applied to cogeneration, the overall efficiency has the ma in impact on the profitability of the CHP unit, provided there is existence of a sufficient heat demand. <b>Electrical</b> <b>efficiencies</b> are dominated by power to heat ratios or the utilization factor, this means the number of operation hours needs to be increased. The calculation of CHP cost saving potentials is impeded strongly by application dependent parameters like profiles of heat and electricity demand as well as local gas and electricity prices. For Germany, payback periods can be calculated since typical load profiles of single and multi-family homes are available. Here, the choice of SOFC system layout depends on the economic viability of electricity feed-in to the grid. If funding is available, high <b>electrical</b> <b>efficiencies</b> are clearly favored. This is also valid for applications where only domestic hot water heating is required. Small base load power generators are profitable provided that the system cost targets can be met.

25|$|A {{balanced}} armature is a {{sound transducer}} design primarily intended to increase the <b>electrical</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the element by eliminating the stress on the diaphragm characteristic of many other magnetic transducer systems. As shown schematically in the first diagram, it consists of a moving magnetic armature that is pivoted so it can move {{in the field of}} the permanent magnet. When precisely centered in the magnetic field there is no net force on the armature, hence the term 'balanced.' As illustrated in the second diagram, when there is electric current through the coil, it magnetizes the armature {{one way or the other}}, causing it to rotate slightly one way or the other about the pivot thus moving the diaphragm to make sound.|$|E

40|$|The <b>electrical</b> {{conversion}} <b>efficiency</b> {{of large-scale}} photovoltaics {{is dependent on}} the operating temperature of the photovoltaic module. Therefore, if a tool for analyzing the annual <b>electrical</b> conversion <b>efficiency</b> could be developed {{on the basis of the}} climatic conditions at the system installation site, it would be effective for assessing system economy. Accordingly, an analysis method was developed in this study to determine the temperature distribution and <b>electrical</b> conversion <b>efficiency</b> of a photovoltaic module by considering the wind conditions at the installation site. Modular temperature distribution and DC <b>electrical</b> conversion <b>efficiency</b> were obtained by introducing the physical properties of the photovoltaic module, wind conditions, and climatic conditions (plane of array irradiance and ambient temperature) by using a digital three-dimensional topographic map in a heat-transfer calculation. The case analysis results suggest a high value for the power-production efficiency for low ambient temperature. However, the difference in the temperature distribution of the photovoltaic module in relation to the difference in the ambient temperature is strongly influenced by wind velocity and wind direction. Moreover, when a large-scale photovoltaic power plant is installed on a complicated mountain slope, the cooling effect is controlled so that the indraft wind velocity on the photovoltaic module decreases. Therefore, in order to maintain high <b>electrical</b> conversion <b>efficiency</b> in the photovoltaic module, the best location for installation is an airy and flat area, as much as possible. According to the case analysis, the <b>electrical</b> conversion <b>efficiency</b> of the photovoltaic module at the time of the analysis under wind condition increased 23 % (maximum) compared with that without wind conditions...|$|R
