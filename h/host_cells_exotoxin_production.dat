40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen {{of animals}} and humans, particularly those with compromised immunity such as organ transplant recipients, cystic fibrosis patients, people with AIDS and the severely burned. Clinical strains often carry genes for multiple virulence factors. Collectively these virulence factors assist the bacterium to attach, colonise and penetrate host tissue and destroy <b>host</b> <b>cells.</b> <b>Exotoxin</b> A (ETA) is a virulence factor that is expressed by approximately 80 % of human clinical isolates. Systemic ETA kills cells in susceptible organs, including the liver and kidney, which can result {{in the death of}} the patient 1, 2. Using a murine full thickness skin chamber model we investigated local production and systemic distribution of ETA in a dermal wound of infection...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III {{secretion}} apparatus {{exports and}} translocates four exotoxins into the cytoplasm of the <b>host</b> <b>cell.</b> The translocation requires two hydrophobic bacterial proteins, PopB and PopD, {{that are found}} associated with <b>host</b> <b>cell</b> membranes following infection. In this work we examined the influence of <b>host</b> <b>cell</b> elements on <b>exotoxin</b> translocation efficiency. We developed a quantitative flow cytometry based assay of translocation that used protein fusions between either ExoS or ExoY and the ß-lactamase reporter enzyme. In parallel, association of translocon proteins with host plasma membranes was evaluated by immunodetection of PopB/D following sucrose gradient fractionation of membranes. A promyelocytic cell line (HL- 60) and a pro-monocytic cell line (U 937) were found resistant to toxin injection even though PopB/D associated with <b>host</b> <b>cell</b> plasma membranes. Differentiation of these cells to either macrophage- or neutrophil-like cell lines resulted in injection-sensitive phenotype without significantly changing the level of membrane-inserted translocon proteins. As previous in vitro {{studies have indicated that}} the lysis of liposomes by PopB and PopD requires both cholesterol and phosphatidyl-serine, we first examined the role of cholesterol in translocation efficiency. Treatment of sensitive HL- 60 cells with methyl-ß-cyclodextrine, a cholesterol-depleting agent, resulted in a diminished injection of ExoS-Bla. Moreover, the PopB translocator was found in the membrane fraction, obtained from sucrose-gradient purifications, containing the lipid-raft marker flotillin.

Two lines of evidence indicated that lysogeny per se was not sufficient to promote toxigenic conversion of strain T 253. First, a virulent mutant of phage T 12, unable to form stable lysogens, was able to affect type A <b>exotoxin</b> <b>production</b> by strain T 253. An unrelated virulent phage A 25 did not affect type A <b>exotoxin</b> <b>production</b> after {{infection of}} strain T 253. Second, the temperate phage H 4489 A, which established stable lysogens with strain T 253 did not promote type A <b>exotoxin</b> <b>production.</b> These results suggest that there is a strain specificity to the phage-host interaction which affects type A exotoxin synthesis.

40|$|Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, {{cause serious}} human {{illnesses}} through combinations of surface virulence factors and secretion of exotoxins. Our prior studies using the protein synthesis inhibitor clindamycin and signal transduction inhibitors glycerol monolaurate and a-globin and b-globin chains of hemoglobin indicate that {{their abilities to}} inhibit <b>exotoxin</b> <b>production</b> by S. aureus are separable from abilities to inhibit growth of the organism. Additionally, our previous studies suggest that inhibition of <b>exotoxin</b> <b>production,</b> in absence of ability to kill S. aureus and normal flora lactobacilli, will prevent colonization by pathogenic S. aureus, while not interfering with lactobacilli colonization. These disparate activities may be important in development of novel anti-infective agents that do not alter normal flora. We initiated studies to explore the exotoxin-synthesis-inhibition activity of hemoglobin peptides further to develop potential agents to prevent S. aureus infections. We tested synthesized a-globin chain peptides, synthetic variants of a-globin chain peptides, and two human defensins for ability to inhibit <b>exotoxin</b> <b>production</b> without significantly inhibiting S. aureus growth. All of these peptides were weakly or not inhibitory to bacterial growth. However, the peptides were inhibitory to <b>exotoxin</b> <b>production</b> with increasing activity dependent on increasing numbers of positively-charged amino acids.

40|$|As a {{model for}} bacterium-induced {{epithelial}} cell injury, we have studied the interaction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells grown on filters. Following an initial period of bacterial adhesion, foci of injured <b>host</b> <b>cells,</b> which consisted of a central region of cell debris, surrounded by cells that were permeable and apparently necrotic, were formed. <b>Host</b> <b>cell</b> death was quantified by measuring the increased permeability of the monolayer to the macromolecular tracer [14 C]inulin. Using this MDCK model system, we have identified bacterial and <b>host</b> <b>cell</b> factors necessary for the <b>host</b> <b>cell</b> damage. The ability of P. aeruginosa to cause MDCK cell damage was independent of elastase or <b>exotoxin</b> A <b>production.</b> In contrast, bacteria with a mutation in the regulatory locus exsA (which are deficient in exoenzyme S production) neither bound to nor caused <b>host</b> <b>cell</b> injury.

Because clindamycin inhibits <b>exotoxin</b> <b>production,</b> its use has been advocated for the treatment of TSS. However, the bacteriostatic action of clindamycin might be a disadvantage for the treatment of overwhelming infections. We investigated the effects of flucloxacillin and gentamicin on <b>exotoxin</b> <b>production,</b> because incubation with these antibiotics combines bactericidal action with protein synthesis inhibition. Staphylococcus aureus during the logarithmic and stationary phases of growth was incubated with either clindamycin, flucloxacillin, or a combination of flucloxacillin and gentamicin at concentrations of 2 or 10 times the MIC. In logarithmic-phase cultures clindamycin had a static effect on bacterial growth. After incubation with flucloxacillin, either alone or in combination with gentamicin, a rapid and large {{reduction in the number of}} viable bacteria was demonstrated. In stationary-phase cultures none of the antibiotics significantly changed the number of viable bacteria. TSS toxin 1 (TSST- 1) production during logarithmic-phase growth was inhibited by > or = 95 % by all antibiotics. In stationary-phase cultures, clindamycin, flucloxacillin, and the combination of flucloxacillin and gentamicin inhibited TSST- 1 production by 95, 30, and 75 %, respectively, compared with the level of <b>exotoxin</b> <b>production</b> in the controls. The present results indicate that clindamycin inhibits TSST- 1 production and exerts bacteriostatic activity in both bacterial growth phases. Because the combination of flucloxacillin and gentamicin combines the inhibition of <b>exotoxin</b> <b>production</b> with high bactericidal activity at least in logarithmic-phase cultures, it should be considered an alternative to clindamycin for the treatment of exotoxin-mediated diseases, especially in patients with overwhelming infections...|$|R

Methodology/Principal Findings: Antimicrobial effects of GML and DDG (0 to 500 mg/ml) on 54 clinical isolates of S. aureus, including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types USA 200, USA 300, and USA 400, were determined in vitro.

DDG (50 and 100 microg/ml) inhibited S. aureus growth in vitro more effectively than GML (p< 0. 01) and was stable to lipase degradation. Unlike GML, DDG inhibition of TSST- 1 was dependent on S. aureus growth. GML-treated (4 of 5; 80 %) and DDG-treated rabbits (2 of 5; 40 %) survived after 7 days. Control rabbits (5 of 5; 100 %) succumbed by day 4. GML suppressed TNF-alpha at the infection site on day 7; however, DDG did not (< 10 ng/ml versus 80 ng/ml, respectively). These data suggest that DDG was stable to S. aureus lipase and inhibited S. aureus growth at lower concentrations than GML in vitro.
