50|$|The {{species is}} listed as {{endangered}} by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service under the Endangered Species Act. The principal cause {{of the decline in}} <b>Guadalupe</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> was commercial sealing. The species is now protected from such activity throughout its range, and the magnitude of the threat to the species is considered to be low. The portion of the <b>Guadalupe</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal's</b> range which is under U.S. jurisdiction is at the limit of the species range. No activities in areas under U.S. jurisdiction are known to be adversely affecting recovery of this species now. Therefore, management activities in the U.S. portion of its range are not likely to contribute substantially to recovery. However, <b>Guadalupe</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> are protected from federal actions that are likely to jeopardize the species through interagency coordination under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. No other specific actions necessary for the recovery of the species have been identified, and no direct recovery actions are being implemented.|$|R

40|$|<b>Guadalupe</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (Arctocephalus townsendi) were {{decimated}} by 19 th century commercial sealers {{in the northeastern}} Pacific and thought to be extinct until 1928 when commercial fishermen caught two adult males at Isla de Guadalupe {{from a group of}} up to 60 adults and pups (Wedgeforth 1928, Huey 1930). These two animals were brought to the San Diego Zoo, prompting several zoological expeditions to Isla de Guadalupe in the 1930 s and 1940 s, but none successfully located <b>Guadalupe</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals.</b> In 1949, a single male was seen on San Nicolas Island, California (Bartholomew 1950), and in 1954, a small breeding group of animals was found in a cave at Isla de Guadalupe (Hubbs 1956). The population had grown to at least 500 animals in 1967, to about 7, 400 animals in 1993, and to 12, 176 in 2003, with breeding populations currently confined to Mexico’s Islas de Guadalupe and San Benito (Peterson et al. 1968, Gallo-Reynoso 1994, Gallo-Reynoso et al. 2005, Carretta et al. 2007). Although small numbers of <b>Guadalupe</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> haul out on the California Channel Islands today, including a female and single pup born on San Miguel Island in 1997, they are vastly outnumbered by California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris), northern <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (Callorhinus ursinus), and harbor seals (Phoca vitulina), all of which currently breed on San Miguel Island (Stewart et al. 1993, Melin and DeLong 1999, DeLong and Melin 2002). Archaeological and genetic data suggest, however, that the modern distribution and abundance of <b>Guadalupe</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> are very different from prehistoric distributions (Walker and Craig 1979, Colten 2002, Etnier 2002 a, Walker et al. 2002, Weber et al. 2004) ...|$|R

Seasonal cycles in {{abundance of}} northern elephant seals, California sea lions, harbor <b>seals,</b> and <b>Guadalupe</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> at San Nicolas Island, California, were monitored by frequent ground and aerial surveys from February 1980 through September 1982. Northern elephant seals were most abundant in late January and early February {{during the height}} of their breeding season and again in late April to early May when juveniles and adult females hauled out to molt. Sea lions were most abundant in late June to early July {{during the height of}} their breeding season and were least abundant in winter and early spring. Harbor seals were in greatest abundance in late May to early June when they were molting and numbers were lowest in winter. <b>Guadalupe</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> were present from June through September during their breeding season.

40|$|AbstractTissue-cyst forming coccidia in {{the family}} Sarcocystidae are {{etiologic}} agents of protozoal encephalitis in marine mammals including the federally listed Southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris). California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), whose coastal habitat overlaps with sea otters, are definitive hosts for coccidian protozoa provisionally named Coccidia A, B and C. While Coccidia A and B have unknown clinical effects on aquatic wildlife hosts, Coccidia C is associated with severe protozoal disease in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina). In this study, we conducted surveillance for protozoal infection and fecal shedding in hospitalized and free-ranging California sea lions on the Pacific Coast and examined oocyst morphology and phenotypic characteristics of isolates via mouse bioassay and cell culture. Coccidia A and B were shed in similar frequency, particularly by yearlings. Oocysts shed by one free-ranging sea lion sampled at Año Nuevo State Park in California were previously unidentified in sea lions and were most similar to coccidia infecting <b>Guadalupe</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (Arctocephalus townsendi) diagnosed with protozoal disease in Oregon (USA). Sporulated Coccidia A and B oocysts did not replicate in three strains of mice or in African green monkey kidney cells. However, cultivation experiments revealed that the inoculum of fecally-derived Coccidia A and B oocysts additionally contained organisms with genetic and antigenic similarity to Sarcocystis neurona; {{despite the absence of}} detectable free sporocysts in fecal samples by microscopic examination. In addition to the further characterization of Coccidia A and B in free-ranging and hospitalized sea lions, these results provide evidence of a new role for sea lions as putative mechanical vectors of S.  neurona, or S.  neurona-like species. Future work is needed to clarify the distribution, taxonomical status, and pathogenesis of these parasites in sea lions and other marine mammals that share their the near-shore marine environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{abundance}} of California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) (CSLs) and <b>Guadalupe</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (Arctocephalus philippii townsendi) (GFSs) from the San Benito Archipelago (SBA) was determined through nine monthly surveys in 2014 - 2015. Assessment of their foraging habits was examined {{based on the}} isotopic analysis of pups (maternal indicators) (SIAR/SIBER-R). Environmental variability between 2014 and 2015 was also analyzed, in terms of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll (Chl-a) concentration. Both otariids reached their highest abundance in July of both years; however, relative to 2014, the 2015 survey showed a 59. 7 % decline in the total GFS abundance and a 42. 9 % decrease of GFS pups, while total CSL abundance decreased 52. 0 % and CSL pup presence decreased in 61. 7 %. All monthly surveys for both otariids showed a similar trend (> 50 % decrease in 2015). Compared to 2014, the 2015 GFSs isotopic niche was three times larger (2. 0 in 2015, 0. 6 in 2014) and the δ 13 C was significantly lower. CSLs also showed significantly lower δ 13 C and higher δ 15 N in 2015. Interannual segregation was greater for CSLs, and their pup body mass was also significantly lower during the 2015 breeding season (mean = 8. 7 kg) than in the same season of 2014 (mean = 9. 9 kg). The decrease in δ 13 C for both otariids reflected a more oceanic foraging; most likely associated with the decline in primary productivity in surrounding areas to the SBA, related to a higher SST caused by the 2015 ENSO, with a subsequent increase in foraging effort. These would explain the fewer observed individuals on land, especially pups, which showed diminished body condition (CSLs). This study {{highlights the importance of}} marine mammals as sentinel species that respond dynamically to changes in environment, providing valuable information on the effect of ENSO on pinnipeds in Mexican waters...|$|R
50|$|Many {{fur seal}} species were heavily {{exploited}} by commercial sealers, {{especially during the}} 19th century when their fur was highly valued. Beginning in the 1790s, the ports of Stonington and New Haven, Connecticut, were leaders of the American fur seal trade, which primarily entailed clubbing fur seals to death on uninhabited South Pacific islands, skinning them, and selling the hides in China. Many populations, notably the <b>Guadalupe</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> northern fur seal, and Cape fur seal, suffered dramatic declines and are still recovering. Currently, most species are protected and hunting is mostly limited to subsistence harvest. Globally, most populations can be considered healthy, mostly because they often prefer remote habitats that are relatively inaccessible to humans. Nonetheless, environmental degradation, competition with fisheries, and climate change potentially pose threats to some populations.|$|E
5000|$|Guadalupe Island {{was a major}} {{destination}} for Russian and American fur hunters seeking the <b>Guadalupe</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> (Arctocephalus townsendi) in the 18th and 19th centuries, until they were nearly extinct by 1844. Captain Auguste Duhaut-Cilly reported in 1827 that a Sandwich Islands (Hawaiian Islands) brig [...] "had spent several months there and collected three thousand sealskins". The northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) was also ruthlessly hunted for the oil in its blubber. They {{were thought to be}} extinct in 1884 until a remnant population of eight individuals was discovered on Guadalupe Island in 1892 by a Smithsonian expedition, who promptly killed seven of them for their collections. The elephant seals managed to survive, and were finally protected by the Mexican government in 1922. All surviving northern elephant seals share the same male ancestor.|$|E
50|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} {{the discovery of the}} islands, during the Maritime Fur Trade era, the islands were exploited by seal hunters, first from New England and later from Russia. The Russians maintained a sealing station in the Farallones from 1812 to 1840, taking 1,200 to 1,500 fur seals annually, though American ships had already exploited the islands. The Albatross, captained by Nathan Winship, and the O'Cain, captained by his brother Jonathan Winship, were the first American ships sent from Boston in 1809 to establish a settlement on the Columbia River. In 1810, they met up with two other American ships at the Farallon Islands, the Mercury and the Isabella, and at least 30,000 seal skins were taken. By 1818 the seals diminished rapidly until only about 500 could be taken annually and within the next few years, the fur seal was extirpated from the islands.
