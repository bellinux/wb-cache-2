When one passes {{to the class}} of <b>dependent</b> <b>formulas,</b> this notion of definability of types is lost. However, as this dissertation shows, we can recover suitable alternatives to definability of types for some dependent theories. Using these alternatives, we can recover some {{of the power of}} stability theory. One alternative is uniform definability of types over finite sets (UDTFS). We show that all formulas in dp-minimal theories have UDTFS, as well as formulas with VC-density < 2. We also show that certain Henselian valued fields have UDTFS. Another alternative is isolated extensions. We show that <b>dependent</b> <b>formulas</b> are characterized by the existence of isolated extensions, and show how this gives a weak stable embeddability result.

40|$|By {{simplifying}} {{the direct}} interaction approximation (DIA) for turbulent shear flow, time <b>dependent</b> <b>formulas</b> are derived for the Reynolds stresses {{which can be}} included in two equation models. The Green's function is treated phenomenologically, however, following Smith and Yakhot, we insist on the short and long time limits required by DIA. For small strain rates, perturbative evaluation of the correlation function yields a time dependent theory which includes normal stress effects in simple shear flows. From this standpoint, the phenomenological Launder-Reece-Rodi model is obtained by replacing the Green's function by its long time limit. Eddy damping corrections to short time behavior initiate too quickly in this model; in contrast, the present theory exhibits strong suppression of eddy damping at short times. A time dependent theory for large strain rates is proposed in which large scales are governed by rapid distortion theory while small scales are governed by Kolmogorov inertial range dynamics. At short times and large strain rates, the theory closely matches rapid distortion theory, but at long times it relaxes to an eddy damping model...|$|R

40|$|A {{random phase}} {{property}} establishing {{a link between}} quasi-one-dimensional random Schroedinger operators and full random matrix theory is advocated. Briefly summarized it states that the random transfer matrices placed into a normal system of coordinates act on the isotropic frames and lead to a Markov process with a unique invariant measure which is of geometric nature. On the elliptic part of the transfer matrices, this measure is invariant under the full hermitian symplectic group of the universality class under study. While the random phase property can up to now only be proved in special models or in a restricted sense, we provide strong numerical evidence that it holds in the Anderson model of localization. A main outcome of the random phase property is a perturbative calculation of the Lyapunov exponents which shows that the Lyapunov spectrum is equidistant and that the localization lengths for large systems in the unitary, orthogonal and symplectic ensemble differ by a factor 2 each. In an Anderson-Ando model on a tubular geometry with magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling, the normal system of coordinates is calculated and this is used to derive explicit energy <b>dependent</b> <b>formulas</b> for the Lyapunov spectrum...|$|R

The responses to these signals also allow to estimate the temporary alteration of the medium when repeated positive (negative) signals are input; the response increases (decreases) in amplitude when the signals are all positive (negative), it decreases when the signals are alternatively positive and negative in agreement with the known attitude of the medium to induced polarization...|$|E
