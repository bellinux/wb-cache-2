40|$|Questions {{concerning}} the epistemological status of computer science are, in this paper, answered {{from the point}} of view of the formal verification framework. State space reduction techniques adopted to simplify computational models in model checking are analysed in terms of Aristotelian abstractions and Galilean idealizations characterizing the inquiry of empirical systems. Methodological considerations drawn here are employed to argue in favour of the scientific understanding of computer science as a discipline. Specifically, reduced models gained by Data Abstraction are acknowledged as Aristotelian abstractions that include only data which are sufficient to examine the interested executions. The present study highlights how the need to maximize incompatible properties is at the basis of both Abstraction Refinement, the process of generating a cascade of computational models to achieve a balance between simplicity and informativeness, and the Multiple Model Idealization approach in biology. Finally, fairness constraints, imposed to computational models to allow <b>fair</b> <b>behaviours</b> only, are defined as ceteris paribus conditions under which temporal formulas, formalizing software requirements, acquire the status of law-like statements about the software systems executions...|$|R

40|$|The {{experimental}} investigation {{presented here}} {{is meant to}} contribute to the psychology of <b>fair</b> <b>behaviour.</b> It takes as its starting point the current controversial hypothesis that a continuum of fair behavioural modi in social situations exists, and that actual behaviour can vary along it. This conflicts with the concept that people always act according to their own self interest. These fair behavioural modi differ in extent of fairness depending on particular situational conditions, such as resources available and social distance between actors. In order to test these hypotheses the reciprocal distribution behaviour of 138 Subjects was examined on a computer network in an experimental laboratory investigation. The subjects were grouped in triads and distributed money allotted to them to the other playing partners. There were altogether 200 trials. At the end of the investigation subjects received the money assigned to them from the other players. There were different social situations in which subjects were brought to this same experimental situation. They played in varying social distance to one another, operationalised as degree of familiarity and anonymity. Further, the triads found themselves in a situation in which subjects were either allocated the same initial resources or had unequal amounts of initial resources available to them. It could be shown that distribution behaviour can be predicted with fairness models, above all using analysis of variance and regression analytic evaluation methods of global, pair or position levels. Already at the global group level distribution tendencies were observed which were quite compatible with fairness assumptions, yet not very compatible with self-interest tendencies. The analysis at the pair level showed the effect of the situational condition on the reciprocal relationship between the subjects. Greater social distance resulted in distribution behaviour tending {{in the direction of the}} fairness principle of reciprocal distribution and, therefore, weaker profit orientation. In conditions of smaller social distance, subjects demonstrated clear tendencies in the direction of the fairness principle of equal distribution. For unequal initial resources, strong self-interested behaviour would have been expressed, for example, in the building of global coalitions and exclusive allotment of the contributions between resource-rich subjects. This could not be observed. Indeed, for greater social distance, distribution behaviour was shown which tends to be compatible with self-interested behaviour, especially for the resource-rich in the condition with unequal initial resources. This behaviour could be seen as self-interested distortion of <b>fair</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The results of the investigation, therefore, support the assumptions that social distribution behaviour is influenced by motives of fairness, whereas for unequal resources and larger social distance between people, self-interested distortions may occur. It can therefore be concluded, with the support of other experimental investigations, that a fairness standard exists which can shift due to situational influences...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the predictors of punitive attitudes towards young offenders among police officers. This included an examination of variables such as officers’ coping styles, mental health, rank and age. It was predicted that indirect coping styles, mental health difficulties, higher age and higher rank would negatively impact on punitive attitudes towards young offenders. Officers reporting direct coping strategies, low levels of mental health difficulties, lower rank and lower age were expected to have less punitive and more rehabilitative attitudes towards young offenders. Design/methodology/approach – A sample of 83 police officers and community support officers from the UK completed standardised self-report measures. Findings – Indirect coping strategies, high levels of mental health difficulties and high rank were all associated with more punitive attitudes, whilst age had no impact. Research limitations/implications – Results are discussed with regard to their research and real world implications. These include an impact of these findings on the job performance, community safety, approaches to policing, and the well-being of police officers. The importance of mental well-being, direct coping and positive attitudes towards young offenders is indicated in order for police officers to employ more proactive, consistent and <b>fair</b> <b>behaviour</b> with this group, leading to less punitive outcomes for young offenders, as well as improved police-youth relations.

40|$|In {{the present}} research, I examine whether {{independent}} and interdependent self-construals influence behaviour toward innocent others following unfair treatment from an authority. Fairness researchers have documented many {{negative effects of}} unfair treatment on recipients’ thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. From the recipient’s perspective, unfair treatment {{is a sign that}} the recipient is inferior and unworthy of respect, leading to decreased self-esteem (e. g., Tyler, Degoey, & Smith, 1996). Although this decrease in self-esteem among recipients of unfair treatment may be universal, individual differences in behavioural reactions to unfairness are evident. Prior research and theory suggest that the need to maintain one’s self-esteem is fundamental (e. g., Maslow, 1968; Rogers, 1961; Rosenberg, 1979), and that individuals engage {{in a wide range of}} behaviours to maintain their self-esteem (Steele, 1988). Recent research suggests that the types of behaviours individuals use to restore their self-esteem following unfairness vary according to the source of their self-esteem. Specifically, individuals with a stronger independent self-construal, who derive self-esteem from being unique and getting ahead, may be more likely to enact revenge against those who treat them unfairly (Zdaniuk & Bobocel, 2009). Conversely, those with a stronger interdependent self-construal, who derive self-esteem from maintaining harmonious relationships, may be more likely to forgive (Bobocel & Zdaniuk, 2009). At times, engaging in revenge or forgiveness toward the perpetrator of unfairness may be difficult, especially if the perpetrator is an authority. In these situations, recipients of unfairness may maintain their self-esteem by engaging in unfair or <b>fair</b> <b>behaviours</b> directed toward innocent others. I predicted that after experiencing unfair treatment from an authority, individuals with a strong (versus weak) independent self-construal would be more likely to act unfairly toward fellow group members, and that individuals with a strong (versus weak) interdependent self-construal would be more likely to act fairly. These predictions were tested in two laboratory studies and one field study. Although the results were not consistent across the three studies, some support was found for both predictions. In addition, the findings are consistent with the notion that self-esteem maintenance was a mechanism underlying the predicted effects of the self-construals. The implications of the current findings for the fairness literature are discussed, and directions for future research are proposed. To avoid ripple effects of unfairness in the workplace, organizational authorities are advised to promote an interdependent, rather than independent, work environment...|$|R

40|$|Both biosociological and {{psychological}} models, {{as well as}} animal research, suggest that testosterone has {{a key role in}} social interactions(1 - 7). Evidence from animal studies in rodents shows that testosterone causes aggressive behaviour towards conspecifics(7).

However, many researchers have questioned this folk hypothesis(1 - 6), arguing that testosterone is primarily involved in status-related behaviours in challenging social interactions, but causal evidence that discriminates between these views is sparse. Here we show that the sublingual administration of a single dose of testosterone in women causes a substantial increase in <b>fair</b> bargaining <b>behaviour,</b> thereby reducing bargaining conflicts and increasing the efficiency of social interactions. However, subjects who believed that they received testosterone-regardless of whether they actually received it or not-behaved much more unfairly than those who believed that they were treated with placebo.

40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} resource manage-ment for in-network caching environments. We argue that in Information-Centric Networking environments, deterministically caching content messages at predefined places along the content delivery path results in unfair and inefficient content multiplexing between different content flows, {{as well as in}} significant caching redundancy. Instead, allocating resources along the path accord-ing to content flow characteristics results in better use of network resources and therefore, higher overall performance. The design principles of our proposed in-network caching scheme, which we call ProbCache, target these two outcomes, namely reduction of caching redundancy and fair content flow multiplexing along the delivery path. In particular, ProbCache approximates the caching capability of a path and caches contents probabilistically to: i) leave caching space for other flows sharing (part of) the same path, and ii) fairly multiplex contents in caches along the path from the server to the client. We elaborate on the content multiplexing fairness of ProbCache and find that it sometimes behaves in favour of content flows connected far away from the source, i. e., it gives higher priority to flows travelling longer paths, leaving little space shorter-path flows. We introduce an enhanced version of the main algorithm that guarantees <b>fair</b> <b>behaviour</b> to all participating content flows. We evaluate the proposed schemes in both homogeneous and heterogeneous cache size environments and formulate a frame-work for resource allocation in in-network caching environments. The proposed probabilistic approach to in-network caching exhibits ideal performance both in terms of network resource utilisation and in terms of resource allocation fairness among competing content flows. Finally, and in contrast to the expected behaviour, we find that the efficient design of ProbCache results in fast convergence to caching of popular content items...|$|E

As new challenges in electronic publishing (such as increases in the price of journals, cross-access and licensing issues) have led libraries {{from all over the world}} to organize in consortia, the rise in NILDE users has allowed the building of a cooperation network to promote resource sharing based on a degree of standard quality of service and <b>fair</b> <b>behaviour,</b> and to establish an efficient communication channel among libraries, consortia and publishers. It has been proved that, in order to accomplish effective resource sharing, libraries should be willing to fulfil document delivery on a reciprocal basis, both requesting and providing documents. In particular, each library should make its best effort to expose and update its holdings by actively participating in collective national OPACs or in Italian meta-OPACs. It has been shown how, by adhering to these principles, libraries start up a virtuous cycle within the NILDE network, increasing its own value. As a result, the growth rate of numbers of NILDE libraries has accelerated, showing that the above said resource sharing policy is a real building block for success. In order to guarantee scalability and high performance operations, the overall system architecture has been rethought, ending up in the design of a brand new piece of software. New technologies, referred to as Web 2. 0, have been incorporated into NILDE, making it an even more user-oriented and friendly tool for document delivery and scholar work...|$|E
40|$|Methodological Foundations of the Diagnosis of Olympic Knowledge, Values and Principles Olympic {{education}} {{is influenced by}} many institutions (IOC, NOC, NOA etc.) which are connected with cooperation with educational and scientific institutions at the university level. One of the possibilities to spread the Olympic idea among population is Olympic education at schools. The object of our research was to modify the Rychtecky`s Czech version of the original survey "Olympic questionnaire" by Telama et al. from 1998. At {{the same time we}} reduced the survey and created a shorter version more useful in school settings. Another object of our research was to identify and specify similar tendencies between 12 -year-old and 15 -year-old adolescents. It was followed by the evaluation of possible change in perception of values of the targeted population. Our sample consisted of 597 adolescents (12 and 15 years old) from 7 grammar schools from Southern Bohemia location. The results of our research demonstrated significant extremity in girls` attitudes (p< 0, 05 - p< 0, 001) toward the <b>fair</b> play <b>behaviour</b> in sport. Younger respondents also perceived fair play models more positively than older respondents (p< 0, 05) which was confirmed by bigger tolerance to violence by the older respondents (p< 0, 05). Older respondents had [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The National Research Council (CNR) Bologna Research Area Library is a {{multidisciplinary}} scientific library serving {{a community of}} about 1. 500 local and remote users among researchers staff, PhD, undergraduate students and visiting scientists. The Library became operative in 1997, progressively integrating the existing resources of the Institutes belonging to the Research Area thus reducing costs whilst increasing {{the quantity and quality}} of advanced library services, such as: access to over 6. 000 online journals, access to specialised bibliographical databases, document delivery, etc [...] . Library online collections cover, among the Earth Sciences, the fields of Geology, Ocenography, Climatology, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences. Among library services, the Document Delivery Service allows rapid supply of scientific documents, books, theses and other documents not owned by the Library through Inter-Library loan and exchange or purchase. This service is for internal users. On the other side, the Library offers rapid and comprehensive document supply and interlibrary loan to other Italian libraries from its extensive collection. Document Delivery (DD) plays an important role in Italian research and university libraries. The main Internet resources for Document Delivery and Resource Sharing are the Archivio Collettivo Nazionale dei Periodici (ACNP, the collective serials Italian catalogue), the Sistema Bibliotecario Nazionale Catalogue (SBN) and the MetaOpac Azalai Italiano (MAI). In 1999 the Library started a project aiming at the development of an Internet-based Document Delivery Service, in order to: - exploit the new Internet technologies; - promote cooperation among CNR and Italian university libraries; - reduce service costs; - achieve short turnaround times and higher user satisfaction. The resulting system, NILDE (Network Inter-Library Document Exchange), is a web based software for libraries and end-users, that allows libraries to manage the entire work-flow of document delivery activities. The main advantages for libraries are the provision of synthetic and analytical statistics, provision of performance indicators such as ?fill-rate? and ?turn-around time?, and support for secure electronic delivery via Internet by means of a file-uploading/web-server. The main advantages for end-users are the possibility to forward a document delivery request to their library from any OpenURL-compliant bibliographical database (e. g. Web of Science, Scopus, Scifinder, PubMed, CSA Illumina and SFX platforms) and to check the status of their requests. NILDE is presently used by more than 500 Italian libraries and counts about 3. 000 registered end-users. It has allowed to build up a large library network, based on cooperation, resource sharing and a degree of standard quality of service and <b>fair</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Technical-scientific and bio-medical libraries represent the core of the NILDE network, performing more than 80 % of the total number of document exchanges. The most recent progress and implementation of the NILDE project and software will be presented. We will also focus on the important contribution made by earth-science libraries to the NILDE network and how it will be possible to increase it, by actively involving even more libraries and complying with the user-needs of earth-scientists...|$|R
60|$|The {{success of}} that {{initiative}} dish; that first experiment of hers in cookery; was so entire, so unalloyed and perfect, that John Westlock and Tom agreed {{she must have}} been studying the art in secret for a long time past; and urged her to make a full confession of the fact. They were exceedingly merry over this jest, and many smart things were said concerning it; but John was not as <b>fair</b> in his <b>behaviour</b> as might have been expected, for, after luring Tom Pinch on for a long time, he suddenly went over to the enemy, and swore to everything his sister said. However, as Tom observed the same night before going to bed, it was only in joke, and John had always been famous for being polite to ladies, even when he was quite a boy. Ruth said, 'Oh! indeed!' She didn't say anything else.|$|R
