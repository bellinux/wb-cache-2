40|$|By any {{criterion}} - social, {{economic or}} political - The Department of <b>Employment's</b> <b>statistics</b> of unemployment {{are among the}} most important to be published. The monthly statistics in particular represent the primary source of current information on unemployment and, as such, command considerable media attention. Increasingly, however, each month's figures have met with growing scepticism about their ability to reflect the true level of joblessness in the economy. As a result, alternative unofficial estimates of unemployment, from the modest to the extreme, have proliferated.

[...] A study by the C. D. Howe Institute suggests that immigration cannot keep Canada's population young and could possibly contribute to population ageing in the near term.

Since the argument is based entirely on some simple mathematical features of the linear model, the result should be of interest in other fields of application as well.
