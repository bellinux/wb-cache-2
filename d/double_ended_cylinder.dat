40|$|The {{development}} of efficient explosion resistant containers requires knowledge of dynamic material properties {{and the ability}} to simulate both the explosive loading and the corresponding structural response. A lightweight, transportable containment vessel could be used {{as an integral part of}} the response to bomb-related terrorist activities. Several composite vessel designs have been developed by the Russian Federal Nuclear Center (RFNC-VNIIEF) and explosive experiments have been performed on open <b>ended</b> <b>cylinders</b> for the purpose of benchmarking analysis methods. The objective of the work presented here is to determine the mechanical properties of the cylinder materials and to investigate different methods for computational simulation of the cylinder response to blast loading. The open <b>ended</b> <b>cylinders</b> are made from a basalt fiber-epoxy composite material with and without a steel inner liner. Computational simulation is performed using LS-DYNA. The predicted response of the composite structure matches experimental data closely for three different test cylinder configurations...|$|R

50|$|His {{most notable}} {{personal}} achievement was the propeller driven <b>double</b> <b>ended</b> ferry, {{which is the}} most typical vehicle ferry in use today. The significance of his design was a shaft which could control propellers {{at both ends of the}} craft. Among the advantages was superior braking of the vessels, since paddle wheel propulsion systems could not effectively be reversed to slow the craft. Prior to propeller drives, <b>double</b> <b>ended</b> ferries had less usable width because of side wheel propulsion.|$|R
