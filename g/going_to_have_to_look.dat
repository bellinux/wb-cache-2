Bevin also called {{for the elimination of}} many of Kentucky's $10 billion in [...] "tax expenditures", which he called [...] "Frankfort-speak for loopholes". Asked to specify which expenditures he would eliminate, Bevin said, [...] "I'm {{not going to give you}} specifics at this point in time.

2500|$|On February 21, 2006, {{the newly}} elected Dover Area School Board voted, {{unanimously}} with one abstention, to pay $1,000,011 in legal fees and damages due to the parents and their lawyers {{as a result of}} the verdict in the case, a large sum of money for a small district. The previous school board had been offered the opportunity to rescind its policy, and avoid paying legal fees, immediately after the lawsuit was filed in 2004, but it declined. The parents' attorneys Pepper Hamilton stated that court records would show that they were entitled to more than $2 million, but were going to accept less than half that amount in recognition of the small size of the school district, and because the school board that voted for the policy had been voted out of office, leaving the new school board [...] "having the bill placed in their laps." [...] The previous school board had been defended without charge by the Thomas More Law Center. Richard Katskee, assistant legal director for Americans United, said of the trial's cost, [...] "Any board thinking of trying to do what the Dover board did is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for a bill in excess of $2 million," [...] and [...] "I think $2 million is a lot to explain to taxpayers for a lawsuit that should never be fought." ...|$|E

They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> provide security for it. And they’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do it sooner rather than later. ” This remark is striking for its ahistorical crassness and demonstrated a striking amount of chutzpah even by Secretary Rumsfeld’s standards.

Five days after Crist vetoed the Consumer Choice Act, Corless defended property insurance deregulation {{by pointing out that}} [...] "if the blue-chip insurance companies wanted to price themselves out of the market", then they would go out of business. He accused Crist of making choices on behalf of consumers, not protecting their right to choose.

5000|$|Fifty years later, Oak Park remains racially diverse. Predictions {{based on}} U.

These predictions {{did not come to}} pass—primarily because of the programs initiated in Oak Park as outlined in Raymond's thesis. Village government joined with the Housing Center to initiate dozens of programs, such as code enforcement, loans to improve apartment building security, training of apartment building managers and realtors, previewing of apartments to determine marketability, and encouraging thousands of Housing Center clients to consider moves which contributed to diversity. Raymond focused on integration strategy into the 1990s, saying, [...] "Over the next two decades, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> more and more beyond our own borders." ...|$|E
50|$|Once his wife, {{who he was}} set up {{beforehand}} to marry, {{arrives in}} America he then decides {{to move to a}} bigger home. Upon this decision, he also realizes that he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> out for and nurture his new wife. After living with his wife for some time, who he at first had barely known, he soon finds out that the elderly woman he had once lived with is now dead. This hurts him because this is the first person in America for whom he had felt any feelings. After the woman's death, he then becomes more comfortable with his wife, not because the woman died but because of the time he is spending with his wife. Just like his relationship with elderly woman, the more time he spends with a person the closer he becomes with them. After sometime the narrator falls in love with his wife and is constantly remembering the elderly woman with whom he had once lived.|$|E

40|$|Teacher {{education}} has too largely concerned {{itself with a}} study of schooling rather than a study of education. In the next generation, given the concerns that I’ve talked about, we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> much more intensively, on the one hand, at how much human beings learn as biological creatures and, on the other hand, at all the cultural and legal constraints on learning that exist. We will look at education in industry, in the community, in community action programs, in the tribal council, education through ritual, and through play, {{as well as through}} public schooling. The job of the graduate educator will be to know how people learn in order to create the legal, economic, and community mechanisms to help people learn in community how to achieve fulfillment in community. The pressure of the job market, of society, and of the law on the graduate teacher educator is going to move many graduate educators to become community clinicians—working in such areas as law, validation, economics, epistemology, and community building. In the future I look for the development of school-community teacher training centers. Graduate teacher educators, clinicians, will be hired by school districts and higher education. The group which will determine the day-to-day job of the teacher educator, the perimeters of that job, would be the parents themselves, and the children. The teacher educator will be the servant of the community. When I speak of the school-community teacher training center, I am talking about the general movement in this country toward combining the human services and centering them in the schools or centering them in single agencies...|$|E
