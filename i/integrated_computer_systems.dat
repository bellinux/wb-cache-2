40|$|Abstract — The DECOS {{architecture}} {{provides a}} framework for integrating multiple application systems within a single distributed computer system. Since the DECOS architecture aims at applications in the automotive, avionic, and industrial control domain, including applications up to the highest criticality level, the design and development process of DECOS-based <b>integrated</b> <b>computer</b> <b>systems</b> is of utmost importance. Within the DECOS project a model-based development process is devised which aims at enabling a reduced time-to-market in spite of increasing the system’s functionality, the reuse of application software on different instantiations of the DE-COS platform, and performing validation activities earlier in the development phase of <b>integrated</b> <b>computer</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper we outline the overall model-based development process of <b>integrated</b> <b>computer</b> <b>systems</b> based on the DECOS architecture with a strong focus on the modeling of the DECOS execution platform.

40|$|The {{necessity}} to introduce {{changes in the}} organization of work in libraries has been caused by introducing new telecommunications technologies, by implementing <b>integrated</b> <b>computer</b> <b>systems</b> such as programs for managing the resources and distributing information, as well as by creating digital libraries.

In the times of new management theories, the traditional, hierarchical management models have lost their effectiveness. The following paper presents new methods of organizing and managing libraries.

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{deductive}} program verification {{has improved}} {{to a degree}} that makes it feasible for real-world programs. Following this observation, the main goal of the Verisoft XT project is (a) the creation of methods and tools which allow for the pervasive formal verification of <b>integrated</b> <b>computer</b> <b>systems,</b> and (b) the prototypical realization of four concrete, industrial application tasks. In this paper, we report on the Verisoft XT subproject Avionics, where formal verification is applied to a commercial embedded operating system. The goal is to use deductive techniques to verify functional correctness of the PikeOS system, which is a microkernelbased partitioning hypervisor. We present our approach to verifying the microkernel’s system calls, using a system call for changing the priority of threads as an example. In particular, (a) we give an overview of the tool chain and the verification methodology, (b) we explain the hardware model and how assembly semantics is specified so that functions whose implementation contain assembly can be verified, and (c) we describe the verification of the system call itself. We also explain why this effort matters in regulatory dependability frameworks such as DO- 178 B and IEC 61508 for safety resp. Common Criteria for security. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the implications of}} working through globally <b>integrated</b> <b>computer</b> <b>systems</b> in transnational firms and addresses in particular employees’ possibility to give feedback on how these systems are working. The aim is to con-tribute to {{the literature on the}} standardization of IT with a focus on co-production by questioning the apparent neutrality of feedback processes. The literature focusing on co-production has shed light on the fact that stand-ardized IT systems are not fixed, but rather flexible {{in the sense that they}} are con-tinuously developed based on user feedback. However, based on my empirical case, I argue that employees identified the existence of a frame for acceptable criticism. Two different cases of business critical IT systems are presented; these cases share a common consensus among managers and employees that the systems required improvements. However, employees had experiences of providing business critical feedback on functionality that had not been acted upon. Conse-quently, when evaluating their possibility to provide feedback, this was not just interpreted in the sense of functionality of the system, but also the perceived pres-tige of the stakeholders of the systems, which in turn had implications for both the relationship between the central organization and employees and the functionality of the systems...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{continuing}} information explosion, many organizations are drowning in data and the resulting “data gap ” or inability to process this information and use it effectively is increasing at an alarming rate. Data-intensive computing represents a new computing paradigm which can address the data gap using scalable parallel processing and allow government and commercial organizations and research environments to process massive amounts of data and implement applications previously thought to be impractical or infeasible. The fundamental challenges of data-intensive computing are managing and processing exponentially growing data volumes, significantly reducing associated data analysis cycles to support practical, timely applications, and developing new algorithms which can scale to search and process massive amounts of data. LexisNexis believes that the answer to these challenges is a scalable, <b>integrated</b> <b>computer</b> <b>systems</b> hardware and software architecture designed for parallel processing of data-intensive computing applications. This paper explores the challenges of data-intensive computing and offers an in-depth comparison of commercially available system architectures including the LexisNexis Data Analytics Supercomputer (DAS) also referred to as the LexisNexis High-Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC), and Hadoop, an open source implementation of Google’s MapReduce architecture.
