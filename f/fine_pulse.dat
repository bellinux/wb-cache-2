60|$|IT IS {{difficult}} {{to describe the}} restlessness of Ferdinand Armine. His solitary dinner was an excuse for quitting Glastonbury: but to eat is as impossible as to sleep, {{for a man who}} is really in love. He took a spoonful of soup, and then jumping up from his chair, he walked up and down the room, thinking of Henrietta Temple. Then to-morrow occurred to him, and that other lady that to-morrow was to bring. He drowned the thought in a bumper of claret. Wine, mighty wine! thou best and surest consolation! What care can withstand thy inspiring influence! from what scrape canst thou not, for the moment, extricate the victim! Who can deny that our spiritual nature in some degree depends upon our corporeal condition? A man without breakfast is not a hero; a hero well fed is full of audacious invention. Everything depends upon the circulation. Let but the blood flow freely, and a man of imagination is never without resources. A <b>fine</b> <b>pulse</b> is a talisman; a charmed life; a balance at our bankers. It is good luck; it is eternity; it is wealth. Nothing can withstand us; nothing injure us; it is inexhaustible riches. So felt Ferdinand Armine, though {{on the verge of a}} moral precipice. To-morrow! what of to-morrow? Did to-morrow daunt him? Not a jot. He would wrestle with to-morrow, laden as it might be with curses, and dash it to the earth. It should not be a day; he would blot it out of the calendar of time; he would effect a moral eclipse of its influence. He loved Henrietta Temple. She should be his. Who could prevent him? Was he not an Armine? Was he not the near descendant of that bold man who passed his whole life in the voluptuous indulgence of his unrestrained volition! Bravo! he willed it, and it should be done. Everything yields to determination. What a fool! what a miserable craven fool had he been to have frightened himself with the flimsy shadows of petty worldly cares! He was born to follow his own pleasure; it was supreme; it was absolute; he was a despot; he set everything and everybody at defiance; and, filling a huge tumbler to the health of the great Sir Ferdinand, he retired, glorious as an emperor.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 As dams {{approach}} {{the end of}} their useful life, there is need to predict where and how accumulated sediment will move following their removal to estimate impacts on aquatic habitat and infrastructure. Flume studies suggest that sediment pulses disperse in place for most dams, but it is hypothesized that a low Froude number and relatively <b>fine</b> <b>pulse</b> grain size may characterize pulses that translate downstream. However, quantitative analyses of sediment pulse behavior have not been widely conducted in field settings. This research seeks to evaluate flume-derived hypotheses in field settings by 1) investigating whether dispersion or translation dominates pulse behavior observed in the field across a range of dam removal physiographies; and 2) evaluating whether Froude number, pulse material grain size, pulse size, and discharge can explain pulse behavior. Based on results from flume experiments, translation is hypothesized to dominate pulse behavior in cases of low Froude number, <b>fine</b> <b>pulse</b> material, small pulse size, and large peak discharge. We evaluate the ability to explain pulse behavior by Froude number, grain size, pulse size, and discharge by comparing quantified predictors to visual and quantitative measurements of sediment movement at four field sites. Changes in pulse volume are calculated from bathymetry data and provide evidence of translational movement at all four sites. The results observe that dispersion dominates pulse behavior except when the site is characterized by a Froude number {{less than or equal to}} 0. 4, and document a connection between translational behavior and wet water years...|$|E

To compare the pulse arrival times of different energy ranges, the fine orbital and spin parameters which reveal the correct pulse profiles are required. These parameters are refined through minimizing the variation of the pulse peak phases, which are yielded by folding the non-burst, 2 - 10 keV events with a model consisting of orbital Doppler Effect plus possible pulse phase drift described as a polynomial.

This suggests that even shorter micropulses may exist.

Signs and symptoms and biochemical information of patients were collected by using a self-designed questionnaire regarding the four examinations of TCM. Signs and symptoms were firstly analyzed to find the frequency of occurrence. Then, the patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to non-existent or existent sign and symptom and the correlations between the signs and symptoms which occurred most frequently and their biochemical parameters were analyzed. Results: Sixteen symptoms which occurred most frequently were fatigue, colored urine, liver palms, opaque complexion, string-like pulse, weakness at waist and knees, dry month and bitter taste in the mouth, profuse dreaminess and poor sleepiness, heaviness of limbs, abdominal distention, yellow eyes, <b>fine</b> <b>pulse,</b> impetuosity and susceptibility to rage, splenomegaly, poor appetite, and distension and fullness in the chest and hypochondrium. A previous study on syndrome differentiation of 900 patients with posthepatitic cirrhosis showed 4 syndrome patterns: internal accumulation of dampness-heat, liver-kidney yin deficiency, internal accumulation of blood stasis-heat, and liver depression and spleen deficiency. Further analysis showed that internal accumulation of dampness-heat syndrome was characterized by obvious hepatic inflammation, poor synthesis function and more asctites. Liver-kidney yin deficiency syndrome was characterized by low-level hepatic inflammation, poor synthesis function and more ascites. Internal accumulation of blood stasis-heat syndrome was characterized by low-level hepatic inflammation, poorer synthesis function, ascites and splenomegalia, and liver depression and spleen deficiency syndrome was characterized by slight hepatic inflammation, synthesis function injury, decreased internal portal vein diameter and less ascites.

40|$|Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) {{is a form}} {{of laser}} eye surgery used to correct vision. This {{procedure}} entails the precise removal of corneal tissue by laser ablation. It has been shown experimentally that dehydration of the corneal tissue leads to a higher dry mass ablation rate, which can lead to longer healing times and imprecise reshaping. In order to maximize surgical accuracy, {{it is important to know}} the relationship between tissue ablation rate and corneal hydration. Our model used the computational design software COMSOL 5. 1 to model corneal heat and hydration levels during a simulated PRK procedure. We simulated heat and mass transfer under the specified conditions of the eye and laser. Although simplifications must be made from reality, computer-aided modeling allows us to obtain approximate results difficult to obtain in vivo. Consequently, the theoretical corneal hydration after removal of the epithelium and during laser ablation heating can be visualized. This model will be useful alongside experimental trials for improving the success of laser eye surgeries. This model was validated and showed high levels of consistency with past work and other simulations of the cornea during similar procedures.

In this work, we present the results of spectroscopic investigations on new boron oxide encapsulated vertical Bridgman (B-VB) grown CZT detectors, recently developed at IMEM-CNR Parma, Italy. Several detectors, with the same electrode layout (gold electroless contacts) and different thicknesses (1 and 2. 5 mm), were realized: the cathode is a planar electrode covering the detector surface (4. 1 × 4. 1 mm 2), while the anode is a central electrode (2 × 2 mm 2) surrounded by a guard-ring electrode. The detectors are characterized by electron mobility-lifetime product (µeτe) values ranging between 0. 6 and 1 · 10 − 3 cm 2 /V and by low leakage currents at room temperature and at high bias voltages (38 nA/cm 2 at 10000 V/cm). The spectroscopic response of the detectors to monochromatic X-ray and gamma ray sources (109 Cd, 241 Am and 57 Co), at different temperatures and fluxes (up to 1 Mcps), was measured taking into account the mitigation of the effects of incomplete charge collection, pile-up and high flux radiation induced polarization phenomena. A custom-designed digital readout electronics, developed at DiFC of University of Palermo (Italy), able to perform a <b>fine</b> <b>pulse</b> shape and height analysis even at high fluxes, was used. At low rates (200 cps) and at room temperature (T= 25 °C), the detectors exhibit an energy resolution FWHM around 4 % at 59. 5 keV, for comparison an energy resolution of 3 % was measured with Al/CdTe/Pt detectors by using the same electronics (A 250 F/NF charge sensitive preamplifier, Amptek, USA; nominal ENC of 100 electrons RMS). At high rates (750 kcps), energy resolution values of 7 % and 9 % were measured, with throughputs of 2 % and 60 % respectively. No radiation polarization phenomena were observed at room temperature up to 1 Mcps (241 Am source, 60 keV), while a detector collapse characterizes the samples at T< 10 °C. Comparison with two traveling heater method (THM) grown CZT detectors (REDLEN, Canada), fabricated with the same electrode layout, is also presented.

The new results in this field [the electromagnetic (em) waves generation in {{the gap in the}} process of longitudinal acceleration in the electric field vanishing on the star surface, high frequency break in the spectrum as a result of switching off this generation, formation in this process a power-low spectrum with a high frequency (hf) break, the possibility determination of pulsar magnetic field by the hf break position, the difference between main pulse and inter pulse mechanism generation, quantization of em tornado rotation in the gap and appearance of the bands in the inter pulse spectrum, influence the high energy density in the gap on pair generation and position of the dead line in pulsars] are added in the intermediate epilogue.

It was what in these weeks he was living for--since he really felt life to begin but after Mrs. Muldoon had retired from the scene and, visiting the ample house from attic to cellar, making sure he was alone, he knew himself in safe possession and, as he tacitly expressed it, let himself go. He sometimes came twice in the twenty-four hours; the moments he liked best were those of gathering dusk, of the short autumn twilight; {{this was the time}} of which, again and again, he found himself hoping most. Then he could, as seemed to him, most intimately wander and wait, linger and listen, feel his fine attention, never in his life before so <b>fine,</b> on the <b>pulse</b> of the great vague place: he preferred the lampless hour and only wished he might have prolonged each day the deep crepuscular spell. Later--rarely much before midnight, but then for a considerable vigil--he watched with his glimmering light; moving slowly, holding it high, playing it far, rejoicing above all, as much as he might, in open vistas, reaches of communication between rooms and by passages; the long straight chance or show, as he would have called it, for the revelation he pretended to invite. It was a practice he found he could perfectly [...] "work" [...] without exciting remark; no one was in the least the wiser for it; even Alice Staverton, who was moreover a well of discretion, didn't quite fully imagine.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSediment supply {{from banks}} and {{terraces}} {{has important implications}} for grain-size distributions in alluvial rivers (and by extension for aquatic habitat), {{as well as for the}} delivery of floodplain-stored nutrients and contaminants to the aquatic environment. The interactions between streamflow hydrographs and lateral channel boundary failure control the sediment supply from banks and terraces. However, the relationships between variable flow and discrete sediment supply from catastrophic erosion of lateral boundaries and subsequent mass sediment flux in rivers are not well characterised by existing methods and models that focus only on one of several relevant interrelated processes. In order to improve predictive capability of catastrophic sediment supply from lateral boundaries, we adopt a new approach to modelling the process interactions between stream hydrology, erosion of banks/terraces, and the corresponding discrete supply of sediment to channels. We develop a modelling framework for terrace — channel coupling that combines existing theories of flow through porous media, bank stability, and fractional sediment flux. We demonstrate the utility of this modelling approach by assessing hydrologically driven erosion, evolution of grain size in the channel, and fine sediment flux from a study site along the Yuba River in California over individual flood hydrographs and over decadal historical flow series. We quantify the supply of sediment eroded from a contaminated nineteenth century fan terrace of hydraulic gold mining tailings intersecting the Yuba, and find that a threshold for erosion exists at a stage in the channel in excess of 8 m producing episodic sediment concentrations in excess of ~ 300 mgL− 1. The modelling produced erosion and <b>fine</b> sediment <b>pulses</b> from each of three major floods in the past several decades until the flow drops below 500 m 3 s− 1 and a bed armor layer forms, while no sediment was generated from the terrace during smaller floods. We further assess the impact on terrace erosion of various river management scenarios with distinct hydrograph shapes and find increased erosion potential when the terrace contains antecedent moisture or the flood time series is run over an extended duration. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that elevated antecedent moisture within the lateral boundary and increased hydrograph rising time each reduce bank stability and thus increase volumes of failed material. We also show that fluctuations in the hydrograph, typically associated with hydroelectricity generation, result in a more stable terrace than those of a longer duration because there is less time for hyporheic stream water to infiltrate the lateral boundary. This study demonstrates that changes in hydrograph shape as a consequence of climatic forcing or anthropogenic dam releases may have considerable impacts upon sediment delivery and associated contaminants from banks and terraces to the downstream environment...|$|R
