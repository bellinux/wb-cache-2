40|$|LTPD {{sampling}} plans minimizing the mean inspection cost per lot of pro-cess average quality when {{the remainder of}} rejected lots is inspected were originally designed for the <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> attributes. The single {{sampling plans}} for the <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> variables and for the <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> variables and attributes (all items from the sample are inspected by variables, remainder of rejected lots is inspected by attributes) were then proposed. Under the same protection of consumer the LTPD plans for <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> variables are in many situations more economical than the corresponding sampling plans for <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> attributes. Comparative efficiency of sampling plan for <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> variables and attributes can be assessed using a measure which has been proposed for this purpose...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we shall {{deal with the}} AOQL single {{sampling}} plans when the remainder of rejected lots is inspected. We shall consider two types of AOQL plans – for <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> variables, and for <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> variables and attributes (all items from the sample are inspected by variables, remainder of rejected lots is inspected by attributes) – see Klufa (1997). These plans we shall compare with the corresponding Dodge-Romig AOQL plans by attributes. From the results of numerical investigations it follows (see Klufa (2008)) that under the same protection of consumer the AOQL plans for <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> variables are in many situations more economical than the corresponding Dodge-Romig attribute sampling plans (saving of the inspection cost is 70 % in any cases). The calculation of these new plans is considerably difficult (in Klufa (2008) is only approximate solution). The problem of finding the optimal sampling plan for <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> variables we shall solve in this paper by original method...|$|R
