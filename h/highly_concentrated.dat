5|$|The addax are amply {{suited to}} live in the deep desert under extreme conditions.

Scientists believe the addax has a special lining in its stomach that stores water in pouches to use in times of dehydration. They also produce <b>highly</b> <b>concentrated</b> urine to conserve water. Pale colour of the coat reflects radiant heat, and the length and density of the coat helps in thermoregulation. In the day the addax huddle together in shaded areas, and in cool nights rest in sand hollows.

Cats have minimal ability to sweat, with glands located primarily in their paw pads, and pant for heat relief only at very high temperatures (but may also pant when stressed). A cat's body temperature does not vary throughout the day; this is part of cats' general lack of circadian rhythms and may reflect their tendency to be active both during the day and at night. Cats' feces are comparatively dry and their urine is <b>highly</b> <b>concentrated,</b> both of which are adaptations to allow cats to retain as much water as possible. Their kidneys are so efficient, they can survive on a diet consisting only of meat, with no additional water, and can even rehydrate by drinking seawater.

5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingomyelin and gangliosides are <b>highly</b> <b>concentrated</b> in {{the brain}} and support synaptogenesis and myelination. In the central nervous system, sphingomyelin is a key component of the myelin sheath, which insulates axons and supports efficient transmission of nerve impulses. During myelination, nerve axons are wrapped with multiple layers of cell membrane by oligodendrocyte glial cells, a process that accounts for a large portion of brain growth during late gestation and {{the first two years of}} life, but which can also continue up to 5–10 years of age. Meanwhile, gangliosides are concentrated with{{in the brain}}’s gray matter and constitute approximately 6% to 10% of the total human brain lipid mass. Additionally, gangliosides are enriched at the synaptic membrane of neurons, and are functionally involved in neurotransmission and synapse formation. Brain ganglioside accretion occurs at an accelerated rate in the early years of life, coinciding with the most active period of myelination, axonal outgrowth, and synaptogenesis.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} forty years, {{there has been}} a {{remarkable}} transformation in horizontal merger enforcement in the United States.

40|$|Rapid development, a {{widening}} regional gap, and growing concentration of activities have characterized the Chinese economy since the {{reforms in the}} late 1970 s. This paper examines the spatial disparities of the economic concentration in different stages of development from a geographic approach {{in the case of}} China. It aims at offering empirical supports on (1) how concentrated the economic activities are; (2) what factors determine the economic concentration; and (3) whether this concentration differs in the coastal and inland regions. The results show that the high-technology industries <b>highly</b> <b>concentrate</b> in the coastal provinces. The limited diffusion of the labor intensive activities within the coastal region does not significantly modify the major trend of the location and specialization of the industries in the inland region, and does not contribute to narrowing the regional disparities. The paper argues that in order to stimulate the geographic diffusion of economic activities to the inland region, it is important to appropriately alleviate internal migration control, reduce unnecessary state intervention, and further encourage domestic market integration.

40|$|Heterochromatic {{chromosomal}} regions undergo large-scale reorganization and progressively aggregate, forming chromo-centers. These are dynamic {{structures that}} rapidly adapt to various stimuli that influence gene expression patterns, cell cycle progression, and differentiation. Np 95 -ICBP 90 (m- and h-UHRF 1) is a histone-binding protein expressed only in proliferating cells. During pericentromeric heterochromatin (PH) replication, Np 95 specifically relocalizes to chromo-centers where it <b>highly</b> <b>concentrates</b> in the replication factories {{that correspond to}} less compacted DNA. Np 95 recruits HDAC and DNMT 1 to PH and depletion of Np 95 impairs PH replication. Here we show that Np 95 causes large-scale modifications of chromocenters independently from the H 3 :K 9 and H 4 :K 20 trimethylation pathways, from the expression levels of HP 1, from DNA methylation and from the cell cycle. The PHD domain is essential to induce this effect. The PHD domain is also required in vitro to increase access of a restriction enzyme to DNA packaged into nucleosomal arrays. We propose that the PHD domain of Np 95 -ICBP 90 contributes to the opening and/or stabilization of dense chromocente...|$|R

5|$|Group 12 metals are chalcophiles, {{meaning the}} {{elements}} have low affinities for oxides and prefer {{to bond with}} sulfides. Chalcophiles formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions of the early Earth's atmosphere. The commercially most important minerals of group 12 elements are sulfide minerals. Sphalerite, which {{is a form of}} zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60–62% zinc. No significant deposits of cadmium-containing ores are known. Greenockite (CdS), the only cadmium mineral of importance, is nearly always associated with sphalerite (ZnS). This association is caused by the geochemical similarity between zinc and cadmium which makes geological separation unlikely. As a consequence, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct from mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and, to a lesser degree, lead and copper. One place where metallic cadmium can be found is the Vilyuy River basin in Siberia. Although mercury is an extremely rare element in the Earth's crust, because it does not blend geochemically with those elements that constitute the majority of the crustal mass, mercury ores can be <b>highly</b> <b>concentrated</b> considering the element's abundance in ordinary rock. The richest mercury ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury (12,000 times average crustal abundance).

The experimental results show that highest photovoltaic efficiency of 30 % and instantaneous thermal efficiency of 30 % can be achieved at the same time, which means the total solar energy conversion efficiency of the HCPV/T system is higher than 60 %. The photovoltaic efficiency increases with direct irradiance when the direct irradiance is below 580 [*]W/m 2, but it remains nearly unchanged when the direct irradiation is higher than 580 [*]W/m 2. The instantaneous thermal efficiency decreases during water heating process. However, the electrical performance of the system is not affected obviously by water temperature.

Microtubules can be functionalized to provide numerous, nanoscopic binding sites for specific target biomolecules. The functionalized microtubules, with the target biomolecules bound to their surface, can be transported {{in the opposite direction}} to nontarget molecules using electrokinetic separation. Subsequently, the target molecule-bound microtubules are concentrated by a flat nanochannel structure, which filters the microtubules but allows ionic current and flow to pass through it. This device makes it possible to selectively extract target molecules such as streptavidin and bovine serum albumin and then <b>highly</b> <b>concentrate</b> them up to higher than 5 orders of magnitude from a complex mixture of analytes ranging from 1 nM to 10 fM. In addition, the device performs both extraction (separation) and concentration process simultaneously, which are typically performed in order in other devices, so that we significantly reduce analysis time and labor and even enable preconcentrated, identified target molecules to be available for postanalysis. Thus, we believe that the use of functionalized microtubules with nanofluidics will be a useful means to facilitate biochemical analysis systems. close 202...|$|R
