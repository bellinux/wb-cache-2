5|$|According to Human Rights Watch, Noreen's {{situation}} is not unusual. Though {{no one has been}} executed for blasphemy yet in Pakistan, the accused often remain imprisoned for an extensive amount of time while the case is being processed.

The {{ceremony}} had been <b>delayed</b> <b>for</b> a weekend, as the 2001 anthrax attacks {{had led to}} a shutdown of Congressional office buildings. In a press conference after his swearing-in, Lynch remarked on the unlikelihood of his career path, comparing himself to Jed Clampett of The Beverly Hillbillies.|$|E

5|$|Kony 2012: Part II– Beyond Famous is a 20-minute video {{follow-up}} to Kony 2012. The film was announced early on April 2, 2012, {{to be released}} within the week. It was initially announced to be released on April 3, but was <b>delayed</b> <b>for</b> two days due to editing problems.|$|E
5|$|Production and {{planning}} {{of the film}} began in 1931 and Paramount expected the film to be released that same year. However, due to a film stock crisis in {{which most of the}} location footage deteriorated due to the high temperatures, the project was <b>delayed</b> <b>for</b> four years. The motion picture was released in American cinemas in January 1935.|$|E
5|$|Redevelopment of the O Street Market was <b>delayed</b> <b>for</b> {{two years}} as the {{developers}} sought {{to meet the demands}} imposed by the Historic Preservation Review Board.

30|$|The {{probability}} values {{reported in}} Table  2 calculated <b>for</b> 10 <b>delay</b> show that linearity is rejected more {{strongly in the}} second <b>delay</b> <b>for</b> INF and OIL, in the third <b>delay</b> <b>for</b> DGAS, and in the fourth <b>delay</b> <b>for</b> CINF. Afterward, an LR test is made {{in order to determine}} the number of regimes of the models, which is the first stage of model selection. Subsequently, the linear VAR model is tested against the 2 -regime MS-VAR model. And later the 2 -regime MS-VAR model is tested against the 3 -regime MS-VAR model.|$|R
30|$|Next, {{from the}} result of f = 200 kHz, the <b>delay</b> <b>for</b> each profile {{is in the same}} order as that of 100 kHz for 13 ° <η whereas the <b>delays</b> <b>for</b> Profile 0 and 1 are counterchanged for η < 13 °. Although the plasma {{frequency}} is 200 kHz at 20 km in both Profile 0 and 1, the <b>delay</b> <b>for</b> Profile 1 is longer than that for Profile 0 for η ∼ 0 °. This is because the group refractive index for Profile 1 is larger than that for Profile 0 above 20 km. For oblique incidence, however, the reflection altitude for Profile 1 is higher than that for Profile 0, in accordance with Snell’s law. Thus, the <b>delay</b> <b>for</b> Profile 0 is longer than Profile 1 for large η. Because the peak plasma frequency for Profile 2 is not higher than 200 kHz, the wave is considered to reach the lunar surface for η ∼ 0 °. The <b>delay</b> <b>for</b> Profile 2, however, does not agree with that for Profile 3, even when η = 0 °.|$|R

Besides the main performers, the musicians and singers on the recording include Badfinger, Jim Horn, Klaus Voormann, Alla Rakha, Jim Keltner, Jesse Ed Davis and Claudia Linnear. The box set's original packaging included a 64-page book containing photos from the concerts; the album cover, designed by Tom Wilkes, consisted of {{an image of a}} malnourished child sitting beside an empty food bowl.|$|E
5|$|Ellen Southard plied {{international}} trade routes from her homeport in Bath, Maine, with visits documented in ports {{as far away}} as Sydney, Australia. In 1864, she recorded the longest duration voyage of any ship transporting railway locomotives from the east to the west coast of the United States. The ship took 205 days to complete the passage after she was <b>delayed</b> <b>for</b> 48 days by unfavourable winds off Cape Horn.|$|E
5|$|Euell {{was taken}} to a {{hospital}} and died about an hour after the shooting. He was never able to formally identify Shay as the shooter. When Shay was arrested in his hotel room that night, police officers said that he appeared to be intoxicated. He refused to make any statements. He was held without bail and charged with second-degree murder. A conviction carried the possibility of life imprisonment. A few days after the shooting, American Association owners began to collect funds to assist in Shay's criminal defense. As the case was about to go to trial, one of the attorneys became ill, so the proceedings were <b>delayed</b> <b>for</b> several weeks. The trial was reset for November 12, 1917.|$|E

5|$|Fairley {{travelled}} to New Guinea {{at the end}} of June 1943 {{and arranged}} for Plasmodium falciparum cases to be evacuated to Cairns for treatment. As the flight time from Port Moresby to Cairns was only a few hours, this was considered safe, but since the disease can be fatal if not treated promptly, Fairley was concerned lest the cases be <b>delayed</b> <b>for</b> some reason. Movement Control suggested that a special priority be allocated to such cases, and Major General Frank Berryman suggested calling it priority Neil after Fairley himself. Because movement priorities had to have five letters, an extra L was added on the end. Priority Neill soon came to be applied to the entire Cairns project.|$|E
5|$|Following Walker's death, alumni and {{students}} began {{to raise funds}} to construct a monument {{to him and his}} fifteen years as leader of the university. Although the funds were easily raised, plans were <b>delayed</b> <b>for</b> over two decades as MIT made plans to move to a new campus on the western bank of the Charles River in Cambridge. The new Beaux-Arts campus opened in 1916, and featured a neo-classical Walker Memorial building housing a gymnasium, students' club and lounge, and a commons room.|$|E
5|$|For 2011, Robson hired a new coach, Frenchman Patrick Mouratoglou, {{and moved}} her working base to Paris.

Returning again at the end of April 2011, Robson's best performance to date came at the $50,000 tournament at Indian Harbor Beach, Florida, where she reached the semifinal. Robson split from Mouratoglou just before Wimbledon. Robson then won her first match at a Grand Slam as she defeated Angelique Kerber, but lost to Maria Sharapova in the second round.|$|E
