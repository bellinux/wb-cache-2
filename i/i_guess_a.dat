[...] "I {{always get}} {{frustrated}} when I see {{a link to}} this site on some hipster’s blog with a tagline like 'taking {{it back to the}} old school', when I very rarely post anything recorded before 1989. I mean, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>a</b> lot of what I post here is old, but that don’t make it old school, yaoming? Like how you gonna call Leaders of the New School old school?"—Noz, [...] "Lady Don’t Tek No Beat", Cocaine Blunts and Hip Hop Tapes, January 10, 2005.|$|E
500|$|I {{happened}} to be at Cambridge. I was sent there by the [...] government on a government grant. And I'd read some of Ted's poems in this magazine and I was very impressed and I wanted to meet him. I went to this little celebration and that's actually where we met... Then we saw {{a great deal of}} each other. Ted came back to Cambridge and suddenly we found ourselves getting married a few months later... We kept writing poems to each other. Then it just grew out of that, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>a</b> feeling that we both were writing so much and having such a fine time doing it, we decided that this should keep on.|$|E
500|$|Brother, {{remember}} the time that white college girl came into the restaurantthe one who wanted to help the [...] Muslims and the whites get togetherand I told her there wasn't a ghost of a chance and she went away crying? Well, I've lived to regret that incident. In {{many parts of the}} African continent I saw white students helping black people. Something like this kills a lot of argument. I did many things as a [...] Muslim that I'm sorry for now. I was a zombie thenlike all [...] MuslimsI was hypnotized, pointed in a certain direction and told to march. Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>a</b> man's entitled to make a fool of himself if he's ready to pay the cost. It cost me 12 years.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{director}} and co-writer Cory Edwards {{was surprised by}} Sexton's interpretation and denied that the film intentionally carried any political messages. He explained {{that he and the}} other filmmakers were simply drawing from the evil schemes common of James Bond films, Bugs Bunny cartoons, and The A-Team, and wrote [...] "If Mr. Sexton sees my movie as a sermon against mega-corporations monopolizing America, that's fine. But our villain is just as easily the face of every dictator in history, or every schoolyard bully who is compensating for low self-esteem, or any Mafia boss who dominates by either absorbing or wiping out his competition. Hey, if you look at an abstract painting and see the devil in a red splotch, that's your prerogative... <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>a</b> movie's message is only partially supplied by the filmmaker." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} its sexually {{explicit}} nature, the singer responded: [...] "Erm, yeah. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>a</b> {{part of me}} wanted to be truthful {{about what it is}} that really drives me, and maybe give back to the place that is nourishing me... I don't know what to say. When I read books or see films or listen to albums I want certain things. I want a heart—I'm very old school like that, I'm very emotional... I just didn't want anybody to know. I wanted it for myself. The lyric to 'Cocoon' was a whole diary, then I had to edit 90 per cent of it out. It's very hard to explain, but when I read it and the other person it's about reads it, we don't feel abused or anything. I think there's songs where I've been more... scruffy about what I'm expressing. I have a problem with music that's too indulgent. It's like 'Keep your own dirty laundry, please'".|$|E
500|$|... "The Return of Harmony" [...] was {{the first}} episode of the second season. According to Thiessen, the Hub and its parent company Hasbro had [...] "approved the season two before we were done with season one; {{they knew they had}} {{something}} good on their hands." [...] He explained, [...] "they saw [...] of the show early on, which is [...] rare because usually a season will be one and aired before a network will renew it because {{they want to know what}} the numbers are, but they, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>a</b> bit of a risk on their behalf, but I'm glad they did." [...] The finale scene of the episode is a parody of the ending from the 1977 movie [...] According to Thiessen, the joke was an [...] "afterthought"; originally, there was going to be a more elaborate ending, but due to time constraints, a new finale was created. During the animation stage, one of the directors noted that the scene was [...] "kind of like the ending to A New Hope" [...] and so, the decision was made to create [...] "scene for scene" [...] parody of the original.|$|E

500|$|In April 1997, {{the band}} convened at Buck's Kauai {{vacation}} home to record demos of material {{intended for the}} next album. The band sought to reinvent its sound and intended to incorporate drum loops and percussion experiments. Just as the sessions were due to begin in October, Berry decided, after months of contemplation and discussions with Downs and Mills, to tell {{the rest of the}} band that he was quitting. Berry told his bandmates that he would not quit if they would break up as a result, so Stipe, Buck, and Mills agreed to carry on as a three-piece with his blessing. Berry publicly announced his departure three weeks later in October 1997. Berry told the press, [...] "I'm just not as enthusiastic as I {{have been in the past}} about doing this anymore [...] [...] [...] I have the best job in the world. But I'm kind of ready to sit back and reflect and maybe not be a pop star anymore." [...] Stipe admitted that the band would be different without a major contributor: [...] "For me, Mike, and Peter, as R.E.M., are we still R.E.M.? <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>a</b> three-legged dog is still a dog. It just has to learn to run differently." ...|$|E
2500|$|When first released, [...] "Brand New Key" [...] {{was banned}} by some radio {{stations}} because some heard sexual innuendo in the lyrics. Melanie has acknowledged {{the possibility of}} reading an unintended sexual innuendo in the song, stating, [...] "I wrote [...] in about fifteen minutes one night. I thought it was cute; a kind of old thirties tune. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>a</b> key and a lock have always been Freudian symbols, and pretty obvious ones at that. There was no deep serious expression behind the song, but people read things into it. They made up incredible stories {{as to what the}} lyrics said and what the song meant. In some places, it was even banned from the radio [...] My idea about songs is that once you write them, you have very little say in their life afterward [...] People will take it any way they want to take it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> we'll {{wait for}} the {{official}} count, first. Even New York hasn't gone against us, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> there's <b>a</b> majority coming down to Harlem River that could sweep everything before it, anyway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Our benefactor’s. Mrs. Westgate. What’s his name? J. L. It ‘kind of’ {{sounds like}} <b>a</b> number. But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it’s <b>a</b> high number,” he {{continued}} with freshened gaiety.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it's <b>a</b> {{good chance}} to give Mr. Dryfoos {{an idea of what}} we've really done--just while we're resting, as Artemus Ward says. Heigh, March?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{feels that}} kind of thing, of course; but it wasn't an animal I'd get {{attached}} to. Hard in the mouth, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>a</b> bad buck-jumper, and a wicked eye. On the whole, you're better off without him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{they say}} 'dirty work makes clean money,'" [...] cried Randy. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of these}} men don't care how much they muss up the scenery and muss up {{themselves}} {{so long as they}} get good fat bank accounts out of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>a</b> {{few things}} will happen before that," [...] said Harvey shrugging his shoulders. [...] "The British navy {{would have to be}} licked for one; and for another, Miller here, now, and I, we'd raise a dust, wouldn't we, Miller? No Germans need apply for this old country, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "More {{fool you}} to come, then," [...] she said, shortly. [...] "You don't look like <b>a</b> Cockney. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you're <b>a</b> gentleman, aren't you--run {{away from home}} or something?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very little, but <b>I</b> can <b>guess</b> <b>a</b> good deal. Quite enough, anyway, to {{convince}} me that you folks had better lie quiet, and let the boys alone." ...|$|R

6000|$|Another time {{he asked}} for certain accounts, and after {{studying}} them remarked: [...] "You want to watch the business and run it all it's worth. You have a husband to work for now, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>a</b> man like Bob comes expensive. Still, if you can guild him right, he's not all a fool." ...|$|E
6000|$|Harry laughed. [...] "If she {{has come}} down from Seattle they'd get plenty {{cordwood}} or, if they wanted it, stove coal there, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>a</b> skipper wouldn't waste a fair wind like this one to save two or three dollars. The thing's mighty curious. That vessel's been seen twice, anyway, and nobody seems to know where she comes from or where she goes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal, stranger," [...] said Waller, who, having {{finished}} eating, {{wiped his}} mouth with a tuft of grass, and began to fill his pipe. [...] "You do {{come out in the}} way o' moderation rather powerful. Why a teal duck an' a ven'son steak is barely enough to stop a feller dyin' right off. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>a</b> down-east baby o' six months old 'ud swab up that an' axe for more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A raccoon, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> or <b>a</b> big woodchuck. Won't his fur make <b>a</b> fine cap? <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> {{the other}} fellows will wish they'd come with us," [...] said Tommy, prancing to and fro, without the least {{idea what to}} do with the creature.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess he}} is on a walkin' tour," [...] said Matlack, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> he's <b>a</b> regular tramp, and there's no orders we've got that's stricter than them against tramps." ...|$|R

"I promised Mary I'd do my {{best for}} the poor baby she had to leave, and I tried; but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>a</b> better friend than I am has been raised up {{for him when he}} needed her most.

6000|$|... "Well, that's your business, I suppose. But I can't {{get away}} with it. Besides that--way I figure it, this illicit love-making is the one game that you always lose at. If you do lose, you feel foolish; and if you win, {{as soon as you}} find out how little it is that you've been scheming for, why then you lose worse than ever. Nature {{stinging}} us, as usual. But at that, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>a</b> lot of wives in this burg would be surprised if they knew everything that goes on behind their backs, eh, Nattie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't think I'm crazy neither," [...] resumed Davis. [...] "I've all {{the cold}} sense that I {{know what to}} do with. But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>a</b> man that's unhappy's like a child; and {{this is a kind of}} a child's game of mine. I never could act up to the plain-cut truth, you see; so I pretend. And I warn you square; as soon as we're through with this talk, I'll start in again with the pretending.
