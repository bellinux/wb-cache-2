5|$|As {{the planet}} is not known to transit from Earth and {{atmospheric}} conditions are not observable with current technology, no atmosphere for the planet <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>confirmed</b> to date. As such, all climate predictions for the planet are based on predicted orbits and computer modelling of theoretical atmospheric conditions.|$|E

5|$|Formation of the {{complexes}} of {{the type}} Am(n-C3H7-BTP)3, where BTP stands for 2,6-di(1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)pyridine, in solutions containing n-C3H7-BTP and Am3+ ions <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>confirmed</b> by EXAFS. Some of these BTP-type complexes selectively interact with americium and therefore are useful in its selective separation from lanthanides and another actinides.|$|E
5|$|Italy: M.alcathoe {{has been}} {{recorded}} in beech forest in Majella National Park {{in the region of}} Abruzzo. Additional specimens of M.alcathoe have been identified in Italy using molecular methods.

5|$|A few ASD {{cases have}} been linked to {{exposure}} to teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) during the first eight weeks from conception. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development. Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>confirmed</b> by scientific investigation.|$|E
5|$|A pulse with {{different}} group and phase velocities (which occurs if the phase velocity {{is not the}} same for all the frequencies of the pulse) smears out over time, a process known as dispersion. Certain materials have an exceptionally low (or even zero) group velocity for light waves, a phenomenon called slow light, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>confirmed</b> in various experiments.|$|E
5|$|At the December 2016 PlayStation Experience event, {{a sequel}} titled The Last of Us Part II was {{announced}} {{as being in}} early development.

5|$|If the {{large-scale}} universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle {{can be derived}} from the simpler Copernican principle, which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>confirmed</b> to a level of 10−5 via observations of the CMB. The universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} {{that a variety of}} {{different}} coins were minted by Edmund's moneyers during his reign. The letters AN, standing for 'Anglia', only appear on the coins of Edmund and Æthelstan of East Anglia: they appear on Edmund's coins as part of the phrase + EADMUND REX AN. Later specimens read + EADMUND REX and so it is possible for his coins to be divided chronologically. Otherwise, no chronology for his coins <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>confirmed.</b>|$|E

5|$|Rhodocene {{itself is}} then formed by {{reduction}} of rhodocenium salts with molten sodium. If a rhodocenium containing melt is treated with sodium or potassium metals and then sublimed onto a liquid nitrogen-cooled cold finger, a black polycrystalline material results. Warming this material to room temperature produces a yellow solid which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>confirmed</b> as the rhodocene dimer. A similar method {{can be used to}} prepare the iridocene dimer.|$|E
5|$|The Voyager 2 {{spacecraft}} {{observed a}} strange {{signal from the}} ε ring during the radio occultation experiment. The signal looked like a strong enhancement of the forward-scattering at the wavelength 3.6cm near ring’s apoapsis. Such strong scattering requires {{the existence of a}} coherent structure. That the ε ring does have such a fine structure <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>confirmed</b> by many occultation observations. The ε ring seems to consist of a number of narrow and optically dense ringlets, some of which may have incomplete arcs.|$|E

Many of the ancient city's olive presses, columbaria and water cisterns can still be seen. Less than 10 percent of the caves on Tel Maresha have been excavated.|$|E
5|$|The sister species {{relationship}} between the longfin and shortfin makos <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>confirmed</b> by several phylogenetic studies based on mitochondrial DNA. In turn, the closest relative of the two mako sharks is the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). Fossil teeth belonging to the longfin mako have been recovered from the Muddy Creek marl of the Grange Burn formation, south of Hamilton, Australia, and from Mizumani Group in Gifu Prefecture, Japan. Both deposits date to the Middle Miocene epoch (15–11 million years ago (Mya).|$|E
5|$|As time passes, Woodroof shows {{compassion}} towards gay, lesbian, and transgender {{members of}} the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority is provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in 1987 he files {{a lawsuit against the}} FDA. He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>confirmed</b> as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the legal tools to do anything. As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.|$|E
