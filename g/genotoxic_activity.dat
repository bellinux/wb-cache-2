40|$|Abstract Background The dibenzylbutyrolactone lignan (−) -hinokinin (HK) {{was derived}} by partial {{synthesis}} from (−) -cubebin, {{isolated from the}} dry seeds of the pepper, Piper cubeba. Considering the good trypanosomicidal activity of HK and recalling that natural products are promising starting points for the discovery of novel potentially therapeutic agents, {{the aim of the}} present study was to investigate the (anti) mutagenic∕ <b>genotoxic</b> <b>activities</b> of HK. Methods The mutagenic∕ <b>genotoxic</b> <b>activities</b> were evaluated by the Ames test on Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98, TA 97 a, TA 100 and TA 102, and the comet assay, so as to assess the safe use of HK in the treatment of Chagas’ disease. The antimutagenic ∕antigenotoxic potential of HK were also tested against the mutagenicity of a variety of direct and indirect acting mutagens, such as 4 - nitro- o -phenylenediamine (NOPD), sodium azide (SA), mitomycin C (MMC), benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1), 2 -aminoanthracene (2 -AA) and 2 -aminofluorene (2 -AF), by the Ames test, and doxorubicin (DXR) by the comet assay. Results The mutagenicity∕genotoxicity tests showed that HK did not induce any increase in the number of revertants or extent of DNA damage, demonstrating the absence of mutagenic and <b>genotoxic</b> <b>activities.</b> On the other hand, the results on the antimutagenic potential of HK showed a strong inhibitory effect against some direct and indirect-acting mutagens. Conclusions Regarding the use of HK as an antichagasic drug, the absence of mutagenic effects in animal cell and bacterial systems is encouraging. In addition, HK may be a new potential antigenotoxic ∕ antimutagenic agent from natural sources. However, the protective activity of HK is not general and varies with the type of DNA damage-inducing agent used. </p...|$|R
50|$|The risk {{of cancer}} {{associated}} with alcohol consumption is higher in tissues in closest contact on ingestion of alcohol, such as the oral cavity, pharynx and esophagus. This is {{explained by the fact}} that ethanol is a proven mutagen and in addition, metabolite of ethanol (acetaldehyde) produced in the liver is highly carcinogenic, thus explaining both local (mouth, throat, esophageal cancers) as well as distant (skin, liver, breast) cancers. It is well known that ethanol causes cell death at the concentrations present in alcoholic beverages. Few cells survive a one-hour exposure to 5-10% ethanol or a 15-second exposure to 30-40% ethanol in cell culture, where surviving cells might undergo genomic changes leading to carcinogenesis. But recent evidence suggests that the cytotoxic effect of ethanol on the cells lining the oral cavity, pharynx and esophagus activates the division of the stem cells located in deeper layers of the mucosa to replace the dead cells. Every time stem cells divide, they become exposed to unavoidable errors associated with cell division (e.g., mutations arising during DNA replication and chromosomal alterations occurring during mitosis) and also become highly vulnerable to the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>activity</b> of DNA-damaging agents (e.g., acetaldehyde and tobacco carcinogens). Alcohol consumption probably increases the risk of developing cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx and esophagus by promoting the accumulation of cell divisions in the stem cells that maintain these tissues in homeostasis. Because the cytotoxic activity of ethanol is concentration-dependent, the risk of these cancers will not only increase with increasing amounts of ethanol, but also with increasing concentrations; an ounce of whisky is probably more carcinogenic when taken undiluted than when taken mixed with non-alcoholic beverages. The local cytotoxic effect of ethanol may also explain the known synergistic effect of alcohol and tobacco use on the risk of these cancers.|$|E
40|$|Epidemiological {{evidence}} associating {{consumption of}} red wine with an increase of this incidence of gastric cancer compelled us to study the genotoxicity of this product, since data published in the scientific literature does not clearly identify the nature and origin of the compounds responsible for this genotoxicity. The results we obtained, discussed in chapter two, show that the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>activity</b> observed in the Aimes test due {{to the presence of}} quercetin and its glycosides, and the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>activity</b> of the final product is dependent on the vinification process. The <b>genotoxic</b> <b>activity</b> of quercetin in the Ames test, is increased by the addiction of S 9 and if S 100. Metabolization of this compound by each one of this fractions seems to produce different products reactive towards DNA. On the other hand, at pH values slightly higher than neutrality, this molecule auto oxidizes, producing various reactive oxygen species (O_ 2 "-, H_ 2 O_ 2 e OH.), which are responsible for the induction of breaks in plasmatic DNA in vitro. Apart from the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>activity</b> {{of red wine}}, due to its content in quercetin, we observed that red and wine wines were also genotoxic after reacting with the nitrite ion at acid pH values. Some of the precursors responsible for that activity were identified (Malvidine- 3 -glycoside, quercetin and tyramine). Flavonoids are present in a great variety of the vegetable products used in the human diet.

Potentially bioavailable contaminants in sediments were obtained using sediment extraction with synthetic seawater adjusted to pH 4 or pH 6, simulating the range of pH prevailing in the digestive tract of benthic organisms. The <b>genotoxic</b> <b>activities</b> of these extracts were evaluated by three short-term bioassays: the Salmonella mutagenicity test using the Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 102, the alkaline comet assay and the micronucleus assay on the Chinese Hamster Ovary cells CHO-K 1. Results of the Salmonella mutagenicity assay detected a mutagenic response for RN extract at pH 6, and for VA extract at pH 4. Results of the comet and micronucleus assays detected low genotoxic/clastogenic activities for VA and VC extracts at pH 6 and higher activities for RN. VA and VC extracts at pH 4. To identify if metals (Al, Fe, Mn, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn) were involved in these <b>genotoxic</b> <b>activities,</b> their concentrations were determined in the extracts, and their speciation was assessed by thermodynamic calculations. Results showed that extracts from sites VA. VC and VN generally presented the highest trace metal contents for both extractants, while the site RN presented lower trace metal contents but the highest Fe and Mn contents. Thermodynamic calculations indicated that Fe, Mn, As and in a lower extend Co, Ni and Zn were mainly present under free forms in extracts, and were consequently, more likely able to induce a genotoxic effect. Results globally showed no correspondence between free metal contents and <b>genotoxic</b> <b>activities.</b> They suggested that these positive results {{could be due to}} uncharacterized compounds, acting as direct genotoxic agents or enhancing the genotoxic properties of analyzed metals.

ANL at higher dose of 50 mg/ml induced potent cytotoxicity as no mitotic cell was found. Interestingly, metaphase chromosomes undergoing tetraploidization were found from ANL treatment at 12. 5 and 25 mg/ml. These indicate that ANL treatment could interrupt cell cycle that progressed after S phase. Therefore, the optimum dose of ANL as food supplement needs to be considered carefully for human safety. Nevertheless, ANL at doses lower than 3. 1 mg/ml mightbe useful for treatment of human hyperproliferative disorder at appropriate dose since ANL could induce temporary cytotoxicitywithout genotoxicity. Scientific study is also needed to verify the usefulness of an aqueous extract of Noni’s leaf...|$|R
40|$|Glyphosate {{is noted}} for being {{non-toxic}} in fishes, {{birds and mammals}} (including humans). Nevertheless, the degree of genotoxicity is seriously controversial. In this work, various concentrations of a glyphosate isopropylamine salt were tested using two methods of genotoxicity assaying, viz., the pink mutation assay with Tradescantia (4430) and the comet assay with nuclei from staminal cells of the same plant. Staminal nuclei were studied in two different forms, namely nuclei from exposed plants, and nuclei exposed directly. Using the pink mutation assay, isopropylamine induced a total or partial loss of color in staminal cells, a fundamental criterion utilized in this test. Consequently, its use is not recommended when studying genotoxicity with agents that produce pallid staminal cells. The comet assay system detected statistically significant (p < 0. 01) <b>genotoxic</b> <b>activity</b> by isopropylamine, {{when compared to the}} negative control in both the nuclei of treated plants and directly treated nuclei, but only the treated nuclei showed a dose-dependent increase. Average migration in the nuclei of treated plants increased, when compared to that in treated nuclei. This was probably due, either to the permanence of isopropylamine in inflorescences, or to the presence of secondary metabolites. In conclusion, isopropylamine possesses strong <b>genotoxic</b> <b>activity,</b> but its detection can vary depending on the test systems used...|$|E

The sediment of the Urakami river, which wastewater treatment plant (WTP) effluent flow in, indicated <b>genotoxic</b> <b>activity.</b> The river water of the same site also indicated genotoxicity. Comparing the values per unit weight, the genotoxicity of the sediment was 33 {{times higher than the}} river water.

40|$|A single {{administration}} of the sex-dependent hepatocarcinogenic beta-blocker DL- 1 -(2 -nitro- 3 -methyl-phenoxy) 3 -tert-butylamino-propan- 2 -ol (DL-ZAMI 1305) induces liver DNA damage, as evaluated by alkaline sucrose gradient analysis, in female but not in male Fisher 344 rats. The shift of the methyl-group from the 3 -position of the aromatic ring of DL-ZAMI 1305 to the 4 - and 5 -position causes the progressive decrease of the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>activity</b> of the molecule. No effect on the DNA-damaging capacity of DL-ZAMI 1305 is instead observed when the NO 2 group of the aromatic ring is reduced to an NH 2 group. Bis-demethylation of the side chain of DL-ZAMI 1305, or its modification to an alpha-hydroxicarboxylic acid or glycol, increases the DNA-damaging capacity of the molecule, which becomes genotoxic also for the liver of the male rat. Thus, modifications of the chemical structure of the aromatic ring or of the side chain of DL-ZAMI 1305 affect the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>activity</b> of the molecule both in male and female rat liver. The modifications of the side chain of DL-ZAMI 1305 investigated in the present work are {{likely to occur in}} vivo {{as a consequence of the}} hepatic metabolism of the molecule. Sex-dependent differences in the activity of the liver drug-metabolizing system might explain the different genotoxic and oncogenic activity of DL-ZAMI 1305 in the two sexes...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} neurobehavioral and <b>genotoxic</b> <b>activities</b> of ethanol extract of Erythrina falcata Benth., Fabaceae, leaves on rats. Animals were treated with ethanol extract of E. falcata (100, 300 or 500 mg/ kg; i. p.) and the open field and elevated plus-maze tasks were used as behavioral models to investigate a possible effect on the locomotor and exploratory activity and anxiety, respectively. Genotoxic effect was investigated using the Comet assay. Ethanol extract of E. falcata leaves decreased the number of crossings and rearings in the open field task and increased the latency to start locomotion, though it was not able to affect habituation to apparatus measured 24 h after the first session. Behavioral parameters in the plus-maze test were not affected by E. falcata. Ethanol extract did not increase damage index and damage frequency in blood or brain, indicating no genotoxic effect. The results suggest that ethanol extract of E. falcata leaves was able to affect locomotion, exploration, and motivation of animals without anxiolytic/anxiogenic effect, indicating a possible depressant action on the central nervous system. Furthermore, the lack of DNA damage in brain is an indicative that ethanol extract of E. falcata leaves may not induce neurotoxic effects...|$|R
40|$|WWTP (wastewater {{treatment}} plant) effluents {{are considered}} to be a major source for the release in the aquatic environment of EDCs (Endocrine-Disrupting Compounds), a group of anthropogenic substances able to alter the normal function of the endocrine system. The application of conventional processes (e. g. activated sludge with biological nitrogen removal) does not provide complete elimination of all these micropollutants and, consequently, an advanced treatment should be implemented. This experimental work was conducted on the tertiary ozonation stage of a 140, 000 p. e. activated sludge WWTP, treating a mixed domestic and textile wastewater: an integrated monitoring, including both chemical (nonylphenol, together with the parent compounds mono- and di-ethoxylated, and bisphenol A were chosen as model EDCs) and biological (estrogenic and <b>genotoxic</b> <b>activities)</b> analyses, was carried out. Removal efficiencies of measured EDCs varied from 20 % to 70 %, depending on flow conditions (ozone dosage being 0. 5 gO(3) /gTOC). Biological tests, furthermore, displayed that the oxidation stage did not significantly reduce (only by 20 %) the estrogenicity of the effluent and revealed the presence and/or formation of genotoxic compounds. These results highlight the importance of the application of an integrated (biological + chemical) analytical procedure for a global evaluation of treatment suitability; poor performances recorded in this study have been attributed to the presence of a significant industrial component in the influent wastewater...|$|R
40|$|Background. In the Po Valley {{aflatoxins}} play {{a relevant}} role: the local food economy is heavily based on cereal cultivations for animal feed and human nutrition. Aims {{of this project}} are the identification of new compounds that inhibit Aspergillus proliferation, {{the development of new}} inhibitors of aflatoxins production, and the set-up a practical screening procedure to identify the most effective and safe compounds. Design and Methods. New compounds will be synthetized with natural origin molecules as ligands and endogenous metal ions to increase their bioavailability for the fungi as metal complexes. A biotechnological high-throughput screening will be set up to identify efficiently the most powerful substances. The newly synthesized compounds with effective antifungal activities, will be evaluated with battery of tests with different end-points to assess the toxic potential risk for environmental and human health. Expected impact of the study for public health. The fundamental step in the project will be the synthesis of new compounds and the study of their capability to inhibit aflatoxin biosynthesis. A new, simple, inexpensive and high-throughput method to screen the anti-fungine and anti-mycotoxin activity of the new synthesised compounds will be applied. The evaluation of possible risks for humans due to toxic and <b>genotoxic</b> <b>activities</b> of the molecules will be made with a new approach using different types of cells (bacteria, plants and human cells) ...|$|R
