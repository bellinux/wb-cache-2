5000|$|Möllan is {{an ancient}} {{windmill}} {{on the outskirts of}} Skanör, situated {{at the beginning of the}} road to the harbour of Skanör. The origins of Möllan can be traced back to the twelfth century A.D. At this time, Skanör was Northern Europe's largest trading harbour for herring. At the annual herring market, up to 70000 people gathered in Skanör to buy and sell herring. Möllan was built on order of the Danish king to simplify the grounding of <b>herring</b> <b>bones.</b> Ground <b>herring</b> <b>bones,</b> known as [...] "Sillamjöl", was a common ingredient in the medicine of the time and also a popular aphrodisiac.|$|R

40|$|Long-term use of herring by Alaska Natives is not {{well-documented}} over {{space or}} through time, yet this information can illuminate pre-industrial patterns of herring abundance and distribution. Such information {{is important to}} understand the sustained relationships Alaska Native fishers and egg collectors have had with herring. Understanding the genetics of pre-industrial herring may also inform management of the fish and fisheries to insure their survival into the future. In this paper, we attempt a contextualized account of the long-term history of Alaska Native herring fisheries, bringing together archaeological, ethnographic, and ethnohistorical data. We tie these together as background for presenting the preliminary results of the NSF-funded project, The Archaeology of Herring: Reconstructing the Past to Redeem the Future (No. 1203868). We have now tested 84 <b>herring</b> <b>bone</b> samples from 17 archaeological sites in Alaska expanding beyond Speller et al. (2012), having tripled the earlier archaeological dataset. The oldest <b>herring</b> <b>bones</b> identified archaeologically in Alaska are dated to more than 10, 000 cal BP. Early Holocene and Middle Holocene sites have also yielded <b>herring</b> <b>bones,</b> although most of the record dates to the last 2400 years. Preservation of genetic information is effectively complete for the last 2400 years, but achievable back to the terminal Pleistocene (68 % success rate for samples between 10, 500 and 2400 cal BP). This gives considerable confidence to the potential to expand the analyses and develop a richer pattern of biological variability. The resulting data show genetic continuity between archaeological and modern herring populations. The main technical challenge for the future is to extract adequate amounts of nuclear DNA from the ancient samples for identifying more informative DNA markers {{that can be used to}} more effectively reveal any population diversity and/or population size changes over time when compared to modern herring...|$|R
