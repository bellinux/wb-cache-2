25|$|In 1992, Ice Cube {{assisted}} on debut albums from Del the Funky Homosapien (<b>I</b> <b>Wish</b> <b>My</b> Brother George Was Here), Da Lench Mob (Guerillas in tha Mist, 1992) and Kam (Neva Again, 1993), all {{of which}} enjoyed critical acclaim and some moderate commercial success. He handled most of the production on Guerillas in tha Mist.|$|E
500|$|Although he did {{not often}} write or speak about it, Tolkien {{advocated}} {{the dismantling of the}} British Empire and even of the United Kingdom. In a 1936 letter to a former student, Belgian linguist Simonne d'Ardenne, he wrote, [...] "The political situation is dreadful... I have the greatest sympathy with Belgium—which is about the right size of any country! <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>my</b> own were bounded still by the seas of the Tweed and the walls of Wales... we folk do at least know something of mortality and eternity and when Hitler (or a Frenchman) says 'Germany (or France) must live forever' we know that he lies." ...|$|E

6000|$|But a {{time came}} when, turning full of hate [...] And weariness from my remembered themes, [...] <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>my</b> poet's pipe could {{modulate}} [...] Beauty more palpable than words and dreams.|$|R

500|$|Released {{during the}} {{dominant}} Gangsta rap era of West Coast hip hop, Bizarre Ride {{was described as}} [...] "refreshing" [...] due to its playful, light-hearted humor and lush, jazzy production. Along with albums such as To Whom It May Concern... by Freestyle Fellowship, and <b>I</b> <b>Wish</b> <b>My</b> Brother George Was Here by Del tha Funkee Homosapien, Bizarre Ride helped establish a new alternative scene on the West Coast, followed by artists such as Hieroglyphics, The Coup and Jurassic 5. Despite its wide critical acclaim, the album produced only moderate sales, peaking at No. 75 on the Billboard 200 album chart in 1993. However, {{on the strength of}} the second single, [...] "Passin' Me By", the album was certified gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 28, 1996.|$|E
500|$|Along with Beastie Boys, 3rd Bass, and House of Pain, Ice {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} white rappers to attain major success. Chuck D has credited Ice as a regional breakthrough, stating [...] "He broke through in the mid-South, in a Southern area in Texas, in something that was kind of indigenous to that hip-hop culture down there. He just doesn’t get credit for it." [...] In 1991, 3rd Bass released a single called [...] "Pop Goes the Weasel", and in the lyrics comparing Ice unfavorably to Elvis Presley. The song's music video featured Henry Rollins as Ice, who is depicted as being assaulted by 3rd Bass. Ice responded to [...] "Pop Goes the Weasel" [...] with his 1992 song [...] "The Wrath". Del tha Funkee Homosapien referred to Ice in the lyrics of [...] "Pissin' on Your Steps", which appeared on his 1991 debut album <b>I</b> <b>Wish</b> <b>My</b> Brother George Was Here. Similar to 'Pop Goes the Weasel', the song negatively makes a connection between Ice and Elvis, while saying Ice alongside MC Hammer are mocking hip hop by being commercial. Vanilla Ice answered back to most of his critics in the song [...] "Hit 'em Hard".|$|E

6000|$|... "On {{her last}} {{birthday}} we breakfasted with my father-in-law Cantacuzene, and Madame Phoebus {{found in her}} napkin a check for five thousand pounds.

60|$|I echoed his laugh, {{but held}} my peace. It was not Milly alone from whom <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>my</b> present idea {{to be kept}} a secret. In fact, I had not thought of Milly at all. I was only anxious that de Cartienne should remain {{altogether}} in the dark as to my clue; and for a remarkably good reason.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>my</b> new comrades good-night as I {{left the}} room, and I {{repeated}} that I should hold myself {{at their disposal}} at five o'clock next morning.
