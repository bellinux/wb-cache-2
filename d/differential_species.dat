The present paper includes a revision of their <b>differential</b> <b>species</b> and their differential values. Alliances treated with suggestions of their associations (<b>differential</b> <b>species</b> of the alliances and associations in the relevé tables) : Echinodion prolixi Sjn. 93 (epiphytic; mostly above 600 m in native cloud-zone forest types); Lepidozion azoricae Sjn 96 (epixylic; presence as the Echinodion prolixi); Aphanolejeuneo-Colurion Sjn. 78 (epiphyllous; presence as the Echinodion prolixi); Andoae-Nardion scalaris Sjn. 95 (epigeic; from ± 200 - 1000 m a. s. l.) Ptychomitrion azorici Sjn. 93 (epilithic; in strongly exposed habitats, in coast-near localities to altitudes above 1000 m.; Heterocladio-Jubulion Sjn. 95 (epilithic; in weakly exposed habitats, from about 300 to 800 m a. s. l.). It has benn stressed that <b>differential</b> <b>species</b> occur with different values, both at various altitudes on the individual islands and also with generally reduced values from E to W in the archipelago, due to climatic differences. Only few <b>differential</b> <b>species</b> are restricted to one bryophyte alliance. Also, few bryophyte species are restricted in their presence to one type of substrate. Some of the bryophytes treated {{are more or less}} severely threatened as to their survival. Several of these species are <b>differential</b> <b>species</b> of alliances or associations, which mainly occur in mature native forests at altitudes above 500 m. During the last century these forests have become progressively reduced and are now restricted to some of the Azorean islands. Their preservation is highly important and urgent, not only as endemic ancient forest types but also due to their constitution with a large number of endemic vascular plants and bryophytes. LIFE-projects in 1995 - 1997 have given considerable support to this statement...|$|E

In addition, human 293 T cells expressing CAEV but not MVV-K 1514 envelope glycoproteins fused with a goat cell line persistently infected with MVV-K 1514, indicating that MVV-K 1514 does not use SRLV receptor A for cell-to-cell fusion.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{differences}} of opinion about the criteria for determining the descriptions of association and character-species in a phytosociological sense. Developing a phytosociological unit system has been complicated, because of this disagreement about the fundamental concept of phytosociology among phytosociologists, and also because no unified rules for syntaxonomical procedure exist. By comparing mutual species composition among same associations and some adjacent communities in local regions and over a wide area, we can recognize an independent association characterized by peculiar character-species in syntaxonomy. Moreover, after due consideration of several ecological, chorological characteristics of each association and its succession, we may identify character and <b>differential</b> <b>species,</b> by which an association is distinguished from other communities.

I examined: (1) {{the extent of the}} vegetation mosaic accounted for by floristic composition and geographic site differences; (2) differential site availability for seasonal colonization along complex hydrologic gradients of flood stress and flood disturbance, and suitability of experimental gap conditions to seasonal regeneration; (3) <b>differential</b> <b>species</b> availability for seasonal regeneration from the seed and bud bank; and (4) <b>differential</b> <b>species</b> performance of colonists from the seed and bud bank as alternate modes of regeneration with respect to complex hydrological gradients. ^ The vegetation mosaic attributed to plant community structure and geographic sites accounted for 51 % and 19 %, respectively, of the total floristic variation. Accordingly, the representation of vegetation types was not the same among geographic sites. Differential site availability for colonization into seasonal gaps or bare space varied directly with increasing flood stress and flood disturbance. <b>Differential</b> <b>species</b> availability, based on an inventory of 68 species present in the vegetation of the preceding year, consisted of 72 species emerging from the seed bank and 30 species emerging from the bud bank, of which 21 species were shared. <b>Differential</b> <b>species</b> performance resulted from a trade-off between alternate modes of regeneration. Seasonal regeneration from both buds and seeds diminished with increasing levels of flood stress, yet unlike the bud bank, the seed bank responded positively to flood disturbance. Confirmed experimentally, the trade-off between seeds and buds is most pronounced under more severe gap conditions. However, upon disturbance in sites ordinarily less disturbed, regeneration from buds exceeded seeds. ^ In general, hydrologic gradients accounted for the vegetation mosaic by determining which species, mode of regeneration, and range of response are the most appropriate for local persistence. However, under benign conditions of minimal flood stress and flood disturbance, the actual vegetation mosaic consisted of multiple, alternate, asuccessional vegetation types. The implications for conservation suggest re-examining traditional object-oriented practices in favor of preserving the ecological processes of the Connecticut River tidelands ecosystem. ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Biology, 2000 Desert {{water courses}} are topographically {{distinct}} features with periodic flooding, which are floristically rich and structurally complex. This study was undertaken {{to determine if}} plant species and vegetation types change along desert water courses as environmental gradients are crossed. In four granitic and four calcareous water courses, vegetation patterns were classified and described for 262 samples in the eastern Mojave Desert, California. In a broad altitudinal range from mountain slope to bajada, vegetation samples were systematically taken at 300 m intervals in a 9 km distance of each water course. A total of 15 alliances and 32 associations were delineated using Ward's method cluster analysis and Twinspan and were validated by Bray-Curtis ordination. The classification included alliances of one forest, two woodlands, two intermittently flooded shrublands, two temporarily flooded shrublands, and eight shrublands. Of these alliances, ten were at the canyon position, seven were at the arroyo position, and six were at wash position. Alliances dominated by Acacia greggii, Chilopsis linearis, and Prunus fasciculata were the most widely distributed, at more than one topographic position and on both granitic and calcareous substrates; however, these alliances had {{more than double the}} number of associations found specifically on limestone as compared to granite. Environmental gradients showed strong relationships to the overall vegetation patterns as expressed by multi-response permutations procedures, Indicator Species analyses, and Bray-Curtis ordinations. Vegetation types appear to be expressions of moisture and temperature gradients, nutrient availability, and regional locations as functions of aspect, elevation, geologic substrate, geographic position, surface rock cover, and topographic position.

40|$|An {{hierarchical}} syntaxonomic {{classification of}} the vegetation of the Camdebo and Sneeuberg {{regions of the}} karoo biome {{is presented as a}} second approximation after the earlier work by Acocks (1953). Details on the geomorphology, geology, climate, and early vegetation history of the area are given. The vegetation of the study area was stratified with the aid of Landsat imagery and the community classification was generated using two-way indicator species analysis (Twins pan) which produced ordered phytosociological tables. Tabular comparisons and final sorting of tables are according to the methods and techniques of the ZiirichMontpellier school of phytosociology. Syntaxonomic ranks are defined as five classes, nine orders and seventeen communities. The classes are Grasslands, Karoo Shrublands, Karoo Dwarf Shrublands, Sub-tropical Transitional Thicket, and Riparian Thicket. The distribution of syntaxa corresponds with the steep precipitation gradient experienced in the study area. These vegetation concepts are applied to the description of the flora of the Karoo Nature Reserve and an analysis of the total flora of the reserve is provided. The communities of the pediments, which contain the highest number of endemics, are poorly conserved. I test the validity of the vegetation classification by interpreting the results of an analysis of soils within the hypothesized vegetation units. There is a gradient of increasing Na, silt and pH levels from the Shrublands and Grasslands to the Succulent and Grassy Dwarf Shrublands of the pediments. A qualitative model of the vegetation history during the glacial-interglacial sequence in the Graaff-Reinet region of the eastern Cape is presented. Using a descriptive approach, the distribution patterns of 68 taxa, which are <b>differential</b> <b>species</b> for Karoo Shrublands, Succulent Thicket and Karoo Dwarf Shrublands, are investigated relative to major southern African biomes. The results indicate that {{a large proportion of the}} <b>differential</b> <b>species</b> in the phytosociological classification show affinity with Grassland and Savanna Biomes. Three species groups encountered in the Dwarf Shrublands show affinity with the Nama-Karoo biome. The <b>differential</b> <b>species</b> of the Succulent Thicket have a predominantly subtropical distribution. Using an historical approach, the palaeoenvironment of the region during the past 20 000 years is discussed briefly. On the basis of the descriptive and historical perspectives, a qualitative model of vegetation history is presented. The Succulent Thicket may have become established on edaphically favourable sites in the ameliorating conditions of the warmer, wetter Holocene subsequent to the Last Glacial Maximum. The Dwarf Shrubland and Succulent Dwarf Shrubland are depauperate in relation to ccmmunities in other southern African biomes, but the relatively large number of endemics suggests a long history in the region. Their <b>differential</b> <b>species</b> groups occur under arid conditions, accompanied by soils with high base and fertility status. The Dwarf Shrublands may have been more extensive during the drier glacial times on those sites currently occupied by Shrubland. The Shrublands display the expected affInity with the Grassland and Savanna Biomes. The small number of endemics suggest that these communities may have occupied the region in the period since the Last Glacial Maximum. Species with Succulent Karoo Biome affInity are poorly represented. The reliability of using Landsat products to detect and map the vegetation of the region is assessed. The manual classification of Landsat standard products provides a poor reflection of the vegetation of the arid, sparsely-vegetated bottomlands and pediments. The products provide good representation of the boundaries of thicket vegetation, but this uni-temporal approach does not distinguish between floristically different thicket communities. After analyzing digital Landsat data, I suggest that the multi-spectral scanner detects the boundaries of broad soil pedons and geological formations in areas of low vegetative cover. I describe and map the vegetation categories of the region after manual interpretation of six Landsat scenes. This is an effIcient, cost-effective method of mapping vegetation in extensive regions. The mapping units do not reflect the syntaxonomic classification, representing rather an integration of physiographic, pedological, geological and floristic information. With the view to improving the classification of these units, I develop a qualitative model of the natural resources of the region using an expert syste...|$|E
