40|$|The Belluno {{syncline}} is {{a structure}} {{located in the}} Venetian fold-and-thrust belt in the Italian Southern Alps. This SSE-vergent chain mainly developed during the Neogene as a back-thrust belt of the Alps deforming the northern margin of the Adria plate. The syncline is asymmetric in shape, with a steep backlimb, as the forelimb of the paired Monte Coppolo Anticline; it {{is the result of}} fault-propagation folding during the development of the underlying Belluno thrust. In plan view the Belluno thrust shows a prominent curvature interpreted as reactivation of inherited Mesozoic extensional structures. The hinge of the Belluno syncline presents a similar curvature. Rocks cropping out in the syncline core are Upper Chattian to Langhian fine-grained molassic sediments, mainly siltstones and marls. Most fractures on the Belluno syncline have formed at high angles to bedding. The dominant fracture trends are subparaUel and orthogonal to the <b>fold</b> <b>hinge.</b> Sometimes these fractures show plumose structures revealing extension (Mode I) fracture mechanism and therefore they are referred to as longitudinal (bc) joints and cross (ac) joints respectively. Other fracture trends oblique to the hinge line are found in measurement stations located on limbs distant from the <b>fold</b> <b>hinge.</b> They are referred to as oblique (shear) fractures. Throughout {{the western part of the}} Belluno syncline the fracture network maintains a roughly symmetrical distribution with respect to the <b>fold</b> <b>hinge,</b> suggesting a development in association with folding...|$|R

40|$|Quartzite {{samples taken}} in the east part of Krkonoše-Jizera Massif belong to {{metasedimentary}} cover of paraautochtonous unit. Rocks underwent a polyphase deformation which established a strong shape preffered orientation (SPO) of quartz grains. In folded quartz veins, deformation overprint mechanisms and microstructure, CPO and SPO relations were studied. For determination of crystal preffered orientations (CPO) the method of computer integrated polarization microscopy (CIP) was used. Microstructural analysis was focused on grain sizes, aspect ratios, long axis orientations and their relation to the deformation overprint grade. Results implies that dominant mechanism of quartz grain recrystallization is grain boundary migration. Folds were created by simple shear in microscale. The deformation overprint grade is strongest {{in the top of}} the <b>fold</b> <b>hinge,</b> where grains achieve highest aspect ratios and sizes.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the cleavage-fold {{relationships}} in the Lower Palaeozoic Brabant Massif, primarily because of the scarcity of suitable exposures. Moreover, to date, folds have only been described in the Ordovician and Silurian sequences along the southern extremity of the basement. However, excavation works for the construction of the TGV(railway) -track south of Brussels created an opportunity to study cleavage-fold relationships in the Lower Cambrian terrigenous series (Tubize Group) in a more central part of the Brabant Massif. The structural features observed seemed inconsistent with the suspected regional trends. Primarily, a divergent cleavage fan was observed in a region thought to have a regular cleavage attitude. The symmetrical but divergent disposition of the cleavage with regard to the <b>fold</b> <b>hinges</b> is explained by flexural folding of a pre-existing bedding-parallel compaction fabric. Cleavage development and folding are considered synchronous. The divergent cleavage fan reflects local strain variations. Also the steeply plunging hinge lines of the open, subangular folds are seemingly inconsistent with the regional trend characterized by subhorizontal <b>fold</b> <b>hinges.</b> Taking into account the structural position of the fold assemblage in the subvertical limb of a large-scale, upright, isoclinal fold structure, the fold assemblage is interpreted as an incongruous parasitic feature. The steeply plunging hinge Lines are considered to be caused by <b>fold</b> <b>hinge</b> rotation during progressive coaxial deformation. Although this incongruous fold assemblage with its divergent cleavage fan is localized, it provides important information on both local and regional deformation circumstances {{in this part of the}} Anglo-Brabant Fold Belt. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Regional lithostratigraphic and {{structural}} mapping of the Piermont allochthon of northwestern New England at its type locality {{indicates that the}} Foster Hill fault, the supposed sole thrust, is a stratigraphic boundary. Rather, the allochthon lies above the Bean Brook fault, covers a much smaller area than suggested previously, and {{is limited to the}} vicinity of Piermont, western New Hampshire. The allochthon, which primarily consists of rocks correlated with the Silurian age Rangeley Formation of Maine, has horizons of metamorphosed polymictic conglomerate at its base. Rocks directly below the allochthon are correlated with the metasedimentary, Ordovician-aged Albee Formation and contain abundant metamorphosed dykes and sills that do not cross the sole detachment of the allochthon. Analysis of macro- and mesoscale structures indicates local preservation of <b>fold</b> <b>hinges</b> and overprinting foliations oblique to and later than those previously described and has allowed the deformation history to be significantly extended by several events. Emplacement of the allochthon early in the deformation history at metamorphic conditions caused NW-SE elongation lineations of clasts in conglomerate {{at the base of the}} allochthon. The relict foliations and <b>fold</b> <b>hinges</b> are commonly preserved below the allochthon, suggesting that these rocks have had a more protracted deformation history relative to rocks in the allochthon.
