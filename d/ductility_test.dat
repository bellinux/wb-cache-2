Three heat treatments were studied using the Gleeble hot <b>ductility</b> <b>test.</b> A modified hot <b>ductility</b> <b>test</b> was also used to follow the evolution of microstructure during simulated welding thermal cycles. The microstructural evolution was correlated with the hot ductility data in order to evaluate the mechanism of hot cracking in alloy 718.

Ductility loss during cooling was not initiated until the constitutional liquation of NbC particles was observed in the microstructure.

The low C, low Mn/S steels showed embrittlement from 1073 K to 1323 K (800 °C to 1050 °C) because of precipitation of MnS at the austenite grain boundaries combined with large grain size. Isothermal holding for 10 minutes at 1273 K (1000 °C) coarsened the MnS leading to significant improvement in hot ductility. The highercarbon plain C-Mn steel only displayed a narrow trough less than the Ae 3 temperature because of intergranular failure occurring along thin films of ferrite at prior austenite boundaries. The low C, high Mn/S steel had improved ductility for solution treatment conditions over that of in situ melt conditions because of the grain-refining influence of Ti. The higher Mn/S ratio steel yielded significantly better ductility than the low Mn/S ratio steels. The low hot ductility of the two low Mn/S grades was in disagreement with commercial findings where no cracking susceptibility has been reported. This discrepancy was due to the oversimplification of the thermal history of the hot <b>ductility</b> <b>testing</b> in comparison with commercial production leading to a marked difference in precipitation behavior, whereas laboratory conditions promoted fine sulfide precipitation along the austenite grain boundaries and hence, low ductility...|$|R

A control RC member, which has no corrosion problem, was prepared to compare against corroded and repaired members. A number of reinforced concrete members having up to 50 % corrosion level were constructed and tested to study the effect of corrosion on the structural performance of RC members. The beams with corrosion problem were repaired using carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets and U-wraps.

The models {{are able to}} predict the fatigue limit and cause for fatigue fracture, and strain- and stress-development until fracture during the ductile fracture process respectively. Total fracture in a tool steel component, both in fatigue and <b>ductility</b> <b>testing,</b> {{is caused by a}} propagating crack initiated by particles, i. e. carbides or non-metallic inclusions. The models are based on experimentally observed size distributions. The axial fatigue strength at two million cycles was determined for various tool steels. The fracture surface of each test bar broken was examined in SEM to determine the cause for fatigue failure, i. e. a single carbide or inclusion particle or a cluster of carbides, {{and the size of the}} particle. The particles act as stress concentrators where a crack is easily initiated when the material is subjected to alternating stresses. The developed models calculate the probability that at least one particle will be present in the material which is larger than the threshold level for crack initiation at a certain stress range. The <b>ductility</b> <b>testing</b> was performed on various tool steels by four-point bending under static load. The load and displacement until total fracture were recorded and the maximum strain and stress acting in the material were calculated. The fracture surface of each broken test bar was examined in SEM, though the crack initiating area appears different compared to a fatigue failure. Ductile fracture is caused by a crack emanating from voids nucleated around many particles in a joint process and then linked together. By finite element modelling of void initiation and propagation in 2 D of an experimentally observed carbide microstructure for each tool steel, successful comparisons with experiments were performed. Carbides were modelled as cracked when larger than a certain size, based on fracture surface observations, and the matrix cracked above a pre-defined plastic deformation level. The stresses and strains at total failure were in good agreement between model and experiments when evaluated. The use of these developed models could be a powerful tool for optimisation of fatigue and ductility properties for tool steels. With good fatigue and ductility properties normal failures appearing during operation of a tool steel product could be minimised. By theoretical tests in the developed models of various carbide microstructures the optimum mechanical properties could be achieved with a minimum of experiments performed. QC 2010111...|$|R

The bitumens used are subject to continuous distillative and oxidative alteration processes within the chemical structure which lead to 'ageing behaviour' of the respective bitumen. The {{aim of the research}} work was to characterise the ageing behaviour of the highway construction bitumens and of the polymer-modified bitumes. The method of DIN 52016 was {{to be used as a}} basis for the work. Appropriate modifications (1 l round flask, rotational speed > 20 rpm, < 20 rpm) were made, however, in order to give the bitumens viscosity properties which could be considered and assessed in a more refined manner. The weight loss (DIN 52016), the changes in the ring and ball softening point (DIN 52011), in the needle penetration (DIN 52010) and in the ductility (DIN 52013), and the change in the force received during the <b>ductility</b> <b>test</b> were used for the assessment. In addition, IR and GPC spectra were produced so that changes in the molecular structure might be recorded. The investigations performed show that ageing with rotation, in accordance with standards, of the rotating flask is appropriate for an assessment. A 1 l flask should be used. Further modifications do not lead to any other generally applicable findings than can be obtained at present when the method in accordance with DIN 52016 is used. IR spectroscopy did not prove to be successful for analysis of the molecular changes in the bitumens as a result of ageing loading.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine whether the ductility and toughenability of a highly cross-linked epoxy resin, which has a high glass transition temperature, Tg, can be enhanced by the incorporation of a ductile thermoplastic resin. Diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) cured by diamino diphenyl sulphone (DDS) was used as the base resin. Polyethersulphone (PES) was used as the thermoplastic modifier. Fracture toughness and shear <b>ductility</b> <b>tests</b> were performed to characterize the materials. The fracture toughness of the DDS-cured epoxy was not enhanced by simply adding PES. However, in the presence of rubber particles as a third component, the toughness of the PES–rubber-modified epoxy was found to improve with increasing PES content. The toughening mechanisms were determined to be rubber cavitation, followed by plastic deformation of the matrix resin. It was also determined, through uniaxial compression tests, that the shear ductility of the DDS-cured epoxy was enhanced by the incorporation of PES. These results imply that the intrinsic ductility, which had been enhanced by the PES addition, was only activated under the stress state change due to the cavitation of the rubber particles. The availability of increasing matrix ductility seems to be responsible for the increase in toughness...|$|R
40|$|Scrap tires {{derived from}} {{automobiles}} {{have become a}} large environmental problem in the United States. In this study, research is carried out to investigate the potential use of tire-derived pyrolyzed carbon black from scrap tires as an asphalt cement modifier. 	The asphalt cements used in this research were AC 10 and AC 20. Penetration and softening point tests were performed to obtain {{the consistency of the}} asphalt cements. The pyrolyzed carbon black, as provided by Wolf Industries, was combined with the asphalt cement in the following percentages; 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %. Penetration, softening point and <b>ductility</b> <b>tests</b> were performed to determine the temperature susceptibility of the modified binder as altered by the pyrolyzed carbon black. 	In order that the results are comparable to previous testing, commercial carbon black purchased from CABOT Industry was also used as a modifier in the tests. The same test procedures were applied to the asphalt cements modified by commercial carbon black. 	The test results contained in this report illustrate the viability of the pyrolyzed carbon black as an asphalt modifier. Recommendations are provided to facilitate further research on this particular project. 	A preliminary assessment of a test road using the pyrolyzed carbon is appended...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} seismic performance of rehabilitated beam-column joint using FRP sheets and Buckling Restrained Braces (BRBs) and provide test data related to rehabilitated beam-column joints in reinforced concrete structures. The seismic performance of total six beam-column specimens is evaluated under cyclic loadings in terms of shear strength, effective stiffness, energy dissipation and <b>ductility.</b> The <b>test</b> results showed wrapping FRP sheets can contribute to increase the effect of confinement and the crack delay. Also retrofitting buckling restrained braces (BRBs) can improve the stiffness and energy dissipation capacity. Both FRP sheets and BRBs can effectively improve the strength, stiffness and ductility of seismically deficient beam-column joints...|$|R
