60|$|The {{circling}} hills {{the same}}, yet {{not the same}} as at night. A cooler, tenderer, more subdued cloak of color upon them. Far down the valley a cool, deep, impalpable, blue mist lay, under which one divined the river Ian, under its elms and basswoods and wild grapevines. On the shaven slopes of the hills cattle and sheep were feeding, their cries and bells coming to the ear with a sweet suggestiveness. There was something immemorial in the sunny slopes dotted with red and brown and <b>gray</b> <b>cattle.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1932, {{the first}} bull that Heinz Heck {{believed}} {{to resemble the}} aurochs, named ″Glachl″, was born. It was a 75% Corsican and 25% (<b>Gray</b> <b>cattle</b> × Lowland × Highland × Angeln) cross individual. This bull and its father subsequently were bred into further breeds to increase weight. As a consequence, most modern Heck cattle go back to Central European milk- and meat cattle that were supplemented by cattle from other regions. Advocates of Heck cattle often claim that Heinz′ and Lutz′ breeding results looked largely identically ″proving the success″ of their experiment. However, Berlin and Munich Heck cattle did not look very similar.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{done in this}} paper was made in Transylvania and Banat. The autochthon domestic endangered animal breeds were inventoried, zonal maps on where to encounter these breeds being drawn. The list of these species contains: the <b>gray</b> <b>cattle,</b> the Mocanitza (the mountain breed sheep), the Transylvanian Pinzgau, the black Pinzgau, the Transylvanian bull, the Nonius horse, the Western mountain hores breed, the Mangalitza breed, the Bazna breed, the black of Strei, the Transylvanian Merino, the curly haired sheep of Banat, the white goat of Banat, the hound of Ardeal region. In the last 20 years, in these species {{there was a significant}} drop in numbers and, in some cases, even in quality. If urgent measures to preserve these species will not be taken, {{there is a possibility that}} in the next 10 years, some of them will disappear. The protection plans for these breeds are, in the majority of the cases, just simple projects that no one is applying. Since 2007, in the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine there is a Data Base to monitor the native domestic animals from the western area of Romania. The data from this data base are used by farmers, pickers and specialists from the food industry...|$|E
50|$|The Dos Lomitas Ranch, {{also known}} as the Rattlesnake Ranch, Blankenship Well and the Gray Ranch, was the first of fifteen ranches and line camps in the <b>Gray</b> family <b>cattle</b> {{business}} in the Sonoran Desert country north of the US-Mexico border in Arizona. The ranch is now part of Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. The period of significance begins for the district with the purchase of the water rights for the ranch in 1919 and ends with the death with the last of the three Gray sons, Robert, Jr., in 1976, and the subsequent removal of the last of the <b>Gray's</b> <b>cattle</b> from the monument.|$|R

40|$|The {{genetics}} of coat {{color for}} cattle {{are important to}} breeders and breed associations because phenotypes of these animals are used for breed recognition and premiums or discounts can be given due to the phenotypes. The gene for gray coat color has been determined in other species, but not in cattle. Gray in cattle {{is known to be}} recessive based upon observed inheritance. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify the regions of the bovine genome associated with gray coat color in a population of Nellore-Angus crossbred cattle. Additionally, proportions of each color and spotting were of interest. Animals (n = 1941) were classified into phenotypic color categories (i. e. red, black, gray, etc.). Proportions of each color group out of the population were determined, and the proportion of those phenotypes that have any form of spotting. Two genome-wide association analyses were conducted, one where phenotypically gray vs. not <b>gray</b> <b>cattle</b> were analyzed and another where cattle that were very light in color but had a reddish tinge were included as gray. Analyses used Bonferroni correction at ? = 0. 05 (?/ntests = 1. 49 ? 10 ^- 6). Analysis of gray vs. not gray yielded one significant SNP marker on BTA 6 at a location of 68, 059, 441 bp (Praw = 9. 69 ? 10 ^- 7, Padjusted = 0. 032) (UMD_ 3. 1, NCBI project 32899, Gen Bank GCA_ 000003055. 3). For the analysis of gray and reddish tinged vs. not gray, there were 5 significant markers all on BTA 6 forming a region from 62. 93 Mb to 83. 92 Mb (UMD_ 3. 1, NCBI project 32899, Gen Bank GCA_ 000003055. 3). The same SNP marker from the first analysis was present in the second, but had an increased significance (Praw = 1. 50 ? 10 ^- 10, Padjusted = 5. 02 ? 10 ^- 6). The region on BTA 6 ruled out syntaxin- 17 (STX 17) on BTA 8 and premelanosome protein (PMEL) on BTA 5, previous gray candidate genes from other species, but includes genes such as v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KIT), which is known to cause white coloration (spotting), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha polypeptide (PDGFRA), the strongest candidate gene for the reddening in Nellore-Angus cattle, and corin serin pepsidase (CORIN), known for lighter coloration...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife, 2012 The great gray owl (Strix nebulosa) {{has been}} a state {{endangered}} species in California since 1980 because of low population size. Annual productivity of the great gray owl in California {{is thought to be}} largely dependent on vole (Microtus spp.) and pocket gopher (Thomomys spp., hereafter gopher) abundance, yet the factors influencing these prey populations have not been thoroughly investigated. The abundance of voles and gophers has been influenced by vegetation and cattle grazing in other regions, and many meadows are grazed within the breeding range of the great gray owl in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. Therefore I evaluated the influence of vegetation and cattle grazing on great gray owl foraging habitat by quantifying vole abundance, gopher abundance, and vegetative conditions in grazed and ungrazed meadows during owl nestling and fledgling stages. I surveyed 17 grazed and 15 ungrazed meadow sites in 2010, and 19 grazed and 19 ungrazed meadow sites in 2011. I found that vole presence was positively associated with plant sward height and corn lily (Veratrum californicum) dominance; vole abundance was weakly negatively associated with cattle grazing. Gopher abundance was negatively associated with site wetness, and positively associated with stem density, the frequency of forb presence, cattle grazing, and the dominance of corn lily. When managing meadows for great <b>gray</b> owl conservation, <b>cattle</b> grazing and vegetation should be monitored to accommodate the habitat relationships of both voles and gophers. Management of owl prey may be most efficient by prioritizing wet meadow sites for voles since gophers were not likely to be abundant in wet sites, and vole abundance has been correlated with moist soils in other studies. Therefore particularly in areas with moist soils, I recommend maintaining plant sward height commensurate with the habitat relationships of voles found in this study.
