500|$|According to Cohen, {{the writing}} team's {{approach}} when using pop culture references as an episode's main subject is to modify them into futuristic versions {{to avoid being}} dated, noting that being a science fiction show, [...] "some topics are probably not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>around</b> {{by the time the}} show airs."

By this time, she had hoped that Rand had moved over to become a counselor – an idea originally suggested by a fan. Alongside Majel Barrett as Christine Chapel, the duo were given four pages of dialogue initially which was trimmed down to one scene in the final film. Following the reappearance, Whitney was enthusiastic about returning as Rand, saying [...] "I think Janice Rand is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>around</b> for a long time, as long as they don't kill our characters off, we have a chance of constantly coming back." ...|$|E
