5|$|In the {{preparation}} of bean dip, various types of beans can be used, including black beans, pinto beans, <b>kidney</b> <b>beans,</b> white beans, fava beans, lima beans and edamame, a preparation of immature soybeans in the pod. Some bean dips incorporate several bean varieties into the dish, such as three-bean dip. Raw beans that are soaked and cooked are used, as are prepared canned beans and refried beans. The use of canned beans {{can result in a}} creamier dip, because beans prepared in canneries are pressure cooked in the can. Canned beans may have a salty flavor, which can be reduced by rinsing and then draining them. Fresh cooked beans may contribute to a more flavorful dish compared to using canned beans. Prepared canned green chili peppers are also sometimes used as a main ingredient.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prevalence}} of IgE mediated food allergies has {{increased over the}} last two decades. Food allergy has been reported to be fatal in highly sensitive individuals. Legumes are important food allergens but their prevalence may vary among different populations. The present study identifies sensitization to common legumes among Indian population, characterizes allergens of <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> and establishes its cross reactivity with other legumes. METHODOLOGY: Patients (n =  355) with history of legume allergy were skin prick tested (SPT) with 10 legumes. Specific IgE (sIgE) and total IgE were estimated in sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Characterization of <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> allergens and their cross reactivity was investigated by immunobiochemical methods. Identification of major allergens of <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> was carried out by mass spectrometry. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: <b>Kidney</b> <b>bean</b> exhibited sensitization in 78 (22. 0 %) patients followed by chickpea 65 (18. 0 %) and peanut 53 (15 %). SPT positive patients depicted significantly elevated sIgE levels against different legumes (r =  0. 85, p< 0. 0001). Sera from 30 <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> sensitive individuals exhibited basophil histamine release (16 - 54 %) which significantly correlated with their SPT (r =  0. 83, p< 0. 0001) and sIgE (r =  0. 99, p< 0. 0001). <b>Kidney</b> <b>bean</b> showed eight major allergens of 58, 50, 45, 42, 40, 37, 34 and 18 kDa on immunoblot and required 67. 3 ± 2. 51 ng of homologous protein for 50 % IgE inhibition. Inhibition assays revealed extensive cross reactivity among <b>kidney</b> <b>bean,</b> peanut, black gram and pigeon pea. nLC-MS/MS analysis identified four allergens of <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> showing significant matches with known proteins namely lectin (phytohemagglutinin), phaseolin, alpha-amylase inhibitor precursor and group 3 late embryogenesis abundant protein. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Among legumes, <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> followed by chick pea and peanut are the major allergic triggers in asthma and rhinitis patients in India. <b>Kidney</b> <b>bean</b> showed eight major allergens and cross reacted with other legumes.

25|$|The lucrative Mediterranean {{trade in}} spices, silk and other luxuries from Africa and Asia were shipped on the galleys of the {{powerful}} city-states of Genoa, Venice and Florence, making them phenomenally rich. Medieval Italy, meaning primarily the northern Italian Peninsula, {{was one of the}} few regions in medieval Europe where the distinction between nobility and prosperous commoners were more or less irrelevant, the result of a significant, rich and self-conscious middle class. This meant that the level of culinary refinement and diversity was especially great when compared to the rest of the continent. Italian cuisine was, and still is, better described as a multitude of highly varied regional cuisines, each with long traditions and their own specialties. Italian dishes can therefore be considered either traditional or imported. Being the hub of a vast trade network meant that there was greater access to foreign luxuries to influence the local cooking. Still, there was a great deal of conservatism and in general far more of local Italian foodstuffs were exported to the New World than the other way around, though the impact of important products such as vanilla, corn, <b>kidney</b> <b>beans,</b> and of course, the tomato, which had a considerable impact on the cooking south of Naples, even if this transition took some time.|$|E

40|$|Background Information: Proteins {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} compounds present in living organisms. Humans are believed to contain about 25, 000 different proteins, each involved in a specific function. The function of proteins is strongly dependent on their structure. Exposing the proteins to external factors such as high temperature (~ 100 oC) or to the digestive enzyme of the stomach (pepsin) generally affect their structure and hence their function. In this poster we present our results on the effect of heat and pepsin digestion on the function of a <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> protein. The <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> protein we have studied functions as an inhibitor of the intestinal enzymes such as trypsin and chymotrypsin. Aim: The main aim of this study was to investigate the effect of temperature and pepsin digestion on the chymotrypsin and trypsin inhibitory activity of <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> inhibitors. Experiments and Results: The <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> extract was separately exposed to a temperature of 100 oC for up to 3 hours and to pepsin digestion up to one week. The heat treated and pepsin digested samples of <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> extract were analyzed by the techniques of gel filtration and electrophoresis and their inhibitory activity against chymotrypsin and trypsin were determined by the spectrophotometric technique. The results suggest that the activity of <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> inhibitor is unaffected up to one hour of heating and up to several hours of digestion with pepsin.

2500|$|Vegetarian diets {{typically}} contain similar {{levels of}} iron to non-vegetarian diets, {{but this has}} lower bioavailability than iron from meat sources, and its absorption can sometimes be inhibited by other dietary constituents. According to the Vegetarian Resource Group, consuming food that contains vitamin C, such as citrus fruit or juices, tomatoes, or broccoli, {{is a good way}} to increase the amount of iron absorbed at a meal. Vegetarian foods rich in iron include black beans, cashews, hempseed, <b>kidney</b> <b>beans,</b> broccoli, lentils, oatmeal, raisins, [...] spinach, cabbage, lettuce, black-eyed peas, soybeans, many breakfast cereals, sunflower seeds, chickpeas, tomato juice, tempeh, molasses, thyme, and whole-wheat bread. The related vegan diets can often be higher in iron than vegetarian diets, because dairy products are low in iron. Iron stores often tend to be lower in vegetarians than non-vegetarians, and a few small studies report very high rates of iron deficiency (up to 40%, and 58% of the respective vegetarian or vegan groups). However, the American Dietetic Association states that iron deficiency is no more common in vegetarians than non-vegetarians (adult males are rarely iron deficient); iron deficiency anaemia is rare no matter the diet.|$|E
