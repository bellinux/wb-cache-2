We consider {{a firm that}} can invest in a project in either a single (lumpy investment) or multiple stages (stepwise investment) under price uncertainty and has discretion over not only the time of investment but also {{the size of the}} project. We confirm that if the capacity of a project is fixed and the <b>investment</b> <b>premium</b> associated with stepwise investment is positive, then lumpy investment becomes more valuable than a stepwise investment strategy under high price uncertainty. By contrast, if a firm has discretion over capacity, then we show that the stepwise investment strategy always dominates that of lumpy investment. In addition, we show that the total amount of installed capacity under a stepwise investment strategy is always greater than that under lumpy investment...|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of the stock market crash and {{secondary}} bank crisis of 1973-74, property prices in Britain tumbled dramatically. Investment fund customers attempted to liquidate their rapidly devaluing bonds, but the funds had insufficient cash to meet their redemption obligations, leading to their collapse. Nation Life, and its parent company, were forced into administration, and William Stern was declared bankrupt. The scandal was raised in the British Parliament on several occasions, and a BBC documentary on the subject aired in 1974. Thousands of private investors lost their life savings, since at the time there was no compensation scheme in place to protect them. As a direct consequence of Nation Life's failure, the 1975 Policyholders' Protection Act was introduced, which mandates investors' insurance be paid for by a one percent levy on <b>investment</b> <b>premiums.</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This article proposes an {{evaluation}} of capital investments that accounts for not only the initial assets, but also any potential growth options. Design/methodology/approach – Using a piecewise linear approximation, a robust valuation technique is demonstrated for analyzing capital investment opportunities containing expansion options in a finite time horizon. Findings – This process not only recognizes the option-like characteristics of the initial investment opportunity, but also recognizes the option-creating characteristics of the investment. This analysis shows {{that the value of}} capacity expansion options created by the initial investment has different dynamic characteristics from the assets in place. Although the growth options do not appear in the early <b>investment</b> <b>premium,</b> its impact on the investment decision is embedded in the investment threshold. When the time to expiration is short and the cost to delaying the assets in place is low, this analysis suggests that the initial investment decision might be made by ignoring the growth options. Originality/value – This real option methodology provides a continuous solution to the optimal investment threshold and is a viable alternative to the traditional finite difference approach.

40|$|Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) as {{alternative}} {{marine fuel}} has been regionally applied to several shipping segments {{for a few}} years. In recent time, the interests from ship owners in further exploring the viability and future market potentials of applying the LNG fuelling technology to large vessels such as VLCC and ultra large containerships has rapidly grown, mainly driven by tightening environmental legislation and increasing oil price. The key objective of this dissertation consists of two aspects, namely the assessment technical feasibility and the investigation of economic advantages. An extensive literature review of LNG fuelling technology was conducted as aspects of dual fuel engine manufacturing, vessel modification and bunkering methods. It was subsequently concluded that using LNG- dominant-fuelled propulsion for large-size vessels involved in long-haul trips, a VLCC in this project, is technically possible but needs collaboration from port operators with regards to port bunkering facility development. As for the economic advantages, research was performed based on one specific case study of investing a VLCC newbuilding to operate along a presumed transoceanic route. With an estimated 20 % <b>investment</b> <b>premium</b> based on the original price for a conventional VLCC, the payback time for investors {{is expected to be}} within ten years under most circumstances. The higher oil price is, the more cost-competitive it is to replace the current marine fuel with LNG. By improving infrastructure development worldwide, LNG delivery price as marine fuel could be largely reduced at some future stage, leading to a brighter future of this business area.

40|$|Risk {{shifting}} is {{a well-known}} agency problem in corporate finance which also exists between policyholders and shareholders of insurance companies. Shareholders engage in excessive risk taking {{at the expense of}} policyholders who, in turn, are less willing to pay for insurance coverage.

We first characterize Pareto optimal <b>investment</b> and <b>premium</b> policies and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for their existence and uniqueness. We then show that if shareholders cannot credibly commit to an investment strategy before policies are sold, they pursue an investment strategy that is either most risky or not risky at all.

We also document that {{the relation between the}} country risk and CECF premium is much stronger after the stock market liberalization. Since investors prefer to invest in emerging markets with high indirect barriers through country funds, they increase the premiums of the funds targeting those countries.

The study provides evidence of a positive (negative) association between target (acquirer) fees and the level of the premium.

The findings confirm the conflict of interests between target and acquirer firms where the investment banks' efforts are positively related to shareholders' interest. The study also finds that when acquirers pay higher fees than target firms, they pay lower premiums. The findings also imply that for the small proportion of mergers (13 %) resulting in relatively large value gains for buying firms, an acquirer might be willing to pay large advisory fees even though this may result in a higher <b>premium.</b> <b>Investment</b> bank reputation <b>Premium</b> Fees Synergy...|$|R
