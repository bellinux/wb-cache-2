Norid operates under contract with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, supervised by the Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority. Uninett took over responsibility for the Norwegian domain in 1987, and in 2003 it was spun off as a separate company. Only [...]no is open for registration.|$|E
50|$|A <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> {{registrar}} is {{an organization}} or commercial entity that manages the reservation of Internet <b>domain</b> <b>names.</b> A <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> registrar must be accredited by a generic top-level domain (gTLD) registry and/or a country code top-level domain (ccTLD) registry.

As of May 10, 2013 there were 583,962 registered -domains. Organizations with a presence in Norway and registration at the Brønnøysund Register Centre are limited to 100 domains each. Individuals residing in Norway may register in the second-level domain [...] and, as of June 17, 2014, directly under [...] Other second-level domains exist for organizations of certain types, such as municipalities and schools.

5000|$|Second-level domains {{commonly}} {{refer to}} the organization that registered the <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> with a <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> registrar.

50|$|Specific {{details of}} which records are stored vary among <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> <b>registries.</b> Some {{top-level}} <b>domains,</b> including com and net, operate a thin WHOIS, requiring domain registrars {{to maintain their}} own customers' data.

500|$|The <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> <b>registry</b> {{responsibility}} for [...] was in 1983 awarded to Pål Spilling at the Norwegian Telecommunications Administration's Research Institute. The actual registration work {{was carried out}} by Jens Thomassen. The first registered domains were [...] (the Norwegian Telecommunications Administration) and [...] (the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo). Initially the workload of domain registration was light, but after a few years the workload had become unmanageable as a side project for an individual. Policy-makers also indicated a need for the domain registration to be managed by a non-commercial organization. The responsibility was therefore transferred to the publicly owned Uninett, a supplier of information and communications technology to Norwegian public universities, colleges and research institutions on 17 March 1987. The oldest archived zone file dates from 1989 and includes 19 domains. In 1991 and 1992, all state university colleges were connected to the Internet and issued domain names, causing a boom of registrations. The 1000th domain was registered in 1995.|$|E

2500|$|Register.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc. (2000) is {{a further}} example of this {{temporary}} trend in which plaintiffs {{did not have to}} demonstrate any real interference. [...] Register.com, a <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> <b>registry</b> service, sued competitor Verio for using Register.com's proprietary WHOIS look-up service to find potential leads among its customer base.

Register.com had specifically withdrawn its consent to Verio's use of search robots to review Register.com's customer list. The court held that Verio caused harm to Register.com's files through the use of these search robots and that the searches improperly taxed Register.com's server capacity.|$|E

50|$|The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) is a {{flexible}} protocol designed for allocating objects within registries over the Internet. The {{motivation for the}} creation of EPP was to create a robust and flexible protocol that could provide communication between <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> <b>registries</b> and <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> registrars. These transactions are required whenever a <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> is registered or renewed, thereby also preventing domain hijacking. Prior to its introduction, registries had no uniform approach, and many different proprietary interfaces existed. While its use for <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> was the initial driver, the protocol is designed to be usable for any kind of ordering and fulfilment system.|$|R
50|$|Expired domains {{that were}} {{formerly}} websites are also sought after for parked domain monetization.
