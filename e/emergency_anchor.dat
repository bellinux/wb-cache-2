40|$|ABSTRACT Background. Orthognathic surgery means {{surgical}} {{correction of}} dentofacial and congenital deformities, which includes unsatisfactory facial aesthetics, malpositioned teeth, jaw malformations and masticatory dysfunction. Correction {{of these conditions}} requires a multidisciplinary approach {{with a combination of}} orthodontics and surgery. Successful outcome of orthognathic treatment requires pre-, intra- and postoperative considerations with a multimodal approach in order to minimize morbidity and enhance recovery after surgery. Developments within the orthognathic field should focus on multimodal approaches with combined effects of modern anaesthetic protocols, minimal invasive surgery and pharmacological modification of inflammatory responses. However, surgical morbidity after orthognathic surgery is still associated with undesirable sequelae such as damage to teeth, facial oedema, pain, neurosensory disturbances, prolonged recovery time and removal of titanium plates. Intraoperative anchorage of the occlusion is a major keystone in the implementation of the orthognathic planning during surgery. Bone anchor screws are therefore occasionally required in transalveolar positions as reinforced rigid <b>emergency</b> <b>anchor</b> for proper intermaxillary fixation in cases when orthodontic appliances loosen or when preoperative orthodontic treatment isn´t indicated. Furthermore, steroids are recommended to reduce swelling, pain, nausea and vomiting (PONV) and may promote nerve healing after surgery. The multimodal effects of steroids needs further investigation, thus the optimal dosages and the timing of administration is of great interest. Moreover, removal of inserted titanium fixation plates after surgery occur due to plate related complications. The reason for plate removal needs further investigation. Finally, different general anaesthetic protocols influence haemodynamics and subsequently postoperative pain, recovery and hospitalization. It is needed to understand the recovery process and to promote mobilization of the patient after surgery. Objectives. The aim of the first study was to evaluate two types of surgical techniques for insertion of bone anchor screws for intermaxillary fixation, regarding frequency of iatrogenic dental root injuries. The second trial investigated the efficacy of single versus repeated betamethasone doses on facial oedema, pain and neurosensory disturbances after bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO). The main objective of the third study was to investigate the incidence and reasons for removal of titanium fixation plates following orthognathic surgery, identify risk factors predisposing removal and to explore if the patients discomfort was reduced after removal. The primary objective of the fourth study was to evaluate haemodynamics and recovery parameters in relation to two general anaesthetic protocols; remifentanil-propofol based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) versus fentanyl-sevoflurane based balanced inhalation anaesthesia (BA) in orthognathic surgery. The second objective was to evaluate long duration local anaesthesia on recovery parameters and hospitalization. Material & Methods. Study I: Two surgical techniques were compared retrospectively (n= 123). Study II: Two study groups and a control group were compared with a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Repeated dose (4 + 8 + 4 mg betamethasone, n= 14), single dose (16 mg betamethasone, n= 11) and controls (n= 12). Study III: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed (n= 404) and additionally a questionnaire was used. Totally 323 (80 %) patients responded the questionnaire and were subsequently included in the study. Study IV: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed (n= 269). Ninety-four patients were audited due to strict inclusion criteria. Results. The first study revealed that the twist drill was hazardous in transalveolar positions since it could cause iatrogenic dental root injuries (p< 0. 001). The second study showed that steroids inhibited progression of facial oedema the first day after surgery (p= 0. 017). However, steroids did not reduce neurosensory disturbances over time. Reduced bleeding was associated with improved pain recovery over time (p= 0. 043). Patients requiring higher dosages of analgesics due to pain had significantly delayed recovery regarding neurosensory disturbances (p< 0. 001). The third study revealed that smoking, osteotomies performed in the mandible and additional number of inserted fixation plates resulted in more plate removal. A majority of the patients were relieved from plate related complications after plate removal. In the fourth study {{no significant differences between the}} two anaesthetic protocols were found regarding: blood loss, operating time, recovery time, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and hospitalization. Remifentanil-propofol based TIVA facilitated haemodynamic stability. Long duration local anaesthetics (ropivacaine 7. 5 mg/ml) administered at the end of surgery appeared to improve mobilization of the patient and reduce hospitalization. Conclusions. Morbidity was reduced when the twist drill was avoided prior the insertion of bone anchor screws in transalveolar positions. Steroids reduced facial oedema. The need for fixation plate removal was reduced when the numbers of inserted plates were minimized and smoking arrest was emphasized. Recovery from pain was enhanced when blood loss was minimized.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century, there has been widespread construction of submarine oil-gas transmission pipelines due to an increase in offshore oil exploration. Vessel anchoring operations are causing more damage to submarine pipelines due to shipping transportation also increasing. Therefore, it is essential that the influence of anchoring on the required burial depth of submarine pipelines is determined. In this paper, mathematical models for ordinary <b>anchoring</b> and <b>emergency</b> <b>anchoring</b> have been established to derive an anchor impact energy equation for each condition. The required effective burial depth for submarine pipelines has then been calculated via an energy absorption equation for the protection layer covering the submarine pipelines. Finally, the results of the model calculation have been verified by accident case analysis, and the impact of the anchoring height, anchoring water depth and the anchor weight on the required burial depth of submarine pipelines has been further analyzed...|$|R
40|$|This project maps an area {{within the}} North Sea to {{determine}} which parameters govern optimal routeing of a cable corridor. Whilst seas and oceans {{may appear to be}} a limitless space, there are the competing temporal and spatial requirements of multiple users to consider. Often submarine cables are damaged by the unwitting actions of others and therefore the main sources of cable faults and protection methods are outlined. How potential corridors for a submarine cable may be devised within a GIS is demonstrated. Starting with the shortest possible route, further routes were developed that balanced the need for cable security and avoidance of prohibited areas or obstacles, whilst attempting to maintain economic viability. Evaluation of the routes was largely subjective but through the application of a score system, a preferred route was found. Bathymetry and slope were shown not to be prohibitive to the corridor routeing. The parameters governing optimal cable routeing within the area of interest were determined to be: costs of cable and different protection methods; avoiding areas reserved for resource exploitation, energy production, conservation and physical obstacles, incorporating known threats such as fishing activity and <b>emergency</b> <b>anchoring</b> probability into the cable route. With higher resolution bathymetric data; additional current and sediment data; and fishing statistics a refined route could be produced with a BPI and corresponding burial depth recommendation...|$|R
500|$|The ship {{remained}} out {{of service}} during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, and next saw active duty in 1867, when she was recommissioned on 12 March for service as a tender in Kiel. On 15 October, she retrieved the main anchor from the corvette , which had been lost during an <b>emergency</b> <b>anchoring.</b> Camäleon remained in Kiel through 1868. During this period, she towed the steamer [...] and carried a 75-pounder gun to the coastal fortification on Friedrichsort on 30 March. On 16 April and 25 May, Prince Adalbert of Prussia came aboard to visit the ship. She carried Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia to Sonderburg on 15–16 June. A boiler explosion that destroyed one of her boilers forced her decommissioning on 26 August for repairs. She remained laid up until {{the outbreak of the}} Franco-Prussian War in July 1870. She was stationed as a guard ship off Friedrichsort {{for the duration of the}} conflict. On 1 April 1871, with the war all but over, Camäleon was decommissioned again. She was stricken from the naval register on 19 March 1872, owing to her poor condition. The ship was used as a harbor vessel in Kiel, and later converted into a coal storage hulk. While in Kiel, parts of the ship were removed for use in the construction of the new gunboat [...] Camäleon was broken up for scrap some time after 1878, but the exact date is not known.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} aspects of dual performance {{measures in the}} context of organizations disclosing operational performance to the general public through information dashboards. Dual performance measures are measures where performance is a function of two values, one value denoting the percentage of a group to which the measure refers and one value denoting the performance level achieved by that particular percentage. Dual measures must be anchored to either target percentage or target performance level before a decision on over- or under-performance can be made. A 2 × 2 experiment (n = 222), involving performance assessment of a fictional <b>emergency</b> room, varies <b>anchor</b> and presentation format, and measures the effects on subjective performance of the emergency room, as well as perceived informativeness and attractiveness of the dashboard. The results indicate, first, that choice of anchor matters, in the sense that anchor choice can mask or accentuate relevant information, thereby influencing subjective performance. Second, a pictorial unit chart combined with a performance-level anchor is perceived to be the most informative and most attractive dashboard display. The study contributes to research on the design of information dashboards by developing theory on the effectiveness of reporting dual performance measures...|$|R
