40|$|Because of the {{cumbersome}} conditions {{experienced in}} a maximum containment laboratory, methods for inactivating highly pathogenic viruses were investigated. The infectivity of Lassa, Marburg, and Ebola viruses was inactivated without altering the immunological activity after radiation with Co 60 gamma rays.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} whether hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) {{could be used}} to decontaminate caliciviruses from surfaces in a patient room. DESIGN Feline calicivirus (FCV) and murine norovirus (MNV) were used as surrogate viability markers to mimic the noncultivable human norovirus. Cell culture supernatants of FCV and MNV were dried in triplicate 35 -mm wells of 6 -well plastic plates. These plates were placed in various positions in a nonoccupied patient room that was subsequently exposed to HPV. Control plates were positioned in a similar room but were never exposed to HPV. METHODS Virucidal activity was measured in cell culture by reduction in 50 % tissue <b>culture</b> <b>infective</b> <b>dose</b> titer for FCV and by both 50 % tissue <b>culture</b> <b>infective</b> <b>dose</b> titer and plaque reduction for MNV. RESULTS Neither viable FCV nor viable MNV could be detected in the test room after HPV treatment. At least 3. 65 log reduction for FCV and at least 3. 67 log reduction for MNV were found by 50 % tissue <b>culture</b> <b>infective</b> <b>dose.</b> With plaque assay, measurable reduction for MNV was at least 2. 85 log units. CONCLUSIONS The successful inactivation of both surrogate viruses indicates that HPV could be a useful tool for surface decontamination of a patient room contaminated by norovirus.

At the highest dose of virus inoculated (5 log 10 50 % tissue <b>culture</b> <b>infective</b> <b>doses),</b> all four cellular responses reached high levels in the lungs of both groups of mice, and serum antibody titers were detected on day 20 after inoculation of either virus. However, whereas extensive replication of the parental virus occurred in the mouse lungs, very limited replication of the ca variant was observed. Macroscopically, infection with the parental virus caused gross lung damage, whereas such damage was almost absent in mice inoculated with the ca variant. Inoculation of 2 to 5 log 10 50 % tissue <b>culture</b> <b>infective</b> <b>doses</b> of the parental virus induced high cytotoxic T-cell responses, whereas only the highest dose of the ca variant caused a clearly significant cytotoxic T-cell response. As an inoculum of 5 log 10 50 % tissue <b>culture</b> <b>infective</b> <b>doses</b> of the ca variant caused a substantial primary immune response without appreciable lung damage, the avirulence of the ca variant may be primarily related to its limited ability to replicate productively in mouse lungs...|$|R

At 107. 0 to 107. 5 50 % tissue <b>culture</b> <b>infective</b> <b>doses</b> the A/Scotland/ 74 and A/Victoria/ 75 ca recombinant viruses were clearly attenuated and antigenic. However, one of eight vaccinees infected with 107. 5 50 % tissue <b>culture</b> <b>infective</b> <b>doses</b> of the A/Scotland/ 74 ca recombinant had a febrile reaction (39 °C). At a 10 -fold higher dose (108. 5 50 % tissue <b>culture</b> <b>infective</b> <b>doses),</b> 4 of 12 A/Scotland/ 74 vaccinees had a febrile and/or systemic reaction. Febrile reactions were not observed in volunteers who received the A/Victoria/ 75 ca recombinant virus, whereas 3 of the 12 vaccinees had mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, in one instance associated with mild systemic manifestations. Significantly, the serum hemagglutination- and neuraminidase-inhibiting antibody responses were comparable to those induced by wild-type virus. Both ca recombinant viruses were shed in low titer {{for a short period}} of time. Each isolate retained the temperature-sensitive phenotype. However, there was evidence of genetic instability of the ca marker in that 7 of 24 isolates exhibited some loss of the ca property, and one isolate completely lost the capacity to produce plaques at 25 °C. The retention of a low level of residual reactogenicity in the A/Scotland/ 74 ca recombinant suggests that acquisition of the ca and temperature-sensitive phenotypes by a ca recombinant virus may not always bring about a satisfactory level of attenuation for individuals lacking hemagglutinin immunity...|$|R

40|$|T-cell {{responses}} of pigs to hog cholera virus (HCV) have reportedly been absent or difficult to detect. Therefore, {{little is known}} about cellular immunity to HCV. In this study, we used an attenuated strain of pseudorabies virus expressing the envelope glycoprotein E 1 of HCV and purified recombinant E 1 to examine whether the E 1 protein is a target antigen recognized by the T cells of HCV-immune pigs. We were unable to identify the E 1 protein as a major target antigen recognized by the T cells of HCV-immune animals. However, such cells proliferated in vitro upon stimulation with viable HCV antigen. The lymphoproliferative response to HCV was strictly time and dose dependent and could be induced upon stimulation by live but not by UV light-inactivated HCV. Depletion studies demonstrated that lymphoproliferation depended on the presence of CD 2 +CD 8 bright+ lymphocytes, but CD 2 +CD 4 + cells also contributed to the lymphoproliferative response. The primary lymphoproliferative response in animals inoculated with 10 (7) 50 % tissue <b>culture</b> <b>infective</b> <b>doses</b> of strain Brescia 2. 1. 1 was stronger than that observed in animals inoculated with 10 (3) 50 % tissue <b>culture</b> <b>infective</b> <b>doses</b> of the Cedipest strain.

All ca viruses were less immunogenic than their wild-type parental strains {{by a factor of}} 10 (1. 3) to 10 (3. 4), probably due to the restricted capacity of ca viruses to replicate in the respiratory tracts of mice. However, their immunogenicity was considerably enhanced when two quite small doses were administered 3 weeks apart. The immunogenicity of ca viruses when administered in two doses and wild-type viruses when administered as a single dose varied according to their surface antigens.

40|$|A reassortant {{influenza}} A {{virus was}} produced by mating an avian influenza A/Pintail/Alberta/ 119 / 79 (H 4 N 6) virus with wild-type human influenza A/Washington/ 897 / 80 (H 3 N 2) virus. The avian-human influenza A reassortant virus contained the genes coding for the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface antigens of the human influenza wild-type virus and the six other RNA segments (internal genes) of the avian influenza A virus donor. In the lower respiratory tract of squirrel monkeys, this avian-human influenza reassortant virus, like its avian influenza A parent virus, was restricted approximately 100 -fold in replication compared with the wild-type human influenza A virus. Despite this restriction of replication, infection of monkeys with the avian-human influenza A reassortant virus induced resistance to wild-type human influenza A virus challenge. In comparison with the wild-type human influenza A virus, the avian-human influenza A reassortant was also fully attenuated when 10 (5. 5) to 10 (7. 5) 50 % tissue <b>culture</b> <b>infective</b> <b>doses</b> were administered to susceptible adult volunteers. Attenuation was indicated by a more than 300 -fold reduction in virus shedding and lack of reactogenicity. The reassortant virus did not spread to susceptible contacts {{and could not be}} isolated from the blood or stools of infected adults. The 50 % human infectious dose was 10 (6. 2) 50 % tissue <b>culture</b> <b>infective</b> <b>dose,</b> indicating that this reassortant virus is only slightly less infectious for adults than a similarly derived avian-human influenza A/Washington/ 80 X A/Mallard/ 78 reassortant virus. These findings suggest that the avian influenza A/Pintail/ 79 virus may be a satisfactory donor of attenuating genes for production of live, attenuated avian-human influenza A reassortant virus vaccines...|$|R
40|$|The {{mobilization}} {{and functional}} characteristics of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) {{at the site}} of an inflammatory stimulus were studied during acute cytomegalovirus infection in guinea pigs. Weanling Hartley strain guinea pigs were inoculated subcutaneously with approximately 10 (6) 50 % tissue <b>culture</b> <b>infective</b> <b>doses</b> of virulent salivary gland-passaged guinea pig cytomegalovirus. The virus was uniformly present in bone marrow, buffy coat, and casein-elicited peritoneal exudate cells 5 to 7 days after the inoculation. The mean numbers of circulating PMNs in the animals were 2, 862 /microliters in uninfected controls and 880 /microliters in infected animals. The total peritoneal PMNs recovered 14 h after casein injection were 491 X 10 (6) and 237 X 10 (6) in control and infected animals, respectively. The number of 50 % tissue <b>culture</b> <b>infective</b> <b>doses</b> of guinea pig cytomegalovirus per 10 (6) purified peritoneal PMNs was 10 (2. 17). Neutrophil O 2 consumption was similar in infected and control animals in response to either stimulation by a neutrophil activator, phorbol myristate acetate, or phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus. However, the maximal rate of H 2 O 2 release and the percent killing of S. aureus by peritoneal exudate cells from infected animals were significantly reduced compared with uninfected controls during acute infection. Granulocytopenia, a decreased mobilization of PMNs {{to the site of the}} inflammatory stimulus, a diminished cellular release of H 2 O 2 in response to a bacterial stimulus, and a modest reduction in bacterial killing were demonstrated during experimental acute cytomegalovirus infection. Such reductions in granulocyte number and function at inflammatory sites during this type of infection could alter antimicrobial defenses...|$|R
30|$|The titers of {{the three}} viruses were {{calculated}} by determining the 50 % tissue <b>culture</b> <b>infective</b> <b>dose</b> (TCID 50). The sensitivity of the multiplex assay was determined by testing tenfold serial dilutions of the human H 3 N 2 virus, the pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 or reassortant avian H 7 N 9 virus, or a mixture {{of the three}} viruses. Additionally, {{the sensitivity of the}} multiplex assay was also evaluated using tenfold serial dilutions of the RNA transcripts that were transcribed in vitro by a recombinant pGEM®-Easy plasmid (Promega, Shanghai, China) and the RiboMAXTM Large Scale RNA Production System-SP 6 (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, as described previously (Chen et al. 2011; Kang et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{hybridization}} {{techniques were}} {{developed for the}} detection and surveillance of bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 17 in the insect vector Culicoides variipennis, a biting midge. Radiolabeled RNA and cDNA probes were generated from sequences of the L 3 segment of BTV serotype 17. These probes were used to detect BTV RNA in pools of infected C. variipennis by hybridizing the probes directly to analyte immobilized on nylon membranes or by using a nucleic acid sandwich hybridization test. Hybridization procedures were able to detect 1 infected C. variipennis {{in a pool of}} 50 and as little as 3. 55 log 10 50 % tissue <b>culture</b> <b>infective</b> <b>doses</b> per ml of virus. These hybridization techniques provide an alternative to virus isolation for the surveillance of BTV in vector populations...|$|R
