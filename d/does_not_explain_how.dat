5|$|Cooperativity is {{observed}} when two synapses are activated by weak stimuli incapable of inducing LTP when stimulated individually. But upon simultaneous weak stimulation, both synapses undergo LTP in a cooperative fashion. Synaptic tagging <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> <b>how</b> multiple weak stimuli {{can result in}} a collective stimulus sufficient to induce LTP (this is explained by the postsynaptic summation of EPSPs described previously). Rather, synaptic tagging explains the ability of weakly stimulated synapses, none of which are capable of independently generating LTP, to receive the products of protein synthesis initiated collectively. As before, this may be accomplished through the synthesis of a local synaptic tag following weak synaptic stimulation.|$|E

He described Fawkes's appearance to arm Harry and then to heal him as a deus ex machina: he said that the book <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> <b>how</b> Fawkes knew where to find Harry; and Fawkes's timing had to be very precise, as arriving earlier would probably have prevented the battle with the basilisk, while arriving later would have been fatal to Harry and Ginny.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} not to over-interpret these diagrams. Nothing is implied about how a particle gets from one point to another. The diagrams do not imply that the particles are moving in straight or curved lines. They do not imply that the particles are moving with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight one does not imply that it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, somehow, move from point to point and electrons, somehow, emit and absorb photons. The theory <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> <b>how</b> these things happen, but it does tell us the probabilities of these things happening in various situations.|$|E

5|$|In September 2001, Studio Ghibli {{announced}} {{the production of}} two films. The first would become The Cat Returns and the second was an adaptation of Diana Wynne Jones' novel, Howl's Moving Castle. A rumor persists that Miyazaki had an idea to do Howl's Moving Castle {{during a visit to}} Strasbourg Christmas market. Toshio Suzuki, who produced Howl's Moving Castle, stated that Miyazaki was inspired to make the film when he read Jones' novel, and was struck by the image of a castle moving around the countryside. The novel <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> <b>how</b> the castle moved, and Miyazaki was interested in figuring out how the castle might move, which led to the image of a castle on chicken legs. The complex moving castle changes and rearranges itself several times throughout the movie in response to Howl's eccentricity and the various situations. The basic structure of the castle consists of more than 80 elements including turrets, a wagging tongue, cogwheels and chicken legs, that were rendered as digital objects.|$|E

25|$|Multistability (or multistable perception) is the {{tendency}} of ambiguous perceptual experiences to pop back and forth unstably between two or more alternative interpretations. This is seen, for example, in the Necker cube and Rubin's Figure/Vase illusion shown here. Other examples include the three-legged blivet and artist M. C. Escher's artwork {{and the appearance of}} flashing marquee lights moving first one direction and then suddenly the other. Again, gestalt <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> <b>how</b> images appear multistable, only that they do.|$|E

25|$|If {{the last}} plague indeed {{selectively}} tended {{to affect the}} firstborn, it {{could be due to}} food polluted during the time of darkness, either by locusts or by the black mold Cladosporium. When people emerged after the darkness, the firstborn would be given priority, as was usual, and would consequently be more likely to be affected by any toxin or disease carried by the food. Meanwhile, the Israelites ate food prepared and eaten very quickly which would have made it less likely to be contaminated. However, this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> <b>how</b> the firstborn cattle alone also would have perished.|$|E
25|$|Hydras are a genus of the Cnidaria phylum. All cnidarians can regenerate, {{allowing}} them to recover from injury and to reproduce asexually. Hydras are simple, freshwater animals possessing radial symmetry and no post-mitotic cells. All hydra cells continually divide. It {{has been suggested that}} hydras do not undergo senescence, and, as such, are biologically immortal. In a four-year study, 3 cohorts of hydra did not show an increase in mortality with age. It is possible that these animals live much longer, considering that they reach maturity in 5 to 10 days. However, this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> <b>how</b> hydras are consequently able to maintain telomere lengths.|$|E

He acknowledges the prior work of Edward Bagnall Poulton (The Colours of Animals, 1890) in identifying countershading in caterpillars, quoting some passages where Poulton describes how larvae and pupae can appear flat. Countershading is named as [...] "the law which underlies protective coloration", rather than as one of several principles.|$|E

500|$|In September 2001, Studio Ghibli {{announced}} {{the production of}} Howl's Moving Castle, {{based on the novel}} by Diana Wynne Jones. Mamoru Hosoda of Toei Animation was originally selected to direct the film, but disagreements between Hosoda and Studio Ghibli executives led to the project's abandonment. After six months, Studio Ghibli resurrected the project. Miyazaki was inspired to direct the film upon reading Jones' novel, and was struck by the image of a castle moving around the countryside; the novel <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> <b>how</b> the castle moved, which led to Miyazaki's designs. He travelled to Colmar and Riquewihr in Alsace, France, to study the architecture and the surroundings for the film's setting. Additional inspiration came from the concepts of future technology in Albert Robida's work, as well as the [...] "illusion art" [...] of 19th century Europe. The film was produced digitally, but the characters and backgrounds were drawn by hand prior to being digitized. It was released on November 20, 2004, and received widespread critical acclaim. The film received the Osella Award for Technical Excellence at the 61st Venice International Film Festival, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. In Japan, the film grossed a record $14.5 million in its first week of release. It remains among the highest-grossing films in Japan, with a worldwide gross of over Â¥19.3 billion. Miyazaki received the honorary Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement award at the 62nd Venice International Film Festival in 2005.|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{generating}} a coherent paragraph presenting arguments for a conclusion in a text generation system.

In previous work in text generation, rhetorical schemas (McKeown, 1985) and RST (rhetorical struc-ture theory) (Mann & Thompson, 1987) have been proposed as operational techniques to produce coherent paragraphs. We have found, however, that these tech-niques, in their current forms, are not appropriate to ad-dress the task of generating argumentative paragraphs for two main reasons: first, RST relations are too generic to perform argument selection and construct coherent ar-gument chains; second, rhetorical relations in both theories <b>do</b> <b>not</b> influence directly linguistic realization and therefore cannot determine wording decisions of the type illustrated in Figure 1...|$|R

2500|$|Continuing on {{the theme}} of the Einsatzgruppen, Sydnor criticised Irving for his {{statement}} that the Babi Yar massacre of September 1941 was the first massacre carried out by the Einsatzgruppen in 1941, when in fact the Einsatzgruppen had been staging massacres of Soviet Jews since the beginning of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941. Sydnor charged Irving with offering a false interpretation of Hitler's reaction to Konrad Morgen's report of October 1944 about widespread corruption in the SS as marking Hitler's moral outrage at the Holocaust; Sydnor asserted that Hitler's outrage {{had nothing to do with}} the murder of the Jews, and everything to do with the revelation of SS corruption. Concerning Irving's claim that General Friedrich Olbricht was engaged in an orgy on the night of 20 July 1944 in reaction to the news of Hitler's apparent assassination, Sydnor noted that Irving <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>explain</b> <b>how</b> General Olbricht could have been directing a putsch at the Bendlerblock on the night of 20 July while at the same time engaging in an orgy at his home. Sydnor accused Irving of selective quotation from the memoirs of Joachim von Ribbentrop, noting that Irving quoted the passage: [...] "How things came to the destruction of the Jews, I just don't know...But that he [...] ordered it, I refuse to believe, because such an act would be wholly incompatible with the picture I always had of him", but did not quote the next sentence where Ribbentrop wrote: [...] "On the other hand, judging from his [...] last will, one must suppose that he at least knew about it, if, in his fanaticism against the Jews, he didn't also order it". Finally, Sydnor argued that Irving's account of the final days of Hitler appeared to comprise little more than a rehashing of Hugh Trevor-Roper's 1947 book, The Last Days of Hitler, only with Hitler as an object of sympathy, rather than scorn.|$|E
