40|$|This article {{addresses}} <b>disaster</b> recovery <b>preparedness</b> characteristics {{prescribed by}} literature and guidelines. An exploratory {{study was conducted}} in 25 Dutch safety regions to describe the status of <b>disaster</b> recovery <b>preparedness</b> with an emphasis on psychosocial support aspects. The study pointed at substantial cross-regional variation. Particular areas of improvement were identified in relation to involving citizens and partner organizations in safety regions’ recovery planning efforts, {{and the extent to which}} preparedness activities are guided by regional risk profiles. Optimization of preparedness takes place in an everyday context where relatively little priority is assigned to disaster recovery. Also, as major crises are fairly scarce there is little room for learning or routinization. Deliberate investments to enhance <b>disaster</b> recovery <b>preparedness</b> are needed, they would however benefit from more research into the association between relevant conditions, the <b>disaster</b> recovery <b>preparedness</b> level and the quality of service delivery when an event actually takes place.

5|$|In {{the days}} prior to hitting Dominica, David was {{originally}} expected to hit Barbados and spare Dominica in the process. However, on August 29 a turn in the hours before moving through the area caused the 150 mph (240 km/h) hurricane to make a direct hit on {{the southern part of}} Dominica. Even as it became increasingly clear that David was headed for the island, residents did not appear to take the situation seriously. This can be partly attributed to the fact that local radio warnings were minimal and <b>disaster</b> <b>preparedness</b> schemes were essentially non-existent. Furthermore, Dominica had not experienced a major hurricane since 1930, thus leading to complacency amongst much of the population. This proved to have disastrous consequences for the island nation.|$|E
