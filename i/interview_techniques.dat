25|$|After Lazarus {{had checked}} her gun {{and come to}} the {{interrogation}} room, they explained that this was really about some loose ends they were trying to tie up in the Rasmussen case, since her name had come up in the investigation. They claimed they wanted a private setting because while Ruetten was an old boyfriend, she was long married to someone else and did not want her private life to become the subject of office gossip. Stearns and Jaramillo knew they would have to tread carefully since Lazarus herself was well aware of police <b>interview</b> <b>techniques</b> and her rights to silence and legal counsel, which she could invoke at any time. They rambled and digressed from the subject at times, sometimes discussing unrelated police business, but eventually came back to Rasmussen. Lazarus claimed to recall little due to the intervening years, but gradually revealed more and more knowledge—including oblique acknowledgements of her visits to the Ruetten condo—until she accused her colleagues of considering her a suspect, whereupon they allowed that there was DNA evidence connecting her to the crime scene and she was free to go. She left the room and was immediately arrested and charged with the murder.|$|E
500|$|The Most Hated Family in America {{received}} a positive reception, with four-star ratings from publications The Daily Record and The Mail on Sunday. It was recommended in reviews as a critic's choice by The Daily Mail, The Independent, The Times, Financial Times, The Age, and the Herald Sun. A {{review in the}} Leicester Mercury noted of Theroux's <b>interview</b> <b>techniques,</b> [...] "His subtle interviewing style was perfect for showing off the crazy views of the members."

500|$|Writing for The Scotsman, Andrea Mullaney articulated, [...] "Theroux {{really had}} found the {{ultimate}} in weirdness for his latest documentary – they're so beyond the point of reason, into a self-perpetuating psychosis, {{that no matter how}} he tried, he couldn't challenge their beamingly-delivered pronouncements, or trip them up. But he did manage to show them as human beings (more than the courtesy they extend to us sinners)." [...] Hilary Fannin of The Irish Times commented that the airing of the documentary, [...] "saw Louis Theroux, in The Most Hated Family in America, shatter another redneck American target, the Westboro Baptist Church". In a review of the documentary for The Sunday Times, Roland White discussed Theroux's stylistic technique, [...] "Theroux's usual technique [...] the friendly ingenue [...] made absolutely no impact on these people. It was like watching a youngster from a village cricket team trying to bowl out Geoff Boycott, and I began to wonder what Theroux was hoping to achieve. It is impossible to outargue the religious bigot. They have impeccable logic on their side: the word of God is the righteous truth; only they understand the true word of the Lord; therefore, they are right and everybody else is wrong." [...] Liverpool Daily Post recommended the film in its column, [...] "Sunday: What to Watch". Writing for the Birmingham Mail, Graham Young observed, [...] "The Most Hated Family in America is the best documentary from Louis since long before his Michael Jackson fiasco." [...] John Dugdale of The Sunday Times highlighted the film as his [...] "Pick of the day". Dugdale wrote favorably of the film, [...] "There are echoes of Theroux's film about a woman raising her daughters as neo-Nazis as he watches Phelps' daughter, Shirley, handing out placards to kids as young as seven. While tangling with her and her dad is pointless, the family's younger women are less inflexible, and his encounters with them are more rewarding."
