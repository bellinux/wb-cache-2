25|$|Unfortunately, {{in early}} 1913, Goddard became seriously ill with tuberculosis, {{and had to}} leave his {{position}} at Princeton.

25|$|Hawthorne's {{hospital}} is remembered {{as one of}} the most progressive American mental health facilities of its era.

25|$|In 1855 Osborn, who {{had been}} one of the charter {{officers}} of the Illinois Central two years earlier, visited the Highlands to take <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> and scenic beauty of the area. He enjoyed his visit so much that he decided to buy the property where Castle Rock and its associated properties now stands. He and his family spent summers in Wing and Wing until the castle was completed the year before he retired from the railroad industry as president of the Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans Railroad. He lived there until his death in 1894, devoting his time and money to philanthropic activities in New York.|$|E
60|$|It {{is hoped}} he will recover <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresher</b> <b>air.</b> It is {{represented}} {{that he is}} not in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend who is under the displeasure of the Republic.|$|R

500|$|In 2002, the North Circular {{was rated}} as Britain's noisiest road by the UK Noise Association. In 2013, {{the road was}} named in a BBC report as being the most {{polluted}} in London, including the highest surveyed levels of benzene and nitrogen dioxide. A report in the Sunday Times, referring to the North Circular, said [...] "if you want to pull back the lid of your convertible and drink <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air,</b> look elsewhere".|$|E
60|$|Toward the {{afternoon}} Mrs. Wragge took courage {{to start a}} suggestion of her own--she pleaded for a little turn <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} very glad {{for her to}} do so. It is just getting cool and {{pleasant}} for walking, and half an hour <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> will do her good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where George is, {{there is}} my home. But, oh, what would I not give {{for one last}} walk {{together}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> morning <b>air</b> upon those beautiful downs!" ...|$|R
60|$|Tallente smiled. There was {{something}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh,</b> cold <b>air</b> wonderfully alluring after {{the atmosphere of}} the room he had quitted. He turned his coat collar up and strode down the avenue.|$|R
60|$|They found Harry Moss and Joe Davis {{walking slowly}} toward Putnam Hall. Joe {{seemed to feel}} all right {{now that he was}} out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> evening <b>air,</b> but Harry complained of a strange {{sickness}} at the stomach.|$|R
60|$|I glanced towards Guest. There {{was a new}} fire in his eyes. I {{saw that}} the idea appealed to him. Nervously he flung {{down the window and}} let <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{good to be}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> again, eh, lad?" [...] {{observed}} Leroy. [...] "But I'm afraid we'll have a {{good bit}} o' trouble gettin' past them rebels," [...] he added to George Boxer.|$|E
6000|$|Poor little woman! I see her now in {{the shabby}} grey alpaca, with the inkstains on it. Perhaps a day at [...] "Glorious Goodwood," [...] or {{anywhere}} else <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air,</b> might have put some colour into her cheeks.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> 1879, at <b>the</b> {{instruction}} of the then Lord Provost, Thomas Jamieson Boyd, the infirmary {{moved to a}} new location, then <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresher</b> <b>air</b> of <b>the</b> edge of the city. The site, on Lauriston Place, had been occupied by George Watson's Hospital (a school, known then as a hospital). The school moved a short distance away to the former Merchant Maiden Hospital (another school) <b>in</b> Archibald Place. <b>The</b> original school building, by the same William Adam as the earlier infirmary, was incorporated into the new David Bryce-designed infirmary buildings and <b>the</b> chapel remained <b>in</b> use for <b>the</b> entirety of the infirmary's occupation of the site.|$|R
6000|$|Queen of my tub, I merrily sing, [...] While {{the white}} foam rises high, [...] And sturdily wash and rinse and wring, [...] And fasten the clothes to dry. [...] Then out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> free <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> they swing, [...] Under the sunny sky.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wasn't aware, Maurice," [...] she said, [...] "that I {{have been}} very different. I have had {{headaches}} now and then, lately. Fancy having a headache an afternoon like this!" [...] she added, throwing back her head once more, and breathing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh,</b> invigorating <b>air.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{agree with}} that opinion," [...] {{returned}} Colonel Colby coldly. [...] "The boys must have some exercise. And to be out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> {{is a very good}} thing for them. They will study so much the better for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [134] Their miraculous {{preservation}} was {{wrought by}} their keeping <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> {{of the open}} fields. It seems curious that after this object lesson the physicians persisted in their absurd policy of shutting up infected houses, thus practically condemning to death their inmates.|$|E
60|$|O'Connor {{was already}} astir, {{preparing}} breakfast. Cold boiled mussels {{and a bit}} of pork may be good food, but it is not appetising.

60|$|Malgre her disinclination, Rachel {{had reached}} the point of {{recovery}} <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> and change of scene of the drive to Avoncester could not fail to act as restoratives, and the first evening with the Dean and his gentle old sister was refreshing and comfortable to her spirits.|$|R
60|$|But {{it was not}} for long. He {{was down}} again in a minute, and, passing his hand under my arm, he half led and half carried me out of the house. It was not until we were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> night <b>air</b> again that he opened his mouth.|$|R

60|$|Under {{this last}} trial of her fortitude, Mrs. Bowmore's feeble {{reserves}} of endurance completely gave way. The poor lady turned faint and giddy. Amelia placed {{her on a}} chair in the hall, and told the cook to open the front door, and let <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
60|$|One {{afternoon}} the three chums {{had a very}} hard lesson in Latin to do. It was a clear, sunshiny day and they {{had one of the}} windows wide open to let <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air.</b> Dave and Roger were bending over their books when they heard a sudden exclamation from Phil.|$|E
60|$|Mabel's cheeks had regained {{a little}} of their ancient bloom <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> of the morning; but at this unlooked-for address they blanched again, nearly to the pallid hue which grief had {{imprinted}} there. Still, she looked kindly, though seriously, at Pathfinder and even endeavored to force a smile.|$|E
60|$|The {{two girls}} parted at Trafalgar Square, and Sybil, still <b>in</b> love with <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air,</b> turned blithely westward on foot. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Haymarket she came {{face to face}} with Brooks.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Porter lay long next morning, and, {{dressing}} with comfortable slowness, noticed {{with pleasure}} {{that the sun}} was shining. Visions of a good breakfast and a digestive pipe, followed by a walk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air,</b> passed before {{his eyes as he}} laced his boots. Whistling cheerfully he went briskly downstairs.|$|E
60|$|Leaving their dress-suit {{cases on}} the piazza, the Rover boys {{walked around the}} side of the {{farmhouse}} in the direction of the kitchen. The building was a low and rambling one and they had to pass a sitting-room. Here they found a window wide open to let <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> and sunshine.|$|E
60|$|They {{were out}} the whole day. When they reached home again, it was after dark. The long {{succession}} of hours passed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> left them both with {{the same sense of}} fatigue. Again that night Magdalen slept the deep dreamless sleep of the night before. And so the Friday closed.|$|E

50|$|While {{the miners}} {{were trying to}} wrestle the gold from deep within the earth, James Madison brought a wagon load of young apple trees up into the mountains. The fruit trees flourished <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clear, <b>fresh</b> <b>air.</b> Apples are still a big product in Julian, {{many of which are}} used for making the world-famous Julian apple pies.|$|R
60|$|I felt unusual exhilaration as we rattled along <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fresh</b> frosty <b>air,</b> {{and crossed}} the fields, which, with the silvered trees and bushes, contrasted so pleasantly with the clear blue sky.
