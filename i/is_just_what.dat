25|$|Though not {{linked to}} flying saucers or odd aerial lights, {{it is perhaps}} worth noting {{that there is a}} long history of claims of contact with non-earthly intelligences. The {{founding}} revelations of many of the world's religions involve contact between the founder and a supernatural source of wisdom, such as a god in human form or an angel. In this context, it might be expected that most of the 1950s contactees would form their own religions, with the contactee as sole spiritual leader, and that <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> happened, almost invariably.|$|E
25|$|Recall that {{vertical}} coordinate {{lines in}} our chart represent the world {{lines of the}} dust particles, but despite their straight appearance in our chart, the congruence formed by these curves has nonzero vorticity, so the world lines are actually twisting about each other. The fact that the null geodesics spiral inwards in the manner shown above means that when our observer looks radially outwards, he sees nearby dust particles, not at their current locations, but at their earlier locations. This <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> we would expect if the dust particles are in fact rotating about one another.|$|E
25|$|While the Aitareya deals almost {{exclusively}} with the Soma sacrifice, the Kaushitaka, {{in its first}} six chapters, treats of the several kinds of haviryajna, or offerings of rice, milk, ghee, etc., whereupon follows the Soma sacrifice in this way, that chapters 7–10 contain the practical ceremonial and 11–30 the recitations (shastra) of the hotar. Sayana, {{in the introduction to}} his commentary on the work, ascribes the Aitareya to the sage Mahidasa Aitareya (i.e. son of Itara), also mentioned elsewhere as a philosopher; and it seems likely enough that this person arranged the Brahmana and founded the school of the Aitareyins. Regarding the authorship of the sister work we have no information, except that the opinion of the sage Kaushitaki is frequently referred to in it as authoritative, and generally in opposition to the Paingya—the Brahmana, it would seem, of a rival school, the Paingins. Probably, therefore, it <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> one of the manuscripts calls it—the Brahmana of Sankhayana (composed) in accordance with the views of Kaushitaki.|$|E

500|$|After refusing {{an offer}} {{to sing a song}} for A. R. Rahman's album Blue, Akhtar acted in, and {{produced}} his sister Zoya's directorial and written debut Luck By Chance, which had Hrithik Roshan and Konkona Sen Sharma in the lead roles. He was cast in the film after being deemed as a [...] "perfect choice" [...] for it. The story of the film revolved around a struggling actor who arrives in Mumbai to become a film star. It was released on 30 January 2009. Though failing to do well at the box office and being declared a [...] "flop", the film received generally positive reviews from critics. Neil Genzlinger from The New York Times said: [...] "It is Mr. Akhtar whose understated performance holds together this far-ranging, cameo-filled film. He manages to remain sympathetic even while wreaking romantic havoc." [...] Rajeev Masand noted: [...] "Farhan Akhtar delivers a simple-enough likeable performance that <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> the film required— no showy flourishes, no loud outbursts, just a straight off spontaneous act that works like a dream." ...|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "Not {{one of the}} tracks is second-rate, and the best songs on Something to Remember rank among the best pop music of the '80s and '90s". Neil Strauss of The New York Times felt all the songs on the album [...] "cohere better than a greatest-hits package would" [...] and [...] "they tell a story of their own, of a voice and attitude that have hardened in the dozen years that have elapsed between the bubble-gum-chomping innocence of 1983's 'Crazy for You' and the tortured torch singing of the new 'You'll See'." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly commented: [...] "By placing her greatest-hit ballads ('Live to Tell', 'Crazy for You', 'Take a Bow', etc.) in a new context—that is, separated from her more attention-getting dance music—Madonna reinvigorates them, which <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> a good best-of compilation is supposed to do. The three new songs 'You'll See', 'One More Chance', and a wonderfully eerie version of Marvin Gaye's 'I Want You' are consumer enticements that just add to the allure." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 27, 2012, Big Sean {{announced}} his second studio album {{with the title}} Hall of Fame: Memoirs of a Detroit Player, and then has announced a release date for December 2012.

He then said that he feels [...] "like situations are really going to be relatable to people." [...] He then stated that he [...] "didn't want to just do another club song", and he didn't even wanted to follow these popular music standards. [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> the fuck I want to do. Some people are going to like it. Some people are going to hate it; regardless, I'm just doing me." [...] Sean then said that Hall of Fame will be a far more inspirational and a more conceptually-driven project than his debut album. He even went on by saying the fact that he wants to teach, while making his lasting impact on peoples' lives with this second album. During an interview with Power 105, Sean stated that he would include some skits on the album to give it a [...] "classic feel". He even indicated that the song [...] "Mula" [...] featuring French Montana (which also this track was included on the mixtape Detroit), could be featuring as the track for his deluxe edition.|$|E

500|$|Accompanying Duff's {{new musical}} style, the record label began {{promoting}} {{her with a}} more mature image. Duff dyed her hair dark and [...] "sexed-up" [...] her image. According to Duff, she wanted to [...] "try new things", but the image change [...] "just happened. It is not like a conscious change. People think it is so different because they have watched me grow up but that <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> happens in life." [...] Entertainment Weekly described Duff's new look as comprising [...] "dark mane, dental veneers, luxe and vampy fashions". In mid-2007, concurrent to {{the preparation of the}} radio release of [...] "Stranger", Duff was featured on the July covers of the magazines Us Weekly and Shape in a bikini, and on the August cover of Maxim accompanied by the declaration that she had gone [...] "from the queen of teen to breakout sex symbol". The Associated Press wrote that Duff's more provocative image would help her singles to garner mainstream radio play. Guy Zapoleon, a radio consultant and former programmer for Top 40 radio, explained that [...] "radio has a stigma about playing [...] acts, considering them teen and preteen in their appeal", and that Duff's provocative image would [...] "definitely {{have a positive effect on}} the attitude of programmers, who are mostly male, as Disney tries to mature her image". A bonus EP containing five bonus remixes was released exclusively to US WalMart stores as a package with the album.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{critically}} acclaimed by television critics. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times opined, [...] "Those cues also hold out {{the promise that}} the coming season will once again pivot {{the story on the}} workplace. It’s where Mad Men started and where it was best. A fresh start at the rat race <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> the series needs." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a nine out of ten, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. Goldman felt that it start of the season on a strong note, writing, [...] "It's a clever beat to start out with, leading into a strong premiere that quickly drops us into what can be described as Mad Men 2.0." [...] Praise was also directed to the musical selection of the episode, which Goldman described as excellent. In concurrence, Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the episode an 'A' grade, praising the character development of Don Draper and Peggy Olson. Expressing that she had more confidence, Phipps said of Peggy: [...] " [...] the person who's changed most notably over the last year. She drinks at work like the boys and [...] goes into a Don-like trance as she searches for inspiration. She bosses Joey around and tells him when he’s gone too far. And she’s not afraid to get creative to sell ham and wants credit for her idea, even if it encounters a minor disaster along the way. Most significantly, she’s standing up to Don at every turn now. He bullies her in front of her fiancé but hears about it later. And she provides a devastating mixture of admiration and chiding when she reminds Don that everyone at SCDP is there because of him and out of a desire to make him happy." [...] Similarly, James Poniewozik of Time praised the performance of Elisabeth Moss, exclaiming that [...] "she has come a long way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Andrew Barker of Variety {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, stating, [...] "The stock dismissal 'more of the same' {{has rarely been}} more accurately applied to a sequel than to The Hangover Part II, which ranks {{as little more than}} a faded copy of its predecessor superimposed on a more brightly colored background". Christy Lemire of the Associated Press said, [...] "Giving the people what they want is one thing.

[...] Carte's agency supplied additional singers, including Alice May (Aline), Giulia Warwick (Constance), and Richard Temple (Sir Marmaduke). [...] Finally, in early November 1877, the last role, that of the title character, John Wellington Wells, was filled by comedian George Grossmith. [...] Grossmith had appeared in charity performances of Trial by Jury, where both Sullivan and Gilbert had seen him (indeed, Gilbert had directed one such performance, in which Grossmith played the judge), and Gilbert had earlier commented favourably on his performance in Tom Robertson's Society at the Gallery of Illustration. [...] After singing for Sullivan, upon meeting Gilbert, Grossmith wondered aloud if the role shouldn't be played by [...] "a fine man with a fine voice".

The latter has confirmed that Joe told him by phone to cover up the cracked cylinders and to send them out, and later gave a false promise to Steve that he would account for the shipment on the day of arrest. George insists his sister Ann cannot marry Chris Keller, son of the man who destroyed the Deevers.

Daniel Wilcox of 411mania.com described the song as [...] "a sassy and soulful number {{along the lines of}} Amy Winehouse's bigger singles, only more powerful and sexy, and that much more vocally impressive". Digital Spy music editor Nick Levine wrote that [...] "Mama Do (Uh Oh, Uh Oh)" [...] "is a soulful slice of retro-pop that lands somewhere between the realms of Duffy and Natasha Bedingfield". In a positive review for the BBC Chart Blog, Fraser McAlpine commented that the song [...] "is mined from the same gently retro school of blues that guided Duffy to all those Brit awards earlier in the year". He also wrote that [...] "he melody smacks of a less bleak retelling of Amy Winehouse's 'Back To Black', as performed by the Sugababes".|$|E

Religious organizations exist to foster the interests of persons subscribing to the same religious faith. Not so of for-profit corporations.

2500|$|The {{discovery}} of incommensurable ratios was indicative of another problem facing the Greeks: {{the relation of}} the discrete to the continuous. Brought into light by Zeno of Elea, who questioned the conception that quantities are discrete and composed of a finite number of units of a given size. Past Greek conceptions dictated that they necessarily must be, for “whole numbers represent discrete objects, and a commensurable ratio represents a relation between two collections of discrete objects.” However Zeno found that in fact “ in general are not discrete collections of units; this is why ratios of incommensurable [...] appear….uantities are, in other words, continuous.” What this means is that, contrary to the popular conception of the time, there cannot be an indivisible, smallest unit of measure for any quantity. That in fact, these divisions of quantity must necessarily be infinite. For example, consider a line segment: this segment can be split in half, that half split in half, the half of the half in half, and so on. This process can continue infinitely, for there is always another half to be split. The more times the segment is halved, the closer the unit of measure comes to zero, but it never reaches exactly zero. This <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> Zeno sought to prove. He sought to prove this by formulating four paradoxes, which demonstrated the contradictions inherent in the mathematical thought of the time. While Zeno’s paradoxes accurately demonstrated the deficiencies of current mathematical conceptions, they were not regarded as proof of the alternative. In the minds of the Greeks, disproving the validity of one view did not necessarily prove the validity of another, and therefore further investigation had to occur.|$|E
2500|$|Künneth {{begins by}} noting that [...] "the {{bankruptcy}} of a secularized theology {{in the face of}} the resurrection is (of course) largely due to Schleiermacher", who maintained that the spiritual presence of Jesus and his influence on the disciples he left behind was not contingent on any news of the facts of Christ's resurrection (p.16). Ritschl added to the confusion by approaching from the other direction: the qualities of the exalted Christ are already contained in his existence in time. Künneth sees this as enormously over-simplistic, and notes wryly, of those who conclude that Christ's resurrection was largely a [...] "vision" [...] of the fervent would-be apostles, that Jesus himself taught that visions from beyond the grave would not alter the religious experience of men (the parable of Lazarus and Dives, Luke 16:29ff). Künneth argues that [...] "the resurrection of Jesus cannot be cut out of" [...] the Christian kerygma/message (p.36) : [...] for that would leave us merely with matters for psychic or sociological investigation, however inadequate, scientifically, these explanations would be to account for the duration, intensity, and persistence of the Christian faith (and here, one cannot help but think of William James's Varieties of Religious Experience). To imagine Dogma to be what Matthew Arnold took it to be, the Aberglaube, or added Belief above and beyond the Facts, would be to imprison Christianity forever within the continuum of space and time, which for Künneth, is subject to uncertainty and mortality and subjectivity. This, in fact, <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> Adolf Harnack had done in Germany, as Arnold was writing in England : Dogma was interpreted, via Higher Criticism, to be a Greek addition to the pure New Testament.|$|E
