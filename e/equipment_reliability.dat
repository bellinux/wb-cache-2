50|$|The <b>Equipment</b> <b>Reliability</b> Information System (ERIS) {{collects}} {{and produces}} component outage data for generation and transmission systems. The Electric Power System Performance Assessment (EPSRA) protocols cover bulk system performance assessment, significant power interruptions and service continuity data. The ERIS and EPSRA methodologies developed {{for collecting data}} using {{a common set of}} definitions are now accepted as Canadian electric power industry standards. Both ERIS and EPSRA are national systems that have the strong support of Canada’s electric power utilities. The models and techniques developed in Billinton’s research program have provided considerable impetus to the development of suitable protocols for component and system outage data collection.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary goal}} of {{maintenance}} is to avoid or mitigate the consequences of failure of equipment. This may be by preventing the failure before it actually occurs which Planned Maintenance and Condition Based Maintenance help to achieve. It is designed to preserve and restore <b>equipment</b> <b>reliability</b> by replacing worn components before they actually fail. Maintenance activities include partial or complete overhauls at specified periods, oil changes, lubrication, minor adjustments, and so on. In addition, workers can record equipment deterioration so they know to replace or repair worn parts before they cause system failure. The ideal machine maintenance program would prevent any unnecessary and costly repairs.|$|E

50|$|Quantitative Requirements are {{specified}} using reliability parameters. The {{most common}} reliability parameter is the mean {{time to failure}} (MTTF), which can also be specified as the failure rate (this is expressed as a frequency or conditional probability density function (PDF)) or the number of failures during a given period. These parameters may be useful for higher system levels and systems that are operated frequently (i.e. vehicles, machinery, and electronic <b>equipment).</b> <b>Reliability</b> increases as the MTTF increases. The MTTF is usually specified in hours, but can also be used with other units of measurement, such as miles or cycles.

5000|$|In March 2010, the rig {{experienced}} {{problems that}} included drilling mud {{falling into the}} undersea oil formation, sudden gas releases, a pipe falling into the well and at least three occasions of the blowout preventer leaking fluid. [...] The rig's mechanic stated that the well had problems for months and that the drill repeatedly kicked due to resistance from high gas pressure. On March 10, a BP executive e-mailed the Minerals Management Service about a stuck pipe and well control situation at the drilling site, and stated that BP would have to plugback the well. [...] A confidential survey commissioned by Transocean weeks before the explosion stated that workers were concerned about safety practices and feared reprisals if they reported mistakes or other problems. The survey raised concerns [...] "about poor <b>equipment</b> <b>reliability,</b> which they believed {{was a result of}} drilling priorities taking precedence over maintenance."

5000|$|Reason {{considers}} {{an ideal}} safety culture [...] "the ‘engine’ {{that drives the}} system towards the goal of sustaining the maximum resistance towards its operational hazards" [...] regardless of current commercial concerns or leadership style. This requires a constant high level of respect for anything that might defeat safety systems and ‘not forgetting to be afraid’. Complex systems with defence-in-depth (such {{as would be expected}} for a major hazard plant) become opaque to most if not all of their managers and operators. Their design should ensure that no single failure will lead to an accident, or even to a revealed near-miss, and there are no timely reminders to be afraid. For such systems, Reason argues, there is an ‘absence of sufficient accidents to steer by’ and the desired state of ‘intelligent and respectful wariness’ will be lost unless sustained by the collection, analysis and dissemination of knowledge from incidents and revealed near misses. It is very dangerous to think that an organization is safe because no information is saying otherwise, but it is also very easy. An organisation that underestimates danger will be insufficiently concerned about poor working conditions, poor working practices, poor <b>equipment</b> <b>reliability,</b> and even identified deficiencies in the defences-in-depth: the plant is still safe ‘by massive margins’, so why rock the boat? Hence, without conscious efforts to prevent it, complex systems with major hazards are both particularly vulnerable to (and particularly prone to develop) a poor safety culture.|$|E
