5|$|After the {{disaster}} caused by Hurricane Mitch, {{countries around the}} world donated significant aid, totaling $6.3billion (1998USD). Throughout Central America, which was recovering from an economic crisis that occurred in 1996, many wished to continue the growth of the infrastructure and economy. In addition, after witnessing the vulnerability to hurricanes, the affected governments endeavored to prevent such a disaster <b>from</b> <b>occurring</b> again.|$|E
25|$|Pollution can <b>occur</b> <b>from</b> on-site {{sanitation}} systems, landfills, effluent from {{wastewater treatment}} plants, leaking sewers, petrol filling stations or from over application of fertilizers in agriculture. Pollution (or contamination) can also <b>occur</b> <b>from</b> naturally <b>occurring</b> contaminants, such as arsenic or fluoride. Using polluted groundwater causes hazards {{to public health}} through poisoning or the spread of disease.|$|R

5|$|Commercially, apples can {{be stored}} for some months in {{controlled}} atmosphere chambers to delay ethylene-induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations {{of carbon dioxide and}} high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening <b>from</b> <b>occurring</b> too quickly. Ripening continues when the fruit is removed from storage.|$|E
5|$|The {{chelating}} {{ability of}} amino acids {{has been used}} in fertilizers for agriculture to facilitate the delivery of minerals to plants in order to correct mineral deficiencies, such as iron chlorosis. These fertilizers are also used to prevent deficiencies <b>from</b> <b>occurring</b> and improving the overall health of the plants. The remaining production of amino acids is used in the synthesis of drugs and cosmetics.|$|E

5000|$|For {{chelating}} ligands, the monophosphine palladium {{species is}} not formed; oxidative addition, amide formation and reductive elimination <b>occur</b> <b>from</b> L2Pd complexes. The Hartwig group found that [...] "reductive elimination can <b>occur</b> <b>from</b> either a four-coordinate bisphosphine or three-coordinate monophosphine arylpalladium amido complex. Eliminations from the three-coordinate compounds are faster. Second, β-hydrogen elimination <b>occurs</b> <b>from</b> a three-coordinate intermediate. Therefore, β-hydrogen elimination <b>occurs</b> slowly <b>from</b> arylpalladium complexes containing chelating phosphines while reductive elimination can still <b>occur</b> <b>from</b> these four-coordinate species." ...|$|R

5|$|Tropical Depression Sixteen-E {{formed from}} a {{disturbance}} in the intertropical convergence zone. Despite being {{located in a}} hostile environment, it managed to organize into a tropical depression on November 14. It was briefly forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm. However, wind shear prevented that <b>from</b> <b>occurring.</b> Consequently, the depression degenerated into a remnant low on November 16 and dissipated soon after that.|$|E
5|$|With {{epoxides}} and aziridines {{the reaction}} {{serves as a}} ring-expansion to produce the corresponding oxetane or azetidine. The long reaction times required for these reactions prevent them <b>from</b> <b>occurring</b> as significant side reactions when synthesizing epoxides and aziridines.|$|E
5|$|A prohibiting order {{operates}} {{to prevent}} illegal action {{by a public}} authority <b>from</b> <b>occurring</b> in the first place. It may be granted by the High Court {{in cases where the}} applicant is aware that the authority is about to take an unlawful course of action, or to prevent the authority from repeating an unlawful act. Like a quashing order, a prohibiting order is used to help maintain good standards of public administration.|$|E

5|$|Alan begins {{driving the}} car down the road, and sees Frank Jr. and Betty in front of him. They look behind to wave to Alan, and he waves back. However, the pair keep driving while looking backwards. Observing that a {{railroad}} with an oncoming train is near, Alan desperately tries to signal to them to stop waving and look ahead. When they do not pay attention to him and continue waving, Alan shields his eyes as the two drive right {{into the path of}} the train and are killed. Back in the present, at the funeral, Hal enters his police car, and decides to go back on the road in order to prevent more traffic accidents <b>from</b> <b>occurring.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jumpscares {{are present}} {{in all of the}} series' main games, and occur when any animatronic manages to reach and attack the player-{{character}}. Most jumpscares involve an animatronic character suddenly appearing in the player's view, followed by a loud, bellowing sound. Some jumpscares, including those of Golden Freddy, Nightmare, and Nightmarionne, consist of a single screen supplemented with shrill, distorted audio. These jumpscares usually crash or restart the game. The player can utilise the tools listed above to prevent attacks, thus preventing any jumpscares <b>from</b> <b>occurring.</b>|$|E
5|$|President Bush's legacy {{continues}} to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack <b>from</b> <b>occurring</b> in the US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies {{such as the}} Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to {{his handling of the}} Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis—as proof that George W. Bush was unfit to be president.|$|E

5|$|The {{area was}} poised to become a state park in 1903, but a veto by Governor Richard Yates {{prevented}} that <b>from</b> <b>occurring.</b> Supporters continued to press for the White Pines Woods, as it was once known, to receive state park designation throughout the period 1903-1927. In 1927 the park was established with help from supporters in the Chicago media. The park contains two freshwater streams, dolomite rock formations, {{and a variety of}} activities generally associated with Illinois state parks. Along Pine Creek, one of the park's two streams, fords were constructed instead of bridges allowing visitors to drive through the creek.|$|E
5|$|The murders {{occurred}} eleven {{days before}} the Maryland Democratic Party's primary election to determine its candidate for the Prince George's County sheriff. As there were no candidates running for sheriff in any other parties, {{the winner of the}} primary election would automatically run unopposed in the general election itself. The incumbent sheriff lost reelection to the union president, who vowed to implement new measures to prevent a similar incident <b>from</b> <b>occurring</b> in the future.|$|E

5|$|Two {{to three}} tablespoons of ReaLemon lemon juice has the {{equivalent}} of the juice from one average-sized lemon. Both ReaLemon and ReaLime are used as ingredients in various recipes, such as in baking, grilling, and as an ingredient in marinades and salad dressings. ReaLemon can be used as an ingredient in hot tea, lemonade and hot lemonade, and in various cooked dishes and baked goods such as pies. ReaLemon and other lemon juices can be used to prevent browning discoloration <b>from</b> <b>occurring</b> in peeled or sliced potatoes. This is performed by soaking the sliced potatoes in a mixture of the lemon juice and water. Both ReaLemon and ReaLime must be refrigerated after the bottles are opened.|$|E
5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court commanding a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority <b>from</b> <b>occurring</b> in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, {{has the effect of}} invalidating an ultra vires decision made by an authority. Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to apply for the order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{accident}} investigation found that procedures and policies were supposedly {{already in place}} to prevent such a crash <b>from</b> <b>occurring</b> again, {{the fact that this}} crash occurred showed that in at least one instance, the existing safety policies and their enforcement had been grievously inadequate. To re-emphasize the importance of adherence to existing safety policies and correcting the actions of anyone violating them at any time, the USAF quickly distributed the findings of {{the accident}} investigation throughout the service. These measures failed to prevent – sixteen years later – the occurrence in almost identical circumstances of another accident, when a C-17 transport aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, on an aerial-display practice flight.|$|E
