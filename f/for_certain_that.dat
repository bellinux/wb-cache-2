No records of Neaira exist after the trial. Modern commentators have noted the weaknesses in Apollodorus' arguments, though as the outcome of an Athenian trial depended heavily on what the parties involved could persuade the jury to accept, {{and how much of}} their dishonesty they could get away with, we cannot say <b>for</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> the suit failed.|$|E
5|$|In 244 CE, Philip the Arab {{transformed}} Flavius Neapolis into a Roman colony named Julia Neapolis. It retained this status {{until the}} rule of Trebonianus Gallus in 251 CE. The Encyclopaedia Judaica speculates that Christianity was dominant in the 2nd or 3rd century, with some sources positing a later date of 480 CE. It is known <b>for</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> a bishop from Nablus participated in the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE. The presence of Samaritans in the city is attested to in literary and epigraphic evidence dating to the 4th century CE.

5|$|It is {{not evident}} in medieval Muslim sources when Muhanna died {{or when the}} post of amir al-ʿarab was {{stripped}} from him. It is known <b>for</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> prior to the Mamluk conquest of Syria in 1260, the amir al-ʿarab was Muhanna's uncle Ali ibn Haditha. The circumstances of Isa's replacement of Ali are also unclear. In some versions, Isa was appointed by Sultan Qutuz {{as a reward for}} his support in the Battle of Ain Jalut against the Mongols {{in the latter half of}} 1260, though the sources indicate that Isa and his Bedouin horsemen refrained from actually participating in the battle. In another version, Qutuz's successor Baybars appointed Isa as a reward for assisting him during his 1250s exile in Syria (in this version, Ali was stripped of the title as punishment for denying Baybars refuge). In any case, it is known that Baybars issued a diploma confirming Isa as amir al-ʿarab and recognizing his iqtaʿat (fiefs) in 1260/61. Among his iqta'at were half of Salamiyah, which was separated from the iqtaʿ of Hama, and Sarmin. Baybars also entrusted the Al Fadl and the other Bedouin tribes of the Syrian desert and steppe with guarding the Syrian frontier with Mongol Ilkhanid-held Iraq.|$|E

But when Alves dos Reis says that, during the 19th century, with the invasion of polkas, mazurkas, galops, country dances and other musical genres in Cape Verde, the morna was not influenced, it suggests that by that time the morna was already a fully formed and mature musical genre.|$|E
25|$|On 13 October 2005 Straw took {{questions}} {{from a public}} panel of individuals in a BBC Newsnight television special {{on the subject of}} Iraq, addressing widespread public concerns about the exit strategy for British troops, the Iraqi insurgency and, inevitably, the moral legitimacy of the war. On several occasions Straw reiterated his position that the decision to invade was in his opinion the right thing to do, but said he did not 'know' <b>for</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> this was the case. He said he understood why public opinion on several matters might differ from his own—a Newsnight/ICM poll showed over 70% of respondents believed the war in Iraq to have increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks in Britain, but Straw said he could not agree based on the information presented to him.|$|E

500|$|Hill {{started to}} {{participate}} in climbing competitions in the mid-1980s, but {{one of her first}} significant accomplishments was in 1979. She became the first person to free climb Ophir Broke in Ophir, Colorado, which has a difficulty rating of 5.12d and was the hardest route ever climbed by a woman at that time. It was the hardest crack climb in Colorado at the time and there were only one or two harder ones in Yosemite. Long was amazed by her feat. He has said [...] "that's when I knew <b>for</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> this woman had extraordinary talent". The regional guidebook credits Long with the first free ascent of the route; Hill speculates {{the reason for this is}} that at the time she was an unknown climber and known only as Long's partner and protege. In her autobiography, Hill explains that it was during this climb that she realized it is not a person's size or strength but ability to be creative on the rock that is important: [...] "The big lesson for me... was to realize that despite what appeared to be a limitation due to my small stature, I could create my own method of getting past a difficult section of rock. John's size and power enabled him to make long reaches and explosive lunge moves that were completely out of my range. I, on the other hand, often found small intermediate holds that John couldn't even imagine gripping... Short or tall, man or woman, the rock is an objective medium that is equally open for interpretation by all." ...|$|E

2500|$|George Orwell, {{author of}} Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four, wrote in 1946 that [...] "the Russian regime will either democratize itself {{or it will}} perish".

2500|$|Like the British Museum's other {{spectacular}} work in Roman glass, the cameo glass Portland Vase, the cup represents to {{some extent}} the extension of skills developed by cutters of engraved gems, or the larger hardstone carving of vessels in semi-precious stones, which were luxury arts with enormous prestige in ancient Rome. [...] No carved gemstone vessels directly comparable to either work are known, but the general taste behind these extreme exhibitions of glass-making skill is one formed by objects in natural stones like the Coupe des Ptolémées or the Rubens Vase. Indeed, {{it was not until}} the first full studies of the cup in 1950 that it was established <b>for</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> the material was glass and not a gemstone, which had previously been in question.|$|E
2500|$|Another common {{assumption}} {{is that none of}} the exoteric works is extant – that all of Aristotle's extant writings are of the esoteric kind. Current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious, though many of them may have been in dialogue form. (Fragments of some of Aristotle's dialogues have survived.) Perhaps it is to these that Cicero refers when he characterized Aristotle's writing style as [...] "a river of gold"; it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to us.

2500|$|Perhaps {{there was}} already an {{informal}} public understanding of some connection between disease resistance and working with cattle. The [...] "beautiful milkmaid" [...] {{seems to have been}} a frequent image in the art and literature of this period. But it is known <b>for</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> in the years following 1770, at least six people in England and Germany (Sevel, Jensen, Jesty 1774, Rendall, Plett 1791) tested successfully the possibility of using the cowpox vaccine as an immunization for smallpox in humans. [...] In 1796, Sarah Nelmes, a local milkmaid, contracted cowpox and went to Jenner for treatment. Jenner took the opportunity to test his theory. He inoculated James Phipps, the eight-year-old son of his gardener, with material taken from the cowpox lesions on Sarah's hand. After a mild fever and the expected local lesion James recovered after a few days. About two months later Jenner inoculated James on both arms with material from a case of smallpox, with no effect; the boy was immune to smallpox.|$|E
2500|$|However, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} the play may have been written several years earlier. Robert Greene's pamphlet Greene's Groats-Worth of Wit (entered in the Stationers' Register on 20 September 1592) mocks Shakespeare as [...] "an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his 'tiger's heart wrapped in a player's hide', supposes that he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you." [...] This parody of 3 Henry VI, 1.4.138, where York refers to Margaret as a [...] "tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide!", proves that 3 Henry VI was well known by September 1592, which means it must have been staged before 23 June, when the government closed the theatres {{to prevent the spread of}} plague. As it is known <b>for</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> 3 Henry VI was a sequel to 2 Henry VI, it is certain that if 3 Henry VI was on stage by June 1592, so too was 2 Henry VI and that both were probably written in 1591 or 1592.|$|E
