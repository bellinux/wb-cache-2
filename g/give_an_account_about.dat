The rate of the flooded area is significant in the country. The average runoff of surface water exceeds hundred billion cubic meters. Streams and rivers from the surrounding area flow together with the Danube River into the Black sea.

40|$|The Kalabari {{people of}} Nigeria {{live in the}} Niger Delta, four degrees above the equator. For several hundred years they have traded {{textiles}} and other artifacts across the Sahara and by sea. They use these imported items as visible markers to differentiate them from other Nigerian ethnic groups. Within Kalabari society, textiles also distinguish one lineage group from another, and are often described as "belonging" specifically to a lineage. In addition to textiles, necklaces, particularly Italian coral, canes, and beads in hats, are part of men's and women's ensembles relating to hierarchies of age and social positions within each gender. One specific pillbox style hat, worn by several women in the Jackreece lineage is decorated with many large (3 - 4 inches long) and fragile, blown-glass lace beads, claimed to be of Venetian origin and {{dating back to the}} late 1800 s (Francis 1994 : 6).

Watson is {{a gateway}} to the Semantic Web: it collects, {{analyzes}} and gives access to ontologies and semantic data available online {{with the objective of}} supporting their dynamic exploitation by semantic applications.

Our main conclusions are 1 - that the Semantic Web is characterized by a large number of small, lightweight ontologies and a small number of large-scale, heavyweight ontologies, and 2 - that important efforts still need to be spent on improving the published ontologies (coverage of different topic domains, connectedness of the semantic data, etc.) and the tools that produce and manipulate them. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A well studied {{family of}} random fractals called fractal {{percolation}} is discussed. We {{focus on the}} projections of fractal percolation on the plane. Our goal is to present stronger versions of the classical Marstrand theorem, valid for almost every realization of fractal percolation. The extensions go in three directions: • the statements work for all directions, not almost all, • the statements are true for more general projections, for ex-ample radial projections onto a circle, • in the case dimH> 1, each projection has not only positive Lebesgue measure but also has nonempty interior. 1. introduction To model turbulence, Mandelbrot [13, 14] introduced a statistically self-similar family of random Cantor sets. Since that time this fam-ily has got at least three names in the literature: fractal percolation, Mandelbrot percolation and canonical curdling, among which we will use the first one. In 1996 Lincoln Chayes [3] published <b>an</b> excellent survey <b>giving</b> <b>an</b> <b>account</b> <b>about</b> the most important results known in that time. His survey focused on the percolation related properties while we place emphasis on the geometric measure theoretical properties (projections and slices) of fractal percolation sets.

40|$|The use of term-rewriting systems (TRSs) is at {{the core}} of {{automated}} theorem proving (ATP). There are a number of methods whereby we can build terminating TRSs with full deduction power, with respect to some theory. Yet, there exist theories these techniques cannot handle, <b>giving</b> rise to <b>a</b> trade-off between deduction power and termination. One such theory is the theory of observation congruence [Milner, 1989 b] in CCS [Milner, 1989 a]. The standard approach to overcome this situation is to use meta-level information; it, however, introduces the problem of finding and capturing such meta-level control. This paper advocates the use of annotated TRSs (ATRSs) for approaching these problems; the annotations are used to capture meta-level information that helps direct proof search, while <b>giving</b> <b>an</b> intuitive <b>account</b> <b>about</b> why and how rewriting is expected to work.

The approach is shape-based and works towards recognition under {{a broad range}} of circumstances, from varied lighting conditions to affine transformations. The main emphasis is on its neural elements that allow the system to learn to recognize objects about which it has no prior information.

Under the influence of Hellenistic historiography Antias related his stories very long-winded and filled with sensationalism to entertain his readers. He embroidered the mostly short accounts of older historians with dramatic details and also recounted legends and miracles. He falsified the report about the trials of the Scipio brothers (compare Livy 38.50-60) and seems to have invented high offices and deeds of members of his house, the gens Valeria, who lived in the early Roman republic because there were no reliable sources about these early times, which could have disproved his assertions.

The ensuing pressure from the Fellows induced the Council to reinstate Russell. In January 1920, it was announced that Russell had accepted the reinstatement offer from Trinity and would begin lecturing from October. In July 1920, Russell applied for a one year leave of absence; this was approved. He spent the year giving lectures in China and Japan. In January 1921, it was announced by Trinity that Russell had resigned and his resignation had been accepted. This resignation, Hardy explains, was completely voluntary and was not the result of another altercation.|$|R
40|$|According to many realist {{philosophers}} of fiction, {{one needs}} to posit an ontology of existing fictional characters in order to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> correct <b>account</b> of discourse <b>about</b> fiction.

On that basis, pretense theorists claim that one {{does not need to}} embrace an ontology of fictional characters to <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>account</b> of discourse <b>about</b> fiction. The ontolog-ical dispute between realists and pretense theorists is mainly a dispute {{in the realm of the}} phi-losophy of language concerning the status relative to pretense of discourse about fiction. Realists are persuaded that there is a sharp line between discourse in fiction and discourse about fiction while pretense theorists deny there exists such a line. I suggest that realists may have a wrong picture of discourse in fiction since, in many cases, discourse in fiction already contains many occurrences of discourse about fiction. Consequently, discourse about fiction, instead of ending fiction, should be regarded, following pretense theorists, as adding extra lay-ers of fiction...|$|R

This practice involved naming newborns after the names of conquered tribes and people. Names such as 'Baskord' (from the Bashkirs), 'Imek' (from the Kimeks), 'Kitan' (from the Mongol Khitan people), and 'Urus' were used by the Cumans. Friar William of Rubruk, a Franciscan traveler who visited the Mongols in 1253-55, provides another account of Cuman customs. He mentions that Cumans built statues for dead notables, facing east and holding a cup (these statues {{are not to be}} confused with the balbals, which represent the enemies that were killed by him). He also notes that for richer notables, the Cumans built tombs in the form of houses. Rubruk <b>gives</b> <b>an</b> eyewitness <b>account</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> man who had recently died: the Cumans had hung up sixteen horses' hides, in groups of four, between high poles, facing the four points of the compass.

40|$|While some {{computational}} {{models of}} intelligence test problems were proposed throughout {{the second half}} of the XXth century, in the first years of the XXIst century we have seen an increasing number of computer systems being able to score well on particular intelligence test tasks. However, despite this increasing trend there has been no general account of all these works in terms of how they relate to each other and what their real achievements are. Also, there is poor understanding about what intelligence tests measure in machines, whether they are useful to evaluate AI systems, whether they are really challenging problems, and whether they are useful to understand (human) intelligence. In this paper, we provide some insight on these issues, in the form of nine specific questions, by <b>giving</b> <b>a</b> comprehensive <b>account</b> of <b>about</b> thirty computer models, from the 1960 s to nowadays, and their relationships, focussing on the range of intelligence test tasks they address, the purpose of the models, how general or specialised these models are, the AI techniques they use in each case, their comparison with human performance, and their evaluation of item difficulty. As a conclusion, these tests and the computer models attempting them show that AI is still lacking general techniques to deal with a variety of problems at the same time. Nonetheless, a renewed attention on these problems and a more careful understanding of what intelligence tests offer for AI may help build new bridges between psychometrics, cognitive science, and AI; and may motivate new kinds of problem repositories...|$|R
