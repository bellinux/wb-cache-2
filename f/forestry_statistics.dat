Thus, this paper aimed to detect patterns of systematic management and cutting in Pinus sp. We evaluated four stands of Pinus unknown ages using the MLME (linear spectral mixture modeling technique) using TM (Thematic Mapper) data from Landsat- 5 satellite. Therefore, the variation of the vegetation, soil and shade fractions were observed over an experimental area in the period from 2001 to 2011. It was possible to detect systematic and selective cutting management patterns using both shade and soil fractions. Also, the systematic cutting has been validated with high resolution imagery. According to this study, we analyze patterns of management on stands of Pinus using the Linear Spectral Mixture. To identify these patterns, the fraction shadow {{can be used to}} analyze the use of the first systematic handling while the fraction soil can be used to analyze the second management systematic and also to manage selective.

This model corrects for biases in pollen percentages caused by inter-taxonomic differences in pollen productivity and dispersal. This paper presents the first case study to validate REVEALS, using empirical data from southern Sweden. Percentage cover of modern regional vegetation in Skane and Smaland, two contrasting vegetation regions, was predicted with REVEALS for 26 key taxa, using pollen assemblages from surface sediments in 10 large lakes, and compared to the actual vegetation within 10 (4) km(2) compiled from satellite data, <b>forestry</b> inventories, crop <b>statistics,</b> aerial photographs, and vegetation inventories. REVEALS works well in predicting the percentage cover of large vegetation units such as total trees (wooded land), total herbs (open land), total conifers and total broad-leaved trees, and it provides reasonable estimates for individual taxa, including Pinus, Picea, Betula, Corylus, Alnus, Tilia, Sahx spp., Juniperus, Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Cerealia and Secale. The results show great potential for REVEALS applications, including (1) quantitative reconstructions of past regional land cover important for palaeoclimatology and nature conservation, and (2) local-scale reconstruction of vegetation (< 1 km(2) up to similar to 5 km(2) area) relevant for palaeoecology and archaeology...|$|R

We present a comprehensive assessment of global HANPP based on vegetation modeling, agricultural and <b>forestry</b> <b>statistics,</b> and geographical information systems data on land use, land cover, and soil degradation that localizes human impact on ecosystems. We found an aggregate global HANPP value of 15. 6 Pg C/yr or 23. 8 % of potential net primary productivity, of which 53 % was contributed by harvest, 40 % by land-use-induced productivity changes, and 7 % by human-induced fires. This is a remarkable impact on the biosphere caused by just one species. We present maps quantifying human-induced changes in trophic energy flows in ecosystems that illustrate spatial patterns in the human domination of ecosystems, thus emphasizing land use as a pervasive factor of global importance. Land use transforms earth's terrestrial surface, resulting in changes in biogeochemical cycles and {{in the ability of}} ecosystems to deliver services critical to human well being.

The objective of the BIRS workshop was to facilitate interaction between statisticians and researchers that study forest fires and forest ecology. One theme that emerged in several of the keynote talks {{as well as in the}} roundtable discussions was the importance of melding science with statistics. In some of the talks, physically reasonable differential equation models as well as other types of deterministic models were augmented to incorporate the natural variability inherent in some of the systems observed (e. g. animal trajectories, weather, fire behaviour). It is likely that advances in <b>forestry</b> science and <b>statistics</b> will be made rapidly, if these types of approaches are emulated in other situations.

40|$|A {{range of}} methodological {{frameworks}} {{is available to}} assist decision-makers with evaluations of projects concerned with biodiversity conservation (the protection, management or restoration of biodiversity), but their uptake has been relatively limited. Some researchers suggest a lack of research interest to be one contributory factor, in particular {{in relation to the}} application of interdisciplinary approaches that integrate methods from the natural and social sciences, despite the insights that such approaches can bring. We evaluated this assertion by examining the provenance of some examples of current research in this area. Specifically, we compared two exemplar papers published in a conservation journal and one in an interdisciplinary ecological economics journal. We scored the cited references in each paper according to standard subject categories. These scores were then weighted and aggregated to give an overall quantified subject category distribution {{for each of the three}} focal papers. Comparison of the three papers revealed an expected dominance of subject categories most closely aligned with ecological science. However, there were different patterns of provenance in the three papers. One paper from the conservation journal was dominated by citations of other papers in the biodiversity conservation literature. The second paper from the conservation journal and the paper from the ecological economics journal displayed similar overall patterns of disciplinary provenance, although they diverged in disciplinary provenance for the less commonly cited disciplines, such as the social sciences. Our results suggest that research in biodiversity project evaluation may be developing along at least three, relatively distinct, pathways rather than as a genuinely interconnected research theme. This is likely to hinder progress in research but also in practical application of the techniques, in terms of reducing the likelihood of identifying inadequate, inappropriate or inefficient conservation investments. There is still considerable opportunity for further collaboration in the areas of biodiversity evaluation among researchers in a range of disciplines, including ecology, economics, <b>statistics,</b> <b>forestry</b> and wildlife management. Biodiversity conservation evaluation is a growing field, but its potential is unlikely to be fulfilled unless biodiversity researchers seek to develop a more integrated community, and particularly, to learn from researchers in other disciplines where evaluation has a longer history. © 2013 CSIRO...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the forestry sector {{in the last two}} decades in Romania has been significantly influenced by the post 1989 political and economic changes, forest restitution and the European Union accession process. Based on the analysis of <b>forestry</b> <b>statistics,</b> legislation and institutional changes this paper underlines the main developments in the forestry sector in the last twenty years and the linkages with other sectors that had an impact on its development. The significant change in forest ownership (based on which 45 % of the Romanian forest is nowadays in non-state hands), the unprecedented re-organisation of the forest sector through the institutional separation of the regulatory, control and forest management functions, the changes in forest administration (including the establishment of more than 110 private forest districts) and the full privatisation of the wood harvesting and processing sector complemented by foreign investments have shaped the forest sector development in a context in which the forest resource remained almost unchanged. Major developments have been recorded in the establishment and management of large protected areas as National Forest Administration Romsilva is currently administrating 22 national and nature parks. Both positive and negative interactions of forestry with environmental protection, wood processing, agriculture, rural development, road infrastructure and tourism sectors have also impacted the {{evolution of}} the forest sector.

However, its potential is still uncertain in China, especially with respect to its spatial distribution. In this paper, the quantity and distribution of Chinese forest biomass energy resources are explored based mainly on <b>forestry</b> <b>statistics</b> data rather than forest resource inventory data used by most previous studies. The results show that the forest biomass energy resource in China was 169 million tons in 2010, of which wood felling and bucking residue (WFBR),wood processing residue (WPR), bamboo processing residue, fuel wood and firewood used by farmers accounted for 38 %, 37 %, 6 %, 4 % and 15 %, respectively. The highest resource was located in East China, accounting for nearly 39. 0 % of the national amount, followed by the Southwest and South China regions, which accounted for 17. 4 % and 16. 3 %, respectively. At the provincial scale, Shandong has the highest distribution, accounting for 11. 9 % of total resources, followed by Guangxi and Fujian accounting for 10. 3 % and 10. 2 %, respectively. The actual wood-processing residue (AWPR) estimated from the actual production of different wood products (considering the wood transferred between regions) showed apparent differences from the local wood processing residue (LWPR), which assumes that no wood has been transferredbetween regions. Due to the large contribution of WPR to total forestry bioenergy resources, the estimation of AWPR will provide a more accurate evaluation of the total amount and the spatial distribution of forest biomass energy resources in China...|$|E

Accounting for uncertainty {{in the proportion of}} harvest occurring during the breeding season and in avian nesting densities, our estimate ranges from 616 thousand to 2. 09 million nests. Estimates of the impact on numbers of individuals recruited into the adult breeding population were made based on the application of survivorship estimates at various stages of the life cycle. Future improvements to this estimate are expected as better and more extensive avian breeding pair density estimates become available and as provincial <b>forestry</b> <b>statistics</b> become more refined, spatially and temporally. The effect of incidental take due to forestry is not uniform and is disproportionately centered in the southern boreal. Those species whose ranges occur primarily in these regions are most at risk for industrial forestry in general and for incidental take in particular. Refinements to the nest loss estimate for industrial forestry in Canada will be achieved primarily through the provision of more accurate estimates of the area of forest harvested annually during the breeding season stratified by forest type and Bird Conservation Region (BCR). A better understanding of survivorship among life-history stages for forest birds would also allow for better modeling of the effect of nest loss on adult recruitment. Finally, models are needed to project legacy effects of forest harvesting on avian populations that take into account forest succession and accompanying cumulative effects of landscape change...|$|E

The study evealed 96 types of transitions between land cover categories, aggregated into 10 groups corresponding to driving processes. It was found that the main processes of land cover transformations is related to both natural and anthropogenic origins. Cropping and deforestation are anthropogenic processes, flooding and draining are the principal natural ones. Transformation of cultivated lands and reforestation are combined natural and anthropogenic. The contribution of natural factors is higher in the states of the North (Amazonia) and the Northeast macroregions; in the Center-West and the South anthropogenic factors make larger contribution. We have also detected considerable land use/land cover changes caused by agricultural development in densely populated states of the Southeast and the South. In both macroregions planted area expands due to increase of soybeans and sugar cane production, while area of pastures is shrinking. The trends of transformations of agricultural land use revealed as a result of statistical data analysis, match with transitions of land cover categories belonging to the aggregated group of cropping processes. Transformations of land cover types with predominance of shrub vegetation were the most problematic to interpret because of lack of comparable statistical data on pastures.  </p...|$|E

We have been fortunate in establishing excellent relationships with the Russian scientific community and believe we have helped to retain coherence in circumstances where the continuation of research was in doubt. We have learned much and have been effective in advancing, even establishing, scholars and programs in Russia that might not otherwise have survived the transition. The vigor of the International Boreal Forest Research Association (IBFRA) is one sign of the value and success of these activities. Largely due to the current political and economic transitions in the former Soviet Union, the forests of much of the FSU are under reduced logging pressure. In addition, there is a decline in air pollution as heavy industry has waned, at least for now. Russian <b>forestry</b> <b>statistics</b> and our personal experience indicate a decline, perhaps as high as 60 %, in forest harvesting over the last few years. But, new international market pressures on the forests exist in European Russia and in the Far East. The central government, still the "owner" of Russian forests, is having difficulty maintaining control over forest use and management particularly in the Far East and among the southern territories that have large, nonRussian ethnic populations. Extraordinarily large areas of mixed forest and grasslands, sparse or open forests, and mixed forests and tundra must be considered when calculating forest area It is insufficient to think of Russia as simply forest and nonforest Forest productivity, measured as growth of timber, appears to be in decline in all areas of Russia except in European Russia. Most information and publications on the recent history of these forests is heavily dependent on statistical data from the Soviet era. The interpretation of these data is very much open to debate. Anatoly Shwidenko, a long term collaborator and former senior scientist (mensuration) for the Soviet Committee on Forests, now a scholar at the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Vienna, has provided abundant contributions from the data available to him and from his experience. Forest stand carbon is concentrated in the Russian Far East (i. e. Primorski Kray), Central-Southern Siberia and European Russia But, soil carbon can be 10 times forest stand C. Our efforts in mapping the area and changes in area (as well as the internal structure) of forests have made major contributions to our joint understanding of the scale and status of these forests. To realize the importance of this contribution one needs only to recognize that any large scale Soviet-era maps of the area did not include latitude and longitude. Even today, there is great reluctance to provide these data, the basis of any GIS...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{review and}} {{original}} data, this synthesis investigates carbon pools and fluxes of Siberian and European forests (600 and 300 million ha, respectively). We examine {{the productivity of}} ecosystems, expressed as positive rate when {{the amount of carbon}} in the ecosystem increases, while (following micrometeorological convention) downward fluxes from the atmosphere to the vegetation (NEE=Net Ecosystem Exchange) are expressed as negative numbers. Productivity parameters are Net Primary Productivity (NPP=whole plant growth), Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP = CO 2 assimilation minus ecosystem respiration), and Net Biome Productivity (NBP=NEP minus carbon losses through disturbances bypassing respiration, e. g. by fire and logging). Based on chronosequence studies and national <b>forestry</b> <b>statistics</b> we estimate a low average NPP for boreal forests in Siberia: 123 gC m(- 2) y(- 1). This contrasts with a similar calculation for Europe which suggests a much higher average NPP of 460 gC m(- 2) y(- 1) for the forests there. Despite a smaller area, European forests have a higher total NPP than Siberia (1. 2 - 1. 6 vs. 0. 6 - 0. 9 x 10 (15) gC region(- 1) y(- 1)). This arises as a consequence of differences in growing season length, climate and nutrition. For a chronosequence of Pinus sylvestris stands studied in central Siberia during summer, NEE was most negative in a 67 -y old stand regenerating after fire (- 192 mmol m(- 2) d(- 1)) which is close to NEE in a cultivated forest of Germany (- 210 mmol m(- 2) d(- 1)). Considerable net ecosystem CO 2 -uptake was also measured in Siberia in 200 - and 215 -y old stands (NEE: 174 and - 63 mmol m(- 2) d(- 1)) while NEP of 7 - and 13 -y old logging areas were close to the ecosystem compensation point. Two Siberian bogs and a bog in European Russia were also significant carbon sinks (- 102 to - 104 mmol m(- 2) d(- 1)). Integrated over a growing season (June to September) we measured a total growing season NEE of - 14 mol m(- 2) summer(- 1) (- 168 gC m(- 2) summer(- 1)) in a 200 -y Siberian pine stand and - 5 mol m(- 2) summer(- 1) (- 60 gC m(- 2) summer(- 1)) in Siberian and European Russian bogs. By contrast, over the same period, a spruce forest in European Russia was a carbon source to the atmosphere of (NEE: + 7 mol m(- 2) summer(- 1) = + 84 gC m(- 2) summer(- 1)). Two years after a windthrow in European Russia, with all trees being uplifted and few successional species, lost 16 mol C m(- 2) to the atmosphere over a 3 -month in summer, compared to the cumulative NEE over a growing season in a German forest of - 15. 5 mol m(- 2) summer(- 1) (- 186 gC m(- 2) summer(- 1); European flux network annual averaged - 205 gC m(- 2) y(- 1)). Differences in CO 2 -exchange rates coincided with differences in the Bowen ratio, with logging areas partitioning most incoming radiation into sensible heat whereas bogs partitioned most into evaporation (latent heat). Effects of these different surface energy exchanges on local climate (convective storms and fires) and comparisons with the Canadian BOREAS experiment are discussed. Following a classification of disturbances and their effects on ecosystem carbon balances, fire and logging are discussed as the main processes causing carbon losses that bypass heterotrophic respiration in Siberia. Following two approaches, NBP was estimated to be only about 13 - 16 mmol m(- 2) y(- 1) for Siberia. It may reach 67 mmol m(- 2) y(- 1) in North America, and about 140 - 400 mmol m(- 2) y(- 1) in Scandinavia. We conclude that fire speeds up the carbon cycle, but that it results also in long-term carbon sequestration by charcoal formation. For at least 14 years after logging, regrowth forests remain net sources of CO 2 to the atmosphere. This has important implications regarding the effects of Siberian forest management on atmospheric concentrations. For many years after logging has taken place, regrowth forests remain weaker sinks for atmospheric CO 2 than are nearby old-growth forests. [Refere...|$|E
