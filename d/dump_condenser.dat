The aim of the master´s thesis is to describe the influence of network´s faults to a nuclear unit. Thesis is dealing with three fundamental problems. An influence of short circuits and power imbalance on the synchronous generator of nuclear power plant and its operation of the island network. The thesis is focused especially on the nuclear unit. However, in the case of any failure in the network, it´s necessary to check other units and their protections in the test system because unit failure could cause the disintegration of the power network. For the purposes of the simulation a test system of the power network has been developed. The test system was optimized in the LUG software, which is used to calculate the power network. Transient simulations are performed in the MODES software. Single faults are configured with scenarios. Results are generated into output files. Analysis of influence network´s faults on the synchronous generator of nuclear power plants. The ability of the synchronous generator to restore the primary steady state or hold the new steady state during changes in operating parameters of the network is one of the important parts of the safe and reliable operation of the power network. During the short circuit the damped transient actions occur. With the extension of the short circuit duration, the amplitude of the transient action increases. The risk of the stability loss of a synchronous generator increases. Therefore, the critical clearing time of a short circuit is being defined, which is the time when there is not any loss of stability. Critical clearing time of research generator is sufficient to turn off the short circuit with the help of its protection (the worst case is 0, 8 s). For example, by comparison with the hydroelectric power plant, the critical clearing time is much longer. Models of other power plants have been designed with high reliability so in the case of these faults, it doesn’t cause the disintegration of the power network. Creation of island grid is characterized by strong current surges. Units must be resistant to these surges. In the island grid fast changes of the electrical parameters often occurs. Therefore, units must respond to these changes as quickly as possible and in the broadest limits. For this purpose an island operation regulator is being used. In the case of surplus island grid in steam power plants a <b>dump</b> <b>condenser</b> can be used. This is an important ability of steam power plants because the units are able to react quickly to changes of electrical parameters in island grid. The main result of this thesis is the behavior of the nuclear power plant during various faults in the power network. Researched generator of the nuclear power plant is highly stable against faults in the power network based on the findings. The results allow to continue in this topic with real network and real unit of nuclear power plant...|$|E
