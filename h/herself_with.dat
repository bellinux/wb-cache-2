5|$|Tim Minear {{revealed}} {{the secret of}} Inara's syringe, {{as seen in the}} pilot episode; she is infected with a deadly disease.

5|$|Chibnall, having enjoyed {{when the}} Doctor and his {{companion}} were separated, {{made the decision}} for Amy to be absent {{for most of the}} episode.

5|$|In England, Anne largely {{turned from}} {{political}} {{to social and}} artistic activities. Though she participated fully {{in the life of}} James' court and maintained a court of her own, often attracting those not welcomed by James, she rarely took political sides against her husband. Whatever her private difficulties with James, she proved a diplomatic asset to him in England, conducting <b>herself</b> <b>with</b> discretion and graciousness in public. Anne played a crucial role, for example, in conveying to ambassadors and foreign visitors the prestige of the Stuart dynasty and its Danish connections.|$|E

Walter (John Noble) puts forth various theories, such as astral projection, while Peter (Joshua Jackson) thinks it was still just a dream.

Back in the isolation tank, Walternate has had Olivia extracted from the tank and directs his agents to lock her up and sedate her.|$|E

At the same time, her two female attendants Dakini and Varnini (also called Jaya and Vijaya) become extremely hungry and beg for food. Though Parvati initially promises to give them food once they return home, the merciful goddess beheads <b>herself</b> <b>with</b> her nails and gives her blood to satisfy their hunger.
