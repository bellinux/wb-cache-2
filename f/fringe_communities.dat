40|$|Ghana is {{on track}} for {{implementation}} of a national REDD+ scheme, the incentive based mechanism that seeks to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and also (+) enhances forest carbon stocks through sustainable forest management in developing countries. This study {{is based on a}} review of literature and interviews with key informants. The concepts utilised for this exploratory study were based on issues regarding the implications of land tenure and benefit sharing for forest <b>fringe</b> <b>communities</b> under the REDD+ scheme. The findings of the research indicate that Ghana’s current statutory provision do not generally recognise the rights of forest <b>fringe</b> <b>communities</b> in the management of forest resources. However, under the REDD+ scheme preparatory process, Ghana has engaged forest <b>fringe</b> <b>communities</b> as key stakeholders for the scheme in general and for specific components such as the development of a benefit sharing framework for the scheme. This paper suggests that the participatory approach adopted in the REDD+ readiness phase of Ghana could build genuine support from forest <b>fringe</b> <b>communities</b> if there is strong political will to initiate reforms in the forestry sector that will legally recognise the rights of forest <b>fringe</b> <b>communities</b> and thereby make these communities shareholders of the scheme. ...|$|E

40|$|Non-timber forest {{products}} (NTFPs) constitute {{the single largest}} determinant of livelihoods for scores of forest <b>fringe</b> <b>communities</b> and poor people in the tropics. In India over 50 million people {{are believed to be}} directly dependent upon NTFPs for their subsistence. However, such human dependence on NTFPs for livelihood gains (win) has most frequently been at a certain ecological cost (lose). If livelihoods are to be maintained, the existing ‘win-lose’ settings have to be steered to a ‘win-win’ mode, otherwise, there could be severe erosion of the biological resources and loss of livelihoods (‘lose-lose’). Examining the dependence of forest <b>fringe</b> <b>communities</b> on NTFPs at three sites in south India with contrasting human and ecological settings, three key factors (extent of dependence on NTFPs, indigenous ecological knowledge and market organization) are likely to constrain reaching the win-win situation. How these factors shape the ecological cost of harvesting NTFPs at the three sites is examined. Within the parameter space of these factors, it is possible to predict outcomes and associations that will conform to win-win or win lose situations. Empirical data derived from the three study sites demonstrate the causality of the observed associations. The key for long-term livelihood gains lies in reducing the ecological cost. Certain interventions and recommendations that could optimize the balance between livelihood gains and ecological cost are proposed...|$|E

Furthermore, it finds that the factors that account for population growth at the rural - urban fringe are not only those associated with suburbanization, but also those associated with nonmetropolitan growth. It also demonstrates that population growth at the rural - urban fringe varies not only by municipal type but also by race.

The theoretical model of common property resources suggests that cooperative behavior of JFM guided by norms of restraint and customs may be stable against invasion by narrowly self-interested behaviour. The study also indicates that without costly sanctions against poor JFM-households for extracting illegal forest products, JFM appears to be beneficial for all. ...|$|R

30|$|A {{decrease}} {{in the area of}} broadleaved forests which includes species such as Terminalia belerica, T. chebula, Dalbergia sissoo, Pyrus pashia, Albizzia chinensis, Juglans regia and Celtis australis, has also been observed in the present study, primarily due to the anthropogenic pressure of the forest <b>fringe</b> <b>communities.</b> According to Baland et al., 2008, broad-leaved forests tend to be more useful and consequently more degraded than coniferous forests. The former are of greater utility to adjacent villages due to the superior quality of firewood and fodder, and are also a source of several non-timber forest products. The {{decrease in}} the area under bamboo forests may be attributed to pressure on bamboo for its commercial purposes. In Himachal Pradesh, bamboo forests are considered economically very important and support local livelihoods. Several villagers generate income from them by making use of bamboo in basket making (Gouri et al. 2004).|$|E
