25|$|The {{project began}} with the {{building}} of giant underground vaults upon which the temple would be built {{so it could be}} larger than the small flat area on top of Mount Moriah. Ground level at the time was at least 20ft. (6m) below the current level, as can be seen by walking the Western Wall tunnels. Legend has it that the construction of the entire complex lasted only three years, but other sources such as Josephus say that it took far longer, although the Temple itself may <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>that</b> long. During a Passover visit by Jesus the Jews replied that it had been under construction for 46 years. It is possible that the complex was only a few years completed when the future Emperor Titus destroyed the Temple in 70 CE.|$|E
25|$|The Dublin Council advised Essex {{to attack}} O'Neill's confederates in the east, around the Pale, where the rebels were {{reckoned}} at 3,000 plus 800 mercenaries sent from Ulster. Essex seems to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>that</b> advice, ordering 5,000 troops into garrisons {{along the border}} of the Pale. To counter the White Knight he reinforced Cork on the south coast, and more troops were ordered into Munster for Sir Thomas Norris (acting president of that province) and into Kilkenny for the Earl of Ormond. In the west the army of the President of Connacht, Sir Conyers Clifford, was increased to 3,000. Conditions on the ground had set Essex in opposition to the Council in London: he put the threat from the north on hold and chose, instead, to head south and subdue Ireland in a roundabout tour - through the Pale into Munster, and heading back to Dublin through south Leinster.|$|E
25|$|This {{method has}} two major disadvantages. First, {{planetary}} transits are observable {{only when the}} planet's orbit happens to be perfectly aligned from the astronomers' vantage point. The probability of a planetary orbital plane being directly on the line-of-sight to a star is {{the ratio of the}} diameter of the star to the diameter of the orbit (in small stars, the radius of the planet is also an important factor). About 10% of planets with small orbits have such an alignment, and the fraction decreases for planets with larger orbits. For a planet orbiting a Sun-sized star at 1 AU, the probability of a random alignment producing a transit is 0.47%. Therefore, the method cannot guarantee that any particular star is not a host to planets. However, by scanning large areas of the sky containing thousands or even hundreds of thousands of stars at once, transit surveys can find more extrasolar planets than the radial-velocity method. Several surveys <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>that</b> approach, such as the ground-based MEarth Project, SuperWASP, KELT, and HATNet and the space-based COROT and Kepler missions. The transit method has also the advantage of detecting planets around stars that are located a few thousand light years away. The most distant planets detected by Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search are located near the galactic center. However, reliable follow-up observations of these stars are nearly impossible with current technology.|$|E

All her disloyalties had been unintentional, indeed almost instinctive, {{breaches}} of her subordination to this aim which was his alone. These breaches he realized had been the reality of her nature fighting against her profoundest resolutions.|$|R
500|$|In the {{concluding}} statements, one prosecuting attorney {{said that what}} Till did was wrong, but that his action warranted a spanking, not murder. Gerald Chatham passionately called for justice and mocked the sheriff and doctor's statements that alluded to a conspiracy. Mamie Bradley indicated she was very impressed with his summation. The defense stated that the prosecution's theory of the events the night Till was murdered were improbable, and said the jury's [...] "forefathers would turn over in their graves" [...] if they convicted Bryant and Milam. Only three outcomes were possible in Mississippi for capital murder: life imprisonment, the death penalty, or acquittal. On September 23 the all-white, all-male jury (both women and blacks had been banned) acquitted both defendants after a 67-minute deliberation; one juror said, [...] "If we hadn't stopped to drink pop, it wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>that</b> long." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 10, Bell {{was stopped}} in Olla, Louisiana, for {{speeding}} {{and not having}} proper vehicle insurance while on a weekend pass from his sentence. Bell {{was not supposed to}} leave Monroe, Louisiana, during the pass. The vehicle was towed {{due to the lack of}} insurance. In an interview televised on CNN on August 24, 2008, Bell admitted to having struck Barker in 2006 and described Jena as [...] "a real racist town". On August 27, 2008, the Louisiana High School Athletic Association turned down Bell's request for an extra year of athletic eligibility. Marcus Jones, Bell's father, blamed Bell's attorney at the time of the plea agreement for the denial. [...] "If it weren't for his attorney, Mychal would be able to play football", Jones said. [...] "They coerced him into taking that plea agreement. If he wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>that</b> plea, he wouldn't be in the position he's in now." [...] In 2014, Bell was attending Southern University in Baton Rouge.|$|E

2500|$|The duo had not {{expected}} to star in a film at this point of their careers, with Mitchell stating that [...] "it probably came much earlier than {{we thought we would}} do a film. [...] It landed very fortuitously on our doormat." [...] At first, Mitchell and Webb were not considered for the roles of Harry and Karl, but O'Connor changed his mind [...] "it became clear they could do these parts really well. [...] And we thought, well, wouldn't it be great to do our first movie with people we know, because we really admire and enjoy working with them". Unlike most other Mitchell and Webb projects, Olivia Colman does not have a main part in the film. O'Connor explained that [...] "Olivia was part of the development and did some read-throughs with us. [...] I guess our feeling was that because of the relationship between [...] and Olivia in Peep Show, to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>that</b> same relationship, {{it would have been a}} really weird thing for the audience. [...] I must say I think she'd have been great in the part, she was great in the read-throughs, I just thought we couldn't have done that." [...] Mitchell admitted, the day before the film's release, that he [...] "really got into" [...] his role as Harry.|$|E
2500|$|Responding to such criticism, Wolf said, [...] "All {{the people}} who are attacking me right now for 'conspiracy theories' have no idea what they are talking about ... people who assume the {{dominant}} narrative MUST BE TRUE and the dominant reasons MUST BE REAL are not experienced in how that world works." [...] To her nearly 100,000 Facebook followers, Wolf maintained, [...] "I stand by what I wrote." [...] However, in a follow-up Facebook post two days later, Wolf retracted her statement: [...] "I am not asserting that the ISIS videos have been staged," [...] she wrote. [...] "I certainly sincerely apologize if one of my posts was insensitively worded. I <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>that</b> one down. ... I am not saying the ISIS beheading videos are not authentic. I am not saying they are not records of terrible atrocities. I am saying that they are not yet independently confirmed by two sources as authentic, which any Journalism School teaches, and the single source for several of them, SITE, which received half a million dollars in government funding in 2004, and which is the only source cited for several, has conflicts of interest that should be disclosed to readers of news outlets." [...] Wolf did not say how it was possible to independently verify the videos posted by SITE.|$|E
