5|$|<b>Hexagonal</b> and zincblende polymorphs have no {{inversion}} symmetry (reflection of {{a crystal}} relative to any given point does not {{transform it into}} itself). This and other lattice symmetry properties result in piezoelectricity of the <b>hexagonal</b> and zincblende ZnO, and pyroelectricity of <b>hexagonal</b> ZnO.|$|E
5|$|Crystal fibres, formed of <b>hexagonal</b> {{arrays of}} hollow nanofibres, create the bright {{iridescent}} colours of the bristles of Aphrodita, the sea mouse, a non-wormlike genus of marine annelids. The colours are aposematic, warning predators not to attack. The chitin {{walls of the}} hollow bristles form a <b>hexagonal</b> honeycomb-shaped photonic crystal; the <b>hexagonal</b> holes are 0.51 μm apart. The structure behaves optically as if it consisted of a stack of 88 diffraction gratings, making Aphrodita {{one of the most}} iridescent of marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|Crystals of {{vanadinite}} {{conform to}} a <b>hexagonal</b> system of symmetry. This internal structure is often {{reflected in the}} <b>hexagonal</b> external shape of the crystals. The crystals are usually {{in the form of}} short <b>hexagonal</b> prisms, but can also be found as <b>hexagonal</b> pyramids, rounded masses or crusts. A unit cell of vanadinite, the smallest divisible unit that possesses the same symmetry and properties, {{is in the form of}} a <b>hexagonal</b> prism. The unit cell of vanadinite is composed of two of its molecules and has the dimensions a = 10.331Å and c = 7.343Å), where a is the length of each side of the hexagon and c is the height of the prism. The volume of each unit cell of vanadinite, given by the formula V = a2c sin(60°), is 678.72Å3.|$|E
5|$|Crystals, though long {{admired for}} their {{regularity}} and symmetry, were not investigated scientifically until the 17th century. Johannes Kepler hypothesized {{in his work}} Strena seu de Nive Sexangula (A New Year's Gift of <b>Hexagonal</b> Snow) (1611) that the <b>hexagonal</b> symmetry of snowflake crystals was due to a regular packing of spherical water particles.|$|E
5|$|It is a white, <b>hexagonal</b> shaped {{6 metres}} (20ft) tall pagoda. The first storey of the pagoda has a <b>hexagonal</b> chamber, {{while the second}} storey is purely decorative. The pagoda is {{decorated}} with lotus petals and the steeple supports a precious bottle {{in the shape of}} a flower.|$|E
5|$|As a New Year's {{gift that}} year (1611), he also {{composed}} {{for his friend}} and some-time patron, Baron Wackher von Wackhenfels, a short pamphlet entitled Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula (A New Year's Gift of <b>Hexagonal</b> Snow). In this treatise, he published the first description of the <b>hexagonal</b> symmetry of snowflakes and, extending the discussion into a hypothetical atomistic physical basis for the symmetry, posed what later {{became known as the}} Kepler conjecture, a statement about the most efficient arrangement for packing spheres.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the lighter}} {{actinides}} californium, berkelium, curium and americium which crystallize {{in a double}} <b>hexagonal</b> structure at ambient conditions, einsteinium {{is believed to have}} a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry with the space group Fmm and the lattice constant a = 575 pm. However, there is a report of room-temperature <b>hexagonal</b> einsteinium metal with a = 398 pm and c = 650 pm, which converted to the fcc phase upon heating to 300°C.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium(III) oxide (Es2O3) was {{obtained}} by burning einsteinium(III) nitrate. It forms colorless cubic crystals, which were first characterized from microgram samples sized about 30 nanometers. Two other phases, monoclinic and <b>hexagonal,</b> are known for this oxide. The formation of a certain Es2O3 phase depends on the preparation technique and sample history, {{and there is no}} clear phase diagram. Interconversions between the three phases can occur spontaneously, as a result of self-irradiation or self-heating. The <b>hexagonal</b> phase is isotypic with lanthanum(III) oxide where the Es3+ ion is surrounded by a 6-coordinated group of O2− ions.|$|E
5|$|In air or oxygen: B2O3 {{protective}} layer prevents further oxidation to ~1300°C; no conversion to <b>hexagonal</b> form at 1400°C.|$|E
5|$|The dhcp (double <b>hexagonal</b> close-packed) form of β-cerium is the {{equilibrium}} structure approximately from room temperature to −150°C.|$|E
5|$|The {{honeycomb}} {{provides a}} well-known example of tessellation in nature with its <b>hexagonal</b> cells.|$|E

5|$|A <b>hexagonal</b> {{mortuary}} {{is located}} {{on the left side of}} the façade. It was built by Father Bon between 1867 and 1868. Inside is a baroque retablo, similar to the altars inside the church. It is now used as an adoration chapel.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium(III) iodide forms <b>hexagonal</b> {{crystals}} {{with the}} lattice constants a = 758.4 pm and c = 2087 pm. The known oxyhalides of berkelium include BkOCl, BkOBr and BkOI; they all crystallize in a tetragonal lattice.|$|E
5|$|Copper(I) {{chloride}} has the cubic zincblende {{crystal structure}} at ambient conditions. Upon heating to 408°C the structure changes to <b>hexagonal.</b> Several other crystalline forms of CuCl appear at high pressures (several GPa).|$|E
5|$|Disk-shaped LC {{molecules}} can orient {{themselves in}} a layer-like fashion known as the discotic nematic phase. If the disks pack into stacks, the phase is called a discotic columnar. The columns themselves may be organized into rectangular or <b>hexagonal</b> arrays. Chiral discotic phases, similar to the chiral nematic phase, are also known.|$|E
5|$|Every line stays {{unchanged}} by the curve-shortening flow. Lines are {{the only}} curves that are unaffected by the curve-shortening flow, although there exist more complex stable networks of curves, such as the <b>hexagonal</b> tiling of the plane.|$|E
5|$|For example, rhenium diboride can be {{produced}} at ambient pressures, but is rather expensive because of rhenium. The hardness of ReB2 exhibits considerable anisotropy because of its <b>hexagonal</b> layered structure. Its value is {{comparable to that of}} tungsten carbide, silicon carbide, titanium diboride or zirconium diboride.|$|E
5|$|For some systems, at high concentrations, inverse phases are observed. That is, one may {{generate}} an inverse <b>hexagonal</b> columnar phase (columns of water encapsulated by amphiphiles) or an inverse micellar phase (a bulk liquid crystal sample with spherical water cavities).|$|E
5|$|<b>Hexagonal</b> {{boron nitride}} forms atomically thin layers, {{which have been}} used to enhance the {{electron}} mobility in graphene devices. It also forms nanotubular structures (BNNTs), which have with high strength, high chemical stability, and high thermal conductivity, among its list of desirable properties.|$|E

5|$|In 1619 Johannes Kepler made {{an early}} {{documented}} study of tessellations. He wrote about regular and semiregular tessellations in his Harmonices Mundi; he was possibly {{the first to}} explore and to explain the <b>hexagonal</b> structures of honeycomb and snowflakes.|$|E
5|$|In {{creating}} Selina Kyle's catsuit, {{two layers}} of material were used, with the outer layer being polyurethane coated spandex, embossed with a <b>hexagonal</b> pattern. The catsuit also consisted of elbow-length gloves, a utility belt, and thigh-high boots with spike heels.|$|E
5|$|Krypton is {{characterized}} by several sharp emission lines (spectral signatures) the strongest being green and yellow. Krypton {{is one of the}} products of uranium fission. Solid krypton is white and has a face-centered cubic crystal structure, which is a common property of all noble gases (except helium, which has a <b>hexagonal</b> close-packed crystal structure).|$|E
5|$|Promethium has {{a double}} <b>hexagonal</b> close packed (dhcp) {{structure}} and a hardness of 63kg/mm2. This low-temperature alpha form converts into a beta, body-centered cubic (bcc) phase upon heating to 890°C.|$|E
5|$|Similar to graphite, various molecules, such as NH3 or alkali metals, can be {{intercalated}} into <b>hexagonal</b> boron nitride, that {{is inserted}} between its layers. Both experiment and theory suggest the intercalation {{is much more}} difficult for BN than for graphite.|$|E
5|$|Snowflakes {{nucleate}} around mineral or organic {{particles in}} moisture-saturated, subfreezing air masses. They grow by net accretion to the incipient crystals in <b>hexagonal</b> formations. The cohesive forces are primarily electrostatic.|$|E
5|$|The {{content of}} water or other solvent {{molecules}} changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into micelles or vesicles. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a <b>hexagonal</b> columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly <b>hexagonal</b> lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the <b>hexagonal</b> and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.|$|E
5|$|The cup {{came to the}} British Museum with a {{custom-made}} <b>hexagonal</b> case {{of leather}} on a wood frame, with iron lock, handles and mounts. This was either made {{at the same time}} or soon after the cup, and has incised and stamped foliate decoration and a blackletter inscription: YHE.SUS.O.MARYA.O.MARYA YHE SUS.|$|E
5|$|The ternary berkelium(IV) {{chloride}} Cs2BkCl6 {{is obtained}} by dissolving berkelium(IV) hydroxide in a chilled solution of caesium chloride in concentrated hydrochloric acid. It forms orange <b>hexagonal</b> crystals with the lattice constants a = 745.1 pm and c = 1209.7 pm. The average {{radius of the}} BkCl62− ion in this compound is estimated as 270 pm.|$|E
5|$|Three of {{the most}} {{commonly}} used crystal lattice structures in metals are the body-centred cubic, face-centred cubic and close-packed <b>hexagonal.</b> Ferritic steel has a body-centred cubic structure and austenitic steel, non-ferrous metals like aluminum, copper and nickel have the face-centred cubic structure.|$|E
5|$|Alpha {{silicon carbide}} (α-SiC) {{is the most}} {{commonly}} encountered polymorph; it is formed at temperatures greater than 1700°C and has a <b>hexagonal</b> crystal structure (similar to Wurtzite). The beta modification (β-SiC), with a zinc blende crystal structure (similar to diamond), is formed at temperatures below 1700°C. Until recently, the beta form has had relatively few commercial uses, although there is now increasing interest in its use as a support for heterogeneous catalysts, owing to its higher surface area compared to the alpha form.|$|E
5|$|Bloody Fun Day is {{a puzzle}} Flash game {{developed}} by Urban Squall {{and published by}} Kongregate on March 12, 2009. Players control one {{of a family of}} three grim reapers and are tasked with moving around an island of <b>hexagonal</b> tiles, killing creatures called Cuties in order to replenish their own life force. Cuties come in four colors. Only the red ones restore life; the others charge special abilities that give the player more ways to kill further Cuties.|$|E
5|$|Boron carbide and cubic {{boron nitride}} powders {{are widely used}} as abrasives. Boron nitride is a {{material}} isoelectronic to carbon. Similar to carbon, it has both <b>hexagonal</b> (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, diamond-like c-BN) forms. h-BN {{is used as a}} high temperature component and lubricant. c-BN, also known under commercial name borazon, is a superior abrasive. Its hardness is only slightly smaller than, but its chemical stability is superior, to that of diamond. Heterodiamond (also called BCN) is another diamond-like boron compound.|$|E
