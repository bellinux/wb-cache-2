They may also show difficulty in segmenting words into individual sounds or may blend sounds when producing words, indicating reduced phonemic awareness. Difficulties with word retrieval or naming things is also associated with dyslexia. People with dyslexia are commonly poor spellers, a feature sometimes called <b>dysorthographia</b> or dysgraphia, which depends on orthographic coding.|$|E

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia has a neurodevelopmental {{component}} to its origin, and may share overlapping pathogenic mechanisms with childhood neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs). Nevertheless, longitudinal studies of psychotic outcomes among individuals with NDs are limited. We report a population-based prospective study of six common childhood NDs, subsequent neurocognitive {{performance and the}} risk of psychotic experiences (PEs) in early adolescence. METHOD: PEs were assessed by semi-structured interviews at age 13 years. IQ and working memory were measured between ages 9 and 11 years. The presence of six NDs (autism spectrum, dyslexia, dyspraxia, dysgraphia, <b>dysorthographia,</b> dyscalculia) was determined from parent-completed questionnaires at age 9 years. Linear regression calculated the mean difference in cognitive scores between children with and without NDs. Associations between NDs and PEs were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95...|$|E
40|$|Writing {{does not}} consist merely in spelling, but also {{includes}} a textual dimension that requires several years of learning. And yet, in speech and language therapy, children are generally reported, {{in the field of}} written production, only because of their difficulties with spelling. What of their ability to produce a written text, then? This issue underlies an exploratory research lead with children, who are in their third and fourth year of primary school, with or without <b>dysorthographia.</b> These were placed in several writing situations (spelling tests and text writing). Some results concerning the writing of a story on the basis of given pictures are presented. They show that there are both divergences (length of the texts, reconstruction of the content and use of some linguistic units) and convergences (types of texts produced, use of verb tenses) between the two types of children...|$|E
40|$|The {{syndrome}} {{known as}} Learning Disabilities (LD) {{was described by}} S. Kirk in 1963. From that point on, institutions from the US, Canada and Spain have engaged in refining the concept and classification of LDs. The Complutense University in Spain, has proposed a descriptive and all-embracing definition, and has studied the different manifestations of LD, pursuing the description of biological markers and neurological features of LD’s main expressions: dyslexia, dyscalculia, <b>dysorthographia,</b> Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder –ADHD, and so forth. Findings in LD using functional neuroimaging techniques, namely Magnetoencephalography (MEG), are described. MEG is a non-invasive technique, which records magnetic fields naturally generated by the brain and their spatial distribution. It allows simultaneous functional and structural information. MEG is therefore {{used in the study}} of primary and superior cognitive functions, in surveillance of patterns of normal cognitive function and those specific to the different LD clinical manifestations...|$|E

ABSTRACT: The {{aim of this}} disseration work is to map the {{frequency}} of specific logopedic findings in children with specific learning and behavioral disorders. The first five chapters are theorethical and describe the specific logopedic findings in details. The author herein defines the terms "speach", "language", "communication and developmental disorders of communication"; moreover she also analyses the one specific speach disorder frequently mentioned in literature in conjunction with specific learning disorders, and also precisely describes each specific logopedic finding. The last chapter characterizes specific learning and behavioral disorderds, focusing especially on dyslexia and <b>dysorthographia</b> - both frequently associated with specific logopedic findings. The practical part consists of pre-research and research by itself. The two main and four partial aims have been established, which all have been verified by three methods: the test of speach sense, 6 subtests of Heidelberg test of speach development and by rough examination of specific assimilations and articulation imperfections.

40|$|When {{teacher of}} spanish {{language}} meets in {{his professional life}} some students with problem called specific learning disabilities, it`s important {{for him to be}} informed about their difficulties with learning foreign language. For these students is characteristic the deficit in their visual and auditive perception. They need tailor-made approach of the teacher. Among the specific learning disabilities, which complicates learning of foreign language, are counted foremost dyslexia, dysgraphia and <b>dysorthographia.</b> These students often have also certain psychical problems and problems with behaviour. The intelligence of these students is equal or higher than average. While learning spanish, difficulties of sutdents with specific learning diabilities are manifesting in various fields of language. The most difficult things are these, which are different from the mother language. However these students have also problems with relatively easz things. The greatest difficulties is caused by the velocity of spanish. Because of it the students have problems with uderstanding, because of the deficit of the fonematic hearing they hardly recognize for example boundaries of words. There are various compensatory aids for sutdents with specific learning disabilities. The multisensorial computer program Jazyky bez bariér [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the topic of {{teaching}} French to children affected by learning disorders. It aims to describe various principles and their application into practice at beginners classes. The theoretical part investigates learning disorders as a whole with their causes, manifestations, diagnose and reeducational techniques and activities that are applied in practice. The {{last part of the}} thesis is dedicated to foreign language teaching in the context of learning disorders, fundamental principles and methods of partial linguistic spheres. Further on, the practical part presents a case study of two children with learning disorders during a French class. Individual activities are introduced that are appropriate for their teaching. Finally, two applications suitable for both class at school and home preparation are designed, with their main contribution being the immediate feedback that allows children to work alone. Regarding the rather practical character of the diploma thesis, a great number of examples illustrating various learning disorders are introduced in order for the reader to understand the difficulties that affected children encounter.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{thoroughly}} examine and analyse {{the success of the}} transcription of Šali's group test dictation {{on the basis of the}} phonological analysis. The dictation serves as a screening test for identifying children with speech and language difficulties who are at risk in the areas of reading and writing. The children in this group used to be or were being treated for speech and language difficulties at the time of the screening test. Speech and language difficulties involve phonetic, phonological and language disorders (morphological, lexical and syntactical), which can lead to reading and writing difficulties (dyslexia, dysortographia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia). This topic was chosen because writing issues are increasingly frequent. It seemed sensible to explore it further considering the fact that this diagnostic tool for discovering reading and writing difficulties is being used systematically in the coastal area of Slovenia. The test is conducted in every third grade of primary school as a screening test. The theoretical part of the thesis provides a detailed description of writing skills and accompanying processes. It also discusses the disabilities that may arise due to such deficiencies (<b>dysorthographia</b> and different types of dysgraphia). The research should help identify the most common writing-related issues in children struggling with speech and language difficulties. As a result, it would contribute to more successful and effective speech-language analysis and treatment. Moreover, a detailed analysis of errors would be useful for other professionals as well, including speech-language pathologists treating children with writing issues. We expect that the research results will help us give helpful advice to teachers and parents and raise awareness about the reasons for poor dictation results. ...|$|E
40|$|For {{the last}} decade {{literacy}} and illiteracy of the young {{at the end of}} their education has been very often the subject under discussion. Already in 1951 UNESCO provided the definition of literacy, which says that literacy is the ability of a person who can with understanding both read and write a short, simple statement of his everyday life. The definition was later on expanded to the possession by an individual of the knowledge and skills of reading and writing, which enable him to effectively engage in all those activities which comprise literacy. When talking about literacy pupils with deficits in individual fields of learning, among them also pupils with reading and writing disorder are a risk group in particular. Authors claim that learning difficulties have a significant impact on educational performance of an individual, and pupils with learning and specific learning difficulties achieve a lower level of literacy in the fields of reading, mathematical and scientific literacy. These pupils’ characteristics, such as problems in phonological processing, working memory, weak organisational skills and other executive functions, have an important influence on the process of literacy and literacy itself. The theoretical part of the thesis provides an overview of various definitions of literacy, different types of literacy, the definition of inclusive upbringing and education, the definition of specific learning difficulties and deficits in individual learning fields, particular types of reading and writing deficits (dyslexia, the deficit in reading comprehension, dysgraphia, <b>dysorthographia),</b> and some connections between literacy and reading and writing disorder. The empirical part represents the results of the research on literacy, which was carried out among eighth- and ninth graders by comparing the group with reading and writing disorder with their peers without any disorder. The data for the research were gained with the test, which measures three types of literacy at three levels. The first part of the test refers to general information about the pupils tested (age, gender, grade). The second part of the test is designed to check literacy, and includes three thematic sets or types of literacy – textual, document and calculation literacy. The main purpose of the research was to find out what is the level of literacy of pupils with reading and writing disorder in comparison with their peers. It was found out that in general there is a difference in literacy between pupils with reading and writing disorder and pupils without any disorder, and that literacy is lower among pupils with reading and writing disorder. Within general literacy all three types of literacy were examined; the results showed a difference between the two groups, however they were in favour of the group without reading and writing disorder. Pupils with reading and writing disorder reach the lowest level in calculation literacy, where the arithmetic mean of points is 2. 94. The calculation literacy is also the lowest among pupils without reading and writing disorder, their arithmetic mean is 3. 92. The highest level is reached in document literacy, where the arithmetic mean is 4. 89 among pupils with reading and writing disorder, and 5. 56 among pupils without reading and writing disorder. The research showed that the gender has no impact on the outcome of literacy both in general and in an individual group. ...|$|E
