After a first analysis of the global electronic waste management scenario, three scenarios were selected: (1) optimistic scenario, in which the tablet is recycled considering the best available technologies; (2) a conservative scenario, which considers only the best referenced recycling channels; (3) a pessimist scenario considering the worst situation in terms <b>of</b> <b>recycling.</b> For some impact categories, the recycling activities result in higher environmental impacts than the scenarios with poor recycling, among others due to the increase in energy consumption during recycling.

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the {{economic}} impact <b>of</b> textile <b>recycling</b> including the overconsumption and resulting recycling processes that occur globally. A micro-macro systems model, including the myriad constituents of the industry, is presented that depicts the global textiles recycling processes, particularly {{as it pertains to}} apparel waste rather than manufacturing waste. As environmental concerns continue to rise, consumers must shift their attitude toward the use of recycled goods in the marketplace. Citizens should lobby their municipalities to add textiles to their recycling options. When we consider the complexity <b>of</b> the textile <b>recycling</b> system and the <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> cooperation among the players, we then understand both the environmental and economic <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> textile <b>recycling.</b> To recycle successfully, everyone must embrace the system and not just make an occasional charitable donation.

40|$|SummaryPrebiotic {{chemical}} reactions {{would have been}} greatly aided by a process whereby living materials could have been recycled under conditions of limiting resources. Recombination of RNA fragments is a viable means <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> but has not been demonstrated. Using systems based on the Azoarcus group I intron ribozyme, computational Monte Carlo studies indicate that a moderate level <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> activity, spontaneous or catalyzed, leads to the most robust selection scenarios. It is interesting that recycling leads to a threshold effect where a dominant species suddenly jumps to fixation. In conjunction, laboratory studies with the Azoarcus ribozyme corroborate these results, showing that mixtures of scrambled and/or deleteriously mutated molecules can recycle their component fragments to generate fully functional recombinase ribozymes. These studies highlight the <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> recombination and <b>recycling</b> jointly in the advent of living systems...|$|R

We identify a transplantable recycling sequence that is both necessary and sufficient for efficient receptor <b>recycling.</b> Furthermore, removal <b>of</b> this C-terminal <b>recycling</b> sequence alters the endocytic fate of FPR 2 /ALX and evokes pro-apoptotic effects in response to agonist activation.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundRecent {{work has}} {{highlighted}} the <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> endocytic membranes to the intercellular bridge for completion of cytokinesis in animal cells. ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF 6), which localizes to the plasma membrane and endosomal compartments, regulates endocytic recycling {{to the bridge}} during cytokinesis and is required for abscission. ResultsHere, we report that the JNK-interacting proteins JIP 3 and JIP 4, two highly related scaffolding proteins for JNK signaling modules, also acting as binding partners of kinesin- 1 and dynactin complex, can function as downstream effectors of ARF 6. In vitro, binding of GTP-ARF 6 to the second leucine zipper domain of JIP 3 and JIP 4 interferes with JIPs' association with kinesin- 1, whereas it favors JIPs' interaction with the dynactin complex. With protein silencing by small interfering RNA and dominant inhibition approaches, we show that ARF 6, JIP 4, kinesin- 1, and the dynactin complex control the trafficking <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> endosomes {{in and out of}} the intercellular bridge and are necessary for abscission. ConclusionOur findings reveal a novel function for ARF 6 as a regulatory switch for motor proteins of opposing direction that controls trafficking of endocytic vesicles within the intercellular bridge in a mechanism required for abscission...|$|R

One such example is Gameday Recycling, which was started in 2009 and has exponentially increased in tonnage recycled. This project involves over 80,000 people on any given home weekend, a way for Clemson University {{to educate the public}} about the Solid Green campaign. Trash bags are placed at each parking spot and volunteers go around after the games collecting the trash and taking it to the recycling center. Recycling bins are placed in each dorm room with recycling containers at the base of each dormitory. Offices and classrooms on campus have completely replaced regular waste bins with recycling bins. There is also a massive recycling center at Kite Hill, which is open to anyone. Clemson students compete in RecycleMania each year, a nationwide event in which college campuses compete to recycle the most waste. At Cherry Crossing Research Facility, the community can drop off unused food for compost, or yard waste to be recycled as mulch, an extra effort by the university to decrease their carbon footprint. University faculty and staff are strongly encouraged {{to take advantage of the}} opportunities around campus to recycle and to educate their students about the importance of conserving our valuable resources.

The PGMs’ high economic value and difficult to replace technological properties, together with their scarcity in the Earth’s crust, justify concerns about their critical condition and reinforce the <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> developing <b>recycling</b> practices for PGM end-of-life materials. This article presents and discusses recent advances regarding the use of hydrometallurgical solvent extraction to recover one PGM, palladium, from spent catalysts. Two different tendencies are implicit in the literature concerning Pd(II) extraction: a few groups focus on the adjustment and optimization of current commercial extractants, while others prefer to design new extracting compounds. Actually, the leach solutions obtained from the treatment of anthropogenic materials generally exhibit different compositions when compared to those coming from the primary resources.
