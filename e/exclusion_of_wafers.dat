40|$|Chemical {{mechanical}} polishing (CMP) {{has emerged as}} a critical technique for the manufacture of complex integrated circuits to achieve low surface roughness and high degree of planarization. In particular, the continuous progression <b>of</b> the <b>wafer</b> carrier has been driven by the interest of diminishing the waste on a wafer by reducing the edge <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> area, and hence, increasing the amount <b>of</b> chips per <b>wafer.</b> In this thesis,a standard wafer carrier and {{the state of the art}} Titan™ wafer carrierare compared and evaluated by planarizing a set <b>of</b> blank <b>wafers</b> with a PECVD oxide film on an IPEC 472 CMP tool. The surface roughness was analyzed before and after the planarization step using an atomic force microscope (AFM) and the nonuniformity across the wafer was characterized by ellipsometry. The material removal rate and the reproducibility of the nonuniformity from wafer to wafer was also observed and compared. A second set of experiments with patterned wafers pla-narized with the Titan™ carrier was also performed. The impact of thepattern density in the step height reduction ratio and surface roughness was analyzed with AFM. The results obtained from the blank wafers planarized with the standard wafer carrier showed a nonuniformity average of ±  6. 96 % with a 3 mm edge <b>of</b> <b>exclusion,</b> a <b>wafer</b> to <b>wafer</b> nonuniformity <b>of</b> ±  4 % and a surface roughness of 0. 34 nm. However, the Titan™ carrier delivered a nonuniformity average of ± 2. 17 %, a wafer to <b>wafer</b> nonuniformity <b>of</b> ± 0. 3 % and a surface roughness of 0. 22 nm. The Titan™ carrier outmatched the standard wafer carrier forcing it to shift the edge <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> area to 7 mm to be able to achieve a nonuniformity of ± 2. 90 %. The results for the set <b>of</b> patterned <b>wafers</b> showed a step height reduction ratio (SHRR) average of 98. 35 %. Thesurface roughness for the oxide above the patterned polysilicon structures decreased from 9. 46 nm to 0. 33 nm and the surface roughness on the recessed areas decreased from 3. 70 nm to 0. 7 nm...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to model the deformation and fracture behaviour <b>of</b> <b>wafers</b> used in chocolate confectionery products. Compression and bending tests showed that the mechanical behaviour <b>of</b> the <b>wafer</b> was characteristic <b>of</b> a brittle foam. The wafer sheet was examined with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to determine the wafer dimensions and to observe the internal microstructure. These images showed that the core <b>of</b> the <b>wafer</b> sheet was more porous than the dense skins <b>of</b> the <b>wafer.</b> An analytical model was developed to calculate the modulus <b>of</b> the <b>wafer</b> core and skin sections. A finite element (FE) model using a simple repetitive geometry <b>of</b> the <b>wafer</b> was implemented. The ‘crushable foam’ material model was the closest fit to the wafer deformation under compression and was applied to the core <b>of</b> the <b>wafer.</b> An alternative FE model was proposed, which used the actual complex architecture <b>of</b> the <b>wafer.</b> To attain the wafer architecture, X-ray Microtomography (XMT) was used on a sample to produce a stack of image slices which were reconstructed as a 3 D volume. The microstructure of the 3 D volume was characterised and then meshed with tetrahedral elements for finite element analysis. The cell walls of the model were given a linear elastic material model and a damage criterion to simulate the fracture of the cell walls. In-situ SEM and XMT experiments were conducted which allowed the deformation and fracture <b>of</b> the <b>wafer</b> sheet to be observed simultaneously as the global mechanical response was recorded. The FE model of the complex architecture was able to predict the deformation behaviour <b>of</b> the <b>wafer</b> in compression. In the future, the model can be used to simulate the cutting process <b>of</b> the <b>wafer,</b> allowing the effect of parameters such as cutting speed and blade dimensions to be determined efficiently.

40|$|Silicon wafers are {{commonly}} used materials in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Their geometric quality directly affects the production cost and yield. Therefore, improvement in the quality <b>of</b> <b>wafers</b> is critical for meeting the current competitive market needs. Conventional summary metrics such as total thickness variation, bow and warp can neither fully reflect the local variability within each wafer nor provide useful insight for root cause diagnosis and quality improvement.
