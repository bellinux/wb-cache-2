5|$|The Hunting Party was {{recorded}} at the Larrabee Sound Studios, located in Hollywood, Los Angeles. During the recording for the band's sixth studio album, the band would spend <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>days</b> {{a week at}} the Larrabee Studios working on the record. The Hunting Party was also recorded in part at EastWest Studios, also located in Hollywood. There, drummer Rob Bourdon and Shinoda would record drums and percussion for the album. The band would also record other material for the album at EastWest on occasion.|$|E
5|$|Modern Guilt was {{the final}} release in Beck's {{contract}} with Geffen Records. Beck, then 38, had held the contract since his early 20s. Released from his label contract and going independent, Beck began working more heavily on his own seven-year-old label, which went {{through a variety of}} names. His focus on smaller, more quixotic projects, Beck moonlighted as a producer, working with artists such as Charlotte Gainsbourg, Thurston Moore and Stephen Malkmus. Beck worked for <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>days</b> a week at the small studio on his property in Malibu, and founded Record Club, a project whereby an entire classic album—by The Velvet Underground, Leonard Cohen, INXS, Yanni—would be covered by another singer in the span of a single day. Beck provided four songs for the film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), each attributed to the title character's fictional band, Sex Bob-Omb. Beck also collaborated with Philip Glass, Jack White, Tobacco of Black Moth Super Rainbow, Jamie Lidell, Seu Jorge, Childish Gambino, and The Lonely Island.|$|E

50|$|The French Republican Calendar was {{introduced}} (along with decimal time) in 1793, and {{was similar to}} the ancient Egyptian calendar. It consisted of twelve months, each divided into three décades of ten <b>days,</b> with <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> intercalary <b>days</b> called sansculottides.

25|$|The {{operations}} of the 53d WRS were affected by the federal budget sequestration of 2013. Furloughs of personnel, amounting to two days in every pay period per member, resulted in a 20% cut in capability, according to the wing commander of the 403d Wing on 24 July 2013. While sequestration was in effect, this meant the squadron was capable of working only two storms simultaneously at full mission scheduling instead of the normal three, and that pace sustainable only for <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
25|$|Voelker {{spent much}} of his time fishing near Ishpeming when he was not writing. He kept his car stocked with fishing poles and other supplies, and for seven or eight months of the year, he was out fishing or hiking in the woods. He was said to have fished <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>days</b> a week for 20 years, {{according}} to one close friend. He was also known for his skills as a card player, specifically cribbage. Many readers attempted to locate Frenchman's Pond based on the descriptions from his books. Voelker did many things to discourage them from finding it, including leaving debris in the road to the pond, although he did take some people with him to the pond. Frenchman's Pond is still owned by his daughter Grace and his grandson Adam.|$|E
500|$|The various {{preferences}} regarding ripeness among consumers {{make it hard}} {{to issue}} general statements about choosing a [...] "good" [...] durian. A durian that falls off the tree continues to ripen for two to four days, but after <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>days</b> most would consider it overripe and unpalatable, although some Thais proceed from that point to cook it with palm sugar, creating a dessert called durian (or thurian) guan.|$|E

500|$|In 1963, Edward Lorenz {{discovered}} the chaotic {{nature of the}} fluid dynamics equations involved in weather forecasting. [...] Extremely small errors in temperature, winds, or other initial inputs given to numerical models will amplify and double every five days, {{making it impossible for}} long-range forecasts—those made more than two weeks in advance—to predict the state of the atmosphere with any degree of forecast skill. [...] Furthermore, existing observation networks have poor coverage in some regions (for example, over large bodies of water such as the Pacific Ocean), which introduces uncertainty into the true initial state of the atmosphere. [...] While a set of equations, known as the Liouville equations, exists to determine the initial uncertainty in the model initialization, the equations are too complex to run in real-time, even with the use of supercomputers. [...] These uncertainties limit forecast model accuracy to about <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>days</b> into the future.|$|E
500|$|By May 1718, Teach had awarded {{himself the}} rank of Commodore and was {{at the height of}} his power. Late that month his {{flotilla}} blockaded the port of Charles Town in the Province of South Carolina. All vessels entering or leaving the port were stopped, and as the town had no guard ship, its pilot boat was the first to be captured. Over the next <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>days</b> about nine vessels were stopped and ransacked as they attempted to sail past Charles Town Bar, where Teach's fleet was anchored. One such ship, headed for London with a group of prominent Charles Town citizens which included Samuel Wragg (a member of the Council of the Province of Carolina), was the Crowley. [...] Her passengers were questioned about the vessels still in port and then locked below decks for about half a day. Teach informed the prisoners that his fleet required medical supplies from the colonial government of South Carolina, and that if none were forthcoming, all prisoners would be executed, their heads sent to the Governor and all captured ships burnt.|$|E

25|$|Ethiopia {{has several}} local {{calendar}}s. The most widely known is the Ethiopian calendar, {{also known as}} the Ge'ez calendar. It is based on the older Alexandrian or Coptic calendar, which in turn derives from the Egyptian calendar.

The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar, but their names are in Ge'ez.|$|R
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} by Jackson with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, as well as René Elizondo, Jr.. Its initial stages began following her Janet World Tour, recording intermittently over two years. The process stalled due to various issues facing Jackson, including depression, body dysmorphia, anorexia, and self-hatred. As a result, Jackson spontaneously canceled sessions, appearing constantly troubled, as Jam commented, [...] "That was a tough album to make for her. There were times when she would not {{show up at the}} studio for <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>days</b> in a row".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of his 2006 album The Outsider, Shadow brought his focus less on the {{production}} of new material. However, on March 7, 2009, {{he announced that he}} was working on music for a new album. Though no release date was given, he assured that [...] "it [...] sound different from the last one". Speaking about recording sessions for the album, Shadow stated that [...] "the hardcore work started just after Thanksgiving of 2009." [...] He stated that he worked [...] "at least eight-plus hours a day at least <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>days</b> a week" [...] and that the making of the album took about a year.|$|E
2500|$|One of Symonds' {{biological}} parents was of West Indian {{background and the}} other was believed to be of Danish or Swedish descent. Symonds' adoptive parents Ken and Barbara moved to Australia shortly after his adoption, when he was three months old. [...] Of the adopted siblings, Louise Symonds participated in Gladiators. [...] He also has two non-adopted siblings. He spent the early part of his childhood in Charters Towers, northern Queensland, where his father Ken taught at the private fee paying All Souls St Gabriels School, which Andrew attended. He showed sporting prowess from a very early age. [...] "Dad was cricket mad. He’d throw balls to me <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>days</b> a week, before school, after school. And we’d play all sorts of games inside the house with ping-pong balls and Christmas decorations." [...] Much of his junior cricket was played in Townsville for the Wanderers club, father and son making the 270-kilometre return trip sometimes twice a week. The family later moved to the Gold Coast, where his parents were on the staff of All Saints Anglican School in Merrimac. Symonds was a student at the school.|$|E

2500|$|Using {{personal}} finances, John Devitt founded Vietnam Combat Veterans, Ltd. With {{the help}} of friends, the half-size replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, named The Moving Wall, was built and first put on display {{to the public in}} Tyler, Texas, in 1984. The Moving Wall visits hundreds of small towns and cities throughout the U.S., staying <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>days</b> at each site. Local arrangements for each visit are made months in advance by veterans' organizations and other civic groups. Desire for a hometown visit of The Moving Wall was so high that the waiting list became very long. Vietnam Combat Veterans built a second structure of The Moving Wall. A third structure was added in 1989. In 2001, one of the structures was retired due to wear. By 2006, there had been more than 1,000 hometown visits of The Moving Wall. The count of people who visited The Moving Wall at each display ranges from 5,000 to more than 50,000; the total estimate of visitors is in the tens of millions. As the wall moves from town to town on interstates, it is often escorted by state troopers and up to thousands of local citizens on motorcycles. Many of these are Patriot Guard Riders, who consider escorting The Moving Wall to be a [...] "special mission", which is coordinated on their website. As it passes towns, even when it is not planning a stop in those towns, local veterans organizations sometimes plan for local citizens to gather by the highway and across overpasses to wave flags and salute the Wall.|$|E

50|$|There were twelve months, each {{divided into}} three ten-day weeks called décades. The tenth day, décadi, {{replaced}} Sunday as the day of rest and festivity. The <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> extra <b>days</b> needed to approximate the solar or tropical year were placed after the months {{at the end of}} each year and called complementary days. This arrangement was an almost exact copy of the calendar used by the Ancient Egyptians, though in their case the beginning of the year was marked by summer solstice rather than autumn equinox.|$|R
50|$|The {{attitude}} of the locals changed suddenly, and the base was attacked soon after with small arms. Taliban attacks increased to <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> a <b>day,</b> including fire from RPG-7 anti-tank rocket launchers. With all roads cut, the district centre was effectively under siege, and wholly dependent on helicopter flights from Camp Bastion for resupply. This was sometimes interrupted {{for as long as}} five days, as Taliban fire would have put the helicopters at risk. A unit of Royal Engineers surrounded the whole compound and the helicopter landing pad with a double rampart of Hesco barriers, despite Taliban fire.|$|R
