The term [...] "solvent pot" [...] can also refer to the flask containing the <b>drying</b> <b>agents</b> in a classic solvent still system. Due to fire risks, solvent stills have largely been replaced by solvent columns in which degassed solvent is forced through an insoluble drying agent before being collected.

50|$|The {{drying process}} is {{accelerated}} by certain metal salts, especially derivatives of cobalt, manganese, or iron. In technical terms, these oil <b>drying</b> <b>agents</b> are coordination complexes that function as homogeneous catalysts. These salts {{are derived from}} the carboxylates of lipophilic carboxylic acids, such as naphthenic acids to make the complexes oil-soluble. These catalysts speed up {{the reduction of the}} hydroperoxide intermediates. A series of addition reactions ensues. Each step produces additional free radicals, which then engage in further crosslinking. The process finally terminates when pairs of free radicals combine. The polymerization occurs over a period of days to years and renders the film dry to the touch. Premature action of the <b>drying</b> <b>agents</b> causes skinning of the paint, this undesirable process is suppressed by the addition of antiskinning agents such as methylethyl ketone oxime, which evaporate when the paint/oil is applied to a surface.|$|E

50|$|In {{technical}} literature, oil <b>drying</b> <b>agents,</b> such as naphthenates, {{are described}} as salts, but they are probably also non-ionic coordination complexes with structures similar to basic zinc acetate.These catalysts were traditionally hydrocarbon carboxylate chelates of lead, but due to lead's toxicity, cobalt and other elements, such as zirconium, zinc, calcium, and iron, have replaced the lead in more popular products.
