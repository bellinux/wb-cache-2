An equivalent notation {{could still be}} used by instead defining aggregate matrices as a block-diagonal formation of the component matrices instead of a <b>horizontal</b> <b>concatenation.</b> However, this could potentially require additional memory and computational complexity unless the algorithm can account for the sparseness of the aggregate matrices (i.e., the many matrix entries after block-diagonalization that equal zero), and is not strictly necessary in the first place.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} of Computer music is the availability of easy-to-use software systems {{in order to produce}} sound analysis and synthesis and rarely users are capable to utilize these systems without being expert programmers. In this paper, a visual programming language (VPL) software (Chang 1987, Shu 1986, Burnett and Baker 1994) of sound synthesis and analysis, named WFSound is presented. Such environment is characterized by visual techniques throughout the programming process. The user manipulates icons or other graphical representations to create a program that is subsequently executed in the same visual environment. In particular, the user can operate at different levels of the sound analysis and synthesis processes. The software integrates a structure of scripting, based on the Microsoft VBScript language, which allows the user to create personalized inputs and outputs. These data can be analyzed and many functions can be used. WFSound allows the spatial arrangement of icons in the workspace that constitutes a visual sentence in conventional (textual) programming languages. While in those languages, a program is expressed as a string in which terminal tokens are concatenated to form a sentence and the construction rule is implicit in the language, conversely, in WFSound environment it is possible to arrange icons by <b>horizontal</b> and vertically <b>concatenations.</b> Arrows can link these icons in order to follow the flow of sound signal from the input to the output. The main functions of these icons are the following...|$|R
40|$|John Hughes {{has made}} pretty {{printers}} {{one of the}} prime demonstrations of using combinators to develop a library, and algebra to implement it. This note presents a new design for pretty printers which improves on Hughes's classic design. The new design is based on a single concatenation operator which is associative and has a left and right unit. Hughes's design requires two separate operators for concatenation, where <b>horizontal</b> <b>concatenation</b> has a right unit but no left unit, and vertical concatenation has neither unit...|$|E
40|$|Concatenation is the {{adjoining}} (juxtaposition) of two patterns {{to form a}} larger one. There are two forms of pattern concatenation: horizontal, in which patterns are adjoined at their vertical edges, and horizontal, in which patterns are adjoined at their horizontal edges. We’ll indicate horizontal and vertical concatenation by the symbols and, respectively. In order for concatenation to be possible, {{the adjoining}} edges must be of the same length [1]: for the <b>horizontal</b> <b>concatenation</b> of patterns P and Q, η(P) = η(Q) for the vertical concatenation of patterns P and Q, ω(P) = ω(Q) Figures 1 and 2 show examples of horizontal and vertical concatenation.

30|$|Both {{excitation}} and {{the emission}} spectra were used. For each sample, excitation and emission intensity were independently normalized to 1 (area) {{and then the}} two data blocks were merged (<b>horizontal</b> <b>concatenation</b> of the matrices). For the excitation spectral dataset used in this work it was considered that some filtering was necessary combined with the removal of baseline drifts. It was decided to adopt the Haar transform and 1 st derivative (2 nd order) were selected for this task. Normalization by area (1) is also typically used {{for the analysis of}} fluorescence area and was also considered and applied subsequently to the first two methods [39]. See Additional file 1 for the spectral pre-treatment data.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} Quasi Cyclic Low Density Parity Check code (QC-LDPC) {{is proposed}} {{to reduce the}} complexity of the Low Density Parity Check code (LDPC) while obtaining the similar performance. The proposed QC-LDPC presents an improved construction at high SNR with circulant sub-matrices. The proposed construction yields a performance gain of about 1 dB at a 0. 0003 bit error rate (BER) and it is tested on 4 different decoding algorithms. Proposed QC-LDPC is compared with the existing QC-LDPC and the simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing one at high SNR. Simulations are also performed varying the number of horizontal sub matrices and the results show that the parity check matrix with smaller <b>horizontal</b> <b>concatenation</b> shows better performance...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we mainly define the {{information}} entropy [3], [11] and prove some its basic properties. First, we discuss some properties on four kinds of transformation functions between vector and matrix. The transformation functions are LineVec 2 Mx, ColVec 2 Mx, Vec 2 DiagMx and Mx 2 FinS. Mx 2 FinS is a <b>horizontal</b> <b>concatenation</b> operator for a given matrix, treating rows of the given matrix as finite sequences, yielding a new finite sequence by horizontally joining each row of the given matrix in order to index. Then we define each concept of information entropy for a probability sequence and two kinds of probability matrices, joint and conditional, that are defined in article [25]. Further, we discuss some properties of information entropy including Shannon’s lemma, maximum property, additivity and super-additivity properties...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} innovative algorithms to efficiently compute erosions and dilations of run-length encoded (RLE) binary {{images with}} arbitrary shaped structuring elements. An RLE image {{is given by}} a set of runs, where a run is a <b>horizontal</b> <b>concatenation</b> of foreground pixels. The proposed algorithms extract the skeleton of the structuring element and build distance tables of the input image, which are storing the distance to the next background pixel on the left and right hand sides. This information is then used to speed up the calculations of the erosion and dilation operator by enabling the use of techniques which allow to skip the analysis of certain pixels whenever a hit or miss occurs. Additionally the input image gets trimmed during the preprocessing steps on the base of two primitive criteria. Experimental results show the advantages over other algorithms. The source code of our algorithms is available in C++. Comment: 17 pages, 2 figures. Submitted to Elsevier (Pattern Recognition). For the associated source code, see [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Last class, {{we looked}} at methods for {{approximate}} matrix multiplication, one based on sampling and another based on JL. The problem {{was to find a}} C such that for two matrices A ∈ Rn×d and B ∈ Rn×p: ‖ATB − C ‖ ≤ ‖A‖‖B‖ Where the norms here were Frobenius norms. Then, by analyzing the matrix M that is the <b>horizontal</b> <b>concatenation</b> of A and B, we showed that it is sufficient {{to be able to find}} a C such that: ‖ATA − C ‖ ≤ ‖A‖ 2 Today, we’ll look at operating norms rather than Frobenius norms, and achieve an even stronger bound.

40|$|Abstract. The {{categories}} of representations of compact quantum groups of automorphisms of certain inclusions of finite dimensional C ∗-algebras are {{shown to be}} isomorphic to the {{categories of}} Fuss-Catalan diagrams. A Fuss-Catalan diagram is a planar diagram formed by an upper row of 4 m points, a lower row of 4 n points and by 2 m + 2 n non-crossing strings joining them. Both rows of points are colored {{from left to right}} in the following standard way white, black, black, white, white, black, black, [...] . and the strings have to join pairs of points having the same color. The tensor C ∗-category FC is defined as follows. The objects are the positive integers. The arrows between m and n are the linear combinations of such diagrams. The operations ◦, ⊗ and ∗ are induced by vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>concatenation</b> and upside-down turning of diagrams.
