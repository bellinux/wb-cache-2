I can put more nonsense, more satire and fantasy into the animals...they're also {{easier to do}} than people... With people I try more for realism, which is probably why I'm generally better with animals.|$|E
500|$|Morse {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} supporting roles following the finale of St. Elsewhere in 1988. He is quoted as saying: [...] "I made the decision that I didn't care if there was any money in the role or not. I had to find roles that were <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had been doing." [...] His turn in Desperate Hours as antagonist showed a darker Morse. He later starred in The Indian Runner and The Crossing Guard. He has {{appeared in}} three adaptations of Stephen King stories: The Langoliers, Hearts in Atlantis, and The Green Mile. He was a guest star on , playing the racist cousin of Detective Tim Bayliss.|$|E
500|$|During {{sessions}} for Door, Door at Richmond Recorders in Melbourne in January 1979, the Boys Next Door recorded [...] "Shivers". Engineer Tony Cohen suggested that Howard perform the vocals for the track, arguing that {{his voice was}} best fitted for his own songs. However, the band's regular vocalist, Nick Cave, insisted on singing on the recording. Howard said later {{that as a result}} of Cave's vocals, [...] "Shivers" [...] was [...] "interpreted completely differently and now the song, to most peoples' minds, is something completely <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> intended it to be". In hindsight, Cave noted that Howard's vocals should have been recorded, as Cave was [...] "never able to do that song justice".|$|E

500|$|The {{instrumental}} demos {{were primarily}} written in majorchords, which Byrne considered slightly [...] "ominous" [...] and surprising from Eno. In spite of this, Byrne's lyrics {{ended up being}} hopeful and spiritual, with themes of redemption—what he considers [...] "optimism {{in spite of the}} dread." [...] The tension between optimism and pessimism and the spiritual themes quickly emerged {{over the course of a}} year in which Byrne was writing lyrics, which he has speculated might be an antidote to being [...] "completely pessimistic and cynical about politics and the state of the world;" [...] for instance, [...] "TheRiver" [...] is about the effects of HurricaneKatrina. He has also cited the political climate of the IraqWar, the beginning of the late-2000s recession, the policies of the GeorgeW.Bush administration, and his 2004 divorce from AdelleLutz as factors that inspired him to create uplifting music. As he explained, [...] "I was surprised that's what came out... The tracks are very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would have done myself. I lean toward things that are more complicated." [...] Eno also thinks the album is much better than the songs he imagined when composing them solo.|$|E
500|$|Despite its success, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik {{had some}} detractors, {{including}} hip hop tastemakers who were unaccustomed to the album's style. At the 1995 Source Awards, OutKast {{won in the}} [...] "Best Newcomer" [...] category, but were booed upon taking the stage and delivering their acceptance speech; Big Boi managed to deliver his shout outs, while André 3000 was nervous and only said, [...] "The South got somethin' to say." [...] The latter recalled how the album was received by some listeners, [...] "People thought that the South basically only had bass music. At first people were looking at us like 'Um, I don't know.'" [...] Hip hop magnate Russell Simmons reacted negatively to the album at the time, but later expressed regret and said of the album in retrospect, [...] "At the time, I didn't understand their music—it sounds so <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was used to that I foolishly... claim that they 'weren't hip-hop.' The same way people didn't understand 'Sucker MCs' a decade earlier, I didn't understand that instead of operating outside of hip-hop, OutKast was actually expanding hip-hop. They were offering {{one of the most}} honest expressions, and expression so honest that it went completely over my head at first." ...|$|E

5000|$|When {{asked about}} the album Meyers said, [...] "It's a fun album. It's new. It's <b>different...</b> stylistically <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had been doing before. It's kind of more of a... 80's pop, disco esque, European dance kind of album." ...|$|R

60|$|Here our conference ended. I {{walked out}} of the study a very <b>different</b> being <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was on {{entering}} it. I had gone in with the air of a professor about to deliver a lecture; I came out like a student who had failed in his examination, and been degraded in his class.|$|R
2500|$|Pietersen {{was born}} to an English mother, Penny, and an Afrikaner father, Jannie. Pietersen had a strict and well-disciplined childhood, along with his three {{brothers}} Tony, Greg and Bryan; he learned valuable lessons from this [...] "fantastic" [...] approach to parenting, and said: [...] "Discipline is good. It taught me that I didn't always have to have what I wanted; that what I needed was <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted." [...] Bryan plays club and second XI cricket in England.|$|E
2500|$|As of 28 November 2008, she is {{participating}} in La Féria's newest musical production, Amor Sem Barreiras, the Portuguese adaptation of West Side Story, at Lisbon's Politeama. Anabela {{plays the role}} of Anita, the sensual and confident woman whose boyfriend {{is the leader of the}} Sharks, a gang composed by the first generation of Americans from Puerto Rico. Again, her part is performed in turns with Lúcia Moniz. Talking about her character, Anabela confessed it is her [...] "career's greatest challenge. Completely <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have been doing so far." [...] She further explains that [...] "the attitude, poise and voice are very distinct from mine and clash with the roles of young innocent girl that I am used to performing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You are {{all very}} good, Baron," [...] Desmond said; [...] "but, indeed, I think that Philip was right. I {{can assure you that}} the journey has done me an immense deal of good, and he will tell you that I am very <b>different,</b> now, <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was when he found me at Amiens, for I had begun to think that I should never get away alive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let off? That {{would be}} a very bad thing for me, unless I become a very <b>different</b> man <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have been as yet.

6000|$|... "I {{have never}} heard from priests," [...] said Theodora, [...] "any truth which my {{conscience}} had not revealed to me. They use <b>different</b> language <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> use, but I find, after a time, that we mean the thing. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> call time they call eternity; when they describe heaven, they give a picture of earth; and beings whom they style divine, they invest with all the attributes of humanity." ...|$|R
50|$|Each {{picture is}} a link in a chain, {{and they all}} exist in {{counterpoint}} with the text. And although you want each picture to have impact, just like a jacket, the book illustration can also be much more subtle. It can be pondered and savored {{over a period of}} time. It's a very <b>different</b> discipline <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was used to, but I must say {{it was love at first}} sight.|$|R
60|$|My {{return home}} to Lady Grove was a very <b>different</b> thing <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had {{anticipated}} when I had got out to sea with my load of quap and fancied the Perfect-Filament was safe within my grasp. As I walked through the evening light along the downs, the summer stillness seemed like the stillness of something newly dead. There were no lurking workmen any more, no cyclists on the high road.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{his action}} was so <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had expected, it amazed me. Just now, when I was with him, I learned, I guessed, what stayed his hand. I believe {{you ought to}} know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I know I must {{be pretty}} <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am now before I could sit still forever," [...] said Bill, {{in a lower}} and {{somewhat}} disconcerted tone, as if admitting {{the force of the}} consideration.|$|E

6000|$|... "To say the truth, I {{always had}} {{something}} of a sympathy for that man," [...] said Pheasant. [...] "I can't enjoy goodness and heroism in homoeopathic doses. I want something appreciable. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> can do, being a woman, is a very <b>different</b> thing <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should try to do if I were a man, and had a man's chances: {{it is so much}} less--so poor--that it is scarcely worth trying for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's quite a <b>different</b> man, aunt, <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought; and he's not at {{all like}} old Mr Rubb. Old Mr Rubb, when he comes to drink tea in Gower Street, puts his {{handkerchief}} over his knees to catch the crumbs." ...|$|R
5000|$|In mid-1972 Redfern {{toured the}} US with his mentor, Liberace. He was {{described}} by Australian Women's Weeklys Dita Cobb as [...] "a lovely contrast to the local product of his age. Americans adore him. He is so fresh and funny and unassuming and downright young. Nothing seems to have gone to his head." [...] Redfern remembered his early US performances, [...] "lt was great... I was nervous at first. I got songs in the wrong order and the band was playing <b>different</b> music <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was singing. But it soon straightened out, and I loved the excitement every night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know {{anything}} about that," [...] she replied; [...] "but I used to like to walk about on the sea-shore, for everything was so <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had been accustomed to,--birds, you know, and {{all that sort of}} thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{this your}} witch, Mr. Quatermain?" [...] {{she asked me}} in her vivacious way. [...] "Why, she is <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> expected, quite good-looking and, yes, impressive. I {{am not sure that}} she does not frighten me a little." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't think I understand," [...] said Mr. Touchett with a sigh. [...] "Young men {{are very}} <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was. When I cared for a girl--when I was young--I {{wanted to do}} more than look at her." ...|$|E
60|$|However, {{there was}} not the like {{occasion}} afterward; for I was much more composed in my mind, and resolved for the future to live a quite <b>different</b> life <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had done. As to the wealth I had, I looked upon it as nothing; I resolved to set it apart to any such opportunity of doing justice as God should put into my hand; and the miraculous opportunity I had afterwards of applying some parts of it to preserve a ruined family, whom I had plundered, may be worth reading, if I have room for it in this account.|$|R
60|$|It {{is amazing}} how {{many things in}} this part of the country we'd never have thought of if it hadn't been for Mr. Poplington. At dinner he told us about Exmoor and the Lorna Doone country, and the wild deer hunting that can be had nowhere else in England, and lots of other things that made me feel we must be up and doing if we wanted to see all we ought to see before we left Chedcombe. When I went upstairs I said to Jone that Mr. Poplington was a very <b>different</b> man <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought he was.|$|R
60|$|I took care, when I {{gave him}} the shilling, to let him see that I had a little better {{furniture}} about me than the ordinary prisoners, for he saw that I had a purse, and in it a pretty deal of money; and I found that the very sight of it immediately furnished me with very <b>different</b> treatment <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should otherwise have met with in the ship; for though he was very courteous indeed before, {{in a kind of}} natural compassion to me, as a woman in distress, yet he was more than ordinarily so afterwards, and procured me to be better treated in the ship than, I say, I might otherwise have been; as shall appear in its place.|$|R
