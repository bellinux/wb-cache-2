5|$|They stamp {{their feet}} {{in time to the}} hornpipe – that is until I whip up the {{orchestra}} to a fierce accelerando which leaves behind all those whose stamping technique is not of the very finest quality. I like to win by two bars, if possible; but sometimes have to be content with a bar and a half. It is good fun, and I enjoy <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> they.|$|E
5|$|Gautier was not {{satisfied}} with this story. It was basically a succession of dances with one moment of drama at its end. He had no experience writing ballet scenarios so he called upon Vernoy de St. Georges, {{a man who had}} written many ballet librettos. St. Georges liked Gautier's basic idea of the frail young girl and the Wilis. He wrote the story of Giselle as it is known today in three days, and sent it to Léon Pillet, the director of the Paris Opéra. Pillet needed a good story to introduce Grisi to the Paris public. He found that story in Giselle. Grisi liked <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> Pillet did, so Giselle was put into production at once.|$|E
5|$|Harding's {{attitude}} toward business was {{that government should}} aid <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible. He was suspicious of organized labor, viewing it as a conspiracy against business. He sought {{to get them to}} work together at a conference on unemployment that he called to meet in September 1921 at Hoover's recommendation. Harding warned in his opening address that no federal money would be available. No important legislation came as a result, though some public works projects were accelerated.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't you think, Hargate," [...] Ruthven {{shouted in}} his ear, [...] "we had better run before <b>it?</b> <b>It's</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> Handcock {{can do to}} keep her head straight." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself. She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E
5|$|She often {{bears the}} brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and {{in part due to}} her aloof nature. One such {{occasion}} saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn £500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.|$|E
5|$|The project's {{finalization}} {{lasted for}} two years due to {{the intention of the}} team behind it to improve <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible. According to Gočeva and the producer Micevski, the group's members' acquaintance with each other helped them in setting the right musical direction with the recording of Makedonsko Devojče 2. Musically, the album is similar to its predecessor; the songs are characterized by elements of Macedonian traditional music, but are adapted to a modern style which is contemporary {{at the time of the}} release of the album, thus intertwining pop and jazz elements. The lyrics cover emotional states of sadness, happiness, love and longing experienced by a mellow woman. The songs were written and composed specifically for Gočeva, taking into account her wide vocal range and musical versatility; all of them are sang without using any backing vocals.|$|E

25|$|Rhodes opposed native liquor {{trafficking}} and suppressed it {{entirely on the}} diamond mines {{at the risk of}} offending some of his supporters among the brandy-farmers of the western provinces. He also restricted <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> he could on native reserves and territories. Nevertheless, liquor trafficking continued on colonial farms and to some extent on in native territory and reserves. The Khoikhoi were particularly fond of the drink as they had been almost completely demoralised from their military losses.|$|E
25|$|Laurents {{was horrified}} {{when he saw}} the first rough cut of the film. He thought there were a few good scenes, and some good moments in bad scenes, but overall {{he thought it was a}} badly photographed jumbled mess lacking coherence. Both stars {{appeared}} to be playing themselves more often than their characters, and Streisand often used a grand accent that Laurents felt hurt her performance. Pollack admitted the film was not good, accepted full responsibility for its problems, and apologized for his behavior. The following day he retreated to the editing room to improve <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible. Laurents felt the changes made it better but never as good as it could have been.|$|E
25|$|For {{listeners}} {{unfamiliar with}} experimental music, Bailey's distinctive style can be challenging. Its most noticeable feature is {{what appears to}} be its extreme discontinuity, often from note to note: there may be enormous intervals between consecutive notes, and rather than aspiring to the consistency of timbre typical of most guitar-playing, Bailey interrupts <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible: four consecutive notes, for instance, may be played on an open string, a fretted string, via harmonics, and using a nonstandard technique such as scraping the string with the pick or plucking below the bridge. Many of the key features of his music—radical discontinuity, the self-contained brevity of each gesture, an attraction to wide intervals—owe much to Bailey's early fascination with Anton Webern, an influence most audible on Bailey's earliest available recordings, Pieces for Guitar (1966–67, issued on Tzadik).|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Monica, he's so wild that <b>it's</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I can do {{to manage}} him at all. He'd destroy himself and me, too, if I {{attempted}} to ride him at such a rattletrap as that." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>It's</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> to state, you begin. If you please, I {{will finish}} the sentence. <b>It</b> is <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> to state--not that I wish to press it or even recall it, {{for it is}} of no use now, and my only wish {{is to make the}} best of {{existing}} circumstances--that from the first to the last I always objected to this match of yours, and at a very late period yielded a most unwilling consent to it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why don't she hire a valet de place, {{and talk}} to him? I'd hire one myself for her. It {{would be a good}} deal cheaper for me. <b>It's</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I can do to stand this weather <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is." ...|$|R
500|$|About Maryland, Nevada {{head coach}} Chris Ault said, [...] "Their offense {{to me is}} very balanced. They can run the ball and do a good job. With [...] Turner, they split out and they have some nice receivers. Whereas Missouri was going to throw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> Texas Tech did, I think Maryland is {{probably}} one of the more balanced teams we've played this year." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player's score is set to the value of 50; their goal is to {{increase}} <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible, for the maximum score of 307. This is done by performing certain actions, finding new areas, solving puzzles, and by finding and keeping treasures and valuable items. In exchange for some of their score, the player can receive hints or get resurrected following an in-game death. The player is ranked in accordance with their score: they start as a [...] "clumsy rookie", and eventually become an [...] "expert on Småland houses". Upon finishing the game, the player gets inducted into the cottage council.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} the {{compilation}} was released, Madonna was riding a wave of publicity {{as a result of}} the film Evita and her pregnancy with daughter Lourdes. Bray decided to cash-in the publicity for the release, although he knew that Madonna would never approve of the album. He said in an interview with Extra that Madonna would receive royalties for the release, and added [...] "There's nothing in these tapes that would be embarrassing, and just hoping that she would like <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> we do." [...] In the European countries, the album was re-titled as In the Beginning, featuring different artwork, and a re-arranged track list.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{only wish}} I had such eyes,' the King remarked in a fretful tone. 'To {{be able to}} see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why, <b>it's</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I can do to see real people, by this light!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, Miss Louisa,' {{answered}} Sissy, {{upon this}} encouragement, shaking her head; 'father knows very little indeed. <b>It's</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> {{he can do}} to write; and it's more than people in general can do to read his writing. Though it's plain to me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They ain't exactly THAT," [...] said Roberts, {{still with}} embarrassment. [...] "The fact is--ye see--the thing points THIS way: they ain't {{no right to}} be here, and <b>it's</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> my place is worth if it leaks out that they are." ...|$|R
500|$|Recognizing McKinley's potential, the Democrats, {{whenever}} they controlled the Ohio legislature, sought to gerrymander or redistrict {{him out of}} office. In 1878, McKinley faced election in a redrawn 17th district; he won anyway, causing Hayes to exult, [...] "Oh, the good luck of McKinley! He was gerrymandered out and then beat the gerrymander! We enjoyed <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> he did." [...] After the 1882 election, McKinley was unseated on an election contest by a near party-line House vote. Out of office, he was briefly depressed by the setback, but soon vowed to run again. The Democrats again redistricted Stark County for the 1884 election; McKinley was returned to Congress anyway.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the first}} film was commended for leaving the shark to the {{imagination}} until {{two thirds of the}} way through, Szwarc felt that they should show <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible because the dramatic [...] "first image of it coming out of the water" [...] in {{the first film}} could never be repeated. Szwarc believed that the reduction of the first film's Hitchcockian suspense was inevitable because the audience already knew what the shark looked like from the first film. Reviewers have since commented {{that there was no way}} that they were ever going to duplicate the original's effectiveness. The filmmakers gave the new shark a more menacing look by scarring it in the early boat explosion.|$|E
500|$|Nelson, who on {{surveying}} the bay {{on the morning}} of 2 August said, [...] "Victory is not a name strong enough for such a scene", remained at anchor in Aboukir Bay for the next two weeks, preoccupied with recovering from his wound, writing dispatches, and assessing the military situation in Egypt using documents captured on board one of the prizes. Nelson's head wound was recorded as being [...] "three inches long" [...] with [...] "the cranium exposed for one inch". He suffered pain from the injury {{for the rest of his}} life and was badly scarred, styling his hair to disguise <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible. As their commander recovered, his men stripped the wrecks of useful supplies and made repairs to their ships and prizes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, young gents, why {{will you}} come larking here to get a poor chap out of his situation. <b>It's</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> my place is worth not to summons you, and yet I don't half {{like to do it}} to young gents like you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, I say, laddie, I don't want {{to spoil}} your day and {{disappoint}} you and so forth, but my jolly old father-in-law {{would never let}} me keep a snake. Why, <b>it's</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I {{can do to make}} him let me stop on in the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hirst? Oh, he's one {{of these}} learned chaps," [...] said Arthur indifferently. [...] "He don't {{look as if he}} enjoyed it.

500|$|Reviews of Lansbury's {{performance}} were overwhelmingly positive. In The New York Times, Stanley Kauffmann wrote: [...] "Miss Lansbury is a singing-dancing actress, not {{a singer}} or dancer who also acts... In this marathon role she has wit, poise, warmth {{and a very}} taking [...]" [...] The role resulted in Lansbury receiving her first Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical. Lansbury's later biographer Margaret Bonanno claimed that Mame made Lansbury a [...] "superstar", with the actress herself commenting on her success by stating that [...] "Everyone loves you, everyone loves the success, and enjoys <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> you do. And it lasts {{as long as you}} are on that stage and as long as you keep coming out of that stage door." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the single by the {{relatively}} small Trumpet Records led other record companies to pursue James {{in the hope of}} landing his follow-up singles. [...] Joe Bihari, who owned Los Angeles-based Modern Records with his brothers, and his talent scout Ike Turner were one of the first. [...] A later session in Chicago produced [...] "I Believe", a [...] "Dust My Broom" [...] knockoff, that became a number nine charting single and the first issued on the new Modern subsidiary Meteor Records in 1953. [...] Being able to score two hits within a year with essentially the same song by the same artist prompted record companies to exploit <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible. Thus, many re-workings of [...] "Dust My Broom" [...] with small variations were recorded by James for different record labels during his career.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{covers of}} seven songs, including a mash-up of [...] "Don't Stand So Close to Me" [...] by The Police and [...] "Young Girl" [...] by Gary Puckett and The Union Gap. Studio recordings of all songs {{performed in the}} episode were released as singles, available for digital download. [...] "Ballad" [...] was watched by 7.29 million US viewers and received mixed reviews from critics. Elizabeth Holmes of The Wall Street Journal and Liz Pardue of Zap2it were disappointed that Jane Lynch did not appear as Sue Sylvester, though Mike Hale of the New York Times did not miss her presence. Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle deemed [...] "Ballad" [...] {{one of the best}} episodes of Glee to date. Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly did not enjoy <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the preceding episode [...] "Wheels" [...] but reviewed the episode positively overall, while Eric Zorn of the Chicago Tribune deemed it [...] "deliriously, deliciously bad".|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, yes," [...] said Mr. Macey; [...] "but I daresay <b>it's</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> this Mr. Lammeter's done {{to keep it}} whole.
