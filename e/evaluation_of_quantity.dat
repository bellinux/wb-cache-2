40|$|Developmental {{research}} has shown thatthe home environment may serve as aprotective factor for children(1). Homeenvironment scores {{were found to be}} significantly related to mental development, independent of parental education and occupation(2). It is suggested that early social environment plays a role in mediating establishment of neural networks that regulate a child’s response to stress and capacity for self-control(3). The quality of mother infant interaction and the presence of age appropriate play materials may be used as a surrogate for the <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> and quality of stimulation available at home. Healthy brain development depend upon the care and support provided by individuals in the community {{as well as in the}} family(4). The Home Screening Questionnaire (HSQ) serves as a quick, simple and economical parent-answered questionnaire for evaluating the quality of the family environment promoting child development(5). The advantage of HSQ is that it can be used in routine clinical situations. It can also be used by health, daycare and social services personnel, in place of the Home Observation for the Measurement of Environment (HOME) inventory, which requires time consuming home visits and direct observations(6). The present study was done to validate the screening tool Home Screening Questionnaire (HSQ) against Home Observation for the Measurement of Environment (HOME) inventory, using diagnostic test evaluation. METHODS The screening tool HSQ and the gold standard HOME inventory were administered by separate observers, among families with children less than 3 years of age, belonging to 14 anganwadi area...|$|E
40|$|We {{simulated}} {{the vital}} situation of risky {{hunting in the}} striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius {{in order to examine}} whether these animals are able to make a choice between small and large quantities of live prey (ants). In the first (preliminary) experiment we investigated to what extent mice were interested in ants as a live prey and how their hunting activity depended on the quantity of these edible but rather aggressive insects. We placed mice one by one into arenas together with ant groups of different size, from 10 to 60. Surprisingly, animals, both wild-caught and laboratory-reared, displayed rather skilled predatory attacks: mice killed and ate from 0. 37 &# 177; 003 to 4 &# 177; 0. 5 ants per minute. However, there was a threshold number of ants in the arenas when rodents expressed signs of discomfort and started to panic, because ants bit them. This threshold corresponds to the dynamic density (about 400 individuals per m 2 per min) in the vicinity of anthills and ants’ routes in natural environment. In the second experiment mice had to choose between different quantities of ants placed in two transparent tunnels. Ants here served both as food items and as a source of danger. As far as we know, this is the first experimental paradigm based on <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> judgements in the context of risk/reward decision making where the animals face a trade-off between the hedonistic value of the prey and the danger it presents [...] We found that when mice have to choose between 5 vs 15, 5 vs 30 and 10 vs 30 ants, they always tend to prefer the smaller quantity, thus displaying the capacity for distinguishing more from less in order to ensure comfortable hunting. The results of this study are ecologically relevant as they reflect situations and challenges faced by free-living small rodents...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} measure {{agriculture}} sustainability, the {{efficient use of}} inputs becomes a crucial issue. In this perspective, the analysts concentrate their attention on the total factor productivity index (TFP). In this view, Lynam and Herdt (1989) proposed the TFP as a suitable assessment of the sustainability of single crops, of cropping systems or of farming systems. Even if the TFP {{does not take into}} account the non-market output (social and environmental aspects), it is possible to argue that a negative trend of TFP represents a resources’ degradation if related to the generated outputs. On the other hand, the non-negative trend of TFP represents a fitting measure of a sustainable agricultural system and of an efficient use of the resources. The aim of the paper is to analyze the productivity in the use of external factors in different types of farming at the Emilia-Romagna Region level, i. e. specialist field crops, specialist permanent crops and specialist milk production farms. A significant number of indexing procedures is accessible to evaluate the efficiency in converting inputs into outputs. In this paper, the TFP is estimated through an indirect <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> index of outputs and inputs of each farming system taken into account in the analysis. Purposely, the amount of the total sales is considered as a measure of the output, whereas labour, capital, external inputs and other intermediate consumption are considered as a measure of the inputs. Data, referred to the period 2000 – 2009, are collected from the farm accountancy data network of the Emilia Romagna Region DG Agriculture. The study highlights how the TFP is a convenient index to evaluate the efficiency in the use of resources. In a broader view, the TFP index trend allows an estimation of economical and social benefits or damages which in the end improves or worsens environmental quality.
