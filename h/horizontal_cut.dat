25|$|The {{share is}} {{the cutting edge}} of the {{moldboard}} plow. The share makes the <b>horizontal</b> <b>cut</b> that separates the furrow slice from the soil below and when it is worn it is important to fit a new one. Conventional shares have points that are shaped. This shape, which was developed through years of field experience, penetrates ordinary soil efficiently and stands rough use. The share is shaped so that it pulls itself into the ground. As the share wears away, it becomes blunt and the plough will require more power to pull it through the soil. A plough body with a worn share will not have enough 'suck' to ensure that it penetrates the ground to its full working depth. The tip of the share is pointed downward, causing the plow to run into the ground. This is called “suction or down suck”; it literally sucks the plow into the ground, to a regulated depth. The clearance, also usually referred to as “suction or down suck”, varies with different makes and types of plows (the related clearance at the side is called “land suck”). Its configuration is related to soil type, particularly in the down suction, or concavity, of its lower surface. Generally, three degrees of clearance or down suction are recognized: regular for light soil, deep for ordinary dry soil, and double-deep for clay and gravelly soils. In addition, the share has horizontal suction, which is related to the amount its point is bent out of line with the landside. Down suction causes the plow to penetrate to proper depth when pulled forward, while horizontal suction causes the plow to create the desired width of furrow. The share is a plane part with trapezoidal shape. It cuts the soil horizontally and lifts it. Common types are regular, winged-plane, bar-point, and share with mounted or welded point. The regular share conserves a good cut but is recommended on stone-free soils. The winged-plane share is used on heavy soil with a moderate amount of stones. The bar-point share can be used in extreme conditions (hard and stony soils). The use of the share with mounted point is somewhere between the last two types. Manufacturers have designed shares of various shapes (trapezium, diamond, etc.) with bolted point and wings, often separately renewable. Sometimes the share cutting edge is placed well in advance of the moldboard to reduce the pulverizing action of the soil.|$|E
500|$|Archaeological {{findings}} in the late 20th century {{shed light on the}} final moments of the battle. In 1996 workmen at a construction site in the town of Towton uncovered a mass grave, which archaeologists believed to contain the remains of men who were slain during or after the battle in 1461. The bodies showed severe injuries to their upper torsos; arms and skulls were cracked or shattered. [...] One exhumed specimen, known as Towton 25, had the front of his skull bisected: a weapon had slashed across his face, cutting a deep wound that split the bone. The skull was also pierced by another deep wound, a <b>horizontal</b> <b>cut</b> from a blade across the back.|$|E
500|$|SCI {{has been}} known to be devastating for millennia; the ancient Egyptian Edwin Smith Papyrus from 2500 BC, the first known {{description}} of the injury, says it is [...] "not to be treated". [...] Hindu texts dating back to 1800 BC also mention SCI and describe traction techniques to straighten the spine. [...] The [...] Greek physician Hippocrates, born in the fifth century BC, described SCI in his Hippocratic Corpus and invented traction devices to straighten dislocated vertebrae. But it was not until Aulus Cornelius Celsus, born 30 BC, noted that a cervical injury resulted in rapid death that the spinal cord itself was implicated in the condition. In the second century AD the Greek physician Galen experimented on monkeys and reported that a <b>horizontal</b> <b>cut</b> through the spinal cord caused them to lose all sensation and motion below the level of the cut. The seventh-century Greek physician Paul of Aegina described surgical techniques for treatment of broken vertebrae by removing bone fragments, as well as surgery to relieve pressure on the spine. [...] Little medical progress was made during the Middle Ages in Europe; {{it was not until the}} Renaissance that the spine and nerves were accurately depicted in human anatomy drawings by Leonardo da Vinci and Andreas Vesalius.|$|E

2500|$|Methods {{for cutting}} a block can vary {{depending}} on the formation and other factors, but usually involve three types of saws (wire and two chain types of which all three are diamond edged).

[...] Next is the back cut with a wire saw followed by chain saws to cut the vertical sides. [...] A metal bag is then inserted behind the back cut and filled with water, which pushes the block away from the rock face (on the metal rollers). [...] The block is then rigged for lifting by forklift and placed on a haul truck and driven out of the mountain and down to the staging area {{on the grounds of the}} old mill site.

Mondino goes on to describe the organs in the order in which they present themselves during the dissection process. Dissection began {{with the opening of the}} abdominal cavity via vertical incision running from the stomach to the pectoral muscles and a <b>horizontal</b> <b>cut</b> above the navel. First, the musculature of the intestinal tract is described in detail, followed by an extensive discussion of the form, function, and position of the stomach. According to the text, the stomach is spherical; the stomach wall has an internal lining, which is [...] "the seat of sensation", and an external fleshy coat that is involved in digestion. In order to access the spleen, which was thought to secrete black bile into the stomach through imaginary canals, the dissector was required to remove the [...] "false ribs". The liver is said to have five lobes, the gallbladder is described as the seat of yellow bile, and the cecum is described with no mention of the vermiform appendix. Though Anathomia only vaguely describes the pancreas, the pancreatic duct is discussed in greater detail. He also makes new observations regarding the anatomy of the bladder and the enlargement of the uterus during both menstruation and pregnancy.|$|E

5000|$|Bark was cut {{and pulled}} {{as soon as}} the sap began to run, which varied {{regionally}} from late May to July. While carving was typically done by men, the harvesting of bark was performed by women. Straight young trees were chosen, and only a portion was debarked to ensure the tree's survival. Thousands of culturally modified trees with scars from past bark harvesting can now be found along the Pacific Northwest coastline. [...] On the side with the fewest branches, above the flare of the tree's roots, a woman would make a <b>horizontal</b> <b>cut</b> the width of two fingers. She would make a small vertical cut then on either end of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>cut.</b> She would then use a small wedge to pry the bark away from the trunk enough for her to grip securely. Holding this end of the bark, she would then walk away from the tree slowly, drawing a ribbon of bark off the tree. For the bark quality to prove good for weaving, the strip should run at least twenty feet before narrowing to a point.|$|E
