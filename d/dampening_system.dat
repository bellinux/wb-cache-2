To overcome this, four-mallet players use a set of dampening techniques referred to as [...] "mallet dampening", in addition to the pedaling techniques used by two-mallet players. The mallet dampening techniques [...] "are to the vibist as garlic and fresh basil are to the Northern Italian chef" [...] and contribute significantly to expressive four-mallet playing.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{innovations}} {{and technical}} refinements {{have been made}} in printing processes and presses over the years, including the development of presses with multiple units (each containing one printing plate) that can print multi-color images in one pass {{on both sides of the}} sheet, and presses that accommodate continuous rolls (webs) of paper, known as web presses. Another innovation was the continuous <b>dampening</b> <b>system</b> first introduced by Dahlgren instead of the old method which is still used on older presses (conventional dampening), which are rollers covered with molleton (cloth) that absorbs the water. This increased control of the water flow to the plate and allowed for better ink and water balance. Current dampening systems include a [...] "delta effect or vario," [...] which slows the roller in contact with the plate, thus creating a sweeping movement over the ink image to clean impurities known as [...] "hickies".|$|E
5000|$|Head's latest {{vibration}} <b>dampening</b> <b>system</b> is EDS (Electronic <b>Dampening</b> <b>System)</b> {{which is}} being implemented into the newer rackets, such as the HEAD Protector. It works by using piezoelectric fibers, which convert mechanical into electronic energy, controlled by a microchip. EDS recognizes the damping mode and electronically creates a cancelling counter vibration. This reduces shock impact by more than 50% and residual vibrations {{twice as fast as}} in a conventional racquet period.|$|E

5000|$|Indirect <b>dampening</b> <b>systems</b> (or {{integrated}} <b>dampening</b> <b>systems)</b> {{feed the}} water directly {{into one of}} the ink form rollers (ink rollers that touch the offset plate) via a water form roller in contact with it. These systems are known as [...] "indirect" [...] since the water travels to the offset plate passing through the inking system and not directly to the offset plate as direct systems do. Some indirect systems will have the ability to feed the water into the inking system {{as well as to the}} offset plate. A fine emulsion of ink and water is then developed on the ink form roller. This is one reason printers need to know about [...] "water pickup" [...] or what percentage of water can be taken up by the ink. These systems are also known as [...] "integrated" [...] <b>dampening</b> <b>systems</b> as they are integrated into the inking system. One of the benefits of these systems, is that they do not use covers thus they react more quickly when dampening changes are made. One generally finds this type of <b>dampening</b> <b>systems</b> on newer and faster press equipment today.|$|R

50|$|Waterless {{printing}} is an offset {{lithographic printing}} process that eliminates {{the water or}} <b>dampening</b> <b>system</b> used in conventional printing. It uses silicone rubber coated printing plates and specially formulated inks, and typically a temperature-control system is integrated into waterless presses. Waterless offset presses do not use dampening solution to keep the plate's nonimage areas free of ink. These presses function because the plate's nonimage areas consist of a layer of silicon that repels ink. A waterless press resembles a conventional offset press, except the <b>dampening</b> <b>system</b> might be missing. A more common design, however, includes a <b>dampening</b> <b>system</b> to allow the press to function conventionally when needed. Direct imaging (digital) offset presses are waterless, with no dampening system.Waterless offset inks have a higher tack and viscosity (thickness) and are generally stiffer than conventional offset inks. The temperature of the inks must be strictly controlled to maintain the correct viscosity because the plate surface is designed to repel inks of a specific viscosity. This temperature distinction is achieved by running chilled water through tubing in the hollow cores {{of two or more}} vibrating rollers in the ink train on the printing press.|$|E

50|$|Direct <b>dampening</b> <b>systems</b> {{employ a}} water {{fountain}} roller which {{picks up the}} water from the water fountain. The water is then passed to a water distribution roller. From here the water is transferred to the offset plate via one or two water form rollers.|$|R
50|$|Most lithographic plates {{function}} on {{the principle}} of water and ink receptive areas. In order for ink to adhere only to the image areas on the plate, a layer of moisture must be placed over the nonimage areas. The <b>dampening</b> <b>system</b> accomplishes this by moistening the plate consistently throughout the press run.|$|E
50|$|Many designs take {{advantage}} of the maintenance-free state of constant readiness. For example, a hydraulic dampener protecting a structure from earthquake damage could be secured with a shear pin. During normal conditions the system would be completely rigid, but when acted upon by the force of an earthquake the shear pin would break and the hydraulic <b>dampening</b> <b>system</b> would operate.|$|E

By using a ship-system called the {{inertial}} <b>dampening</b> <b>system</b> (IDS) the player {{can choose to}} let the ship automatically adapt the course to the cockpit orientation or to let the ship keep its current heading and speed to turn the ship freely during flight {{due to the lack}} of friction in space.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dampening</b> <b>systems</b> are {{important}} in heavy vehicles utilized in rough terrains, with purpose to reduce shocks and vibrations with negative influences on the vehicle and, more importantly, on the operator of the vehicle. During the years the heavy vehicles require sturdier construction parts, due to demands on higher load capacity, where the easy solution to scale up the construction parts is not always applicable for <b>dampening</b> <b>systems</b> with nonlinear behavior. Hence, the sturdiness {{in the design of}} these <b>dampening</b> <b>systems</b> requires improvement. In this thesis the design of the rubber spring used as rubber spring in Volvo’s articulated hauler A 40 G is treated. The aim of this thesis is to find alternative design solutions on the rubber spring, improving its lifetime. The usual failure of these rubber springs is crack propagation in the rubber body. In the method of this thesis, alternative design solution are generated in concepts though brain storming, which are adjusted to achieve the desired behavior of the rubber spring through calculations and tested in performance through simulations in Abaqus. From analyzing the generated data, it is concluded that among the tested design solutions, a combination of fewer plates and shaping the plates as thin bowls, results in highest potential increase in lifetime...|$|R
50|$|Intermittent-flow <b>dampening</b> <b>systems</b> (direct or indirect) use a water ductor roller {{to pick up}} {{the water}} and {{transfer}} it to a water distribution roller. A drawback of these systems is the slow reaction time in making adjustments due to the back and forth action of the ductor.|$|R
5000|$|Continuous-flow <b>dampening</b> <b>systems</b> (direct or indirect), {{are used}} by most newer presses today {{because they do not}} have the slow {{reaction}} time of intermittent-flow <b>dampening</b> <b>systems.</b> They do not employ the water ductor roller but use the water slip roller (a roller in contact with both the water fountain roller and a distribution roller, contrary to the water ductor roller that moves back and forth between the two) for a continuous flow. The speed of the water slip roller controls the supply. The use of alcohol on these type of dampeners was standard for years. Alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) was used as it increased the water viscosity and made it [...] "more wettable" [...] so that transfer was easier from one roller to the other. However, alcohol substitutes such as glycol ethers, butyl cellusolve, etc., are being used today to accomplish the same task because alcohol contains volatile organic compounds. Roller hardness is also being changed to help accomplish the same job—easy transfer of the water.|$|R

40|$|Printing; is {{the process}} of {{reproduction}} rapid transfering of the images, inscriptions, figures and graphics on to a surface in the original format. The <b>dampened</b> <b>system</b> offset printing is the smooth printing system. Smooth printing is based on the principal of repelling of the water by the oil inside the ink and not to be mixed with. The printed and unprinted surfaces on the plate has a chemical characteristic. The process of printing occurs in the way that. The unprinted areas captures water and repell ink, the printed areas captures ink and repell water. The dry offset system is; the combination of the flexo and <b>dampened</b> <b>system</b> offset methods. In the method the relief part of the plate transfers the image to the smooth surfaced rubber printing cylinder and the image is transferred to the material by the cylinder. Water is not needed for humidification. So the plate is not wetted before printing. The pictures or positive dias are not printed by dry ofset method but, the hand dravings, very detailed desings and quite small texts could be printed to the range of six colors. In this study, an evaluation of the comparison of the process stages and reproduction results of the two techniques is conducted...|$|R

40|$|An {{algorithm}} is presented which computes a state feedback for a standard linear system {{which not only}} stabilizes, but also <b>dampens</b> the closed-loop <b>system</b> dynamics.

This may be accomplished by solving one periodic algebraic Riccati equation and one degenerate Riccati equation. The solution to these equations are computed using numerically robust algorithms. Finally, the periodic Riccati equation is unusual in that it produces one symmetric and one skew symmetric solution, and as a result two different state feedbacks. Both feedbacks <b>dampen</b> the <b>system</b> dynamics, but produce different closed-loop eigenvalues, giving the controller designer greater freedom in choosing a desired feedback...|$|R
