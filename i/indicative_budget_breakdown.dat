40|$|This paper {{describes}} and contrasts {{approaches that}} are typically employed {{to define and}} assess living standards and needs. The paper notes that because many aspects of living standards cannot be directly observed, research typically relies on one or more indicators of living standards. The most common of these in Australian research is income, and the paper explores key income benchmarks: the Henderson poverty lines; relative poverty lines based on estimates of median or mean equivalised household disposable income; and <b>indicative</b> <b>budget</b> standards developed by the Budget Standards Unit of the Social Policy Research Centre in the 1990 s. It notes that recent research has also focused on expenditure, assets or wealth, financial stress and/or material deprivation.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the Sahel region of Africa is {{impacted}} by decadal scale variability in precipitation, driven by global sea surface temperatures. This work demonstrates that the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s Community Atmosphere Model, version 4 is capable of reproducing relationships between Sahelian precipitation variability and Indian and Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperature variations on such timescales. Further analysis then constructs a moisture <b>budget</b> <b>breakdown</b> using model output and shows that the change in precipitation minus evaporation in the region is dominated by column integrated moisture convergence due to the mean flow, with the convergence of mass in the atmospheric column mainly responsible. It is concluded that the oceanic forcing of atmospheric mass convergence and divergence to a first order explains the moisture balance patterns in the region. In particular, the anomalous circulation patterns, including net moisture divergence by the mean and transient flows combined with negative moisture advection, together explain the drying of the Sahel {{during the second half of}} the twentieth century. Diagnosis of moisture budget and circulation components within the main rainbelt and along the monsoon margins show that changes to the mass convergence are related to the magnitude of precipitation that falls in the region, while the advection of dry air is associated with the maximum latitudinal extent of precipitation...|$|R
40|$|Do low-income {{households}} in receipt {{of a public}} housing rent rebate or of private sector rent assistance have enough for an adequate standard of living after paying rents? How have housing and related expenditure for low-income households changed since the mid seventies? This paper summarises a study which uses unit record data from the ABS Household Expenditures Survey (HES) {{to answer these questions}} as well as to provide other housing expenditure analysis such as long term trends in home ownership, the debt levels of low income renters, and their perception of their general well being. The major part of the paper is however concerned with evaluating the effects of rent subsidies on tenant well-being. In public housing over the last three or so decades there has been a progressive move from a residual rent model in public housing (which assumes rents should set at what is left after a household's other costs are paid for) to a rent-first model (i. e. rent is taken out before other expenditures). What does the move from one rent setting model in social housing to another mean for public tenants and how has rent assistance helped private renters? To answer these questions the study used the Social Policy Research Centre (SPRC) <b>indicative</b> <b>budget</b> standard for Australia to determine whether, and to what degree, households fell below the budget standard even after receiving rent subsidy.

40|$|In 1998, the Department of Social Security {{released}} {{a report on the}} development of <b>indicative</b> <b>budget</b> standards for Australia, by a group of researchers at the Social Policy Research Centre. This paper explains the methodology used in the research, including a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the budget standards approach, and illustrates these by presenting estimates of the costs of children. A budget standard identifies the goods and services required to attain a given standard of living, and then prices them to arrive at the budget that corresponds to the standard. The research derives budgets for a broad range of Australian households at two separate standards: ‘modest but adequate’ and ‘low cost’. The modest but adequate standard broadly corresponds to what is needed in contemporary Australia to allow full participation in Australian society, falling between the standards of decency and survival {{on the one hand and}} luxury on the other. The low cost standard is one which still allows a degree of social and economic participation consistent with community standards, but may require frugal and careful management of resources. Budgets have been developed at the two standards for a total of 46 different household types. One advantage of the budget standards approach is that it allows estimates to be derived of the costs for additional household members, by comparing the estimates for different household types at the same standard of living. The paper explains how this is achieved in practice and illustrates the method by analysing the estimates of the costs of children produced from the research and comparing these estimates with the level of child support payments. ...|$|R

Focus <b>budget</b> <b>breakdown</b> studies [Ref 1, 5] show {{that even though the}} intrafield component stays the same this becomes a larger relative percentage of the overall DOF. Process induced topography along with reduced Process Window can lead to yield limitations and defectivity issues on the wafer. To improve focus margin, a study has been started to determine if some correlations between scanner levelling performance, product layout and topography can be observed. Both topography and levelling intrafield fingerprints show a large systematic component that seems to be product related. In particular, scanner levelling measurement maps present a lot of similarities with the layout of the product. The present paper investigates the possibility to model the level sensor's measured height as a function of layer design densities or perimeter data of the product. As one component of the systematics from the level sensor measurements is process induced topography due to previous deposition, etching and CMP, several layer density parameters were extracted from the GDS's. These were combined through a multiple variable analysis (PLS: Partial Least Square regression) to determine the weighting of each layer and each parameter. Current work shows very promising results using this methodology, with description quality up to 0. 8 R² and expected prediction quality up to 0. 78 Q². Since product layout drives some intrafield focus component {{it is also important to}} be able to assess intrafield focus uniformity from post processing. This has been done through a hyper dense focus map experiment which is presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Shopping the Look” is a cultural, historical, {{industrial}} {{analysis of the}} production and consumption practices around film costume and consumer fashion during the 1960 s. This work identifies a fundamental shift in costuming practices in the post-studio era and demonstrates how changing methods of costume production altered the relationship between female filmgoers and fashion marketing that had been established in the studio era. Through an analysis of archival documents like studio wardrobe records, production memos, and <b>budget</b> <b>breakdowns,</b> this project creates a history of changing production cultures within wardrobe departments. Concurrent with this story of production, “Shopping the Look” tells a story of consumption by examining the cultural landscape of film promotion and fashion advertising aimed at white, middle-class women in the 1960 s. Through an analysis of studio marketing materials, film reviews, fashion show programs, and advertising in women’s magazines, this project shows that locations of consumption became diffused and diverse during the period, further displacing the cinema as a site of marketing address for female consumers. Methodologically, this project engages archival research, textual analysis, and media industries analysis. It is further situated within several frameworks that include: industrial histories of film costume, studies of post-studio American film, production culture & media industry studies, gender and consumption studies, cultural histories of the 1960 s, and fashion & design cultures of the 1960 s. Working among these intersections, “Shopping the Look” brings together a range of discourses to think more deeply {{about the ways in}} which costume functions both onscreen and off, and to think about the complicated relationships among women, the cinema, and consumer culture during a period characterized industrially by massive studio reorganization and culturally by shifting attitudes about gender, the family, and the home. The goal of this project is to provide a heretofore untold history of post-studio costume departments that reaches past existing paradigms about gender and consumption to reconsider the means, and sites, through which the cinema addressed women. Ultimately, “Shopping the Look” is interested in the ways that women negotiated questions of consumerism, stardom, ideological positioning, and constructions of femininity through costume and fashion in the 1960 s...|$|R

Even if these services are diverse and delivered by various entities such as government agencies, enterprises or NGOâ€™s, they do have something in common; they cannot generate incomes, but costs for implementing entities. But costs according to the sound financial management principle calls for tracing money with eligible activities using at least some if not all of management accounting concepts. Without some specifics from the donor or a mutual accepted best practice model, most of the ESF beneficiaries are reporting their efforts to actual researches and specialized literature regarding management accounting implementation in services delivering activities. This study was realized in March 2012 by applying an investigation instrument, an on-line questionnaire collecting both opinions and factual data as well to a number of 962 members of a practice community for ESF interventions implementation. This technique was used to test hypotheses regarding the premises for a future improvement of the existing accounting system model by incorporating management accounting. 130 members of this community answered anonymously, revealing an important concern for management accounting usage, even if only less than 15 % declared that they organize it continuously. The rest of more than 85 % perceive an important concern about tracing money with <b>budget</b> <b>breakdowns</b> and activities within their projects, just about 65 % of them considering also that their work is different now in an ESF project than in past situations. More than 83 % of the ones organizing management accounting stated that their actual work is different than in past situations.

Some other conclusions about interactions between the accounting and internal control systems may be drawn from the way that community members perceive communication from and to the accountant. Possible weaknesses of the internal control system may lead to unpleasant effects for sound financial management.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the healthcare costs of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in the Netherlands, in 1993. Also studied was the future development of these costs, as a result of ageing and possible changes in smoking behavior. A prevalence-based cost-of-illness approach was used to estimate direct medical costs. Age- and gender-specific data were obtained from representative national registries and large, representative surveys. To model future costs, cost estimates were linked to an epidemiological model based on a dynamic multi-state lifetable. It describes 1 yr changes, from one state to another, that result from ageing, birth, migration, incidence, recovery from asthma and death due to asthma, COPD or other causes, and starting or quitting smoking. Three different scenarios were modelled: 1) a reference scenario which primarily predicts the impact of ageing. 2) an ‘attainable’ smoking reduction scenario and 3) an ‘extreme’ smoking reduction scenario. Direct medical costs were estimated to be $US 346 million in 1993. With increasing age, the relative importance of asthma in total asthma and COPD costs decreased from 91 % to less than 4 %. Annual costs per patient were estimated to be $US 499 for asthma and $US 876 for COPD. The breakdown of costs differed considerably between asthma and COPD. The reference scenario predicted the costs to increase by 60 % to reach $US 555 million by 2010. COPD prevention as modelled in the second and the third scenario reduced the projected cost increase from 60 %, to 57 % and 48 %, respectively. Together, the direct costs of asthma and COPD represent 1 · 3 % of the Dutch health care <b>budget.</b> The <b>breakdown</b> of the costs shows different patterns for asthma and COPD. The costs of these diseases are expected to increase by 60 % in the near future. In the short run the impact of smoking reduction on reducing this increase is relatively small, but it will be greater in the long run...|$|R

In this regime, specialized, energy-efficient processors can increase parallelism by reducing the per-computation power requirements and allowing more computations to execute under the same power budget. To pursue this goal, this paper introduces conservation cores. Conservation cores, or c-cores, are specialized processors that focus on reducing energy and energy-delay instead of increasing performance. This focus on energy makes c-cores an excellent match for many applications that would be poor candidates for hardware acceleration (e. g., irregular integer codes). We present a toolchain for automatically synthesizing c-cores from application source code and demonstrate that they can significantly reduce energy and energy-delay {{for a wide range}} of applications. The c-cores support patching, a form of targeted reconfigurability, that allows them to adapt to new versions of the software they target. Our results show that conservation cores can reduce energy consumption by up to 16. 0 × for functions and by up to 2. 1 × for whole applications, while patching can extend the useful lifetime of individual c-cores to match that of conventional processors...|$|R

Purpose, ethos and means are distinguished; method of taking internal and external appraisals and adopting the effective strategic plan is explained. Organization and strategy being interdependent requires the organization to suit the strategy which in turn is suitable for achieving these objectives. The point of providing the services to the requirements and standards (up to a certain extent) of the owners (and not enforcing the standards of managers) is stressed. The aim is to optimise the resources at hand and achieve the objectives of both owner and manager. Then ship management and its components are examined in detail giving consideration to both theoretical and practicl aspects. Weak areas in ship management are exposed and theoretical principles applied to achieve improved results. Important and modem techniques for controlling <b>budgets</b> and reducing <b>breakdowns</b> which in turn reduces the off-hire time are explained as is the utmost importance of having an efficient communication system to speed up the operations. Various types of shipowners and institutions who require their ships to be managed, are examined so that an effective system can be formulated to suit the requirements of individual owners. Then six British ship management companies are investigated and results are compared. This highlights the strong and weak points of ship management.

Much to the frustration of some of my sources inside the ABC, the Minister has yet to announce this. It 2 ̆ 7 s becoming a characteristic of the Rudd Government 2 ̆ 7 s approach to communications. Make in principal decisions, then take forever to get them out there [...] The conventional wisdom is that the blockage lies in the Prime Minister 2 ̆ 7 s office. My understanding is that there were originally plans for a white paper style of exercise, but that these were pulled back into a short, sharp and limited inquiry, designed to influence the triennial funding decisions. In some ways this is a shame. In this time of media change, a white paper on public broadcasting might be a very useful thing, but there are cans of worms involved that nobody wants to open. One of them is the justification for public broadcasting in an age of media plenty. Let 2 ̆ 7 s track some of the undertow as the triennial funding submissions are prepared. At the CCI conference last June, ABC head of television Kim Dalton delivered a speech which was a politic and politely phrased but nevertheless passionate plea for the government to stop being such a nerd, get its head out of its orifice and start thinking about what the ABC could do. Dalton protested that at present all the big thinking in government is about the "tubes" communications infrastructure, and broadband in particular - rather than what goes through them. While reminding everyone that the government had promised to lift Australian content levels on the ABC, and protesting great confidence that this promise would be fulfilled, he outlined how the national broadcaster could sit at the heart of innovation in drama, education and the creative life of the nation - if it had the money. But is there anyone in government with ears to hear this kind of message? Nobody seems to know - not even those with the best access. Meanwhile the ABC is doing its best with very little cash. Last month, as anyone who watches the promos on the ABC must surely be aware, it launched ABC iView, Australia 2 ̆ 7 s first free internet based television service. All well and good, although it does raise a fundamental question: to what extent is this broadcasting, given that individual consumers can dial up what they want when they want it. And isn 2 ̆ 7 t broadcasting what the ABC is for? Certainly that is what the ABC Charter says - but more of this later. Meanwhile there are worrying signs for the sorts of big creative thinking in government that might favour public broadcasting and a vibrant arts sector more generally. For example, the government has committed 17 million to a Creative Industries and Innovations Centre - part of the Enterprise Connect election commitment. This should be a beacon to creatives and artists everywhere, and the ABC should be part of it - but the signs are not good. Rather than being in the portfolio of Arts Minister Peter Garrett, it sits with Industry Minister Kim Carr. People in the arts community and the production houses that feed the ABC have noted with distress that the <b>indicative</b> <b>budget</b> shows that 14 million of the dosh will be tied up in consultants and bureaucracy. Only a measly 3 million will be available to partner organisations to actually come up with ideas. Those in the know fear this centre will be more about control and narrow political agendas than about edgy and creative ideas. The other great white hope is the Innovation Review, presently being led by Terry Cutler, which is expected to lead into a full white paper on innovation. But will the arts, let alone the public broadcasters, have a place? The Cutler inquiry met to consider its draft recommendations in June but, as reported by the Australian this week, has now missed its end of July reporting deadline. What 2 ̆ 7 s going on? Perhaps some last minute lobbying by the arts industry and others, who were notably thin on the ground when submissions were made. ABC watchers are hoping for something to help the national broadcaster, and the ABC made a submission once again pitching its case to sit at the heart of cultural innovation. (SBS did not make a submission.) There are people on Cutler 2 ̆ 7 s panel who have been thinking about public broadcasting for sometime. One of them is blogger and economist Nicholas Gruen, who earlier this year blogged on the future of the ABC. He had an extensive agenda - much broader and somewhat different from that coming from within the ABC. He recommended, for example, that the ABC should post its entire archive on the web for downloading by whoever wanted to use it. Rather than charging for downloads - which has been mooted by ABC Managing Director Mark Scott - as much as possible should be for free. The cultural benefits would far outweigh the benefits of the revenue, said Gruen. Gruen also wanted the ABC to embrace creative commons licensing, go further to embrace public comment on programming and embrace openness in planning programs by using the interactive capabilities of the internet. Websites could foreshadow possible and planned programs. This would enable commentators to suggest talent for various discussions, they could thrash through some of the arguments in a particular area and suggest angles they 2 ̆ 7 d like covered. Gruen seems to be suggesting the ABC should get in to crowd sourcing: The ABC should scour the resources of Web 2. 0 and community broadcasting more fully both in Australia and elsewhere with a view both to bringing them to greater [mainstream media] prominence and also to supporting their growth. "I 2 ̆ 7 d like to see the ABC make a more concerted effort to be part of the leaven with which the great broadcasters of the future are discovered". Those ideas go well beyond the more controlled plea for more money coming from the ABC. At the 2020 Summit the ABC 2 ̆ 7 s managing director Mark Scott made his pitch for more money, outlining a vision of a multi-channel ABC rich in Australian content. But the final report of the relevant panel went much further, calling for new charters for the ABC and SBS to reflect the changing times. Meanwhile there is pressure both within and outside the organisation for the ABC to be even braver than it has been in embracing new media innovation. When Dalton made his speech at the CCi conference in June, he was met with a series of questions about embracing amateur content available on the web, and making the archive available for "mash ups". He responded that while all that had its place, he never wanted to see a situation in which the Chris Lilleys of the world were replaced by patchy amateur content. Fair enough. But it is becoming clear that within the creative community - and within the younger people on the ABC staff - there is a head of steam behind Web 2. 0 and the possibilities for the ABC to become less of an institution and more of a "space" for its audience. This in turn goes to the heart of the nature of a lumbering institution such as the Aunty, with its many factions and internal battles. What role for professional content makers in the new media age? And what of the broader question: "Why public broadcasting"? That brings us to the charters of our public broadcasters - the oft-referred-to but rarely read holy writ with which they lay their claims on the public purse. Every time someone is cross with our public broadcasters, they ask "What about the charter"? Is the ABC not being brave enough, different enough, or is too driven by ratings? Is it too like the commercial channels, or too elitist? Is it too left wing, or not controversial enough? Spicks and Specks might be fun, but is a music game show "charter"? East of Everything might be Australian drama, but isn 2 ̆ 7 t it just Seachange revisited? Doesn 2 ̆ 7 t the charter say the ABC has to be innovative? At the 2020 summit, participants called for the charters of the ABC and SBS to be reviewed, but so far as I can determine gave no hint for why or how this might be done. The truth is that the charters of our public broadcasters are gloriously broadly worded, binding them to almost nothing, and open to interpretation by whomever is in power. This is not necessarily a bad thing in a document governing an arts organisation. Ask the judges of the Miles Franklin Award whether they wouldn?t rather Miles had allowed them to give the gong to works by Australians, without insisting that they also be works about Australia. So what do the charters say, and what do they not say, and what should they say in the new media world? The ABC Charter binds Auntie to providing "innovative and comprehensive" broadcasting services, and then goes on "without limiting the generality of the foregoing" to talk about national identity, informing and entertaining, educating and reflecting cultural diversity, as well as encouraging the arts. In doing all these things, the ABC should "take account of" services already provided by the commercials, and its responsibility to "provide a balance between broadcasting programs|$|R
