2500|$|The altar table {{comprises}} {{a smaller}} pedestal {{at the front}} of the larger pedestal and on this is a bas-relief which depicts Jesus' apparition before the empty tomb. [...] Beneath this is an inscription added by Abbé Jacquot stating that any visitor saying prayers at the calvary will be given 40 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> after saying [...] "5 Paters and 3 Ave Marias." [...] On the altar table's surface is a depiction of the entombment ("Mise au tombeau") attended by Saint Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea, John the Evangelist and three female saints. This is attributed to Guillouic. To the side of the altar there are statues of the Prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezechiel and Daniel. Each carries a banner. Isaiah's banner reads [...] "Salvabos gregem meum", Jeremiah's reads [...] "Saturabitur opprobriis", Ezechiel's reads [...] "Et cum sceleratis reputatus est" [...] and Daniel's [...] "Christus occidetur". The four sculptures are attributed to Jacquot[...]|$|E

60|$|First, Doth the Lord knock {{still at}} the door of thy heart by His Word and Spirit? If so, then the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> is not past with thy soul; for where He doth so knock, there He doth also proffer and promise to come in and sup, that is, to {{communicate}} of His things unto them, which he would not do was the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> past with his soul (Rev 3:20).|$|R

6000|$|Answ. Truly, {{with some}} men indeed it doth fare thus, that the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> {{is at an}} end before their lives are at end. Or thus, the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> is past before the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> death is come, as Christ saith, [...] "If thou hadst known, even thou, {{at least in this}} thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace," [...] that is, the word <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> or reconciliation, [...] "but now they are hid from thine eyes" [...] (Luke 19:41,42). But for the better {{satisfying}} of thee as touching this thing, consider these following things-- ...|$|R

This was the last night on which his paternal roof would shelter him, the <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> since it fell into hand having expired; and Giles was taking down his cupboards and bedsteads {{with a view to}} an early exit next morning. His encounter with Mrs. Charmond had cost him dearly.|$|E

"There is no use disguising the fact, Silas, that I grow weaker every day, and the {{numbness}} is creeping nearer and {{nearer to}} my heart," [...] said Miss Merrick, in her usual even tones. [...] "It is folly {{for me to}} trifle with these few <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> yet allowed me, and I have fully {{made up my mind}} as to the disposition of my property." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the third}} day of the seven <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> allowed him by the autocrat of the range, old man Ellison drove his buckboard to Frio City to fetch some {{necessary}} supplies for the ranch. Bradshaw was hard but not implacable. He divided the old man's order by two, and let him have a little more time. One article secured was a new, fine ham for the pleasure of the troubadour.|$|E
6000|$|... [47] [All {{bills and}} {{promissory}} notes, inland or foreign, payable in this country, are allowed three <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> beyond the actual period expressed upon them; thus, a bill drawn at thirty days after date, is payable {{only on the}} thirty-third day. If bills be not presented for payment {{on the last day}} of grace, they cannot be protested, and consitute only an evidence of the debt for legal recovery. If the last day of grace be a Sunday, the bill is presentible on the Saturday previous.] ...|$|E
6000|$|Objection. But {{some man}} may say unto me, 'Fain I would be saved, fain I would {{be saved by}} Christ; but I fear this <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> is past, and that I shall perish, {{notwithstanding}} the exceeding riches <b>of</b> the <b>grace</b> <b>of</b> God.' ...|$|R
60|$|No {{more such}} Christs! There {{will be no}} more such Christs, sinner! Oh, put not the <b>day,</b> the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace,</b> away from thee! if it be once gone, it will never come again, sinner.|$|R
6000|$|Object. But {{how should}} I know whether Christ do so knock at my heart {{as to be}} desirous to come in? That I may know also, whether the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> be past with me or no? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{facts are}} easy {{enough for you}} to prove," [...] he said, [...] "and I have here," [...] he added, {{producing}} a roll of papers, [...] "copies of the various documents for your inspection. Your scheme, of course, was simple enough. It fell through for this one reason only. A final notice, pressing for the second installment and stating the <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace,</b> was forwarded to Constantinople about the time of the recent political troubles. The late government ignored it. In fairness to Major Kosuth, we will believe that the present government was ignorant of it. But the fact remains that Messrs. Shepherd & Hargreaves became at liberty to sell those vessels, and that I have bought them. You will have to give up that money, Major Kosuth." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, in my {{handling}} of this point, I shall {{discourse of the}} cutting down, or the judgment here denounced, as it respecteth the doing of it by God's hand immediately, and that too with respect to his casting {{them out of the}} world, and not as it respecteth an act of the church, &c. And as to this cutting down, or judgment, it must be concluded, that it cannot be before the day of grace be past with the fig-tree; but according to the observation, there are some professors whose day of grace will end with, Cut it down; and according to the words of the text, 'Then,' after that, 'thou shalt cut it down.' 'After that,' that is, after all my attempts and endeavours to make it fruitful, after I have left it, given it over, done with it, and have resolved to bestow no more <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace,</b> opportunities of grace, and means of grace upon it, then, 'after that,' thou shalt cut it down.|$|E
60|$|Twenty-five {{days later}} a {{telegram}} came to Conroy's rooms: 'Notice given. Waterloo again. Twenty-fourth.' That same evening he was wakened by the shudder and the sigh that {{told him his}} sentence had gone forth. Yet he reflected on his pillow that he had, in spite of lapses, snatched something like three weeks of life, which included several rides on a horse before breakfast--the hour one most craves Najdolene; five consecutive evenings on the river at Hammersmith in a tub where he had well stretched the white arms that passing crews mocked at; a game of rackets at his club; three dinners, one small dance, and one human flirtation with a human woman. More notable still, he had settled his month's accounts, only once confusing petty cash with the <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> allowed him. Next morning he rode his hired beast in the park victoriously. He saw Miss Henschil on horse-back near Lancaster Gate, talking {{to a young man}} at the railings.|$|E
6000|$|... 66. After this, {{that other}} doubt did come with {{strength}} upon me, But how if the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> should be past and gone? How {{if you have}} overstood the time of mercy? Now I remember that one day, as I was walking in the country, I was much in the thoughts of this, But how if the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> is past? And to aggravate my trouble, the Tempter presented to my mind those good people of Bedford, and suggested thus unto me, that these being converted already, they were all that God would save in those parts; and that I came too late, for these had got the blessing before I came.|$|R
6000|$|Answer. First, Hast thou any lease of thy life? Did ever God tell thee {{thou shalt}} live half a year, or two months longer? Nay, it may be, thou mayst not live so long. And therefore, Secondly, Wilt thou be so sottish and unwise, as to venture thy soul upon a little {{uncertain}} time? Thirdly, Dost thou {{know whether the}} <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> will last a week longer or no? For the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> is past with some before their life is ended; and if it should be so with thee, wouldst thou not say, 'O that I had begun to run before the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> had been past, and the gates of heaven shut against me!' But, Fourthly, If thou shouldst see any of thy neighbors neglect the making sure of either house or land to themselves, if they had it proffered to them, saying, 'Time enough hereafter,'--when the time is uncertain; and besides, {{they do not know}} whether ever it will be proffered to them again, or no: I say, wouldst thou not call them fools? And if so, then dost thou think that thou art a wise man to let thy immortal soul hang over hell by a thread of uncertain time, which may soon be cut asunder by death? ...|$|R
60|$|Object. But surely, if the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> was not {{past with}} me, I {{should not be}} so long without an answer of God's love to my soul; that {{therefore}} doth make me mistrust my state the more is, that I wait and wait, and yet am not delivered.|$|R
60|$|But in {{bills of}} {{exchange}} or promissory notes, it is quite another thing; and he that values his reputation in trade should never let a bill come twice for payment, or a note under his hand stay a day after it is due, that is to say, after the three <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace,</b> as it is called. Those three days, indeed, are granted to all {{bills of exchange}}, not by law, but by the custom of trade: {{it is hard to}} tell how this custom prevailed, or when it began, but it is one of those many instances which may be given, where custom of trade is equal to an established law; and it is so much a law now in itself, that no bill is protested now, till those three days are expired; nor is a bill of exchange esteemed due till the third day; no man offers to demand it, nor will any goldsmith, or even the bank itself, pay a foreign bill sooner. But that by the way.|$|E
60|$|VII. That {{the third}} year, {{that is to}} say, in the year 1780, the same demand was, with the same menaces, renewed, and did, as before, produce several humble remonstrances and {{submissive}} complaints, which the said Hastings did always treat as crimes and offences of the highest order; and although in the regular subsidy or tribute, which was monthly payable by treaty, fifty <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> were allowed on each payment, and after the expiration of the said fifty days one quarter par cent only was provided as a penalty, he, the said Warren Hastings, on some short delay of payment of his third arbitrary and illegal demand, did presume of his own authority to impose a fine or mulct of ten thousand pounds on the said Rajah; and though {{it does not appear}} whether or no the same was actually levied, the said threat was soon after followed by an order from the said Hastings for the march of troops into the country of Benares, as in the preceding year.|$|E
6000|$|Of course, I had no objection. But I {{was filled}} with wonder. If {{all he wanted was}} the wood and iron, what, in the name of fortune, was to prevent him taking them? [...] "His right there was none to dispute." [...] He might lay hands on all to-morrow, as the wild cats had laid hands upon our knives and hatchet. Besides, was this mass of heavy mining plant worth transportation? If it was, why had not the {{rightful}} owners carted it away? If it was, would they not preserve their title to these movables, even after they had lost their title to the mine? And if it were not, what the better was Rufe? Nothing would grow at Silverado; there was even no wood to cut; beyond a sense of property, {{there was nothing to be}} gained. Lastly, was it at all credible that Ronalds would forget what Rufe remembered? The <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> were not yet over: any fine morning he might appear, paper in hand, and enter for another year on his inheritance. However, it was none of my business; all seemed legal; Rufe or Ronalds, all was one to me.|$|E
6000|$|Answ. 1. Hast thou any lease of thy life? Did ever God tell thee {{thou shalt}} live half a year, or two months longer? nay, {{it may be}} thou mayst not live so long. And therefore, 2. Wilt thou be so sottish and unwise, as to venture thy soul upon a little {{uncertain}} time? 3. Dost thou know whether the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> will last a week longer or no? For the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> is past with some before their life is ended: and if it should be so with thee, wouldst thou not say, O that I had begun to run before the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> had been past, and the gates of heaven shut against me. But, 4. If thou shouldst see any of thy neighbours neglect the making sure of either house or land to themselves, if they had it proffered to them, saying, Time enough hereafter, {{when the time is}} uncertain; and besides, they do not know whether ever it will be proffered to them again, or no: I say, Wouldst thou not then call them fools? And if so, then dost thou think that thou art a wise man to let thy immortal soul hang over hell by a thread of uncertain time, which may soon be cut asunder by death? ...|$|R
50|$|War did {{not come}} to the Philippines on 7 December, as it did to Pearl Harbor. Due to the International Date Line, Sunday, 7 December, {{remained}} a <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace.</b> The war between Imperial Japan and the United States, instead, began in Hawaii, by which time it was 8 December in the Philippines.|$|R
6000|$|... 3. Yet these three, {{after their}} <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> was over, lived better lives, as to outward things, than ever they did before. Cain, after this, was lord {{of a city}} (Gen 4:17). Ishmael was, after this, father of twelve princes (Gen 25:16). And Esau, after this, told his brother, 'I have enough, my brother, keep that thou hast unto thyself' (Gen 33:8,9). Ease and peace, and a prosperous life in outwards, {{is no sign of}} the favour of God to a barren and fruitless professor, but rather of his wrath; that thereby he may be capable to {{treasure}} up more wrath against the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God. Let this much serve for the proof of the first proposition, namely, That the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> ends with some men before God takes them out of the world.|$|R
60|$|We held {{our little}} house on lease; {{the owner was}} a mean, saving old man named Pettigrew, {{who lived in a}} villa adorned with plaster images of dogs and goats, at Overcastle, and in spite of our {{specific}} agreement, he would do no repairs for us at all. He rested secure in my mother's timidity. Once, long ago, she had been behind-hand with her rent, with half of her quarter's rent, and he had extended the <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> a month; her sense that some day she might need the same mercy again made her his abject slave. She was afraid even to ask that he should cause the roof to be mended for fear he might take offence. But one night the rain poured in on her bed and gave her a cold, and stained and soaked her poor old patchwork counterpane. Then she got me to compose an excessively polite letter to old Pettigrew, begging him as a favor to perform his legal obligations. It is part of the general imbecility of those days that such one-sided law as existed was a profound mystery to the common people, its provisions impossible to ascertain, its machinery impossible to set in motion. Instead of the clearly written code, the lucid statements of rules and principles that are now at the service of every one, the law was the muddle secret of the legal profession. Poor people, overworked people, had constantly to submit to petty wrongs because of the intolerable uncertainty not only of law but of cost, and of the demands upon time and energy, proceedings might make. There was indeed no justice for any one too poor to command a good solicitor's deference and loyalty; there was nothing but rough police protection and the magistrate's grudging or eccentric advice for the mass of the population. The civil law, in particular, was a mysterious upper-class weapon, and I can imagine no injustice that would have been sufficient to induce my poor old mother to appeal to it.|$|E
6000|$|... [48] [In {{consequence}} of the great extension of commerce {{since the time of}} Defoe, a short explanation of the principle and practice of drawing foreign bills of exchange now seems necessary. Foreign bills of exchange are used, {{in order to avoid the}} necessity of transmitting actual money from one country to another. A merchant, for instance, in Nova Scotia, is owing £100 to a manufacturer in Glasgow: he seeks out some one who is a creditor to that amount to some person in Britain; we shall say he finds a captain in the army who wishes to draw £100 from his agent in London. To this captain the Nova Scotia merchant pays £100, and gets his order or bill on the London agent, which bill he sends to the manufacturer in Glasgow, and the manufacturer transmits the bill to London for payment; any banker, indeed, will give him the money for it, deducting a small commission. Thus two debts are liquidated, without the transmission of a farthing in money. The demand for bills in foreign countries to send to Great Britain, has the effect of raising them to a premium, which is called the rate of exchange, and is a burden which falls on the purchaser of the bill. Foreign bills of exchange drawn on parties in Great Britain, have expressed upon them the number of days after sight at which they are to be payable. Thus, a merchant on receiving a foreign bill drawn at 'thirty days after sight,' hastens to get it 'sighted,' or shown to the party on whom it is drawn, and that party accepts it, at the same time marking the date of doing so. The bill is then complete and negociable, and is presented for payment to the acceptor at the end of the time specified, allowing the usual three <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace.</b> Should the bill not be accepted on being 'sighted,' it is a dishonoured bill, and is returned with a legal protest to the foreign correspondent. To avert, as far as possible, the loss of foreign bills by shipwreck, a set of three bills is drawn for each transaction, called first, second, and third, of the same tenor. For example: 'Thirty days after sight pay this my first bill of exchange, for the sum of £100 sterling; second and third of the same tenor being unpaid.' This first bill is first sent, and by next conveyance the second is sent. Should the first arrive safely, the second, on making its appearance, is destroyed. The third is retained by the foreign correspondent till he hear whether the former two have arrived at their destination, and is sent only if they have been lost. On receiving whichever comes first, it is the duty of the receiver to communicate intelligence of the fact to the sender.] ...|$|E

Neither as yet could I attain to any {{comfortable}} persuasion that I {{had faith}} in Christ; {{but instead of}} having satisfaction here, I began to find my soul to be assaulted with fresh doubts about my future happiness; especially with such as these, whether I was elected?

60|$|But again, this <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace,</b> and <b>of</b> {{conversion}} of sinners, {{it must be}} looked upon either as the church is in captivity and persecution, or as she is out. Now, as she is in captivity, so her longest day is usually accompanied with a black and doubtful night of temptation and affliction. Wherefore this day here being spoken of, it is the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> that she shall have even when she is absolutely delivered from the rage of the beast, false prophet, and whore. Wherefore he is not content to say, the gates shall not be shut at all by day, but adds withal, 'for there shall be no night there'; as who should say, I know that commonly in the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> the church's affliction she is accompanied with nights as well as days, but it shall not be so here; 'Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself; for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the <b>days</b> <b>of</b> thy mourning shall be ended' (Isa 60:20).|$|R
