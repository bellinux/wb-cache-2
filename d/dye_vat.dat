5000|$|Turnsole {{became a}} {{mainstay}} of medieval manuscript illuminators starting {{with the development of}} the technique for extracting it in the thirteenth century, when it joined the vegetable-based woad and indigo in the illuminator's repertory. However, the queen of blue colorants was always the expensive lapis lazuli or its substitute azurite, ground to the finest powders. According to its method of preparation, turnsole produced a range of translucent colors from blue, through purple to red, according to its reaction to the acidity or alkalinity of its environment, in the chemical reaction, not understood in the Middle Ages, that is most familiar in the Litmus test.Folium ("leaf"), was actually derived from the three-lobed fruit (illustration), not the leaves. In the early fifteenth century, Cennino Cennini, in his Libro dell' Arte gives a recipe [...] "XVIII: How you should tint paper turnsole color" [...] and [...] "LXXVI To paint a purple or turnsole drapery in fresco." [...] (though neither of these recipes use or describe turnsole). Textiles soaked in the <b>dye</b> <b>vat</b> would be left in a close damp cellar in an atmosphere produced by pans of urine.

This collection of dyes has not changed much in recent years. About 60 % of them have C. I. Numbers-i. e., ihe chemical structure of the principle color component is known; 85 % are derivatives of anthraquinone, and of these almost 50 % fall into only five chemical structure subgroups; indigo derivatives and the related thioindigo derivatives account for about 10 % of the list. As a class, <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> are expensive, although they share this characteristic with some fiber reactive dyes.

40|$|This {{research}} has been initiated to assist the fish scales entrepreneur in Malaysia into getting a consistent fish scales dye process. Several tests on colouring dyes have been conducted to establish a suitable dye with consistent measuring techniques. With the above objectives in mind, the researcher hoped to establish a colour guideline in form of colour tones thus provides a wider choice of colour selection to these entrepreneurs. John Snapper or Golden Snapper " Jenahak" from (Lutjanus johni family), Malabar Red Snapper "Merah" from (Lutjanus malabaricus family), Threadfish Bream" Kerisi" from (Nemipteridae family) and Herring or Toli Shad" Terubok" from (Clupeidae family) were the four types of salt water fish selected for their scales for this research as {{they are the most}} caught by Malaysian fishermen. In the early stage of this experiment the researcher tried to find a suitable cleaning substance and process to wash these fish scales. Three types of cleaning agent were then tested such as detergent, lime juice and bleach. Ofthe three, lime juice produced the best result. Some other experiments conducted were the crushing test, burning test, pounding test and baking test. They are to determine the durability quality of these fish scales. The fish scales were then tested for colouring suitability. Five different types of fabric dyes were selected such as disperse dye, reactive <b>dye,</b> <b>vat</b> dye, pigment dye and natural dye. Out of these five types, Cool Reactive dye from Remazol brand gave the best colour reaction on these scales. The weighing technique was then established using grams for colours and litre for measuring water. Prior to this the researcher had used a spoon for measuring the colour quantity and cups for measuring the amount of water where it produced an inconsistent colour tones. Based on the colour tones obtained from the experiments, the researcher were able to establish an array ofcolours in the form of colour codes. A colour fastness test were conducted on these coloured scales using test methods such as rubbing test, daylight test and soaking in sulphuric acid. Apart from the above discoveries, the researcher was also able to find other valuable information to be shared with. They include the size, shape, thickness and texture of the scales which were different for all the four types of fish. The resilient characteristic of the scales made it difficult to tear or crushed. However, the colour absorption on these fish scales is being influenced by its thickness. As for the recommendation, this research can be used as reference for producing wider range of handicraft products and products in form ofjewelleries or sequins. The colours can further be experimented using natural dye on other types of salt water or fresh water fish. Batik decoration techniques can be applied on a bigger size fish scales...|$|E

50|$|Protein-based fibers such as silk, wool, and feathers, {{as well as}} the {{synthetic}} polyamide fiber, nylon, can be dyed with acid dyes. As may be expected from the name, acid dyes are effective at acidic (low) pH, where they form ionic bonds with the fiber. Acid dyes are also relatively safe (some are used as food dyes) and simple to use. <b>Vat</b> <b>dyes,</b> including indigo, are a third class of dyes that are effective on cellulosic fibers and silk. <b>Vat</b> <b>dyes</b> are insoluble in water in their unreduced form, and the <b>vat</b> <b>dye</b> must be chemically reduced before they can be used to color fabric. This is accomplished by heating the dye in a strongly basic solution of sodium hydroxide (lye) or sodium carbonate (caustic potash) containing a reducing agent such as sodium hydrosulfite or thiourea dioxide. The fabric is immersed in the dye bath, and after removal the <b>vat</b> <b>dye</b> oxidizes to its insoluble form, binding with high wash-fastness to the fiber. However, <b>vat</b> <b>dyes,</b> and especially indigo, must be treated after dyeing by 'soaping' to prevent the dye from rubbing (crocking) off. <b>Vat</b> <b>dyes</b> can be used to simultaneously dye the fabric and to remove underlying fiber-reactive dye (i.e., can dye a black cotton fabric yellow) because of the bleaching action of the reducing bath (see below). The extra complexity and safety issues (particularly when using strong bases such as lye) restrict use of <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> in tie-dye to experts.|$|R

Aims and Objectives: To investigate the possible effect of occupational exposure to <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> on the functions of the liver. Materials and Methods: Using convenience sampling technique, a cohort of dye workers (n= 117) with a minimum of one year and a maximum of 60 years duration of exposure (mean = 17. 03 &#x 00 B 1; 1. 19 years) were recruited in this study. Sixty traders, matched for age and sex and who had no previous exposure to <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> were selected as controls. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain information on demographic, occupational and environmental characteristics of the subjects. Plasma activities of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and plasma concentrations of total protein, albumin and total bilirubin were measured using standard spectrophotometric methods. Statistical analyses: SPSS version 11. 0 was used for statistical analyses. Tests of significance were carried out using Student&#x 2032;s t test, and correlation co-efficient. Results and Conclusion : The activity of ALP and the concentrations of total protein and albumin were significantly lower (P &# 60; 0. 05) in the exposed group.

40|$|In textile {{chemical}} processing industries <b>vat</b> <b>dye</b> {{is one of}} the important dyes for coloration of cotton, when high fastness properties are required.
