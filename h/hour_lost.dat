Methods: Key absenteeism variables were extracted from Statistics Canada’s monthly labour force survey (LFS). Absenteeism and the proportion of <b>hours</b> <b>lost</b> due to own illness or disability were modelled as a function of trend, seasonality and proxy variables for influenza activity from 1998 to 2009. Results: <b>Hours</b> <b>lost</b> due to the H 1 N 1 / 09 pandemic strain were elevated compared to seasonal influenza, accounting for a loss of 0. 2 % of potential hours worked annually.

60|$|Catherine {{sat alone}} by the parlour fire--sat there {{for more than}} an <b>hour,</b> <b>lost</b> in her meditations. Her aunt seemed to her {{aggressive}} and foolish, and to see it so clearly--to judge Mrs. Penniman so positively--made her feel old and grave. She did not resent the imputation of weakness; it made no impression on her, for she had not the sense of weakness, and she was not hurt at not being appreciated. She had an immense respect for her father, and she felt that to displease him would be a misdemeanour analogous to an act of profanity in a great temple; but her purpose had slowly ripened, and she believed that her prayers had purified it of its violence. The evening advanced, and the lamp burned dim without her noticing it; her eyes were fixed upon her terrible plan. She knew her father was in his study--that he had been there all the evening; from time to time she expected to hear him move. She thought he would perhaps come, as he sometimes came, into the parlour. At last the clock struck eleven, and the house was wrapped in silence; the servants had gone to bed. Catherine got up and went slowly {{to the door of the}} library, where she waited a moment, motionless. Then she knocked, and then she waited again. Her father had answered her, but she had not the courage to turn the latch. What she had said to her aunt was true enough--she was afraid of him; and in saying that she had no sense of weakness she meant that she was not afraid of herself. She heard him move within, and he came and opened the door for her.|$|E
60|$|It {{produced}} in me, this figure, {{in the clear}} twilight, I remember, two distinct gasps of emotion, which were, sharply, the shock of my first and that of my second surprise. My second was a violent perception of the mistake of my first: the man who met my eyes was not the person I had precipitately supposed. There came to me thus a bewilderment of vision of which, after these years, there is no living view that I can hope to give. An unknown man in a lonely place is a permitted object of fear to a young woman privately bred; and the figure that faced me was--a few more seconds assured me--as little anyone else I knew {{as it was the}} image that had been in my mind. I had not seen it in Harley Street--I had not seen it anywhere. The place, moreover, in the strangest way in the world, had, on the instant, and by the very fact of its appearance, become a solitude. To me at least, making my statement here with a deliberation with which I have never made it, the whole feeling of the moment returns. It was as if, while I took in--what I did take in--all the rest of the scene had been stricken with death. I can hear again, as I write, the intense hush in which the sounds of evening dropped. The rooks stopped cawing in the golden sky, and the friendly <b>hour</b> <b>lost,</b> for the minute, all its voice. But there was no other change in nature, unless indeed it were a change that I saw with a stranger sharpness. The gold was still in the sky, the clearness in the air, and the man who looked at me over the battlements was as definite as a picture in a frame. That's how I thought, with extraordinary quickness, of each person that he might have been and that he was not. We were confronted across our distance quite long enough for me to ask myself with intensity who then he was and to feel, as an effect of my inability to say, a wonder that in a few instants more became intense.|$|E

40|$|Aedes albopictus is {{the most}} {{invasive}} mosquito in the world, an important disease vector, and a biting nuisance that limits outdoor activities. Area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) is the recommended control strategy. We conducted an economic evaluation of the AW-IPM project in Mercer and Monmouth Counties, New Jersey with a controlled design (AW-IPM vs. control) from 2009 through 2011. The study analyzed financial documents and staff time for AW-IPM and surveyed an average of 415 randomly chosen households in AW-IPM and control areas each fall from 2008 through 2011. <b>Hours</b> <b>lost</b> from yard and porch activities were calculated as differences between actual and potential hours of these activities in an average summer week {{if there had been}} no mosquito concerns. Net estimated benefits of AW-IPM were based on cross-over and difference-in-difference analyses. Reductions in <b>hours</b> <b>lost</b> were valued based on respondents' willingness to pay for a hypothetical extra hour free of mosquitoes spent on yard or porch activities and literature on valuation of a quality adjusted life year (QALY). The incremental cost of AW-IPM per adult was $ 41. 18 per year. Number of <b>hours</b> <b>lost</b> due to mosquitoes in AW-IPM areas between the base year (2008) and the intervention years (2009 - 2011) declined by 3. 30 hours per summer week in AW-IPM areas compared to control areas. Survey respondents valued this improvement at $ 27. 37 per adult per summer week. Over the 13 -week summer, an average adult resident gained 42. 96 hours of yard and porch time, worth $ 355. 82. The net benefit over the summer was $ 314. 63. With an average of 0. 0027 QALYs gained per adult per year, AW-IPM was cost effective at $ 15, 300 per QALY gained.

Among other things, critics point out that every hour spent assessing students is an <b>hour</b> <b>lost</b> from instruction. But, does it have to be? What if we better integrated assessment into classroom instruction and allowed students to learn during the test? We developed an approach that provides immediate tutoring on practice assessment items that students cannot solve on their own. Our hypothesis is that we can achieve more accurate assessment by not only using data on whether students get test items right or wrong, but by also using data on the effort required for students to solve a test item with instructional assistance. We have integrated assistance and assessment in the ASSISTment system. The system helps teachers make better use of their time by offering instruction to students while providing a more detailed evaluation of student abilities to the teachers, which is impossible under current approaches. Our approach for assessing student math proficiency is to use data that our system collects through its interactions with students to estimate their performance on an end-of-year high stakes state test.

30|$|According to Table  4, {{the direct}} {{budgetary}} costs of short-time work in Luxembourg rose from € 16 per <b>hour</b> <b>lost</b> in 2009 to € 18.2 in 2013. This {{implies that the}} average cost of one job saved increased from approximately € 2900 per month in 2009 to € 5500 in 2013. From a government perspective, the direct benefit of STW consists of lower payments of unemployment benefits to those who would have lost their job otherwise. As discussed earlier, the situation of Luxembourg is specific because about half of the labour force are cross-border workers. If they lose their employment in Luxembourg, their unemployment benefits are paid by their respective country of residence. At the same time, during the Great Recession cross-border workers were more severely affected by job losses. This impedes us from precisely calculating the budgetary costs of paying unemployment benefits to people having been laid off in the absence of STW availability. As an approximation and an upper bound, we assume that one half of the employees that would have lost their job in the absence of STWA would have received unemployment benefits in Luxembourg (i.e. we consider the share of cross-border workers in the private sector employment in Luxembourg and assume that resident and cross-border workers have the same likelihood of being involved in STW and losing their job in its absence). Focusing on the peak period of STW use in 2009, this would imply approximately additional 870 unemployed and annual budgetary cost of € 27.6 million. Hence, from a pure Luxembourg perspective, the rough approximation of benefits of the STW programme lie below its direct costs. If we include in the approximation the budgetary costs of the cross-border workers saved through STW in Luxembourg, we would arrive at a figure that is closer but still below the direct costs of the STW programme. The benefit of STW in terms or lower budget costs related to otherwise higher unemployment only applies as long as the people remain unemployed. A more sophisticated cost–benefit analysis would {{have to take into account}} not only the average duration of unemployment spells but also consider social costs of unemployment such as the deterioration of human capital during unemployment, long-term unemployment etc.|$|E
