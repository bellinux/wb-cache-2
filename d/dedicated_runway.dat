50|$|On June 16, 1930 the Evansville Municipal Airport was <b>dedicated.</b> The <b>runways,</b> 100 X 1,200 {{feet and}} four inches thick, cost $30,000. The first Evansville Airport Manager was Werner J. Genot, who took charge on December 16, 1930.|$|R
50|$|Tangier Island was {{purchased}} with two overcoats in 1666. In 1969 land was <b>dedicated</b> for a <b>runway.</b> A medical clinic {{on the island}} is named after Dr. David Nichols who flew in to perform medical care from 1979 to 2010.|$|R
5000|$|Houston Metro Airlines (later renamed as Metro Airlines) {{operated}} Twin Otters in scheduled [...] "cross-town" [...] {{air service}} between the Clear Lake City STOLport (CLC) in Clear Lake City, Texas and Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH, now Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport) {{which had a}} <b>dedicated</b> STOL <b>runway</b> at the time. According to the February 1976 edition of the Official Airline Guide (OAG), the airline was operating 22 roundtrip flights every weekday between CLC and IAH in a passenger shuttle service.|$|R

50|$|Built {{at a cost}} of {{approximately}} RM4 billion (US$1.3 billion), klia2 is the world's largest purpose-built terminal dedicated to low-cost carriers and is designed to cater for 45 million passengers a year with future capacity expansion capability. The terminal is served by a <b>dedicated</b> 4 km <b>runway</b> (KLIA's Runway 3) and a 141.3m air traffic control (ATC) tower, making it the world's tallest ATC tower.|$|R
50|$|Early {{media reports}} during September 2011 {{suggested}} {{that there could be}} up to 9 runways: 8 runways for civil aviation plus one <b>runway</b> <b>dedicated</b> to military usage. It would replace Beijing Capital International Airport (which had 83 million passengers in 2013, second most in the world) as the main airport of Beijing and the largest in China and was being planned as a domestic-only airport. The airport was planned {{to be able to handle}} 120 to 200 million passengers a year, which, if capacity were fully used, would make it the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic, surpassing Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.|$|R

40|$|Increased {{efficiency}} {{at airports}} {{is necessary to}} reduce delays and fuel consumption. Many of the busiest airports in the nation {{have at least one}} pair of closely spaced parallel runways (CSPRs), defined by a separation of less than 2500 ft, with one <b>runway</b> <b>dedicated</b> to arrivals and the other to departures. CSPRs experience a large decrease in capacity under instrument conditions because they can no longer operate independently. In order to mitigate this decrease in capacity and to increase efficiency, proposed herein is a departure regulator for runways so configured, along with a plan of study to investigate the effects of this regulator. The proposed departure regulator makes use of data from precision tracking systems such as ADS-B to issue automated or semi-automated departure clearances. Assuming sequential departure separations are sufficient for clearance, the regulator will automatically issue, or advise the controller to issue, the departure clearance as soon as the arrival on the adjacent runway has descended below its decision height. By issuing the departure clearance earlier, the departure regulator reduces the gap between a pair of arrivals that is required to clear a departure. By decreasing the gap, the regulator increases the number of opportunities where a departure clearance can be issued, given a particular arrival stream. A simulation models the effects of the regulator and quantifies the resulting increases in capacity. The simulation results indicate that all forms of the regulator would provide significant gains of between 14 % and 23 % in capacity over the current operating paradigm. The results also indicate that the capacity gains are greatest at high arrival rates. Therefore, implementation of the departure regulator could significantly decrease the congestion at many major airports during inclement weather.
