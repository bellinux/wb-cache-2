We reprocess three vibroseis seismic profiles (acquired in the early 1980 s for hydrocarbon explo- ration) whose stacked sections were optimized for relatively deep oil targets. On the reprocessed seismic profile closest to the epicentral area, we construct the main reflectors {{to a depth of}} about 4 s (two-way time) and compare this interpretation with the available hypocenters of the 1997 earthquakes. The improvements in visualizing the shallow and deep reflections provide a better correlation between the re- <b>flectors</b> and the observed surface structures as well as a better delineation of the basement-rock geometry. We find that part of the Colfiorito sequence is localized around some of the reflectors in the reflection profile, which we interpret as related to the active normal faults that outcrop at the surface...|$|R
40|$|Deep seismic {{profiling}} {{was performed}} in the Kanto and Kinki areas to obtain a better estimation of strong ground motions. In the Kanto area, we identify the seismogenic source fault on the upper surface of the Philippine Sea plate. The depth {{to the top of}} this plate, 4 to 26 km, is much shallower than previously estimated from the distribution of seismicity. This shallower plate geometry changes the location of the maximum finite slip of the 1923 Kanto earthquake, and its location corresponds to a zone of poor reflection on the mega-thrust, namely, a strong reflectivity zone along the mega-thrust coincidences with aseismic slip zone. In the Kinki area, 120 -km-long seismic reflection profiling was carried out from Osaka to Suzuka across the Osaka and Ise basins and several active faults. Deep sub-horizontal reflectors are found at 26 and 16 km in depth. The shallower re <b>flectors</b> correspond {{to the base of the}} seismogenic zone.

40|$|The {{uncertainty}} of electronic distance measurement to surfaces {{rather than to}} dedicated precisionre <b>flectors</b> (reflectorless EDM) is afected by the entire system comprising instrument, atmosphere and surface. The impact of the latter is significant for applications like geodetic monitoring, high-precision surface modelling or laser scanner self-calibration. Nevertheless, {{it has not yet}} received sufficient attention and is not well understood. We have carried out an experimental investigation of the impact of surface reflectivity on the distance measurements of a terrestrial laser scanner. The investigation helps to clarify (i) whether variations of reflectivity cause systematic deviations of reflectorless EDM, and (ii) if so, whether it is possible and worth modelling these deviations. The results show that differences in reflectivity may actually cause systematic deviations of a few mm with diffusely re- flecting surfaces and even more with directionally reflecting ones. Using abivariate quadratic polynomial we were able to approximate these deviations as a function of measured distance and measured signal strength alone. Using this approximation to predict corrections, the deviations of the measurements could be reduced by about 70 % in our experiment. We conclude that there is a systematic effect of surface reflectivity (or equivalently received signal strength) on the distance measurement and {{that it is possible to}} model and predict this effect. Integration into laser scanner calibration models may be beneficial for high precision applications. The results may apply to a broad range of instruments, not only to the specific laser scanner used herei...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis {{contribution}} {{reports on}} the results of measurements of near- and sub-barrier fusion cross sections in the system 30 Si+ 30 Si performed at the Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro of INFN. The 30 Si beam of the XTU Tandem accelerator in the energy range of 47 - 90 MeV, was delivered on a metallic 30 Si target (50 µg/cm 2) enriched to 99. 64 % in mass 30. A beam electrostatic de- <b>flector</b> was used for the detection of evaporation residues. The excitation function obtained for 30 Si+ 30 Si has been compared with the previous data on 28 Si+ 28 Si and Coupled Channels (CC) calculations using the M 3 Y+repulsion potential, taking into account the low lying 2 + and 3 − excitations. Reproducing the low-energy 28 Si+ 28 Si excitation function was only possible by using a weak imaginary potential, probably simulating the oblate deformation of this nucleus. On the contrary, the data on 30 Si+ 30 Si are nicely reproduced by the CC calculations without any imaginary potential (30 Si has a spherical shape). The astrophysical S-factor does not show a maximum, so that there is no evidence for hindrance in the measured energy range. The logarithmic derivative of the two excitation functions highlights {{the difference between the two}} systems. Even above the barrier the two systems behave differently. This is best seen by comparing the two barrier distributions where the high energy peak observed for 28 Si+ 28 Si is not found for 30 Si+ 30 Si. This is presumably due to the stronger couplings present in 28 Si and further theoretical analyses are in progress...|$|E
40|$|Surveying of {{deformations}} and movements, {{which means}} measuring of processes and ana- lyzing of observations, today requires interdisciplinary work of experts from different disci- plines. The advantage of geodetic procedures in surveying of deformations and movements is their definition {{in space and}} time. In the case of deformations and movements regar- ded as kinematic, Kalman filter {{can be used for}} the processing of kinematic terrestrial observations. For the PhD thesis the concrete measurements of the kinematic process have been performed. Measurements were made {{with one of the most}} modern electronic tacheometers capable of automatic tracking of a moving reflector. Kinematic process was carried out based on the motion of the trolley with a reflector moving along a straight trajectory, given in a local coordinate system. To capture measurements a software was prepared to establish communication with the instrument, to automatically track the re- <b>flector</b> and to acquire and store the measurements. For the processing of measurements the discrete Wiener process acceleration model was used, with prior application of the law of propagation of variances and covariances. The dissertation focuses on the statistical evaluation of the developed model, which allows us to detect the presence of gross errors in measurements and provides adequacy of the given input values. Originality of the thesis is represented by independent control of mathematical stochastic model reliability based on an independent reference trajectory. The advantage of the reference trajectory is the possibility of simultaneous evaluation of the model and capabilities of the instrument. The contribution of the work is in giving several demands that need extra attention in the case of kinematic geodetic terrestrial processes...|$|E

Afterwards, we contrast results obtained under the Spanish regulation with those obtained under other rules. A numerical analysis is done parallely on two rectangular sections, one plane (axb) and the other being edgeways (bxa). Both have the same dimensions and are under the action of the same bending moment. Finally, the formulations previously stated are applied to a floor concrete wrought; we study different types of resistance on the concrete with three armed solutions for each case, we compare results obtained, and this leads to some curious conclusions.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Engineering Sciences (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The build–up of 6 Li and 3 He, that is, {{the strong}} thermal neutron {{absorbers}} or {{the so called}} "neutron poisons", in the beryllium reflector changes the physical characteristics of the reactor, such as reactivity, neutron spectra, neutron flux level, power distribution, etc.; furthermore,gaseous isotopes such as 3 H and 4 He induce swelling and embrittlement of the reflector. The SAFARI– 1 research reactor, operated by Necsa at Pelindaba in South Africa, uses a beryllium reflector on three sides of the core, consisting of 19 beryllium reflector elements in total. This MTR went critical in 1965, and the original beryllium reflectors are still used. The individual neutron irradiation history of each beryllium reflector element, {{as well as the}} impact of beryllium poisoning on reactor parameters, were never well known nor investigated before. Furthermore, in the OSCAR{ 3 code system used in predictive neutronic calculations for SAFARI– 1, beryllium reflector burn–up is not accounted for; OSCAR models the beryllium reflector as a non–burnable, 100 % pure material. As a result, the poisoning phenomenon is not accounted for. Furthermore, the criteria and hence the optimum replacement time of the reflector has never been developed. This study presents detailed calculations, using MCNP, FISPACT and the OSCAR{ 3 code system, to quantify the influence of impurities that were originally present in the fresh beryllium reflector, the beryllium reflector poisoning phenomenon, and further goes on to propose the reflector's replacement criteria based on the calculated fluence and predicted swelling. Comparisons to experimental low power flux measurements and effects of safety parameters are also established. The study concludes that, to improve the accuracy and reliability of the predictive OSCAR code calculations, beryllium re <b>flector</b> burn–up should undoubtedly be incorporated in the next releases of OSCAR. Based on this study, the inclusion of the beryllium reflector burn–up chains is planned for implementation in the currently tested OSCAR– 4 code system. In addition to beryllium reflector poisoning, the replacement criteria of the reflector is developed. It is however crucial that experimental measurements on the contents of 3 H and 4 He be conducted and thus swelling of the reflector be quantifed. In this way the calculated results could be verified and a sound replacement criteria be developed. In the absence of experimental measurements on the beryllium reflector, the analysis and quantifcation of the calculated results is reserved for future studies. Master...|$|E
40|$|Special {{methods for}} tracing rays through re- form $J(Q, x 2, x 3) =O. This {{equation}} {{may be a}} stricted earth models are reported in the litera- simple linear equation for a plane dipping re-ture. For example, Sattlegger (1965) has dealt <b>flector,</b> a higher-order polynomial equation, or any with a two-dimensional model consisting of a se- one of the spline functions representing more com-quence of constant-velocity layers separated by plex surfaces. We shall illustrate our calculations interfaces that may be dipping. More recently, for a quadratic surface of the following type: Sorrells et al (1971) have considered three-dimen- 2 2 sional (3 D) models with plane interfaces of arbi- arrxT + a 22 x 2 + a 33 x 3 + 2 al 2 xlx 2 + % 3 x,x 3 trary strike and dip and with spherical surfaces of a special kind. In the earlier part of 1970, we were using a more general algorithm which al-lowed us to trace rays through a 3 D model con-sisting of plane or curved surfaces of arbitrary nature. This algorithm was presented by the author at the 41 st Annual SEG convention in November, 1971. A number of inquiries received by us since that time has encouraged us to sum-marize our results in this brief note. Let (Xi, X 2, X,) be a fixed, right-handed Car-tesian coordinate system to which all surfaces and raypaths will be referred. Let us assume that we know the coordinates of a point S (s,, ~ 2, SJ and the direction cosines (il, it, is) of a unit ray vector I emerging from S (Figure 1). S can be either a source or a point on a previous reflector to which the ray has been traced. The aim is to trace a ray from S to a point P (p,, p 2, p 3) on the next re-flector; i. e., to find the coordinates of P, the length, and therefore the traveltime, from S to P, and the direction cosines of a ray (reflected or re-fracted) emerging from P {{so that we can}} repeat the procedure. + 2 a 23 x 2 x 3 + blxl + b,x:! + bsx 3 + c = 0.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of high-resolution watergun seismic profiles collected {{in support of}} DSDP Leg 85 drilling reveals sev eral major, regionally traceable reflectors that can be correlated over more than 360, 000 km 2 in the central equatorial Pacific. Synthetic seismograms generated from shipboard physical property measurements (carefully corrected to in situ values) for DSDP Site 574 show excellent agreement with the field records; the agreement suggests that the traveltime to-depth conversion is accurate and permits the precise (± 5 m) location of reflectors in the cored section. The reflectors can be dated (± 0. 5 Ma) as follows: Orange, 21. 5 to 22. 5 Ma; Yellow, 20. 5 to 21. 5 Ma; Lavender, 16 to 17 Ma; Red, 13. 5 to 14. 5 Ma; Purple, 11 to 12 Ma; Brown, 7 to 8 Ma; and Green, 3 to 4 Ma. Similar analyses at the other Leg 85 sites result in identical ages. The reflectors are thus time surfaces; this chapter relates them to major paleoceanographic events {{and changes in the}} relative sea-level curve. The Orange and Yellow reflectors are associated with a marked increase in δ 1 3 C, a major change in planktonic foraminiferal assemblages, the development of the deep Circum-Antarctic Current, and the establishment of steep thermal gradients between tropical and polar regions. This reorganization of the oceanic circulation system was probably a response to the opening of the Drake Passage, and it resulted in changes in the chemistry of tropical Pacific waters that caused the induration (and thus impedance contrasts) associated with these reflectors. The Lavender reflector is associated with a large carbonate minimum, the 2 ̆ 2 Chron 16 carbon shift, 2 ̆ 2 a widespread hiatus (NH 2), major eustatic sea-level fluctuations, and a significant increase in silica deposition in the Pacific. It is not associated with 18 O enrichment or climatic cooling. We conclude that this event represents an intensification in Antarc tic Bottom Water (AABW) circulation and the partitioning of silica between the Atlantic and the Pacific, caused by the introduction of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) in response to paleobathymetric and tectonic events. The Red re <b>flector</b> is associated with a subdued carbonate minimum, a widespread hiatus (NH 3), a sea-level drop, significant changes in microfossil assemblages, and a major increase in δ 1 8 that has been linked with the buildup of Antarctic ice. Detailed isotopic analyses reveal that this isotopic shift occurred within an interval of 30, 000 yr. and precisely at the depth of the Red reflector. The Purple reflector is associated with an extremely large carbonate minimum, a change in the style of carbonate deposition in the Pacific, a major lithologic boundary, a widespread hiatus (NH 4), an increase in the provincialism be tween low and high latitudes in all planktonic microfossil assemblages, an apparent fall in eustatic sea level, an enrich ment in δ 1 8, and a major North Atlantic reflector interpreted as representing an intensification of North Atlantic bot tom-water circulation. The Brown reflector is roughly associated with a small carbonate minimum, an enrichment in δ 1 8, the late Miocene 1 3 C depletion, a drop in the relative sea-level curve, and major faunal changes. The Green reflector is associated with a large carbonate minimum, an enrichment in δ 1 8, a major western North Atlantic erosional event, and a widespread eastern Atlantic seismic reflector. The bulk of evidence supports correlation with the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation, but detailed isotopic analyses indicate that this isotopic event may be linked to the establishment of colder bottom waters without major ice-sheet development. Several types of reflectors have been identified. The reflectors in the older section result from diagenetic effects; the regionally correctable reflectors are associated with global events. In the younger (post- 18 Ma) section, local reflectors are characterized by velocity contrasts, whereas regional reflectors are associated with density contrasts caused by car bonate minima. Two modes of generation of carbonate minima (and thus of reflectors) spanning the equatorial Pacific are (1) the intensification of AABW without the concurrent intensification of NADW and so without fractionation of silica between the Atlantic and the Pacific; this mode results in the less extreme carbonate minima; and (2) the intensifi cation of AABW in response to the intensification of NADW; this mode results in extreme carbonate minima and a cor relation of equatorial Pacific reflectors with North Atlantic events...|$|E
