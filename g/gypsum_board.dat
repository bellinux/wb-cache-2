5|$|As Stone & Webster {{began work}} on the {{production}} facilities, {{it became clear that}} building the township as well would be beyond its capacity. The Army therefore engaged the architectural and engineering firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill to design and build the township. The John B. Pierce Foundation were brought in as a consultant. In turn, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill brought in numerous subcontractors. This first phase of construction became known as the East Town. It included some 3,000 family dwellings, an administrative center, three shopping centers, three grade schools for 500 children each and a high school for 500, recreation buildings, men's and women's dormitories, cafeterias, a medical services building and a 50-bed hospital. The emphasis was on speed of construction and getting around wartime shortages of materials. Where possible, fiberboard and <b>gypsum</b> <b>board</b> were used instead of wood, and foundations were made from concrete blocks rather than poured concrete. The work was completed in early 1944.|$|E
5|$|Rents {{were set}} {{based on the}} income of the occupant. Transient {{visitors}} to Los Alamos were accommodated in the Fuller Lodge, the Guest Cottage or the Big House, which had once {{been part of the}} Los Alamos Ranch School. A school was established in 1943, catering for both grade school and high school, and 140 children were enrolled; 350 by 1946. Education was free, as was a nursery school for working mothers. With 18 grade-school teachers, 13 high-school teachers, and a superintendent, it enjoyed an excellent teacher:pupil ratio. Numerous technical buildings were constructed. Most were of a semi-permanent type, using <b>gypsum</b> <b>board.</b> They were heated from a central heating plant. Initially this was Boiler House No. 1, which had two coal-fired boilers. This was replaced by Boiler House No. 2, which had six oil-fired boilers. In addition to the main site at Los Alamos, some 25 outlying sites were developed for experimental work.|$|E

30|$|Available data on thermo-mechanical {{properties}} of <b>gypsum</b> <b>boards</b> is commonly derived from research on lightweight wood construction. Thermal properties (i.e. specific heat, thermal conductivity, contraction and mass loss) of types X, C, F and R <b>gypsum</b> <b>boards</b> {{are available in}} the literature (Bakhtiary et al.

Variability in the chemical composition and testing conditions (e.g. heating rate) of gypsum leads to scattered thermal properties results (Wakili and Hugi [2009]). However, the chemical composition of the tested <b>gypsum</b> <b>boards</b> is not commonly stated in experimental reports. Modified thermal properties to implicitly account for mass transfer (e.g. water migration and re-condensation) and ablation process have also been proposed (Ang and Wang [2004]; Rahmanian [2011]).|$|R

Using measured thermal properties as functions of temperature, in combination with models taking into account radiation and convection in the wall cavity as well as mass transfer inside the <b>gypsum</b> <b>boards</b> led to a fairly good reproduction of the measured data. The fire tests were stopped immediately after the exposed gypsum layer showed ablation, which happened shortly after 60 min of exposition. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Clay and earthen {{materials}} are highly hygroscopic and thus able to effectively adsorb and release moisture from their surroundings.

A numerical hygrothermal model is introduced and validated using a set of measured data according to IEA Annex 41. The model is then {{used to determine the}} stabilization effect of rammed earth in a residential room with defined moisture sources and ventilation rate. The simulation is performed for <b>gypsum</b> <b>boards,</b> concrete and red brick as well and a clear comparison is made.

40|$|Laboratory {{measurements}} {{were made of}} the sound insulations and absorption coefficients {{of a range of}} metal-framed partitions having built-in acoustic treatment.

For the double leaf partition having built-in acoustic treatment, the sound insulations were, on average, 8 dB higher than those of the comparable partitions containing mineral wool. The use of the new double and triple leaf partitions containing built-in acoustic treatment should result in similar savings of floor areas to those obtained by using the partitions containing mineral wool as built-in acoustic treatment.

40|$|In {{this study}} both hemi-hydrate and {{anhydrite}} are tested as calcium sulphate binders for structural mortar and concrete. The advantage of using calcium sulphates instead of cement as a binder {{is the fact}} that the production of calcium sulphate is more environmental friendly than that of cement. For the calcinations of Portland cement, temperatures up to 1480 °C are needed, while the calcination of for instance hem-hydrate requires a temperature of 170 °C. The global cement industry produces around 1. 4 billion tons of C 02 per year. This is about 6 % ofthe total CO 2 production and thus it has a significant influence on the global warming of the earth / 1 /. Partially replacing cement by calcium sulphate binder could be one way to decrease the C 02 production. Applying new methods on gypsum based concrete could result in a type of concrete with a compressive strength up to 30 N/mm 2. With the right physical properties like flow ability and segregation resistance this could even be self compacting gypsum concrete (SCGC). Downside of the material is that, unprotected, it can only be used indoors, since it is non water-resistant. The calcium sulphate based concrete that has a compressive strength around 30 N/mm 2 can have different potentials of appliance. First of all it could replace cement based concretes where low to medium compressive strengths are required. Another application could be <b>gypsum</b> <b>boards.</b> These <b>gypsum</b> <b>boards</b> may be a good alternative for the use of drywall. The <b>gypsum</b> <b>boards</b> are stronger and can be self supporting, while dry wall has to be supported by a steel frame or wall. When the right aggregates and fillers are used these <b>gypsum</b> <b>boards</b> could even be produced at a lower cost than the dry wall, since the hemi-hydrate can be partially replaced by cheaper materials like sand and gravel. In this study first attempts to develop a competitive concrete based on gypsum are reported. This development follows new mix design methods, based on PSD optimization and oxide balancing, in order to reduce the free water in the hardened gypsum concrete.

One the most concerned fields, in part by a growing law framework and by the quality expectations of the clients, is architecture.

On the other hand, the environmental awareness has increased the attention towards recycled materials. In the case of composite materials, major attention has been devoted to the substitution of mineral reinforcements, such as glass fibers, by more sustainable reinforcements, as wood fibers or agroforestry wastes. In this sense, olive stones, which are a byproduct of olive oil extraction, could be used. In the present work, olive stone filled polypropylene composites were prepared.
