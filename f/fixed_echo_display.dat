In the Introduction, a historical overview is given of the history of SMS excitation in MRI. The following section on RF pulses gives both the theoretical background and practical application. The section on encoding and reconstruction shows how the collapsed multislice images can be disentangled by means of the transmitter pulse phase, gradient pulses, and most importantly using multichannel receiver coils. The relationship between classic parallel imaging techniques and SMS reconstruction methods is explored. The subsequent section describes the practical implementation, including the acquisition of reference data, and slice cross-talk.

Methods: ECHO and THRIVE were phase 3, randomized, double-blind trials. Patients received rilpivirine 25 mg once daily (qd) or efavirenz 600 mg qd, with a <b>fixed</b> (<b>ECHO)</b> or investigator-chosen (THRIVE) nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (N[t]RTI) background regimen. Response rate (the percentage {{of patients with}} VL < 50 copies/mL, using an intent-to-treat-population, time-to-loss-of-virological-response algorithm), virological failure (VF), resistance development, safety and tolerability were evaluated. Results: Baseline characteristics were comparable between the rilpivirine (n= 368) and efavirenz (n= 329) groups. At week 96, response rates [84 % for rilpivirine vs. 80 % for efavirenz; difference 4. 0 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) - 1. 7 % to 9. 7 %] and incidences of VF for the resistance analysis (VFres) (8 % for rilpivirine vs. 6 % for efavirenz; P= 0. 46) were similar in the two groups. Among patients with VFres, a comparable proportion in each group developed nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance-associated mutations (RAMs). Among those with VFres, more patients in the rilpivirine group than in the efavirenz group developed N[t]RTI RAMs, mostly M 184 I/V. The mean (95 % CI) CD 4 cell count increased from baseline to week 96 by 224 (208 - 240) cells/μL in the rilpivirine group and by 206 (188 - 225) cells/μL in the efavirenz group. Treatment-related grade 2 - 4 overall adverse events, any rash and dizziness were less frequent for rilpivirine than for efavirenz (P< 0. 0001). Conclusions: Rilpivirine demonstrated antiviral efficacy {{similar to that of}} efavirenz in antiretroviral treatment-naïve adults with baseline VL ≤ 100000 copies/mL over 96 weeks.

The ARMA signal model facilitated a rapid calculation of the chemical shift, apparent spin-spin relaxation time (T 2 *), and complex amplitudes of a multipeak system from a limited number of echoes (≤ 16). Numerical simulations of one- and two-peak systems were used to assess the accuracy and uncertainty in the calculated spectral parameters as a function of acquisition and tissue parameters. The measured uncertainties from simulation were compared to the theoretical Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the acquisition. Measurements made in phantoms were used to validate the T 2 * estimates and to validate uncertainty estimates made from the CRLB. We demonstrated application to real-time MR-guided interventions ex vivo by using the technique to monitor a percutaneous ethanol injection into a bovine liver and in vivo to monitor a laser-induced thermal therapy treatment in a canine brain. Simulation results showed that the chemical shift and amplitude uncertainties reached their respective CRLB at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ≥ 5 for echo train lengths (ETLs) ≥ 4 using a <b>fixed</b> <b>echo</b> spacing of 3. 3 ms. T 2 * estimates from the signal model possessed higher uncertainties but reached the CRLB at larger SNRs and∕or ETLs. Highly accurate estimates for the chemical shift (< 0. 01 ppm) and amplitude (< 1. 0 %) were obtained with ≥ 4 echoes and for T 2 * (< 1. 0 %) with ≥ 7 echoes. We conclude that, over a reasonable range of SNR, the SM algorithm is a robust estimator of spectral parameters from fast CSI acquisitions that acquire ≤ 16 echoes for one- and two-peak systems. Preliminary ex vivo and in vivo experiments corroborated the results from simulation experiments and further indicate the potential of this technique for MR-guided interventional procedures with high spatiotemporal resolution ∼ 1. 6 × 1. 6 × 4 mm 3 in ≤ 5 s...|$|R

We used ANIMO to generate a computational model of articular cartilage. Materials and methods: Based on a largescale literature study [3] and our own experiments, we developed ECHO (Executable Chondrocyte), a computational model of the key processes that regulate expression and activity of SOX 9 and RUNX 2, two master transcriptional regulators of the chondrocyte phenotype. ECHO consists of 93 nodes with 274 interactions that describe the expression and activity of 52 genes and proteins. Simulations in ECHO were performed to investigate the robustness of the chondrocyte network. To validate ECHO predictions, we used FRAP to measure mobility of SOX 9 and RUNX 2, which we have {{shown to be a}} faithful readout of their activity. Results: In its unperturbed form, <b>ECHO</b> <b>displays</b> two stable states in which activities of SOX 9 and RUNX 2 are mutually exclusive. SOX 9 rep resents a stable articular cartilage phenotype, while RUNX 2 represents transient hypertrophic cartilage. We tested in silico the hypothesis that addition of WNT (performed with a few clicks of the mouse) will change permanent cartilage into transient cartilage by inducing hyper trophy. Indeed, when we add WNT, a known regulator of bone forma tion, the permanent or SOX 9 + state changes to a transient or RUNX 2 + state in the model. However, it is known that healthy articular cartilage is resistant to hypertrophic differentiation. Our group has previously shown experimentally that this was probably due to the secretion of DKK 1, FRZB and GREM 1 [4, 5]. We therefore added nodes to ECHO representing DKK 1, FRZB and GREM 1 (fig. 1). GREM 1 and DKK 1 are able to stabilize the permanent cartilage or SOX 9 + state even after addition of WNT in ECHO. We observed that in our model activation of WNT leads to a switch from a SOX 9 + state to a RUNX 2 + state.

The marginally significant effect of HP can be interpreted such that each increase of one point in HP resulted in 33 % lower odds of scoring high on negative affect, factoring in the effect of engaging in physical activity. All odds ratios and coefficients can be found in Table  4. Despite non-significant random variability in a level 1 parameter (e.g., slope), level 2 predictors may be added to a model and interpreted with caution provided there be theoretical justification for their inclusion (Luke, 2004).

However, even when strong direct path pulses and nearby <b>fixed</b> clutter <b>echoes</b> are removed there are still undetected weaker aircraft echoes present which can corrupt the data. In a previous paper we presented an algorithm to improve real-time echo blanking by forming a Kalman filter tracker to follow {{the path of a}} sequence of echoes observed on successive radar antenna sweeps. The tracker builds a history which can be used to predict the location of upcoming echoes. We now present details of a new Bayesian detection algorithm which uses this prediction information to enable more sensitive weak pulse acquisition. The developed track information is used to form a spatial prior probability distribution for the presence of the next echoes. Regions with higher probability are processed with a lower detection threshold to pull out low level pulses without increasing the overall probability of false alarm detection. The ultimate result is more complete removal, by blanking the detected pulse, of radar corruption in astronomical observations.

[...] "Placebo Effect" [...] addresses the use of placebos in medicine, while [...] "Icon" [...] <b>displays</b> <b>echoes</b> of iconoclasm, with the destruction of paintings featuring religious images, or statues and symbols of old authoritarian regimes. [...] "Premature Burial", [...] "ostensibly inspired" [...] by Edgar Allan Poe's short story of the same name, is the track from which the album title had been taken. It is, in Siouxsie's words, [...] "an expression of claustrophobia, of being hemmed in both by society's and people's limitations". For the writer Mark Paytress, the line [...] "We're all sisters and brothers" [...] looked like {{a mockery of the}} Summer of Love. The song's conclusion features what sounds like [...] "a formal choir backing for a retreating Red Army in its magnificent defeat".|$|R
