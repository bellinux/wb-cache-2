40|$|In {{the course}} of trade-policy reforms, {{countries}} must confront at least two important questions with respect to tariffs. First, what is the optimal structure of tariffs? In particular, is it optimal to tax all imports at a uniform rate? Second, should intermediate inputs be subject to import duties and if so is there a role for <b>duty</b> <b>drawbacks</b> on exports? This paper seeks to answer these important questions based on intuitive arguments, supported by literature and simple diagrams. The author argues that the introduction of tariffs on intermediate inputs complemented by <b>duty</b> <b>drawbacks</b> is welfare-improving. He further argues that if {{the objective is to}} protect the import-competing sector, uniform tariffs will minimize the distortion in production but not in consumption. If the objective is revenue, uniform tariffs will in general fail to minimize distortion in either production or consumption. The existence of smuggling, imperfect competition, and economies of scale weaken the case for uniform tariffs. The principal justification for uniform tariffs is their transparency, administrative simplicity, and relatively low level of unproductive profit-seeking activities. The author concludes that considerations of efficiency conflict with considerations of political economy. Ultimately the issue calls for more systematic empirical study.

40|$|The {{object of}} the thesis {{was to examine the}} {{planning}} system of India and to assess the ways in which it affected the rubber industry between 1951 and 1979. The planning system has been biased towards heavy industry and transportation so that tyre manufacture had priority. The initial bias in favour of autarky resulted in neglect of possible trade development, but this was gradually relaxed. The manufacture of all rubber products was controlled by a licensing system. Delays before passing a Land Reform Act in 1964 led. to a multiplication of very small rubber holdings planted with low-yielding stock. Although the output of natural rubber increased considerably, attempts at subsidised replanting of smallholdings were less successful than they might have been largely owing to lack of foreign exchange to secure trained supervisory personnel and supplies of foreign planting material. Shortage of foreign exchange stemmed from the failure to develop trade. Rubber estates were not subdivided but their expansion was severely restricted leading to a sacrifice of economic viability since they managed to replant almost totally with high-yielding stock despite heavy taxation. Estates were more productive than smallholdings. Throughout the period, natural rubber was subject to minimum price control which benefited growers. Maximum price control existed until 1963 when it was virtually abandoned although 12 large manufacturers were said to influence prices. Tyre prices were controlled up to 1974. The prices of other rubber manufactures were not controlled so that the producers were able to recoup themselves for the high prices of natural rubber. However, priority in the acquisition of raw materials enabled the tyre industry,to expand {{at the expense of other}} manufactures. Indian planning has been flexible: licensing controls and import restrictions were relaxed in the 1970 s while exports of rubber products were encouraged by such measures as cash incentives and <b>duty</b> <b>drawbacks...</b>|$|R

The planned abolition of the quotas under the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing in 2005 will alter the competitiveness of various exporting countries. Bangladesh relies heavily on textile and clothing exports and is potentially very vulnerable to this change in competitiveness. Based on assessments of quota restrictiveness and export similarity, and an analysis of its supply constraints, the paper concludes that Bangladesh could face significant pressure on its balance of payments, output, and employment when the quotas are eliminated.

40|$|<b>Duty</b> <b>drawback</b> (or rebate) systems, {{reduce or}} {{eliminate}} the duties paid on imported intermediate goods, or raw materials used {{in the production of}} exports. When a firm imports an intermediate product for use in the production of an export good, tariff payments on the imported intermediate good are either waived (<b>duty</b> <b>drawback),</b> or returned to the producer once the final product is exported (rebate). These incentive systems are often justified {{on the grounds that they}} tend to correct the anti-trade bias imposed by high tariff levels. The problem with this line of reasoning is that it assumes that tariffs are predetermined policy variables; if they were, the easiest way to reduce their anti 0 trade bias would be to eliminate them. But this is rarely done because existing levels of protection correspond to a political economy equilibrium, difficult to modify in the presence of lobbying pressures. The authors show that in a political economy setting, where tariffs and duty drawbacks are endogenously chosen through industry lobbying, full duty drawbacks are granted to exporters that use imported intermediate goods in their production. This in turn decreases their incentives to counter-lobby against high tariffs on their inputs. Indeed, under a full <b>duty</b> <b>drawback</b> regime, tariffs on intermediate goods are irrelevant to exporters, because they are fully rebated. In equilibrium, higher tariffs will be observed on these goods. Creating a regional trading block, alters the incentives by eliminating duty drawbacks on intra-regional exports, which leads to lower tariffs for goods that intra-regional exporters use as inputs. Evidence from MERCOSUR suggests that eliminating duty drawbacks for intra-regional exports, would lead to increased counter-lobbying against protection of intermediate products. The authors estimate that without this mechanism, the common external tariff would have been 3. 5 percentage points (25 percent) higher on average.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the welfare effects of raising tariffs on inputs, complemented by duty drawbacks on exports, {{in a small}} open economy. The main findings of the paper are as follows. First, a tariff on the input unaccompanied by duty drawbacks on exports works like a production tax at different rates on goods using the input. The effect of such a tariff on welfare is ambiguous in general even if the tariffs on final imports are lowered so as to maintain a constant revenue. Second, a tariff on the input accompanied by a <b>duty</b> <b>drawback</b> on exports is equivalent to a production tax on the final import and a consumption tax on the export using the input. A small change of this type improves welfare unambigously provided the export and import goods using the input are substitutes in both production and consumption. This result holds even if the policy change leads to a contraction of exportables not using the input. Finally, {{the effect of a}} large tariff on the input accompanied by a <b>duty</b> <b>drawback</b> on exports is ambiguous in general but a presumption can be established in favor of a favorable effect. The last two results are reinforced by the presence of a revenue constraint.

40|$|Although {{the rest}} of the world had waited a long time for China to open up, {{feelings}} were mixed when it actually did and began to integrate rapidly with the world economy. With the country’s recent accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), many of its trading partners are increasingly concerned that China’s competition in the world goods and capital markets may adversely affect their own growth prospects. This paper examines the implications of China’s WTO accession for other developing countries in the context of the country’s long-term process of growth and opening up. The paper argues that China’s integration into the world economy will inevitably impose adjustment costs on its trading partners in the short-to-medium term, but the benefits it generates are likely to dominate in the long run.

40|$|This paper {{points out}} that while many {{developing}} countries seek to increase their export earnings, they have not embraced fully the notion that their own pattern of import protection hurts their export performance. The paper quantifies {{the extent to which}} import protection acts as a tax on a country''s export sector and finds that for many developing countries, the magnitude of the implicit tax is substantial-about 12 percent, on average, for the countries studied. The paper also illustrates the effects of various tariff-cutting scenarios in the Doha Round on export incentives and concludes that, in general, developing countries could increase their export earnings by reducing their own import tariffs, but countries must be careful about how these tariff reductions are achieved. For example, tariff-cutting schemes that exempt certain sectors could actually be harmful.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the potential}} trade {{impact of the}} forthcoming East African Community (EAC) customs union. It examines the trade linkages among the member countries of the EAC {{and the extent to}} which the introduction of the EAC common external tariff will liberalize their trade regimes. To gauge the potential trade impact of the formation of the customs union, simulations are conducted for Kenya. The empirical results indicate that the customs union will have a beneficial effect on Kenya''s trade. The paper does not draw any conclusions on the potential welfare impact of the customs union. Finally, factors other than enhanced trade might influence Kenyan policymakers to pursue regional integration, and these include regional cooperation in "behind the border" reforms and the provision of public goods.
