Three reports on the wind variability in the UK issued in 2009, generally agree that variability of wind needs {{to be taken into account}} by adding 20% to the operating reserve, but it does not make the grid unmanageable. The additional costs, which are modest, can be quantified.|$|E

5|$|According to the <b>International</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Agency,</b> {{cellulosic}} ethanol biorefineries {{could allow}} biofuels {{to play a}} much bigger role in the future than {{organizations such as the}} IEA previously thought. Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in many regions.|$|E

5|$|The 1973–1974 {{oil embargo}} had lasting {{effects on the}} United States and other industrialized nations, which {{established}} the <b>International</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Agency</b> in response, as well as national emergency stockpiles designed to withstand months of future supply disruptions. Oil conservation efforts included lower speed limits on highways, smaller and more energy-efficient cars and appliances, year-round daylight saving time, reduced usage of heating and air-conditioning, better insulation, increased support of mass transit, and greater emphasis on coal, natural gas, ethanol, nuclear and other alternative energy sources. These long-term efforts became effective enough that US oil consumption would rise only 11 percent during 1980–2014, while real GDP rose 150 percent. But in the 1970s, OPEC nations demonstrated convincingly that their oil {{could be used as}} both a political and economic weapon against other nations, {{at least in the short}} term.|$|E
5|$|In its 2014 {{edition of}} the Technology Roadmap: Solar Photovoltaic Energy report, the <b>International</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Agency</b> (IEA) {{published}} prices for residential, commercial and utility-scale PV systems for eight major markets as of 2013 (see table below). However, DOE's SunShot Initiative has reported much lower U.S. installation prices. In 2014, prices continued to decline. The SunShot Initiative modeled U.S. system prices {{to be in the}} range of $1.80 to $3.29 per watt. Other sources identify similar price ranges of $1.70 to $3.50 for the different market segments in the U.S., and in the highly penetrated German market, prices for residential and small commercial rooftop systems of up to 100kW declined to $1.36 per watt (€1.24/W) by the end of 2014. In 2015, Deutsche Bank estimated costs for small residential rooftop systems in the U.S. around $2.90 per watt. Costs for utility-scale systems in China and India were estimated as low as $1.00 per watt.|$|E
