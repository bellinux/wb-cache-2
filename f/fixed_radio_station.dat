25|$|An amateur <b>radio</b> <b>station</b> {{established}} in a permanent structure with equipment {{that is not}} intended for portable operation {{is referred to as}} a fixed station. This is {{the most common form of}} amateur <b>radio</b> <b>station,</b> and can be found in homes, schools, and some public buildings. A typical fixed station is equipped with a transceiver and one or more antennas. For voice communications, the station will be equipped with a microphone; for communications using the Morse code, a telegraph key is common; and for communications over digital modes such as RTTY and PSK31, a station will be equipped with a specialized interface to connect the transceiver to a computer sound card. While not a requirement for radiocommunications, most <b>fixed</b> amateur <b>radio</b> <b>stations</b> are equipped with one or more computers, which serve tasks ranging from logging of contacts with other stations to various levels of station hardware control. Fixed stations might also be equipped with amplifiers, antenna rotators, SWR meters, and other station accessories.|$|R
40|$|Abstract *- In {{this paper}} we analyze the optimal number and {{locations}} of <b>fixed</b> <b>radio</b> relay <b>stations</b> forming multi-hop links in infrastructure-based wireless networks. Under {{the assumptions of}} using orthogonal channels for the hops and all links having the same average path loss exponent, we show using the spectral efficiency as a metric that the optimal relay locations are at equal intervals along the straight line between source and destination whenever multihop is to be utilized. We show that a single-hop <b>fixed</b> <b>radio</b> link can be efficiently (from a spectral efficiency perspective) replaced with the multi-hop link only if the single-hop SNR has a relatively low value. We introduce a “multi-hop criterion ” to quantify the single-hop SNR value below which a more efficient multi-hop replacement exists. We also determine the optimal number of hops for the multi-hop links having relays disposed in straight line at equal intervals. I...|$|R

In those systems that finally are automatic control systems (a. c. s.) usually the output value is the position. With the developing of the digital circuits appears the digital automatic control system. For these {{it was necessary to}} develop an especially family of actuators compatible with the digital data processing. In this paper a full directly platform controller on board of a B 767 AWACS aircraft is illustrated.

Schafer received his first FCC operator's license in 1942 and went to work for his hometown <b>radio</b> <b>station</b> WJOB(AM). He was delighted to bring home $35 a week playing 78 rpm records and 16-inch transcription discs. The following year, Schafer went to work for WOWO(AM) in Fort Wayne, Ind.
