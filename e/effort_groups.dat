5000|$|In {{response}} to Chavez's call to action, 43 religious organizations labelled the bill [...] "unfair" [...] {{and asked for}} its repeal. From there a groundswell of support developed for the recall <b>effort.</b> <b>Groups</b> that joined the recall effort included various African-American, Chicano, and Native American groups along with the AFL-CIO and National Organization for Women. Williams supports countered with claims that the recall was aimed at the [...] "wrong target" [...] {{and did not have}} the ability to overturn an act of the state legislature. The recall effort began collecting petition signatures in mid-1973. By the time they were done recall supporters turned in over 176,152 to the Arizona Secretary of State for verification. The verification process found many of the signatures to be questionable, invalid, or to have been collected by petition circulators who were not registered to vote. As a result the state Attorney General issued a ruling declaring the drive for a recall unsuccessful. The ruling was challenged, {{but it was not until}} 1976 that a federal judge ruled the Arizona Secretary of State's office had improperly rejected a number of signatures.|$|E

A raw score cutoff of, 14 produced 83 % specificity and 50 % sensitivity for detection of Poor Effort. Similarly, sensitivity was 52 % and specificity was 84 % when employing a cutoff of, 7 for Age-Corrected Scale Score. Collectively, present results suggest that Symbol Span can effectively differentiate veterans with multiple failures on established free-standing and embedded SVTs...|$|R

Following Roemer's (1998) formulation of equality of opportunity, we divide the society in n <b>effort</b> <b>groups</b> consisting of subsets of agents who exert a comparable degree of effort.

40|$|Background: The Theory of Learned Industriousness {{states that}} durable {{individual}} differences in industriousness are {{due in part to}} differences in the extent to which individuals were rewarded for high effort at an earlier time. Individuals rewarded for high effort during training are thought to generalize greater persistence to subsequent tasks than those rewarded for low effort. This study tested whether rewarded physical and/or mental effort at different intensities generalized to greater persistence at a subsequent mental task. Methods: 80 inactive 18 - 25 year-olds were randomized into four groups: Low Mental Effort, High Mental Effort, Low Physical Effort, and High Physical Effort. Each completed group-specific effort training and a mental persistence task at baseline and posttest. Results: Factorial analysis of covariance revealed a significant domain x effort interaction on persistence (F[1, 75]= 4. 93, p=. 029). High Mental Effort and Low Mental <b>Effort</b> <b>groups</b> demonstrated similar gains in persistence (d=- 0. 08, p>. 05) and points earned (d= 0. 11, p>. 05) following effort training. High Physical Effort and Low Physical Effort diverged on persistence (d=- 0. 49, p=. 004) but not points earned (d =- 0. 12, p>. 05). Conclusions: Findings suggest either that training and test stimuli were too dissimilar to cue effects of associative learning in physical <b>effort</b> <b>groups,</b> or that effects were present but overpowered by the affective and neurocognitive consequences of an acute bout of intense aerobic physical activity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{clinical}} utility of memory minus Working Memory Index (memory-WMI) discrepancy scores on the WMS-III for detecting poor effort in 145 personal injury litigants (19 poor effort, 126 adequate effort). On average, participants in the poor <b>effort</b> <b>group</b> performed significantly lower on all WMS-III memory indexes and demonstrated larger memory-WMI discrepancy scores compared to participants in the adequate <b>effort</b> <b>group.</b> Discriminant function analyses using memory-WMI discrepancy scores as independent variables revealed poor overall classification rates (60. 0 % to 63. 4 %). Based on the prevalence of unusually suppressed attention-concentration ability relative to memory functioning using unidirectional memory-WMI discrepancy scores, high specificity and negative predictive power values were found. However, there was unacceptably low sensitivity and positive predictive power. These results suggest that memory-WMI discrepancy scores on the WMS-III do not provide clinically useful information regarding response set and should be used cautiously as an indicator of poor effort...|$|R

40|$|Between July 2005 and February 2008, ten Catch Assessment Surveys (CASs) were {{conducted}} at 54 pre-selected fish landing {{sites in the}} Ugandan part of Lake Victoria comprising approximately 10 % of all landing sites {{in each of the}} 11 districts sharing the lake. The CASs {{were conducted}} following regionally harmonised Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). This report covers the CAS conducted in February 2008 and puts into context the trends generated by results of the previous surveys. The catch rates of Nile perch in gillnetting boats with motor/sail, reduced from 26. 9 kg boat- 1 day- 1 in August 2007 to 22. 8 kg boat- 1 day- 1 in February 2008. Whereas the catch rates of paddle Sesse boats remained {{more or less the same}} as in August 2007. The Nile perch catch rates of the long line fishery of the boats using motor/sail was similar, 35 and 36 kg boat- 1 day- 1 in August 2007 and February 2008 respectively but the catch rates of paddle Sesse boats using long lines showed some more increase from 19 to 22 kg boat (- 1) day (- 1). In the tilapia fishery, the catch rates of the parachute boats using gillnets showed further decrease in a row from 12. 6 kg boat- 1 day- 1 in December 2006, 11. 6 kg boat- 1 day- 1 in March 2007, 11. 2 kg boat- 1 day- 1 in August 2007 and 10. 0 kg boat- 1 day- 1 in February 2008. The overall impact of reduced catch rates in the predominant <b>effort</b> <b>groups,</b> e. g. gillnetting boats using motor/sail in the Nile perch fishery and Parachute boats using gillnets in the tilapia fishery overshadowed the increases in less dominant <b>effort</b> <b>groups</b> and resulted in the lowest monthly catch estimates recorded in the surveys conducted since 2005. Whereas there was a clear downward trend in the Nile perch catch rates of boats using gillnets, which corroborates with the information of declining stocks from the recent Acoustics surveys, the catch rates in the long line fishery remained stable and even somewhat increasing in the last four surveys. The factors that maintain high catches against reduction of fish biomass in the long line fishery and their effects on sustainability of the Nile perch fishery should be investigated further. The Mukene fishery, characterised by large fluctuations in the catch rates did not show much change in the last two surveys in August 2007 and February 2008 and the annual catch estimates showed an overall increase of 7 % from 2005 to 2007. The Mukene fishery in the Ugandan waters of Lake Victoria remained a near shore fishery in which paddle Sesse boats using small seines or scoop nets were the dominant craft...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} 1. Blue whale {{locations in}} the Southern Hemisphere and northern Indian Ocean were obtained from catches (303 239), sightings (4383 records of 8058 whales), strandings (103), Discovery marks (2191) and recoveries (95), and acoustic recordings. 2. Sighting surveys included 7 480 450 km of effort plus 14 676 days with unmeasured <b>effort.</b> <b>Groups</b> usually consisted of solitary whales (65. 2 %) or pairs (24. 6 %); larger feeding aggregations of unassociated individuals were only rarely observed. Sighting rates (groups per 1000 km from many platform types) varied by four orders of magnitude and were lowest {{in the waters of}} Brazil, South Africa, the eastern tropical Pacific, Antarctica and South Georgia; higher in the Subantarctic and Peru; and highest around Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Chile, southern Australia and south of Madagascar. 3. Blue whales avoid the oligotrophic central gyres of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, but are more common where phytoplankton densities are high, and where there are dynamic oceanographic processes like upwelling and frontal meandering. 4. Compared with historical catches, the Antarctic (‘true') subspecies is exceedingly rare and usually concentrated closer to the summer pack ice. In summer they are found throughout the Antarctic; in winter they migrate to southern Africa (although recent sightings there are rare) and to other northerly locations (based on acoustics), although some overwinter in the Antarctic. 5. Pygmy blue whales are found around the Indian Ocean and from southern Australia to New Zealand. At least four groupings are evident: northern Indian Ocean, from Madagascar to the Subantarctic, Indonesia to western and southern Australia, and from New Zealand northwards to the equator. Sighting rates are typically much higher than for Antarctic blue whales. 6. South-east Pacific blue whales have a discrete distribution and high sighting rates compared with the Antarctic. Further work is needed to clarify their subspecific status given their distinctive genetics, acoustics and length frequencies. 7. Antarctic blue whales numbered 1700 (95 % Bayesian interval 860 – 2900) in 1996 (less than 1 % of original levels), but are increasing at 7. 3 % per annum (95 % Bayesian interval 1. 4 – 11. 6 %). The status of other populations in the Southern Hemisphere and northern Indian Ocean is unknown because few abundance estimates are available, but higher recent sighting rates suggest that they are less depleted than Antarctic blue whales...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to analyze and relate the leadership behaviors and communication styles required of Infantry junior officers in their daily command tasks, in order to influence their subordinates to achieve extraordinary <b>effort,</b> <b>group</b> effectiveness and satisfaction. For this study, was used quantitative method and a survey was implemented comprising three questionnaires: one on leadership competences, one on communication styles, and one on with three criterion factors (extraordinary <b>effort,</b> <b>group</b> effectiveness and satisfaction). The survey was administered to a sample of 804 soldiers (30 Junior Officers, 81 Sergeants and 693 privates and corporals). The analysis of the data revealed that subordinates perceive that their commanders (junior officers) practice task oriented leadership behaviors, particularly on “orientation to the mission” and “decision making”. The behaviors exhibited by the officers strongly and positively relate with the “assertive” communication style. Moreover, all leadership behaviors practiced by the officers are strongly associated to the criterion factors, {{with the exception of the}} leadership dimension “vision”, which presents weaker correlations. The leadership dimensions that junior officers can conduct to promote satisfaction is “conflict management” and “participative leadership”. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
