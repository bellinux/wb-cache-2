30|$|As local {{communities}} seek {{to protect the}} environment, with local as well as regional benefit, they also seek to develop their economic opportunities. Partnerships imply mutual understanding and assistance, and as such, co-management arrangements should equally be supportive of local needs and aspirations (Reed 2008; Schlick 2011; Yang 2011). In addition, from a pragmatic perspective, when local people and communities are paid or compensated for services - whether for direct services, e.g. wildlife monitoring, anti-poaching <b>patrols,</b> <b>etc.,</b> or indirect services, e.g. land use practices that maintain ecological functions - there is also need for financing structures at the community level that are equitable, transparent and practical for local socio-economic development.|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the results of a}} systematic review of drug law enforcement evaluations. The authors describe the search procedures and document the results in five main categories: international/national interventions (e. g., interdiction and drug seizure), reactive/ directed interventions (e. g., crackdowns, raids, buy-busts, saturation <b>patrol,</b> <b>etc.),</b> proactive/ partnership interventions (e. g., third-party policing, problem-oriented policing, community policing, drug nuisance abatement, etc.), individualized interventions (e. g., arrest referral and diversion), or interventions that used a combination of reactive/directed and proactive/ partnership strategies. Results indicate that proactive interventions involving partnerships between the police and third parties and/or community entities appear to be more effective at reducing both drug and nondrug problems in drug problem places than are reactive/ directed approaches. But the general quality of research in drug law enforcement is poor, the range of interventions that have been evaluated is limited, and more high-quality research is needed across a greater variety of drug interventions. © 2007 Sage Publications...|$|R

Another group of Mohawks at the nearby location of Kahnawake, in solidarity with Kanesatake, blockaded the Mercier Bridge at the point where it passed through their territory, thereby sealing off a major access point between the Island of Montreal and Montreal's heavily populated South Shore suburbs.|$|R

40|$|Domains such as {{disaster}} rescue, security <b>patrolling</b> <b>etc.</b> often feature dynamic environments where allocations {{of tasks}} to agents become ineffective due to unforeseen conditions that may require agents {{to leave the}} team. Agents leave the team either due to arrival of high priority tasks (e. g., emergency, accident or violation) or due to some damage to the agent. Existing research in task allocation has only considered fixed number of agents {{and in some instances}} arrival of new agents on the team. However, {{there is little or no}} literature that considers situations where agents leave the team after task allocation. To that end, we first provide a general model to represent non-dedicated teams. Second, we provide a proactive approach based on sample average approximation to generate a strategy that works well across different feasible scenarios of agents leaving the team. Furthermore, we also provide a 2 -stage approach that provides a 2 -stage policy that changes allocation based on observed state of the team. Third, we provide a reactive approach that rearranges the allocated tasks to better adapt to leaving agents. Finally, we provide a detailed evaluation of our approaches on existing benchmark problems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recently, the barrier-coverage of {{wireless}} sensor network re-ceived huge attention thanks to the important applications such as bor-der protection. In practice, sensor nodes are subject to intermittent fail-ure to detect objects within its sensing range due to many reasons. There-fore, a barrier of sensor nodes may exhibit temporal loopholes. In this paper, we investigate the potential of mobile sensor nodes such as un-manned aerial vehicles and <b>human</b> <b>patrols</b> to fortify the barrier-coverage of static wireless sensors. We use a single variable rst-order grey model, GM(1, 1), based on the intruder detection history from the sensor nodes to determine which parts of the barrier is more vulnerable. Then, we relocate the available mobile sensor nodes to the identied vulnerable parts of the barrier in a timely manner. We show this relocation strategy is optimal in theory. By the simulations, we also evaluate the average performance of our algorithm. ...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{improving}} {{road safety}} {{is one of}} the major challenges in developed countries and, to this regard, attaining more effectiveness in the enforcement of road safety policies has become a key target. In particular, enforcing the requirements related to the technical and administrative mandatory documentation of on-the-road motor vehicles {{is one of the}} critical issues. The use of modern technologies in the context of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) could enable the design of a more convenient, frequent and effective enforcement system compared to the traditional <b>human</b> <b>patrol</b> controls. In this article we propose a novel system for the on-the-fly verification of mandatory technical and administrative documentation of motor vehicles. Vehicles not complying with the required regulations will be identified and sanctioned whereas those vehicles, observant of the mandatory regulations, will maintain anonymity and non-traceability of their whereabouts. The proposed system is based on the use of anonymous credentials which will be loaded onto the vehicle to automatically and on-the-fly prove holdership of required credentials without requiring the vehicle to stop beside the road. We also implement a prototype of the credential system and analyze the feasibility of our solution in terms of computational cost and time to perform such telematic controls.

40|$|Congressional {{attention}} to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) {{has caused the}} Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to move the National Airspace System (NAS) Integration project forward, but using guidelines, practices and procedures that are yet to be fully integrated with the FAA Aviation Management System. The real drive for change in the NAS will to come from both UAS operators and the government jointly seeing an accurate forecast of UAS usage demand data. This solid forecast information would truly {{get the attention of}} planners. This requires not an aggregate demand, but rather a picture of how the demand is spread across small to large UAS, how it is spread across a wide range of missions, how it is expected over time and where, in terms of geospatial locations, will the demand appear. In 2012 the Volpe Center performed a study of the overall future demand for UAS. This was done by aggregate classes of aircraft types. However, the realistic expected demand will appear in clusters of aircraft activities grouped by similar missions on a smaller geographical footprint and then growing from those small cells. In general, there is not a demand forecast that is tightly coupled to the real purpose of the mission requirements (e. g. in terms of real locations and physical structures such as wind mills to inspect, farms to survey, pipelines to <b>patrol,</b> <b>etc.).</b> Being able to present a solid basis for the demand is crucial to getting the attention of investment, government and other fiscal planners. To this end, Mosaic ATM under NASA guidance is developing a crowd sourced, demand forecast engine that can draw forecast details from commercial and government users and vendors.
