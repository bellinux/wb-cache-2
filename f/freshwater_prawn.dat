40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} smoking {{and the presence of}} aromatic herbs on the quality of <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawns</b> muscle (Macrobrachium rosenbergii), through the analysis of sensory characteristics and proximate composition. Fifty-five <b>freshwater</b> thermally stunned <b>prawns,</b> with average weight of 33. 9 ± 13. 49 g, were used. After cephalothoraxes and carapaces removal, the <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawns</b> were washed, weighed, identified, immersed in brine solution (20 %) and then smoked at a temperature of 50 to 90 °C. The experimental design was completely randomized with two treatments (T 1 = smoked <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawns</b> with herbs; T 2 = smoked <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawns</b> without herbs), with 25 experimental units per treatment. After smoking, samples were frozen (- 18 C) for proximate composition analysis and portions were sensorially evaluated by 40 tasters based on a simple stimulus method. The smoked <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawns</b> showed medium values of crude protein (44. 72 %), total lipids (1. 39 %) and ashes (3. 04 %) comparatively higher than the values of the in natura <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawns</b> (16. 80 %, 0. 30 % and 0. 89 %, respectively). The aromatic herbs did not affect significantly the proximate composition of smoked <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawns</b> and their use did not interfere on the sensory characteristics evaluated.

2500|$|The FAO {{considers}} the ecological impact of <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawn</b> farming {{to be less}} severe than in shrimp farming. [...] The prawns are cultured at much lower densities, meaning less concentrated waste products and a lesser danger of the ponds becoming breeding places for diseases. The growout ponds do not salinate agricultural land, as do those of inland marine shrimp farms. However, the lower yield per area means that the income per Ha is also lower and a given area can support fewer humans. [...] This limits the culture area to low value lands where intensification is not required. <b>Freshwater</b> <b>prawn</b> farms do not endanger mangroves, and are better amenable to small-scale businesses run by a family. However, like marine farmed shrimp, M. rosenbergii is also susceptible {{to a variety of}} viral or bacterial diseases, including white tail disease, also called [...] "white muscle disease".|$|E
2500|$|The {{technologies}} used in <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawn</b> farming {{are basically}} {{the same as in}} marine shrimp farming. Hatcheries produce postlarvae, which then are grown and acclimated in nurseries before being transferred into growout ponds, where the prawns are then fed and grown until they reach marketable size. Harvesting is done by either draining the pond and collecting the animals ("batch" [...] harvesting) or by fishing the prawns out of the pond using nets (continuous operation).|$|E
25|$|All farmed <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawns</b> today {{belong to}} the genus Macrobrachium. Until 2000, the only species farmed was the giant river prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii, {{also known as the}} Malaysian prawn). Since then, China has begun farming the Oriental river prawn (M. nipponense) in large quantities, and India farms a small amount of monsoon river prawn (M. malcolmsonii). In 2003, these three species {{accounted}} for all farmed <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawns,</b> about two-thirds M. rosenbergii and one-third M. nipponense.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to improve the quality of giant <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawns</b> postlarvae with the {{addition}} of sodium during the acclimatization medium from 12 ppt until 0 ppt. This research used Completely Randomized Design with 5 treatments and 3 replicates. The treatments of addition sodium were 0 (A); 25 (B); 50 (C); 75 (D) and 100 ppm (E) by using swamp water diluent. Experiment parameters included survival rate, oxygen consumption rate, level of osmotic work and water quality. The results indicated that the survival rates of giant <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawns</b> postlarvae were not significantly different among the treatments (varied from 84 - 91. 7 %). The osmotic levels were significantly different, with treatment on D can produce level of osmotic work on postlarvae more lower with a value of 185. 68 mOsm/l H 2 O. Oxygen consumption rates also the best on treatment D that showed 1. 378 mg O 2. g- 1. h- 1. These results showed that the addition or without addition of sodium did not significantly affect the survival rate of giant <b>freshwater</b> <b>prawns</b> postlarvae, whereas osmoregulation (level of osmotic work) and metabolism mechanism (oxygen consumption) can add as much as 75 ppm sodium in swamp water.
