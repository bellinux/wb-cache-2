Conservation biology recognizes {{different}} types of land management processes, each attempting to maintain the landscape and biota in their present form. Restoration ecology restores sites to former function, structure, and components of biological diversity through active modification of the landscapes. Reclamation deals with shifting a <b>degraded</b> <b>ecosystem</b> back toward a higher value or use, but not necessarily to its original state. Replacement of an ecosystem would create an entirely new one. Revegetation involves new additions of biota into a landscape, {{not limited to the}} original inhabitants of an area. Each method can be enriched by the application of historical ecology and the past knowledge it supplies. The interdisciplinary nature of historical ecology would permit conservation biologists to create more effective and efficient landscape improvements. Reclamation and revegetation can use a historical perspective to determine what biota will be able to sustain large populations without threatening native biota of the landscape.|$|E

For this purpose, the park has been divided into management zones to provide a geographical context to manage the park, appropriate actions to be taken to meet the specific requirements of the zones, avoid any conflicting actions and review the progress achieved from time to time. Some of the set management actions taken over the years to bring in a change from a <b>degraded</b> <b>ecosystem</b> to a near natural ecosystem are: Weed control through mechanical and chemical methods with occasional use of fire; removal of noxious weeds, vermin control, check on growth of rabbits, and rehabilitation of degraded land through a major re-vegetation programme with erosion control, maintaining seed banks and nurseries.|$|E

50|$|The land under Aravalli Biodiversity Park {{was once}} a site for mining. Martha Shinde (Scindias) had a mining lease for the 2.3 km² area. They plundered out {{whatever}} they could. For years Shinde exploited forest resources including minerals, mica, sand, stone, rocks and water. Land, which once {{was covered with a}} dense forest, soon turned into pits and hillocks. A systematic planting program is carried out and every year native trees and bushes are planted to remove unwanted weeds, i.e. Prosopis juliflora. Scientists from the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems, University of Delhi have so far got over 10 ecosystems reintroduced with over 40 biotic communities. Portions of Aravalli, which come under Gujarat, are covered with natural dense forest. However, the land on which Aravalli Biodiversity Park is being developed, was devoid of such natural growth of forest due to extensive mining of the area. The Centre for Environment Management & <b>Degraded</b> <b>Ecosystem</b> (Delhi University) works closely with Delhi Development Authority and has plans to revive native flora and fauna of Aravalli hill ranges. The planting of native species like dhau (Anogeissus pendula), babul (Acacia nilotica), kair (Capparis decidua), and dhak (Butea monosperma) has been carried out. A rangeland with native grasses has been developed. A conservatory of butterflies, orchidarium and fernery has been developed.|$|E

The chlorophyll content increased significantly meanwhile the Chlorophyll (a/b) ratio decreased; The Pn, Tr and stomatal Gs of leaves significantly decreased, but the WUE increased; These results showed that L. leucocephala seedlings could maintain a reasonable physiological activity by keeping LWC, increasing chlorophyll content and reducing photosynthetic activity when subjected to drought stress.
