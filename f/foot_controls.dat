40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} visual feedback effects and human performance in the <b>foot</b> mouse <b>control.</b> Background: Generally, computer mouse tasks are controlled by visual feedback. In order to understand the characteristics of a <b>foot</b> mouse <b>control,</b> it is important to investigate the patterns of visual feedback involved in foot-mouse control tasks. Human performance of <b>foot</b> mouse <b>control</b> is also an important factor to understand the <b>foot</b> mouse <b>control.</b> Method: Three types of mouse control were determined to investigate visual feedback effects and human performance in the <b>foot</b> mouse <b>control.</b> Visual feedback effects in the <b>foot</b> mouse <b>control</b> were compared with those of a typical hand mouse. The cursor movement speed and mental workload were measured in the three types of tasks and two types of mouses. Results: Mouse control tasks with an element of homing-in to the target were more quickly performed by the hand mouse than the foot mouse. Mental workload was also higher in the foot mouse than the hand mouse. However, in the steering movement, human performance of the <b>foot</b> mouse <b>control</b> was not lower than that of the hand mouse control. Visual feedback in the <b>foot</b> mouse <b>control</b> was less required than in the hand mouse <b>control.</b> Conclusion: The <b>foot</b> mouse was not efficient in the most mouse control tasks, compared to the hand mouse. However, the foot mouse was efficient in the steering movement, moving...|$|R

50|$|The da Vinci System {{has been}} {{designed}} to improve upon conventional laparoscopy, in which the surgeon operates while standing, using hand-held, long-shafted instruments, which have no wrists. The da Vinci System consists of a surgeon’s console that is typically in the same room as the patient and a patient-side cart with four interactive robotic arms controlled from the console.Three of the arms are for tools that hold objects, act as a scalpel, scissors, bovie, or unipolar or bipolar electrocautery instruments. The fourth arm is for an endoscopic camera with two lenses that gives the surgeon full stereoscopic vision from the console. The surgeon sits at the console and looks through two eye holes at a 3-D image of the procedure, meanwhile maneuvering the arms with two hand controllers. Right sided <b>foot</b> <b>controls</b> operate the energy supplied to the instruments to cauterize, coagulate, or cut the tissue. Left sided <b>foot</b> <b>controls</b> help to move the endoscopic camera in or out and therefore bring the surgical image closer or further away. The da Vinci System scales, filters and translates the surgeon's hand movements into more precise micro-movements of the instruments, which operate through small incisions in the body.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [37]- 38) This study compared {{two types}} of medial longitudinal arch taping techniques for their effects on pronation of the foot while walking on a treadmill. The four hypotheses are: a) arch taping of the right foot will reduce the angle of pronation of the right foot compared to the right <b>foot</b> <b>control</b> (control was a dummy tape job applied to the foot), b) LowDye taping of the right foot will reduce the angle of pronation for of the right foot compared to the right <b>foot</b> <b>control,</b> c) arch taping of the left foot will reduce the angle of pronation for the left foot compared to the left <b>foot</b> <b>control,</b> and d) LowDye taping of the left foot will reduce the angle of pronation of the left foot compared to the left <b>foot</b> <b>control.</b> High speed cinematography was used to film the subjects (n = 20) as they walked on a treadmill. The two taping techniques did not significantly reduce the angle of pronation (p>. 0125). One comparison of the four studied proved to be significant. Left Control Compared to Left Arch Tape (t = 3. 40) was the only comparison with statistical significance, but with a mean difference of 1. 6 degrees the researcher felt that it offered no practical significance (5 to 10 degrees of difference would offer practical significance). The researcher found {{that the use of}} athletic tape as applied to the foot in the present study does not affect the angle of pronation. Further studies are necessary to examine what arch taping actually does to the foot to support its usefulness in athletic training. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R

The Taurus II {{uses the same}} synthesis engine as a contemporary lead synthesizer, the Moog Rogue. The Taurus II was controlled through 18 foot pedals, modulation and pitch bend wheels, and a CV interface. The synthesizer also increased the amount of timbres and effects available. However, the Taurus II had no patch memory or <b>foot</b> <b>controls</b> apart from the pedals. Instead, the control panel was raised so that the player could manipulate it manually during performance.|$|E
5000|$|Foot-control: on/off {{and speed}} {{controls}} are foot-operated, and {{built into a}} pedal that also controls the steering mechanism. Steering may be via electronically controlled servo motors, or in early-model (and late-model low-end units), a push-pull cable. Foot controlled trolling motors require a specialized mounting bracket that bolts horizontally to the deck.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multiple-model and Boolean logic reasoning (MMBLR) approach {{to detect and}} identify faults in the suction <b>foot</b> <b>control</b> of a climbing robot. For this control system, some fault models are easily given by kinematics equations. Moreover, the logic relations of the system states have been known in advance. Based on {{the combination of the}} multiple-model adaptive estimation (MMAE) algorithm and the Boolean logic reasoning, the MMBLR approach is properly fit for the fault detection and identification (FDI) application to the climbing robot. In the MMBLR architecture, the MMAE algorithm is used to reliably detect and identify the model-known faults. Then based on the robot&# 39;s states and the results of the MMAE, other faults are detected and identified using the Boolean logic reasoning. Experimental results validated that the faults of the sensors and actuators in the suction <b>foot</b> <b>control</b> of the robot can be readily detected and identified by the MMBLR approach.
