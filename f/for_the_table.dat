5|$|Although the lilac-brown bolete {{was once}} {{considered}} edible, caution is typically recommended in modern field guides when considering this bolete <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> after several poisonings {{were reported in}} northeastern North America.

5|$|Leccinum manzanitae is edible, and its {{taste is}} {{sometimes}} rated highly, although others {{have described the}} flavor as bland. Drying the mushroom may improve the flavor.

5|$|Novices may mistake {{juvenile}} death caps for edible puffballs or mature specimens {{for other}} edible Amanita species, such as A.lanei, so some authorities recommend avoiding the collecting of Amanita species <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> altogether.

5|$|A choice edible species, Boletus aereus {{is highly}} {{appreciated}} in Southern Europe for its culinary qualities, {{and is considered}} by many to be gastronomically superior to Boletus edulis. In the vicinity of Borgotaro in the Province of Parma of northern Italy, the four species Boletus edulis, B.aereus, B.reticulatus (formerly known as B.aestivalis), and B.pinophilus have been recognised for their superior taste and officially termed Fungo di Borgotaro. Here, these mushrooms have been collected and exported commercially for centuries. Throughout Spain, it is one of the wild edible fungi most commonly collected <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> particularly in Aragon, where it is harvested for sale in markets.|$|E

5|$|As {{the common}} name suggests, the fungus is highly toxic, and is {{responsible}} for the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide. Its biochemistry has been researched intensively for decades, and , or half a cap, of this mushroom is estimated to be enough to kill a human. In 2006, a family of three in Poland was poisoned, resulting in one death and the two survivors requiring liver transplants. In 2017, 14 people in California were poisoned, including an 18 month old who required a liver transplant. Some authorities strongly advise against putting suspected death caps in the same basket with fungi collected <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and to avoid even touching them. Furthermore, the toxicity is not reduced by cooking, freezing, or drying.|$|E
5|$|Guinea fowl {{originated}} in southern Africa, and the species most often kept as poultry is the helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris). It is a medium-sized grey or speckled bird {{with a small}} naked head with colourful wattles and a knob on top, and was domesticated {{by the time of}} the ancient Greeks and Romans. Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry Lyme disease. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators. Their flesh and eggs can be eaten in the same way as chickens, young birds being ready <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> at the age of about four months.|$|E
5|$|The {{saprobic}} fungus {{grows on}} decaying sticks and branches in damp spots on forest floors, generally buried under leaf litter {{or in the}} soil. The cup-shaped fruit bodies are usually produced during the cooler months of winter and early spring. The brilliant red interior of the cups—from which both the common and scientific names are derived—contrasts with the lighter-colored exterior. The edibility of the fruit bodies is not clearly established, but its small size, tough texture and insubstantial fruitings would dissuade most people from collecting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> The fungus has been used medicinally by the Oneida Indians, and also as a colorful component of table decorations in England. Molliardiomyces eucoccinea is the name given to the imperfect form of the fungus that lacks a sexually reproductive stage in its life cycle.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s Knight visited the Bertram Mills Circus at Olympia in West London. Mills' circus {{was a highly}} {{polished}} show with internationally renowned performers. Knight painted some of these performers, such as the clown Whimsical Wilson, several times. Charivari or The Grand Parade, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1929, depicts practically the entire circus cast of performers and animals. Throughout 1929 and 1930 Knight went {{on a tour of}} British towns with the combined Bertram Mills and Great Carmo's Circus. Painting within a working circus forced Knight to paint at great speed, as the performers rarely had much time to pose. Knight responded by painting directly onto the canvas without any preliminary drawing. Whilst this led to some of her circus scenes appearing 'flat', her paintings of small groups of clowns, such as The Three Clowns (1930) and Old Time Clowns (1957), were much more successful. Knight's Circus Folk exhibition, at the Alpine Club in 1930, was heavily criticised in art journals, but her paintings of more mundane subjects, such as domestic interiors and London streets, were highly praised. Notable works from this period include Susie and the Wash-basin (1927), Blue and Gold (1927), A Cottage Bedroom (1929) and Spring in St. John's Wood (1933). In 1934 Knight developed a series of circus designs for the Modern Art <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> tableware range produced by Clarice Cliff.|$|E
