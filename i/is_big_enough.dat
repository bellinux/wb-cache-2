With the number of students per batch increasing every year, the need to expand this campus will become more serious in the near future.|$|E
25|$|The boat {{is first}} {{directly}} addressed in chapter 43; there Gangleri asks that, if Skíðblaðnir {{is the best}} of ships, what {{there is to know about}} it, and asks if there is no other ship as good or as large as it. High responds that while Skíðblaðnir is the finest ship and the most ingeniously created, the biggest ship is in fact Naglfar, which is owned by Muspell. The Sons of Ivaldi, who High adds are dwarfs, crafted the ship and gave it to Freyr. High continues that the ship <b>is</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> for all of the gods to travel aboard it with wargear and weapons in tow, and that, as soon as its sail is hoisted, the ship finds good wind, and goes wherever it need be. It is made up of so many parts and with such craftsmanship that, when it is not needed at sea, it may be folded up like cloth and placed into one's pocket. Gangleri comments that Skíðblaðnir sounds like a great ship, and that it must have taken a lot of magic to create something like it.|$|E

25|$|Greg Hill still {{refused to}} race ABA races because he {{allegedly}} hated the ABA's direct transfer {{system in which}} the winner of the first moto would then sit out and not race the second and third cycle of motos until the Main, or if the race <b>is</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough,</b> the semis, quarter semis, etc. He and many other racers preferred the NBL's Olympic or cumulative {{system in which the}} qualifying rounds would be run three times and the average place in each round would be added and the four lowest numbers would advance to the main. This system put a premium on consistency while the Transfer System was a little closer to luck, both good and bad for a racer. The ABA used a similar system during its controversial 1982 and 1983 Grand Nationals to choose its number one title to minimize anyone lucking into or out of the title. Also, points are awarded in the motos in the Cumulative System as well as the main so the racer doesn't walk away with nothing if he doesn't advance. Hill's objections seem odd considering he would race in the future sanctioning body the United States Bicycle Association (USBA) which used the transfer system. The USBA did offer larger, more consistent pro purses than the ABA generally.|$|E
500|$|Early in 1940 Lansbury's health {{began to}} fail; {{although}} unaware, he [...] {{was suffering from}} stomach cancer. In {{an article published in}} the socialist magazine Tribune, published on 25 April 1940, he made a final statement of his Christian pacifism: [...] "I hold fast to the truth that this world <b>is</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> for all, that we are all brethren, children of one Father". Lansbury died on 7 May 1940, at the Manor House Hospital in Golders Green. His funeral in St Mary's Church, Bow, was followed by cremation at Ilford Crematorium, before a memorial service in Westminster Abbey. His ashes were scattered at sea, in accordance with the wish expressed in his will: [...] "I desire this because although I love England very dearly... I am a convinced internationalist".|$|E

Folly is indigenous to the soil [...] Absurdity has every encouragement afforded it; and nonsense has room to flourish in." [...] Characters of vastly different types are all welcome and fit into his scheme: [...] "the same house <b>is</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> to hold Malvolio, the Countess, Maria, Sir Toby, and Sir Andrew Ague-cheek." [...] He particularly admires the character of Viola, whom Shakespeare gives many speeches of [...] "impassioned sweetness". Characterising the play as a whole by quoting the author's own words in it—"Shakespear alone could describe the effect of his own poetry."—he reflects that the play's poetry comes o'er the ear like the sweet south/That breathes upon a bank of violets,/Stealing and giving odour.|$|E

An E8 gauge group, for example, would have 8 neutral bosons, 120 charged bosons and 120 charged anti-bosons.

Each of these possess theoretical problems.|$|E

[...] He did however write to Allen asking him to [...] "take the necessary action" [...] regarding Blamey's remarks. By the New Year he had been given further details and was enraged. Again writing to his wife; [...] "Hugh sent me a precis of his (T's) speech to the old team and to the officers. Hells Bells, it was a cowardly bit of work and untrue in every detail.

Meanwhile, a poll for The Independent by BMG Research, suggested that working class voters were more likely to consider Corbyn [...] "incompetent" [...] than those from the middle class, and a higher proportion thought he was [...] "out of touch" [...] also. Martin Kettle of The Guardian [...] wrote that [...] "many Labour MPs, even some who face defeat, want an early election" [...] to prove decisively that Corbyn's Labour is unelectable as a government.

After discussions at the 2011 Comic-Con with Uziel and Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon, Tancharoen said to expect an origin story in the style of Rebirth and Legacy as opposed to the traditional Mortal Kombat mythology. He said, [...] "I've always been a fan of properties like Batman where you can expand the universe in different directions.
