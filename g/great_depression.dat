5|$|In {{response}} to the <b>Great</b> <b>Depression,</b> successive governments pursued a strategy designed to transform Argentina into a country self-sufficient in industry as well as agriculture. The strategy of growth was based on import substitution in which tariffs and quotas for final goods were raised. The import-substitution process had progressively been adopted since the late 19th century, but the <b>Great</b> <b>Depression</b> intensified it. The government's encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agriculture, and agricultural production fell dramatically.|$|E

40|$|A paradox {{exists in}} modern schooling: {{students}} are simultaneously more {{positive about the}} future and more depressed than ever. We suggest that these two phenomena may be linked. Two studies demonstrated that {{students are more likely to}} be depressed when educational aspirations exceed expectations. In Study 1 (N = 85) aspiring to a thesis grade higher than one expected predicted <b>greater</b> <b>depression</b> at the beginning and end of the academic year. In Study 2 (N = 2820) aspiring to a level of education (e. g., attending college) higher than one expected to achieve predicted <b>greater</b> <b>depression</b> cross-sectionally and five years later. In both cases the negative effects of aspiring high while expecting low persisted even after controlling for whether or not students achieved their educational aspirations. These findings highlight the danger of teaching students to aspire higher without also investing time and money to ensure that students can reasonably expect to achieve their educational goals...|$|R
