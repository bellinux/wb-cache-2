40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop practical models for predicting the thermal performance of a wet-coil indirect evaporative cooler (IEC). Through statistical analysis of cooling and heat exchange effectiveness data generated by a simple epsilon-NTU (number of transfer units) method, simplified models returning the thermal performance of a wet-coil IEC were developed. Linear regression equations were derived {{as a function of the}} major design parameters and interactions that strongly affected the wet-coil IEC&# 39;s performance. A pilot wet-coil IEC unit was built to validate the proposed models. Effectiveness data were obtained under a controlled range of operating conditions in an environmental chamber. Then, the energy-saving potential achievable by integrating a wet-coil IEC into a conventional variable air volume (VAV) system for pre-conditioning the outdoor air intake was quantitatively evaluated. The experimental results showed that more than 75 % cooling effectiveness and 59 % <b>heat</b> <b>reclaim</b> effectiveness could be achieved under wet and dry operating conditions, respectively. The experimental data acquired using the pilot unit agreed well with the thermal effectiveness predicted by the proposed models.

40|$|Bartlesville (Oklahoma) Energy Technology Center (BETC) {{engineers}} made a {{study of}} recycling waste heat {{from one of the}} Power Plant boilers. The study showed that a system could be designed that would <b>reclaim</b> this waste <b>heat</b> and then utilize it to preheat air for boiler operation. The system incorporated a heat pipe heat exchanger flanged in a stack by-pass loop that would efficiently capture and transfer heat at low temperature differences (?T 350 - 5000 F). After <b>reclaiming</b> <b>heat</b> from this source, the burner air supply is preheated by passing through the heat exchanger. Sensitive design problems that had to be resolved were: Overall cost-effectiveness; below dew point cooling of stack gas causing acid corrosion; and selection of an effective heat exchanger for this application The candidate boiler is one of two that generate high temperature hot water (HTHW) for BETC facility heating and cooling. One unit normally handles the heating and cooling load while the other is in standby status. The preheat system was designed by BETC engineers. The new stack assembly was fabricated by a local metal shop, and was installed by BETC maintenance personnel. The cost of the heat exchanger and other hard-ware was $ 7, 562. Operational results show that boiler efficiency has increased between 6 and 7 percent, which reflects the percent of reduction in fuel consumption. At full-load conditions, the burner supply air is preheated to 350 oF and stack gas is cooled to 310 oF. Corrosion damage to the heat exchanger and other internal parts are non-existent. Natural gas is the boiler fuel, and as expected, no residue coating of the heat exchanger has developed. To date, we are well pleased with the performance of the system. The savings in fuel and dollars speaks for itself.

Logic threshold control strategy is put forward to distribute power between the gas engine and battery pack. Test research was operated to verify the advantageous performance of LiFePO 4 battery HPGHP. The results show that LiFePO 4 battery HPGHP can achieve an obvious energy saving effect, especially in low-load condition and high-load condition.

40|$|The design, {{operating}} characteristics, {{and energy}} savings from an energy recovery system employed on a potato chip fryer which became operational in December, 1979, is discussed. The design incorporates a modification to an odor control system which permits heat {{recovery from the}} fryer cooking fumes. The fumes consist primarily of water vapor (11 psia) and air (3. 7 psia) at a temperature of 275 F. About 10 % of the available energy is dissipated in a scrubber which removes particulate material and reduces the mixture temperature to about 195 F. This flow is passed through a water-cooled condenser. The heat absorbed in the water-cooled condenser coils is in excess of 11. 5 MM BTU/hr. for a 4200 lb/hr potato chip fryer.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{environmental}} concerns {{have led to}} the search of technical solutions that meet sustainable development criteria. In France, this was resulted in recommendations from Grenelle 21 and in a voluntary commitment convention among construction companies, in 2009, for reducing the environmental impact of roadworks (reuse of all waste from the process, reduce greenhouse gases, saving non-renewable materials, eco-calculator, [...] .). To meet these expectations, high modulus asphalt mixtures (EME) have been, for over than 20 years, a high performance solution to address aspects related to saving materials and significant increase in service life of the pavement structure. On the other hand, hot mix asphalt recycling using high percentages of reclaimed asphalt pavement (> 50 %) has demonstrated effectiveness in improving the ‘environmental performance’. This paper presents an overview about the evolution over 20 to 30 years of hot mix recycling in plant, making an assessment of the current situation in France and comparing it with the worlwide situation (discussed in PIARC 2010), and addressing the use of reclaimed asphalt pavement in the major European countries, as well as United States, Canada and Japan. This work presents the most important characteristics when combining these two subjects, i. e., an EME containing 50 and 65 % of reclaimed asphalt pavement. The main topics discussed include homogenity on the recycled material's source (asphalt wearing course), preliminar studies in laboratory, new mixing plants containing two separate mixers (one is specific for <b>heating</b> the <b>reclaimed</b> material and for quality control). The main idea of this paper is verifying the performance of the asphalt mix, for comparisons concerning the preliminary studies and the laboratory tests with asphalt mixes from the plant, in order to assess the mechanical properties, such as complex modulus, fatigue resistance and rutting.

Rejuvenator agent was not employed, but a hard asphalt. Conventional properties of the bitumen are also presented, as well as rheological properties and physical composition of the asphalt. Finally, this work shows an operational protocol developed for producing the recycled mixes in laboratory.

These entailed systems installation and monitoring in Ireland, Denmark and Poland.

40|$|Energy {{recovery}} systems aim {{to recover}} waste energy that is normally {{lost to the}} environment. Waste energy comes {{in a variety of}} forms. Many processes involving building HVAC involves transferring energy from one working fluid to another. Governing codes put strict requirements on ventilation requirements for various occupancy types. Increased ventilation demands more from the HVAC equipment since outdoor air (ventilation air) is being brought into the building and requires tempering in order to retain occupant comfort. The energy required to temper this air increases as ventilation rates increase. Many commercial buildings have implemented exhaust air energy recovery, or runaround loops in order to re-capture the energy in the exhaust air streams. Residential HVAC systems are no different than commercial systems, just less complex typically. There is little being done to recover energy lost in the residential sector. The commercial industry is much further along in energy recovery systems than the residential sector. This is partially {{due to the lack of}} interest by home owners. Residential buildings consumed 35 % of the total U. S. natural gas consumption in 2008 accounting for more than $ 90 billion dollars annually. Typical residential furnaces are 80 % thermally efficient. The wasted energy is largely found in the combustion products,or flue gasses. By recovering heat from the flue gases, this energy can be reclaimed and put to use. Having a source for energy recovery is only part of the predicament. A desirable application of the recovered energy is also necessary. Home owners need to see a quick payback as well as an incentive in order to be enticed to make capital investments. Without government aid or tax incentives many individuals lose interest.

40|$|Phase I Due to {{the growing}} {{interest}} in establishing a domestic hydrogen infrastructure, several hydrogen fueling stations already have been established around the country as demonstration units. While these stations help build familiarity with hydrogen fuel in their respective communities, hydrogen vehicles are still several years from mass production. This limited number of hydrogen vehicles translates to a limited demand for hydrogen fuel, a significant hurdle for the near-term establishment of commercially viable hydrogen fueling stations. By incorporating a fuel cell and cogeneration system with a hydrogen fueling station, the resulting energy station can compensate for low hydrogen demand by providing both hydrogen dispensing and {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) generation. The electrical power generated by the energy station can be fed back into the power grid or a nearby facility, which in turn helps offset station costs. Hydrogen production capacity not used by vehicles can be used to support building heat and power loads. In this way, an energy station can experience greater station utility while more rapidly recovering capital costs, providing an increased market potential relative to a hydrogen fueling station. At an energy station, hydrogen is generated on-site. Part of the hydrogen is used for vehicle refueling and part of the hydrogen is consumed by a fuel cell. As the fuel cell generates electricity and sends it to the power grid, excess <b>heat</b> is <b>reclaimed</b> through a cogeneration system for use in a nearby facility. Both the electrical generation and heat reclamation serve to offset the cost of purchasing the equivalent amount of energy for nearby facilities and the energy station itself. This two-phase project assessed the costs and feasibility of developing a hydrogen vehicle fueling station in conjunction with electricity and cogenerative heat generation for nearby Federal buildings. In order to determine which system configurations and operational patterns would be most viable for an energy station, TIAX developed several criteria for selecting a representative set of technology configurations. TIAX applied these criteria to all possible technology configurations to determine an optimized set for further analysis, as shown in Table ES- 1. This analysis also considered potential energy station operational scenarios and their impact upon hydrogen and power production. For example, an energy station with a 50 -kWe reformer could generate enough hydrogen to serve up to 12 vehicles/day (at 5 kg/fill) or generate up to 1, 200 kWh/day, as shown in Figure ES- 1. Buildings that would be well suited for an energy station would utilize both the thermal and electrical output of the station. Optimizing the generation and utilization of thermal energy, hydrogen, and electricity requires a detailed look at the energy transfer within the energy station and the transfer between the station and nearby facilities. TIAX selected the Baseline configuration given in Table ES- 1 for an initial analysis of the energy and mass transfer expected from an operating energy station. Phase II The purpose of this technical analysis was to analyze the development of a hydrogen-dispensing infrastructure for transportation applications through the installation of a 50 - 75 kW stationary fuel cell-based energy station at federal building sites. The various scenarios, costs, designs and impacts of such a station were quantified for a hypothetical cost-shared program that utilizes a natural gas reformer to provide hydrogen fuel for both the stack(s) and a limited number of fuel cell powered vehicles, with the possibility of using cogeneration to support the building heat load...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to reduce the {{dependence}} on fossil fuels, a variety of research initiatives has focused on increasing the efficiency of conventional energy systems. One such approach is to use waste <b>heat</b> recovery to <b>reclaim</b> energy that is typically lost {{in the form of}} dissipative heat. An example of such reclamation is the use of waste heat recovery systems that take low-temperature heat and deliver cooling in space-conditioning applications. In this work, an ejector-based chiller driven by waste heat will be studied from the system to component to sub-component levels, with a specific focus on the ejector. The ejector is a passive device used to compress refrigerants in waste heat driven heat pumps without the use of high grade electricity or wear-prone complex moving parts. With such ejectors, the electrical input for the overall system can be reduced or eliminated entirely under certain conditions, and package sizes can be significantly reduced, allowing for a cooling system that can operate in off-grid, mobile, or remote applications. The performance of this system, measured typically as a coefficient of performance, is primarily dependent on the performance of the ejector pump. This work uses analytical and numerical modeling techniques combined with flow visualization to determine the exact mechanisms of ejector operation, and makes suggestions for ejector performance improvement. Specifically, forcing the presence of two-phase flow has been suggested as a potential tool for performance enhancement. This study determines the effect of two-phase flow on momentum transfer characteristics inside the ejector while operating with refrigerants R 134 a and R 245 fa. It is found that reducing the superheat at motive nozzle inlet results in a 12 - 13 % increase in COP with a 14 - 16 K decrease in driving waste heat temperature. The mechanisms of this improvement are found to be a combination of two effects: the choice of operating fluid (wet vs. dry) and the effect of two-phase flow on the effectiveness of momentum transfer. It is recommended that ejector-based chillers be operated such that the motive nozzle inlet is near saturation, and environmentally friendly dry fluids such as R 245 fa be used to improve performance. This work provides critical methods for ejector modeling and validation through visualization, as well as guidance on measures to improve ejector design with commensurate beneficial effects on cooling system COP.

40|$|Hot water {{plays an}} import role in modem life. The {{consumption}} {{of hot water}} represents {{a significant part of}} the nation's energy consumption. One way of reducing the energy consumption involved, and hence the cost of that energy, is to <b>reclaim</b> <b>heat</b> from the waste warm water that is discharged to the sewer each day. The potential for economic waste water heat recovery depends on both the quantity available and whether the quality fits the requirement of the heating load. To recover heat from waste water in residential and commercial buildings is hard to achieve in quality because of its low temperature range. Nevertheless, efforts to recycle this waste energy could result in significant energy savings. The objective of this research was to develop a multiple panel thermosyphon heat exchanger for a waste water heat recovery system. The advantage of the system proposed in this work is that it not only provides useful energy transfer during simultaneous flow of cold supply and warm drain water but also has the ability to store recovered energy at the bottom of a hot water storage tank for later use. While this concept is not new, the design of the heat exchanger proposed for the present study is significantly different from those used previously. Component experiments were carried out to determine the performance characteristics of a single thermosyphon panel. By changing the inclination angle of the single panel heat exchanger and varying its working condition, it was found that the inclination angle of 10 ° could be identified as the minimum inclination angle at which good performance was still obtained. The close values of the overall heat transfer coefficients between top surface of the panel insulated and both top and bottom surfaces of the panel uninsulated shows that the overall heat transfer coefficient of the single panel was dominated by the bottom surface of the panel. Even if in a worst case the top surface of the panel might be possibly covered by the deposits from the waste water, it would not affect much on the heat transfer performance of the panel. Measurements of hot water usage and waste water temperature and flow rates were obtained for a potential application of the proposed exchanger (the dishwasher for the kitchen in the University Halls of Residence). A model of a multi-panel thermosyphon heat exchanger was also developed to predict the energy savings that would be expected if such a heat exchanger was used in this situation. The result indicated that an overall electricity of 7500 kWh could be saved annually from the dishwasher system by employing a four-panel thermosyphon heat exchanger...|$|R
