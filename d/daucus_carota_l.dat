Additionally, studies have shown that carotol may be involved in allelopathic interactions expressing activity as an antifungal, herbicidal and insecticidal agent.|$|E

40|$|<b>Daucus</b> <b>carota</b> <b>L.</b> is an {{important}} vegetable food crop with high nutritive value. The changing climate, pollution, loss of vegetation has affected the crop quality {{and there is a}} need to improve the variety. So the present investigation was taken with an aim to induce mutation in callus cell lines for crop improvement. Callus induction from stem and leaf explants of in vitro grown <b>Daucus</b> <b>carota</b> <b>L.</b> plantlets was observed on 1 X MS medium with 3 % sucrose, 1 % agar fortified with 2 mg L - 1 2, 4 -D.

Callus cell lines grown on media containing 200 μM of sodium azide gave the best result with callus multiplication. Callus exposed at different time intervals under UV radiation showed multiplication of callus in all the exposures. Shoot induction was achieved for both the mutants on 2 mg L - 1 BAP containing medium. The physiological estimation revealed that protein content (0. 460 ± 0. 04 mg mL - 1) in 6 min UV exposed cell lines and carbohydrate content (0. 820 ± 0. 08 mg mL - 1) in 4 min UV exposed cell lines are high when compared to control cell lines, sodium azide and other UV mutated cell lines.

40|$|New therapies for leukaemia are {{urgently}} needed. Carrots {{have been}} suggested as a potential treatment for leukaemia in traditional medicine and have previously been studied in other contexts as potential sources of anticancer agents. Indicating that carrots may contain bioactive compounds, which may show potential in leukaemia therapies. This study investigated the effects of five fractions from carrot juice extract (CJE) on human lymphoid leukaemia cell lines, together with five purified bioactive compounds found in <b>Daucus</b> <b>carota</b> <b>L,</b> including: three polyacetylenes (falcarinol, falcarindiol and falcarindiol- 3 -acetate) and two carotenoids (beta-carotene and lutein). Their effects on induction of apoptosis using Annexin V/PI and Caspase 3 activity assays analysed via flow cytometry and inhibition of cellular proliferation using Cell Titer Glo assay and cell cycle analysis were investigated. Treatment of all three lymphoid leukaemia cell lines with the fraction from carrot extracts which contained polyacetylenes and carotenoids was significantly more cytotoxic than the 4 other fractions. Treatments with purified polyacetylenes also induced apoptosis in a dose and time responsive manner. Moreover, falcarinol and falcarindiol- 3 -acetate isolated from <b>Daucus</b> <b>carota</b> <b>L</b> were more cytotoxic than falcarindiol. In contrast, the carotenoids showed no significant effect on either apoptosis or cell proliferation {{in any of the}} cells investigated. This suggests that polyacetylenes rather than beta-carotene or lutein are the bioactive components found in <b>Daucus</b> <b>carota</b> <b>L</b> and could be useful in the development of new leukemic therapies.

Roots were soaked in Cd(NO 3) 2 solutions of 3 x 10 - 6 M and 5 x 10 - 5 M concentrations for 6 hours. Roots were strongly colonised and their Cd-content increased in case of the higher Cd-treatment only. In contrast to earlier results, Cd treatment reduced putrescine and spermidine contents of the non-mycorrhizal (NM) Daucus carota roots, whereas that of mycorrhizal (M) roots did not change. Spermine content showed {{a slight increase in}} all cases. NM roots always had higher PA ratios.

The test control rats were administered with INH (27 mg/kg) and RMP (54 mg/kg) for 4 weeks to induce oxidative stress. Rats were pretreated with doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg of aqueous extracts of <b>Daucus</b> <b>carota</b> and Moringa oleifera respectively for 4 weeks then INH and RMP were administered for another 4 weeks. Rats were also co-administered with 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg of the extracts plus INH and RMP for 4 weeks. The {{effect of the}} extracts on oxidative stress was determined by monitoring the serum malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration. Pretreatment and coadministration of <b>Daucus</b> <b>carota</b> and Moringa oleifera aqueous extracts significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced serum MDA levels compared with the test control. The co-administration of the extracts with the anti-tubercular drugs had a more profound effect in reducing serum MDA concentration compared with pretreatment with the aqueous extracts of D. carota root and M. oleifera leaf.
