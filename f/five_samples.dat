2500|$|The Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission {{states that}} it [...] "assumed" [...] melted fuel rods in unit 2 have {{released}} radioactive substances into the coolant water, which subsequently leaked out through an unknown route to the unit 2 turbine building basement. To {{reduce the amount of}} leaking water, TEPCO reduced the amount of water pumped into the unit 2 reactor, from 16 tons per hour to 7 tons per hour, which could lead to higher reactor temperatures. The highly radioactive water halts work on restoring the cooling pumps and other powered systems to reactors 1–4. TEPCO confirms finding low levels of plutonium in <b>five</b> <b>samples</b> during 21 and 22 March. Enriched levels of Plutonium-238, relative to Plutonium-239 and Plutonium-240, at two of the sites in the plant (solid waste area and field) indicate that contamination has occurred at those sites due to the [...] "recent incident". Nonetheless, the overall levels of plutonium for all samples are about the same as background Pu levels resulting from atmospheric nuclear bomb testing in the past. However, these weapons did not use fuel that has decayed significantly. Such nuclear accidents as this one are a potent source of biologically accumulating isotopes of transuranic elements such as curium and americium which are incorporated into bones, complexed into the Ca/PO4 hydroxide.|$|E

30|$|In the {{hierarchical}} routing protocols, such as EEUC [12] and UCR [13], the clustering time is static. One round includes <b>five</b> <b>sampling</b> periods, and the clustering {{time is the}} time of one round (<b>five</b> <b>sampling</b> periods). If the cluster heads have enough energy and the clustering timer expires, then there is a clustering process in the whole network, which will waste energy consumption. If the energy of cluster heads has been significantly lower than the average energy of network, then the delayed clustering will exhaust energy of parts of cluster heads faster and destroy the connectivity of network. Therefore, the static clustering time is not good enough to balance energy consumption among sensor nodes.|$|R
