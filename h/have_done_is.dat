500|$|Jordan {{claimed to}} have won the battle and stopped an Israeli drive on Balqa Governorate in {{intentions}} of occupying it and turning into a security buffer zone, {{which was supposed to}} serve as a punishment, due to the Jordanian support to the PLO. The Jordanians made this assumption as they saw the size of the raiding Israeli forces entering the battle. Arafat said [...] "What we <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> to make the world... realize that the Palestinian is no longer refugee number so and so, but the member of a people who hold the reins of their own destiny and {{are in a position to}} determine their own future". Palestinians and Arabs generally considered the battle a psychological victory over the IDF, which had been seen as 'invincible' until then, and recruitment to guerilla units soared. Fatah reported that 5,000 volunteers applied to join within 48 hours of the battle. By late March, there were nearly 20,000 fedayeen in Jordan.|$|E

500|$|Rehearsals {{began in}} January 1945; either Rodgers or Hammerstein was always present. Raitt was {{presented}} with the lyrics for [...] "Soliloquy" [...] on a five-foot long sheet of paper—the piece ran nearly eight minutes. [...] Staging such a long solo number presented problems, and Raitt later stated that he {{felt that they were}} never fully addressed. [...] At some point during rehearsals, Molnár came to see what they had done to his play. [...] There are a number of variations on the story. [...] As Rodgers told it, while watching rehearsals with Hammerstein, the composer spotted Molnár {{in the rear of the}} theatre and whispered the news to his partner. [...] Both sweated through an afternoon of rehearsal in which nothing seemed to go right. [...] At the end, the two walked to the back of the theatre, expecting an angry reaction from Molnár. [...] Instead, the playwright said enthusiastically, [...] "What you <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> so beautiful. [...] And you know what I like best? [...] The ending!" [...] Hammerstein wrote that Molnár became a regular attendee at rehearsals after that.|$|E
500|$|The autumn {{work was}} {{somewhat}} {{in reaction to}} the recent compositions of Christ in the Garden of Olives by his friends Paul Gauguin and Émile Bernard. [...] Frustrated by their work which he qualified with the words [...] "nothing was observed", Van Gogh painted [...] "in the groves, morning and evening during these clear, cold days, but in beautiful, bright sunshine" [...] resulting in five canvases above the three he completed earlier in the year. He wrote to his brother, Theo, [...] "What I <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> a rather hard and coarse reality beside their abstractions, but it will have a rustic quality and will smell of the earth." [...] Rather than attempting to recreate what the scene might have been like, he explained [...] "one can express anguish without making reference to the actual Gethsemane, and... {{there is no need to}} portray figures from the Sermon on the Mount in order to express a gentle and comforting feeling." [...] He also commented: [...] "I shall not paint a Christ in the Garden of Olives, but shall paint the olive harvest as one might see it today, and by giving the human figure its proper place in it, one might perhaps be reminded of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Gdańsk {{became the}} focal point of the strike movement. On 21 August 1980, Mieczysław Jagielski {{replaced}} Tadeusz Pyka to lead a Polish government commission which was negotiating with strikers there. The strikers were represented by the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee, which was demanding that the workers it represented be given better rights, including better rights to strike. On 26 August meeting with representatives of the strikers at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk, Jagielski promised that the right to strike would be added to a new law on the official trade unions of Poland. After 5 more days of difficult negotiations, a settlement was reached between the strikers and the government, known as the Gdańsk agreement. Norman Davies contends that Jagielski [...] "in the end realised that only two alternatives remained -either agreement on the strikers' terms or an immediate resort to force for which the government was not prepared." [...] The agreement, as well as giving the workers of the Lenin Shipyard the right to strike, also allowed them to form their own independent trade union. Jagielski said of the negotiations that led to the agreement, [...] "We have spoken as Poles to Poles...There are no winners and losers. The important thing here is that we have understood each other and the best guarantee for what we <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> hard work." [...] He was reported to have spoken eloquently.|$|E

2500|$|Also in 1943, [...] "out of {{frustration}} over American policy, and outrage at Hollywood's fear of offending its European markets", he organized {{and wrote a}} pageant, We Will Never Die, which was produced by Billy Rose and Ernst Lubitsch, {{and with the help}} of composer Kurt Weill and staging by Moss Hart. The pageant was performed at Madison Square Garden for two shows in front of 40,000 people in March 1943. It then traveled nationwide, including a performance at the Hollywood Bowl. Hecht was disappointed nonetheless. As Weill noted afterward, [...] "The pageant has accomplished nothing. Actually, all we <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> make a lot of Jews cry, which is not a unique accomplishment." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 22, 2008 the President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, {{called on}} the world to legalize drugs, in order, he said, to prevent the {{majority}} of violent murders occurring in Honduras. Honduras is used by cocaine smugglers as a transiting point between Colombia and the US. Honduras, {{with a population of}} 7 million, suffers an average of 8–10 murders a day, with an estimated 70% being a result of this international drug trade. The same problem is occurring in Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Mexico, according to Zelaya. In January 2012 Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos made a plea to the United States and Europe to start a global debate about legalizing drugs. This call was echoed by the Guatemalan President Otto Pérez Molina, who announced his desire to legalize drugs, saying [...] "What I <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> put the issue back on the table." ...|$|E
2500|$|What Hipparchus may <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> {{transform}} {{these records}} to the Egyptian calendar, {{which uses a}} fixed year of always 365 days (consisting of 12 months of 30 days and 5 extra days): this makes computing time intervals much easier. Ptolemy dated all observations in this calendar. He also writes that [...] "All that he (=Hipparchus) did {{was to make a}} compilation of the planetary observations arranged in a more useful way" [...] (Almagest IX.2). [...] Pliny states (Naturalis Historia II.IX(53)) on eclipse predictions: [...] "After their time (=Thales) the courses of both stars (=Sun and Moon) for 600 years were prophesied by Hipparchus, …". [...] This seems to imply that Hipparchus predicted eclipses for a period of 600 years, but considering the enormous amount of computation required, this is very unlikely. Rather, Hipparchus would have made a list of all eclipses from Nabonasser's time to his own.|$|E

[...] He later told Lyell that [...] "Having burnt my own fingers so consumedly with the Wealden, I am fearful for you", and advised caution: [...] "for Heaven-sake take care of your fingers; to burn them severely, as I <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> <b>is</b> very unpleasant." [...] The third edition, as published on 30 April 1861, stated [...] "The computation of time required for the denudation of the Weald omitted.

2500|$|A {{month before}} Don 2s release Nariman Films, {{producers}} of Don, sent a legal notice to Reliance and Excel Entertainment about the sequel.

The producers replied, [...] "Whatever we <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> legal, so the claim is false {{and so are the}} charges. This is an absolutely new film and there is no question of a delay in releasing Don 2." [...] Khan added in an interview with Mumbai Mirror, [...] "While my producers are best qualified to give a fitting reply to the whole matter, I as a lead actor can say that as for the sequel, the Amitabh Bachchan Don never had a sequel. So where is the question of us copying anything. Farhan and his team have worked on the script, I {{know for a fact that}} we haven't copied from anywhere and this is an original script." [...] On 19 December, a week before Don 2s release, the Bombay High Court refused to stay the film's release.

2500|$|The {{announcement}} of a new purported clean source of energy came at a crucial time: adults still remembered the 1973 oil crisis and the problems caused by oil dependence, anthropogenic global warming was starting to become notorious, the anti-nuclear movement was labeling nuclear power plants as dangerous and getting them closed, people had in mind the consequences of strip mining, acid rain, the greenhouse effect and the Exxon Valdez oil spill, which happened {{the day after the}} announcement. In the press conference, Chase N. Peterson, Fleischmann and Pons, backed by the solidity of their scientific credentials, repeatedly assured the journalists that cold fusion would solve environmental problems, and would provide a limitless inexhaustible source of clean energy, using only seawater as fuel. They said the results had been confirmed dozens of times and they had no doubts about them. In the accompanying press release Fleischmann was quoted saying: [...] "What we <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> to open the door of a new research area, our indications are that the discovery will be relatively easy to make into a usable technology for generating heat and power, but continued work is needed, first, to further understand the science and secondly, to determine its value to energy economics." ...|$|E

[...] However, this stance is markedly different from the one taken by the American Indian Center up until recent years. In 2010, Joe Podlasek stated that, [...] "The stance is very clear. We want the Chicago Blackhawks logo to change. For us, that's one of our grandfathers. Would you do that with your grandfather's picture? Take it and throw it on a rug? Walk on it and dance on it?" [...] John Blackhawk, Chairman of the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, has suggested that the change in position may be tied to contributions the team has recently begun making to the center: [...] "We all do contributions, but we don't do it for the sake of wanting to be forgiven for something we've done that's offensive." ...|$|E
