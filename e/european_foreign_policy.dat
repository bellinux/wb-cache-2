5|$|As the {{composition}} is not precisely defined, some states {{which have a}} considerable division of executive power can {{find it difficult to}} decide who should attend the meetings. While an MEP, Alexander Stubb argued that {{there was no need for}} the President of Finland to attend Council meetings with or instead of the Prime Minister of Finland (who was head of <b>European</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy).</b> In 2008, having become Finnish Foreign Minister, Stubb was forced out of the Finnish delegation to the emergency council meeting on the Georgian crisis because the President wanted to attend the high-profile summit as well as the Prime Minister (only two people from each country could attend the meetings). This was despite Stubb being head of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe at the time which was heavily involved in the crisis. Problems also occurred in Poland where the President of Poland and the Prime Minister of Poland were of different parties and had a different foreign policy response to the crisis. A similar situation arose in Romania between President Traian Băsescu and Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu in 2007–2008 and again in 2012 with Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who both opposed the president.|$|E

500|$|The legal {{instruments}} {{used by the}} Council for the Common Foreign and Security Policy {{are different from the}} legislative acts. Under the CFSP they consist of [...] "common positions", [...] "joint actions", and [...] "common strategies". Common positions relate to defining a <b>European</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> towards a particular third-country such as the promotion of human rights and democracy in Myanmar, a region such as the stabilisation efforts in the African Great Lakes, or a certain issue such as support for the International Criminal Court. A common position, once agreed, is binding on all EU states who must follow and defend the policy, which is regularly revised. A joint action refers to a co-ordinated action of the states to deploy resources to achieve an objective, for example for mine clearing or to combat the spread of small arms. Common strategies defined an objective and commits the EUs resources to that task for four years.|$|E
