5|$|Kepler's primary {{obligation}} as imperial mathematician {{was to provide}} astrological advice to the emperor. Though Kepler took {{a dim view of}} the attempts of contemporary astrologers to precisely predict the future or divine specific events, he had been casting well-received detailed horoscopes <b>for</b> <b>friends,</b> family, and patrons since his time as a student in TÃ¼bingen. In addition to horoscopes for allies and foreign leaders, the emperor sought Kepler's advice in times of political trouble. Rudolph was actively interested in the work of many of his court scholars (including numerous alchemists) and kept up with Kepler's work in physical astronomy as well.|$|E

Samuel Pepys observed the conflagration from the Tower of London and recorded great concern <b>for</b> <b>friends</b> living on the bridge. There were fears that the flames would cross London Bridge to threaten the borough of Southwark on the south bank, but this danger was averted by an open space between buildings on the bridge which acted as a firebreak.|$|E

5|$|Sources {{from the}} time of the {{conclave}} listed up to twenty-one possible candidates considered by the cardinals, but the only ones that were seriously discussed during the conclave were Cesare Baronius and Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici. Baronius was the favourite candidate. His odds of being elected were 10:100 according to Roman bookmakers, who took bets on the election despite prohibition of the practice by Gregory XIV. Baronius received 23 votes during the first scrutiny, which was considered good because many electors who supported him had cast their first ballots <b>for</b> <b>friends.</b> Baronius was the candidate favoured by France, and had the backing of the French cardinals. He was also the first choice candidate of Pietro Aldobrandini, the nephew of Clement VIII, who sought to elect a cardinal who was created by his uncle such as Baronius.|$|E

5|$|At 12, Westenra {{entered a}} {{professional}} recording studio to record Walking in the Air, a demo album originally created <b>for</b> <b>friends</b> and family. At first, her parents paid for 70 copies; soon after, 1,000 more were cut for sale, hand-out, and publicity. After finishing her album, Westenra {{and her sister}} Sophie busked in Christchurch, giving away {{a few of the}} original 70 albums (at the behest of passersby) and selling some of the latter 1000. The pair drew large crowds, and one woman asked the girls if they had ever recorded anything. The woman, a journalist with Canterbury Television, asked Westenra to appear on air. Gray Bartlett, the director of a concert promotion company, saw the show and became interested in working with Westenra. Shortly after, she was offered a recording deal with Universal Records New Zealand. On that label, Westenra, who in the meantime was attending Burnside High School, released a self-titled album of show tunes and light classical songs, as well as My Gift to You, a CD of Christmas music. Following the success of her albums, she was offered and later received lessons from Dame Malvina Major.|$|E
5|$|Palomeque {{was found}} dead on August 22, 2009. His {{body was found in}} a river near the town of El Rosario, Sinaloa. According to a bus driver who was {{transporting}} Palomeque and other passengers to Mexico City on Friday night August 20, Palomeque became agitated, panicked and demanded to be let off the bus despite it being 1:30 in the morning. A text message he sent to his wife after leaving the bus confirms that Palomeque found himself lost on the dark hillside. After receiving the text message, his wife contacted local wrestling promoter Vicente Martinez, who organized a search party. On the morning of August 22, Palomeque was found floating face down in the river. Afterwards, medical expert JesÃºs Enrique Castro LÃ³pez stated that such an anxiety attack could be steroid related, but Palomeque's alleged steroid abuse has not been confirmed. An autopsy was carried out on August 23, which determined that {{the cause of death was}} drowning, and no further investigation into the death is planned. A memorial was held in Mexico City on August 24 <b>for</b> <b>friends</b> and family of Palomeque, many of whom showed up without their masks on, to keep the focus of the event on Palomeque. His body was subsequently cremated, with the ashes taken to Villahermosa to be buried.|$|E
