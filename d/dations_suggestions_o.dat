40|$|Pegging the {{exchange}} rate {{to the price of}} a main export commodity may be useful as an automatic adjustment mechanism in response to terms of trade shocks. This paper explores this idea for the oil exporting countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The paper simulates government finance deficits/surpluses and government consumption expenditure, under a hypothetical peg to oil prices and compares the results with other conventional pegs, such as a currency basket as well as a peg to the dollar, the current exchange rate regime in place. The results show that Kuwait could substantially decrease the volatility in its budget balance by adopting a peg which gives a 50 % weight to the price of oil. Using this exchange rate regime, Saudi Arabia could significantly reduce the volatility of its government consumption expenditure.

40|$|Mixtures of item {{response}} theory {{models have}} been proposed as a technique to explore response patterns in test data related to cognitive strategies, instructional sensitivity, and differential item functioning (DIF). Estimation proves challenging due to difficulties in identification and questions of effect size needed to recover underlying structures. In particular, the impact of auxiliary variables, or covariates, for examinees in estimation has not been systematically explored. The goal of this dissertation is {{to carry out a}} systematically designed simulation study to investigate the performance of mixture Rasch model (MRM) under Bayesian estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The dependent variables in this study are (1) the proportion of cases in which the generating mixture structure is recovered, and (2) among those cases in which the structure is recovered, the bias and root mean squared error of parameter estimates. The foci of the study are to use a flexible logistic regression model to parameterize the relation between latent class membership and the examinee covariate, to study MCMC estimation behavior in light of effect size, and to provide insights and <b>suggestions</b> <b>o...</b>|$|R
40|$|Query Refinement is an {{essential}} information retrieval tool that interactively recommends new terms related to a particular query. This paper introduces concept recall, an experimental measure of an algorithm's ability to suggest terms humans have judged to be semantically related to an information need. This study uses precision improvement experiments to measure the ability of an algorithm to produce single term query modifications that predict a user's information need as partially encoded by the query. An oracle algorithm produces ideal query modifications, providing a meaningful context for interpreting precision improvement results. This study also introduces RMAP, a fast and practical query refinement algorithm that refines multiple term queries by dynamically combining precomputed suggestions for single term queries. RMAP achieves accuracy comparable to a much slower algorithm, although both RMAP and the slower algorithm lag behind the best possible term <b>suggestions</b> <b>o</b> ered by the oracle.

40|$|This report {{focuses on}} the Exemplary Teacher Training Materials. The aim of these {{materials}} is to illustrate the teacher education Curriculum Design Principles and related Teacher Outcomes, which were developed during Work Package 5 as part of D 5. 2 Guidelines and Curricula for Teacher Training and {{can also be found}} in this report. They are designed for teacher educators to use in Initial Teacher Education (ITE) and teacher Continuing Professional Development (CPD). They aim to extend professional understanding and enhance professional development in order to foster creativity in science and mathematics education in the early years. This report explains the methodology used to develop the materials, the nature and structure of the materials and includes suggestions for their use in all phases of teacher education. Methodology used to develop the exemplary teacher training materials In the Creative Little Scientists project, the comparative research and the in-depth fieldwork in particular identified significant issues that need to be tackled in teacher education in order to foster creativity in science and mathematics education in the early years. Based on these issues the teacher education Content Design Principles, created during the curriculum design research, were refined, and a set of Teacher Outcomes developed. To produce the Exemplary Teacher Training Materials, classroom examples of creative learning and teaching were selected using these Content Design Principles and related Teacher Outcomes. All partners re-visited their data from the in-depth fieldwork (Work Package 4) to select pertinent images, interviews or classroom extracts that evidenced {{one or more of the}} Teacher Outcomes. To support and record the selection process a grid was provided where partners could record links between the fieldwork data selected, Teacher Outcomes and factors associated with creativity in learning and teaching in science and mathematics. Templates were then used to structure the classroom materials and provide consistent information about the contexts from which they were drawn. Teacher training materials: an overview and how to use them In total 169 templates are available containing exemplary materials from fieldwork for use in teacher education. These are structured in an Excel-file and can be found on the website [URL] In order to support the full use of this diverse range of resources for teacher training, suggestions are provided in this report of selection and use of these exemplary materials in relation to particular themes and associated Content Design Principles as follows: <b>o</b> <b>Suggestion</b> 1 : Use of questions and ideas of children by teachers (Principles 10 and 11) <b>o</b> <b>Suggestion</b> 2 : Resources and learning environment as essential context factors for Creativity and Inquiry (Principles 10, 14, 17) <b>o</b> <b>Suggestion</b> 3 : Focus on the nature of science – a link with creativity (Principle 3) <b>o</b> <b>Suggestion</b> 4 : Focus on Inquiry Based Science Education – link with creativity (Principle 6) <b>o</b> <b>Suggestion</b> 5 : Focus on Practical Investigations which foster creativity (Principles 2, 17) <b>o</b> <b>Suggestion</b> 6 : Collaboration/group work in inquiry and creativity based approaches (Principle 15) <b>o</b> <b>Suggestion</b> 7 : The role of play in inquiry and creativity based approaches (Principles 7, 8, 17) <b>o</b> <b>Suggestion</b> 8 : The use of the various modes of expression and representation of science and mathematics learning to support inquiry and the development of creativity – link with assessment (Principles 7, 9) <b>o</b> <b>Suggestion</b> 9 : The role of the teacher in Inquiry and Creativity approaches (Principles 1, 7, 11) <b>o</b> <b>Suggestion</b> 10 : Cross curricular project work to foster inquiry and creativity (Principle 6) The suggestions above are carefully chosen since they encourage inquiry and creativity in science and mathematics education for early years, by focusing on the synergies between Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE) and Creative Approaches (CA) : play and exploration; motivation and affect; dialogue and collaboration; problem solving and agency; questioning and curiosity; reflection and reasoning; teacher scaffolding and involvement; and assessment for learning.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the fast computation of a relation d on the edge set of connected graphs that plays a decisive role in the recognition of approximate Cartesian products, the weak reconstruction of Cartesian products, and the recognition of Cartesian graph bundles with a triangle free basis. A special case of d is the relation δ∗, whose convex closure yields the product relation σ that induces the prime factor decomposition of connected graphs with respect to the Cartesian product. For the construction of d so-called Partial Star Products are of particular interest. Several special data structures are used that allow to compute Partial Star Products in constant time. These computations are tuned to the recognition of approximate graph products, but also lead to a linear time algorithm for the computation of δ ∗ for graphs with maximum bounded degree. Furthermore, we define quasi Cartesian products as graphs with non-trivial δ∗. We provide several examples, and show that quasi Cartesian products can be recognized in linear time for graphs with bounded maximum degree. Finally, we note that quasi products can be recognized in sublinear time with a parallelized algorithm. ∗We thank Lydia Ostermeier for her insightful comments on graph bundles, {{as well as for the}} <b>suggestion</b> <b>o...</b>|$|R

A single-burst technique was used for reversion assay. Survival was lower at 45 degrees C than at 37 degrees C at a given extent of ethylation of bacteriophage DNA, confirming that events subsequent to ethylation, probably depurinations, are the main cause of decreased survival. Reversion was positively correlated (approximately linearly except at low extents at 37 degrees C) with ethylation of bacteriophage DNA, showing that ethylation itself causes mutation.

There is growing evidence that ozone, the concentration of which is continuously increasing and in many European region exceeds the threshold of toxicity for sensitive species, is involved in the genesis of this phenomenon. Recently, the similarities between O 3 -induced responses and the hypersensitive reactions induced by a pathogen attack, led to the <b>suggestion</b> that <b>O</b> 3 phytotoxicity could be the consequence of a cascade of events regulated by signaling molecules, interacting with each others in a rather complex manner and ultimately leading to the induction of defense responses or cell death. The present work was addressed at investigating the mechanisms of O 3 perception and some early responses carried out by the plant cell in an attempt to counteract its effects. Two poplar clones showing different sensitivity towards the pollutant as far as visible symptoms are concerned (I- 214 O 3 -resistant and Eridano O 3 -sensitive) were used as a model system. The obtained data let us to hypothesize that the major sensitivity shown by Eridano could derive from a marked H 2 O 2 accumulation and increase in salicylic acid content and ethylene evolution which were more pronounced than in I- 214. Thus, the O 3 - induced damage could be the consequence of an abnormal uncontrolled induction of metabolic pathways usually involved in the defensive response, the exaggerated and prolonged stimulation of which could lead to cell death...|$|R

We use this temporary {{shock to the}} cost of internal financing, and its variation across firms, to examine the role of capital constraints in the firm’s investment decisions. Controlling for the ability to repatriate foreign earnings in a more tax efficient way under the AJCA, we find that for a majority of firms there was little change in domestic investment – the policy objective of the law. We do find, however, that for the subset of firms which are capital constrained, they invested a majority of the repatriated funds in approved domestic investment. We find little change in financial policy (e. g. leverage and equity payouts) once we control for the ability to repatriate funds under the AJCA.

All the samples, including both nonmagnetic and magnetic portions, show essentially the same e 54 Cr deficit () 0. 77 ± 0. 10), relative to the terrestrial Cr standard. This contrasts with the variable positive 54 Cr anomalies observed for carbonaceous chondrites, but agrees with the values measured for eucrites, diogenites, and mesosiderites (Trinquier et al. 2007). This implies that, contrary to previous <b>suggestions</b> based on <b>O</b> isotopes, ureilites were not derived from any known carbonaceous chondrite parent body. Instead, the Almahata Sitta parent body may have accreted in a nebular region ⁄ environment {{similar to that of}} the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite (HED) parent body. In addition, the lack of variation in e 54 Cr combined with variable O isotopic compositions in the meteorite fragments suggests that whatever process(es) caused the O isotopic heterogeneity of the solar system was probably not responsible for heterogeneity in e 54 Cr. The samples show resolvable variations in e 53 Cr (0. 15 – 0. 41) that are correlated with Mn ⁄Cr ratios, suggesting that live 53 Mn was present at the time of formation of Almahata Sitta.

In particular firms whose number of bank lending relationships was reduced from 2 to 1 {{as a consequence of the}} merger have 23. 23 % higher probability of adding a new bank lending relationships within 5 years after the merger than similar firms unaffected by the merger. I also find that overall a reduction in the number of bank lenders as a consequence of the merger reduced the firm’s access to credit.

These lamellae are replaced by advanced embryo (AE) book lungs that continue into postembryonic stages. Results herein agree with earlier <b>suggestions</b> that the <b>O</b> 2 limb buds become the AE book lungs. Each O 2 limb bud merges with the ventral surface of the O 2 segment, where the limb bud/book lung is internalized by covering with epidermis. A strand of tissue (entapophysis) from the epidermis at the posterior opisthosoma provides precursor cells for the book lung lamellae, and possibly entapophysis cells induce limb bud cells to align and produce lamellae. Electron micrographs show the different modes (I–III) of lumen formation. The result is a spiracle, atrium and alternating air and hemolymph channels.

This result supports previous <b>suggestions</b> that low-δ^(18) <b>O</b> components to Mauna Kea lavas are contaminants derived from hydrothermally-altered rocks in the volcanic edifice or lithosphere, rather than components of the underlying mantle sources of these lavas. The slope of the correlation between δ^(18) O values and forsterite contents of olivines is steeper for subaerial Mauna Kea lavas than for submarine Mauna Kea lavas, and olivines from Mauna Loa lavas exhibit negligible changes in δ^(18) O values over a similar range of forsterite contents. Models of assimilation–fractional crystallization (AFC) processes can explain our observations if the δ^(18) O values of crustal contaminants decrease sharply at the submarine–subaerial transition in Mauna Kea volcano, and if Mauna Loa lavas are either uncontaminated or contaminated only by rocks that have δ^(18) O values similar to that of primary Mauna Loa magmas. We suggest that the differences in oxygen isotope systematics among Mauna Loa, submarine Mauna Kea and subaerial Mauna Kea lavas principally reflect the sources and amounts of water available to hydrothermal systems in the volcanic edifice...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a debate}} on the {{behavior}} of Re and Os during mantle metasomatism. Some argue that the mantle can acquire high 187 Os/ 188 Os (0. 15 to s 1. 0) either directly from metasomatic events or by the growth of 187 Os from 187 Re over time. However, any <b>suggestions</b> of subduction-related <b>Os</b> metasomatism producing whole-scale elevation of the mantle to 187 Os/ 188 Os values greater than 0. 15 need to be supported by comparisons of increased Re and Os concentrations and isotopic ratios, with like and consistent increases in elements (i. e., Ba, B, Rb) and isotopic ratios (i. e., Nd, Pb, Sr) known to be affected by metasomatic processes. All of the samples in the literature, either xenoliths or minerals (sulfides, pyroxene, phlogopite or amphibole) that are thought to represent the products of mantle metasomatism, follow a clear correlation of increasing Re/Os with decreasing Os concentration. This inverse correlation requires enrichment in Os concentrations in the metasomatizing agent by two to four orders of magnitude relative to the original subduction component in order to substantially elevate 187 Os/ 188 Os, eliminating sediment or slab melts as an effective metasomatic component. To date {{there is no evidence to}} support conclusions that Os metasomatism, either directly or by a two-stage process involving Re metasomatism and 187 Os growth over time, will substantially change the 187 Os/ 188 Os of the mantle to values s 0. 15. When other isotopic systems are considered along with Os, in metasomatism-based models, these models are not plausible. Consequently, large-scale mantle melts should reflect near-chondritic values. The recognition of the robustness of the Re^Os system will allow for the discrimination of different mantle and crustal reservoirs involved in magmatic processes...|$|R

Let GL(n, K) denote the multiplicative group of all non-singular nxn matrices with coefficients {{in a field}} K; SL(n, K) the subgroup of GL(n, K) consisting of all matrices with determinant unity; C(n, K) the centre of SL(n, K); PSL(n, K) the factor group SL(n, K) /C(n, K); I(n) the nxn identity matrix; GF(pn) the finite field with pn elements. We determine when every element of SL(n, K) is a commutator of SL(n, K) or of GL(n, K). Theorem 1. Let A [ [...] . ] SL(n, K). Then it follows that A is a commutator [ [...] . ] of SL(n, K) unless: (i) n = 2 and K = GF(2); (ii) n = 2 and K = GF(3); or (iii) K has characteristic zero and A = [ [...] . ] where a is a primitive nth root of unity in K and n [ [...] . ] 2 (mod 4). In case (i), SL(2, GF(2)) properly contains its commutator subgroup. In case (ii), SL(2, GF(3)) properly contains its commutator subgroup. Furthermore, every element of SL(2, GF(3)) is a commutator of GL(2, GF(3)). In case (iii), [ [...] . ] is always a commutator of GL(n, K). Moreover, aIn is a commutator of SL(n, K) when, and only when, the equation - 1 = x 2 + y 2 has a solution x, y [ [...] . ] K. Hence: Theorem 2. Whenever PSL(n, K) is simple, every element of PSL(n, K) is a commutator of PSL(n, K). Theorem 1 simplifies and extends results due to K. Shoda (Jap. J. Math., 13 (1936), p. 361 - 365; J. Math.

40|$|The {{numerical}} {{modeling of}} turbulent flows over rough walls {{is one of}} the most important issues in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The presen ce of roughness adds more difficulties and uncertainties. Roughness is p resent in most of the cases in nature like rivers, channels and coastal waters; therefore, it has to be characterized to be accounted for in mod elling works, avoiding the use of more expensive techniques with respect to the computational point of view. Thus, the main scope of the present doctoral research is the characterization of the roughness in open-chan nel flows and the proposal of new approaches to simulate flow over rough walls avoiding the use of computationally expensive methods to be appli ed under clear and sediment-laden flow. Therefore, the characterization of the roughness should be complemented by the use of proper turbulence models which take into account the flow processes near to bottom surfaces e. g. low-Reynolds turbulence mod els. This is done considering that turbulence is present in most of the flow processes, especially over irregular surfaces. Thus, the most prope r turbulence models found in literature are two-layer turbulence models, which are a combination of two approaches, the standard transport equat ions for the turbulent quantities far from the wall, and the use of alge braic or empirical approaches close to the wall, in order to reduce the demand of finer numerical grids close to irregular surfaces. Following, two-layer turbulence models are assessed and applied to flow over rough bottoms in order to determine their advantages and limitation s of their performance. The main limitation of current two-layer turbule nce models proposed in literature is the proper simulation of turbulent quantities close to the bottom with the presence of protrusions or rough ness. Therefore, a new two-layer turbulence model for flow over rough bo ttoms is developed and proposed. This model will overcome the limitation s of current two-layer models and can be applied in clear water and sedi ment-laden flows. For this purpose LES (Large Eddy Simulation) data gene rated from simulations of flow over wavy walls developed at the Vrije Un iversiteit Brussel are applied for the development of the new model. The n, the proposed model is calibrated with the LES (Large Eddy Simulation) data reproducing the asymptotic behavior of turbulent quantities near t he wall and its variation due to roughness. The proposed model is tested and applied to DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation) and experimental cases of open-channel flow over rough bottoms under clear water conditions. Finally, the presence of sediments in suspension will add more complexit ies that should need to be considered in modeling works. Therefore, the proposed model is applied to an experimental case of sediment-laden flow to simulate the observed data. In this type of flow cases, it is necess ary to take into account that the presence of sediment particles at the bottom surface will (in the case of sand) increase the roughness and the sediments in suspension will increase the resistance to flow. In conclusion, the contributions proposed in the present research lead t <b>o</b> <b>suggestions</b> for further research work on the effects of sediments and rough walls on turbulent open-channel flow, even considering the presenc e of mobile beds, and more complex conditions. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{case-control study}} of {{malignant}} and non-malignant respiratory disease among {{employees of the}} Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation's Newark, Ohio plant was undertaken. The aim {{was to determine the}} extent to which exposures to substances in the Newark plant environment, to non-workplace factors, or to a combination may play a part in the risk of mortality from respiratory disease among workers in this plant. A historical environmental reconstruction of the plant was undertaken to characterise the exposure profile for workers in this plant from its beginnings in 1934 to the end of 1987. The exposure profile provided estimates of cumulative exposure to respirable fibres, fine fibres, asbestos, talc, formaldehyde, silica, and asphalt fumes. Employment histories from Owens-Corning Fiberglas provided information on employment characteristics (duration of employment, year of hire, age at first hire) and an interview survey obtained information on demographic characteristics (birthdate, race, education, marital state, parent's ethnic background, and place of birth), lifetime residence, occupational and smoking histories, hobbies, and personal and family medical history. Matched, unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) were used to assess the association between lung cancer or non-malignant respiratory disease and the cumulative exposure history, demographic characteristics, and employment variables. Only the smoking variables and employment characteristics (year of hire and age at first hire) were statistically significant for lung cancer. For non-malignant respiratory disease, only the smoking variables were statistically significant in the univariate analysis. Of the variables entered into a conditional logistic regression model for lung cancer, only smoking (smoked for six months or more v never smoked: OR = 26. 17, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 3. 316 - 206. 5) and age at first hire (35 and over v less than 35 : OR = 0. 244, 95 % CI 0. 083 - 0. 717) were statistically significant. There were, however, increased ORs for year of employment (first hired before 1945 v first hire after 1945 : OR = 1. 944, 95 % CI 0. 850 - 4. 445), talc (cumulative exposure > 1000 fibres/ml days v never exposed: OR = 1. 355, 95 % CI 0. 407 - 5. 515), and asphalt fumes (cumulative exposure > 0. 01 mg/m(3) days v never exposed: OR 1. 131, 95 % CI 0. 468 - 2. 730). For non-malignant respiratory disease, only the smoking variable was significant in the conditional logistic regression analysis (OR = 2. 637, 95 % CI 1. 146 - 6. 069). There were raised ORs for the higher cumulative exposure categories for respirable fibres, asbestos, silica, and asphalt fumes. For both silica and asphalt fumes, ORs were more than double the reference groups for all exposure categories. A limited number of subjects were exposed to fine fibres. The scarcity of cases and controls limits the extent to which analyses for fine fibre may be carried out. Within those limitations, among those who had worked with fine fibre, the unadjusted, unmatched OR for lung cancer was (1. 0 (95 % CI 0. 229 - 4. 373) and for non-malignant respiratory disease, the OR was 1. 5 (95 % CI 0. 336 - 6. 702). The unadjusted OR for lung cancer for exposure to fine fibre was consistent with that for all respirable fibre and does not suggest an association. For non-malignant respiratory disease, the unadjusted OR for fine fibre was opposite in direction from that for all respirable fibres. Within the limitations of the available data on fibre, there is <b>o</b> <b>suggestion</b> that exposure to fine fibre has resulted in an increase in risk of lung cancer. The increased OR for non-malignant respiratory disease is inconclusive. The results of this population, in this place and time, neither respirable fibres nor any of the substances investigated as part of the plant environment are statistically significant factors for lung cancer risk although there are increased ORs for exposure to talc and asphalt fumes. Smoking is the most important factors in risk for lung cancer in this population. The situation is less clear for non-malignant respiratory disease. Unlike lung cancer, non-malignant respiratory represents a constellation of outcomes and not a single well defined end point. Although smoking was the only statistically significant factor for non-malignant respiratory disease in this analysis, the ORs for respirable fibres, asbestos, silica, and asphalt fumes were greater than unity for the highest exposure categories. Although the raised ORs for these substances may represent the results of a random process, they may be suggestive of an increased risk and require further investigation...|$|R
