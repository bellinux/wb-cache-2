5|$|Although {{the most}} {{powerful}} <b>individual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with {{the concerns of the}} plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29BC, Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon. He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities. In 28BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.|$|E
5|$|P.exclamans {{tend to have}} smaller nests {{than other}} wasps, with {{typically}} fewer than one hundred individuals in a given nest. Because {{of the size of}} the nest, the queen tends to be the most active <b>individual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nest. This is because the queen has to monitor and directly control the activities of the nest. In addition to her reproductive role, the queen must also act as the pacemaker of the nest and synchronize the worker activity. These last two points have recently been disputed and the workers may be self organized. It has also been observed that the queen will act aggressively towards individuals that are the least active.|$|E

5|$|The Regency Acts {{allow for}} regencies {{in the event}} of a monarch who is a minor or who is {{physically}} or mentally incapacitated. When a regency is necessary, the next qualified <b>individual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> line of succession automatically becomes regent, unless they themselves are a minor or incapacitated. Special provisions were made for Queen Elizabeth II by the Regency Act 1953, which stated that the Duke of Edinburgh (the Queen's husband) could act as regent in these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|The {{passenger}} pigeon was exceptional {{for a number}} of reasons. In modern times, it is the only pigeon species that was not an island species to have become extinct even though it was once the most numerous species of bird on Earth. Its former numbers are difficult to estimate, but one ornithologist, Alexander Wilson, estimated one flock he observed contained over two billion birds. The decline of the species was abrupt; in 1871, a breeding colony was estimated to contain over a hundred million birds, yet the last <b>individual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> species was dead by 1914. Although habitat loss was a contributing factor, the species is thought to have been massively over-hunted, being used as food for slaves and, later, the poor, in the United States throughout the 19thcentury.|$|E

5|$|Żółkiewski's {{popularity}} waned in {{the latter}} years of his career. He was accused of not supporting Samuel Korecki {{during the battle of}} Sasowy Róg in 1616, of signing the Treaty of Jaruga (Busza) in 1617 which relinquished influence in some borderlands to Moldova and the Ottoman Empire; and of failing to stop the Tatars at the battle of Orynin in 1618. But in 1618 he finally received his coveted buława of the Grand Crown Hetman, and shortly afterwards the office of Grand Crown Chancellor. He was thus for a brief period the most powerful <b>individual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth after the king, a position he reached not through wealth or family but by military achievement and reputation.|$|E
5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was also}} adopted {{as a method}} of execution by Guatemala in 1996, China in 1997, the Philippines in 1999, Thailand in 2003, Taiwan in 2005, and Vietnam in 2013. The Philippines abolished the method in 2006, though a bill to reinstate it passed through the House of Representatives and as of July 2017 is still awaiting debate in the Senate. While it is still legal, no executions have been carried out in Guatemala since 2000, and in Thailand since 2009. The United States and China are the two biggest users of this method of execution. The U.S. had executed 1,283 people via lethal injection as of April 2017. The number of people executed annually in China is thought to surpass all other countries combined, though the actual number is a state secret, and the percentage of people killed via lethal injection and the other method of execution used there, firing squad, is also unclear. This alphabetical list features notable cases up to September 2017, and only those where lethal injection can be reliably sourced to be the method of execution. The criterion for notability is an article on the <b>individual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English Wikipedia, which inevitably causes a bias towards U.S. executions, as notable individuals in other countries such as Thailand and Vietnam may only have articles in their own language. A complete list of all executions in the United States can be found here.|$|E
5|$|Tidus makes few {{appearances}} in {{the plot of the}} 2003 sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, although meeting him is the player's objective. Two years after the events of Final Fantasy X, Yuna sees a sphere with a young man (resembling Tidus) trapped in a prison. She joins the Gullwings, a sphere-hunting group, and travels around Spira in the hope of finding more clues that Tidus is alive. The <b>individual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sphere is later revealed as Shuyin. Depending on the player's development during the game, the fayth will appear to Yuna at the end and tell her that they can make Tidus return to her. He then appears in Spira, and he and Yuna are reunited. In another final scene, Tidus (unsure whether or not he is still a dream) wants to remain with Yuna. He is also an unlockable character as Star Player, a blitzball player. In Final Fantasy X-2: International + Last Mission (the game's updated version), Tidus is a playable character for battles. An extra episode, set after the original game's play-through, reveals that he is living in Besaid with Yuna. An illusion of Tidus also appears as a boss character.|$|E
