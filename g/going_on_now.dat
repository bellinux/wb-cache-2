25|$|Since the Zapatista {{uprising}} in 1994, {{the city has}} developed a type of cult tourism focusing around the EZLN. This tourism attracts those interested in both leftist political beliefs and indigenous activism who come {{to see where the}} events of the 1990s happened as well as what is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>now.</b> This tourism has spurred the creation of Zapatista-themed shops which sell EZLN shirts and other souvenirs. This tourism has been given the name of “Zapaturismo” or “Zapatourism”. The term originally was derogatory and referred to the large number of leftist activists which converged on the city after the EZLN uprising began. Since then, the term receives mixed reviews with some finding humor in it.|$|E
500|$|The artwork for The Blackening was {{designed}} by Robb Flynn, longtime Machine Head collaborator Paul Brown, and Deanna Alcorn. Based on a metal carving in the 16th century, these carvings were used to scare people about going to Hell and for propaganda purposes. It features a skeleton on a throne that is standing {{on top of the}} world, and the words [...] "The mirror which flatters not." [...] Flynn thought [...] "this whole record is like holding up a mirror to ourselves. It's talking about things that are <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>now,</b> but it's not necessarily specific to this time." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Amber 31422" [...] was {{watched by}} an {{estimated}} 4.97 million viewers in the United States. The episode had a season low rating of 1.8/5 among viewers 18–49, which was down 10% {{from the previous}} episode that aired on October 14. Between Fringe and its lead-in show Bones, Fox finished in third place for the night. The Fringe episode's low ratings have been attributed by critics to the unexpected end to the 2010 World Series, which caused Fringe to air a week earlier than expected. Den of Geek columnist Billy Grifter attributed the low ratings to the parallel universe focus, commenting [...] "if you weren't a fan beforehand, you'll {{not be able to}} follow what's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>now.</b> For those of us that did step onto the Fringe elevator early, it's a great ride, but I can see that it's a difficult proposition to attract new viewers." [...] Time shifted viewing increased the episode's ratings by 44 percent among adults, resulting in a rise from 1.8 to 2.6.|$|E

500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If {{they want to}} get married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' it makes me sick to my stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none of my business if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white. [...] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We have a thing <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>now,</b> people discriminating against homosexuality in this country. I love the homosexuality people. God bless the gay people. They are great people." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} presidents have issued {{responses}} to these events. One of them, Presbyterian College president John Griffith, compared this movement {{to a form of}} revolution: [...] "I have lived long enough to {{come to the conclusion that}} major shifts occur every quarter century or so in the way American culture approaches matters of importance. We often call those shifts revolutions because people revolt against old and outmoded ways of doing things in favor of new approaches, new technologies and new ideas that better meet the needs of the time. We have experienced revolutions in information technology, travel and communication. There is one <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>now</b> that is symbolized by the introduction of iPhones this past week; we know what this one is about. But there is another revolution going on related to choosing a college -- and the role that public rankings play in that choice -- that may be less clear." ...|$|E

We’re not trying to say this is the song, but it’s a story and we wanted to talk about what is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> right <b>now.</b> Thank you is a sarcastic way of saying you know what," [...] — Oller about the song's content. [...] "Thank You" [...] is a pop rap and teen pop song with a length of three minutes and forty-nine seconds. It is written in the key of B major. Lyrically, it is a sarcastically-written approach on the world's issues and a sarcastic gratitude to the previous generation.|$|R
