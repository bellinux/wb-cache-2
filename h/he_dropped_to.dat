5|$|The {{victory was}} Häkkinen's {{first of the}} season, and put him into {{second place in the}} World Drivers' Championship, {{fourteen}} points behind Michael Schumacher. Coulthard's second-place finish meant that <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> third, and Barrichello third place moved him ahead of Ralf Schumacher. In the World Constructors' Championship, McLaren's one-two finish allowed them to move within seven points from leaders Ferrari. Williams remained in third on 15 points, with twelve races remaining in the season.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} laps, Massa {{appeared}} to have a faster car than Hamilton, and repeatedly tried to pass the McLaren {{on the inside of}} turn four. His first attempt was on lap three, but Hamilton braked late and kept ahead of Massa into the following corner. Massa tried again at the same place on the next two laps. He passed Hamilton briefly into the turn on lap five, but overshot the corner and ran wide onto the grass. <b>He</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> fifth, behind teammate Räikkönen and BMW's Nick Heidfeld. Hamilton apologised after the race for 'tricking' Massa into the move. Albers, in the sole remaining Spyker, retired on lap nine with a gearbox fire.|$|E
5|$|The result meant Hamilton {{extended}} his lead over Button in the World Drivers' Championship to six points. Vettel's victory {{allowed him to}} move from fifth to third, 12 points behind Hamilton. Webber's retirement meant that <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> fourth, while Alonso's eighth-place finish resulted in him moving from fourth to fifth. McLaren increased their advantage over Red Bull in the Constructors' Championship to be 30 points ahead. Ferrari remained in third place, while Renault reduced the points deficit to Mercedes {{in the battle for}} fourth place.|$|E

He reached the final of the Ruhr Championship, but lost 2–4 against John Higgins. Murphy finished 1st on the Players Tour Championship Order of Merit, couldn't defend his Premier League Snooker title, as he lost 1–7 against Ronnie O'Sullivan in the final. He then reached the semi-finals of the 2010 UK Championship, where he lost to eventual runner-up Mark Williams 8–9.|$|E
5|$|Around 5:30a.m. on December 15, 39 police {{officers}} and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull's house. They surrounded the house, knocked and entered. Lt. Bull Head told Sitting Bull that he was under arrest and led him outside. Sitting Bull and his wife noisily stalled for time, the camp awakened and men converged at the house. As Lt. Bullhead ordered Sitting Bull to mount a horse, he said the Indian Affairs agent needed to see the chief, and then he could return to his house. When Sitting Bull refused to comply, the police used force on him. The Sioux in the village were enraged. Catch-the-Bear, a Lakota, shouldered his rifle and shot Lt. Bullhead, who reacted by firing his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull. Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the head, and <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> the ground. He died between 12 and 1 p.m.|$|E
5|$|Although Roberts {{won four}} Grand Nationals in 1976, he {{continued}} to experience mechanical misfortunes {{as well as a}} horsepower deficit to the Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the mile and half-mile dirt track events. He had been leading the Daytona 200 once again when tire troubles forced him to make a lengthy pit stop, and Johnny Cecotto {{went on to win the}} race. <b>He</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> third in the national championship as Jay Springsteen claimed the title for the Harley-Davidson team. He returned to England in April 1977, winning four out of six races at the 1977 Transatlantic Match races. Roberts then travelled to Italy where he raced in the Imola 200, leaving no doubt he was capable of competing at the international level by winning both legs and setting a new track record. He returned to the United States to compete in the Grand National championship where he won five of the six road races that made up the pavement portion of the series. In the road race event at Sears Point, Roberts started the race at the back of the pack and passed the entire field within four laps to win the race. Despite being in contention for much of the season, Roberts was unable to win any of the dirt track events and eventually finished the year in fourth place.|$|E

5|$|By his standards, Roger Federer had a weak season: {{he failed}} to win a Grand Slam tournament title {{for the first time}} since 2002, losing to Nadal for the fourth time in a French Open final, and the sixth time overall in Major finals. <b>He</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> world No. 4 in November, the first time he had been ranked outside the top 3 since 2002. Federer's drop was caused by Murray's {{remarkable}} run of form in Asia in October, winning three successive titles. However, Federer rallied, winning his three final tournaments (a sign of things to come in the subsequent season), including the World Tour Finals, which was enough to secure an end-of-season ranking of No. 3. Murray, meanwhile, was making significant improvements to his game and made the semifinals of all four Grand Slam tournaments, with his best result a defeat in the Australian Open final against Djokovic. He ended the year with two ATP World Tour Masters 1000 titles for the fourth consecutive year, and five titles in total.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland rebounded {{from its}} first {{loss of the}} season with a 31–28 victory over the Rockets. The game started slow; Groza's 21-yard field goal was the only score in the first quarter. The Rockets then went ahead by scoring a {{touchdown}} on a long pass from quarterback Vacanti to end Elroy Hirsch. Cleveland, however, piled on the points as Motley ran for a touchdown in the second quarter and Speedie caught a pass from Graham in the third. Jones added two touchdown runs in the fourth quarter, giving Cleveland a 31–14 lead. Chicago almost caught {{up at the end of}} the game, scoring two touchdowns, but the Browns held on to win. Cleveland's third-string players were on the field in the closing minutes when Chicago made its final push. Rockets rookie Ray Ramsey had three touchdowns in the game. Graham had 239 passing yards on 10 completions. Speedie caught half of them, gaining 166 yards. His touchdown came after <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> the ground to grab a 17-yard pass from Graham. He faked a backward lateral while on the ground, which drew Chicago's defense away from him, and then got up and ran into the end zone.|$|E
5|$|On special teams, Robbie Gould tied {{his team}} {{record for the}} highest field goal {{percentage}} with 89.7 by converting 26 of 29 field goals. Gould also became the second player in franchise history to reach 1,000 career points during the season. However, punter Adam Podlesh ranked 33rd {{in the league in}} gross average punting yards with 40.6. In comparison with his 2012 stats, Podlesh was 18th in the league in net punting average with 39.4 yards, 34 punts landing inside the 20-yard line with 6 touchbacks. In 2013, <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> 29th in the former category with 37.9 yards, 27 punts inside the 20 and four fewer touchbacks. The punting corps also ranked last in the league in gross punting with 40 yards. In the return game, Devin Hester led the league in kickoff return yards with 1,442 and was fifth in kickoff return average with 27.7 yards. Linebacker Blake Costanzo led all Bears gunners with 17 tackles. Cornerback Sherrick McManis ranked second with 15, followed by safety Craig Steltz (14), receiver Eric Weems (13) and safety Anthony Walters (10). Ultimately, the Bears' special teams ranked 23rd in the NFL, leading the league in kickoff coverage after allowing 18.7 yards per return.|$|E

5|$|Willkie {{spent much}} of 1943 {{preparing}} for a second presidential run, addressing Republican and nonpartisan groups. He did not meet with Roosevelt; with the presidential election approaching and with both men likely to run in it as candidates, their continued association would have been awkward. Although they differed with him on many issues, Republican leaders recognized Willkie's appeal and they had wanted him to campaign for the party in the 1942 midterm elections, but he went around the world instead. The huge publicity received by the titular head of the Republican Party as an emissary for a Democratic president frustrated leading Republicans. In spite of this, the Republicans gained seats in both the House and the Senate, though they still remained in the minority. Few Republican members of Congress were by then willing to support Willkie, and <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> second place behind General Douglas MacArthur in polls of likely voters in the party's 1944 presidential primaries. By 1943, even liberal Democrats did not doubt Willkie's progressive credentials. He spoke of appointing an African American to either the cabinet or the Supreme Court, and he warned California's Republican committee that the New Deal was irreversible and he stated that all they would get by opposing it was oblivion.|$|E
5|$|The {{qualifying}} session held on Saturday {{afternoon was}} split into three parts. The first part ran for 20 minutes and eliminated the cars from qualifying that finished the session 18th or lower. The {{second part of}} qualifying lasted 15 minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to 17. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race, and as such started the race on the tyres that they set their quickest lap on. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Webber set the fastest time in the final part of the session, which clinched him his third successive pole position with a lap of 1:26.295. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Hamilton, who recorded a lap time 0.148 seconds slower. Vettel set the fastest times in the first two qualifying sessions, but made mistakes on his first two runs due to a roll-bar failure in the final session which prevented him from recording a faster lap. <b>He</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> third overall in the final part of qualifying. Button made an error in his car set-up which caused him to run too low to the ground through turn eight which restricted him to fourth place. Schumacher qualified in fifth and was happy with his starting position despite spinning at turn eight on his final qualifying lap. Rosberg qualified sixth and despite wanting to start higher up the field, he was confident about his race chances.|$|E

In the race, he finished 14th.|$|E
25|$|Ančić started {{training}} in June with his Swedish coach Fredrik Rosengren. After he withdrew from two tournaments in July, Ančić returned in August at the Canada Masters and the Cincinnati Masters, where he {{lost in the}} second rounds.
