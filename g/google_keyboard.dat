50|$|Android devices support emoji {{differently}} {{depending on}} the operating system version. Google added native emoji support to Android in July 2013 with Android 4.3, and to the <b>Google</b> <b>Keyboard</b> in November 2013 for devices running Android 4.4 and later. Android 7.0 Nougat added Unicode 9 emoji, skin tone modifiers, and a redesign of many existing emoji. Emoji are also supported by the Google Hangouts application (independent of the keyboard in use), in both Hangouts and SMS modes. Several third-party messaging and keyboard applications (such as IQQI Keyboard) for Android devices provide plugins that allow the use of emoji.|$|E
40|$|Keyboards are the {{dominant}} Input Method Editors (IMEs) used for data input into computers. With {{the rise of}} mobile devices with touchscreen technologies, soft keyboards, also called on screen or virtual keyboards, have become popular. The keyboard layout decides the data entry rate, user friendliness, and accuracy of data input. This study assesses ten soft keyboards in the Kannada language {{with respect to their}} utility for interaction with OPAC. EazyType Kannada and <b>Google</b> <b>Keyboard</b> were found to be better than others in terms of number of keystrokes required to input data. Anova and Standard deviation techniques were used to analyse the data. This study has an implication for users of OPAC in deciding the keyboard to be used on their mobile devices...|$|E
50|$|Some {{examples}} of phonetic transliterators are Xlit, Google Indic Transliteration, BarahaIME, Indic IME, Rupantar, SMC's Indic Keyboard and Microsoft Indic Language Input Tool. SMC's Indic Keyboard has support {{for as many}} as 23 languages whereas <b>Google</b> Indic <b>Keyboard</b> only supports 11 Indian languages.|$|R
40|$|Date of Acceptance: 15 / 12 / 2014 We present VelociTap: a {{state-of-the-art}} touchscreen keyboard decoder that supports a sentence-based text entry approach. VelociTap enables users to seamlessly choose from three word-delimiter actions: pushing a space key, swiping to the right, or simply omitting the space key {{and letting the}} decoder infer spaces automatically. We demonstrate that VelociTap has a significantly lower error rate than <b>Google's</b> <b>keyboard</b> while retaining the same entry rate. We show that intermediate visual feedback does not significantly affect entry or error rates and we find that using the space key results in the most accurate results. We also demonstrate that enabling flexible word-delimiter options does not incur an error rate penalty. Finally, we investigate how small {{we can make the}} keyboard when using VelociTap. We show that novice users can reach a mean entry rate of 41 wpm on a 40 mm wide smartwatch-sized keyboard at a 3 % character error rate. Postprin...|$|R

It will be the Siemens' second smartphone after SX1 which was unveiled {{more than a decade}} ago. It was announced in February 2016. Gigaset does not use <b>Google's</b> standard <b>keyboard</b> but installs the popular alternative [...] "SwiftKey". The Gigaset ME is a dual-SIM smartphone.|$|R

Apple's iOS 8.0 and later has {{the option to}} install onscreen keyboards from the App Store, which includes several free and paid Dvorak layouts. iOS 4.0 and later supports external Dvorak <b>keyboards.</b> <b>Google's</b> Android OS touchscreen keyboard can use Dvorak and other nonstandard layouts natively as of version 4.1.|$|R
40|$|Part 3 : Assistive Technology for Blind UsersInternational audienceThough several {{keyboards}} for Indic {{languages are}} available on Android Play store, few are accessible by the visually impaired. Particularly, none of the gesture-based keyboards are accessible. We developed an accessible prototype of the popular gesture-based, logically organised Hindi keyboard Swarachakra. In this paper, we present findings from a two-part study. In the first part, we conducted a qualitative study with 12 visually impaired users on Swarachakra. In the second part, we conducted a longitudinal, within-subject evaluation comparing Swarachakra and <b>Google</b> Indic <b>keyboard.</b> At {{the end of the}} two-week long study, 10 participants had spent an average of 6. 5  h typing, including training and text input tasks. Our study establishes benchmark for text input speeds for Indic languages on virtual keyboards by visually impaired users. The mean typing speed on Swarachakra was 14. 53  cpm and that on Google Indic was 12. 79  cpm. The mean speeds in last session were 21. 72  cpm and 18. 36  cpm respectively. Regression analysis indicates that the effect of keyboard was significant. In addition, we report the user preferences, the challenges faced and qualitative findings that are relevant to future research in Indic language text input by visually impaired users...|$|R
5000|$|HJKL is a layout {{used in the}} Unix {{computer}} world, {{a practice}} spawned by its use in the vi text editor. The editor was written by Bill Joy for use on an Lear-Siegler ADM-3A terminal, which places arrow symbols on these letters since, like the original Mac shown above, {{it did not have}} dedicated arrow keys on the keyboard. These correspond to the functions of the corresponding control characters , , , and [...] when sent to the terminal, moving the cursor left, down, up, and right, respectively. [...] (The [...] and [...] functions were standard, but the interpretations of [...] and [...] were unique to the ADM-3A.) This key arrangement {{is often referred to as}} [...] "vi keys". HJKL keys are still ubiquitous in newly developed Unix software even though today's keyboards have arrow keys. They have the advantage of letting touch-typists move the cursor without taking their fingers off of the home row. Examples of games that use HJKL are the text-based [...] "graphic" [...] adventures like NetHack, the Rogue series, and Linley's Dungeon Crawl. It is also used by some players of the Dance Dance Revolution clone StepMania, where HJKL corresponds directly to the order of the arrows. Gmail, <b>Google</b> labs' <b>keyboard</b> shortcuts and other websites use J and K for [...] "next" [...] and [...] "previous".|$|R
