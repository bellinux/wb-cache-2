40|$|Sustainable {{manufacturing}} {{is essential}} for a future green economy. Due to its nonspecific phrasing its prospects are, however, heavily weakened. Thus the concept of ultra-efficiency was developed recently as a vision of future manufacturing systems. Based on a unique system model, five key spheres of action and two enabling technologies, prospective production environments are expected to eliminate waste and emissions thoroughly. Yet, present manufacturing companies mostly experience a lack of <b>position</b> <b>reckoning</b> to begin with. In this paper we hence present a tailored approach for sustainable <b>position</b> <b>reckoning</b> and operational improvement at different organizational layers using Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, Sustainability Balanced Scorecard, Material Flow Cost Accounting and Life Cycle Assessment. The concept was successfully tested in four manufacturing companies in Germany proving extensive transparency gain and organizational improvement...|$|R

40|$|Direct optical images (Bessel V, R and Gunn i; average seeing of 0. 88 seconds) of B 1422 + 231, {{obtained}} in March 1993 at European Southern Observatory (ESO) (La Silla), have been decomposed by fitting multiple Point Spread Functions (PSFs). We detect the optical counterparts {{of the four}} known radio point-like components. No additional optical image is found, but due to the compactness of the configuration, our detection limit for additional point sources is rather low (19. 3 in R). The <b>deduced</b> <b>positions</b> and photometry of the four optical components agree pretty well with the radio and IR observations and this study provides further evidence supporting the gravitational lens origin of B 1422 + 231.

The main sources of error involved in positioning model are analyzed and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Two {{prototype}} {{systems of}} The Automated Astronomic Positioning System (AAPS) have been delivered to Defense Mapping Agency (DMA). The AAPS {{was developed to}} automate and expedite the determination of astronomic positions (latitude and longitude). This equipment is capable of defining astronomic positions to an accuracy sigma = 0. 3 in each component within a two hour span of stellar observations which are acquired automatically. The basic concept acquires observations by timing stellar images as they cross a series of slits, comparing these observations to a stored star catalogue, and automatically <b>deducing</b> <b>position</b> and accuracy by least squares using pre-set convergence criteria. An exhaustive DMA operational test program has been initiated to evaluate {{the capabilities of the}} AAPS in a variety of environments (both climatic and positional).

50|$|The Transit {{system was}} made {{obsolete}} by the Global Positioning System (GPS), and ceased navigation service in 1996.

The Zahirites are joined in this by early scholars such as Tawus ibn Kaysan and Qatadah.

We compare the performance of our method against magnetic tracking on phantom and liver data, and show that our method is able to provide results in agreement with magnetic tracking...|$|R

In {{this article}} we outline the {{structure}} of a general relativistic astrometric model which has been developed to <b>deduce</b> the <b>position</b> and proper motion of stars from 1 -microarcsecond optical observations made by an astrometric satellite orbiting around the Sun. The basic assumption of our model is that the Solar System is the only source of gravity, hence we show how we modeled the satellite observations in a many-body perturbative approach limiting ourselves to the order of accuracy of (v/c) 2. The microarcsecond observing scenario outlined is that for the GAIA astrometric mission...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that gamma-ray burst light curves may consist of many superposed flares with a duration shorter than 30 /microsec. If true, the implications for the interpretation of burst data are enormous. With the launch of the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory, four predictions of Mitrofanov's (1989) suggestion can be tested. Our results which contradict this suggestion are (1) the photon arrival times are not correlated between independent detectors, (2) the spectral hardness and intensity does not depend on the detector area, (3) the bursts seen by detectors which measure photon positions do not see microsecond flares, and (4) burst <b>positions</b> <b>deduced</b> from detectors with different projected areas are close to the <b>positions</b> <b>deduced</b> from time-of-flight differences between separated spacecraft. We conclude, therefore, that gamma-ray bursts are not composed of microsecond flares...|$|R
