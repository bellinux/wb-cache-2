In parallel, the Swedish group developed the whole pancreas transplantation technique with enteric diversion. It was the onset of the whole pancreas reign. The enthusiasm for the technique was rather moderated in its early phase due to the rapid development of liver transplantation and the need for sharing vascular structures between both organs, liver and pancreas.

40|$|Cystic {{echinococcosis}} (CE) and {{alveolar echinococcosis}} (AE) are chronic, complex and neglected diseases. Their treatment {{depends on a}} number of factors related to the lesion, setting and patient. We performed a literature review of curative or palliative non-surgical, non-chemical interventions in CE and AE. In CE, some of these techniques, like radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFA), were shelved after initial attempts, while others, such as High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound, appear promising but are still in a pre-clinical phase. In AE, RFA has never been tested, however, radiotherapy or heavy-ion therapies have been attempted in experimental models. Still, application to humans is questionable. In CE, although prospective clinical studies are still lacking, therapeutic, non-surgical <b>drainage</b> <b>techniques,</b> such as PAIR (puncture, aspiration, injection, re-aspiration) and its derivatives, are now considered a useful option in selected cases.

40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} results of the excision, {{plication}} and internal drainage techniques for hydrocele repair. Patients and methods Between January 1990 and June 1998, 132 patients (mean age 54. 36 years, range 16 - 83) underwent repair for idiopathic hydrocele using one of three techniques (excision, eversion/plication or internal drainage); the complication and recurrence rates of each technique were evaluated. Results The excisional technique resulted in the highest complication rate (81 %) and the internal <b>drainage</b> <b>technique</b> the lowest (7 %). Postoperative scrotal oedema occurred in 74 % of patients after plication and this was the highest rate among the techniques (P < 0. 001). Differences in the rates of wound infection and haematoma among the three techniques were not statistically significant. The internal <b>drainage</b> <b>technique</b> had the highest recurrence rate (85 %) and the excisional technique the lowest (1. 3 %; P < 0. 001). Conclusions Although useful, the internal <b>drainage</b> <b>technique</b> has a high recurrence rate and we suggest abandoning its use for hydrocele repair. The present results suggest that plication is better than excision, causing fewer complications, and better than internal drainage, as the results are more favourable...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Pancreatic-fluid {{collections}} are frequent sequelae of acute and chronic pancreatitis, and endoscopic drainage of these collections has gained acceptance {{as an alternative}} to surgical drainage. METHODS: Patient data, collection characteristics, <b>drainage</b> <b>technique,</b> and outcomes were obtained through chart review and prospective follow-up for 116 patients with attempted endoscopic drainage of symptomatic pancreatic-fluid collections. RESULTS: A total of 116 patients presented with fluid collections classified as acute fluid collection (n = 5), necrosis (n = 8), acute pseudocyst (n = 30), chronic pseudocyst (n = 64), and pancreatic abscess (n = 9). The median diameter of the collection drained was 60 mm (15 - 275 mm). Median follow-up after drainage was 21 months. The <b>drainage</b> <b>technique</b> was transpapillary in 15 patients, transmural in 60, and both in 41. Successful resolution of symptoms and collection occurred in 87. 9 % of cases. No difference in success rates was observed between patients with acute pancreatitis and those with chronic pancreatitis. However, drainage of organized necrosis was associated with a significantly higher failure rate than other collections. No significant differences were observed regarding success when disease, <b>drainage</b> <b>technique,</b> or site of drainage was considered. Complications occurred in 13 patients (11 %), and there were 6 deaths in the 30 days after drainage, including one that was procedure related. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic drainage of pancreatic-fluid collections is successful in the majority of patients and is accompanied by an acceptable complication rate.

40|$|Disallowed gas {{concentration}} (DGC), i. e., a cease in production due to {{gas concentration}} exceeding the allowable limits, occurs frequently {{during the initial}} mining phase of longwall faces in Yangquan Coalfield, and seriously affects safety. The mechanism of DGC during the initial mining phase of longwall face is determined by analyzing the outflow behavior of methane. The results show that mining can induce ground movement and lead to pressure relief, leading to desorption and migration of the gas in the adjacent seams. Gas drainage from the high-level gas drainage roadway is unsuccessful because it is normally located too high to connect to vertical broken crevices of overlying strata {{in a timely manner}} during the initial mining phase, subsequently, the released methane from adjacent seams flows into the goaf. This results in the occurrence of DGC at the longwall face. Thus, based on the analysis of overlying strata movement and the flow characteristics of gas from adjacent seams, we propose an adjacent seams gas <b>drainage</b> <b>technique</b> of a large-diameter blind shaft joined to the high-level gas drainage roadway (LDBS-HGDR) for the initial mining phase. A computational fluid dynamics simulation was conducted to obtain the optimal design of the layout parameters for the LDBS-HGDR at Panel 15201.
