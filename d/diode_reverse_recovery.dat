40|$|The {{presented}} paper {{investigates the}} relationship between high frequency oscillations created in power modules and their radio frequency noise emission. It is shown that high frequency oscillations with slew rates comparable or higher than the ones generated by the used semiconductors leads to significant higher noise emission in the radio frequency range. During turn on of the IGBT a high frequency oscillation is created between the stray inductances of the DC-Link and the reverse capacitances of the blocking freewheeling diodes. The DC-Link stray inductances are charged by the <b>reverse</b> <b>recovery</b> current of the freewheeling <b>diode.</b> When the <b>reverse</b> <b>recovery</b> current peak is passed the diode begins to block and the energy stored in the inductances oscillates to the reverse capacitance of the diode.
