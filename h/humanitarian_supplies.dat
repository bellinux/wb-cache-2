5|$|A {{detachment}} of Hercules from Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons supported INTERFET operations in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000. When violence broke out following the East Timor Special Autonomy Referendum on 30August 1999, C-130H sorties were flown into the then-Indonesian province from 6 to 14September to evacuate United Nations personnel {{as well as}} other foreign citizens and East Timorese refugees. Four C-130E sorties were also conducted to drop food and other <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supplies</b> to refugees on 17 and 18September. On 19September a C-130 dropped a Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) team near the East Timorese capital of Dili ahead of the arrival of the main INTERFET force the next day. From 20September, thirteen RAAF Hercules (designated No.86 Wing DetachmentB) and transport aircraft from several other countries flew troops and supplies into East Timor. These aircraft also dropped <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supplies</b> to refugees who had fled to mountainous regions. The poor condition of most East Timorese airfields and the potential threat of being fired upon by pro-Indonesian militia were constant dangers throughout this operation.|$|E
5|$|The {{disposal}} of the C-130As took almost a decade, {{with the process}} being subject to a police investigation. Attempts to sell the Hercules by tender during 1978 and 1979 were unsuccessful, and the American law firm Ford and Vlahos was appointed the sales agent for the aircraft in 1981. One was sold to the French Government in 1983 and subsequently transferred to the Chadian Air Force. Another two Hercules were sold to the Colombian charter company Aviaco in 1983, but the US State Department vetoed the deal shortly before {{it was to have}} been completed over suspicions that the aircraft would be used to smuggle drugs into the United States. A C-130A was transferred to the newly established company International Air Aid and leased to the International Red Cross to fly <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supplies</b> into Ethiopia during 1986, but this contract was cancelled after the C-130's pilot was accused by the Ethiopian government of photographing a military area. The Australian Federal Police eventually charged two people with defrauding the Commonwealth and conspiracy in relation to these attempts to dispose of the C-130As. Eventually, four of the C-130As were sold to Aboitiz Air Transport Corporation in May 1988 and another four were acquired by the Fowler Aeronautical Corporation the next year. Two of the remaining three aircraft were retained by the RAAF for training and heritage purposes, and the final C-130A was scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Three Australian C-17s were {{deployed}} to Japan {{as part of}} Operation Pacific Assist following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on 11 March. The first aircraft departed Australia {{two days after the}} disaster carrying 75 emergency response personnel, most of whom were members of Fire and Rescue NSW. After delivering the personnel to Yokota Air Base, the C-17 remained in Japan to provide additional airlift to the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF). In this role, the C-17 moved elements of the Japanese 15th Brigade from Okinawa to Honshu, and also transported supplies from a JSDF base in Hokkaido. On 21/22 March, two other C-17s (including one temporarily brought back from the Middle East) flew a large water cannon system from RAAF Base Pearce in Western Australia to Yokota; owned by the Bechtel corporation, the water cannon formed part of the efforts to bring the badly damaged Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant under control. With the arrival of these aircraft, all three of the available Australian C-17s were in Japan (the fourth was still undergoing maintenance at Amberley). The RAAF maintained a C-17, two flight crews and support personnel in Japan until 25 March. By the end of this deployment the Australian aircraft had conducted 31 sorties and delivered 450 tonnes of cargo. No. 36 Squadron maintained a C-17 in the Middle East over most of this period. Also in March 2011, Smith stated that the Australian Government would probably provide C-17s to transport <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supplies</b> to Libya if the United Nations requested assistance.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the value of fourth-party logistics (4 PL) services in a <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain. Furthermore, it shows a framework for a fourth-party humanitarian logistics concept. Design/methodology/approach – The research paper presents a framework of fourth-party humanitarian logistics based on the four core components described by Christopher (2005) which was evaluated with a nonlinear approach called analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The AHP method explores qualitative and quantitative decision-making criteria in case of solving multi-attribute and complex problems. In total, seven experts from academia and practice have contributed to this research, resulting in a better understanding of the decisive needs of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain actors for implementing and integrating a 4 PL concept. Findings – The research shows an increased value for <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain actors of establishing a 4 PL concept. The results present a positive influence of 4 PL in complex disasters environments and provide key drivers for increasing and simplifying collaboration between the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain actors. Research limitations/implications – Future research has to consider different disaster types and needs to further emphasize the added value for beneficiaries of implementing a 4 PL concept in a <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain environment. Further research should preferably also consider case studies in order to analyse challenges, drawbacks and benefits of this concept (qualitative and quantitative factors) in a real-life <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain setting. Practical implications – The research offers managerial insights into the use of a 4 PL concept in the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain environment to improve efficiency due to an improved collaboration between the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain actors. Originality/value – The research paper investigates an under-researched topic in the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain environment. For <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain actors outsourcing their activities to a 4 PL service provider could secure collaboration, increase service levels as well as efficiency and therefore create additional value...|$|R
40|$|Design/methodology/approach - A {{literature}} review {{has been conducted}} using a structured method based on Denyer and Tranfield (2009) and Rousseau et al. (2008). The {{state of the art}} on <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain performance management with a focus on measurement frameworks and indicators and their applications in practice is classified in three categories. The first category is the definition and measurement of success in <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chains. The second category is managing performance, which focuses on describing and analyzing the actual practice of managing performance. The third category shows the challenges in performance management that <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain actors deal with. Findings - Findings reveal that performance measurement and management in <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chains is still an open area of research, especially compared to the commercial supply chain sector. Furthermore, the research indicates that performance measurement and management in <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chains has to be developed in support of the supply chain strategy. Based on the findings of the {{literature review}} on performance measurement and management in the commercial and humanitarian field, a first classification of 94 performance measurement indicators in <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chains is presented.

40|$|AbstractProcurement for <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chains {{is often}} done by {{agencies}} that underlie public procurement regulations. These regulations {{tend to focus}} on transparency and openness, in other words, tender processes, price and quality. In other words, public procurement can be seen as hindering innovation through its rigidity. At the same time, humanitarian organizations face highly turbulent environments, sudden demand, and disaster- and context-specific requirements on items and technologies. Innovation in <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chains needs to be swift but also robust, fitting an environment with disruptions in critical infrastructures such as energy and transportation. In spite of context-specific requirements, innovation does not stand alone but impacts on the supply chain through its requirements on suppliers, use in other echelons, and even, use across various sectors. Innovation thus cascades both upstream the supply chain and across sectors. Such cascades need to be identified, managed, or if detrimental, mitigated in the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain. This paper therefore develops a framework for cascading innovation in <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chains...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBusiness {{collaboration}} is increasingly {{the focus of}} management scholars and practitioners alike. Collaboration brings both benefits to organizations and numerous challenges. In disaster management, the response to events that impact people, communities and businesses frequently involves the response of multiple organizations.

40|$|The {{field of}} <b>humanitarian</b> {{logistics}} and <b>supply</b> chain management is increasingly {{the subject of}} research. Even though {{there has been some}} research in the field in the past, the necessity for more research related to the measurement of the effectiveness of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chains is required. <b>Humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain management deals not only with natural disasters but also with man-made disasters. Thus, different types of disasters create different challenges for humanitarian aid. Moreover, the different stages of the disasters require different courses of action. The lack of extended research in the field of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain and logistics, the increase of the impact of disasters as well as the differences between the commercial and the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chains, make it clear that the sector should find ways to improve its efficiency. Tools and metrics can be used to measure and improve the efficiency of the supply chains. According to literature there are no sophisticated measures of effectiveness for humanitarian logi stics and supply chains.

The main findings from analysing the empirical data revealed that, depending on the disaster phase, humanitarian organisations face different challenges in their supply chains. By implementing appropriate performance measurements, the humanitarian organisations can limit the impact of the challenges in the supply chain operations, gain more relevant and precise information regarding the humanitarian operations, and enhance supply chain coordination among different stakeholders. As an outcome, by implementing appropriate performance measurement systems, the humanitarian organisations can overcome some of these challenges in their supply chains, and therefore enhance the overall supply chain performance...|$|R

40|$|In {{humanitarian}} aid organisations, due to increasing pressure from donors, {{there is an}} urge to professionalise and optimise the way supply chains are managed. In the commercial companies there is strong evidence that focusing more on supply chain management can improve efficiency and lead to major cost savings which makes it very interesting for {{humanitarian aid}} organisations to adopt practices from the commercial world. The concepts of agility and leanness are said to prepare organisations to respond quickly to fluctuating customer demand (agility) and to increase efficiency through waste elimination and process optimisation (leanness), two properties which are required by humanitarian and commercial organisations likewise. In the commercial context agility and leanness are often combined as a le-agile strategy which is also applicable for <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chains where the distinct <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain stages – preparedness, response, and reconstruction – follow different objectives and operate in different environments. Based on existing literature, this thesis identifies and examines the combination of lean and agile strategies with the different <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain stages. The combination possibility for a le-agile strategy {{is based on the}} base-surge demand approach from commercial literature. Moreover, agile and lean supply chain characteristics as well as practices how to achieve these characteristics are identified and illustrated in a theoretical framework. The empirical, qualitative research using a single-case study strategy further explores the supply chain practices of the Georgia Red Cross Society (GRCS) during the armed conflict in 2008. These lean and agile practices were studied by looking at preparedness, response and recovery stages related to the event, as well as the new preparedness phase, emerged after the armed conflict. The key findings indicate that lean practices are performed by the case organisation in the preparedness stage and to some lower extent in the reconstruction stage. Agile practices were evidenced in the response stage of the armed conflict. Overall, the findings support the theoretical propositions made prior to the empirical research. However, {{in the case of the}} studied organisation, the findings indicate that not all lean practices, identified from the commercial supply chain literature, were applied in the preparedness and reconstruction stages likewise. Nevertheless, in general there was a tendency for using lean practices in both stages of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain. Another finding indicates that lean and agile practices are strongly linked and support each other. This was clearly reflected in an interconnection between preparedness and response stages, whereas implementation of efficient lean practices during the preparedness stage supported a quick and agile reaction to the armed conflict in the response stage. Additionally, it was found out that the reconstruction and preparedness stages of the GRCS <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain are connected through an iterative process of continuous learning and improvements. This thesis contributes to existing literature by providing empirical proof for the existence of lean and agile strategies in the preparedness, response, and reconstruction stages of the case organisation’s <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain. These results also support the possibility to use the commercial base and surge demand model for combining lean and agile strategies with the different <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain stages, which represents an under-investigated field in existing <b>humanitarian</b> <b>supply</b> chain literature...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to provide}} a {{commentary}} and an overview of developments {{in the field of}} humanitarianism that could impact theoretical understanding of agility in <b>humanitarian</b> aid <b>supply</b> chains over the past decade. Design/methodology/approach: Authors review papers published on agility in <b>humanitarian</b> aid <b>supply</b> chains from 2006 to 2015 in the four leading Emerald-published logistics and supply chain management journals. These are: Supply Chain Management : An International Journal (SCMIJ); International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management (IJPDLM); International Journal of Operations and Production Management (IJOPM); and Journal of <b>Humanitarian</b> Logistics and <b>Supply</b> Chain Management (JHLSCM). This paper presents an overview and update of developments that have the potential to influence current thinking and understanding about agility in <b>humanitarian</b> aid <b>supply</b> chains, and <b>humanitarian</b> aid <b>supply</b> chains in general. Findings: Humanitarianism and the environment of Humanitarian organisations are evolving. Such evolution has potential impacts on theoretical discussions and understanding of agility in <b>humanitarian</b> aid <b>supply</b> chains and <b>humanitarian</b> aid <b>supply</b> chains in general. Research limitations/implications: This is not a critical literature review but an overview. The paper is based on four logistics and supply chain management journals only.
