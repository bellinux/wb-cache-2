5|$|The missionaries {{introduced}} a musical form of chant into Britain, {{similar to that}} used in Rome during the mass. During the 7th and 8th centuries Canterbury was renowned for the excellence of its clergy's chanting, and sent singing masters to instruct others, including two to Wilfrid, who became Bishop of York. Putta, the first Bishop of Rochester, had a reputation for his skill at chanting, which he was said to <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> the Gregorian missionaries. One of them, James the Deacon, taught chanting in Northumbria after Paulinus returned to Kent; Bede noted that James was accomplished in the singing of the chants.|$|E
25|$|Trump {{supports}} Kiyosaki's view on {{the learning}} opportunity created by failure, writing, students who {{rise to the top}} of the class academically are not always those who succeed at entrepreneurship. He writes this is due to a fear of failure, and ascribes business success to the experience of learning from failures. Trump compares this to the business sector, writing that those who <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> failures in business simultaneously learn how to become successful entrepreneurs. He differentiates between practical intelligence and academic intelligence.|$|E

The Military Commissions Act of 2006 will allow the continuation of a CIA program that {{has been one of}} America's most potent tools in fighting the War on Terror. Under this program, suspected terrorists have been detained and questioned about threats against our country.

25|$|For {{the next}} fifteen years, from 982 to 997, High King Máel Sechnaill {{repeatedly}} led armies into Leinster and Munster, while Brian, {{like his father}} and brother before him, led his naval forces up the Shannon to attack Connacht and Meath {{on either side of}} the river. He suffered quite a few reverses in this struggle, but appears to <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> his setbacks. He developed a military strategy that would serve him well throughout his career: the coordinated use of forces on both land and water, including on rivers and along Ireland's coast. Brian's naval forces, which included contingents supplied by the Hiberno-Norse cities that he brought under his control, provided both indirect and direct support for his forces on land. Indirect support involved a fleet making a diversionary attack on an enemy in a location far away from where Brian planned to strike with his army. Direct support involved naval forces acting as one arm in a strategic pincer, the army forming the other arm.|$|E

500|$|Completing 25-of-38 {{passes for}} 247 yards with a {{touchdown}} and one interception, Manning led the Colts to a 29–17 {{victory over the}} Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI and was voted Super Bowl MVP. Manning, who had been criticized for failing to win big games, exorcised his big-game demons with the win. [...] "In years' past when our team's come up short, it's been disappointing", he told reporters. [...] "Somehow we {{found a way to}} <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> some of those losses and we've been a better team because of it." [...] For his role in the Colts' championship run, Manning was awarded the ESPY for Best Championship Performance. Manning was again named to the Pro Bowl and was also named Second-team All-Pro; in the Pro Bowl he played only two series, passing for 67 yards. Following the Super Bowl win, Manning agreed to restructure his contract to save the Colts $8.2million in salary cap space.|$|E

In The Fall of Reach, a lone Covenant ship bombards the Harvest colony with plasma, turning the planet's crust into molten glass. The lone ship, broadcasts the Covenant edict, [...] "Your destruction is {{the will of the}} gods, and we are their instrument", and destroys several United Nations Space Command (UNSC) ships sent to attack it. Contact Harvest describes a lengthy ground engagement between human militia and Covenant before the total assault on Harvest. The Covenant claim that humans are an offense to their gods, but in reality, three Covenant Prophets <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> a relic left by their gods, the Forerunners, that humans, who may possibly be genetically related to the Forerunners, have been chosen by the Forerunners as their Reclaimers. Realizing such a revelation would splinter the Covenant, the newly crowned Hierarchs decide to obliterate the humans instead and declare that a new Age of the Covenant has begun.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Matt Risley {{rated the}} episode 8 out of 10, saying it {{delivered}} [...] "a solid and traditional Whovian tale, albeit one at its best", {{though it was}} [...] "nothing groundbreaking" [...] yet. He went on to praise the supporting cast that [...] "managed to sell both their flawed human originals and their progressively bonkers ganger counterparts" [...] {{as well as the}} setting. However, he questioned Rory's willingness to protect Jennifer, as he thought Rory would <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> his experiences with death to be more careful. Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy gave the episode four out of five stars, saying that [...] "The Rebel Flesh" [...] "strikes a satisfying balance between the humorous and the horrific" [...] from the cold open. He commended Graham for handling the two-part structure by using extra time to explore the characters and themes, and thought the highlight of the episode were Rory's scenes with Jennifer. However, he criticised the CGI used in some scenes, although he called the prosthetics used for the Gangers [...] "impressive", as well as the episode for ending in [...] "a damp squib of a cliffhanger" [...] that was [...] "clearly too telegraphed throughout the episode".|$|E

500|$|In North America, the Series (particularly {{the first}} few games) exposed the need for better {{preparation}} and off-season training. Philadelphia Flyers coach Fred Shero became an avid student of the Soviet style {{and was one of}} the first to bring the Soviet training techniques to the NHL as the Flyers won two Stanley Cup championships in 1974 and 1975. Tom Mellor (who joined the small but rapidly growing group of American-born NHL players after the 1972 Olympics) lamented that the NHL training methods of the early 1970s were vastly inferior to those of the Soviets. [...] "When I went to play for Detroit after the Olympics, Alex Delvecchio was the coach.... When he would coach, we would do a couple of one-on-ones, two-on-twos, three-on-twos, we'd scrimmage, and he would scrimmage with us. At the end of the scrimmage, we'd do a couple of figure eights and then go to the bar. That was the NHL and pro mentality." [...] Mark Howe commented that the Soviet national team must have trained six hours on the day of a game in the 1972 Winter Olympics. On the other hand, Swedish sports journalists were extremely impressed by the toughness and [...] "never say die" [...] fighting spirit of the Canadians, who lost only one game out of seven on European ice despite usually trailing in the third period. According to Soviet player Boris Mikhailov, who later became a coach, [...] "it was a meeting between two schools of hockey and we have since continued this great exchange and we <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> each other, taking the best of both styles." ...|$|E
