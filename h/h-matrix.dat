40|$|<b>H-matrix</b> {{techniques}} use a data-sparse {{tree structure}} {{to represent a}} dense or a sparse matrix. The leaves of the tree store matrix sub-blocks that are represented in full-matrix format or Rk-matrix (low rank matrix) format. <b>H-matrix</b> arithmetic is defined over the <b>H-matrix</b> representation, which includes operations such as addition, multiplication, inversion, and LU factorization. These <b>H-matrix</b> operations approximate results with almost optimal computational complexity. Based on the properties of H-matrices, the <b>H-matrix</b> preconditioner technique has been introduced. It uses <b>H-matrix</b> operations to construct preconditioners, which are used in iterative methods {{to speed up the}} solution of large systems of linear equations (Ax = b). To apply the <b>H-matrix</b> preconditioner technique, {{the first step is to}} represent a problem in <b>H-matrix</b> format. The approaches to construct an <b>H-matrix</b> can be divided into two categories: geometric approaches and algebraic approaches. In this thesis, we present our contributions to algebraic <b>H-matrix</b> construction approaches and <b>H-matrix</b> preconditioner technique. We have developed a new algebraic <b>H-matrix</b> construction approach based on matrix graphs and multilevel graph clustering approaches. Based on the new construction approach, we have also developed a scheme to build algebraic <b>H-matrix</b> preconditioners for systems of saddle point type. To verify the effectiveness of our new construction approach and <b>H-matrix</b> preconditioner scheme, we have applied them to solve various systems of linear equations arising from finite element methods and meshfree methods. The experimental results show that our preconditioners are competitive to other <b>H-matrix</b> preconditioners based on domain decomposition and existing preconditioners such as JOR and AMG preconditioners. Our <b>H-matrix</b> construction approach and preconditioner technique provide an alternative effective way to solve large systems of linear equations...|$|E

Several types of <b>H-matrices</b> have been analysed in Hackbusch (Computing 62 (1999) 89 – 108) and Hackbusch and Khoromskij (Preprint MPI, No. 22, Leipzig, 1999; Computing 64 (2000) 21 – 47) which are able to approximate integral (nonlocal) operators in FEM and BEM applications {{in the case of}} quasi-uniform unstructured meshes. In the present paper, the general construction of <b>H-matrices</b> on rectangular and triangular meshes is proposed and analysed. First, the reliability of <b>H-matrices</b> in BEM is discussed. Then, we prove the optimal complexity of storage and matrix–vector multiplication in the case of rather arbitrary admissibility parameters η< 1 and for finite elements up to the order 1 defined on quasi-uniform rectangular/triangular meshes in Rd,d= 1, 2, 3.

In this study, we constructed a friction model of quasi-dynamic earthquake cycles on a flat, dipping, plate interface in a semi-infinite homogeneous elastic medium, and investigated the effectiveness of <b>H-matrices</b> by changing N from 104 to 106. Construction of <b>H-matrices</b> involves several parameters controlling the structure and accuracy of the approximated matrix. With <b>H-matrices</b> using proper values for these parameters to maintain accuracy, except for smaller values of the parameter for suppressing the ranks of the outermost submatrices, the memory size of the matrix was reduced to about O(N). The computational time in the multiplication was also reduced to O(N) for a range of N values less than about 105, and to O(N) ∼ O(NlogN) for a larger range. Thus, we found that the application of <b>H-matrices</b> greatly reduces the computational time and memory size in earthquake cycle simulations.
