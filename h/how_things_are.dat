5|$|Each {{solution}} of Einstein's equation encompasses {{the whole history}} of a universe— it is not just some snapshot of <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are,</b> but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a coordinate condition, which is analogous to gauge fixing in other field theories.|$|E

2500|$|To {{think about}} social {{transformation}} programmatically, one must first mark the direction one wants society to move in, and then identify {{the first steps}} {{with which we can}} move in that direction. In this way we can formulate proposals at points along the trajectory, be they relatively close to <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> now or relatively far away. This provides a third way between revolution and reform. It is revolutionary reform, where one has a revolutionary vision, but acts on that vision in a sequence of piecemeal reforms. As Unger puts it, transformative politics is [...] "not about blueprints; it is about pathways. It is not architecture; it is music".|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} two core members, Abbath and Demonaz, Immortal did not find a stable lineup until 1996, when drummer Horgh joined the band and is {{credited}} on their album, Blizzard Beasts. A major turning point for the band was in 1997 when Demonaz suffered acute tendinitis in his arm {{and was unable to}} continue playing, and Abbath took over for guitar. Despite this, Demonaz continued writing lyrics and has been a manager for the band, accompanying them on tour, releasing updates and giving interviews about <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> progressing with the band. Abbath and Horgh wrote and recorded the band's next album, At the Heart of Winter.

Later on when he imagines things they might come across in their travels he only mentions the gutter and a muckheap.

2500|$|The term sacca (Sanskrit: satya) is {{a central}} term in Indian thought and religion.

[...] They function as [...] "a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought." [...] According to K.R. Norman, probably the best translation is [...] "the truth of the noble one (the Buddha)." [...] It is a statement of <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> seen by a Buddha, how things really are when seen correctly. It is the truthful way of seeing, Through not seeing things this way, and behaving accordingly, we suffer.|$|E
2500|$|Grant {{completed}} {{a degree in}} material sciences at the University of Leeds in 1994.

He returned to Britain in 1995 to take up a career in marketing, first at cable-makers BICC and Corning, before moving to optical components manufacturer Bookham Technology in 2000. From 2004, Grant studied for a MBA degree, funded by Bookham, at Saïd Business School, University of Oxford, where {{he was a member of}} New College.

2500|$|Protagoras is {{credited}} with the philosophy of relativism, which he discusses in his work, Truth (also known as Refutations). Although knowledge of his work is limited, discussion of Protagoras' relativism is based {{on one of his}} most famous statements: [...] "Man is the measure of all things: {{of the things that are}}, that they are, of the things that are not, that they are not." [...] By this, Protagoras meant that each individual is the measure of <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> perceived by that individual. Therefore, things are, or are not, true according to how the individual perceives them. For example, Person X may believe that the weather is cold, whereas Person Y may believe that the weather is hot. According to the philosophy of Protagoras, there is no absolute evaluation of the nature of a temperature because the evaluation will be relative to who is perceiving it. Therefore, to Person X, the weather is cold, whereas to Person Y, the weather is hot. This philosophy implies that there are no absolute [...] "truths". The truth, according to Protagoras, is relative, and differs according to each individual.|$|E
2500|$|This {{personal}} {{loss was}} immediately followed, on 15 May, by {{the resignation of}} Admiral Fisher after continuing disagreements with Churchill and in frustration at the disappointing developments in Gallipoli. Aged 74, Fisher's behaviour had grown increasingly erratic and, in frequent letters to Lloyd George, he gave vent to his frustrations with the First Lord of the Admiralty; [...] "Fisher writes to me every day or two {{to let me know}} <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> going.

[...] Adverse events, press hostility, Tory opposition and personal sorrows assailed Asquith, and his position was further weakened by his Liberal colleagues. Cassar considers that Lloyd George displayed a distinct lack of loyalty, and Koss writes of the contemporary rumours that Churchill had [...] "been up to his old game of intriguing all round" [...] and reports a claim that Churchill [...] "unquestionably inspired" [...] the Repington Letter, in collusion with Sir John French. Lacking cohesion internally, and attacked from without, Asquith determined that his government could not continue and he wrote to the King, [...] "I have come decidedly to the conclusion that the [...] must be reconstituted on a broad and non-party basis." ...|$|E

The merger proposal, which did not proceed far toward approval at the time, would have eliminated the Cabinet-level post to which McMahon is now nominated. The Connecticut Post of Bridgeport, Connecticut examined issues of potential conflicts of interest from remaining WWE stock holdings and other financial assets {{as well as of}} the relationship between WWE and smaller businesses in the wrestling world, with critics and supporters cited. A commentary at the Washington Post looked more generally at how to consider [...] "wrestling as an art form" [...] and credited WWE—despite many deaths of retired athletes at relatively young ages—with a better record on CTE and other athlete health issues than the NFL. The Hill provided a venue for two industry representatives to specify how they hoped McMahon would reform the agency she's been tapped to lead. Huffington Post examined child sexual abuse cases at WWE/WWF in the early 1990s that the nominee took a direct role in addressing. One led to a cash settlement with a disclaimer of guilt.
