25|$|Overall, {{on a first}} date, women’s {{goals are}} related more to {{establishing}} friendships and having fun. Mongeau, in his 2004 study found that 60 percent of women go on first dates mainly to <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> 59 percent go on dates to reduce uncertainty. (Note, however, {{that there are some}} errors in the mathematical calculations done in the study, and the study is statistically invalid as it uses the convenience sampling method.) Women's goals tend to be more relationship-oriented than men’s goals. Also, unlike men, women are usually more reserved {{when it comes to the}} sexual aspect and having sex. Women are more likely to express companionship, friendship, and romantic relationship goals than men and are also more likely to consider the first date in terms of their relational implications than men.|$|E

The show consisted of her friends, Glenn and Ashley — who are often encouraging Brooke to get out, <b>have</b> <b>fun,</b> <b>and</b> party. Brooke, Glenn, and Ashley live in a penthouse in South Beach, which is paid for by VH1. The show chronicled the problems Brooke faced while dealing with the divorce of her parents, as well as brother Nick Hogan's prior arrest related to a serious car accident in which he permanently injured his best friend. Hogan's father has appeared in numerous episodes of the series, while her mother and brother have made a few. The series ended in 2009 after two seasons.|$|E
