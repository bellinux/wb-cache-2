50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that a drum brake's <b>friction</b> <b>contact</b> area is at the {{circumference}} of the brake, a drum brake can provide more braking force than an equal diameter disc brake. The increased <b>friction</b> <b>contact</b> area of drum brake shoes on the drum allows drum brake shoes to last longer than disc brake pads used in a brake system of similar dimensions and braking force. Drum brakes retain heat and are more complex than disc brakes but are often the more economical and powerful brake type to use in rear brake applications due to the low heat generation of rear brakes, a drum brake's self-applying nature, larger friction surface contact area, and long life wear characteristics (%life used/kW of braking power).|$|E

50|$|This main {{principle}} {{is illustrated in}} the figure of the rolling cylinders. If two equal cylinders are pressed together then the contact surface is flat. In the absence of surface <b>friction,</b> <b>contact</b> stresses are normal (i.e. perpendicular) to the contact surface. Consider a particle that enters the contact area at the right side, travels through the contact patch and leaves at the left side. Initially its vertical deformation is increasing, which is resisted by the hysteresis effect. Therefore, an additional pressure is generated to avoid interpenetration of the two surfaces. Later its vertical deformation is decreasing. This is again resisted by the hysteresis effect. In this case this decreases the pressure that is needed to keep the two bodies separate.|$|E

Sleeve bearings are less durable at higher temperatures as the contact surfaces wear and the lubricant dries up, eventually leading to failure; however, lifetime {{is similar to}} that of ball-bearing types (generally a little less) at relatively low ambient temperatures. Sleeve bearings may be more likely to fail at higher temperatures, and may perform poorly when mounted in any orientation other than vertical. The typical lifespan of a sleeve-bearing fan may be around 30,000 hours at 50 °C. Fans that use sleeve bearings are generally cheaper than fans that use ball bearings, and are quieter at lower speeds early in their life, but can become noisy as they age.|$|E

40|$|The {{modelling}} of nonlinear <b>friction</b> <b>contact</b> interfaces in {{structural dynamics}} currently attracts large research interest since the accurate {{characteristics of the}} friction interfaces are required in the nonlinear dynamic analysis of assembled structures.

This investigation focused on three major parameters used in the nonlinear <b>friction</b> <b>contact</b> analysis: (i) the friction coefficient, (ii) the tangential contact stiffness, and (iii) the normal load distribution in the contact. The accuracy of the measured friction input parameters is evaluated and possibilities to obtain reliable normal load distributions for a successful prediction of the measured frequency response function are investigated. Average friction input parameters, based on a large set of experimental data, are introduced, and their effect on the nonlinear resonance response is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the domain of attraction for the steady sliding equilibrium point ischaracterized for a system in which normal force is coupled to tangential displacement. Perturbations consisting of sudden changes in the position and velocity of the loading point are considered. These perturbations can be viewed as either actuator disturbances or changes in control input. The effect and interaction of the frictional and geometric parameters are elucidated. The results are applicable to the design and analysis of systems in which steady motion without friction-induced limit cycles is desired...|$|R
