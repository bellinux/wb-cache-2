40|$|Cell {{migration}} during {{wound healing}} requires adhesion receptor turnover {{to enable the}} formation and disassembly of cell-extracellular matrix contacts. Although recent advances have improved our understanding of integrin trafficking pathways, {{it is not known}} how extracellular ligand <b>engagement</b> <b>controls</b> receptor dynamics. Using atomic force microscopy, we have measured cell avidity for fibronectin and defined a mechanism for the outside-in regulation of α 5 β 1 -integrin. Surprisingly, adhesive strength was attenuated by the syndecan- 4 -binding domain of fibronectin due to a rapid triggering of α 5 β 1 -integrin endocytosis. Association of syndecan- 4 with PKCα was found to trigger RhoG activation and subsequent dynamin- and caveolin-dependent integrin uptake. Like disruption of syndecan- 4 or caveolin, gene disruption of RhoG in mice was found to retard closure of dermal wounds due to a migration defect of the fibroblasts and keratinocytes of RhoG null mice. Thus, this syndecan- 4 -regulated integrin endocytic pathway appears to {{play a key role in}} tissue repair...|$|R

40|$|Lately, {{with the}} {{increasing}} use of automated manual transmissions (AMT) the <b>engagement</b> <b>control</b> of the dry clutch becomes more important. The <b>engagement</b> <b>control</b> plays a crucial role, since different and conflicting objectives have to be satisfied: preservation of driver comfort, fast engagement and small friction losses. In this paper two optimal control strategies for clutch engagement, based on hybrid control principles, are compared. For developing a useful clutch control scheme, the driveline is modelled as a piecewise linear system. The first control strategy is widely known as explicit MPC. However, it seems that it is not suitable (yet) for this type of problem. The second strategy is a piecewise LQ controller, based on piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions. Simulation results obtained with both strategies are presented and discussed. ...|$|E

In addition, it investigated whether engagement in health-related self-protection (e. g., positive reappraisals), {{but not in}} health <b>engagement</b> <b>control</b> strategies (e. g., investment of time and effort), would buffer the adverse effect of chronic illness on older adults’ feelings of loneliness. Loneliness was examined repeatedly in two-year intervals over eight years in a longitudinal study of 121 community-dwelling older adults (ageT 1 = 64 to 83 years). In addition, levels of chronic illness, health-related control strategies, and sociodemographic variables were assessed at baseline. Growth-curve models showed that loneliness linearly increased over time, and that this effect was observed only among participants who reported high, but not low, baseline levels of chronic illness.

40|$|To {{test the}} social learning–based {{hypothesis}} that marital conflict resolution patterns are {{learned in the}} family of origin, longitudinal, observational data {{were used to assess}} prospec-tive associations between family conflict interaction patterns during adolescence and off-spring’s later marital conflict interaction patterns. At age 14 years, 47 participants completed an observed family conflict resolution task with their parents. In a subsequent assessment 17 years later, the participants completed measures of marital adjustment and an observed marital conflict interaction task with their spouse. As predicted, levels of hostility and positive engagement expressed by parents and adolescents during family interactions were prospec-tively linked with levels of hostility and positive engagement expressed by offspring and their spouses during marital interactions. Family-of-origin hostility was a particularly robust predictor of marital interaction behaviors; it predicted later marital hostility and negatively predicted positive <b>engagement,</b> <b>controlling</b> for psychopathology and family-of-origin positive engagement.

40|$|Down-regulation of the {{forkhead}} {{transcription factor}} Foxp 1 by integrin <b>engagement</b> <b>controls</b> monocyte differentiation in vitro. To determine whether Foxp 1 plays {{a critical role}} in monocyte differentiation and macrophage functions in vivo, we generated transgenic mice (macFoxp 1 tg) overexpressing human FOXP 1 in monocyte/macrophage lineage cells using the CD 68 promoter. Circulating blood monocytes from macFoxp 1 tg mice have reduced expression of the receptor for macrophage colony-stimulating factor (c-Fms/M-CSFR), impaired migratory capacity, and diminished accumulation as splenic macrophages. Macrophage functions, including cytokine production, phagocytosis, and respiratory burst were globally impaired in macFoxp 1 tg compared with wild-type cells. Osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption activity were also attenuated in macFoxp 1 tg mice. In models of chemical and bacterial peritonitis, macFoxp 1 tg mice exhibited reduced macrophage accumulation, bacterial clearance, and survival. Enforced overexpression of c-Fms/M-CSFR reversed the cytokine production and phagocytosis defects in macFoxp 1 tg macrophages, indicating that repression of c-fms/M-CSFR is likely the dominant mechanism responsible for Foxp 1 action in monocyte differentiation and macrophage function. Taken together, these observations identify down-regulation of Foxp 1 as critical for monocyte differentiation and macrophage functions in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Lymphoproliferative {{diseases}} {{are characterized by}} massive accumulation of CD 4 � CD 8 � B 220 � (double-negative [DN]) T cells in peripheral organs. Although evidence indicates these cells are derived from mature autoreactive �/ � T cells, the significance of coreceptor downregulation is not known. In this study, we examined the role CD 4 coreceptor plays in the survival of repeatedly stimulated T cells. CD 4 �/ � and CD 4 �/ � T cells from AND T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice exhibited similar phenotypes after antigenic stimulation, but the CD 4 �/ � T cells survived in much larger numbers than the CD 4 �/ � cells upon primary and secondary major histocompatibility complex (MHC) /peptide stimulation. Enhanced survival of CD 4 �/ � T cells was due to decreased apoptosis rather than enhanced proliferation. Similarly, circumvention of the CD 4 /MHC interaction by using a surrogate TCR ligand that does not engage CD 4 led to significant enhancement of CD 4 �/ � cells than when stimulated with MHC/peptide. Finally, we generated DN B 220 � T cells using an in vitro model system and showed they were more tolerant to chronic stimulation than CD 4 �/ � cells.

In order to reduce heat generation and frictional dissipation during slipping phase, a novel concept of clutched train is proposed to substitute for friction clutch. The dynamics of clutched train is modeling and integrated into powertrain to estimate the effects of clutched train on longitudinal vehicle oscillations stimulated by the sudden change of accelerator pedal. Further, the <b>engagement</b> <b>control</b> of clutched train can be transplanted from the developed control algorithm of friction clutch due to their similar control-oriented models, and the influence on longitudinal vehicle oscillations aroused by clutched train engagement is investigated.

40|$|The antigen {{recognition}} interface {{formed by}} T helper precursors (Thps) and antigen-presenting cells (APCs), called the immunological synapse (IS), includes receptors and signaling molecules necessary for Thp activation and differentiation. We have recently shown that recruitment of the interferon-{gamma} receptor (IFNGR) into the IS correlates {{with the capacity}} of Thps to differentiate into Th 1 effector cells, an event regulated by signaling through the functionally opposing receptor to interleukin- 4 (IL 4 R). Here, we show that, similar to IFN-{gamma} ligation, TCR stimuli induce the translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT 1) to IFNGR 1 -rich regions of the membrane. Unexpectedly, STAT 1 is preferentially expressed, is constitutively serine (727) phosphorylated in Thp, and is recruited to the IS and the nucleus upon TCR signaling. IL 4 R <b>engagement</b> <b>controls</b> this process by interfering with both STAT 1 recruitment and nuclear translocation. We also show that in cells with deficient Th 1 or constitutive Th 2 differentiation, the IL 4 R is recruited to the IS.

40|$|Regarding {{effects of}} autonomy-support and {{structure}} on engagement and learning, inconsistent results emerged from Self-Determination theory studies. Some authors stress {{the crucial role}} of autonomy-support while others highlight the role of structure. This could due to discrepancy in methodology used and limited use of multilevel analyses. Cognitive load theory also stresses {{the central role of}} structure for learning (Kirschner et al., 2006). This issue seems to be still controversial. If these frameworks seem opposite, some authors support structure and autonomy as orthogonal dimensions (Jang et al., 2010). However, the effects of their interaction have never been tested.
