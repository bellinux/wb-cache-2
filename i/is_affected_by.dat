5|$|Cells of {{the genus}} Azotobacter are {{relatively}} large for bacteria (1–2 μm in diameter). They are usually oval, but may take various forms from rods to spheres. In microscopic preparations, the cells can be dispersed or form irregular clusters or occasionally chains of varying lengths. In fresh cultures, cells are mobile due to the numerous flagella. Later, the cells lose their mobility, become almost spherical, and produce {{a thick layer of}} mucus, forming the cell capsule.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to understand the impact of  monetary variables namely inflation, interest rate, exchange rate and money supply on stock prices in five ASEAN countries namely Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philipinnes and Singapore. These countries has different characteristic than stock market in other countries because their stock market has experienced two big crises. Monetary policy of their government has serious impact on how these countries managed their financial markets.   It was found that there <b>were</b> different variables <b>affecting</b> stock price in these countries. In Indonesia, stock prices <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> stock prices in the past. In Malaysia, stock prices <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> exchange rate.

40|$|Despite {{considerable}} research, {{the effects}} of common types of noise on verbal and spatial information processing are still relatively unknown. Three experiments, using convenience sampling were conducted to investigate the effect of auditory interference on the cognitive performance of 24 adult men and women during the Stroop test, perception of object recognition and spatial location tasks, {{and the perception of}} object size, shape, and spatial location tasks. The data were analyzed using univariate analysis of variance and 1 -way multivariate analysis of variance. The Experiment 1 findings indicated reaction time performance for gender and age group <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> auditory interference between experimental conditions, and recognition accuracy <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> only <b>by</b> experimental condition. The Experiment 2 a results showed reaction time performance for recognizing object features <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> auditory interference between age groups, and recognition accuracy by experimental condition. The Experiment 2 b results demonstrated reaction time performance for detecting the spatial location of objects <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> auditory interference between age groups. In addition, reaction time <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> the type of interference and spatial location. Further, recognition accuracy <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> interference condition and spatial location. The Experiment 3 findings suggested reaction time performance for assessing part-whole relationships <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> auditory interference between age groups. Further, recognition accuracy <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> interference condition between experimental groups. This study may create social change <b>by</b> <b>affecting</b> the design of learning and workplace environments, the neurological correlates of auditory and visual stimuli, and the pathologies of adults such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder...|$|R
5|$|Despite many {{media and}} {{government}} {{claims to the}} contrary, Caroline Island {{was not the first}} point of land to see sunrise on January 1, 2000 (local time); that distinction belongs to a point of land between Dibble Glacier and Victor Bay on the coast of East Antarctica, at , where the sun rose 35 minutes earlier. As this point is close to the Antarctic Circle, and the area beyond the Antarctic Circle <b>is</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> the continuous sunlight in December, the definition of the exact point becomes a question of distinguishing between a sunset and an immediate sunrise in view of atmospheric refraction effects.|$|E
5|$|Despite their rarity, hurricanes {{are among}} Arizona's most {{significant}} weather makers. In years when Arizona <b>is</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> a tropical cyclone, {{these can be}} responsible for up to 25% of the rainfall in areas along the Colorado River. Arizona hurricanes are also responsible for torrential rains in localized areas, with the state's 24-hour rainfall record— of precipitation—occurring during Hurricane Nora's landfall in 1997. The heavy rainfall can trigger extensive flash floods, {{such as the ones}} produced by the remnants of Tropical Storm Octave in 1983, or the lingering moisture from Tropical Storm Emilia in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Electronegativity is the {{tendency}} of an atom to attract electrons. An atom's electronegativity <b>is</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> both its atomic number and {{the distance between the}} valence electrons and the nucleus. The higher its electronegativity, the more an element attracts electrons. It was first proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932. In general, electronegativity increases on passing from left to right along a period, and decreases on descending a group. Hence, fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements, while caesium is the least, at least of those elements for which substantial data is available.|$|E

To help the individual, the poem explains that people must leave the time-bound world and look into their selves, and that poets must seek out a perfection, not bound by time in their images, to escape from the problems of language.|$|E
5|$|Fossils {{from the}} Pleistocene {{suggest that this}} species bred further south in Europe in the cool periods between glaciations than it does now. Its {{sensitivity}} to changing climate {{as well as to}} water table levels and the speed of vegetation growth has led to suggestions that its range <b>is</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> global warming, and the ruff might act as an indicator species for monitoring climate change. Potential threats to this species may also include outbreaks of diseases to which it is susceptible such as influenza, botulism and avian malaria.|$|E
5|$|Most of the cancer-causing {{mutations}} {{cause the}} protein to be truncated at the carboxy-terminus. The C-terminal end of folliculin has {{shown to be}} the domain through which it interacts with FNIP1, and thereby possibly the mTOR pathway. FLCN is highly conserved in vertebrates—it is very similar between many vertebrate species. The 508th amino acid, normally lysine, <b>is</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> a missense mutation in some people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. The lysine at this position {{is found to be}} conserved between invertebrate and vertebrate orthologs of folliculin, indicating {{that it is important to}} the protein's function.|$|E
