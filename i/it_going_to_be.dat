So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or is <b>it</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna {{be a little bit of}} one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E
2500|$|Jesus Freak Hideout's Kevin Hoskins {{said that}} the band [...] "continues to rock stages year after year.

Though it may not carry the lyrical depth or stellar musical creativity of other acts, it can keep your head bobbing all day long."

But will it be the most mind-blowing album you've heard this year? Definitely not. Fans of Disciple will not be disappointed, but I don't except the band to garner any new attention with this release." ...|$|E

Will we destroy rare invaluable flora and fauna before we can research and exploit their unique properties? In the end, is <b>it</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the red-barked tree that's going to hold the cure for cancer?" [...] Newman stated about the song, [...] "It's got an open-eyed beauty to it, {{looking at the world}} as a mysterious place. It's more like Pentangle than Wire! Wire have never made a track anything like it: it's in ¾ time, with acoustic guitars, bouzouki and organ. It's an innovative track for Wire – perhaps the most different. There's nothing in our catalogue that sounds anything like it, and that pleases me immensely." ...|$|E
