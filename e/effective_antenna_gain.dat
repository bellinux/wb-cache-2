40|$|Most {{theoretical}} {{studies for}} {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) wireless networks with beamforming model the actual received signal {{power as a}} product of some fixed antenna gain and the nominal received signal power. The nominal received signal power being that from an omni-directional transmission on a single input single output (SISO) link. Since the power angular spectrum is often significantly different for line of sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) links, multiplying the same antenna gain for both LOS and NLOS links leads to erroneous estimates of the actual received signal power. We quantify the difference in <b>effective</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>gain</b> for NLOS and LOS links as a function of number of dominant paths in the channel using a popular narrowband geometric channel model, when the number of antennas at the transmitter and receiver is large. We call this difference the correction factor. Using the recent New Radio (NR) 3 GPP channel model we confirm that the <b>effective</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>gain</b> for NLOS links can be about 10 dB lower than for LOS links.

40|$|Multiplexing {{efficiency}} {{has recently}} been proposed as a performance metric for characterizing the absolute efficiency of MIMO antennas in a reference channel. In this work, we generalize this metric to account for arbitrary propagation channels, so {{the impact of the}} channel can also be studied. Using the extended definition of multiplexing efficiency, the respective roles of <b>effective</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>gain</b> and signal correlation due to nonisotropic incident fields can be clearly identified. A numerical evaluation based on two MIMO terminal prototypes and four different propagation scenarios is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the generalized metric. We find that the MIMO antenna with high total antenna efficiency and good pattern diversity offers a robust multiplexing efficiency performance in all the considered propagation scenarios...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the impact of}} user effects on the {{performance}} of receive antenna diversity systems in flat Rayleigh fading channels. Three diversity combining techniques are compared: maximal ratio combining (MRC), equal gain combining (EGC), and selection combining (SC). User effects are considered in two scenarios: 1) body loss (the reduction of <b>effective</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>gain</b> due to user effects) on a single antenna, and 2) equal body loss on both antennas. The system performance is assessed in terms of mean SNR, link reliability, bit error rate of BPSK, diversity order and ergodic capacity. Our results show that body loss on a single antenna has limited (bounded) impact on system performance. In comparison, body loss on both antennas has unlimited (unbounded) impact and can severely degrade system performance. Our results also show that with increasing body loss on a single antenna the performance of EGC drops faster than that of MRC and SC. When body loss on a single antenna is larger than a certain level, EGC is not a “sub-optimal” method anymore and has worse performance than SC...|$|E
40|$|International audienceReverberation {{chambers}} (RC) are cost-effective {{tools for}} evaluating Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Over-The-Air (OTA) communication systems performance. In {{order to assess}} their performance, several figures-of-merit (FOM) are made use of, such as diversity gain, which is typically used to present {{the effectiveness of a}} diversity antenna system.

In this contribution, we present an analysis of the dependence of the <b>effective</b> <b>antenna</b> diversity <b>gain</b> on the RMS delay spread of a wireless channel by means of a multi-antenna OTA communication system using a QPSK modulation inside an RC.

40|$|We examine here {{a number}} of {{variations}} of Reflector Impulse Radiating Antennas (IRAs) that are useful when the feed arms are flexible. When feed arms are built using a conducting fabric or membrane, {{the end of the}} feed arms are often contained entirely within the radius of a circular reflector, to keep the feed arms under tension. This displaces the feed arms {{toward the center of the}} reflector from the standard position where the charge center of the feed arms intersects the reflector rim. We investigate here the effect of that feed arm displacement while varying the feed impedance and feed arm position. We also investigate the effect of shaping the reflector to exclude the portion of the aperture that contributes destructively to the radiated field. For each of these configurations, we calculate the <b>effective</b> height, <b>antenna</b> <b>gain,</b> and sidelobe level. In this paper, we consider {{a number of}} configurations of the Impulse Radiating Antenna (IRA) that are useful with flexible feed arms. These IRA variations include the Para-IRA [1] and the Membrane IRA [2].

5000|$|<b>Antenna</b> <b>gain</b> {{is usually}} {{defined as the}} ratio of the power {{produced}} by the antenna from a far-field source on the antenna's beam axis to the power produced by a hypothetical lossless isotropic antenna, which is equally sensitive to signals from all directions. [...] Usually this ratio is expressed in decibels, and these units are referred to as [...] "decibels-isotropic" [...] (dBi). An alternative definition compares the received power to the power received by a lossless half-wave dipole antenna, in which case the units are written as dBd.

40|$|Two {{uncertain}} {{factors affecting}} a telecommunication system’s performance are <b>effective</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>gain</b> and system noise temperature. For an Earth-geostationary satellite–Moon system, they {{are attributed to}} the atmospheric attenuation and ra-diation. In the super-high frequency band, the attenuations are mostly weather re-lated and have the same values for both upward- and downward-propagating signals, while brightness temperatures have different effects for upward- and downward-looking antennas. In this study, six link scenarios for this system are analyzed. Analysis of atmospheric attenuation and brightness temperatures for each link are presented. This study also discusses the general methodology for determining the noise temperature for a receiving antenna pointing to a blackbody of a given angular extent. A set of curves is presented that is independent of the sizes and brightness temperatures of black bodies.

Paraboloidal dish antennas, ranging from 20 feet to 85 feet in diameter, can be calibrated using a total-power conventional RF receiver.

40|$|The zero-forcing {{algorithm}} (min-norm algorithm) {{is one of}} {{the proposed}} methods for downlink beamforming. This algorithm steers the nulls towards interferers and the main beam towards the desired user provided the angles of arrival of these signals are known to the basestation. However, downlink adaptive arrays use additional power when they are required to include null steering in their beam patterns. This excessive transmitted power reduces the <b>effective</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>gain,</b> increases interference in other directions and has implications on the dimensioning of the power amplifiers feeding the antenna elements. In addition, the power distribution among the antenna array elements is no longer equal. The design ratings for the power amplifiers (PAs) on each element can differ by up to 2. 9 dB. A distributed amplifier design could solve this problem. This thesis investigates the trade-off of null depth with transmitted power and utility by modifying the zero-forcing algorithm. The performance or utility of the antenna is defined here as the probability that it can accommodate a given angular scenario between the desired user and interfering sources without transmitting excessive power. A - 10 dB null increases antenna utility by 6 % when steering a single null and 17 % when steering 2 nulls if the excessive transmit power is held below 3 dB for a 4 -element antenna array. In this work, {{a modified version of the}} min-norm algorithm was used to design the antenna weights from angle of arrival information...|$|E
