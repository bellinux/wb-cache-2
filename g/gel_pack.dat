40|$|Incisional, {{chest and}} sternal pain is {{prevalent}} in patients after cardiac surgery. If pain is not properly managed it may prevent patients from performing {{activities such as}} deep breathing and coughing (DB & C) which are important for preventing postoperative respiratory complications. There is a scarcity of research about the nonpharmacologic modalities for treating post cardiac incisional and sternal pain. Of these modalities, cold therapy is a strategy {{that has been used}} effectively over many decades {{in a number of areas}} including orthopedic surgery. The beneficial effects of cold therapy for pain management have been widely documented and the side effects are minimal, yet its use is limited in post-surgical cardiac patients. Nurses can have an active role in relieving patients' surgical pain with cold therapy. Presently, there are no studies in the literature that specifically address cold therapy for sternotomy pain management following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The objectives of this study were: (1) to evaluate the effects of cold therapy on pain associated with DB & C post cardiac surgery; (2) to identify sensations from the patients' perspective when cold in the form of a <b>gel</b> <b>pack</b> is applied to the median sternotomy chest incision before DB & C; (3) to identify patients' preferences for gel or no <b>gel</b> <b>pack</b> application. A crossover research design was utilized and each patient served as their own control. Participants underwent four sessions of DB & C every two hours on postoperative day two. Two sessions were preceded by cold application and two sessions were without cold application. At the end of the four sessions of DB & C, patients were asked about their preferences for gel or no <b>gel</b> <b>pack</b> application. Pain scores associated with DB & C were significantly decreased with the application of cold therapy (F= 28. 69, p<. 001). Most participants preferred using the <b>gel</b> <b>pack</b> before performing the DB & C exercises (n= 22; 69 %) and there were 2 (6 %) participants who preferred DB & C without the <b>gel</b> <b>pack,</b> the other participants (n= 8) had no preference. The sensations experienced were similar among all participants, most described coolness (n= 9; 28 %) or cold (n= 23, 72 %). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that cold therapy is useful for managing patients' pain associated with DB & C following CABO surgery. Cold therapy is low risk, low cost and can be easily integrated into nursing practice since cold packs are easily accessible in most hospitals. With nurses' initial supervision, cold therapy is a safe and effective pain management modality that gives patients an active role in pain management. Further research is recommended on the application of other cold modalities such as the use of ice chips as the cold source before DB & C as well as performing the intervention earlier after the surgery on postoperative day one...|$|E

The product environment {{had to be}} maintained between 0 and 8 degrees C throughout transit until delivery. Straightforward, low cost and simplified shipping arrangements were sought that would be appropriate for small-scale Phase I clinical trial activities. A laboratory test defined an optimal three frozen <b>gel</b> <b>pack</b> configuration to maintain refrigerated environmental conditions for dummy product packs in a single type and size of insulated shipper. The internal environment was temperature monitored at 30 -min intervals in all tests. Twelve Glasgow to London transits were then studied over 2 years to include all seasonal temperature variations. A configuration using three frozen gel packs and 4 h pre-chill of the transit container maintained the internal environment at 0 - 8 degrees C for up to 48 h during autumn, winter and spring. A modified four frozen <b>gel</b> <b>pack</b> configuration was suitable for summer transit. Thus cold shipment verification was successfully carried out for a small-scale distribution operation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Therapeutic {{hypothermia}} (TH) following perinatal asphyxial encephalopathy in term infants improves {{mortality and}} neurodevelopmental outcome. In Europe, most neonatal units perform active cooling whereas in Switzerland passive cooling is predominantly used. AIMS: (i) To {{determine how many}} infants were cooled within the last 5 years in Switzerland, (ii) to assess the cooling methods, (iii) to evaluate the variation of temperature of different cooling methods, and (iv) {{to evaluate the use}} of neuromonitoring. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PATIENTS: Notes of all cooled term infants between March 2005 and December 2010 in 9 perinatal and two paediatric intensive care centres were retrospectively reviewed. Active cooling was compared to passive cooling alone and to passive cooling in combination with <b>gel</b> <b>packs.</b> RESULTS: 150 infants were cooled. Twenty-seven (18. 2 %) were cooled actively, 34 (23 %) passively and 87 (58. 8 %) passively in combination with <b>gel</b> <b>packs.</b> Variation of temperature was significantly different between the three methods. Passive cooling had a significant higher variation of temperature (SD of 0. 89) than both passive cooling in combination with <b>gel</b> <b>packs</b> (SD of 0. 79) and active cooling (SD of 0. 76). aEEG before TH was obtained in 35. 8 % of the infants and 86. 5 % had full EEG.

40|$|Accessory cooling {{devices have}} been {{developed}} to protect firefighters (FF) from suffering an exertional heat illness by attenuating the rise in core body temperature. Head cooling (HC) via a cold <b>gel</b> <b>pack</b> placed inside the helmet is one cooling mechanism marketed to FF, but the research regarding its efficacy is limited. PURPOSE: To investigate the physiological and perceived effects of HC during simulated firefighting activity (FFA). METHODS: Participants (males; 40 ± 8 y; 168 ± 7 cm; 91. 8 ± 14. 2 kg) were randomly assigned to either the HC group (n= 9), who completed FFA while wearing a cold <b>gel</b> <b>pack</b> inside their helmet, or the control (CON) group (n= 10), who received no accessory cooling during FFA. FF completed four FFA stations in full turnout gear and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) (23. 3 ± 1. 4 kg). FFA stations lasted 15 min and included an obstacle course, a high-rise drill, a two-story search and rescue drill, and car extrication. Stations were completed in random order. After each station, FF replaced their air cylinder and HC replaced their gel pack; FF then completed a different station. After every two stations, the FF rested for 15 min in the shade by removing their turnout gear and SCBA and drinking water ad libitum. Gastrointestinal temperature (GI), heart rate (HR), Stroop Test interference score (ST), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), perceived thermal strain (PTS), and hydration status were measured. Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to compare groups across time. RESULTS: No significant demographic differences were found between groups (p> 0. 05). GI (39. 18 ± 0. 49 °C) and HR (163 ± 22 bpm) increased during FFA. No significant interactions were found for GI, HR, ST, PTS, or RPE (p> 0. 05). There were no differences in sweat loss (2. 5 ± 0. 8 L), hypohydration (0. 9 ± 0. 8 %), or post FFA urine specific gravity (1. 020 ± 0. 008) between groups (p> 0. 05). Weak relationships were noted between perceived thermal sensation and gastrointestinal temperature (r=. 248). CONCLUSION: HC did not attenuate the rise in GI or reduce HR during FFA. The discrepancy between perception and actual body temperature may be dangerous for FF, as it may allow them to work beyond their central drive and the critical GI threshold. Amy L.

S. Department of Energy Environmental Management (DOE-EM) sites. Issues of worker health and safety are the main concern, followed by cost. Two lines of action were explored: innovative Personal Cooling Systems (PCS) and Personal Monitoring Equipment (PME). PME refers to sensors affixed to the worker that warn of an approaching heat stress condition, thereby preventing it. Three types of cooling systems were investigated: Pre-Chilled or Forced-Air System (PCFA), Umbilical Fluid-Chilled System (UFCS), and Passive Vest System (PVS). Of these, the UFCS leads the way. The PVS or <b>Gel</b> <b>pack</b> vest lagged due to a limited cooling duration. And the PCFA or chilled liquid air supply was cumbersome and required an expensive and complex recharge system. The UFCS {{in the form of}} the Personal Ice Cooling System (PICS) performed exceptionally. The technology uses a chilled liquid circulating undergarment and a Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) external pump and ice reservoir. The system is moderately expensive, but the recharge is low-tech and inexpensive enough to offset the cost. There are commercially available PME that can be augmented to meet the DOE's heat stress alleviation need. The technology is costly, in excess of $ 4, 000 per unit. Workers easily ignore the alarm. The benefit to health & safety is indirect so can be overlooked. A PCS is a more justifiable expenditure...|$|E
30|$|A lot of {{researchers}} {{have studied the}} propagation and blocking effectiveness of PPGs in both high permeable reservoirs and fractured layers (Bai et al. 2007 a, b; Zhang and Bai 2011). Elsharafi and Bai (2012) determined that the best PPG treatments occurred when the PPG could simply penetrate through the high permeable layers without damaging the low permeable formations. Elsharafi and Bai (2015) found that the permeability of the <b>gel</b> <b>pack</b> in the fluid channels depended upon the particle strength, particle size, brine concentration, and the load pressure. The relationship among the cumulative injection volumes against time {{is needed to determine}} the damage to low permeable reservoirs (Ershaghi et al. 1986; Vetter et al. 1987). The cumulative injection volume value was used because if the core were damaged the flow rate will not be constant. As a result, the curves (the relationship between the cumulative filtration volume and the injection time) will not be straight lines. Filtration tests have been used in the past to study the damage of cores fully saturated with brine, oil, or residual oil while injecting suspended particles, oily water, or a combination of both into these cores (Hsi et al. 1994; Coleman and McLelland 1994; Al-Abduwani et al. 2005; Ali et al. 2009). The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to study the effect of strong PPGs on low permeable zones/areas in mature reservoirs, including the effects of rock permeability, salinity, particle size of PPGs, PPG types, pore throat size in cores, gel strength, and the injection pump pressure. This paper is also needed to find out how to minimize the formation damage when the PPGs were used for water shut-off or conformance control treatment in mature reservoirs. This work used both filtration tests and load pressure tests to find out if the PPGs will damage the low permeable zones/areas. The damage or penetration caused by PPGs on unswept low permeability oil-rich zones could be effectively controlled by controlling particle gel strength, gel type, particle size, and brine concentration. This paper’s results can be used to properly select the gel particles that will not damage the formation for the best particle gel treatment.|$|E
