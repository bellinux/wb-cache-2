5|$|Two ballets caused great <b>excitement</b> <b>in</b> Paris in the 1830s. In November 1831, Meyerbeer's opera Robert le diable had {{its first}} performance. It {{featured}} a short ballet called Ballet of the Nuns. In this little ballet, scantily clad nuns rise from their graves to dance wantonly in the moonlight. The public loved this little supernatural ballet.|$|E

5|$|The {{start of}} 2011 was {{highlighted}} by United's first selection in the SuperDraft, {{where they had}} the third overall pick in the first round. For the third pick, United drafted University of Akron standout Perry Kitchen, who was a key cog for the Akron Zips' championship-run in the College Cup the previous month. Club management expressed immense <b>excitement</b> <b>in</b> signing Kitchen, with head coach Ben Olsen and manager David Kasper sharing {{that if they had}} the first overall pick, they would have signed Kitchen.|$|E
5|$|Further {{expansion}} moves {{were also}} made in other global markets during 2012. The African market saw a new agreement with Grand Parade Investments of South Africa to enter Africa's largest economy, with restaurants opening in 2013. In Europe, Burger King {{returned to the}} French market in 2012 with an agreement with multinational operator Autogrill, a move that has met with some <b>excitement</b> <b>in</b> the country. The chain left the country in 1997, closing its 22 franchised and 17 corporate locations after a poorly executed entry into the market that left it unable to compete against McDonald's and local chain Quick. The partnership with Autogrill is a move to consolidate Burger King's presence in travel plazas along major highways in France, Italy, Poland and other European nations.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} {{was unveiled}} on Whit Monday, 16 May 1921, by Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), with Lutyens in attendance. At the unveiling ceremony, Lord Fortescue {{gave a speech}} in which he estimated that 11,600 {{men and women from}} Devon had been killed while serving in the war. He later stated that some 63,700 (8,000 regulars, 36,700 volunteers, and 19,000 conscripts) had served in the armed forces. The names of the fallen were recorded on a roll of honour, of which three copies were made: one for Exeter Cathedral, one to be held by the county council, and one which the Prince of Wales placed in a hollow in the base of the war memorial. The prince's visit generated considerable <b>excitement</b> <b>in</b> the area. Thousands of people lined the street to greet his motorcade and shops on the High Street hung out banners with welcoming messages. After the unveiling, Edward spent ten days touring the local area.|$|E

5|$|This {{evidence}} that giant reptiles had lived on Earth {{in the past}} caused great <b>excitement</b> <b>in</b> scientific circles, and even among some segments of the general public. Buckland did describe the jaw of a small primitive mammal, Phascolotherium, that {{was found in the}} same strata as Megalosaurus. This discovery, known as the Stonesfield mammal, was a much discussed anomaly. Cuvier at first thought it was a marsupial, but Buckland later realized it was a primitive placental mammal. Due to its small size and primitive nature, Buckland did not believe it invalidated the overall pattern of an age of reptiles, when the largest and most conspicuous animals had been reptiles rather than mammals.|$|E
5|$|To counter Cleveland’s {{image of}} {{superior}} morality, Republicans discovered reports that Cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child {{while he was}} a lawyer in Buffalo, New York, and chanted “Ma, Ma, where’s my Pa?”—to which the Democrats, after Cleveland had been elected, appended, “Gone to the White House, Ha! Ha! Ha!” Cleveland admitted to paying child support in 1874 to Maria Crofts Halpin, the woman who claimed he fathered her child named Oscar Folsom Cleveland. Halpin was involved with several men at the time, including Cleveland’s friend and law partner, Oscar Folsom, for whom the child was also named. Cleveland did not know which man was the father, and is believed to have assumed responsibility because he was the only bachelor among them. At the same time, Democratic operatives accused Blaine and his wife of not having been married when their eldest son, Stanwood, was born in 1851; this rumor was false, however, and caused little <b>excitement</b> <b>in</b> the campaign.|$|E
5|$|To promote The Rocketeer, Disney made tie-in {{endorsements}} with Pizza Hut and M's/Mars candies. An extensive {{product line}} followed of computer games, toys, posters, trading cards, pins, patches, buttons, T-shirts, and children's clothing, licensed {{to coincide with}} the film's opening. The studio also spent a further $19 million on TV advertising alone. A television special documentary, titled The Rocketeer: <b>Excitement</b> <b>in</b> the Air, was broadcast on the Disney Channel in June 1991. That same month, a young adult novelization written by Peter David was published by Bantam Books, while a similar novelization by Ron Fontes, for younger readers was published by Scholastic Books for Disney Press.|$|E

25|$|While recent {{evidence}} suggesting that American ivory-billed woodpeckers still exist in the wild has caused <b>excitement</b> <b>in</b> the ornithology community, no similar evidence exists for the Cuban ivory-billed bird, believed to be extinct since the last sighting in the late 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Dawkins {{finishes}} {{by arguing}} that atheism is not a recipe for despair but just the opposite; rather than viewing life as a trial that must be endured before reaching a mythical hereafter, an atheist sees this life as all we have, and by disclaiming a next life can take more <b>excitement</b> <b>in</b> this one. Atheism, Dawkins concludes, is life-affirming {{in a way that}} religion can never be.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{effect of the}} February Revolution was a widespread atmosphere of elation and <b>excitement</b> <b>in</b> Petrograd. On , a provisional government was announced.

A further poll published 27 April 2007, shows Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats at 34% and 3% respectively compared to Fine Gael and Labour at 31% and 10%. A promise by the Labour Party, at their February 2007 party conference of {{a cut in}} the basic rate of income tax, paid by 80% of workers, from 20% to 18% created some <b>excitement</b> <b>in</b> political and media circles. Income tax cuts by the Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrats government had concentrated on the top rate of tax and Labour were able to portray their proposal as progressive to the discomfiture of Fianna Fáil.|$|E
