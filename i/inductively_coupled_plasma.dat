5|$|An atom can be ionized by {{removing}} {{one of its}} electrons. The electric charge causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a magnetic field. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field {{is determined by the}} mass of the atom. The mass spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include <b>inductively</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>plasma</b> atomic emission spectroscopy and <b>inductively</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>plasma</b> mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.|$|E

25|$|A third popular type of reactor is the electrodeless. This uses an RF coil {{wrapped around}} the glass apparatus, which then uses a radio {{frequency}} generator to form the plasma inside of the housing {{without the use of}} direct electrodes (see <b>Inductively</b> <b>Coupled</b> <b>Plasma).</b> The polymer can then be deposited as it is pushed through this RF coil toward the vacuum end of the apparatus.

25|$|<b>Inductively</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>plasma</b> (ICP) {{sources are}} used {{primarily}} for cation {{analysis of a}} wide array of sample types. In this source, a plasma that is electrically neutral overall, but that has had a substantial fraction of its atoms ionized by high temperature, is used to atomize introduced sample molecules and to further strip the outer electrons from those atoms. The plasma is usually generated from argon gas, since the first ionization energy of argon atoms is higher than the first of any other elements except He, O, F and Ne, but lower than the second ionization energy of all except the most electropositive metals. The heating is achieved by a radio-frequency current passed through a coil surrounding the plasma.|$|E
25|$|Arsenic {{has been}} linked to {{epigenetic}} changes, heritable changes in gene expression that occur without changes in DNA sequence. These include DNA methylation, histone modification, and RNA interference. Toxic levels of arsenic cause significant DNA hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes p16 and p53, thus increasing risk of carcinogenesis. These epigenetic events have been studied in vitro using human kidney cells and in vivo using rat liver cells and peripheral blood leukocytes in humans. <b>Inductively</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>plasma</b> mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is used to detect precise levels of intracellular arsenic and other arsenic bases involved in epigenetic modification of DNA.

The measurements also reveal a weak azimuthal dependence of the global plasma parameters at low values of the input RF power, which was earlier predicted theoretically. The azimuthal dependence of the global plasma parameters vanishes at high input RF powers. Moreover, under certain conditions, the plasma becomes unstable due to spontaneous transitions between low-density (electrostatic, E) and high-density (electromagnetic, H) operating modes. Excellent uniformity of high-density plasmas makes the plasma reactor promising for various plasma processing applications and surface engineering...|$|R

The crystallinity and microstructure properties (including crystal structure, crystal volume fraction, surface morphology, etc.) of this nanostructured phase of Si can be effectively tailored in broad ranges for different device applications by simply varying the inductive rf power density from 25. 0 to 41. 7 mW/cm 3. In particular, at a moderate rf power density of 41. 7 mW/cm 3, the nc-Si films feature a very high growth rate of 2. 37 nm/s, a high crystalline fraction of 86 %, a vertically aligned columnar structure with the preferential (111) growth orientation and embedded Si quantum dots, {{as well as a}} clean, smooth and defect-free interface.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of <b>inductively</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>plasmas</b> for spectroscopic purposes {{has been studied}} extensively in the past. However, many questions about production and loss of electrons, which have a major effect on this behavior, are unanswered. Power interruption is a powerful diagnostic method to study such processes. This paper presents time resolved Thomson scattering measurements of the electron density ne and temperature Te in an <b>inductively</b> <b>coupled</b> argon <b>plasma</b> during and after power interruption.
