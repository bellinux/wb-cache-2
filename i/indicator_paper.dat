40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{assessment}} of farm management indicators and argues that typologies are a necessary tool for comprehensive environmental assessments. In the paper Andersen et al., [(2004 a). Farming and the Environment in the European Community-using agricultural statistics to provide farm management <b>indicators.</b> <b>Paper</b> presented at OECD Expert meeting, March 2004, New Zealand. (Ist of February 2006) ] presented at the OECD expert meeting on farm management indicators in New Zealand in March 2004, a set of farm management indicators was presented {{in the framework of}} a typology of grazing livestock farming systems in the EU- 15 (includes all Member States of the European Union before 2004). The present paper presents new results on farm management indicators within the framework of an extended typology for all farming sectors. It presents an environmentally oriented extension to the EU typology of farms currently used for assessing the situation of farming within the European Union. The extended typology is tested in relation to emerging policy issues such as environmental sustainability and rural viability by analysing some of the farm management indicators suggested in Andersen et al., [(2004 a). Farming and the Environment in the European Community-using agricultural statistics to provide farm management <b>indicators.</b> <b>Paper</b> presented at OECD Expert meeting, March 2004, New Zealand.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the {{changing}} behavior of two counting methods (whole counting and whole-normalized counting) and inflation rate at country level research productivity and impact. For this, publication data on tribology research published between 1998 and 2012 from SCOPUS has been used. Only internationally collaborated papers are considered for comparison between two counting methods. The result of correlation tests shows that there is highly correlation in all the four indicators between the two counting methods.

It was impregnated by 3 -phenyl- 2, 6 -dimercapto- 1, 4 -thiopyrone or by precipitate of its complex with copper(II). Besides Cu(II) can be replaced by the Au(III) ion tested in the composition of this complex. The concentration ranges for Au(III) determination were equal to 0. 02 − 2 mg·L − 1 or 4 − 590 mg·L − 1, respectively, in the presence of excess of the transition and noble metals.

After 11 dairy cows underwent rumenocentesis, the clinical status of those animals was evaluated daily, and cows were slaughtered as well as pathologically [...] anatomically examined on day 7.
