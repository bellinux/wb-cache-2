5|$|Anti-inflammatory {{drugs are}} often used to control the effects of inflammation. Glucocorticoids are the most {{powerful}} of these drugs; however, these <b>drugs</b> <b>can</b> have many undesirable side effects, such as central obesity, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and their use must be tightly controlled. Lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs {{are often used}} in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{interacts with}} many {{commonly}} used drugs, and the metabolism of warfarin varies greatly between patients. Some foods {{have also been}} reported to interact with warfarin. Apart from the metabolic interactions, highly protein bound <b>drugs</b> <b>can</b> displace warfarin from serum albumin and cause {{an increase in the}} INR. This makes finding the correct dosage difficult, and accentuates the need of monitoring; when initiating a medication that is known to interact with warfarin (e.g. simvastatin), INR checks are increased or dosages adjusted until a new ideal dosage is found.|$|E
5|$|Special {{investigations}} may be {{indicated to}} rule out other causes of oral ulceration. These include blood tests to exclude anemia, deficiencies of iron, folate or vitamin B12 or celiac disease. However, the nutritional deficiencies may be latent and the peripheral blood picture may appear relatively normal. Some suggest that screening for celiac disease should form part of the routine work up for individuals complaining of recurrent oral ulceration. Many of the systemic diseases cause other symptoms apart from oral ulceration, which {{is in contrast to}} aphthous stomatitis where there is isolated oral ulceration. Patch testing may be indicated if allergies are suspected (e.g. a strong relationship between certain foods and episodes of ulceration). Several <b>drugs</b> <b>can</b> cause oral ulceration (e.g. nicorandil), and a trial substitution to an alternative drug may highlight a causal relationship.|$|E

5|$|Toxicology testing, {{also known}} as safety testing, is {{conducted}} by pharmaceutical companies testing drugs, or by contract animal testing facilities, such as Huntingdon Life Sciences, {{on behalf of a}} wide variety of customers. According to 2005 EU figures, around one million animals are used every year in Europe in toxicology tests; which are about 10% of all procedures. According to Nature, 5,000 animals are used for each chemical being tested, with 12,000 needed to test pesticides. The tests are conducted without anesthesia, because interactions between <b>drugs</b> <b>can</b> affect how animals detoxify chemicals, and may interfere with the results.|$|E
5|$|Colonization with H. pylori is not {{a disease}} in and of itself, but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for H. pylori is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia, not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test, stool antigen test, or with the carbon urea breath test (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. Some <b>drugs</b> <b>can</b> affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>drugs</b> <b>can</b> cause mouth ulcers {{as a side}} effect. Common {{examples}} are alendronate (a bisphosphonate, commonly prescribed for osteoporosis), cytotoxic drugs (e.g. methotrexate, i.e. chemotherapy), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, nicorandil (may be prescribed for angina) and propylthiouracil (e.g. used for hyperthyroidism). Some recreational <b>drugs</b> <b>can</b> cause ulceration, e.g. cocaine.|$|E

25|$|Given the benign {{nature of}} the {{condition}} and the low seizure frequency, treatment is often unnecessary. If treatment is warranted or preferred by the child {{and his or her}} family, antiepileptic <b>drugs</b> <b>can</b> usually control the seizures easily. Carbamazepine is the most frequently used first-line drug, but many other antiepileptic drugs, including valproate, phenytoin, gabapentin, levetiracetam and sultiame have been found effective as well. Bedtime dosing is advised by some. Treatment can be short and <b>drugs</b> <b>can</b> almost certainly be discontinued after two years without seizures and with normal EEG findings, perhaps even earlier.|$|E
