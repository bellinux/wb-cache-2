5|$|Sia {{is one of}} them. She comes in, singer-songwriter, {{she just}} writes the most {{beautiful}} amazing ballads. Now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale {{with a lot of}} more dance-driven stuff, and she is just an incredible singer. She came in and she just writes such serious songs, I was like 'Oh she is gunna be such a serious person, and I'm nervous to meet her, and I just want her to get me and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into this world of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that,</b> that's the best experience.|$|E

She and [...] are both saying to the world, 'Prove us wrong: If God is kindness and love, make me believe in God.

500|$|Jackson {{also spoke}} about O'Neal in 2001 with Rabbi Shmuley. He {{described}} holding hands with her: [...] "I was, like, in heaven. It {{was the most}} magical thing. It was better than kissing her, {{it was better than}} anything." [...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I remember we went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And I was watching the band, I was sitting there, and underneath the table, she was holding my hand, and I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. It was all I needed.

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the episode, several physicians played a game of baseball to cheer up. Rater called it [...] "her favorite scene", explaining: [...] "I loved the scene where Owen, Derek and Mark take Cristina, Meredith and Lexie to the baseball field. This {{is one of the first}} times Owen has seen Cristina's intensity. And <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> he makes her leave the hospital, focus on something else. That's why he's so good for her. The scene was actually inspired by Shonda saying, let's do a scene where they're all playing baseball. But when I finally saw it, it makes me want to write more scenes like that, with our doctors outside of the hospital, little glimpses of them in real life." ...|$|E

The concept of the video shows Mars {{having a good time}} with his bandmates, doing things like smoking, drinking beer and playing games. He is also seen singing the song with his band at a club. The video has a vintage style reminiscent of VHS tapes. Mars explained to MTV News, [...] "The concept is just old-fashioned fun. No story line, it's not me singing to a girl, you get a good sense of what you're going to get live... It's very VHS-y. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> man, it takes me back to my childhood, when the tracking is off and the color is off, there's a beauty in that.

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{columnist}} Abby West praised Fischer's [...] "masterful" [...] performance, {{writing that}} it [...] "really {{is nice to}} see Pam coming into her own... And <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> she didn't inhibit herself when Jim walked in — she just ran right up and hugged him." [...] West also highlighted Carell and Helms, explaining that with the former, [...] "Michael is never completely loathsome — because Steve Carell imbues him with such vulnerability." [...] AOL TV writer Michael Sciannamea also enjoyed Helms' performance, believing that [...] "the competition between Andy and Dwight will surely make for some classic moments." [...] Sciannamea concluded his review, [...] "What makes this show so great is that the supporting players {{have a chance to}} shine at the right moments. I thought Stanley's reactions to the whole situation were hysterical, and Creed is just great. He deserves some more airtime." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2015, Cornell openly said in {{interview}} with Total Guitar {{that he was}} quite eager to reunite with Audioslave: [...] "I {{think it would be}} great.

It would be a really amazing experience just to get back and work with the same guys again." [...] Soon after, Morello said that he's interested in working with Cornell again, remembering their 2014 Seattle performance with great fondness: [...] "I love Chris and consider him a great friend. The Hall of Fame jam was nice, but a little chaotic. Playing with him in Seattle, that was just fantastic. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> guy. He's one of the most talented vocalists in the history of vocalists. And {{to be able to play}} the songs that we wrote together, it was awesome and so much fun. I hope we do something like that again." ...|$|E

Southpark!!", Khloé Kardashian wrote {{she did not know}} about her appearance on the show until she suddenly received numerous messages on her Twitter page. Khloé also said she found the scene funny, and laughed at how unattractively she and her sisters were portrayed, although she said the Bruce Jenner cartoon looked very realistic.

[...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood commented that [...] "The idea of Lisa being unpopular in the light of a new girl in the school hallways is not new (see [...] "Lisa's Rival") but it is done here with such class," [...] concluding of Homer's treatment that [...] "this is an episode which shows that even he can find interesting ways to do things." [...] Wesley Mead noted, in a review of the tenth season that the episode [...] "might deal with familiar territory ("Lisa's Rival", anyone?), but it doesn't feel like a retread, and is also home to a superbly realised subplot that sees Homer and Bart go into the grease business." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, OutKast's {{original}} {{record label}} Arista Records was restructured under the Jive label group. During their hiatus, Big Boi and André 3000 were pressured by Jive {{to produce an}} OutKast album {{instead of focusing on}} their solo work. In July 2009, Big Boi left Jive Records, following creative differences and the label's unwillingness to release and promote his solo album. According to Big Boi, Jive gave him an ultimatum to shop the album elsewhere. In an interview for GQ, he discussed his release from Jive and his discontent with the label for proposing he record a cover of rapper Lil Wayne's [...] "Lollipop", stating [...] "They told me to go in and make my version of Lil Wayne's Lollipop! <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> song... But how you gonna tell me to go bite another MCs style?... That's the highest form of disrespect ever. So that's when I wanted to get off Jive. And the only honorable thing they've done is allow me to do that". Big Boi expressed that Jive viewed its intended singles as not [...] "radio-friendly" [...] and the album as [...] "a piece of art, and they didn't {{know what to do with}} it".|$|E
500|$|Jenny was {{negatively}} received amongst TV critics and viewers {{from the very}} first episode after she cheated on her nice guy boyfriend, Tim, with another woman for no clear reason. This prompted Chaiken to implement a series of changes to Jenny to help make her more likable. Chaiken defended Jenny stating: [...] "I'm well aware of the response to Jenny. I love the character, and <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> people are passionate about her. I know {{there are a lot of}} people who just can't stand her. And that's why it's so important to have that character in the mix." [...] Kirshner defended Jenny stating: [...] "Jenny's a very controversial character. I think the great thing about her is the fact that she's so flawed." [...] During season two Jenny is seen coming out, getting her hair cut and becoming best friends with Shane McCutcheon (Katherine Moennig). AfterEllen.com stated that Jenny cutting off her hair was a defining moment in her development because it also symbolized her cutting all of the bad stuff that happened before out of her life. Jenny's transition continued into season three, Chaiken stated: [...] "We find Jenny coming together, I predict this [...] that Jenny will be more likable and accessible to the audience than she has ever been.

500|$|Many critics {{specifically}} praised Duvall's performance. Sterritt {{called it}} [...] "one {{of the most}} finely wrought achievements to reach the screen in recent memory." [...] In Corliss's description, [...] "Duvall's aging face, a road map of dead ends and dry gulches, can accommodate rage or innocence or any ironic shade in between. As Mac he avoids both melodrama and condescension, finding climaxes in each small step toward rehabilitation, each new responsibility shouldered." [...] Ansen said, [...] "Robert Duvall does another of his extraordinary disappearing acts. He vanishes totally inside the character of Mac Sledge." [...] Maslin said he [...] "so thoroughly transformed into Mac that he even walks with a Texan's rolling gait"; she also complimented the performances of the supporting cast. According to a review in People, [...] "Duvall gives it everything he has, which is saying a great deal. His beery singing voice is a revelation, and his unfussy, brightly burnished acting is the kind for which awards were invented." [...] The review also described Betty Buckley as [...] "bitchy and brilliant". Duvall was praised as well for pulling off his first true romantic role; the actor said of the response, [...] "This is the only film where I've heard people say I'm sexy. It's real romantic. Rural romantic. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> part almost more than anything." ...|$|E
500|$|There was {{a strong}} {{reaction}} from the show's viewers. Adler said, [...] "I've heard {{from a lot of}} fans how important this character is for them because it's important to watch the internal struggle, the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted." [...] He wants Karofsky to [...] "accept himself and come out because [...] it would be a beacon of hope for everyone else who's struggling", and noted, [...] "people do get hope from Glee." [...] He also said, [...] "I think [...] trusts me to do what I'm doing with the character, which is one heck of a compliment from him." [...] Murphy has indicated a preference for positive future developments, and said in early January 2011, [...] "This show is by nature optimistic and I think a character like Karofsky could turn to booze or pills or alcohol and kill themselves or do something dark. But I also love Max and <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> character and I sorta want that character to have a happy ending." [...] At one point in the bullying storyline, Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt, a scene that Adler characterized as [...] "very powerful. Chilling, terrifying, horrifying, yet, at the same time, heartbreaking. … Because there are kids who have messaged me since that episode saying they used to hear that line spoken to them {{day in and day out}} at school", and they dreaded school because of it.|$|E
500|$|According to series creator Pendleton Ward, the show's {{style was}} {{influenced}} by his time attending the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) and his experiences working {{as a writer and}} storyboard artist on The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack. In an interview with Animation World Network, Ward said he strives to combine the series' subversive humor with [...] "beautiful" [...] moments, using Hayao Miyazaki's film My Neighbor Totoro as inspiration. Ward has also named Home Movies and Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist as influences, largely because both shows are [...] "relaxing" [...] and feature [...] "conversational dialogue that feels natural [...] not over the top [...] cartoony and shrill". Ward described the show as a [...] "dark comedy"; he said [...] "dark comedies are my favorite, because <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> feeling – being happy and scared at the same time. It's my favorite way to feel – when I'm {{on the edge of my}} seat but I'm happy, that sense of conflicting emotions. And there's a lot of that in the show, I think." [...] Executive producer Fred Seibert compared the show's animation style to that of Felix the Cat and various Max Fleischer cartoons, but said that its world is also equally inspired by Dungeons and Dragons and video games. Ward intends the show's world to have a certain physical logic instead of [...] "cartoony slapstick"; even though magic exists in the story, the show's writers try to create an internal consistency in how the characters interact with the world.|$|E
500|$|Gillian Anderson has {{described}} [...] "Bad Blood" [...] {{as one of}} her favorites of the series, commenting [...] "Oh, yes! <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>that</b> episode. As far as I'm concerned it's one of our best ever. I think it really showed how well David and I can work together".|$|R
