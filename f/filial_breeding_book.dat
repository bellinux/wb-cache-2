40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of the growth of cold-blooded stallions in pig breeding test rearing houses. The Czech Republic has set up three pig breeding test rearing houses. A total of 96 stallions were measured with 14 body measurements and they were also weighed whilst alive. Statistically significant differences were detected between breeds as well as between age groups when evaluating the intensity of growth of all measured body size and body weight. In most body sizes there were the biggest Silesian Norics horses (SN). At the age of {{two and a half years}} they stagnated growth in chest circumference, the circumference of the tibia and sternum height, even though it is stated in the Rules and Regulation of <b>breeding</b> <b>book</b> that SN mature between 5 - 6 years of age. During the evaluation there were no statistically significant differences between rearing houses. Stallions from the rearing house of Proseč prevailed in growth usually at the beginning of rearing, and later stallions from the rearing house of Dvorka at the age of one and a half year grew most. Stallions in the rearing house of Humňany had the lowest WHS, WHT and CC. The smallest variances of individual body size from the three studied cold-blooded breeds were detected by the CzechMoravian Belgian horse (CMB). This breed can therefore be regarded as the most well bred. The greatest value of the index body frame, the index heights in the crisis as well as index of severity were found in the breed SN. On the other hand CMB reached the lowest values in the above-mentioned indices and also in the index of boniness. Norick horses (N) have the most massive skeleton. In the scope of the height index of the sternum there was prevailed CMB at the beginning of rearing, but at the age of year and a half they began reaching a higher value N.

40|$|Babblers {{together}} with the close related Timallidae are not very common inmates of the zoological gardens. In the Czech Republic they are only bred in the zoological gardens in Ohrada, Pilsen and Prague. The breeding in the zoological gardens is not generally very successful. The zoo in Prague with its number of species owns the largest collection of these birds in Europe. In the past the breeders in Prague were the first ones in Europe who managed to raise for example Rufous-fronted Laughingthrush, Sunda Laughingthrush, Barred Laughingthrush or Sumatran Laughingthrush (Black-and-white Laughingthrush). As the first ones in the Czech Republic {{they were able to}} reproduce the critically endagered Blue-crowned Laughingthrush (Courtois's Laughingthrush). The Blue-crowned Laughingthrush is so rare that for several years it was not clear at all if they still live in nature. In the year 2000 they were rediscovered in the number of 240 pieces. The quantity of them in the zoological gardens all over the world does not exceed 100 pieces. The zoo in Chester does a European <b>breeding</b> <b>book</b> of these pieces. Some birds in Prague reproduce repetitively and they prove that the right method of the breeding was found. Hopefully this method would lead to the birth of the securing population in the care of humans. This securing population is very important for the protection of these birds. The attempt of this work is to assess the links between the results of the breeding and their conditions, the comparison of the nesting activities of the two chosen species of babblers, then the summarizing of the expansion and the results of the breeding of the individual species and also the processing of the expansion, the development of the quantity and the problems of the protection of the babblers in nature. The following facts were found out: the breeding of the birds in the exposition or in its environment does not have an essential influence on their nesting activity. However, for the nesting activity it is more important if they are a newly formed couple or a couple paired for a longer time and at the forest babbler it is the female that has an important role in incubation period. However, at the Sumatran Laughingthrush there is a frequent changing in different time intervals. The work also shows that only 5 species out of 12, that showed the nesting activity, are able to build a nest without the help of the keepers. That can be attributed to their closer relational breeding and also to putting the higher number of artificially reared individuals into the breeding...|$|R
50|$|The variety called ‘Madeleine Angevine’ in the UK is more {{properly}} called Madeleine x Angevine 7672. In 1957 Ray Brock at Oxted was sent cuttings of several varieties by Dr Zimmerman from Alzey {{and one of}} them was labelled ‘Sämling seedling 7672’. Just when this crossing was made is not known, although the timing would suggest that it was while Georg Scheu - responsible for varieties such as Huxelrebe, Faberrebe, Kanzler, Regner, Scheurebe, Septimer, Siegerrebe and Würzer - was the Alzey Institute’s Director. By 1960 Brock was able to report that it was: giving large crops which ripen with Riesling Sylvaner MT. Considered to be a promising variety. Not having been given the crossing details of Sämling 7672, Brock wrote to Zimmerman and asked for them. He was informed that it was a ‘freely pollinated seedling of Madeleine Angevine’. When Brock started to sell cuttings of the variety (as he did with all promising varieties) he gave it the name Madeleine x Angevine 7672 and it was under this name that it was known for many years. As it became quite popular, the name on wine labels became shortened to simply ‘Madeleine Angevine’. This was an unfortunate name as another variety already existed under this name.The true Madeleine Angevine (also sometimes called Madeleine d’Angevine), is a female only table-grape variety, a crossing of Précoce de Malingre and Madeleine Royale made by Pierre Vibert at the Moreau-Robert nurseries in Angers in 1857 (some reports say 1859). It is one of the earliest table-grape varieties for open cultivation in France. Having only female flowers and being very early, it has been used by plant breeders in a number of crosses over the years. Morio and Husfeld used it for Forta and Noblessa and it is one grandparent of Reichensteiner. Scheu himself used it to produce Siegerrebe and interestingly, this variety, which at one time was credited with being a Madeleine Angevine x Gewürztraminer crossing, was unmasked by Heinz Scheu - Georg’s son - as also being a freely pollinated Madeleine Angevine seedling. It is conceivable that the variety we now grow in the UK as Madeleine x Angevine 7672 comes from the same crossing programme that produced Siegerrebe. In 1992, I asked Professor Dr Alleweldt, then head of the Geilweilerhof State Institute for Grapevine Breeding, to see if he could discover more about our Mad Angie (as it is often known). He located Georg Scheu’s old <b>breeding</b> <b>books</b> in the Alzey archives and found that ‘Sämling 7672’ was - as Brock was originally told - an ‘open pollinated progeny of Madeleine Angevine’.|$|R

Porter became interested in sports, and concentrated on the emerging sports journalism field. In December 1831, Porter published {{the first issue of}} a new newspaper devoted to covering sports and other recreational activities, which he called The Spirit of the Times. Porter imitated Bell's Life in London, a contemporary English publication covering the same subjects. The first attempt at Spirit of the Times failed quickly, and Porter sold the magazine to C. J. B. Fisher, who merged it into Fisher's publication of the Traveller, and the Spirit was combined with the Traveller as the Traveller and Spirit of the Times. During the brief period that Porter operated the Spirit, he employed Horace Greeley as a typesetter. When Porter sold the Spirit, he then went to work at the New-Yorker, which was edited at the time by Horace Greeley. In January 1835 Porter purchased the Traveller and Spirit of the Times and renamed the newspaper back to Spirit of the Times, returning to editing it. This version of the Spirit managed to survive, although with some initial financial difficulties. Porter focused on selling his paper in the south and west of the United States, and emphasized subjects of use to his readers, such as cattle <b>breeding,</b> farm methods, <b>books</b> of interest, as well as sports. The newspaper was published weekly.|$|R

Barker, R. E. ISBN: 1402018673, 11, 81 - 86 Forage and turf are {{the backbone of}} sustainable agriculture and contribute extensively to the world economy. The fast-paced advancement of cellular and molecular biology provides novel methods to accelerate or complement conventional <b>breeding</b> efforts. This <b>book</b> contains the most comprehensive reviews on the latest development in applications of molecular {{techniques for}} the improvement of forage grasses, forage legumes and turf grasses. Detailed accounts and future opportunities in molecular breeding of forage and turf, from gene discovery to development of improved cultivars, are described in the book. Almost all relevant areas are explored in detail, including tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses; flowering control; plant-symbiont relations; breeding for animal, human and environmental welfare; molecular markers; transgenics; bioinformatics; population genetics; genomics of the model legume M. truncatula; field testing and risk assessment as well as intellectual property rights. This book will be of interest to researchers in both academia and industry who are involved in forage and turf improvement. It will be especially important to breeders, molecular biologists, geneticists, physiologists and agronomists. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This book {{consists}} of three distinct, but closely related, parts. The first is {{an account of the}} origin and distribution of cattle through the tropical and sub-tropical world, citing contemporary evidence from anthropological, archaeological, historical, linguistic, livestock husbandry and genetic studies. It is a first, and therefore controversial, attempt to provide a comprehensive overview as to the origin of the very large number of tropical cattle breeds. In the second part, an attempt is made to classify and describe all major tropical and sub-tropical breeds in Africa, the Americas, Asia and Oceania. The primary purpose of classification is to facilitate conservation of all these breeds and to provide basic information for the selection of those breeds most suitable for inclusion in breeding projects. Requirements for future breeding strategies and policies are discussed in the third part of the book, together with the role that biotechnology could play in future tropical cattle <b>breeding</b> plans. The <b>book</b> will be of interest to those interested in, or involved with, farming, livestock husbandry, veterinary science, anthropology, archaeology and economic history.
