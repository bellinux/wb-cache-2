40|$|Background: Pulmonary {{embolism}} is {{the most}} common preventable cause of death in hospitalised patient. It can readily be prevented by adequate prophylaxis. Inspite of multiple guidelines on risk factor assessment for venous thromboembolism (VTE), utilization of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis remains less than satisfactory. Critically ill patient are at increased risk of developing VTE which leads to significant morbidity and mortality in this population. In western intensive care units utilization of DVT prophylaxis varies from 40 - 90 &#x 0025;. There has not been a systematic study to detect the incidence of DVT prophylaxis in India. Objective: To assess the utilization of Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in Multidisciplinary critical care unit. Design: Prospective Cohort Multi-centre Study.

40|$|Background: Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an {{autoimmune}} {{demyelinating disease}} preferentially targeting the optic nerves and spinal cord. Plasmapheresis (PP) {{is an effective}} adjunct therapy in severe NMO attacks. The recommended minimum plasma volume to be treated per session of PP is equivalent to total plasma volume (TPV) of the patient. Aim: To study the effect of lower plasma volume treated in patients with NMO on clinical efficacy of plasmapheresis in comparison to minimum recommended volume. Methods: This retrospective study was done on acute NMO patients who were managed with PP at our center. Patients who had 5 sessions of PP, spread over 10 days, were included. Clinical outcome was defined <b>as</b> <b>per</b> <b>predefined</b> criteria. Results: 24 patients who underwent PP for acute NMO met our inclusion criteria. Females (age; mean (SD) 33. 7 (11. 2) years) were more common (n = 18). The minimum recommended plasma volume (PV) {{that was supposed to}} be treated per patient during entire acute therapeutic period was 195. 5 (14. 6) mL per kilogram-body-weight (kg-bw). We treated lower plasma volume (mean (SD) 112. 7 (17. 0) mL per kg-bw); the difference was significant (P 0. 05). Significant clinical improvement was observed in 79 % of patients (n = 19) after 6 months. There were no significant differences in volume of plasma treated, between patients who had moderate and marked improvement; also, who did, and did not have significant clinical improvement (P > 0. 05; for both).

Comparison of these methods, especially the chronic kidney disease-epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation with gold standard method of assessment of GFR by plasma clearance of Tc- 99 mDTPA is not well-studied in Indian population. We conducted this study to compare GFR estimation by gamma camera-based Gates protocol and serum creatinine-based predicting equations with GFR measured by plasma clearance of Tc- 99 mDTPA. One hundred and five patients (65 male and 40 female) underwent Tc- 99 m DTPA renal scan followed by withdrawal of venous blood samples at 2, 3, and 4 h <b>as</b> <b>per</b> <b>predefined</b> protocol. Gates method GFR (GFRs) was assessed using standard protocol. GFR by plasma sampling (GFRp) was calculated by slope-intercept method with provision for corrections. Estimated GFR was calculated by Cockroft-Gault formula, four variable modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation, and CKD-EPI equation (GFRCG, GFRMDRD, GFRCKD-EPI, respectively). GFR measured by gold standard method (GFRp) was compared with that estimated by other methods by calculating correlation coefficient, bias, precision, and accuracy. GFR estimated by all three estimating equations correlated better than GFRs with GFRp. For estimating GFRp, GFRCKD-EPI had highest correlation with GFRp with least bias and highest precision. Gamma camera-based Gates protocol was the least precise and least accurate method for estimating GFRp.

40|$|BACKGROUND One {{aspect of}} a multidimensional {{approach}} to understanding asthma as a complex dynamic disease is to study how lung function varies with time. Variability measures of lung function {{have been shown to}} predict response to beta(2) -agonist treatment. An investigation was conducted to determine whether mean, coefficient of variation (CV) or autocorrelation, a measure of short-term memory, of peak expiratory flow (PEF) could predict loss of asthma control following withdrawal of regular inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment, using data from a previous study. METHODS 87 adult patients with mild to moderate asthma who had been taking ICS at a constant dose for at least 6 months were monitored for 2 - 4 weeks. ICS was then withdrawn and monitoring continued until loss of control occurred <b>as</b> <b>per</b> <b>predefined</b> criteria. Twice-daily PEF was recorded during monitoring. Associations between loss of control and mean, CV and autocorrelation of morning PEF within 2 weeks pre- and post-ICS withdrawal were assessed using Cox regression analysis. Predictive utility was assessed using receiver operator characteristics. RESULTS 53 out of 87 patients had sufficient PEF data over the required analysis period. The mean (389 vs 370 l/min, p< 0. 0001) and CV (4. 5 % vs 5. 6 %, p= 0. 007) but not autocorrelation of PEF changed significantly from prewithdrawal to postwithdrawal in subjects who subsequently lost control, and were unaltered in those who did not. These changes were related to time to loss of control. CV was the most consistent predictor, with similar sensitivity and sensitivity to exhaled nitric oxide. CONCLUSION A simple, easy to obtain variability measure of daily lung function such as the CV may predict loss of asthma control within the first 2 weeks of ICS withdrawal...|$|R

Materials and Methods : Of the 87 patients, 23 patients qualified and were treated with SRS <b>as</b> <b>per</b> <b>predefined</b> protocol according to AVM size, location, neurological status, prior bleeding, and the AVM score. All had Spletzer-Martin grade II/III and AVM scores &# 60; 2. 5. Patients underwent SRS using micromultileaf collimators delivering multiple noncoplanar fixed fields. Doses were prescribed using the Flickinger model. Patients were followed up with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and digitally subtracted angiography (DSA). Results : The mean nidus volume was 3. 65 cc. The mean prescribed maximum dose was 22 Gy and the marginal dose was 19. 24 Gy; 12 Gy normal brain volume was 8. 39 cc and 12 Gy marginal volume was 5. 03 cc. Mean dose to brain stem, pituitary hypothalamic axis, and optic chiasm was 2. 5, 0. 72, and 0. 49 Gy, respectively. At a median follow-up of 22 months (range 1. 5 - 71. 2 months), 7 of 10 patients presenting with a neurological deficit showed significant improvement.

Settings and Design: Six hundred sixty nine participants matching the inclusion criteria were recruited from 10 tribal villages of Melghat region, India. Subjects and Methods: Complete information related to various risk factors and test outcome was obtained on 398 participants, which was analyzed <b>as</b> <b>per</b> <b>predefined</b> conceptual framework. Factors were classified based on their relevance either at individual or household level, and subsequently based on the possibility of intervention. Data were partitioned into concordant and discordant sets depending on test agreement. Results: In concordant set, the two tests revealed that LTBI was significantly associated with smoking (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2. 64 [95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 03 - 6. 79]), tobacco usage (aOR: 2. 74 [95 % CI: 1. 50 - 4. 99]), and malnourishment (aOR: 1. 97 [95 % CI: 1. 12 - 3. 48]) after basic adjustment. Inclusion of latent variable SES and LC in the model has mediating effect on the association of above factors with LTBI. Further, the association of SES and LC with LTBI in concordant set was unaltered in presence of other cofactors. From discordant set, results of QFT-G corroborated with that of concordant set.

Many major recognized CRF exist. Out of these factorsmany of themare indirect factor of bone quality. TBS predicts fracture independently of BMD as demonstrated from previous studies. The {{aim of the}} study is to verify if TBS can be considered as a major CRF of osteoporotic fracture. Existing validated datasets of Caucasian women were analyzed. These datasets stem from different studies performed by the authors of this report or provided to our group. However, the level of evidence of these studies will vary. Thus, the different datasets were weighted differently according to their design. This meta-like analysis involves more than 32000 women (≥ 50 years) with 2000 osteoporotic fractures from two prospective studies (OFELY&MANITOBA) and 7 crosssectional studies. Weighted relative risk (RR) for TBS was expressed for each decrease of one standard <b>deviation</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>per</b> tertile difference (TBS= 1. 300 and 1. 200) and compared with those obtained for the major CRF included in FRAX®.

40|$|AbstractGateways {{implementing}} IPSec {{protocol suite}} {{are used to}} provide secure communication between different client machines over public infrastructure. However the exploitation of covert storage channel in the IPSec protocol may defeat the very purpose of protecting leakage of information from the client machine. This threat gets more aggravated {{as some of the}} channels might be exploited from the client machine even without compromising the security of the IPSec gateways. The possibility of information leakage by compromising only the client machine, either in form of a colluding insider or due to the presence of some malware at the client machine, poses a serious threat to any organization dealing with sensitive information and a resourceful adversary. The existing approaches to mitigate the threats against storage covert channels severely restrict the usability of many QoS aware applications by reducing the allowance of relevant header fields to minimum. This work overcomes the same by creating separate partitions based on application specific QoS requirements. Subsequent IPSec processing involves extension of the scope of security services <b>as</b> <b>per</b> the <b>predefined</b> QoS requirements. This is achieved by appropriate allowance of QoS related header fields using a comprehensive treatment of the storage and timing covert channels. When compared with existing approaches, the proposed approach provides better usability in QoS demanding contexts while maintaining equivalent strength of protection against storage covert channels and providing equivalent performance. The paper also outlines an implementation strategy of the same on Linux kernel IPSec stack...|$|R
40|$|Intraoperative neurophysiologic {{monitoring}} is {{an integral}} part of spinal surgeries and involves the recording of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP). However, clinical application of IONM still requires anywhere between 200 to 2000 trials to obtain an SSEP signal, which is excessive and introduces a significant delay during surgery to detect a possible neurological damage. The aim of this study is to develop a means to obtain the SSEP using a much less, twelve number of recordings. The preliminary step involved was to distinguish the SSEP with the ongoing brain activity. We first establish that the brain activity is indeed quasi-stationary whereas an SSEP is expected to be identical every time a trial is recorded. An algorithm was developed using Chebychev time windowing for preconditioning of SSEP trials to retain the morphological characteristics of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP). This preconditioning was followed by the application of a principal component analysis (PCA) -based algorithm utilizing quasi-stationarity of EEG on 12 preconditioned trials. A unique Walsh transform operation was then used to identify the position of the SSEP event. An alarm is raised when there is a 10 % time in latency deviation and/or 50 % peak-to-peak amplitude <b>deviation,</b> <b>as</b> <b>per</b> the clinical requirements. The algorithm shows consistency in the results in monitoring SSEP in up to 6 -hour surgical procedures even under this significantly reduced number of trials. In this study, the analysis was performed on the data recorded in 29 patients undergoing surgery during which the posterior tibial nerve was stimulated and SSEP response was recorded from scalp. This method is shown empirically to be more clinically viable than present day approaches. In all 29 cases, the algorithm takes 4 sec to extract an SSEP signal, as compared to conventional methods, which take several minutes. The monitoring process using the algorithm was successful and proved conclusive under the clinical constraints throughout the different surgical procedures with an accuracy of 91. 5 %. Higher accuracy and faster execution time, observed in the present study, in determining the SSEP signals provide a much improved and effective neurophysiological monitoring process. ...|$|R
