40|$|Many migratory herbivores seem {{to follow}} the flush of plant growth during {{migration}} in order to acquire the most nutrient-rich plants. This has also been hypothesized for arctic-breeding geese, but so far no test of this so-called green wave hypothesis has been performed at the individual level. During four years, a total of 30 greater white-fronted geese Anser albifrons albifrons was tracked using GPS transmitters, of which 13 yielded complete spring migration tracks. From those birds we defined stopover sites and related the date of arrival at each of these stopovers to temperature sum (growing degree days, GDD), snow cover, accumulated photoperiod and latitude. We found that geese arrived at spring stopovers close to the peak in GDD jerk; the ‘jerk’ is the third derivative, or {{the rate of change}} in acceleration, and GDD jerk maxima therefore represent the highest acceleration of daily temperature per site. <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> melt also correlated well with the observed arrival of the geese. Factors not closely related to onset of spring, i. e. accumulated photoperiod and latitude, yielded poorer fits. A comparison with published data revealed that the GDD jerk occurs 1 – 2 weeks earlier than the onset of spring derived from NDVI, and probably represents the very start of spring growth.

40|$|Abstract. Climatic {{changes at}} the Earth’s surface {{propagate}} slowly downward {{into the ground and}} modify the ambient ground thermal regime. However, causes of soil temperature changes in the upper few meters are not well documented. One major obstacle to understanding the linkage between the soil thermal regime and climatic change is the lack of long-term observations of soil temperatures and related climatic variables. Such measurements were made throughout the former Soviet Union with some records beginning {{at the end of the}} 19 th century. In this paper, we use records from Irkutsk, Russia, to demonstrate how the soil temperature responded to climatic changes over the last century. Both air temperature and precipitation at Irkutsk increased from the late 1890 s to the 1990 s. Changes in air temperature mainly occurred in winter, while changes in precipitation happened mainly during summer. There was an anti-correlation between mean annual air temperature and annual total precipitation, i. e., more (less) precipitation during cold (warm) years. There were no significant trends of changes in the first <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> on the ground in autumn, but snow steadily disappeared earlier in spring, resulting in a reduction of the snow cover duration. A grass-covered soil experiences seasonal freezing for more than nine months each year and the long-term average maximum depth of seasonally frozen soils was about 177 cm with a range from 91 cm to 260 cm.

40|$|AbstractSnow cover {{pattern and}} {{persistence}} {{have important implications}} for planetary energy balance, climate sensitivity to forcings, and vegetation structure, function, and composition. Variability in snow cover within mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest, USA is attributable to a combination of anthropogenic climate change and climate oscillations. However, snow covered areas can be heterogeneous and patchy, requiring more detailed mapping of snow trends to understand their potential influences on montane forests. We used standard daily MODIS snow products (MOD 10 A 1. 5) to investigate the 15 -year record (2000 – 2014) of snow cover in the predominant forest ecotone of the Oregon Western Cascades. We modeled the ecotone using field data from the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, and only considered forested MODIS Terra pixels located within the mapped ecotone of a five-county region. Three snow cover metrics were developed using both binary and fractional snow cover data: mean ecotone snow cover percent, number of snow covered days during the melt season, and <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> disappearance. Snow cover and depletion dates exhibited large interannual variability and no significant linear trends. This variability is likely influenced by the preceding wintertime states of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which tend to covary. We improve and generalize existing methods for power analysis of trend estimation and quantify the number of uninterrupted observations of the snow metrics that would be needed to distinguish trends of different magnitudes from noise variance, taking possible autocorrelation into account. Sensitivity analyses of the results to some of our heuristic choices are conducted, and challenges associated with optical remote sensing of snow in a dense montane forest are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Driving role of {{snow cover}} on soil {{moisture}} and drought development {{during the growing}} season in the Czech RepublicDOI: 10. 1002 /joc. 4588 URL: [URL] Filiació URV: SIThis study presents a detailed analysis on the role of snow cover during the cold season (October–March) on soil moisture deficit and drought development {{during the growing season}} (April–September) in the lowland and highland sites in the Czech Republic. Besides daily, weekly and seasonal series of basic snow-cover characteristics [the first day and the last <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> cover, the number of days with snow cover (DSC), snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) ] and soil water content measurements, six drought indices have been used in this study to quantify drought. Accumulations of years with significantly below average DSC/SWE were recorded in the early 1960 s, mid- 1980 s, late 1990 s and most of the 2000 s. The trend towards an earlier end date of snow cover is found in both lowland and highland sites. However, the most significant shift in the dates of early end of snow cover has been identified to occur mostly in the hilly areas while in the lowland areas, these changes are not that evident. Liquid precipitation more than solid precipitation (snowfall) during the cold season lead to weakening correlation between SWE/DSC and the subsequent early summer (April–May–June, AMJ) soil moisture. Snow-cover characteristics can significantly influence soil water saturation during {{the first part of the}} growing season, while seasonal amount of SWE can explain up to 45 % of soil moisture variability during AMJ season. More than 52 % of dry AMJ followed after cold seasons with poor snow, and 42 % of wet AMJ season followed after cold seasons with abundant snow. The strength of correlation between drought indices and soil moisture anomalies is higher in later summer. The negative anomalous snow characteristics in conjunction with winter and AMJ drought amplify lingering impact on the d...|$|E
40|$|Snow is {{a common}} {{overlying}} surface during winter-time and the redistribution of snow by wind {{is a very important}} concept for any hydrological research project located within the cryosphere. Wind redistributes snow by eroding it from areas of high wind speed, such as ridge tops and windward slopes, and deposits it in areas of lower wind speeds, such as the lees of ridge tops, vegetation stands, and topographic depressions. The accurate modelling of blowing snow processes such as erosion, deposition, and sublimation have proven to be rather problematic. The largest issue that many modellers must deal with is the accurate collection of solid precipitation throughout the winter season. Without this, incorrect energy and mass balances can occur. This thesis makes use of a new method of acquiring solid precipitation values {{through the use of a}}n SR 50 a ultrasonic snow depth sensor and then incorporates it into a version of the Cold Regions Hydrological Model (CRHM) which includes the Prairie Blowing Snow Model (PBSM) and the Minimal Snowmelt Model (MSM) modules. The model is used to simulate seasonal snow depth over an agricultural field in southern Ontario, Canada and is driven with half-hourly locally acquired meteorological data for 83 days during the 2008 - 2009 winter season. Semi-automated snow surveys are conducted throughout the winter season and the collected in situ snow depth values are compared to the simulated snow depth values at multiple scales. Two modelling approaches are taken to temporally and spatially test model performance. A lumped approach tests the model‟s ability to simulate snow depth from a small point scale and from a larger field scale. A distributed approach separates the entire field site into three hydrological response units (HRUs) and tests the model‟s ability to spatially discretize at the field scale. HRUs are differentiated by varying vegetation heights throughout the field site. Temporal analysis compares the simulated results to each <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> survey and for the entire field season. Model performance is statistically analyzed through the use of a Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS), and Model Bias (MB). Both the lumped and distributed modelling approaches fail to simulate the early on-set of snow but once the snow-holding capacities are reached within the field site the model does well to simulate the average snow depth during the latter few days of snow survey as well as throughout the entire field season. Several model limitations are present which prevent the model from incorporating the scaling effects of topography, vegetation, and man-made objects as well as the effects from certain energy fluxes. These limitations are discussed further...|$|E

40|$|Before {{operational}} use or {{for decision}} making, models must be validated, {{and the degree}} of trust in model outputs should be quantified. Often, model validation is performed at single locations {{due to the lack of}} spatially-distributed data. Since the analysis of parametric model uncertainties can be performed independently of observations, it is a suitable method to test the influence of environmental variability on model evaluation. In this study, the sensitivities and uncertainty of a physically-based mountain permafrost model are quantified within an artificial topography consisting of different elevations and exposures combined with six ground types characterized by their hydraulic properties. The analyses performed for all combinations of topographic factors and ground types allowed to quantify the variability of model sensitivity and uncertainty within mountain regions. We found that modeled snow duration considerably influences the mean annual ground temperature (MAGT). The melt-out <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> (MD) is determined by processes determining snow accumulation and melting. Parameters such as the temperature and precipitation lapse rate and the snow correction factor have therefore a great impact on modeled MAGT. Ground albedo changes MAGT from 0. 5 to 4 °C in dependence of the elevation, the aspect and the ground type. South-exposed inclined locations are more sensitive to changes in ground albedo than north-exposed slopes since they receive more solar radiation. The sensitivity to ground albedo increases with decreasing elevation due to shorter snow cover. Snow albedo and other parameters determining the amount of reflected solar radiation are important, changing MAGT at different depths by more than 1 °C. Parameters influencing the turbulent fluxes as the roughness length or the dew temperature are more sensitive at low elevation sites due to higher air temperatures and decreased solar radiation. Modeling the individual terms of the energy balance correctly is hence crucial in any physically-based permafrost model, and a separate evaluation of the energy fluxes could substantially improve the results of permafrost models. The sensitivity in the hydraulic properties change considerably for different ground types: rock or clay for instance are not sensitive while gravel or peat, accurate measurements of the hydraulic properties could significantly improve modeled ground temperatures. Further, the discretization of ground, snow and time have an impact on modeled MAGT that cannot be neglected (more than 1 °C for several discretization parameters). We show that the temporal resolution should be at least one hour to ensure errors less than 0. 2 °C in modeled MAGT, and the uppermost ground layer should at most be 20 mm thick. Within the topographic setting, the total parametric output uncertainties expressed as the standard deviation of the Monte Carlo model simulations range from 0. 1 to 0. 5 °C for clay, silt and rock, and from 0. 1 to 0. 8 °C for peat, sand and gravel. These uncertainties are comparable to the variability of ground surface temperatures measured within 10 m × 10 m grids in Switzerland. The increased uncertainties for sand, peat and gravel is largely due to the high hydraulic conductivity...|$|E
