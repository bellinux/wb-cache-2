Should anyone die at sea, his property becomes forfeit to the government...The ship's pilots are acquainted with the configuration of the coasts; at night they steer by the stars, and in the day-time by the sun. In dark weather they look at the south-pointing needle (i.e. the magnetic compass). They also use a line a hundred feet long with a hook at the end which they let down to take samples of mud from the sea-bottom; by its (appearance and) smell they can determine their whereabouts.|$|E

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of the population is Teda, one of the two ethnicities of the Toubou people. However, some clans are Daza, the other Toubou ethnicity, who left their traditional homes in the lowlands to the south and moved north to the Tibesti. The Toubou, in general, are semi-nomadic and live primarily in northern Chad, but also in southern Libya and eastern Niger. The Toubou language has two main dialects, Tedaga, spoken by the Teda, and Dazaga, spoken by the Daza. Despite their cultural proximity, the two Toubou groups do not identify as a single ethnic group. The Toubou elect a chief, the Derdé, from the Tomagra clan, although never from the same family consecutively. The Derdé resides in Zouar and aims to impose religious and judicial authority over the Tibesti population; however, efforts toward executive cooperation and war alliances are usually destined for failure. The descendants of previous Derdé retain authority which transfers from father to son. These appointed Maïna govern portions of the Toubou territories. Individual clans rarely <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> thousand members and are quite dispersed throughout the Tibesti.|$|E

500|$|Skeptics such as James Randi {{suggest that}} his {{reputation}} as a prophet is largely manufactured by modern-day supporters who fit his words to events that have either already occurred or are so imminent as to be inevitable, a process sometimes known as [...] "retroactive clairvoyance" [...] (postdiction). Thus, no Nostradamus quatrain is known to have been interpreted as predicting a specific event before it occurred, other than in vague, general terms that could equally apply to any number of other events. [...] This even applies to quatrains that contain specific dates, such as III.77, which predicts [...] "in 1727, in October, the king of Persia [...] captured by those of Egypt"—a prophecy that has, as ever, been interpreted retrospectively in the light of later events, in this case as though it presaged the known peace treaty between the Ottoman Empire and Persia of that year. Similarly, Nostradamus's notorious '1999' prophecy at X.72 (see Nostradamus in popular culture) describes no event that commentators have succeeded in identifying either before or since, other than by dint of twisting the words to fit whichever of the many contradictory happenings they are keen to claim as 'hits'. Moreover, no quatrain suggests, as is often claimed by books and films on the alleged Mayan Prophecy, that the world would end in December 2012. [...] In his preface to the Prophecies, Nostradamus himself stated that his prophecies extend 'from now to the year 3797'—an extraordinary date which, given that the preface was written in 1555, may <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> {{little to do with the}} fact that 2242 (3797−1555) had recently been proposed by his major astrological source Richard Roussat as a possible date for the end of the world.|$|E
500|$|The clan's {{social life}} {{revolves}} around a communal den. While some clans may use particular den sites for years, others may use several different dens {{within a year}} or several den sites simultaneously. Spotted hyena dens can <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> dozen entrances, and are mostly located on flat ground. The tunnels are usually oval in section, being wider than they are high, and narrow down from an entrance width of ½–1 metre (1.6–7.7ft) to as small as [...] In the rocky areas of East Africa and Congo, spotted hyenas use caves as dens, while those in the Serengeti use kopjes as resting areas in daylight hours. Dens have large bare patches around their entrances, where hyenas move or lie down on. Because of their size, adult hyenas are incapable of using the full extent of their burrows, as most tunnels are dug by cubs or smaller animals. The structure of the den, consisting of small underground channels, is likely an effective anti-predator device which protects cubs from predation during the absence of the mother. Spotted hyenas rarely dig their own dens, having been observed for the most part to use the abandoned burrows of warthogs, springhares and jackals. Faeces are usually deposited [...] away from the den, though they urinate wherever they happen to be. Dens are used mostly by several females at once, and {{it is not uncommon to}} see up to 20 cubs at a single site. The general form of a spotted hyena den is tunnel-shaped, with a spacious end chamber used for sleeping or breeding. This chamber measures up to [...] in width, the height being rather less. Females generally give birth at the communal den or a private birth den. The latter is primarily used by low status females in order to maintain continual access to their cubs, as well as ensure that they become acquainted with their cubs before transferral to the communal den.|$|E
