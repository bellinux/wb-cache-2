5|$|Meyerbeer's costly operas, {{requiring}} grand casts {{of leading}} singers, were gradually {{dropped from the}} repertoire in the early 20th century. They were banned in Germany from 1933, and subsequently in subject countries, by the Nazi regime because the composer was Jewish, {{and this was a}} major <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> further disappearance from the repertory.|$|E
5|$|Around 1450 BC, Greece {{was divided}} {{into a series of}} warrior kingdoms, the most {{important}} being centered in Mycenae, Tiryns, Pylos and Thebes. Before the end of the same century, this militaristic civilization replaced the former priestess-dominated civilization of Minoan Cretans in the Aegean. Thus, the Mycenaeans began to build up their maritime power in the Aegean Sea, expanding towards the Aegean Islands and Anatolian coast. The warlike nature of the Mycenaeans was probably a decisive <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> diplomatic relations towards the other Late Bronze Age powers. Mycenaean warriors were also hired as mercenaries in foreign armies, such as in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer edge}} of the vulcanoid zone is {{approximately}} 0.21AU from the Sun. More distant objects are unstable due to the gravitational influence of Mercury and would be perturbed into Mercury-crossing orbits on timescales of the order of 100 million years. The inner edge is not sharply defined: objects closer than 0.06AU are highly susceptible to Poynting–Robertson drag and the Yarkovsky effect, and even out to 0.09AU vulcanoids would have temperatures of 1,000K or more, which is hot enough for evaporation of rocks to be the limiting <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lifetime.|$|E

5|$|Three {{species of}} Malagasy {{hippopotamus}} became extinct during the Holocene on Madagascar, {{one of them}} within the past 1,000 years. The Malagasy hippos were smaller than the modern hippopotamus, likely {{through the process of}} insular dwarfism. Fossil evidence indicates many Malagasy hippos were hunted by humans, a likely <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> eventual extinction. Isolated members of Malagasy hippopotamus may have survived in remote pockets; in 1976, villagers described a living animal called the kilopilopitsofy, which may have been a Malagasy hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the Paleozoic, around 400 Mya, the brachiopods were among the most {{abundant}} filter feeders in the ocean, and over 12,000 fossil species are recognized. By the PermianTriassic extinction event 250 Mya, bivalves were undergoing a huge radiation of diversity. The bivalves were hard hit by this event, but re-established themselves and thrived during the Triassic period that followed. In contrast, the brachiopods lost 95% of their species diversity. The ability of some bivalves to burrow and thus avoid predators may have been a major <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> success. Other new adaptations within various families allowed species to occupy previously unused evolutionary niches. These included increasing relative buoyancy in soft sediments by developing spines on the shell, gaining the ability to swim, and in a few cases, adopting predatory habits.|$|E
5|$|Pat Secor, Hoppus' boss at {{music store}} The Wherehouse, was {{attempting}} {{to start his own}} record label, named Filter Records. Secor pulled money from his savings and helped finance and produce the demo recording. Buddha was recorded live at local Santee studio Doubletime, compiling a collection that represented nearly all of the songs the band had written up to that point. Hoppus and friends Cam Jones and Kerry Key created the cassette artwork, and the original cassette packaging was compiled by the band and Hoppus' family. Locally distributed to several San Diego record stores and available for purchase at early concerts, Buddha helped the trio cement an audience and was a deciding <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> signing to local label Cargo in 1993.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{founding}} of the University of Alberta was the centrepiece of Rutherford's educational policy, his activity as Minister of Education extended well beyond it. In the first year of Alberta's existence, 140 new schools were established, and a normal school was set up in Calgary to train teachers. Rutherford put great emphasis on the creation of English-language schools in the large portions of the province occupied primarily by central- and eastern-European immigrants. The immigrants themselves were often unable to speak English, and the provision of these schools for their children was a major <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> rapid assimilation into Albertan society. They were also in lieu of separate religious schools for groups such as Mennonites; while the continued existence of Roman Catholic separate schools was mandated by the terms of Alberta's admission into Confederation, the government's policy was otherwise to encourage a unified and secular public school system. Rutherford also introduced free school texts in the province, though he was criticized for commissioning the texts from a Toronto publisher (which printed them in New York) rather than locally.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte {{believed}} that, {{by establishing}} a permanent presence in Egypt (nominally part of the neutral Ottoman Empire), the French would obtain a staging point for future operations against British India, possibly {{in conjunction with the}} Tipu Sultan of Seringapatam, that might successfully drive the British out of the war. The campaign would sever the chain of communication that connected Britain with India, {{an essential part of the}} British Empire whose trade generated the wealth that Britain required to prosecute the war successfully. The French Directory agreed with Bonaparte's plans, although a major <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> decision was a desire to see the politically ambitious Bonaparte and the fiercely loyal veterans of his Italian campaigns travel as far from France as possible. During the spring of 1798, Bonaparte assembled more than 35,000 soldiers in Mediterranean France and Italy and developed a powerful fleet at Toulon. He also formed the Commission des Sciences et des Arts, a body of scientists and engineers intended to establish a French colony in Egypt. Napoleon kept the destination of the expedition top secret—most of the army's officers did not know of its target, and Bonaparte did not publicly reveal his goal until the first stage of the expedition was complete.|$|E
5|$|Several units lost crucially needed {{supply lines}} {{in the middle of}} their offensives, {{particularly}} when crossing the Naktong River which had few stable bridges remaining. The NK 3rd Division stopped receiving food and ammunition supply as it pushed on Taegu in mid-August, forcing one of its regiments to withdraw from the captured Triangulation Hill. At Naktong Bulge, the NK 4th Division was able to establish a raft system for moving supplies across the river, but it still suffered serious food, ammunition, weapon, and equipment shortages after its August 5 crossing. It was also eventually turned back due to supply problems. The situation was most dire for units in the east, where rugged and mountainous terrain already posed a logistical challenge. The NK 5th Division and NK 12th Division attacking P'ohang-dong stopped receiving all food and ammunition supply between August 12 and August 20, a key <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> defeat there. In some instances, desperate North Korean units forced South Korean populations to carry their supplies for them. North Korean units had advanced too far too quickly, and their logistical system, stretched beyond its limit, collapsed at a key point in the war. Morale remained high for many units despite the lack of supplies. North Korean units instead turned to foraging for what they could find in the countryside or raiding UN supplies. Small guerrilla units, such as the NK 766th Infantry Regiment, could do this effectively.|$|E

5|$|Some of his {{selections}} as captain {{were widely}} debated. Following {{incidents in the}} Caribbean, Trueman did not play for England again under Hutton's captaincy, although he was still regarded as an England prospect. Jim Laker was also omitted from the team, possibly because Hutton doubted Laker's commitment. Both Jim McConnon, Laker's replacement, and Vic Wilson were controversial choices for the 1954–55 Australian tour, whose selections Trevor Bailey attributed to Hutton; neither played a substantial role on the tour. A poor communicator, Hutton distanced himself from his team when a stronger lead was required. Trueman and Bailey thought Hutton {{found it hard to}} talk to his players: amateur critics considered this an inevitable consequence of a professional leading other professionals. On the other hand, Hutton {{played a key role in}} the development of fast bowlers Trueman, Tyson and Brian Statham. Tyson and Statham later acknowledged his advice and encouragement as <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> subsequent success. Cowdrey also acknowledged Hutton's advice and assistance when the former began his career. Furthermore, on the 1954–55 tour of Australia, Hutton took a close interest in him and was a particular comfort when Cowdrey's father died during the tour.|$|E
