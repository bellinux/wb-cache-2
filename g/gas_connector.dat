50|$|The JICA study, {{completed}} in 1976, {{concluded that the}} Jamuna project would cost $683 million with an {{economic rate of return}} (ERR) of only 2.6%. Considering that the project was not technically and economically viable, the government abandoned it. The government revived it in 1982 and commissioned a new study to determine the feasibility of transferring natural gas to western parts of the country across the Jamuna. The study concluded that an independent <b>gas</b> <b>connector</b> was not economically viable. However, the consultants made an assessment of the engineering feasibility and cost of a combined road-cum-gas transmission bridge, which introduced the concept of a multipurpose bridge. It was estimated that a 12 km bridge with three road lanes would cost $420 million. Upon consideration of the report, the cabinet made a decision to take immediate steps in pursuit of the project.|$|E

50|$|For the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, NASA {{decided to}} use the A7LB CMP {{pressure}} suit assembly worn on the J-missions with a few changes to save cost and weight since an EVA was not planned during the mission. The changes included a simplified cover layer which was cheaper, lighter and more durable as well as the removal of the pressure relief valve and unused <b>gas</b> <b>connectors.</b> No EVA visor assemblies or EVA gloves were carried on the mission.|$|R
50|$|The Command Module pilot (CMP) had a TSLA {{similar to}} the {{commander}} and lunar module pilot, but with unnecessary hardware deleted since the CMP would not be performing any extravehicular activities. For example, the CMP's TSLA had only one set of <b>gas</b> <b>connectors</b> instead of two, and had no water cooling connector. Also deleted was the pressure relief valve in the sleeve of the suit and the tether mounting attachments which {{were used in the}} lunar module. The TSLA for the CMP also deleted an arm bearing that allowed the arm to rotate above the elbow.|$|R

40|$|The Z- 2 Prototype Planetary Extravehicular Space Suit Assembly is a {{continuation}} of NASA's Z series of spacesuits. The Z- 2 is another step in NASA's technology development roadmap leading to human exploration of the Martian surface. The suit was designed for maximum mobility at 8. 3 psid, reduced mass, and to have high fidelity life support interfaces. As Z- 2 will be man-tested at full vacuum in NASA JSC's Chamber B, it was manufactured as Class II, making it the most flight-like planetary walking suit produced to date. The Z- 2 suit architecture is an evolution of previous EVA suits, namely the ISS EMU, Mark III, Rear Entry I-Suit and Z- 1 spacesuits. The suit is a hybrid hard and soft multi-bearing, rear entry spacesuit. The hard upper torso (HUT) is an all-composite structure and includes a 2 -bearing rolling convolute shoulder with Vernier sizing mechanism, removable suit port interface plate (SIP), elliptical hemispherical helmet and self-don/doff shoulder harness. The hatch is a hybrid aluminum and composite construction with Apollo style <b>gas</b> <b>connectors,</b> custom water pass-thru, removable hatch cage and interfaces to primary and auxiliary life support feed water bags. The suit includes Z- 1 style lower arms with cam brackets for Vernier sizing and government furnished equipment (GFE) Phase VI gloves. The lower torso includes a telescopic waist sizing system, waist bearing, rolling convolute waist joint, hard brief, 2 bearing soft hip thigh, Z- 1 style legs with ISS EMU style cam brackets for sizing, and conformal walking boots with ankle bearings. The Z- 2 Requirements Verification Plan includes the verification of more than 200 individual requirements. The verification methods include test, analysis, inspection, demonstration or a combination of methods. Examples of unmanned requirements include suit leakage, proof pressure testing, operational life, mass, isometric man-loads, sizing adjustment ranges, internal and external interfaces such as in-suit drink bag, partial pressure relief valve, purge valve, donning stand and ISS Body Restraint Tether (BRT). Examples of manned requirements include verification of anthropometric range, suit self-don/doff, secondary suit exit method, donning stand self-ingress/egress and manned mobility covering eight functional tasks. The eight functional tasks include kneeling with object pick-up, standing toe touch, cross-body reach, walking, reach to the SIP and helmet visor. This paper will provide an overview of the Z- 2 design. Z- 2 requirements verification testing was performed with NASA at the ILC Houston test facility. This paper will also discuss pre-delivery manned and unmanned test results as well as analysis performed in support of requirements verification...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{resolve the}} {{problems}} of short working life and narrow operating voltage range of the spark gap with one-offin gas filling structure, a spark gap with repeatable gas filling structure was designed. The spark gap was composed of three electrodes and two gaps as well as gas filling devices. Electrodes structures adopted the form of field aberration three-electrode gas spark switch forming two discharge gaps between three electrodes of anode, cathode and triggering electrode. Gas filling devices were composed of fast <b>connector,</b> <b>gas</b> pipe, barometer and air valve, by which the gaps could be repeatedly charged and deflated from a hole {{at the center of}} anode. Working life is lengthened by exchanging gas, and operating voltage range is widened by changing gas pressure in a certain range. The spark gap was manufactured and applied successfully in a TEA CO 2 laser with pulse energy 170 J. The results prove the designs feasible...|$|R
40|$|The Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) {{are a part}} of the muon {{spectrometer}} for the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at Large Hadron Collider (LHC). More than 3000 m^ 2 of RPC {{system was}} successfully operated with a closed loop gas system in the first three-running-years of the LHC. Annual campaigns were done during 2011 and 2012 to measure the gas leak rates of the RPCs and the results were compared to the flow-cell readout data. The total leak rate on the barrel increased between 2011 and 2012 while the total rate on the endcaps was negligible during the same period. Consequently, the CMS gas consumption increased, but the gas leaks could not be repaired during the whole period of the data taking at the LHC that lasted more than two years. Here, we present the results of the extensive tests for the first long shutdown period of LHC, including the leak detection in the chambers (internal leak) or <b>gas</b> pipes and <b>connectors</b> (external leak), details on the new leak measurement, and the status of a leak repair...|$|R
5|$|More recently, {{manifolds}} {{have become}} available which connect the cylinders on the cylinder {{side of the}} valve, leaving the outlet connection of the cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator. This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised, {{as there is no}} valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder. This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder, and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders. These manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the manifold, which allows the contents of the cylinders to be isolated from each other. This allows the contents of one cylinder to be isolated and secured for the diver if a leak at the cylinder neck thread, manifold connection, or burst disk on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon manifold system is a connection which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders, and has a single valve to release <b>gas</b> to a <b>connector</b> for a regulator. These manifolds can include a reserve valve, either in the main valve or at one cylinder. This system is mainly of historical interest.|$|R
40|$|Background: If {{at the end}} of anaesthesia, {{the gases}} on the {{anaesthetic}} machine are not turned off, they continue to flow through the breathing circuit and may dry out the carbon dioxide absorbent in the absorber. At the beginning of the next anaesthetic procedure, the desiccated absorbent decomposes the volatile anaesthetic, resulting in the formation of toxic gas mixtures, which are dangerous for the patient. In such circumstances, the measured level of the volatile anaesthesic in the breathing circuit differs from the selected value. In the paper, we analyse potentially dangerous possible directions of continuous flow of fresh gas mixture in different anaesthetic breathing circuits. 				Methods: In {{the first part of the}} study, we simulated the continuous flow of gases in a Sulla anaesthesia machine using an experimental method in a simulation setting. In the second part, we analysed whether a retrograde flow through the absorber was possible in a convential anaesthetic breathing circuit and in the Fabius GS, Cato, Julian and Primus circuits with the Y-piece connector open or closed. Information on users’ requests for maintenance services due to discrepancies between the desired and measured levels of the volatile anaesthetic in the breathing circuit were obtained from the manufacturer’s local servicing agent. 				Results: In a Dräger ISO 8 circle system (Sulla anaesthetic machine) with a standard <b>gas</b> supply <b>connector,</b> a retrograde flow is not possible. If the Y-piece connector is left open, the gases are vented to the outside via the absorber and the inspiratory tube. If the Y-piece connector is closed or open, the absorbent in the canister dries because of the continuous flow of gas. A retrograde flow is possible only in those Sulla anaesthetic machines where the fresh gas inlet is located below the inspiratory valve. A retrograde flow of gases causing absorbent desiccation can occur in a Cato, Julian, Fabius GS, or Primus anaesthetic machines with the Y-piece connector closed. Maintenance engineers point out that problems are reported mostly on Monday mornings before the first operation. 				Conclusions: After completed anaesthesia, the fresh gas inlets on the anaesthetic machine must always be closed. Especially in older machines, the carbon dioxide absorber must be checked before the first operation on a Monday morning. In new-generation machines, we must make sure that the emergency ventilation valve is closed after the end of anaesthesia...|$|R
40|$|Exploitation {{of space}} must {{benefit from the}} latest {{advances}} in robotics. On-orbit servicing is a clear candidate {{for the application of}} autonomous rendezvous and docking mechanisms. However, during the last three decades most of the trials took place combining extravehicular activities (EVAs) with telemanipulated robotic arms. The European Space Agency (ESA) considers that grasping and refuelling are promising near-mid-term capabilities that could be performed by servicing spacecraft. Minimal add-ons on spacecraft to enhance their serviceability may protect them for a changing future in which satellite servicing may become mainstream. ESA aims to conceive and promote standard refuelling provisions that can be installed in present and future European commercial geostationary orbit (GEO) satellite platforms and scientific spacecraft. For this purpose ESA has started the ASSIST activity addressing the analysis, design and validation of internal provisions (such as modifications to fuel, gas, electrical and data architecture to allow servicing) and external provisions (such as integrated berthing fixtures with peripheral electrical, <b>gas,</b> liquid <b>connectors,</b> leak check systems and corresponding optical and radio markers for cooperative rendezvous and docking). This refuelling approach is being agreed with European industry (OHB, Thales Alenia Space) and expected to be consolidated with European commercial operators as a first step to become an international standard; this approach is also being considered for on-orbit servicing spacecraft, such as the SpaceTug, by Airbus DS. This paper describes in detail the operational means, structure, geometry and accommodation of the system. Internal and external provisions will be designed with the minimum possible impact on the current architecture of GEO satellites without introducing additional risks in the development and commissioning of the satellite. Endeffector and berthing fixtures are being designed in the range of few kilos and linear dimensions around 15 cm. A central mechanical part is expected to perform first a soft docking followed by a motorized retraction ending during a hard docking phase using aligning pins. Mating and de-mating will be exhaustively analysed to ensure robustness of operations. Leakage-free valves would allow for the transfer of fuel to the serviced spacecraft. The validation of the ASSIST system through dedicated environmental tests in a vacuum chamber together with dynamic testing using an air-bearing table will allow for the demonstration of concept feasibility and its suitability for becoming a standard of the on-orbit space industry...|$|R
40|$|Underwater cables {{have been}} {{connecting}} continents since the 1860 s. Over time, {{the process of}} laying cables at sea has developed into a state-of-the-art operation. Now these operations are becoming more technologically advanced {{and it is possible}} to lay large diameter electric cables over large distances. One method is to lay cables in two or more lengths to have them jointed together mid-sea. A particular challenge will occur in case an unplanned splicing will be necessary. In this thesis, we will explore the design criteria for such cables and the procedures and challenges of installation. Furthermore, the effects of how dynamic motions of the vessel and sea influence the situation in deep water will be explored. The OrcaFlex software will be used to simulate and analyze the effects of waves on vessel motion, and how this may affect the cable during a jointing operation of two cables at different water depths. The effects of current forces on the cable are to be analyzed and how the cable reacts to both current and wave forces. This analysis method can assist in determining the weather criteria for a jointing operation to prevent excessive bending, compression or fatigue damage in the cable. When installing a cable in an area with currents, one needs {{to take into account the}} direction of the currents relative to the cable, as tension and bending of the cable are highly affected by the direction and strength of the current. From the OrcaFlex analysis, one can see that vessel motion due to waves are more critical to the cable with respect to fatigue damage in shallow water (100 m) than in deep water (1200 m). The residual bottom tension in the cable at the touch down point is, however, more sensitive to the vessel motion at deep water than in shallow water. In areas with waves and currents, a current approaching the cable at 0 degrees will decrease the critical parameters. The bottom tension is less affected by the vessel motion and the cable will experience less bending cycles over the laying wheel. With a large current approaching at 180 degrees (i. e. toward the vessel), the bending of the cable increases and hence the cable may experience fatigue damage sooner. The bottom tension in the cable will become more sensitive to vessel motions in this situation and the risk of loops developing will increase as tension decreases. By changing the location of the laying wheel, one can improve the situation. Placing the wheel closer to the center of the stern will reduce the effect of vessel motion on cable tension. The cyclic bending of the cable is, however, less affected by changing the laying wheel location. A HAZID carried out for cable installation, shows that there are many risks and hazardous events that may occur during the operation in connection to the cables integrity. Handling these risks early may reduce both their probability of occurring and the related consequences. One finding in the analysis is that there are different requirements for laying cable and jointing operations. The suitable sea states for jointing are more limited than for laying. When vessel and cable are standing still, all bending occurs at the same place in the cable, resulting in increased risk of fatigue damage, hence it is necessary with a calmer sea state for this kind of operation. Future work might emphasis on developing quick connectors to quickly join cable ends offshore. Reference is here made to the offshore oil and <b>gas</b> industry’s underwater <b>connectors...</b>|$|R
