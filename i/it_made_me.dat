[...] Detroit rapper Elzhi states, [...] "round the time Nas did Illmatic, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> wanna step my game up...

She wrote, [...] "It sure took them long enough, but we're so glad to finally see Kurt happy." [...] In his review, Mark Perigard opined, [...] "It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold {{the hell out of}} the moment. It’s long overdue and it will silence the growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with the pace of this story and why Kurt always seemed to be stuck in pure misery." [...] Robert Canning was more critical on the storyline. He highly criticized Darren Criss' performance as Blaine. In a detailed review regarding the storyline, Canning wrote, [...] "Kurt finally got the first kiss he deserved. Too bad it came from the wooden, glass-eyed Blaine. Chris Colfer has been in the running for performance awards for good reason. Darren Criss will not be.
