Methods A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted with 396 parents of 3 to 5 year-old children attending 30 preschools within the Hunter region, New South Wales, Australia.

Further, to investigate whether plasma antioxidants are good biomarkers for intake of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables. Design : Patients with type 2 diabetes were studied. Their dietary intake and levels of plasma antioxidants, and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation were analysed. Results : <b>Fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable intake was inversely related to oxidative stress. Plasma carotenoids were negatively correlated with inflammation.

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldBACKGROUND/AIMS: Children in Europe are consuming less <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables than recommended. Knowledge about the potential determinants of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable intake is vital to understand discrepancies in intake and to guide interventions. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess personal, social and environmental factors regarding <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable intake among 11 - to 12 -year-old children in Europe. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken, with nationally or regionally representative samples of in total 13, 305 children (mean age 11. 4 years) from nine European countries. Pupils in the classroom completed a self-administered questionnaire measuring <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable intake and personal, social and environmental factors during one school lesson. Age-adjusted covariance analyses were carried out by gender, for the full sample and for each country separately. Proportions responding positively to the constructs are presented. RESULTS: Overall, European children held a positive attitude towards <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable intake. For some constructs, large between-country differences were found. Children had a more positive attitude towards fruit than towards vegetables, and girls were on average more positive than boys. The children perceived their social environment as supportive towards <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable intake. They reported good to very good availability of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables at home. However, availability at school and during leisure time activities seemed to be low, both for <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> for vegetables.

40|$|Efforts to {{increase}} <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable consump­tion {{are a significant}} aspect of national approaches to preventive health. However, policy frameworks for increasing <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable consumption rarely take an integrated food-systems approach that includes a focus on production. In this policy analysis and commentary we examine <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable production in peri-urban areas of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia, and highlight the significance of emerging environmental and eco­nomic pressures on <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable production. This examination will {{be of interest to}} other locations around the world also experiencing pressure on their peri-urban agriculture. These pressures suggest that the availability <b>and</b> afforda­bility of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable supplies cannot be taken for granted, and that future initiatives {{to increase}} <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable consumption should include a focus on sustainable production. Threats to production that include environmental pressures, together with the loss and cost of peri-urban agri­cultural land and a cost-price squeeze due to rising input costs and low farm-gate prices, act in combi­nation to threaten the viability of the Victorian <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable industries. We pro­pose that policy initiatives to increase <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable consumption should include measures to address the pressures facing production, and that the most effective policy responses are likely to be integrated approaches that aim to increase <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable availability and affordability through innovative solutions to problems of production and distribu­tion. Some brief examples of potential integrated policy solutions are identified to illu­strate the possibilities and stimulate discussion. <br /...|$|R
