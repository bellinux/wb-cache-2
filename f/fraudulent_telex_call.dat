50|$|Not all {{ship-to-shore}} {{radio communications}} were short range. Some radio stations provided long-range radiotelephony services, such as radio telegrams and radio <b>telex</b> <b>calls,</b> on the HF bands (3-30 MHz) enabling worldwide communications with ships. For example, Portishead Radio, {{which was the}} world's busiest radiotelephony station, provided HF long-range services. In 1974, it had 154 radio operators who handled over 20 million words per year. Such large radiotelephony stations employed {{large numbers of people}} and were expensive to operate. By the end of the 1980s, satellite services had started to take an increasingly large share of the market for ship-to-shore communications.|$|R

40|$|Introduction 1. 1 Scope 1. 1. 1 These {{provisions}} fix {{the rules}} to be followed in the international telex service. Telex is a telegraph service for subscribers whereby they can communicate directly and temporarily between themselves using start-stop telegraph equipment operating at 50 bauds and with International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2. 1. 1. 2 Questions of an essentially technical nature concerning the telex service are dealt with by other CCITT Recommendations. 1. 2 Definitions 1. 2. 1 The following terms used in these provisions have the undermentioned definitions: emergency routes F: voies de secours S: rutas de emergencia The circuit(s) {{to be used in}} case of complete interruption or major breakdown of the primary and secondary routes.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s, {{satellite}} communications had started to take an increasing share of the station's business, and a programme of severe rationalisation began, leading to the closure of two transmitting sites at Leafield and Ongar. In the radio station's penultimate year to March 1999, there were on average, per month, 571 radio telegrams, 533 radio telephone calls and 4,001 radio <b>telex</b> <b>calls.</b> In 1998, British Telecom Maritime Radio Services announced its planned closure of Portishead Radio. The long-range services (HF bands 3–30MHz) ceased at midnight on 31 August 1999. The short-range VHF maritime band services (156–174MHz) closed at 12:00 on Sunday 30 April 2000, and the medium-range services (MF maritime band 1.6–3.0MHz) at 12:00 on Friday 30 June. The station closed in April 2000. The Highbridge station has been demolished. Sedgemoor District Council adopted a local development plan in September 2004 that included the site of the receiving station for future housing development. Planning permission was granted in October 2007 for a development of 190houses and flats on the site and shortly afterwards the old radio station buildings were demolished.|$|R

5000|$|A background/foreground {{operation}} was envisaged in teletex. Transmission/reception of messages should proceed {{in the background}} without affecting the work which the user might be carrying out in the foreground with the equipment. In other words, a user might be preparing a new document, while another document was being transmitted or received. The teletex would also maintain compatibility with the present telex system and inter-operate with it. <b>Telex</b> procedures <b>called</b> for the exchange of header information before the actual document transfer took place. The header information consisted of four parts: ...|$|R
50|$|Telegraphy {{did not go}} away on radio. Instead, {{the degree}} of {{automation}} increased. On land-lines in the 1930s, teletypewriters automated encoding, and were adapted to pulse-code dialing to automate routing, a service <b>called</b> <b>telex.</b> For thirty years, telex was the absolute cheapest form of long-distance communication, because up to 25 telex channels could occupy the same bandwidth as one voice channel. For business and government, it was an advantage that telex directly produced written documents.|$|R

Inmarsat has traditionally provided professional communication to ships and is now actively implementing new systems for use on land, in the air, and at sea. These new systems can provide near global communication for anyone on the move. By 1993, four new systems will provide telephony, <b>telex,</b> data, group <b>call</b> and facsimile at affordable cost to a very wide range of users.

40|$|International audienceDeveloping write-sharing {{applications}} is challenging. Remote and {{offline data}} sharing are increasingly important. We propose a generic platform <b>called</b> <b>Telex</b> to ease development {{and to provide}} guarantees. Telex is driven by application semantics. Telex takes care of replication and persistence, drives application progress, and ensures that replicas eventually agree on a correct, common state. We show by example how application design proceeds from high-level application invariants to application-provided parameters that guides Telex. The main data structure of Telex is a large, replicated, highly dynamic graph; we discuss the engineering trade-offs for such a graph and our solutions. Finally, we report an experimental evaluation of Telex based on a cooperative calendar application and on benchmarks...|$|R
5000|$|New Zealand & Canada {{are both}} {{exclusive}} {{members of a}} collection of five countries who participate in the highly secretive ECHELON program. New Zealand has two (known) listening posts run by the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) as part of the ECHELON spy network. New Zealand has benefited from its role in the ECHELON communications interception network which also includes the United States, Australia, Britain and Canada and are known as the UKUSA Community. The partnership gives [...] "a direct line into the inner circles of power in London and Washington".New Zealand's role in the program is based at a listening post on the South Island of New Zealand at Waihopai Valley just south-west of Blenheim. Its primary role is the interception of a large volume of satellite phone <b>calls,</b> <b>telexes,</b> faxes, e-mail and computer data communications. It gathers this data from New Zealand's Asia/Pacific neighbours and forwards it on to the major partners in the UKUSA Agreement.|$|R
5000|$|On October 15, 1970, {{during the}} October Crisis, Secretary of State Gérard Pelletier {{convinced}} CBC President George Davidson {{that the situation}} in Quebec threatened to grow into a widespread insurrection that would threaten the Canadian state, and that CBC reporting should not [...] "inflame" [...] the situation. Davidson asked Nash to ensure that CBC News would not indulge in [...] "speculative discussions" [...] about the crisis — in effect, self-censoring any political commentary. Nash immediately sent out a Telex to CBC staff to that effect. Two hours later, after some introspection, Nash {{realized that he was}} agreeing to government interference in the CBC's reportage, and modified his <b>Telex</b> to instead <b>call</b> for [...] "responsible journalistic professionalism". Nash was candidly self-critical about his role in allowing the two hours of self-censorship, and later wrote, [...] "I certainly was not skeptical enough about what Pelletier had said to Davidson and let my nationalism override my journalistic values. There are times when that is necessary, but this wasn't one of them and I was wrong." ...|$|R
