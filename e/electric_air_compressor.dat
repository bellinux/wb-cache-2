50|$|A hybrid {{turbocharger}} is {{an electric}} turbocharger {{consisting of a}} high speed turbine-generator and a high speed <b>electric</b> <b>air</b> <b>compressor.</b> The turbine and compressor are high-speed aeromachines, as in a conventional turbocharger. The electrical motors run at speeds in excess of 120,000 rpm and when used as generators, generate electricity at up to 98.5% electrical efficiency. High electrical efficiency is paramount, {{because there is no}} mechanical link between the turbine and compressor. In other words, hybrid turbocharger refers to a series hybrid setup, in which compressor speed and power are independent from turbine speed and power. This design flexibility leads to further improvements in turbine and compressor efficiency, beyond a conventional turbocharger.|$|E

Inflating a balloon via the mouth {{is difficult and}} can be dangerous. Particularly well-trained and talented twisters, however, can blow-up several balloons at once, and some can even blow up 160s, which are {{much more difficult to}} mouth-inflate than the more common 260s, as their narrowness requires a great deal more strength and breath pressure to inflate.|$|R

The main advantage with this voltage is versatility {{of the electric}} system, {{such as the ability}} to charge a cell phone battery with a cigar lighter receptacle as cell phones are now becoming more and more needed for users, though 5 volt USB is also used for that purpose too. It also allows <b>electric</b> <b>air</b> <b>compressors</b> to fix flat tires. Some 12 volt dynamos are available too, though their watt rating is underpowered for medium to high watt applications.|$|R

50|$|The {{next step}} in the snowmaking process is to add air using an air plant. This plant is often a {{building}} which contains electric or diesel industrial <b>air</b> <b>compressors</b> the size of a van or truck. However, in some instances air compression is provided using diesel-powered, portable trailer-mounted compressors which can be added to the system. Many fan-type snow guns have on-board <b>electric</b> <b>air</b> <b>compressors,</b> which allows for cheaper, and more compact operation. A ski area may have the required high-output water pumps, but not an <b>air</b> pump. Onboard <b>compressors</b> are cheaper and easier than having a dedicated pumping house. The air is generally cooled and excess moisture is removed before it is sent out of the plant. Some systems even cool the water before it enters the system. This improves the snowmaking process as the less heat in the air and water, the less heat must be dissipated to the atmosphere to freeze the water. From this plant the air travels up a separate pipeline following the same path as the water pipeline.|$|R
5000|$|Fog signals have {{received}} much attention at Point Betsie. In {{the autumn of}} 1912, the fog signal building was rebuilt. The 10 in locomotive whistles were replaced by 10 inch chime whistles. Meanwhile, the lamp was upgraded to an incandescent oil vapor system, with an intensity of 55,000 candlepower. In 1921, upon being connected to the electrical power grid, aa 110-volt electric bulb was installed, and the fog signal upgraded to twin Type [...] "G" [...] diaphones, driven by <b>electric</b> <b>air</b> <b>compressors.</b> The diaphone doubled the audible radius, and had the added benefit {{that it could be}} brought on line immediately, without waiting for steam engines to build pressure. The following April the fog signal's characteristic was changed to a group of two blasts every 30 seconds. [...] Dismantled and sold as junk to the local residents in the 1970s, who hauled it away, all original fog horn apparatus has long since disappeared and is no longer on site.|$|R

50|$|Over {{the last}} decade or so air {{suspension}} has become popular in the custom automobile culture: street rods, trucks, cars, and even motorcycles may have air springs. They are used in these applications to provide an adjustable suspension which allows vehicles to sit extremely low, yet be able rise to a level high enough to manoeuver over obstacles and inconsistencies on paved surfaces. These systems generally employ small, <b>electric</b> or engine-driven <b>air</b> <b>compressors</b> which sometimes fill an on-board air receiver tank which stores compressed air for use in the future without delay. These air receiver tanks aid in improving speed or torque. It is important that the tank is sized for the task and can be calculated using a specific formula involving the compressor output, standard atmospheric pressure and compressed pressure.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — <b>Air</b> <b>{{compress}}or,</b> as {{the name}} indicates, is a machine to compress the air and to raise its pressure. The <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> sucks <b>air</b> from the atmosphere, compresses it and then delivers the same under a high pressure {{to a place where}} the supply of compressed air is required. It is based on the energy stored in air under pressure and the heart of the system is the <b>air</b> <b>compressor.</b> To run these <b>air</b> <b>compressors,</b> a lot of electrical energy is required depending upon the output pressure of the air.

40|$|Compressed {{air systems}} in a Vietnamese {{footwear}} manufacturing enterprise consume about 10 % of enterprise's total electric power supply. Energy efficiency of these <b>air</b> <b>compressor</b> systems, either equipped with new and efficient compressors or old and inefficient ones, can only reach between 5 % and 10 %. In other words, regardless whatever <b>air</b> <b>compressors</b> were installed, energy loss from the compressor systems was over 80 %.
