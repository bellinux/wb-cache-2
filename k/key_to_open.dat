Valkog demands the key from Jaster {{who is about to}} acquiesce, when Raul fires an electromagnetic pulse at the Emperor, partially disabling it. However, the ship fires on Raul's church before retreating. Raul dies in Jaster's arms after giving him an artifact which points to the apparently deserted Kuje Desert. In the middle of Kuje, the party find a village, Joannasburg. There, they meet the spirit of the long dead Joanna (C. C. Seymour). She explains she is a descendent of the Star King, as is her son; Jaster. Desert Claw arrives, telling Jaster he is his father. He gave Jaster to Raul while he prepared for the day when Jaster would awaken the power of the Star King and open the Gates of Eden.|$|E

25|$|John Winchester {{gives it}} to the demon Azazel in return for Dean's life being spared after a near-fatal car crash. At {{the end of the}} second season, Azazel uses the Colt as the <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> one of the Gates to Hell that Samuel Colt had sealed. The last bullet is then used to kill Azazel, though the gun is later altered to allow the use of more bullets. Towards the end of the third season, Lilith's {{right-hand}} demon, Crowley, acquires the gun and hides it. It is then featured in two time-travel episodes – Dean using a past version of it when he is sent back to 1973, and his future self discovering it when Dean is sent five years into the future – before Crowley returns it to the Winchesters so they can kill Lucifer. However, after Dean shoots Lucifer in the head at point-blank range, an unharmed Lucifer boasts there are five things in creation which the gun cannot kill, and he is one of them. The Colt is subsequently lost and absent for several years until Mary Winchester retrieves it back from a Prince of Hell, Ramiel.|$|E

In India, Donald enters the palace of the Maharajah, where she challenges him to defeat the tiger in her garden {{in exchange for a}} Sphinx Tear. Donald succeeds and receives the Sphinx Tear, which is the <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> a temple in Egypt. Donald is able to solve the [...] "Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] using the note Goofy had given him, and obtains the Scepter of Ra before escaping in a mine cart. From there, he journeys to the South Pole, where he finds a key frozen in ice, and uses the Scepter of Ra to melt the ice and grab the key. The key unlocks the hold of a Viking ship, which contains an ancient diary with the secret to locating the treasure. The ship is haunted by ghosts, and the Viking captain sends Donald below decks to get rid of them. After defeating a skeletal Viking warrior, Donald returns to the deck, where the captain informs him that the diary is hidden in ice near the South Pole, and gives him an [...] "ancient Viking plunger" [...] that attaches to flying creatures. Donald then returns to the South Pole, hitching a ride on one of Pete's bird minions to reach the diary.|$|E
500|$|At the pentagram's {{center is}} an old cowboy cemetery, which Azazel forces Jake to go to by {{threatening}} his family. The Winchesters, Bobby, and Ellen are there to meet him, but Jake, having given in to his demonic side, develops mind-control abilities and orders Ellen to put her gun to her head. Everyone is forced to lower their weapons, giving Jake time to use the Colt as a <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> a mausoleum. However, Sam then shoots Jake in the back, and finishes him off with multiple shots as he begs for mercy. As the mausoleum doors begin to open, they {{realize that it is}} a Devil's Gate—a doorway to Hell. A rush of demons then escape and break the iron railway lines of the devil's trap, allowing Azazel to enter. As Ellen and Bobby try to close the gateway, Sam and Dean take the Colt to confront Azazel. Unfortunately, the demon catches them by surprise and takes the gun. After taunting Dean about his demonic pact and questioning if what came back was [...] "one hundred percent pure Sam", Azazel prepares to kill them. To his surprise, the escaped spirit of John Winchester (Morgan) grabs him, distracting him long enough for Dean to take back the Colt and shoot him in the heart, finally killing him. As Bobby and Ellen manage to close the gates, John's spirit moves on. Knowing that they now have to face an army of demons, Sam promises to try to free Dean from his deal.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2007, in Ohio, 16-year-old Daniel Petric snuck out of {{his bedroom}} window to {{purchase}} the game Halo 3 against the orders of his father, a minister at New Life Assembly of God in Wellington, Ohio, U.S. His parents eventually banned him from the game after he spent up to 18 hours a day with it, and secured it in a lockbox in a closet where the father also kept a 9mm handgun according to prosecutors. In October 2007, Daniel used his father's <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the lockbox and remove the gun and the game. He then entered {{the living room of}} his house and shot both of them in the head, killing his mother and wounding his father. Petric was {{sentenced to life in prison}} without parole, which was later commuted to 23 years in prison. Defense attorneys argued that Petric was influenced by video game addiction. The court dismissed these claims. The judge, James Burge, commented that while he thought there was ample evidence the boy knew what he was doing, Burge thought the game had affected him like a drug, saying [...] "I firmly believe that Daniel Petric had no idea at the time he hatched this plot that if he killed his parents they would be dead forever." ...|$|E

Now, as you are aware, gold is a very scarce commodity with me. Then, after getting her out, a lavish expenditure would be needed for our flight.

All this came to his mind, with a distinct recollection that he must be his own physician and nurse. For a few minutes he lay still, during which he addressed himself to God, with thanks for having spared his life until reason was restored. Then he bethought him, well as his feeble state would allow, of the course he ought to pursue. On a table in the cabin, and in sight of his berth, through the state-room door, was a liquor-case, containing wines, brandy, and gin. Our sick man thought all might yet go well, could he get a few spoonsfull of an excellent port wine which that case, contained, and which had been provided expressly for cases of sickness. To do this, however, it was necessary to obtain the <b>key,</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the case, and to pour out the liquor; three things, of which he distrusted his powers to perform that which was the least difficult.|$|E

First a monks' house, it fell at the Reformation to some greedy gentleman who made it his dwelling, and doubtless in later times it was used as a farm-house. Now a house most desolate, dirty, and neglected, with cracks in the walls which threaten ruin, standing in a wilderness of weeds, tenanted by a poor working-man whose wages are twelve shillings a week, and his wife and eight small children. The rent is eighteen-pence a week--probably the lowest-rented manor-house in England, though it is not very rare to find such places tenanted by labourers.|$|E
