5|$|The next day, Peter {{gets the}} Lizard photos {{published}} in the Bugle and gets the money he needs. However, when Gwen, Eddie, and the Connors find out, they are outraged that he ran off simply to take pictures and say he has lost their trust. Although Martha understands the <b>difficult</b> <b>choices</b> that Peter had, she fires him. He secretly grabs another vial of gene cleanser and returns home, frustrated about his reputation. Blaming the events that gave him his powers, {{he is about to}} take the vial when he sees a photo of himself with Ben.

5|$|The {{production}} team's {{approach to}} the character and Eccleston's portrayal were highlighted as being intentionally different from his predecessors, with Eccleston stating that his character would be less eccentric. To fit in with a 21st-century audience, the Doctor was given a primary companion, Rose Tyler, who {{was designed to be}} as independent and courageous as himself. He also briefly travels with Adam Mitchell, a self-serving boy genius who acts as a foil to the companions but ultimately proves unworthy, and Jack Harkness, a reformed con man from the 51st century. The Doctor, Rose and Jack form a close team but are separated in the series finale in which each character has to make <b>difficult</b> <b>choices</b> and face sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|With the {{surrender}} of Fort Henry, the Confederates faced some <b>difficult</b> <b>choices.</b> Grant's army now divided Confederate Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston's two main forces: P.G.T. Beauregard at Columbus, Kentucky, with 12,000 men, and William J. Hardee at Bowling Green, Kentucky, with 22,000 men. Fort Donelson had only about 5,000 men. Union forces might attack Columbus; they might attack Fort Donelson and thereby threaten Nashville, Tennessee; or Grant and Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, who was quartered in Louisville with 45,000 men, might attack Johnston head-on, with Grant following behind Buell. Johnston was apprehensive about {{the ease with which}} Union gunboats defeated Fort Henry (not comprehending that the rising waters of the Tennessee River played a crucial role by inundating the fort). He was more concerned about the threat from Buell than he was from Grant, and suspected the river operations might simply be a diversion.|$|E

25|$|In Angels {{third season}} (2001–2002), Wesley's path becomes filled with tragedies and <b>difficult</b> <b>choices.</b> Just {{as he starts}} {{developing}} romantic feelings for his teammate Fred (Amy Acker), he finds himself mystically influenced to kill her after a demon influences him to become homicidally misogynistic. While studying the birth of Angel's infant son Connor, Wesley discovers a prophecy which claims that Angel will kill the baby. Intending {{to take him to}} safety, Wesley betrays his friends and kidnaps Connor, a decision which has disastrous consequences when he has his throat slit and the baby is kidnapped into a hell dimension by Angel's sworn enemy, Holtz. Angel then attempts to kill him while he is in recovery at the hospital. Alienated from Angel Investigations, a recovered Wesley forms his own team to fight evil, but maintains an interest in his former friends' affairs. He also begins a sexual relationship with Wolfram & Hart lawyer Lilah Morgan (Stephanie Romanov), who tries to convince him to join the firm. In the fourth season (2002–2003), Angel is rescued and revived by Wesley after being sunk {{to the bottom of the}} ocean by his now-adolescent son Connor (Vincent Kartheiser). Wesley eventually returns to the team full-time to help them battle the Beast, making difficult decisions such as seeking the aid of Angel's evil alter ego Angelus and breaking Faith out of prison. Having developed genuine feelings for Lilah, he mourns her when she is killed by Cordelia, now possessed by the entity known as Jasmine (Gina Torres). In the season finale, following the defeat of Jasmine, Wesley joins the rest of Angel Investigations in taking over Wolfram & Hart in the hopes that they can turn it into a power for good.|$|E
500|$|Another main {{theme is}} {{regarding}} the [...] "yōkais choice". As {{agents of the}} city, the two karas represent different paths {{for the good of}} the city. The yōkai have to make a choice to support one of them. By following Eko, the humans are enslaved, and the presence of the yōkai will be imposed on them. By standing behind Otoha, the yōkai accept their lot and continue trying to live with the humans. Using the yōkai-human relationship as an analogy for human-human interaction, the team suggested people should be open and make the move, instead of passively staying in the background hoping for results. Ibira applied this to decision making, saying when faced with <b>difficult</b> <b>choices,</b> one should make a decision instead of hoping for others to make it for them.|$|E

500|$|Devil Survivor 2: The Animation was {{produced}} by the Bridge animation studio of Japan using a team henceforth known as the Devil Survivor 2: The Animation Committee. The series was directed by veteran anime director Seiji Kishi best known for directing the anime adaptation of Atlus's 2008 video game [...] During production Kishi remarked that the calamity of which the story describes was reminiscent of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. He also praised the animated depictions of Suzuhito Yasuda's character designs. Makoto Uezu was selected as both the script writer and series composer for the anime. In an interview Uezu commented {{that he had been}} a huge fan of the Megami Tensei series since his childhood and that his interests in the occult and electronic technology aided in the composition. Uezu further remarked that the story followed a [...] "hard path" [...] whereby the heroes were forced into making <b>difficult</b> <b>choices</b> at key points in the plot whilst the characters simultaneously explored sensitive issues related to human ethics and morality.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} overall well {{received}} by game critics. Greg Miller of IGN considered the title to be [...] "one {{of the best}} PlayStation 3 games to date". Core to the game's success, according to reviewers, were the basic mechanics of the game. [...] Giant Bomb's Brad Shoemaker considered that Sucker Punch had [...] "nailed the basic gameplay elements", tying all the {{various aspects of the}} game together. The mixture of Cole's powers with the Karma elements of the game were also praised. The powers and Karma system were seen to bring <b>difficult</b> <b>choices</b> to how the player approach battles. Both sides of the Karma system were considered to be fun to play. The mission structure was considered a strong asset of the game. According to X-Play's Matt Kiel, the missions forced the player to consider the full extent of Cole's powers through their difficulty but provided [...] "generous" [...] checkpoints to prevent too much frustration with the game. Reviewers cited the variation in side missions and how they related to the main story as positive aspects of the game.|$|E
500|$|There are {{multiple}} features {{omitted from the}} game that the team considered typical of most video games, such as boss fights. A traditional cover system was excluded for the game as the team wanted players to constantly move around. The team also attempted to cause players to {{feel as though they}} are lacking, particularly in the supplies that they collect. [...] "You're not building yourself into a tank," [...] said Straley. This also motivated many of the design decisions of the gameplay, such as the weightlessness of the animations, and the melee combat mechanic. To further add to the realism, the team developed the game's combat mechanic in a way that forces players to spend more time planning. They also wanted players to be forced to retreat from combat after alerting the Infected, despite their belief that retreating is the [...] "anti-video game play mechanic". The combat mechanic was developed to feel intense, intentionally moving the camera closer to players, {{in order for them to}} [...] "feel every strike". The team felt that the game forces players to make <b>difficult</b> <b>choices,</b> in terms of combat, stealth and resource management, allowing them to understand the decisions made by the characters.|$|E

500|$|According to {{an account}} {{published}} by H. A. Wise in 1847, Jean Baptiste Trudeau boasted {{of his own}} heroism, but also spoke in lurid detail of eating Jacob Donner, and claimed he had eaten a baby raw. Many years later, Trudeau met Eliza Donner Houghton and denied cannibalizing anyone, which he reiterated {{in an interview with}} a St. Louis newspaper in 1891, when he was 60 years old. Houghton and the other Donner children were fond of Trudeau, and he of them, in spite of their circumstances {{and the fact that he}} eventually left Tamsen Donner alone. Author George Stewart considers Trudeau's accounting to Wise more accurate than what he told Houghton in 1884, and asserted that he deserted the Donners. [...] Kristin Johnson, on the other hand, attributes Trudeau's interview with Wise to be a result of [...] "common adolescent desires to be the center of attention and to shock one's elders"; when older, he reconsidered his story, so as not to upset Houghton. Historians Joseph King and Jack Steed call Stewart's characterization of Trudeau's actions as desertion [...] "extravagant moralism", particularly because all members of the party were forced to make <b>difficult</b> <b>choices.</b> Ethan Rarick echoed this by writing, [...] "more than the gleaming heroism or sullied villainy, the Donner Party is a story of hard decisions that were neither heroic nor villainous".|$|E

2500|$|The Time Quintet shows {{themes of}} love, loss, friendship, {{loneliness}} and {{the triumph of}} good over evil. L'Engle often borrows elements from the Bible in a way similar to C. S. Lewis, {{one of her favorite}} authors. In A Wrinkle in Time, for example, the beautiful creatures of Uriel sing a psalm, and Mrs. Who quotes St. Paul; and angelic characters — the three [...] "Mrs. Ws", the [...] "singular cherubim" [...] Proginoskes, and the seraph Aradnaral, among others — aid the Murrys and Calvin, but still leave the humans to make their own <b>difficult</b> <b>choices.</b> Another theme which echoes Lewis's work is that phenomena which human perception classifies as [...] "science", [...] "religion" [...] and [...] "magic" [...] are in actuality part of a single seamless reality.|$|E
2500|$|The {{short-term}} {{election cycle}} {{coupled with the}} inability {{to stay focused on}} long term objectives motivates American presidents to lean towards actions that would appease the citizenry, and, as a rule, avoid complicated international issues and <b>difficult</b> <b>choices.</b> Thus, Brzezinski criticized the Clinton presidency as having a foreign policy which lacked [...] "discipline and passion" [...] and subjected the U.S. to [...] "eight years of drift." [...] In comparison, the next, Bush presidency was criticized for many impulsive decisions that harmed the international standing of the U.S. in the world. Former director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lt. Gen. Gregory S. Newbold commented that, [...] "There's a broad naïvete in the political class about America's obligations in foreign policy issues, and scary simplicity about the effects that employing American military power can achieve".|$|E
2500|$|Rosecrans did not {{immediately}} pursue Bragg and [...] "give the finishing blow to the rebellion" [...] as Stanton had urged. He paused to regroup and study the logistically <b>difficult</b> <b>choices</b> of pursuit into the mountainous regions {{to the west and}} south of Chattanooga. When he was ready to move, he once again maneuvered in a way to disadvantage Bragg. The Confederates abandoned Chattanooga and withdrew into the mountains of northwestern Georgia. Rosecrans threw aside his previous caution under the assumption that Bragg would continue to retreat and began to pursue with his army over three routes that left his corps commanders dangerously far apart. At the Battle of Davis's Cross Roads on September 11, Bragg came close to ambushing and destroying one of Rosecrans's isolated corps. Realizing the threat at last, Rosecrans issued urgent orders to concentrate his army and the two opponents faced each other across West Chickamauga Creek.|$|E
