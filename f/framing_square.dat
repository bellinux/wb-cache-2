50|$|A Speed Square (rafter square, rafter angle square, {{triangle}} square) is a triangular-shaped, carpenters' {{marking out}} tool manufactured and sold by Swanson Tool Co., Inc. The Speed Square combines {{some of the}} most common functions of the combination square, try square, and <b>framing</b> <b>square</b> into one. It is used to make basic measurements and mark lines on dimensional lumber, and may be used as a saw guide for making short 45 and 90 degree cuts.|$|E
50|$|A sliding T bevel, {{also known}} as a bevel gauge or false square is an {{adjustable}} gauge for setting and transferring angles. The handle is usually made of wood or plastic and is connected to a metal blade with a thumbscrew or wing nut. The blade pivots and can be locked at any angle by loosening or tightening the thumbscrew.The bevel can be used to duplicate an existing angle, or set to a desired angle by using it with any number of other measuring tools (such as a protractor, or <b>framing</b> <b>square).</b>|$|E

50|$|The only <b>Framing</b> <b>Square</b> {{that has}} tables for unequal pitched roofs is the Chappell Universal Square, (patent #7,958,645). There {{is also a}} {{comprehensive}} rafter table for 6 & 8 sided polygon roofs (first time ever on a framing square).The traditional steel square's rafter table (patented April 23,1901) is limited in {{that it does not}} have tables that allow for work with unequal pitched roofs. Irregular hip/valley rafters are characterized by plan angles that are not equal or 45°. The top plates can be 90° at the outside corners or various other angles. There are numerous irregular h/v roof plans.|$|E
50|$|The {{steel square}} {{is a tool}} used in carpentry. Carpenters use various tools to lay out {{structures}} that are square (that is, built at accurately measured right angles), {{many of which are}} made of steel, but the name steel square refers to a specific long-armed square that has additional uses for measurement, especially of various angles. Today the steel square is more commonly referred to as the <b>framing</b> <b>square</b> or carpenter's square. It consists of a long arm and a shorter arm, which meet at an angle of 90 degrees (a right angle). It can also be made of aluminum or polymers, which are light and resistant to rust.|$|E

40|$|An {{old idea}} for {{compounding}} magic squares is updated with modern computational methods {{in order to}} facilitate the generation of very large-order numerical matrices, including magic squares. A base square is incremented by multiples of the sum of its elements to provide subsquares of another <b>frame</b> <b>square.</b> If the base and frame are di¤erent, a second compound square results from their interchange, while identical squares may be said to generate fractal squares, i. e. self-similar on di¤erent scales. If both squares are magic (all rows, columns and the main diag-onals having the same sum), then the compound square is also magic. Extremely large squares can be obtained easily by iteratively repeating the compounding process, either with the square itself, its base or <b>frame</b> <b>square,</b> or with yet another di¤erent square. 1 De 8 ̆ 5 nitions We begin with a list of de 8 ̆ 5 nitions [1] to facilitate the present study of magic squares and some closely related issues: A classical magic square [2] is the set of n 2 (n> 2) sequential integers 1 ::n 2 arranged {{in the form of an}} n n array whose rows, columns and diagonals have the same sum (constant) ...|$|R

50|$|The JM mount {{consisted}} of a thick, metal, <b>square</b> <b>frame,</b> sized {{to fit into a}} standard French fortification embrasure (opening); the guns were mounted on an equally heavy-duty pivoting cradle inside this <b>frame.</b> The <b>square</b> <b>frame</b> fit snugly into the embrasure and was attached by hinges and bolts. This ensured that there were no gaps where enemy bullets could enter into the bunker (except the very small opening that the telescopic sight peeped through), yet allowed the guns to be aimed and trained on anyone outside the walls. Emplacements were often shared with an anti-tank gun sharing the same embrasure opening; the JM mount would be hinged back, and the anti-tank gun slid forward on its ceiling-mounted rail, until its barrel was outside and breech inside. It was surrounded by a similar <b>square</b> <b>frame,</b> which fit tightly into the embrasure. The only time the occupants of the bunker were exposed to enemy fire, was in the brief moments when switching the machine gun mounting for an artillery mount.|$|R

The main altar is elegantly built with colored marble and gilded wood frames and statuary. The church of San Crisogono once was located inside the castle of Montechiaro. The castle was located between {{the town of}} Mogliano and Corridonia. Destroyed in the 14th-century, the castle church's title was transferred to this church. After the erection of the adjacent Benedictine nunnery, and by 1652, the church was being designated in documents {{with the names of}} the two saints, Crisogono and Benedict.|$|R

Alfred Dolge wrote Mathushek perfected a simplified press for applying felt covering to piano hammers in 1850, and in 1851 he patented a method for overstringing in cast iron <b>frame</b> <b>square</b> pianos to allow a greater number of strings with larger diameters. The arrangement was intended to improve tone and stability, and it became known as the sweep scale because it distributed the strings much farther apart on the sounding board than more conventional methods of stringing.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} whether the biological relevance of the stimulus could enhance task-irrelevant spatial information delivered by a pair of bilateral stimuli. Participants had to perform a Simon-like task in which they were required to respond to the color of two <b>framed</b> <b>squares</b> (on and off-centered), two framed arrows, or two schematic eyes by pressing one of two keys on the left and on the right of the body midline. Results showed that regardless of stimulus type responses towards the direction indicated by the stimuli (corresponding stimulus-response pairings) were faster than responses against it (non-corresponding stimulus-response pairings). It is argued that the biological relevance of the stimuli does not seem to play a crucial role in the automatic processing of stimulus inherent spatial properties...|$|R
50|$|In {{woodworking}} and carpentry, {{a pair of}} winding sticks is a {{tool that}} aids in viewing twist or wind in pieces of lumber (timber) by amplifying the defect. Winding sticks {{can be as simple}} as any two straight sticks or they can be elegant, decorated, dimensionally stable wood like mahogany. A pair of <b>framing</b> <b>squares</b> may also be suitable. Traditionally they are 16 in to 30 in long 1.75 in tall and tapered in their height from 3/8 in to 1/8 in. The longer the winding sticks, the more they will amplify the wind. It is common for a woodworker to make a matching pair for the purpose, and contrasting colors of woods improve the discernability of differences in height and level between the two sticks as they are compared.|$|R
