5|$|A {{compound}} that has two immiscible <b>hydrophilic</b> and hydrophobic parts {{within the same}} molecule is called an amphiphilic molecule. Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the <b>hydrophilic</b> part and hydrophobic part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.|$|E
5|$|As the {{surfactants}} are absorbed, the solid–vapor {{surface tension}} increases and {{the edges of}} the drop become <b>hydrophilic.</b> As a result, the drop spreads.|$|E
5|$|Krypton-83 has {{application}} in {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) for imaging airways. In particular, it enables the radiologist to distinguish between hydrophobic and <b>hydrophilic</b> surfaces containing an airway.|$|E
5|$|New {{materials}} {{may make}} even better collectors. One such material {{is inspired by}} the Namib Desert beetle, which survives only on the moisture it extracts from the atmosphere. It {{has been found that}} its back is coated with microscopic projections: the peaks are <b>hydrophilic</b> and the troughs are hydrophobic. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have emulated this capability by creating a textured surface that combines alternating hydrophobic and <b>hydrophilic</b> materials.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{has many}} {{orthopedic}} applications. The material {{is also an}} alternative to PEEK (polyether ether ketone) and titanium, which are used for spinal fusion devices. It is silicon nitride’s <b>hydrophilic,</b> microtextured surface {{that contributes to the}} material's strength, durability and reliability compared to PEEK and titanium.|$|E
5|$|The keto oxygen renders {{mephedrone}} more <b>hydrophilic</b> {{than the}} corresponding methylamphetamines, which {{may account for}} the higher doses required to achieve a similar effect, because mephedrone is less able to cross the blood–brain barrier.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds are {{naturally}} lipophilic and hydrophobic, {{which means the}} diamonds' surface cannot be wet by water, but can be easily wet and stuck by oil. This property can be utilized to extract diamonds using oil when making synthetic diamonds. However, when diamond surfaces are chemically modified with certain ions, {{they are expected to}} become so <b>hydrophilic</b> that they can stabilize multiple layers of water ice at human body temperature.|$|E
5|$|Electroporation is {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in bilayer permeability induced by {{the application of a}} large artificial electric field across the membrane. Experimentally, electroporation is used to introduce <b>hydrophilic</b> molecules into cells. It is a particularly useful technique for large highly charged molecules such as DNA, which would never passively diffuse across the hydrophobic bilayer core. Because of this, electroporation {{is one of the key}} methods of transfection as well as bacterial transformation. It has even been proposed that electroporation resulting from lightning strikes could be a mechanism of natural horizontal gene transfer.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{undergo a}} range of posttranslational modifications, when additional chemical groups {{are attached to the}} amino acids in proteins. Some modifications can produce hydrophobic lipoproteins, or <b>hydrophilic</b> glycoproteins. These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid palmitic acid to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes.|$|E
5|$|Several coleopteran adaptations have {{attracted}} interest in biomimetics with possible commercial applications. The bombardier beetle's powerful repellent spray has inspired {{the development of}} a fine mist spray technology, claimed to have a low carbon impact compared to aerosol sprays. Moisture harvesting behavior by the Namib desert beetle (Stenocara gracilipes) has inspired a self-filling water bottle which utilises <b>hydrophilic</b> and hydrophobic materials to benefit people living in dry regions with no regular rainfall.|$|E
5|$|The {{content of}} water or other solvent {{molecules}} changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into micelles or vesicles. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a <b>hydrophilic</b> (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a <b>hydrophilic</b> surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.|$|E
5|$|The fogstand beetle of the Namib Desert, Stenocara gracilipes, is able {{to collect}} water from fog, as its elytra have a {{textured}} surface combining <b>hydrophilic</b> (water-loving) bumps and waxy, hydrophobic troughs. The beetle faces the early morning breeze, holding up its abdomen; droplets condense on the elytra and run along ridges towards their mouthparts. Similar adaptations are found in several other Namib desert beetles such as Onymacris unguicularis.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of the species grow in moist to wet soils with some growing even in shallow water. They are not very drought resistant, but the species now {{classified}} as Diplacus are. Some species grow in dry areas, others in wet habitats, such {{as members of the}} section Simiolus, which are <b>hydrophilic.</b> Both overall plant size and corolla size vary greatly throughout the genus. A minimum of 25 of the species are listed as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Species are found at elevations from oceanside to high mountains as well as a wide variety of climates, though most prefer wet areas such as riverbanks.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants are {{classified}} into two broad divisions, {{depending on whether}} they are soluble in water (<b>hydrophilic)</b> or in lipids (lipophilic). In general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell cytosol and the blood plasma, while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect cell membranes from lipid peroxidation. These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet. The different antioxidants are present at {{a wide range of}} concentrations in body fluids and tissues, with some such as glutathione or ubiquinone mostly present within cells, while others such as uric acid are more evenly distributed (see table below). Some antioxidants are only found in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in pathogens and can be virulence factors.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{attributes}} {{are sometimes}} mimicked in architecture, {{as at the}} Eastgate Centre, Harare, which uses passive cooling, storing heat {{in the morning and}} releasing it in the warm parts of the day. The target of this piece of biomimicry is the structure of the mounds of termites such as Macrotermes michaelseni which effectively cool the nests of these social insects. The properties of the Namib desert beetle's exoskeleton, in particular its wing-cases (elytra) which have bumps with <b>hydrophilic</b> (water-attracting) tips and hydrophobic (water-shedding) sides, have been mimicked in a film coating designed for the British Ministry of Defence, to capture water in arid regions.|$|E
5|$|Lipids are {{the most}} diverse group of biochemicals. Their main {{structural}} uses are as part of biological membranes both internal and external, such as the cell membrane, or {{as a source of}} energy. Lipids are usually defined as hydrophobic or amphipathic biological molecules but will dissolve in organic solvents such as benzene or chloroform. The fats are a large group of compounds that contain fatty acids and glycerol; a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty acid esters is called a triacylglyceride. Several variations on this basic structure exist, including alternate backbones such as sphingosine in the sphingolipids, and <b>hydrophilic</b> groups such as phosphate as in phospholipids. Steroids such as cholesterol are another major class of lipids.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{acetic acid}} is a <b>hydrophilic</b> (polar) protic solvent, similar to ethanol and water. With a {{moderate}} relative static permittivity (dielectric constant) of 6.2, it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars, but also non-polar compounds such as oils {{as well as}} polar solutes. It is miscible with polar and non-polar solvents such as water, chloroform, and hexane. With higher alkanes (starting with octane), acetic acid is not completely miscible, and its miscibility declines with longer n-alkanes. The solvent and miscibility properties of acetic acid make it a useful industrial chemical, for example, as a solvent {{in the production of}} dimethyl terephthalate.|$|E
5|$|The first {{region on}} either side of the bilayer is the <b>hydrophilic</b> headgroup. This portion of the {{membrane}} is completely hydrated and is typically around 0.8-0.9nm thick. In phospholipid bilayers the phosphate group is located within this hydrated region, approximately 0.5nm outside the hydrophobic core. In some cases, the hydrated region can extend much further, for instance in lipids with a large protein or long sugar chain grafted to the head. One common example of such a modification in nature is the lipopolysaccharide coat on a bacterial outer membrane, which helps retain a water layer around the bacterium to prevent dehydration.|$|E
5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} (or {{phospholipid}} bilayer) {{is a thin}} polar membrane made of two layers of lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell membranes of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, {{even though they are}} only a few nanometers in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (<b>hydrophilic)</b> molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps.|$|E
5|$|To date, {{the most}} {{successful}} commercial application of lipid bilayers has been the use of liposomes for drug delivery, especially for cancer treatment. (Note- the term “liposome” is in essence synonymous with “vesicle” except that vesicle is a general term for the structure whereas liposome refers to only artificial not natural vesicles) The basic idea of liposomal drug delivery is that the drug is encapsulated in solution inside the liposome then injected into the patient. These drug-loaded liposomes travel through the system until they bind at the target site and rupture, releasing the drug. In theory, liposomes should make an ideal drug delivery system since they can isolate nearly any <b>hydrophilic</b> drug, can be grafted with molecules to target specific tissues and can be relatively non-toxic since the body possesses biochemical pathways for degrading lipids.|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide {{nanoparticles}} {{can enhance}} the antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin. It {{has been shown that}} nano ZnO which has the average size between 20nm and 45nm {{can enhance the}} antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in vitro. The enhancing effect of this nanomaterial is concentration dependent against all test strains. This effect may be due to two reasons. First, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with NorA protein, which is developed for conferring resistance in bacteria and has pumping activity that mediate the effluxing of <b>hydrophilic</b> fluoroquinolones from a cell. Second, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with Omf protein, which is responsible for the permeation of quinolone antibiotics into the cell.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Ka, {{which is a}} measure of how much energy is needed to stretch the bilayer, Kb {{is a measure of}} how much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer. Formally, bending modulus is defined as the energy required to deform a membrane from its intrinsic curvature to some other curvature. Intrinsic curvature is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic curvature is nearly zero. If a particular lipid has too large a deviation from zero intrinsic curvature it will not form a bilayer and will instead form other phases such as micelles or inverted micelles. Addition of small <b>hydrophilic</b> molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid lamellar liposomes made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into micellar phase. Typically, Kb is not measured experimentally but rather is calculated from measurements of Ka and bilayer thickness, since the three parameters are related.|$|E
5|$|Metformin has acid {{dissociation}} constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5, so exists very largely as the <b>hydrophilic</b> cationic species at physiological pH values. The metformin pKa values make metformin a stronger base {{than most other}} basic drugs with less than 0.01% nonionized in blood. Furthermore, the lipid solubility of the nonionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value (log(10) of the distribution coefficient of the nonionized form between octanol and water) of -1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and, consequently, rapid passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely. As {{a result of its}} low lipid solubility it requires the transporter SLC22A1 in order for it to enter cells. The logP of metformin is less than that of phenformin (-0.84) because two methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger phenylethyl side chain in phenformin. More lipophilic derivatives of metformin are presently under investigation with the aim of producing prodrugs with superior oral absorption than metformin.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of the lipid bilayer in biology is to {{separate}} aqueous compartments from their surroundings. Without some form of barrier delineating “self” from “non-self,” {{it is difficult to}} even define the concept of an organism or of life. This barrier {{takes the form of a}} lipid bilayer in all known life forms except for a few species of archaea that utilize a specially adapted lipid monolayer. It has even been proposed that the very first form of life may have been a simple lipid vesicle with virtually its sole biosynthetic capability being the production of more phospholipids. The partitioning ability of the lipid bilayer is based on the fact that <b>hydrophilic</b> molecules cannot easily cross the hydrophobic bilayer core, as discussed in Transport across the bilayer below. The nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts have two lipid bilayers, while other sub-cellular structures are surrounded by a single lipid bilayer (such as the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticula, Golgi apparatus and lysosomes). See Organelle.|$|E
25|$|In a {{non-polar}} solvent, it is {{the exposure}} of the <b>hydrophilic</b> head groups to the surrounding solvent that is energetically unfavourable, giving rise to a water-in-oil system. In this case, the <b>hydrophilic</b> groups are sequestered in the micelle core and the hydrophobic groups extend away from the center. These inverse micelles are proportionally less likely to form on increasing headgroup charge, since <b>hydrophilic</b> sequestration would create highly unfavorable electrostatic interactions.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{the nature}} of {{interaction}} between the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium, colloids can be classified as: <b>Hydrophilic</b> colloids: These are water-loving colloids. The colloid particles are attracted toward water. They are also called reversible sols. Hydrophobic colloids: These are opposite in nature to <b>hydrophilic</b> colloids. The colloid particles are repelled by water. They are also called irreversible sols.|$|E
25|$|The {{boundary}} region between the hydrophobic inner core and the <b>hydrophilic</b> interfacial regions is very narrow, at around 3Å, (see lipid bilayer article for {{a description of}} its component chemical groups). Moving outwards away from the hydrophobic core region and into the interfacial <b>hydrophilic</b> region, the effective concentration of water rapidly changes across this boundary layer, from nearly zero to a concentration of around 2 M.|$|E
25|$|Nadolol is {{a mixture}} of stereoisomers. It is polar and <b>hydrophilic,</b> with low lipid solubility.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen-containing {{compounds}} – Are typically <b>hydrophilic</b> and polar, including {{materials such}} as silica gel and zeolites.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol {{prefers to}} bond in the <b>hydrophilic</b> region near {{phosphate}} groups {{which could be}} contributed to its amphiphilic character.|$|E
25|$|MD {{calculations}} {{coupled with}} Hamiltonian-biasing algorithms {{have been used}} to probe the encapsulation thermodynamics of DNA double-strands onto hydrophobic and <b>hydrophilic</b> single-walled carbon nanotubes.|$|E
25|$|The gas, being {{strongly}} <b>hydrophilic,</b> can {{be easily}} scrubbed from the exhaust gases of a reaction by bubbling it through water, producing useful hydrochloric acid as a byproduct.|$|E
25|$|Acrylic paint {{essentially}} {{consists of}} PMMA suspended in water; however since PMMA is hydrophobic, a substance with both hydrophobic and <b>hydrophilic</b> groups {{needs to be}} added to facilitate the suspension.|$|E
25|$|Arginine's {{side chain}} is amphipathic, because at {{physiological}} pH {{it contains a}} positively charged guanidinium group, which is highly polar, {{at the end of}} a hydrophobic aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. Because globular proteins have hydrophobic interiors and <b>hydrophilic</b> surfaces, arginine is typically found on the outside of the protein, where the <b>hydrophilic</b> head group can interact with the polar environment, for example taking part in hydrogen bonding and salt bridges. For this reason, it is frequently found at the interface between two proteins. The aliphatic part of the side chain sometimes remains below the surface of the protein.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{hard contact}} lenses were {{frequently}} made of this material. Soft contact lenses are often {{made of a}} related polymer, where acrylate monomers containing one or more hydroxyl groups make them <b>hydrophilic.</b>|$|E
25|$|NS5A is a <b>hydrophilic</b> phosphoprotein {{which plays}} an {{important}} role in viral replication, modulation of cell signaling pathways and the interferon response. It is known to bind to endoplasmic reticulum anchored human VAP proteins.|$|E
