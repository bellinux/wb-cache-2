2500|$|It {{was also}} {{confirmed}} that the bare-legged owl was distinct enough to warrant separation in its own genus. [...] The Puerto Rican <b>screech</b> <b>owl,</b> however, is just a slightly aberrant Megascops. Furthermore, the white-throated <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> was recognized {{as part of an}} ancient lineage of Megascops – including also the whiskered <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> and the tropical <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> which previously were considered to be of unclear relationships – and indeed its call structure is not too dissimilar from the latter. Its distinct coloration, approximated in the southern whiskered <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> (Megascops trichopsis mesamericanus), is thus likely the result of strong genetic drift.|$|R
40|$|The poorly known Cloud-forest <b>Screech</b> <b>Owl</b> (Megascops marshalli) is a Peruvian endemic {{known from}} only two localities, and its vocalizations {{have not been}} documented. We report the first Bolivian {{specimen}} and sound-recordings, {{an analysis of the}} species' longsong in comparison with other brown-eyed Andean <b>screech</b> <b>owls,</b> and discuss its distribution, natural history, ecological relationships with sympatric congeners, and conservation status. Longsongs were most {{similar to those of the}} allopatric Cinnamon <b>Screech</b> <b>Owl</b> (M. petersoni) in northern Peru and Ecuador. Principal component analysis of four vocal characters identified: (1) notable overlap between the two species; (2) some overlap of the Cloud-forest <b>Screech</b> <b>Owl</b> with Ecuadorian, but not with sympatric Bolivian populations of the Rufescent <b>Screech</b> <b>Owl</b> (M. ingens); and (3) considerable, evidently clinal geographic variation in the Rufescent <b>Screech</b> <b>Owl.</b> Divergence in vocal characteristics between the Cloud-forest <b>Screech</b> <b>Owl</b> in Bolivia and other species decreased with increasing geographic distance. The Cloud-forest <b>Screech</b> <b>Owl</b> is now known from six localities from Departamento Pasco, Peru, south to Departamento Cochabamba, Bolivia, and has a disjunct distribution with four subpopulations and an overall extent of occurrence of 12, 700 km 2. Its preferred habitat is pristine to at most slightly disturbed wet montane forest with high structural complexity, dense understory, and abundant epiphytes. It has been recorded at altitudes of 1, 550 – 2, 580 m, but locally its altitudinal range is 500 m, where it is narrowly syntopic with Rufescent <b>Screech</b> <b>Owl</b> at its lower and White-throated <b>Screech</b> <b>Owl</b> (M. albogularis) at its upper terminus. Narrowly overlapping altitudinal replacement in Andean Megascops taxa combined with variable location of replacement zones depending on local ecoclimatic conditions suggest that species' distributions are primarily maintained by exclusion via interspecific competition. The Cloud-forest <b>Screech</b> <b>Owl</b> is currently properly listed as Near Threatened, but further research may show it is more appropriately categorized as Vulnerable. Sebastian K.

50|$|The Western <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> (Megascops kennicottii) {{is a small}} owl {{native to}} North and Central America, {{closely related to the}} European scops owl and the North American eastern <b>screech</b> <b>owl.</b> The {{scientific}} name commemorates the American naturalist Robert Kennicott.|$|R
50|$|While eastern <b>screech</b> <b>owls</b> {{have lived}} for over 20 years in captivity, wild birds seldom, if ever, live that long. Mortality rates of young and {{nestling}} owls {{may be as}} high as 70% (usually significantly less in adult <b>screech</b> <b>owls).</b> Many losses are due to predation. Common predators at <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> nests including Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), American minks (Neovison vison), weasels (Mustela ssp.), raccoons (Procyon lotor), ringtails (Bassariscus astutus), skunks, snakes, crows (Corvus ssp.), and blue jays. Eastern fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) may raid the tree holes being used by eastern <b>screech</b> <b>owls,</b> not only destroying or consuming the eggs but also displacing the adult owls from the hole to use the hole for themselves. Adults have fewer predators but larger species of owl do take them, since they have similar periods of activity. Larger owls known to have preyed on eastern <b>screech</b> <b>owls</b> have included great horned owls, barred owls (Strix varia), spotted owls (Strix occidentalis), long-eared owls (Asio otus), short-eared owls (Asio flammeus) and snowy owls (Bubo scandianus). Diurnal birds of prey may also kill and eat them, including Cooper's hawks (Accipiter cooperii), northern harriers (Circus cyaenus), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaciensis), red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus) and rough-legged hawks (Buteo lagopus). Most prolific by far of the eastern <b>screech</b> <b>owl's</b> avian predators is the great horned owl, which can destroy up to 78% of a local population, but locally Cooper's hawks and barred owls are almost as serious of a threat. A most dramatic case illustrating the owl food chain involved a barred owl, which up examination after being shot in New England contained a long-eared owl in its stomach that, in its own stomach, contained an eastern <b>screech</b> <b>owl.</b> All other common owls in this species range also live off of similar rodent prey but direct competition is obviously disadvantageous to the <b>screech</b> <b>owl.</b> One exception is the even smaller northern saw-whet owl, on which eastern <b>screech</b> <b>owls</b> have been known to prey. In rural Michigan, 9 different species of owl and diurnal raptor including the <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> fed primarily on the same four species of small rodent from the Peromyscus and Microtus genera. Eastern <b>screech</b> <b>owls</b> have had nesting attempts fail due to biocide poisoning, which causes the thinning of eggs and failure of nests, but seemingly not to the overall detriment of the species. Collisions with cars, trains and windowpanes kill many <b>screech</b> <b>owls,</b> the earlier especially while feeding on road-side rodents and road-kills.|$|R
50|$|The black-capped <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> (Megascops atricapilla), or {{variable}} <b>screech</b> <b>owl,</b> is {{a species of}} owl in the family Strigidae.It is found in Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay.Its natural habitats are temperate forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, and heavily degraded former forest.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{closely related}} western <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> (Megascops kennicottii), {{there are not}} [...] "morphs", as all owls of the western species are gray. Besides coloration, the western <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> is of {{almost exactly the same}} general {{appearance}} and size as the eastern. The only reliable distinguishing features are the bill color, which is considerably darker (often a black-gray) in the western and olive-yellow in the eastern, and their different voices. The eastern and western <b>screech</b> <b>owls</b> overlap in the range in the Rio Grande valley at the Texas-Mexico border and the riparian woods of the Cimarron tributary of the Arkansas River on the edge of southern Great Plains. Other somewhat similar species that may abut the eastern <b>screech</b> <b>owl's</b> range in its western and southernmost distribution, like the Middle American <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> (Megascops guatemalae; formerly called [...] "vermiculated screech owl"), whiskered <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> (Megascops trichopsis) and the flammulated owl (Psiloscops flammeolus), are distinguished by their increasingly smaller body and foot size, different streaking pattern on breast (bolder on the whiskered, weaker on the others), different bare part coloration, and distinctive voices. Through much of the eastern United States, eastern <b>screech</b> <b>owls</b> are essentially physically unmistakable, because other owls with ear tufts are much larger and different colored and the only other small owl, the northern saw-whet owl (Aegolius acadius) is even smaller, with no ear tufts, a more defined facial disc, and browner overall color.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century, it was {{becoming}} clear that Otus encompassed more than one genus. First, in 1848, the <b>screech</b> <b>owls</b> were split off as Megascops.

2500|$|The {{evolutionary}} relationships [...] of the scops and <b>screech</b> <b>owls</b> are {{not entirely}} clear. What is certain {{is that they are}} very closely related; they may be considered sister lineages which fill essentially the same ecological niche in their allopatric ranges. A <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> fossil from the Late Pliocene of Kansas (which is almost identical to eastern and western <b>screech</b> <b>owls)</b> indicates a longstanding presence of these birds in the Americas, while coeval scops owl fossils very similar to the Eurasian scops owl have been found at S'Onix on Majorca. The scops and <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> lineage probably evolved at some time during the Miocene (like most other genera of typical owls), and the three (see below) modern lineages separated perhaps roughly 5 million years ago. Note that there is no reliable estimate of divergence time, as Otus and Megascops are osteologically very similar, as is to be expected from a group that has apparently conserved its ecomorphology since before its evolutionary radiation. Like almost all scops and <b>screech</b> <b>owls</b> today, their common ancestor was in all probability already a small owl, with ear tufts and at least the upper tarsus ("leg") feathered.|$|R

Tropical <b>Screech</b> <b>Owl</b> occurs in scrubland and wooded habitats, whereas the Burrowing Owl inhabits open grasslands to grassland savannah. Sixteen survey points were systematically distributed in four different landscape types, ranging from open grassland to woodland savannah.
