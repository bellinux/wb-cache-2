5|$|Certain {{species such}} as Gnathamitermes tubiformans have {{seasonal}} food habits. For example, they may preferentially consume Red three-awn (Aristida longiseta) during the summer, Buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides) from May to August, and blue grama Bouteloua gracilis during spring, summer and autumn. Colonies of G.tubiformans consume less food in spring than they <b>do</b> <b>during</b> autumn when their feeding activity is high.|$|E
5|$|Many LARPs have game {{rules that}} {{determine}} how characters can affect {{each other and}} the setting. The rules may be defined in a publication or created by the gamemasters. These rules may define characters' capabilities, what can be done with various objects that exist in the setting, and what characters can <b>do</b> <b>during</b> the downtime between LARP events. Because referees are often not available to mediate all character actions, players are relied upon to be honest in their application of the rules.|$|E

They took their traditional on-orbit crew portrait, and spoke with reporters from around the world in a news conference. The crew also had the opportunity to speak with the Expedition 19 crew on board the International Space Station, in a conference call routed through satellites.

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, many East Germans cut the coat of arms out of their flags, as Hungarians had done in 1956 and as Romanians would soon <b>do</b> <b>during</b> {{the fall of}} Ceaușescu. The {{widespread}} act of removing the coat of arms from the East German flag implied the plain black-red-gold tricolour as symbol for a united and democratic Germany. Finally, on 3 October 1990, as the area of the German Democratic Republic was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany, the black-red-gold tricolour became the flag of a reunified Germany. In 1998, the Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship was formed. The duty of this organisation, directly responsible to the federal government, is to examine the consequences of the former East German regime. As its logo, the foundation used an East German flag with the Communist coat of arms cut out.|$|E
5|$|Jim's plan {{to drive}} home from Philadelphia to see his {{daughter}} CeCe's ballet recital hits a snag when a major investor says he is backing out. Jim asks his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to record the recital with her phone, which she agrees to <b>do.</b> <b>During</b> {{the opening of the}} recital, she stops recording to take a phone call informing her that she has been chosen to paint an important public mural. In her excitement, she messes up the recording and fails to record any of CeCe's appearance. Jim calls her that evening to tell her the investor backed out, and his group will have to work long hours to make up the lost funds. He asks her to send him her recording of the recital as a way to cheer him up, and Pam confesses that she did not tape it. She tries to make light of the mishap by making self-deprecating remarks and pointing out that they can get recordings of the recital from other attendees, but he becomes frustrated at her, scolding her and starting a fight over his new job, the time he spends away from the family, and the sacrifices they are making to get their new life to work. After he hangs up, Pam breaks down in tears. A previously unseen boom operator named Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos) enters into the shot and comforts her, and tells the crew to stop filming.|$|E

The U.S. government's rule ended in October 1922, and elections were held in March 1924.|$|E
25|$|Gregory also {{mandated}} {{a number}} of practices within the Church. He decreed that in Lent, on the Thursdays, people should fast, {{just as they were}} required to <b>do</b> <b>during</b> the other days of the week. Apparently the practice had been frowned upon by popes of previous centuries, as pagans had fasted on Thursday as part of their worship of Jupiter. He also prescribed the offices to be said during church services on Thursdays in Lent, as prior to this, the Mass of the preceding Sunday was said on those Thursdays.|$|E

25|$|Richardson had {{advocated}} {{the use of}} the Police on motorbikes in the mid 1930s because of their speed and maneuverability. When the Second World War started he increased the number to at least six. The motor bikes had sidecars attached and were equipped with gas masks and tin helmets. In January 1940 Alfred Richardson issued a booklet for animal owners in Halifax. It listed what animal owners should <b>do</b> <b>during</b> the expected blitz. 11 civilians were killed and 10 injured when a bomb dropped on Hanson Lane, Halifax on 22 November 1940. Ten other local bombing incidents occurred between June 1940 and December 1944. There was a total of 588 casualties in Halifax in the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Gear sets may be {{replaced}} with closer ratios to keep the engine in the power band, or, on some cars that produce enough power and torque to four-gear transmissions {{similar to the ones}} used in NASCAR (such as the Andrews four-speed dog box that Vaughn Gittin Jr. ran in his 2016 Mustang) with more open-ratio gears, this limits the number of shifts the driver has to <b>do</b> <b>during</b> their run. These may be coarser dog engagement straight cut gears instead of synchronised helical gears, for durability and faster shifting at the expense of noise and refinement. Wealthier drifters may use sequential gearboxes to make gear selection easier and faster, while sequential shift lever adapters {{can be used to make}} shifts easier without increasing shift time.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd's second {{stint in}} WCW {{was when he}} was booked to be {{defeated}} by The Great Muta at a house show in Atlanta. Following that match, at Muta's request, Lloyd joined Muta on a string of WCW house shows before he moved to Japan in 1993. He joined the UWFI as a guest of shootfighter Nobuhiko Takada, and competed against Japanese and American fighters. Lloyd returned to the United States after UWFI folded in 1996, and during a conversation with friend Diamond Dallas Page, he mentioned that he was planning to integrate martial arts into his wrestling, which he had been unable to <b>do</b> <b>during</b> the early days of his career. At Page's request, WCW president Eric Bischoff, a martial arts practitioner himself, met with Lloyd for three hours and signed him to a contract.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the nature}} of their work 1 ACAU {{personnel}} were quite vulnerable to enemy action and potentially could have suffered heavy casualties if the Viet Cong had decided to target them. Many members spent time alone in villages while civil affairs vehicles often traveled routes with just a driver and one passenger. Yet overall, there was little hostile action against members of the unit. In the early days after the unit's arrival in Nui Dat, there were sniper incidents in Hoa Long, and a medical team became involved in a contact in Hoi My, south of Dat <b>Do,</b> <b>during</b> which several 1 ACAU members sustained minor gunshot wounds. There were other minor incidents later also, for example, when the Viet Cong destroyed the water reticulation system on Long Son island, just days after it came into operation. However, by 1969–70 the security situation in the province had greatly improved.|$|E
25|$|This {{election}} {{is the last}} election - presidential, local and general - scheduled in Turkey until 2019. Arguments as to whether this is by chance, {{or whether it was}} planned by the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government when they proposed to reduce the parliamentary terms from five years to four in the 2007 constitutional referendum, are still ongoing. Speculation as to what the AKP government will <b>do</b> <b>during</b> four years of electorally unchecked power should they win generated both favourable predictions and concerns. While four years without elections may allow the government to undertake widespread necessary economic reforms, critics of the AKP argue that it is an opportunity to further erode the diminishing checks and balances and separation of powers in the Turkish political and legal systems. The AKP also support a presidential system, which would give greater powers to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.|$|E
25|$|Before {{understanding}} Aristotle's {{views on}} dreams, first {{his idea of}} sleep must be examined. Aristotle gives an account of his explanation of sleep in On Sleep and Wakefulness. Sleep takes place {{as a result of}} overuse of the senses or of digestion, so it is vital to the body, including the senses, so it can be revitalized. While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they <b>do</b> <b>during</b> wakefulness. Since a person cannot sense during sleep they can also not have a desire, which {{is the result of a}} sensation. However, the senses are able to work during sleep, albeit differently than when a person is awake because during sleep a person can still have sensory experiences. Also, not all of the senses are inactive during sleep, only the ones that are weary.|$|E

25|$|Rolf {{served on}} Murray's {{transition}} team following his successful bid for Mayor of Seattle in 2013, {{and was named}} co-chair of the 23-person Income Inequality Advisory Committee, which addresses minimum wage and other social issues. In late December 2013, Murray announced plans to increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour, which he had pledged to <b>do</b> <b>during</b> his election campaign, earning him an endorsement from Local 775 of SEIU. Simultaneously, Rolf was working alongside newly elected Seattle City Council member Kshama Sawant, who had also advocated for a $15-per-hour minimum wage, to bring the issue into the mainstream and attract support for the policy from both Seattle Mayors Michael McGinn and Murray. Both politicians sought to earn the support of Rolf and Local 775 of SEIU {{in order to bring}} their agendas to fruition. The Income Inequality Advisory Committee was scheduled to make a recommendation by April 30, 2014, allowing Murray the ability to submit a proposal to City Council by the end of July.|$|E
25|$|Once La Rue {{was engaged}} with the Grande chapelle, he made two trips to Spain. On the second trip, in 1506, he was shipwrecked in the English Channel, and spent three {{months at the}} court of Henry VII of England. After two more years in Spain, {{in the service of}} Juana of Castile – Joanna the Mad – he {{returned}} to the Netherlands in 1508, probably because Juana had been forced out of power (her husband, Philip, had died of typhus in 1506). Juana was inconsolable, unable to leave the corpse of her dead husband, and had become quite insane; why La Rue stayed as long as he did is not known, but it is not impossible that his dark, intensely expressive music {{was one of the few}} things that brought her solace. In addition, he was treated well. Juana promoted him to premier chapelain, the head of the chapel, and paid him twice what the other singers received; paying the singers was apparently the one of the only practical administrative matters she was able to <b>do</b> <b>during</b> the period of her madness.|$|E
25|$|Vassar confers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) {{degree in}} more than 50 majors, {{including}} the Independent Major, in which a student may design a major, as well as various interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary fields of study. Students also participate in such programs as the Self-Instructional Language Program (SILP) which offers courses in Hindi, Irish/Gaelic, Korean, Portuguese, Swahili, Swedish, Turkish, and Yiddish. Vassar has a flexible curriculum intended to promote breadth in studies. While each field of study has specific requirements for majors, the only universal requirements for graduation are proficiency in a foreign language, a quantitative course, and a freshman writing course. Students are also strongly encouraged to study abroad, which they typically <b>do</b> <b>during</b> one or two semesters of their junior year. Students (usually juniors) may apply {{for a year or}} a semester away either in the U.S. or abroad. Vassar sponsors programs in China, England, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Turkey, Mexico, Morocco, Spain, and Russia; students may also join preapproved programs offered by other colleges. Students may also apply for approved programs at various U.S. institutions, including the historically Black colleges and members of the Twelve College Exchange.|$|E
