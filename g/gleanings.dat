5|$|In 1866, {{at the age}} of 29, {{he became}} a fellow of the Linnean Society under the {{sponsorship}} of Charles Darwin, James Veitch, David Moore, and seven other distinguished botanists and horticulturists. Two months later, he left Regents Park to write for The Gardener's Chronicle and The Times, and represented the leading horticultural firm of Veitch at the 1867 Paris Exhibition. He began writing many of his publications, beginning with <b>Gleanings</b> from French Gardens in 1868, The Parks, Gardens, and Promenades of Paris in 1869, and Alpine Flowers for Gardens and The Wild Garden in 1870. In 1871 he launched his own gardening journal, simply named , which over the years included contributions from notables such as John Ruskin, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Gertrude Jekyll, William Morris, Dean Hole, Canon Ellacombe, and James Britten.|$|E
5|$|The {{books and}} letters written by Bahá'u'lláh cover {{religious}} doctrine, the proclamation of his claims, {{social and moral}} teachings as well as Bahá'í laws; he also wrote many prayers. Jináb-i-Fádil-i-Mázindarání, analyzing Baha'u'llah's writings, states that {{he wrote in the}} different styles or categories including the interpretation of religious scripture, the enunciation of laws and ordinances, mystical writings, writings about government and world order, including letters to the kings and rulers of the world, writings about knowledge, philosophy, medicine, and alchemy, writings calling for education, good character and virtues, and writing about social teachings. All of his works are considered by Bahá'ís to be revelation, even those that were written before his announcement of his prophetic claim. Some of his better known works that have been translated into English include <b>Gleanings,</b> the Hidden Words, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the Kitáb-i-Íqán.|$|E
5|$|The widowed Vernal {{remarried}} to Catherine Davis Goodall in 1849, but trusteeship of Virginia Thorne, by now a teenager, {{remained with}} Margaret. With {{most of his}} time spent in the nation's capital, Houston's perception of Thorne was primarily second-hand <b>gleanings</b> from Margaret's letters; yet, he disliked and distrusted the orphaned girl {{to the point where he}} feared for the health and safety of his children with her in the house. Exacerbating the situation was Margaret's disapproval of the relationship that the teenage girl developed with overseer Thomas Gott. Push literally came to shove during an incident in which Margaret disciplined her for what she believed was rough handling of one of the children. Thorne alleged that during the ensuing dispute over the situation, Margaret had used threats and physical violence against her. After she eloped with Gott a month later, the couple filed assault and battery charges against Margaret. When a grand jury investigation resulted in a deadlock, the matter was referred to the local Baptist church that Margaret helped found, and she was acquitted of the charges. Houston came to believe that the filing of legal charges against his wife had been encouraged by his political enemies.|$|E
50|$|In 1985 the Society of St. Andrew {{launched}} Harvest of Hope, a <b>gleaning</b> {{and study}} camp for youth. The first event {{was held at}} Camp Occahannock-on-the-Bay, on Virginia’s Eastern Shore, and was led by Rev. Rhonda VanDyke Colby. A major component of Harvest of Hope is field <b>gleaning.</b> As {{more and more people}} became exposed to <b>gleaning,</b> they wanted to introduce it to their own churches. As a result, the <b>Gleaning</b> Network was established in Virginia in 1988. Since then, <b>gleaning</b> has expanded dramatically.|$|R

5000|$|The court {{sided with}} landlords and found against the gleaners' claims, rejecting {{arguments}} from Mosaic Law {{and from the}} traditional Anglo-Saxon constitution {{as a basis for}} the common law. [...] Although precedent was raised by the gleaners that appeared to support <b>gleaning,</b> the court held that this was only to be viewed in the narrowest of terms with conditions, as was legislation which had provision for <b>gleaning</b> (the sections that were discussed dealt only with penalties). The Court held <b>gleaning</b> to be only a ‘privilege’ and not a right; the poor of a parish had no legal right to glean, hence <b>gleaning</b> was trespass.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gleaning</b> is {{the act of}} {{collecting}} leftover crops from farmers' fields {{after they have been}} commercially harvested or from fields where it is not economically profitable to harvest. Some ancient cultures promoted <b>gleaning</b> as an early form of a welfare system. In the Soviet Union, people who gleaned and distributed food brought themselves under legal risk. The Law of Spikelets criminalised <b>gleaning</b> under penalty of death, or ten years of forced labour in exceptional circumstances.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine how the <b>gleaning</b> network in Vermont {{functions}} as part of a movement towards disrupting the waste stream, improving food security and individual empowerment, and creating a sustainable food system. <b>Gleaning</b> is the volunteer-based practice of recapturing usable but not sellable food from fields post-harvest. In Vermont, as in other states, this food is then used to improve food access for marginalized populations. Using community-based research methods with the non-profit organization Salvation Farms, this study examines how <b>gleaning</b> in Vermont creates networks between farmers and consumers and how it connects institutions to local farmers. It explains how <b>gleaning</b> shapes people’s perceptions of their food system, how it creates and defines community, and what we can learn about increasing personal investment in the Vermont food system. This thesis will also assess <b>gleaning’s</b> ability to help create more resilience within the food system overall. The practice of <b>gleaning</b> will be demonstrated to be a highly effective tool to create community and interpersonal ties; this will be done through Bourdieu’s theories on social capital and a comprehensive examination of social capital’s role in the food system...|$|R
40|$|For over 25 years {{organized}} {{groups of}} low-income families in Oregon have been gathering food {{that would otherwise}} go to waste and distributing this food among organization members.

Data was collected through participant observation at a regional food distribution agency and seven <b>gleaning</b> group sites, as well as interviews with 13 key informants working with <b>gleaning</b> organizations, and 19 volunteer members of <b>gleaning</b> organizations.

25|$|Much of Stuart's {{writing is}} still in the form of {{unpublished}} memoirs and letters, mostly addressed to women, but interest in her as an observer of her times began to increase {{towards the end of the}} nineteenth century. Between 1895 and 1898, Mrs Godfrey Clark edited and published three volumes of Stuart's work called <b>Gleanings</b> from an Old Portfolio (Correspondence of Lady Louisa Stuart), and the Hon. James A.

25|$|Lectures that Dōgen gave to his monks at his monastery, Eihei-ji, were {{compiled}} {{under the title}} Eihei Kōroku, also known as Dōgen Oshō Kōroku (The Extensive Record of Teacher Dōgen’s Sayings) in ten volumes. The sermons, lectures, sayings and poetry {{were compiled}} shortly after Dōgen’s death by his main disciples, Koun Ejō (孤雲懐奘, 1198–1280), Senne and Gien. There are three different editions of this text: the Rinnō-ji text from 1598; a popular version printed in 1672 and a version discovered at Eihei-ji in 1937 which, although undated, {{is believed to be}} the oldest extant version. Another collection of his talks is the Shōbōgenzō Zuimonki (<b>Gleanings</b> from Master Dōgen’s Sayings) in six volumes. These are talks that Dōgen gave to his leading disciple, Ejō, who became Dōgen’s disciple in 1234. The talks were recorded and edited by Ejō.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} and summer, the migratory populations of the red-crowned crane breed in Siberia (eastern Russia), northeastern China and {{occasionally}} in northeastern Mongolia (i.e., Mongol Daguur Strictly Protected Area). The breeding range centers in Lake Khanka, {{on the border of}} China and Russia. Normally, the crane lays two eggs, with only one surviving. Later, in the fall, they migrate in flocks to Korea and east-central China to spend the winter. Vagrants have also been recorded in Taiwan, China. In addition to the migratory populations, a resident population is found in eastern Hokkaidō in Japan. This species nests in wetlands and rivers. In the wintering range, their habitat is comprised mainly by paddy fields, grassy tidal flats, and mudflats. In the flats, the birds feed on aquatic invertebrates and, in cold, snowy conditions, the birds switch to mainly living on rice <b>gleanings</b> from the paddy fields.|$|E

50|$|In {{the modern}} world, <b>gleaning</b> is practised by {{humanitarian}} groups which distribute the gleaned {{food to the}} poor and hungry; in a modern context, this can include the collection of food from supermarkets {{at the end of the}} day that would otherwise be thrown away.

40|$|The Heartside <b>Gleaning</b> Initiative Project, {{founded by}} Grand Valley {{professor}} Lisa Sisson, has made incredible strides in its mere one season of operation. The project gathers unsold produce {{from the two}} local Grand Rapids farmers markets, and brings it to lower-income residents of the Heartside Neighborhood of the city. These residents don’t have access to this bounty of produce regularly, and the <b>Gleaning</b> Initiative Project has made the possibility of regularly having such fruits and vegetables more of a reality. While this project has undeniably made great waves of progress in the well-being and nutrition of the Heartside Neighborhood, one primary issue {{is that many of}} the recipients don’t have substantial experience in cooking with a wide array of vegetables. The goal of the <b>Gleaning</b> Workshop Project is to provide the residents of the Heartside Neighborhood with a basis of techniques, tips, and practices to aid them in preparing the produce they receive from the <b>Gleaning</b> Initiative Project. The <b>Gleaning</b> Workshop’s plan is to conduct eight workshops per year, each focusing on a different aspect of nutrition and food preparation. Our hope is to develop a well-balanced curriculum of workshops, that will both aid and inspire the recipients of <b>Gleaning</b> Initiative produce in making healthy and delicious food choices...|$|R
25|$|In {{classical}} rabbinical literature, it {{was argued}} that the Biblical regulations concerning left-overs only applied to corn fields, orchards, and vineyards, and not to vegetable gardens; the classical rabbinical writers were much stricter in regard to who could receive the remains. It was stated that the farmer was not permitted {{to benefit from the}} <b>gleanings,</b> and was not permitted to discriminate among the poor, nor try to frighten them away with dogs or lions (Hullin 131a, Pe'ah 5:6) the farmer was not even allowed to help one of the poor to gather the left-overs. However, it was also {{argued that the}} law was only applicable in Canaan, (Jerusalem Talmud. Pe'ah 2:5) although many classical rabbinical writers who were based in Babylon observed the laws there (Hullin 134b) it was also seen as only applying to Jewish paupers, but poor non-Jews were allowed to benefit for the sake of civil peace (Gittin 59b).|$|E
25|$|Not {{all that}} remains is bone. There may be melted metal lumps from missed jewellery; casket furniture; dental fillings; and {{surgical}} implants, such as hip replacements. Breast implants {{do not have to}} be removed before cremation. Large items such as titanium hip replacements (which tarnish but do not melt) or casket hinges are usually removed before processing, as they may damage the processor. (If they are missed at first, they must ultimately be removed before processing is complete, as items such as titanium joint replacements are far too durable to be ground). Implants may be returned to the family, but are more commonly sold as ferrous/non-ferrous scrap metal. After the remains are processed, smaller bits of metal such as tooth fillings, and rings (commonly known as <b>gleanings)</b> are sieved out and may be later interred in common, consecrated ground in a remote area of the cemetery. They may also be sold as precious metal scrap.|$|E
25|$|In October 1953 Marie Ciocca {{moved to}} Cagliari in Sardinia and was {{appointed}} by Shoghi Effendi as a Knight of Bahá'u'lláh - Ciocca was an Italian-American and soon married James Holmlund who had also moved to Sardinia from America.

In 1968 there was a public meeting in Sardinia which was also the subject of the local newspaper article. In November 1975 the local assembly of Cagliari held a booth at a 10-day fair on Sardinia as well as an observation of United Nations Day. In November 1975 a television talk program called Ore Venti out of Cagliari reviewed the religion. The interviewer opened the program with a reading from <b>Gleanings</b> from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh. Alessandro Bausani then spoke {{of the history of the}} religion and explained Bahá'í administration. Another guest, Manuela Fanti, explained how and why she joined the religion. During the 25-minute interview Bausani stressed the universality of the religion by describing his recent trip to Bolivia. By summer 1976 Bahá'ís had been invited to address a number of religious studies classes in Cagliari and Alessandria, hour-long interviews had been granted on two Cagliari radio stations and an assembly was formed in Quartu Sant'Elena. In 1978 the Bahá'ís of Cagliari and Quartu Sant'Elena pooled resources to support a booth at the Trade Fair in 1978.|$|E
