5|$|A promotional limited comic {{series was}} {{produced}} in the run up to the game's release. The comic was written by Robbie Morrison, and drawn by Sergio Sandoval and Trevor Hairsine. The cover art was handled by Murry, while both McMarle and Jacques-Belletête took supervisory roles <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> and artwork respectively. The comic was published by DC Comics between February 9 and June 20, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Burne-Jones's {{paintings}} were one strand in the evolving tapestry of Aestheticism from the 1860s through the 1880s, which considered that art should be valued {{as an object}} of beauty engendering a sensual response, rather than <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> or moral implicit in the subject matter. In many ways this was antithetical to the ideals of Ruskin and the early Pre-Raphaelites.|$|E

She won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for Klute and another in 1978 for Coming Home as well as another Academy Award for Best Actress in 1978, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of a {{disabled}} Vietnam War veteran's difficulty in re-entering civilian life.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{this series}} of events is {{extremely}} improbable. Constantius had already left Helena {{by the time he}} left for Britain. Additionally, no earlier source mentions that Helena was born in Britain, let alone that she was a princess. Henry's source <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> is unknown, though {{it may have been a}} lost hagiography of Helena.|$|E
5|$|In late 1968 {{the book}} En mann kalt Gulosten was released, written by Bjørn Bjørnsen. Already before {{the book was}} released, film rights <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> were bought by the company Teamfilm. Teamfilm {{employee}} Knut Bohwim stated that the book contained enough material for three motion pictures, but that they would concentrate the story into one film at best.|$|E

5|$|The museum's director, Professor Capart, {{exhibited}} similarities with Professor Tarragon, a new {{character that}} Hergé had developed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> He {{also included a}} number of characters who had previously appeared in earlier adventures, among them Professor Cantonneau from The Shooting Star, General Alcazar from The Broken Ear, and Bianca Castafiore from King Ottokar's Sceptre.|$|E
5|$|The one-sided {{relationship}} has been discussed in many books. Some question the accuracy of Kubizek's memoir, the only source <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> Others accept {{that there is some}} basis of fact, but downplay the significance of the youthful infatuation, while yet others consider that it gives valuable insight into the development of Hitler's personality.|$|E
5|$|Upon his death, Hergé left {{around one}} hundred and fifty pages of pencil {{sketches}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> The story itself had no ending, and is left on a cliffhanger, with Tintin's fate left unexplained.|$|E

5|$|After the {{completion}} of the film's 175-day run, novelist S. P. Chary accused the film of being based on a novel that he had written and published as a serial under the title Chanderi in a monthly magazine in 1998. He demanded that filmmakers compensate him for using his idea without consent, and threatened to take legal action if the producers did not heed his demands, or remade the film in another language. He added that he deserved to be credited <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> and alleged that Allu Arjun and Allu Sirish were trying to postpone his acknowledgment by discussing the issue with him.|$|E
5|$|Another {{much earlier}} Puranic {{character}} associated with Kerala is Mahabali, an Asura and a prototypical just king, who ruled the earth from Kerala. He {{won the war}} against the Devas, driving them into exile. The Devas pleaded before Lord Vishnu, who took his fifth incarnation as Vamana and pushed Mahabali down to Patala (the netherworld) to placate the Devas. There is a belief that, once a year during the Onam festival, Mahabali returns to Kerala. The Matsya Purana, among the oldest of the 18 Puranas, uses the Malaya Mountains of Kerala (and Tamil Nadu) as the setting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of Matsya, the first incarnation of Vishnu, and Manu, the first man and the king of the region.|$|E
5|$|By 1936 {{there was}} already a demand for reprints of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with Lesne sending a letter to Hergé enquiring if this was possible. The {{cartoonist}} was reluctant, stating that the original plates <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> were now in a poor condition and {{that as a result}} he would have to redraw the entire story were it to be re-published. Several years later, amid the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, a German-run publishing company asked Hergé for permission to republish Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with the intent of using it as anti-Soviet propaganda, but again Hergé declined the offer.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{the game}} began after Uchikoshi joined Chunsoft to write a visual novel for them that could reach a wider audience; Uchikoshi {{suggested}} adding puzzle elements that are integrated with the game's story. The inspiration <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> was {{the question of where}} inspiration comes from; while researching it, Uchikoshi came across Rupert Sheldrake's morphic resonance hypothesis, which became the main theme {{of the game}}. The music was composed by Shinji Hosoe, while the characters were designed by Kinu Nishimura. The localization was handled by Aksys Games; they worked by the philosophy of keeping true to the spirit of the original Japanese version, opting for natural-sounding English rather than following the original's exact wording.|$|E
5|$|Digital Devil Saga began {{development}} pre-2002 under the working title New Goddess. The game's concept and original draft {{were written by}} Japanese author Yu Godai, but she withdrew from the project for personal reasons, {{and was replaced by}} Atlus scriptwriter Tadashi Satomi. The gameplay concept of the characters transforming into demons was based on an unused idea for Shin Megami Tensei. The second game {{began development}} immediately after the first, with the main development effort going into refining and improving the gameplay. While their commercial performances varied, both games were praised by critics for their story, graphics and gameplay. Since release, the game has inspired a mobile prequel, and Godai wrote a series of novels based on her original premise <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2s {{story is}} brought out via {{narrative}} pre-rendered cutscenes, the pre- and post-mission briefings, {{as well as}} in-game chatter between non-player characters, and scripted mission events. The structure <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> is linear without any branching paths for alternate storylines, though there are optional covert missions which can further flesh out the story. The story can only be continued by clearing missions and progressing through the campaign. However, players are given the option to skip a mission if they have failed it five times in a row. This gives those {{who are interested in}} the story, but less skilled, the chance to continue on with the story without frustration.|$|E

5|$|Hergé also {{introduced}} a new character, Peggy Alcazar, whom he had based upon the American secretary to a Ku Klux Klan spokesman whom Hergé observed in a television documentary. In his preparatory notes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> Hergé had considered introducing Peggy {{as the daughter of}} arms dealer Basil Bazaroff– the satirical depiction of the old times real-life arms dealer Basil Zaharoff, who had appeared in The Broken Ear. He {{also introduced}} the Jolly Follies into the story, a group who were based on three separate touring party groups that Hergé had encountered. He had initially considered a number of alternative names for the troupe, including the Turlupins, Turlurans, and Boutentrins.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Will Robinson and Ken Swartz {{produced}} the documentary Port Chicago MutinyA National Tragedy, about the explosion and trial. They interviewed mutiny convict Joe Small, his defense lawyer Gerald Veltmann, {{as well as}} Percy Robinson, a seaman who returned to loading ammunition after the first work-stoppage, and Robert Routh, Jr., a seaman who was blinded in the blast. Danny Glover provided narration <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> which included dramatized scenes depicting events as they might have occurred in 1944. The documentary was nominated for the Peabody Awards and won an Emmy.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Guys and Dollss success, Feuer and Martin were interested in adapting John Steinbeck's 1945 novel Cannery Row into a musical. They felt {{that some of the}} characters, such as marine biologist Doc, would work well in a musical, but that many of the other characters would not. Steinbeck suggested that he write a sequel to Cannery Row that would feature the characters attractive to Feuer and Martin. Based on suggestions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> line by Feuer and Martin, Steinbeck began to write Sweet Thursday.|$|E
