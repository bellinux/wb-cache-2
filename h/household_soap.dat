In essence, he planned to manufacture and market a range of high quality, price differentiated products, using a strategy based upon his experiences with butter and other commodity products. Thus, instead of selling soap by weight, he had it cut into small, manageable tablets which were individually wrapped. The 1875 Trade Mark Registration Act protected trade names from counterfeiters and imitators, and this opened the way for brand name recognition and consumer loyalty. Within 12 months, Lever had registered a series of Trade Marks, among them “Sunlight”, a house style that was later applied to a range of <b>household</b> <b>soaps.</b>|$|R

Handwashing {{practices}} among caretakers of {{case and}} control children < 5 {{years of age}} enrolled in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study inMirzapur, Bangladesh were characterized and analyzed for association with moderate-to-severe diarrhea. Soap or detergent ownership was common, yet 48 % of case and 47. 7 % of control caretakers also kept ashes for handwashing, including 36. 8 % of the wealthiest <b>households.</b> <b>Soap,</b> detergent, and ash were used for multiple hygiene purposes and were kept together at handwashing areas. Caretakers preferred soap for handwashing, but fre-quently relied on ash, or a detergent/ash mixture, as a low-cost alternative. Moderate-to-severe diarrhea was equally likely for children of caretakers who kept soap versus those who kept ash (matched OR = 0. 91; 0. 62 – 1. 32). Contact with ash and water reduced concentrations of bacterial enteropathogens, without mechanical scrubbing. Thus, washing hands with ash is a prevalent behavior in Mirzapur and may help diminish transmission of diarrheal pathogens to children...|$|R

50|$|Sunlight is a {{brand of}} <b>household</b> <b>soap</b> {{introduced}} by the British company Lever Brothers in 1884. It was the world's first packaged, branded laundry soap. Designed for washing clothes and general household use, {{the success of the}} product led to the name for the company's village for its workers, Port Sunlight. The soap formula was invented by a Bolton chemist named William Hough Watson, who also became an early business partner. Watson's process created a new soap, using glycerin and vegetable oils such as palm oil rather than tallow (animal fats). William Lever and his brother James Darcy Lever invested in Watson's soap invention and its initial success came from offering bars of cut, wrapped, and branded soap in his father's grocery shop. Prior to this, commercially made soap was bought in long bars, an early labour-saving device for the housewife.|$|E

The material integrity of denture materials, including polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and metals, was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and profilometry after treatment with laboratory regimens simulating 2 years of typical consumer use. Treatments were also evaluated in a microbial kill time assay against a range of oral microorganisms with typical treatment regimens. ResultsAlcohol-based mouthwash and IPA damaged the surface of PMMA, and brushing with toothpaste caused scratching and surface material loss. Bleach caused limited damage to PMMA, but corroded CoCr alloy (pitting) and solder (layer formation). Denture tablets caused little damage to any materials apart from the layer formation on silver solder. Vinegar and soap were compatible with all materials. In antimicrobial assays, bleach gave excellent results, and IPA and mouthwash required concentrated dilutions to be effective.

To assess OCV acceptability and knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) regarding cholera and WaSH, we conducted cross-sectional surveys, 1 month before (baseline) and 3 and 12 months after (first and second follow-up) a preemptive OCV campaign in Maela, a long-standing refugee camp on the Thailand-Burma border. We randomly selected households for the surveys, and administered questionnaires to female heads of households. In total, 271 (77 %), 187 (81 %), and 199 (85 %) households were included in the baseline, first and second follow-up surveys, respectively. Anticipated OCV acceptability was 97 % at baseline, and 91 % and 85 % of household members were reported to have received 1 and 2 OCV doses at first follow-up. Compared with baseline, statistically significant differences (95 % Wald confidence interval not overlapping zero) were noted at first and second follow-up among the proportions of respondents who correctly identified two or more means of cholera prevention (62 % versus 78 % and 80 %), reported boiling or treating drinking water (19 % versus 44 % and 69 %), and washing hands with soap (66 % versus 77 % and 85 %); a significant difference was also observed in the proportion of <b>households</b> with <b>soap</b> available at handwashing areas (84 % versus 90 % and 95 %), consistent with reported behaviors.
