40|$|The relaxant {{effect of}} the methyl <b>ester</b> <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> was {{evaluated}} on aortic rings from male Wistar rats (250 - 300 g, 6 rats for each experimental group) with and without endothelium precontracted with 1. 0 µM phenylephrine. The methyl ester presented a slightly greater potency than rosuvastatin in relaxing aortic rings, with log IC 50 values of - 6. 88 and - 6. 07 M, respectively. Unlike rosuvastatin, the effect of its methyl ester was endothelium-independent. Pretreatment with 10 µM indomethacin did not inhibit, and pretreatment with 1 mM mevalonate only modestly inhibited the relaxant {{effect of the}} methyl ester. N&# 969;-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10 µM), the selective nitric oxide- 2 (NO- 2) inhibitor 1400 W (10 µM), tetraethylammonium (TEA, 10 mM), and cycloheximide (10 µM) partially inhibited the relaxant effect of the methyl ester on endothelium-denuded aortic rings. However, the combination of TEA plus either L-NAME or cycloheximide completely inhibited the relaxant effect. Inducible NO synthase (NOS- 2) was only present in endothelium-denuded aortic rings, as demonstrated by immunoblot with methyl ester-treated rings. In conclusion, whereas rosuvastatin {{was associated with a}} relaxant effect dependent on endothelium and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase in rat aorta, the methyl <b>ester</b> <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> exhibited an endothelium-independent and only slightly hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase-dependent relaxant effect.

40|$|In vivo {{studies of}} {{hepatobiliary}} disposition are challenging. The hepatobiliary system is complex, as its physiological localization, complex cellular structure with numerous transporters and enzymes, and the interindividual variability in protein expression and biliary flow will all affect the in vivo disposition {{of a drug}} under investigation. The research included in this thesis {{has focused on the}} involvement of hepatic transport proteins in the hepatobiliary disposition <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin.</b> The impact that several transport inhibitors had on the pharmacokinetics <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> was investigated in healthy volunteers and in pigs. The effects were considerable, following inhibition of sinusoidal transport proteins by cyclosporine and rifampicin. These inhibitors significantly reduced the hepatic extraction <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> by 50 and 35 %, respectively, and the plasma exposure increased by factors of 9. 1 and 6. 3, respectively. Drug-drug interactions (DDI) resulting in markedly higher plasma exposures are important from a drug safety perspective as increased extrahepatic exposure of statins is associated with an increased risk of severe side-effects, such as myopathy which in rare cases could develop into rhabdomyolysis. The DDI caused by cyclosporine and rifampicin can probably be attributed to inhibition of hepatic uptake transporters. In contrast, inhibition of canalicular transporters by imatinib did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin,</b> which suggests that the intracellular concentration of the inhibitor in the hepatocyte was insufficient to affect the transport <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin,</b> or that imatinib is not a sufficiently potent inhibitor in vivo. Furthermore, gemfibrozil administered as a single dose into the jejunum in healthy volunteers and pigs did not affect the plasma or biliary pharmacokinetics <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin.</b> The previously reported DDI in humans upon repeated dosing with gemfibrozil might be explained by the accumulation of metabolites able to affect the disposition <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin.</b> The investigations presented in this thesis conclude that transport proteins are of considerable importance for the hepatobiliary disposition <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> in vivo.

An open-label, three-treatment, fixed-sequence study was conducted. On Day 1, 20  mg <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> was given to all subjects. After a 3 -day washout period, the subjects received 20  mg <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> plus 300  mg of epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG), a major ingredient of green tea (Day 4). After a 10 -day pretreatment of EGCG up to Day 14, they received rosuvastatin (20  mg) plus EGCG (300  mg) once again (Day 15). Blood samples for the pharmacokinetic assessments were collected up to 8  hours after each dose <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin.</b> A total <b>of</b> 13 healthy volunteers were enrolled. Compared with the administration <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> alone, the concomitant use at Day 4 significantly reduced the area under the concentration–time curve from time 0 to the last measurable time (AUClast) by 19 % (geometric mean ratio 0. 81, 90 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 67 – 0. 97) and the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by 15 % (geometric mean ratio 0. 85, 90 % CI 0. 70 – 1. 04).

40|$|Rosuvastatin is {{a member}} of the statin family. Like the other statins it is {{prescribed}} to lower cholesterol levels and thereby reduce the risk <b>of</b> cardiovascular events. <b>Rosuvastatin</b> lowers the cholesterol levels by inhibiting the key enzyme 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) in the cholesterol producing mevalonate pathway. It has been recognized that apart from their beneficial lipid lowering effects, statins also exhibit diabetogenic properties. The molecular mechanisms behind these remain unresolved. To investigate the effects <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> on insulin secretion, we treated INS- 1 832 / 13 cells with varying doses (20 nM to 20 μM) <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> for 48 h. At concentrations of 2 μM and above basal insulin secretion was significantly increased. Using diazoxide we could determine that rosuvastatin did not increase basal insulin secretion by corrupting the KATP channels. Glucose-induced insulin secretion on the other hand seemed to be affected differently at different rosuvastatin concentrations. Rosuvastatin treatment (20 μM) for 24 - 48 h inhibited voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels, which lead to reduced depolarization-induced exocytosis of insulin-containing granules. At lower concentrations <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> (≤ 2 μM) the stimulus-secretion coupling pathway was intact downstream of the KATP channels as assessed by the patch clamp technique. However, a reduction in glucose-induced insulin secretion could be observed with rosuvastatin concentrations as low as 200 nM. The inhibitory effects <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> on glucose-induced insulin secretion could be reversed with mevalonate, but not squalene, indicating that rosuvastatin affects insulin secretion through its effects on the mevalonate pathway, but not through the reduction of cholesterol biosynthesis. Taken together, these data suggest that rosuvastatin has the potential to increase basal insulin secretion and reduce glucose-induced insulin secretion. The latter is possibly an unavoidable side effect <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> treatment as it occurs through the same mechanisms as the lipid-lowering effects of the drug...|$|R

Recently, 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors otherwise known as statins administered before the procedure {{have been shown to}} reduce the incidence of peri-procedural myocardial infarction. Many of the studies that have been done have used atorvastatin and have been limited to peri-procedural outcomes. Will administering a loading dose <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) improve mid and long term outcomes? Methods: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was conducted using Medline-OVID, EBSCO, CINAHL, Health Source-Consumer, and Web of Science using the keywords: rosuvastatin and percutaneous coronary intervention. Relevant articles were assessed for quality using GRADE. Results: Three studies, with one including a 12 -month follow up study met inclusion criteria. A prospective randomized trial of 445 patients that included a 12 -month follow up study concluded that a 40 mg loading dose <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> before PCI improved 12 -month clinical outcomes. A single center, prospective, randomized trial of 160 patients demonstrated that a 40 mg loading dose <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> before elective PCI decreased the incidence of postprocedural MI during a period of 12 months compared to standard treatment.

BackgroundHigh-dose rosuvastatin administered on admission {{has been shown to}} prevent CI-AKI and improve short- and mid-term clinical outcome in ACS patients. MethodsAll 504 statin-naïve ACS patients enrolled in the PRATO-ACS (Protective Effect <b>of</b> <b>Rosuvastatin</b> and Antiplatelet Therapy on Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury and Myocardial Damage in ACS Patients) study were stratified into baseline hs-CRP tertiles: < 2. 7 mg/l, ≥ 2. 7 to < 7. 5 mg/l, and ≥ 7. 5 mg/l. The primary endpoint was CI-AKI occurrence (creatinine ≥ 0. 5 mg/dl or ≥ 25 % above baseline within 72 h). Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between hs-CRP levels and effects <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin.</b> ResultsPatients with higher baseline hs-CRP values presented a significantly higher incidence of CI-AKI (5. 4 %, 8. 7 %, and 18. 3 % in the first, second, and third tertiles, respectively; p = 0. 0001). The beneficial effect <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> was markedly significant in the third hs-CRP tertile (odds ratio: 0. 20; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 07 to 0. 54; p = 0. 002). Statin-treated patients in the third tertile presented a significantly lower rate of adverse events at 30 days (7. 2 % vs. 17. 4 %, p = 0. 043) with a trend toward better outcome at 6 months (6. 02 % vs. 13. 04 %, p = 0. 12). ConclusionsHigh-dose rosuvastatin administered on admission appears to exert more effective kidney protection in ACS subjects with higher baseline hs-CRP levels resulting in better short- and mid-term clinical outcome.

40|$|A {{reliable}} and sensitive isocratic stability indicating RP-HPLC method {{has been developed}} and validated for assay <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> calcium in tablets and for determination of content uniformity. An isocratic separation <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> calcium was achieved on YMC C 8, 150 &# 935; 4. 6 mm i. d., 5 &# 956;m particle size columns with a flow rate of 1. 5 ml/min and using a photodiode array detector to monitor the eluate at 242 nm. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile: water (40 : 60, v/v) pH 3. 5 adjusted with phosphoric acid. The drug was subjected to oxidation, hydrolysis, photolysis and thermal degradation. All degradation products in an overall analytical run time of approximately 10 min with the parent compound rosuvastatin eluting at approximately 5. 2 min. Response was a linear function of drug concentration {{in the range of}} 0. 5 - 80 &# 956;g/ml (r 2 = 0. 9993) with a limit of detection and quantification of 0. 1 and 0. 5 &# 956;g/ml respectively. Accuracy (recovery) was between 99. 6 and 101. 7 &#x 0025;. Degradation products resulting from the stress studies did not interfere with the detection <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> and the assay is thus stability-indicating...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} thin-layer chromatographic method {{has been established}} for analysis <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> calcium and aspirin in bulk & capsule dosage form. Chromatography on silica gel 60 F 254 plates using toluene:butanol:methanol (9 : 1 : 0. 2 v/v/v) as the mobile phase furnished compact spots at Rf 0. 32 ± 0. 02 and 0. 67 ± 0. 03. Densitometric analysis <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> calcium and aspirin {{was carried out in}} the absorbance mode at 234 nm. The minimum amount that could be authentically detected was found to be 22 and 156 ng for rosuvastatin calcium and aspirin respectively. Limit of Quantitation was found to be 68 and 445 ng for rosuvastatin calcium and aspirin respectively. The linear regression analysis data for the calibration plots showed good linear relationship with respect to peak area in the concentration range 200 – 1200 ng/spot for rosuvastatin calcium and 1500 - 9000 ng/spot for aspirin. The method was validated for precision, accuracy and robustness as per ICH guidelines.

40|$|Mixed dyslipidemia, {{characterized}} by a lipid triad of elevated triglycerides (TG), elevated low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduced high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), is a common and frequently difficult to manage condition. The use of combination medications is often needed to effectively treat the lipid triad. The co-administration of statins and fibrates may provide the desired endpoints but safety issues such as toxicity to the muscles, liver and kidneys are a concern. Given the potency <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> to lower LDL-C and fenofibrate’s effectiveness in lowering TG, {{the use of this}} specific combination may be desirable in treating mixed dyslipidemia. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed no significant interactions with the concomitant use <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> and fenofibrate or its active metabolite fenofibric acid. Clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of this combination therapy demonstrate significant reductions in TG and LDL-C levels, and elevations in HDL-C. Safety data from clinical trials reveal no major adverse reactions. However, case reports of adverse events have been published and monitoring for potential adverse reactions of the individual agents is advised. Overall, current data suggest the combination <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> and fenofibrate or fenofibric acid is a safe combination to utilize when managing difficult to treat mixed dyslipidemia patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Rosuvastatin is {{a potent}} HMG-CoA reductase {{inhibitor}} that {{has proven to be}} effective in the treatment <b>of</b> dyslipidemia. <b>Rosuvastatin</b> is cleared from the body by both biliary and renal clearance, the latter believed to be due to active tubular secretion. Whereas the mechanisms of hepatic clearance <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> are well documented, those of renal clearance are not. Because rosuvastatin (and other statins) may alter proximal tubular function, this study aimed to characterize the mechanisms <b>of</b> tubular <b>rosuvastatin</b> secretion to define the factors that could influence the presence/concentration <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> in proximal tubular cells. Hereto, polarized monolayers of primary human tubular cells were used. We found rosuvastatin net secretion across proximal tubule cells, which was saturable (K- 50 = 20. 4 +/- 4. 1 mu M). The basolateral uptake step was rate-limiting and mediated by OAT 3. Rosuvastatin efflux at the apical membrane was mediated by MRP 2 / 4 and ABCG 2 together with a small contribution from MDR 1 or P-glycoprotein. These data, obtained in an intact human tubule cell model, provide a detailed insight into rosuvastatin's renal handling and the possible factors influencing it...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effects <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> treatment on papillary thyroid carcinoma. The papillary thyroid carsinoma (B-CPAP) and normal (Nthy-ori 3 - 1) thyroid cell lines were treated with rosuvastatin at 12. 5 µM, 18. 5 µM, 25 µM, 50 µM, 100 µM, 200 µM concentrations. After 48 and 72 hours <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> treatment; MTT, Ki- 67 immunolabelling, FACS analysis, electron microscopy, caspase- 3 and TUNEL analysis were performed. Decreased cell viability and G 1 phase arrest were detected in papillary thyroid cell line with rosuvastatin treatment. We observed positive immunoreactivity of Ki- 67 and dose dependent increase in S phase on Nthy-ori 3 - 1 cells. B-CPAP cells showed intense vacuolization and autophagosomes with low concentrations and 48 h incubations while Nthy-ori 3 - 1 cells showed these changes at higher concentrations. A decrease in the percentage of cells showing autophagy was determined with increasing concentrations <b>of</b> <b>rosuvastatin</b> in B-CPAP cells. Rosuvastatin treatment also caused a dose and time dependent increase in caspase- 3 activity and apoptotic index by TUNEL assay in B-CPAP cells as compared with the Nthy-ori 3 - 1 cells.
