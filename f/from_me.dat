5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning <b>from</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

5|$|I'll {{say that}} the Ukrainian people treated me well. I recall warmly the years I spent there. This was a period full of responsibilities, but {{pleasant}} because it brought satisfaction... But far be it <b>from</b> <b>me</b> to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.|$|E
5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away <b>from</b> <b>me</b> when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E
5|$|The panels contain {{quotations}} in Latin {{from several}} biblical texts. They appear either as lettering seemingly sewn into {{the edges of}} the figures' clothes (mostly hidden in the folds), or directly {{on the surface of the}} central inner panel. The latter occur in four instances; two pairs of text float on either side of Christ, two around Michael. Beneath the lily, in white paint are the words of Christ: VENITE BENEDICTI PATRIS MEI POSSIDETE PARATUM VOBIS REGNUM A CONSTITUTIONE MUNDI ("Come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundations of the world"). The text beneath the sword reads: DISCEDITE A ME MALEDICTI IN IGNEM ÆTERNUM QUI PARATUS EST DIABOLO ET ANGELIS EJUS ("Depart <b>from</b> <b>me</b> ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels").|$|E

5|$|Meyerbeer's {{personal}} {{attachment to}} Judaism was a mature personal decision – {{after the death}} of his maternal grandfather in 1811 he wrote to his mother 'Please accept <b>from</b> <b>me</b> a promise that I will always live in the religion in which he died'. In his diaries he noted significant family events including birthdays, not by their Gregorian calendar occurrence, but by their Jewish calendar dates. Moreover, he regularly suffered from (and/or imagined) anti-Jewish slights throughout his life, warning his brothers frequently in his letters against richess (Yiddish for 'Jew-hatred'). Writing to Heinrich Heine in 1839, he offered the fatalistic view:I believe that richess is like love in the theatres and novels: no matter how often one encounters it...it never misses its target if effectively wielded... can grow back the foreskin of which we are robbed on the eighth day of life; those who, on the ninth day, do not bleed from this operation shall continue to bleed an entire lifetime, even after death.|$|E
