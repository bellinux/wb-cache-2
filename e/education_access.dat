25|$|Despite {{significant}} progress, <b>education</b> <b>access</b> {{and school}} completion remains unequal in Latin America. The region has made great progress in educational coverage; almost all children attend primary school {{and access to}} secondary education has increased considerably. Quality issues such as poor teaching methods, lack of appropriate equipment and overcrowding exist throughout the region. These issues lead to adolescents {{dropping out of the}} educational system early. Most educational systems in the region have implemented various types of administrative and institutional reforms that have enabled reach for places and communities that had no access to education services in the early 1990s.

25|$|Private higher {{education}} institutions cannot operate {{if they are not}} recognized by the Ministry of <b>Education.</b> <b>Access</b> is regulated by the same procedures as those for state {{higher education}} institutions. The two systems of higher education (university and polytechnic) are linked and it is possible to transfer {{from one to the other}} by extraordinary competition. It is also possible to transfer from a public institution to a private one and vice versa. Admission to public university programmes are often more demanding and selective than to their equivalent in public polytechnic and private institutions. Many specific university institutions and degrees are also regarded as more prestigious and reputed than their peers from the polytechnic system or from certain less notable university institutions.|$|E

40|$|In Australia, {{regional}} and remote Indigenous students are under-represented in both {{higher education and}} vocational <b>education</b> and training. <b>Access</b> <b>education</b> courses are important strategies for lifting participation rates and potentially encouraging mobility between the sectors, yet {{there is little evidence}} underpinning their development, composition and delivery. This paper presents the results of qualitative interviews with staff and students involved in <b>access</b> <b>education</b> programs. The research, which is underpinned by the strengths-based approach of conscientisation, explores how Indigenous learning journeys via <b>access</b> <b>education</b> can respect and grow cultural identity whilst simultaneously developing study skills. This research demonstrates that staff and students have opinions about what and how Indigenous knowledges should be developed and delivered within the curriculum. The researchers bring together the findings of their research and relevant literature to propose that <b>access</b> <b>education</b> can be strengthened by the inclusion of Indigenous content and Indigenous pedagogies. The authors propose a model for strengthening, transforming and success in Indigenous <b>access</b> <b>education</b> and a conceptual model for best practice...|$|R
