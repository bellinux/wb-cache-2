25|$|By 1869, {{when the}} {{pioneering}} Swiss ophthalmologist Johann Horner wrote a thesis entitled On {{the treatment of}} <b>keratoconus,</b> the disorder had acquired its current name. The treatment at that time, endorsed by the leading German ophthalmologist Albrecht von Graefe, {{was an attempt to}} physically reshape the cornea by chemical cauterization with a silver nitrate solution and application of a miosis-causing agent with a pressure dressing. In 1888, the treatment of <b>keratoconus</b> {{became one of the first}} practical applications of the then newly invented contact lens, when the French physician Eugène Kalt manufactured a glass scleral shell that improved vision by compressing the cornea into a more regular shape. Since the start of the 20th century, research on <b>keratoconus</b> has both improved understanding of the disease and greatly expanded the range of treatment options. The first successful corneal transplantation to treat <b>keratoconus</b> was done in 1936 by Ramon Castroviejo.|$|E
25|$|In {{people with}} <b>keratoconus,</b> rigid contact lenses improve vision {{by means of}} tear fluid filling {{the gap between the}} {{irregular}} corneal surface and the smooth regular inner surface of the lens, thereby creating the effect of a smoother cornea. Many specialized types of contact lenses have been developed for <b>keratoconus,</b> and affected people may seek out both doctors specialized in conditions of the cornea, and contact lens fitters who have experience managing people with <b>keratoconus.</b> The irregular cone presents a challenge and the fitter will endeavor to produce a lens with the optimal contact, stability and steepness. Some trial-and-error fitting may prove necessary.|$|E

25|$|The National Eye Institute reports <b>keratoconus</b> is {{the most}} common corneal {{dystrophy}} in the United States, affecting about one in 2,000 Americans, but some reports place the figure as high as one in 500. The inconsistency may be due to variations in diagnostic criteria, with some cases of severe astigmatism interpreted as those of <b>keratoconus,</b> and vice versa. A long-term study found a mean incidence rate of 2.0 new cases per 100,000 population per year. Some studies have suggested a higher prevalence amongst females, or that people of South Asian ethnicity are 4.4 times as likely to suffer from <b>keratoconus</b> as Caucasians, and {{are also more likely to}} be affected with the condition earlier.|$|E
25|$|<b>Keratoconus</b> - a {{degenerative}} disease, {{the cornea}} thins and changes shape {{to be more}} like a cone.|$|E
25|$|Radial keratotomy is a {{refractive}} surgery procedure where the surgeon makes a spoke-like pattern of incisions into the cornea to modify its shape. This early surgical option for myopia {{has been largely}} superseded by LASIK and other similar procedures. LASIK is absolutely contraindicated in <b>keratoconus</b> and other corneal thinning conditions as removal of corneal stromal tissue will further damage an already thin and weak cornea. For similar reasons, radial keratotomy has also generally not been used for people with <b>keratoconus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Keraflex: a thermobiochemical {{solution}} {{which has}} received the CE Mark for refractive correction. and is in European clinical trials for the correction of myopia and <b>keratoconus.</b>|$|E
25|$|A genetic {{predisposition}} to <b>keratoconus</b> has been observed, {{with the disease}} running in certain families, and incidences reported of concordance in identical twins. The frequency of occurrence in close family members is not clearly defined, though it {{is known to be}} considerably higher than that in the general population, and studies have obtained estimates ranging between 6% and 19%. Two studies involving isolated, largely homogenetic communities have contrarily mapped putative gene locations to chromosomes 16q and 20q. Most genetic studies agree on an autosomal dominant model of inheritance. A rare, autosomal dominant form of severe <b>keratoconus</b> with anterior polar cataract is caused by a mutation in the seed region of mir-184, a microRNA that is highly expressed in the cornea and anterior lens. <b>Keratoconus</b> is diagnosed more often in people with Down's syndrome, though the reasons for this link have not yet been determined.|$|E
25|$|<b>Keratoconus</b> is {{normally}} bilateral (affecting both eyes) although the distortion is usually asymmetric and is rarely completely identical in both corneas. Unilateral cases {{tend to be}} uncommon, and {{may in fact be}} very rare if a very mild condition in the better eye is simply below the limit of clinical detection. It is common for <b>keratoconus</b> to be diagnosed first in one eye and not until later in the other. As the condition then progresses in both eyes, the vision in the earlier-diagnosed eye will often remain poorer than that in its fellow.|$|E
25|$|Keratoglobus is a {{very rare}} {{condition}} that causes corneal thinning primarily at the margins, resulting in a spherical, slightly enlarged eye. It may be genetically related to <b>keratoconus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Patients with <b>keratoconus</b> {{typically}} present initially {{with mild}} astigmatism and myopia, commonly {{at the onset}} of puberty, and are diagnosed by the late teenage years or early 20s. The disease can, however, present or progress at any age; in rare cases, <b>keratoconus</b> can present in children or not until later adulthood. A diagnosis of the disease at an early age may indicate a greater risk of severity in later life. Patients' vision will seem to fluctuate over a period of months, driving them to change lens prescriptions frequently, but as the condition worsens, contact lenses are required in the majority of cases. The course of the disorder can be quite variable, with some patients remaining stable for years or indefinitely, while others progress rapidly or experience occasional exacerbations over a long and otherwise steady course. Most commonly, <b>keratoconus</b> progresses for a period of 10 to 20 years before the course of the disease generally ceases in the third and fourth decades of life.|$|E
25|$|The acute {{recovery}} period can take {{four to six}} weeks, and full postoperative vision stabilization often takes a year or more, but most transplants are very stable in the long term. The National <b>Keratoconus</b> Foundation reports that penetrating keratoplasty has the most successful outcome of all transplant procedures, and when performed for <b>keratoconus</b> in an otherwise healthy eye, its success rate can be 95% or greater. The sutures used usually dissolve {{over a period of}} three to five years, but individual sutures can be removed during the healing process if they are causing irritation to the person.|$|E
25|$|Corneal {{collagen}} cross-linking is {{a developing}} treatment {{which aims to}} strengthen the cornea, however, according to a 2015 Cochrane review, there is insufficient evidence to determine if it is useful in <b>keratoconus.</b>|$|E
25|$|A rigid lens is able {{to replace}} the natural shape of the contact (cornea) with a new refracting surface. This means that a spherical rigid contact lens can correct astigmatism. Rigids can also be made as a front-toric, back-toric, or bitoric. This is {{different}} from a spherical contact lens in that one or both surfaces of the lens deliver a toric correction. Rigids can also correct for corneal irregularities, such as <b>keratoconus.</b> In most cases, patients with <b>keratoconus</b> see better through rigids than through glasses. Rigids are more chemically inert, allowing them to be worn in more challenging environments than soft lenses.|$|E
25|$|The use of intacs {{implants}} {{has been}} tested {{as a treatment for}} PMD, with slight improvement in visual acuity noted after eleven months, and intacs have been used with <b>keratoconus</b> with success.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{findings}} of the Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of <b>Keratoconus</b> (CLEK), people who have <b>keratoconus</b> could be expected to pay more than $25,000 over their lifetime post-diagnosis, {{with a standard deviation of}} $19,396. There is limited evidence on the costs of corneal cross-linking, a cost-effectiveness study estimated the costs of the total treatment for one person as £928 ($1,392 U.S.) in the UK National Health Service, but this may be as high as $2,500 per eye in other countries. A 2013 cost-benefit analysis by the Lewin Group for Eye Bank Association of America, estimated an average cost of $16,500 for each corneal transplant.|$|E
25|$|Prior to any {{physical}} examination, {{the diagnosis of}} <b>keratoconus</b> frequently begins with an ophthalmologist's or optometrist's assessment of the person's medical history, particularly the chief complaint and other visual symptoms, the presence of any history of ocular disease or injury which might affect vision, {{and the presence of}} any family history of ocular disease. An eye chart, such as a standard Snellen chart of progressively smaller letters, is then used to determine the person's visual acuity. The eye examination may proceed to measurement of the localized curvature of the cornea with a manual keratometer, with detection of irregular astigmatism suggesting a possibility of <b>keratoconus.</b> Severe cases can exceed the instrument's measuring ability. A further indication can be provided by retinoscopy, in which a light beam is focused on the person's retina and the reflection, or reflex, observed as the examiner tilts the light source back and forth. <b>Keratoconus</b> is amongst the ophthalmic conditions that exhibit a scissor reflex action of two bands moving toward and away from each other like the blades of a pair of scissors.|$|E
25|$|Corneal ectasia is a {{progressive}} thinning of the cornea; {{the most common}} form of this condition is <b>keratoconus.</b> Collagen cross-linking by applying riboflavin topically then shining UV light is a method to slow progression of corneal ectasia by strengthening corneal tissue.|$|E
25|$|Posterior <b>keratoconus,</b> a {{distinct}} disorder despite its similar name, {{is a rare}} abnormality, usually congenital, which causes a nonprogressive thinning of the inner surface of the cornea, while the curvature of the anterior surface remains normal. Usually only a single eye is affected.|$|E
25|$|In the USA, corneal transplants (also {{known as}} corneal grafts) for <b>keratoconus</b> are usually {{performed}} under sedation as outpatient surgery. In other countries, such as Australia and the UK, {{the operation is}} commonly performed with the person undergoing a general anaesthetic. All cases require a careful follow-up with an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) {{for a number of}} years. Frequently, vision is greatly improved after the surgery, but even if the actual visual acuity does not improve, because the cornea is a more normal shape after the healing is completed, people can more easily be fitted with corrective lenses. Complications of corneal transplants are mostly related to vascularization of the corneal tissue and rejection of the donor cornea. Vision loss is very rare, though difficult-to-correct vision is possible. When rejection is severe, repeat transplants are often attempted, and are frequently successful. <b>Keratoconus</b> will not normally reoccur in the transplanted cornea; incidences of this have been observed, but are usually attributed to incomplete excision of the original cornea or inadequate screening of the donor tissue. The long-term outlook for corneal transplants performed for <b>keratoconus</b> is usually favorable once the initial healing period is completed and a few years have elapsed without problems.|$|E
25|$|Between 11% and 27% {{of cases}} of <b>keratoconus</b> will {{progress}} {{to a point where}} vision correction is no longer possible, thinning of the cornea becomes excessive, or scarring as a result of contact lens wear causes problems of its own, and a corneal transplantation or penetrating keratoplasty becomes required. <b>Keratoconus</b> is the most common grounds for conducting a penetrating keratoplasty, generally accounting for around a quarter of such procedures. The corneal transplant surgeon trephines a lenticule of corneal tissue and then grafts the donor cornea to the existing eye tissue, usually using a combination of running and individual sutures. The cornea does not have a direct blood supply, so the donor tissue is not required to be blood type matched. Eye banks check the donor corneas for any disease or cellular irregularities.|$|E
25|$|<b>Keratoconus</b> (KC) is a {{disorder}} {{of the eye}} which results in progressive thinning of the cornea. This may result in blurry vision, double vision, nearsightedness, astigmatism, and light sensitivity. Usually both eyes are affected. In more severe cases a scarring or a circle may be seen within the cornea.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{considerable}} research, {{the cause}} of <b>keratoconus</b> remains unclear. Several sources suggest that <b>keratoconus</b> likely arises {{from a number of}} different factors: genetic, environmental or cellular, any of which may form the trigger for the onset of the disease. Once initiated, the disease normally develops by progressive dissolution of Bowman's layer, which lies between the corneal epithelium and stroma. As the two come into contact, cellular and structural changes in the cornea adversely affect its integrity and lead to the bulging and scarring characteristic of the disorder. Within any individual keratoconic cornea, regions of degenerative thinning coexisting with regions undergoing wound healing may be found. Scarring appears to be an aspect of the corneal degradation; however, a recent, large, multicenter study suggests abrasion by contact lenses may increase the likelihood of this finding by a factor over two.|$|E
25|$|People {{with early}} <b>keratoconus</b> {{typically}} notice a minor blurring of their vision {{and come to}} their clinician seeking corrective lenses for reading or driving. At early stages, the symptoms of <b>keratoconus</b> may be no {{different from those of}} any other refractive defect of the eye. As the disease progresses, vision deteriorates, sometimes rapidly. Visual acuity becomes impaired at all distances, and night vision is often poor. Some individuals have vision in one eye that is markedly worse than that in the other. The disease is often bilateral, though asymmetrical. Some develop photophobia (sensitivity to bright light), eye strain from squinting in order to read, or itching in the eye, but there is normally little or no sensation of pain. It may cause luminous objects to appear as cylindrical pipes with the same intensity at all points.|$|E
25|$|<b>Keratoconus</b> affects about 1 in 2000 people. It occurs most {{commonly}} in late childhood to early adulthood. While {{it occurs in}} all populations {{it may be more}} frequent in certain ethnic groups such as those of Asian descent. The word is from the Greek kéras meaning cornea and the Latin cōnus meaning cone.|$|E
25|$|In {{early stages}} of <b>keratoconus,</b> glasses or soft contact lenses can suffice to correct for the mild astigmatism. As the {{condition}} progresses, these may no longer provide the person with a satisfactory degree of visual acuity, and most practitioners will move to manage the condition with rigid contact lenses, known as rigid, gas-permeable, (RGP) lenses. RGP lenses provide a good level of visual correction, but do not arrest progression of the condition.|$|E
25|$|If <b>keratoconus</b> is suspected, the {{ophthalmologist}} or optometrist will {{search for}} other characteristic {{findings of the}} disease by means of slit lamp examination of the cornea. An advanced case is usually readily apparent to the examiner, and can provide for an unambiguous diagnosis prior to more specialized testing. Under close examination, a ring of yellow-brown to olive-green pigmentation known as a Fleischer ring {{can be observed in}} around half of keratoconic eyes. The Fleischer ring, caused by deposition of the iron oxide hemosiderin within the corneal epithelium, is subtle and may not be readily detectable in all cases, but becomes more evident when viewed under a cobalt blue filter. Similarly, around 50% of subjects exhibit Vogt's striae, fine stress lines within the cornea caused by stretching and thinning. The striae temporarily disappear while slight pressure is applied to the eyeball. A highly pronounced cone can create a V-shaped indentation in the lower eyelid when the person's gaze is directed downwards, known as Munson's sign. Other clinical signs of <b>keratoconus</b> will normally have presented themselves long before Munson's sign becomes apparent, and so this finding, though a classic sign of the disease, tends not to be of primary diagnostic importance.|$|E
25|$|Rarely, a nonpenetrating {{keratoplasty}} {{known as}} an epikeratophakia (or epikeratoplasty) may be performed in cases of <b>keratoconus.</b> The corneal epithelium is removed and a lenticule of donor cornea is grafted on top of it. The procedure requires a greater level of skill {{on the part of}} the surgeon, and is less frequently performed than a penetrating keratoplasty, as the outcome is generally less favorable. However, it may be seen as an option in a number of cases, particularly for young people.|$|E
25|$|The {{predominant}} optical aberration {{of the eye}} in <b>keratoconus</b> is coma. The visual distortion {{experienced by}} the person comes from two sources, one being the irregular deformation of {{the surface of the}} cornea, and the other being scarring that occurs on its exposed highpoints. These factors act to form regions on the cornea that map an image to different locations on the retina. The effect can worsen in low light conditions, as the dark-adapted pupil dilates to expose more of the irregular surface of the cornea.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{contact lenses}} for <b>keratoconus</b> {{have been the}} 'hard' or RGP variety, {{although}} manufacturers have also produced specialized 'soft' or hydrophilic lenses and, most recently, silicone hydrogel lenses. A soft lens {{has a tendency to}} conform to the conical shape of the cornea, thus diminishing its effect. To counter this, hybrid lenses have been developed which are hard in the centre and encompassed by a soft skirt. However, soft or earlier generation hybrid lenses did not prove effective for every person. Early generation lenses have been discontinued. The fourth generation of hybrid lens technology has improved, giving more people an option that combines the comfort of a soft lens with the visual acuity of an RGP lens.|$|E
25|$|People {{choose to}} wear contact lenses for many reasons. Aesthetics and {{cosmetics}} {{are the main}} motivating factors {{for people who want}} to avoid wearing glasses or to change the appearance of their eyes. Others wear contact lenses for functional or optical reasons. When compared with spectacles, contact lenses typically provide better peripheral vision, and do not collect moisture (from rain, snow, condensation etc.) or perspiration. This can make them preferable for sports and other outdoor activities. Contact lens wearers can also wear sunglasses, goggles, or other eyewear of their choice without having to fit them with prescription lenses or worry about compatibility with glasses. Additionally, there are conditions such as <b>keratoconus</b> and aniseikonia that are typically corrected better with contact lenses than with glasses.|$|E
25|$|A {{scleral lens}} is a large, firm, oxygen {{permeable}} contact lens that {{rests on the}} sclera and creates a tear-filled vault over the cornea. The cause of this unique positioning is usually relevant to a specific patient whose cornea is too sensitive to support the lens directly. Scleral lenses {{may be used to}} improve vision and reduce pain and light sensitivity for people suffering from a growing number of disorders or injuries to the eye, such as severe dry eye syndrome (Kerotanconjuctivis sicca), microphthalmia, <b>keratoconus,</b> corneal ectasia, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, Sjögren's syndrome, aniridia, neurotrophic keratitis (aneasthetic corneas), complications post-LASIK, high order Aberrations of the eye, complications post-corneal transplant and pellucid degeneration. Injuries to the eye such as surgical complications, distorted corneal implants, as well as chemical and burn injuries also may be treated with scleral lenses.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{indicated}} keratoconic corneas show signs of increased activity by proteases, a class of enzymes that break some of the collagen cross-linkages in the stroma, with a simultaneous reduced expression of protease inhibitors. Other studies have suggested that reduced activity by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase may be responsible for a build-up of free radicals and oxidising species in the cornea. Whatever the pathogenetical process, the damage caused by activity within the cornea likely results in a reduction in its thickness and biomechanical strength. At an ultrastructural level the weakening of the corneal tissue is associated with a disruption of the regular arrangement of the collagen layers and collagen fibril orientation. While <b>keratoconus</b> is considered a noninflammatory disorder, one study shows wearing rigid contact lenses by people leads to overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF-alpha, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 in the tear fluid.|$|E
25|$|The {{patient may}} be {{examined}} with pupillary dilation and education given {{prior to the}} procedure. Before the surgery, the patient's corneas are examined with a pachymeter to determine their thickness, and with a topographer, or corneal topography machine, to measure their surface contour. Using low-power lasers, a topographer creates a topographic map of the cornea. The procedure is contraindicated if the topographer finds difficulties such as <b>keratoconus</b> The preparatory process also detects astigmatism and other irregularities {{in the shape of}} the cornea. Using this information, the surgeon calculates the amount and the location of corneal tissue to be removed. The patient is prescribed and self-administers an antibiotic beforehand to minimize the risk of infection after the procedure and is sometimes offered a short acting oral sedative medication as a pre-medication. Prior to the procedure, anaesthetic eye drops are instilled. Factors that may rule out LASIK for some patients include large pupils, thin corneas and extremely dry eyes.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Keratoconus</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with atopic diseases, which include asthma, allergies, and eczema, and {{it is not uncommon for}} several or all of these diseases to affect one person. [...] <b>Keratoconus</b> is also associated with Alport syndrome, Down syndrome and Marfan syndrome. [...] A number of studies suggest vigorous eye rubbing contributes to the progression of <b>keratoconus,</b> and people should be discouraged from the practice. <b>Keratoconus</b> differs from ectasia which is caused by LASIK eye surgery. [...] Post-LASIK Ectasia {{has been associated}} with the excessive removal of the eye's stromal bed tissue during surgery.|$|E
