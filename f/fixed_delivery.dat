50|$|Since {{in all but}} the trivial {{example of}} {{constant}} demand there will actually be fluctuations in required production, FRS is only part of a scheduling solution. The challenge in the early steps of implementation is to isolate the maximum part of production that can be fixed from the part of production that cannot. This isolation, at least in the early stages, should extend to the supporting services as well as the value adding process or gemba itself. Thus procurement, stock keeping, deliveries and so on should be run separately for the fixed and non-fixed schedules. For example, this means two procurement 'contracts'; one for <b>fixed</b> <b>deliveries</b> of <b>fixed</b> amounts at regular intervals and one for deliveries as otherwise requested.

40|$|In most {{classical}} scheduling models, it {{is assumed}} that a job is dispatched to a customer immediately after its processing completes. In many practical situations, however, a set of delivery dates may be fixed before any jobs are processed. This is particularly relevant where delivery is an expensive or complicated operation, for example, as with heavy machinery. A similar situation arises where customers find deliveries disruptive and thus require them to be made within a limited time interval that repeats periodically. A third possibility is that a periodic business function, for example, the supplier's billing cycle, effectively defines a delivery date, and includes all jobs that have been completed since the previous billing cycle. These situations are not adequately represented by classical scheduling models. We consider a variety of deterministic scheduling problems in which a job is dispatched to a customer at the earliest <b>fixed</b> <b>delivery</b> date that is no earlier than the completion time of its processing. Problems where the number of delivery dates is constant, and others where it is specified as part of data input, are studied. For almost all problems considered, we either provide an efficient algorithm or establish that such an algorithm is unlikely to exist. By doing so, we permit comparisons between the solvability of these <b>fixed</b> <b>delivery</b> date problems and of the corresponding classical scheduling problem...|$|E

This study’s {{purpose was to}} analyze the impact of industrial context on procurement, management, and development of harvesting services. Using interviews, functions were modeled at two forest owners associations (FOAs) with outsourced harvesting services. One FOA had its own sawmills, requiring frequent harvesting production adjustments to meet varying volume demand in the short-term. The long-term uncertainty was however low because of good visibility of future demand (> 6 months). The other FOA did not own mills and produced wood according to <b>fixed</b> six-month <b>delivery</b> contracts. This meant few short-term production adjustments, but long-term uncertainty due to low visibility of future demand. Demand uncertainty resulted in corresponding needs for harvesting capacity flexibility. This could have been met by a corresponding proportion of short-term contracts for capacity. In this study, however, a large proportion (> 90 %) of long-term contracts was found, motivated by a perceived contractor shortage. It was also noted that although contractor investment cycles (4 – 6 years) matched the FOAs’ strategic horizons (3 – 5 years), contractors’ investment plans were not considered in the FOAs’ strategic planning.
