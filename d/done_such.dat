5|$|The Dresden Codex is {{described}} by historian J. Eric S. Thompson as writings of the indigenous people of the Yucatán Peninsula in southeastern Mexico. Maya historians Peter J. Schmidt, Mercedes de la Garza, and Enrique Nalda confirm this. Thompson further narrows the probable origin of the Dresden Codex {{to the area of}} Chichen Itza, because certain picture symbols in the codex are only found on monuments in that location. He also argues that the astronomical tables would support this as the place of origin. Thompson claims that the people of the Yucatán Peninsula were known to have <b>done</b> <b>such</b> studies around 1200 A.D. Thompson also notes the similar ceramic designs in the Chichen Itza area which are known to have ceased in the early thirteenth century. British historian Clive Ruggles suggests, based on the analyses of several scholars, that the Dresden Codex is a copy and was originally written between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries. Thompson narrows the date closer to 1200 to 1250. Maya archaeologist Linton Satterthwaite puts the date when it was made as no later than 1345. It is the oldest surviving book from the Americas.|$|E

25|$|Another way to {{deal with}} it is to allow that {{experiments}} with processes of heat transfer to or from the system may be used to justify the formula (1) above. Moreover, it deals to some extent with the problem of lack of direct experimental evidence that the time order of stages of a process does not matter in the determination of internal energy. This way does not provide theoretical purity in terms of adiabatic work processes, but is empirically feasible, and is in accord with experiments actually <b>done,</b> <b>such</b> as the Joule experiments mentioned just above, and with older traditions.|$|E
25|$|In 1925, Thurber {{moved to}} Greenwich Village in New York City, {{getting a job}} as a {{reporter}} for the New York Evening Post. He joined the staff of The New Yorker in 1927 as an editor, with the help of E.B. White, his friend and fellow New Yorker contributor. His career as a cartoonist began in 1930 after White found some of Thurber's drawings in a trash can and submitted them for publication; White inked-in some of these earlier drawings to make them reproduce better for the magazine, and years later expressed deep regret that he had <b>done</b> <b>such</b> a thing. Thurber contributed both his writings and his drawings to The New Yorker until the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it right out of the middle of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held out the right hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, right in the middle of his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the non-striker, were among the wanderers, and he was certain that everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where it had gone. When, finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, there was definitely a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor looked at him disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have <b>done</b> <b>such</b> a thing, and he walked off gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to be curious as to what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens man for a long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he was foolish to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, he definitely appreciated it.|$|E

500|$|The janissaries, {{under the}} command of Mihaloğlu Ali Bey, pursued the Wallachians and killed 1,000-2,000 of them. According to the chronicle of the Venetan bailo at the Porte, Domenico Balbi, the total {{casualties}} for the conflict are numbered as 5,000 for the Wallachian side and 15,000 for the Ottomans. Even though the morale of the sultan and his army was low, Mehmed decided to besiege the capital, but instead found it deserted with its gates wide open. The Turkish army entered the capital and for half an hour, the army marched on the road that was bordered by some 20,000 impaled Turks. There, they found the rotten corpse of Hamza Pasha impaled on the highest stake, to symbolize his 'high ranking'. Other sources say that the city was defended by the soldiers, while the impaled corpses lay outside the city-walls for a distance of 60 miles. Chalkokondyles, when remarking the reaction of the sultan, wrote: [...] "The sultan was seized with amazement and said that {{it was not possible to}} deprive of his country a man who had <b>done</b> <b>such</b> great deeds, who had such a diabolical understanding of how to govern his realm and its people. And he said that a man who had <b>done</b> <b>such</b> things was worth much." ...|$|E

500|$|In act 2, when Tosca sings offstage the cantata {{that celebrates}} the {{supposed}} defeat of Napoleon, Puccini {{was tempted to}} follow the text of Sardou's play and use the music of Giovanni Paisiello, before finally writing his own imitation of Paisello's style. It was not until 29September 1899 that Puccini was able to mark the final page of the score as completed. Despite the notation, there was additional work to be <b>done,</b> <b>such</b> as the shepherd boy's song {{at the start of}} act 3. Puccini, who always sought to put local colour in his works, wanted that song to be in Roman dialect. The composer asked a friend to have a [...] "good romanesco poet" [...] write some words; eventually the poet and folklorist [...] wrote the verse which, after slight modification, was placed in the opera.|$|E

500|$|Television critics reacted mostly {{positive}} {{toward the}} episode, calling the storyline [...] "heartfelt."

[...] Kaiser went on to compliment series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, stating [...] "some of the more recent formal experiments that the show has <b>done,</b> <b>such</b> as the hour-long murder mystery in this season's premiere, indicate that MacFarlane and company agree with the criticism." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "I have to give props to Family Guy for going outside their wheelhouse without winking excessively at their audience, but I think {{it may have been a}} little bit too far to be truly great." [...] Kaiser ultimately gave the episode a B rating, the best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'" [...] and The Simpsons episode [...] "Moms I'd Like to Forget". In another positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's [...] "funniest moments," [...] which included the opening sequence involving Peter and the Red Bull, as well as the reference to The Price Is Right. Hughes went on to comment that the episode [...] "taught us about the depths and bonds of love that make a family. Whether it's acceptance, hope or sacrifice, there's no limit to what we will do for family." [...] Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also commented positively on the episode, writing in her review of the storyline, [...] "Overall, I found the installment to be refreshing with everyone taking a part in Peter’s dilemma. It was actually sweet and emotional for a change." [...] Moon also praised the scenes involving President Obama, and Stewie's attempt at saving Brian.|$|E
