5|$|Elaborate body {{structures}} of many modern-day animals usually serve to attract {{members of the}} opposite sex during mating. It is quite possible that the sails or <b>humps</b> of these dinosaurs were used for courtship, in a way similar to a peacock's tail.

5|$|Although {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} a biped, {{it has been suggested}} since the mid-1970s that Spinosaurus was at least an occasional quadruped. This has been bolstered by the discovery of Baryonyx, a relative with robust arms. Because of the mass of the hypothesized fatty dorsal <b>humps</b> of Spinosaurus, Bailey (1997) was open to the possibility of a quadrupedal posture, leading to new restorations of it as such. The hypothesis that Spinosaurus had a typical quadrupedal gait has fallen out of favor, though spinosaurids may have crouched in a quadrupedal posture.|$|E
40|$|The Korean <b>hump</b> nose often {{differs from}} Caucasian <b>hump</b> nose {{in that the}} size of the nasal <b>hump</b> is not {{prominent}} and the <b>hump</b> is frequently associated with a low nasal dorsum and ra-dix with under-projected nasal tip. Therefore, typical reductive rhinoplasty techniques are not effective in managing the characteristic anatomy of the Korean <b>hump</b> nose. Because Korean <b>hump</b> nose patients have all kinds of nasal deformity including low dorsal profile, abnormal tip projection, tip rotation and deviation, surgeons should be skilled at various techniques of rhino-plasty. Removal of <b>hump</b> should be performed gradually considering the balance of nasal tip and nasal dorsum and radix. Small <b>hump</b> with low radix can be corrected by radix augmentation. If the <b>hump</b> is big, the <b>hump</b> should not be remained by too conservative removal of the <b>hump.</b> Mos...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a sectionwise hydroforming technique for manufacturing of large-area multi-cell sheet metal structures {{in terms of}} <b>hump</b> plates. The sectionwise hydroforming technique allows production of <b>hump</b> sheets with variable width and length. The <b>hump</b> plates are based on hexagonal <b>hump</b> geometry. The <b>hump</b> height is optimized for the application as a partition wall in light utility vehicles. Manufactured <b>hump</b> sheets feature a high contour accuracy which allows joining of two <b>hump</b> sheets to a large-area <b>hump</b> plate (up to 1, 800 x 2, 000 mm). The <b>hump</b> plates have been successfully tested in a load test which proves their potential for light utility vehicles...|$|R

5|$|Born in London {{and raised}} largely in Brighton, Grinsell {{developed}} an early interest in archaeology through visits to Brighton Museum. Later {{working as a}} bank clerk in London, he embarked on archaeological research in an amateur capacity, visiting prehistoric barrows during his weekends and holidays in order to record their shape, dimensions, and location. On {{the basis of his}} research, he published a range of academic articles and books on the subject of barrows during the 1930s, gaining recognition as Britain's foremost expert on the subject. In 1933, he carried out his only archaeological excavation, at the Devil's <b>Humps</b> in Sussex.|$|E
5|$|Camel {{hybridisation}} {{began in}} the first millennium BC. For about a thousand years, Bactrian camels and dromedaries have been successfully bred in regions where they are sympatric to form hybrids with either a long, slightly lopsided hump or two <b>humps</b> – one small and one large. These hybrids are larger and stronger than their parents – they can bear greater loads. A cross between a first generation female hybrid and a male Bactrian camel can also produce a hybrid. Hybrids from other combinations tend to be bad-tempered or runts.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{dromedary}} probably {{evolved in}} the hotter, arid regions of western Asia from the Bactrian camel, which in turn was {{closely related to the}} earliest Old World camels. This hypothesis is supported {{by the fact that the}} dromedary foetus has two <b>humps,</b> while in the adult male an anterior vestigial hump is present. A jawbone of a dromedary that dated from 8,200 BC was found in Saudi Arabia on the southern coast of the Red Sea.|$|E

25|$|Male {{pink salmon}} and some sockeye salmon develop {{pronounced}} <b>humps</b> {{just before they}} spawn. These <b>humps</b> may have evolved because they confer species advantages. The <b>humps</b> make it less likely the salmon will spawn in the shallow water at margins of the streambed, which tend to dry out during low water flows or freeze in winter. Further, riffles can contain many salmon spawning simultaneously, as in {{the image on the}} right. Predators, such as bears, {{will be more likely to}} catch the more visually prominent humped males, with their <b>humps</b> projecting above the surface of the water. This may provide a protective buffer for the females.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} to investigate the turbulence field and flow characteristics in the separated flow through inclined <b>hump</b> in water structures in rectangular channel using Laser. To study the variation of the turbulence, energy loss, relative energy (efficiency) and relative depth with main parameters affecting the inclined <b>hump</b> These parameters include the <b>hump</b> angle, relative height, upstream Froude number, bottom slope. Non-dimensional design curves are provided to relate the turbulence intensities and flow characteristics. The results show that, the variation of the energy loss increases till of <b>hump</b> angle about 45 °. This rate of increase decreases about this value of angle of <b>hump.</b> The energy loss increases with the increasing of bed slope and relative height. The energy loss is quite high at a relative contraction of 0. 3. Also, the results clearly showed the dependence of the <b>hump</b> inclination angle on the turbulence intensities. For <b>hump</b> angle ≥ 20 °, the turbulence intensity in the separation zones was growing with increasing <b>hump</b> angles and the maximum was observed for <b>hump</b> inclination angles between 20 ° and 30 °. The results indicated that, the most significant differences in flow structures occurred with <b>hump</b> angle less than 45 °...|$|R
25|$|Speed <b>humps</b> {{are used}} in {{locations}} where low speeds are desired and suitable for the surrounding traffic environment. Speed <b>humps</b> are typically placed on residential roads and are not used on major roads, bus routes, or primary emergency response routes.

25|$|One {{problematic}} {{aspect of}} speed <b>humps</b> is {{their effect on}} emergency vehicles. Response time is slowed by 35 seconds per hump for fire trucks and fire engines and up to 10 seconds for ambulances with patients on board. Speed <b>humps</b> are thus usually not placed on primary response routes. Speed cushions may be placed on these routes instead.|$|E

25|$|Speed {{cushions}} {{have several}} distinct advantages over similar traffic calming devices. Many municipalities are challenged by opposition to speed <b>humps</b> and speed tables since they slow down emergency vehicles. Speed cushions {{address this problem}} by allowing larger vehicles to straddle the cushion without slowing down. This is also an advantage for buses, as lower floor vehicles can sometimes ground out on traditional <b>humps.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{speed hump}} (also called a road hump, or undulation, and speed ramp) is a rounded traffic calming device {{used to reduce}} vehicle speed and volume on {{residential}} streets. <b>Humps</b> are placed across the road to slow traffic and are often installed {{in a series of}} several <b>humps</b> to prevent cars from speeding before and after the hump. Common speed hump shapes are parabolic, circular, and sinusoidal.|$|E

25|$|Speed {{tables are}} {{effective}} in calming traffic on streets where the speed limit needs to be maintained rather than slowing cars more significantly.
