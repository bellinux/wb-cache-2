40|$|Farmers {{experience}} whole-body vibrations {{when they}} drive tractors. Among the various {{factors that influence}} the vibrations to which the driver is exposed are terrain roughness, tractor speed, tire type and pressure, rear axle width, and tractor seat <b>height</b> <b>above</b> the <b>ground.</b> In this paper the influence of tractor seat <b>height</b> <b>above</b> the <b>ground</b> on the lateral vibrations to which the tractor driver is exposed is studied {{by means of a}} geometrical and an experimental analysis. Both analyses show that: (i) lateral vibrations experienced by a tractor driver increase linearly with tractor-seat <b>height</b> <b>above</b> the ground; (ii) lateral vibrations to which the tractor driver is exposed can equal or exceed vertical vibrations; (iii) in medium-size tractors, a feasible 30 cm reduction in the height of the tractor seat, which represents only 15 % of its current height, will reduce the lateral vibrations by around 20 %; and (iv) vertical vibrations are scarcely influenced by tractor-seat <b>height</b> <b>above</b> the <b>ground.</b> The results suggest that manufacturers could increase the comfort of tractors by lowering tractor-seat <b>height</b> <b>above</b> the <b>ground,</b> which will reduce lateral vibrations...|$|R

500|$|The {{technical}} {{literature on}} air pollution dispersion is quite extensive and {{dates back to}} the 1930s and earlier. One of the early air pollutant plume dispersion equations was derived by Bosanquet and Pearson. Their equation did not assume Gaussian distribution nor did it include the effect of ground reflection of the pollutant plume. [...] Sir Graham Sutton derived an air pollutant plume dispersion equation in 1947 which did include the assumption of Gaussian distribution for the vertical and crosswind dispersion of the plume and also included the effect of ground reflection of the plume. [...] Under the stimulus provided by the advent of stringent environmental control regulations, there was an immense growth in the use of air pollutant plume dispersion calculations between the late 1960s and today. A great many computer programs for calculating the dispersion of air pollutant emissions were developed {{during that period of time}} and they were called [...] "air dispersion models". The basis for most of those models was the Complete Equation For Gaussian Dispersion Modeling Of Continuous, Buoyant Air Pollution Plumes [...] The Gaussian air pollutant dispersion equation requires the input of H which is the pollutant plume's centerline <b>height</b> <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> level—and H is the sum of Hs (the actual physical height of the pollutant plume's emission source point) plus ΔH (the plume rise due the plume's buoyancy).|$|E

40|$|Despite a vast body of {{research}} on balance and postural sway, there is little known about the impacts that varying <b>heights</b> <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> level have on an individual’s postural sway, whether in athletes or non-athletes. Knowing how athletic training affects an individual’s balance at varying heights may affect how that individual trains, particularly when the competition involves events <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> level or the performance of balance intensive activities. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine how postural sway differs between athletes and non-athletes, thirty years of age and older, when they are placed at varying <b>heights</b> <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> level. Methods: Participants were asked to stand on the Nintendo Wii Fit platform at ground level to take a control measurement. They were then asked to stand on platforms at three consecutive varying heights (1, 2, and 3 feet off of the ground) and to remain as stable and still as possible. Measurements of average displacement off center were taken at all four heights. Results: There was a significant difference between postural sway in athletes and non-athletes (P=. 00034). There was no significant difference of postural sway at the varying heights (P=. 77). Conclusion: These findings suggest that athletes control their postural sway more effectively than non-athletes at the varying heights. The findings may be beneficial in the development of training programs for individuals competing <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> level as well as for athletes participating in balance intensive activities...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHigh {{resolution}} large-eddy simulations (LES) {{were carried}} out to simulate the turbulent flow of the atmospheric boundary layer during an idealized strong-wind event in order to verify discrete gust models like the one-minus-cosine law which {{are used in the}} design process of aircraft and wind turbines. Furthermore existing gust models will be improved and new analytical approaches will be developed to approximate gusts more accurately. Mean gust shapes of the three wind speed components are calculated by means of virtual measurements of the turbulent wind speed at different <b>heights</b> <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> to analyze both the one- and two-dimensional characteristics of discrete gusts. One-dimensional results of the mean gust shapes show significant differences compared to the classical one-cosine gust model like a steeper increase and decrease as well as a rather constant middle part. Results obtained from previous mast measurements, however, show the same main gust characteristics as the present LES gusts. Two-dimensional mean gust shapes have not been calculated from field measurements yet. The results obtained from the LES data show elliptically shaped contours with different aspect ratios for different gust diameters and <b>heights</b> <b>above</b> <b>ground.</b> For both, one- and two-dimensional mean gust shapes, mathematical approximations are presented as alternative approach to the classical gust models {{in order to be able}} to reproduce the mean gust shapes for future applications...|$|R
