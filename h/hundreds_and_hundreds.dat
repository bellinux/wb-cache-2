25|$|Australia {{came and}} conquered in 1954–1955. After the Aussies made 515 {{in the first}} innings of the first Test, the Windies went down by 9 wickets. Then the Windies 382 was put in the shade by 600 for 9 {{declared}} by the visitors as the second Test was drawn. A low-scoring third Test saw Australia (257 and 133 for 2) beat the hosts (182 and 207) by 8 wickets. After Australia scored 668 in the fourth Test, the series was lost, although a double century from captain Denis Atkinson and a world-record stand for the seventh wicket allowed the Windies to reach 510 and draw the Test. The fifth Test saw the West Indies win the toss and bat. Walcott's 155 was the highest score of their 357. The Australians then batted and batted, in total for 245.4 overs in the 6-day Test, as they put on 758 for 8 declared, with five players making centuries. 319 in the West Indies' second innings left them defeated by an innings and 82 runs in the Test, and by three games to nil in the series. Walcott set records by scoring five <b>hundreds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>hundreds</b> in both innings of a match twice. A four-Test tour of New Zealand followed in February 1956. After two wins by an innings and one by 9 wickets, the Windies were surprised by the Kiwis in the fourth, dismissing them for 145 and 77 as they recorded their first ever Test win in their 45th Test.|$|E

Nasty, mean witches, and we'll get some great actresses for them as well." [...] Wirkola {{said he wanted to}} reinvent witches as villains: [...] "I do love Witches of Eastwick. We wanted to try to avoid the classical witch with the long nose stirring the pot. I really wanted them to be...dangerous, fast – they’re stronger than Hansel and Gretel...It’s a good basis for a villain." [...] He recalled that [...] "the most fun was finding their look and sound. For the main witches, we found one animal to represent all of them, like Muriel is a wolf. It just helped us find the witches. In some ways, it feels like they're the spawn of the dark places of nature. It should feel animalistic." [...] Asked if he was worried about [...] "this perception that it might be interpreted as sexist", Wirkola said, [...] "For me, that’s a classical villain from <b>hundreds</b> <b>and</b> <b>hundreds</b> of years ago. Yeah, I never worried about that, to be honest." [...] He added, [...] "People forget how truly dark and twisted those stories are.

2500|$|At the September 2009 {{annual meeting}} of the TPA, it was {{disclosed}} that Porter has broken its 11 p.m. curfew for landing at the airport three times in 2009, each time incurring a $5,000 fine. On one occasion, a Porter plane landed at the airport after-hours even after being advised by controllers to land at Pearson. According to Porter Airlines CEO Robert Deluce, [...] "You know <b>hundreds</b> <b>and</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>and</b> <b>hundreds</b> of flights come and go on a daily basis, so there are very, very few occasions where it happens. And there are also particular circumstances — and the circumstances are rare — to operate outside these normal times." [...] According to the TPA, they are powerless to stop Porter other than imposing fines, and that planes landing at the airport when no controllers are present is not a safety risk. TPA director Mark McQueen has requested that the NAV Canada personnel stay on-site until the last flight has landed, but NAV Canada has refused to do so.|$|E

That's... When he was one year old, the most evil wizard for <b>hundreds</b> <b>and</b> <b>hundreds</b> of years attempted to kill him.

2500|$|In 2010, sportswriter Joe Posnanski, {{writing for}} Sports Illustrated, named Paige as the hardest thrower {{in the history}} of baseball. He based this, in part, on the fact that: [...] "Joe DiMaggio would say that Paige was the best he ever faced. Bob Feller would say that Paige was the best he ever saw. Hack Wilson would say that the ball looked like a marble when it crossed the plate. Dizzy Dean would say that Paige's fastball made his own look like a changeup." [...] Posnanski further noted that: for most of his career Satchel Paige threw nothing but fastballs. Nothing. Oh, he named them {{different}} names—Bat Dodger, Midnight Rider, Midnight Creeper, Jump Ball, Trouble Ball—but essentially they were all fastballs. And he was still unhittable {{for the better part of}} 15 years. One pitch. It's a lot like Mariano Rivera, except he wasn't doing it for one inning at a time. He was pitching complete games day after day. That had to be some kind of incredible fastball.... perhaps the most precise pitcher in baseball history—he threw ludicrously hard.

2500|$|Jim Sullivan, {{the local}} Official IRA commander, {{feared that the}} troops would launch a bigger raid and {{instructed}} his men to move weapons out of the area. At about 6pm, Provisional IRA volunteers attacked the troops with improvised hand grenades. A number of soldiers suffered leg injuries. As more troops arrived, [...] "the Officials realized {{that they would have}} to fight" [...] and Sullivan ordered his men to confront the troops. An Official IRA source later said, [...] "The way we looked at it, we were not going to put up our hands and let them take the weaponry. We didn't want the confrontation, but we couldn't surrender". One source said that 60–70 Official IRA volunteers were involved, while another said 80–90. Each was armed with a rifle and at least one revolver. They exchanged fire with the troops and attacked them with grenades. Hundreds of local youths also pelted the troops with stones and petrol bombs. Journalist Simon Winchester later wrote:To anyone who experienced the battle, it was perfectly obvious that <b>hundreds</b> <b>and</b> <b>hundreds</b> of bullets were being fired by both sides – and yet the Army had the gall, when asked by reporters later in the weekend, to say that its soldiers fired only 15 shots in sum.

[...] It was here that [...] "Lili Marlene", the song broadcast from Radio Belgrade and which he had listened to night after night, from the desert to the mountain tops, finally ceased. [...] "Not long now," [...] he thought. The Partisan troops travelled through Arandjelovac and soon met up with the Red Army, who were being hailed as liberators. [...] Maclean noted that almost every {{one of them was a}} fighting soldier, and that their vehicles carried nothing but petrol and ammunition. For the rest, he presumed, they got from the enemy or the local people. [...] "We were witnessing a return to the administrative methods of Attila and Genghis Khan, and the results seemed to deserve careful attention." [...] In the last ten miles outside the capital, they passed <b>hundreds</b> <b>and</b> <b>hundreds</b> of corpses from the recent battle, and a neat stack of a hundred or more who appeared to have been executed. [...] When they reached the HQ of General Peko Dapčević, his chief of staff, who had only a vague notion of the geography of the city, took Maclean and Vivian Street out for a tour, through heavy shelling that he appeared oblivious to. [...] From the terrace of the Kalemegdan, the ancient fort in the middle of the city, they witnessed the withdrawal of German troops over the Danube to the suburb of Zemun. [...] Inexplicably, the Germans failed to blow up the bridge after the last of their troops were over it, allowing the Russians to follow only minutes behind. [...] Maclean, some time afterwards, found out the answer to this puzzle, comparing it to a fairytale. [...] An old schoolmaster, whose one experience of modern warfare was in the Balkan War of 1912, saw the charges being laid and knew how to disconnect them. He got a gold medal in 1912 and another for this initiative too.|$|E
