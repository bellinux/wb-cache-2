50|$|Violent conflicts, dictatorships and repressive regimes {{often have}} a lasting impact on societies. Dealing with the legacy of human rights {{violations}} and other crimes, also called transitional justice has thus become a central topic for swisspeace. The Foundation seeks to pursue a holistic approach that was jointly developed with the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA). This approach has four pillars: the right to know; the right to justice; the right to reparation; and the <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-recurrence</b> (see Figure 1). Since {{the creation of the}} Truth and Dignity Commission (TDC) in Tunisia in 2014, swisspeace has advised the TDC in questions regarding the access to state archives.|$|E

De Greiff's selection was announced {{at the conclusion of the}} 19th HRC session on 23 March 2012. De Greiff has lectured at Yale, Harvard, Columbia, Cornell, NYU, the European University Institute and other universities across Europe and Latin America. He has edited 10 books on justice and human rights and many articles on transitions to democracy, democratic theory, and the relationship between morality, politics, and law. A member of the board of editors of the International Journal of Transitional Justice, he holds dual Colombian and US citizenship.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTIn {{order to}} better {{understand}} the phenomenon of violation and recovery of trust in the context of exchanges between customers and companies, this theoretical essay aims to discuss the impact of the double deviation on trust, the possibility of trust recovery after double deviation and tactics {{that can be used to}} recover the trust after the occurrence of this phenomenon. Therefore, we discuss the difference between the violation of trust after the occurrence of service failure and the one occurred after unsuccessful service recovery (i. e., double deviation). It is believed that, because double deviation implies a severe violation of the existing trust, it can increase the erosion of trust generated after the original failure of service (simple deviation). Thereafter, we present research propositions, including the promises <b>of</b> <b>non-recurrence</b> <b>of</b> failures and apologies as tactics to regain the client’s trust after double deviation, based on the logic of using clues and the attribution theory. The research propositions listed in this essay are theoretically and empirically testable. As such, they provide solid grounds to initiate a research program on violation and recovery of client’s trust after unsuccessful failure recovery proceedings...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} UFT, a mixture of ftorafur and uracil in a ratio of 1 : 4, in preventing postoperative recurrence of bladder cancer, we performed a randomized controlled study with a non-medication group as control. UFT was given orally 400 mg a day for 6 months. Of 111 patients, 56 were given UFT and 55 were followed up without any medication. The non-recurrence rate in the group treated with UFT was 62. 8 % after 1 year and 36. 3 % after 2 years of follow up, {{and that of the}} control group was 45. 7 % and 39. 5 %, respectively. The rate <b>of</b> <b>non-recurrence</b> in the UFT group was significantly higher (p less than 0. 05) than that of the control group during the period of follow up for 2 years. The incidence of side effects was 6. 8 % in UFT patients. These results indicate the clinical usefulness of prophylactic administration of UFT for bladder cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|In 119 {{consecutive}} {{patients with}} {{invasive cervical cancer}} 92 variables of potential significance in predicting recurrence were determined before treatment. In 49 patients recurrent disease was diagnosed during follow-up after therapy. The investigated variables include: clinical data, routinely performed hematological and biochemical tests, histopathological data, oncofetal antigens, placental and pregnancy associated substances, serum levels of acute phase reactants, complement components, immunoglobulins and circulating immune complexes, and assays measuring the general immune competence of the patient. Thirty-three of the variables appeared to give statiatically significant differences between values of future recurrence and non-recurrence patients. Further selection {{was carried out by}} stepwise forward discriminant analysis. This selection resulted in a prognosis rule using a subset of 7 variables. Carcino-embryonic antigen and the complement component C 3 PA appeared to be the most powerful variables. Although the stage of disease was the third most important single variable, it did not add prognostic information, once CEA and C 3 PA were used. By applying the prognosis rule a probabilistic prediction is obtained for each patients. In about 60 % of the future recurrences and 40 % <b>of</b> the future <b>non-recurrence</b> patients, these predictions reached a high level of accuracy. It was argued that the prediction <b>of</b> <b>non-recurrence</b> does not warrant to change the treatment protocol at present.

40|$|The {{provisions}} of Art. 50 point 2 and Art. 52 para. 1 of the Act of 2 July 2004 on {{the freedom of}} economic activity refer to the “guarantee of proper performance of activity under concession” without determining, however, what such guarantee should really contain. This paper {{is an attempt to}} establish the meaning of the above term and this will be made based on other acts regulating activities under concession. It will also determine whether the provision <b>of</b> a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> proper performance of an activity under concession is identical with the satisfaction of the requirements needed to be fulfi lled in order to obtain a concession. Consequently, an analysis of the {{provisions of}} different acts regulating specifi c matters determining the conditions necessary to be met in order to conduct an economic activity has been made, including the provisions of other acts in which a concept of a “guarantee of proper performance of economic activity” has been used. The above analysis allows to draw a conclusion that the granting <b>of</b> a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> proper performance of activity under concession cannot be treated as satisfying the requirements of conducting economic activity, otherwise each entrepreneur satisfying the requirements of needed to conduct economic activity would be regarded as also giving a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> proper performance. What is more, giving a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> proper performance does not apply to activities under concession only. However, <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> proper performance in other types of economic activity are rare. Giving a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> proper performance of activity under concession means guaranteeing that the activity will also be properly performed in the future. A characteristic feature of an activity conducted under concession is that the future is predicted based on the actual state of affairs ascertaining satisfaction of the requirements of proper performance of an economic activity. Deliberations on a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> proper performance of economic activity may be carried out in the context <b>of</b> a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> proper performance of a given profession. This is done {{in the second part of}} the paper. However, it must be noted that not all elements identifi ed in judicial decisions as those constituting a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> proper performance of a profession, may be directly referred to when it comes to the performance of an economic activity. Professional ethic or the moral qualities of an entrepreneur may not constitute a premise indicating the absence <b>of</b> a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> proper performance of a concession activity...|$|R
