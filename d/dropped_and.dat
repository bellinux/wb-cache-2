While Mister Twister went down the second <b>drop</b> <b>and</b> into the helix right away, Twister II leaves the second <b>drop</b> <b>and</b> goes up a double up hill, then makes another <b>drop</b> <b>and</b> rise, and enters the helix near the station.

30|$|Here, {{we focus}} on {{verification}} of <b>drop</b> <b>and</b> cut-through operations and the reconfigurability of the proposed ROADM because insertion of wavelength channels and time slots for add operation can be also achieved by setting up almost the same optical system for <b>drop</b> <b>and</b> cut-through operations.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the notion}} of {{declarative}} goals as used in agent programming is central. Declarative goals describe desirable states and are updated during the execution of an agent. These goal dynamics are analyzed by distinguishing and formalizing various notions of goal <b>dropping</b> <b>and</b> goal adoption. Furthermore, possible motivations for an agent to drop or adopt goals are identified. Based on these motivations, we define specific mechanisms for implementing <b>dropping</b> <b>and</b> adoption. We show how these mechanisms {{are related to the}} general definitions of <b>dropping</b> <b>and</b> adoption...|$|R

He found a successful market in the South, where demand was high. His company, newly named the Planters' Hoe Company, was a considerable success. However, as the nation came closer to civil war, demand <b>dropped</b> <b>and</b> sales in the South became impossible. The factory was closed in 1861, not only due to poor sales, but because Allen enlisted in the Union Army.|$|E
