40|$|The Curriculum Board {{in charge}} of {{drafting}} {{the changes in the}} existent educational programmes of foreign language - English, French, Italian and German - acguisition for adults has carried out a survey among foreign language teachers. The Board wanted to establish the views of the teachers concerning the admission reguirements and the target groups, knowledge standards, contents, criteria of knowledge evaluation and testing, implementation of programmes in various institutions, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes,</b> conditions for implementation, etc. The results of the survey show that the existent programmes are judged as rather good by the teachers. However, this positive evaluation mainly refers to the conrent, duration and admission requirements; the teachers also pointed out some negative aspects of the programmes, namely inadequately defined knowledge standards and related eva luation criteria. On the basis of the survey it can be concluded that the certificates issued by different institutions, where programmes are carried out, do not reflect the same level of knowledge. Unfortunately, it can also be concluded that (too) many teachers are not familiar with the education programmes they are supposed to carry out...|$|E

Hence it examined {{the concept of}} ICT {{as the use of}} computer based information system and communication systems to process, store and transmit data. Entrepreneurship as skills acquired to establish a business outfit. The objectives of entrepreneurship include but not limited to identify and solve problems using critical and creative thinking. Examine the link between science, vocational and technical education, small business and entrepreneurship. Also discussed are the role of entrepreneurship in economic development such as economic and support facilities linkages, rural saving mobilization, utilization of local resources and rural materials, generalization of employment opportunities. It also highlighted some of the agencies for promoting entrepreneurship education such as small and medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria, Industrial Development Centres, National Development Programme etc. ICT as a tool for entrepreneurship was highlighted. Problems of entrepreneurship education such as absence of mentorship, short <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes,</b> inadequate funding and capacity are explained.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, teacher {{education}} in Ireland has experienced radical reconceptualization and restructuring at both initial teacher education [ITE] and induction levels, with reform of continuous professional development {{now in the}} planning phase. The establishment of the Teaching Council (2006) as a statutory, regulatory body, with {{a role in the}} review and accreditation of teacher education, increased the visibility of and policy focus on teacher education. Significant reform of initial teacher education was announced in 2011 that included both an extension of the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> and, most notably, the period the student teachers were to be engaged in school-based professional development. This increased period has been accompanied by a shift in the understanding of what is involved in practicum and implies a redefinition of the respective roles of the university and the school, {{and the development of a}} new form of partnership between both agencies. The period of induction and probation has also become an area of reform with an emphasis on school-based coaching and the evaluation of newly qualified teachers, which devolves decisions on teachers’ full recognition and membership of the profession, to principals and colleagues. This shift, which changes the established approach to induction for primary level teachers, has resulted in the withdrawal of cooperation with this policy by the main teacher union and to the implementation process being stymied. Both policy developments bring the concept of partnership within Irish education into sharp focus: a partnership between schools and universities in ITE, but also partnership in policy development and implementation in the case of induction...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Chronic {{non-specific}} {{low back}} pain (NSCLBP) is a common low back condition affecting {{a large proportion of}} the population suffering from {{low back pain}} (LBP). Exercise therapy is recommended as the first line treatment for NSCLBP but no type of exercise has been found to be more effective than another in improving pain and function outcomes. Low back pain trials have compared heterogeneous exercise types to date. Pilates mat classes are a popular form of exercise taught by therapists. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of an eight-week supervised Pilates mat programme with those of a similar non-supervised home exercise programme with regard to pain intensity, function, medication use, health related quality of life, adherence, and participant satisfaction with such exercise programmes in treating NSCLBP. A randomised control trial was done to compare the effect of a supervised Pilates at programme with a non-supervised home programme of similar exercises. The programmes were comparable for both the type of exercise and the participation <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> (per week) and included the same fourteen exercises with gradual progressions. The Pilates classes were held twice a week for a 45 minute class and the home programme required doing the exercises for 30 minutes, three times a week, for an eight-week period. All participants were women who had been suffering from NSCLBP for longer than six weeks and who had volunteered to participate, or were referred by a therapist. The participants were screened and randomly allocated to the respective groups: a supervised exercise group (SEG) and a home exercise group (HEG). All the individual sessions and the supervised classes were held at a multi-disciplinary centre, which housed both a private physiotherapy practice and a Pilates studio. Outcome measures were measured at baseline, four weeks, eight weeks and 12 weeks by an assessor who was blinded to group allocation. The primary outcomes of pain and function were measured using the Pain Intensity Numeric Rating Scale (PINRS) and the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) respectively. Change in medication was measured as a percentage change in medication; mobility of the pelvis and lumbar spine was measured using the fingertip-to-floor (FTF) test; health-related quality of life was assessed using the EQ- 5 D questionnaire, and the confidence to perform certain tasks was measured using the pain self-efficacy questionnaire (PSEQ). Additionally, patient satisfaction was measured at eight weeks using the Better Backs Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire, and adherence was measured by calculating a percentage of the maximum adherence...|$|E

40|$|Several {{decades of}} conflict, {{rebellion}} and unrest severely weakened {{civil society in}} parts of Colombia. Desarollo y Paz is the umbrella term {{used to describe the}} set of locally-led initiatives that aim at addressing this problem through initiatives to promote sustainable economic development and community cohesion and action. In this paper we analyse the findings from a series of 'public good' games that were conducted between November 2005 and February 2007 in 104 municipalities in rural and urban Colombia with mainly poor participants. The data covers municipalities both with ('treatment') and without ('control') a PRDP in place, and within the 'treatment' municipalities, both beneficiaries and non beneficiaries of the PRDP initiative. The data for 'control' municipalities was collected as part of the evaluation of Familias en Accion (FeA), Colombia's conditional cash transfer programme. The game is structured as a typical free-rider problem with the act of contributing to the 'public good' (a collective money pot) being always dominated by non-contribution. We interpret contribution as an act consistent {{with a high degree of}} social capital. Potentially endogenous selection into the programme makes identifying programme effects difficult but we find strong and suggestive evidence that exposure to PRDPs improve social capital and that this extends beyond direct beneficiaries <b>of</b> the <b>programme.</b> In particular, the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>programme</b> operation and the proportion <b>of</b> <b>programme</b> beneficiaries in a game session increase contribution to the public good, suggesting that in order to have a major impact the programme must be sufficiently 'intensive'. ...|$|R
