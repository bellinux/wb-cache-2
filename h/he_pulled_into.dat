2500|$|In May 2010, it was {{reported}} that a British sailor had saved a group of [...] "desperate and starving" [...] islanders after chancing upon them on his way to Australia. When Alex Bond, from Penryn, Cornwall, docked at Kanton Island — the only habitable island in the Phoenix Islands chain, northeast of Australia — he found that its 24 residents were destitute after a supply ship failed to bring them food four months before. He contacted the Falmouth, England, coast guard using his satellite phone, and they arranged for the US coast guard to send supplies from Honolulu, Hawaii. The 10 children and 14 adults were surviving on fish and coconuts when <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> a lagoon near the small island. Bond reportedly works for UK-based disaster relief charity ShelterBox, which provides emergency aid to people in need.|$|E
60|$|Such a {{thing was}} unheard of. Jacob Kent {{was making the}} fire, {{chopping}} wood, packing water--doing menial tasks for a guest! When Jim Cardegee left Dawson, it was with his head filled with the iniquities of this roadside Shylock; and all along the trail his numerous victims had added to the sum of his crimes. Now, Jim Cardegee, with the sailor's love for a sailor's joke, had determined, when <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the cabin, to bring its inmate down a peg or so. That he had succeeded beyond expectation {{he could not help}} but remark, though he was in the dark as to the part the gash on his cheek had played in it. But while he could not understand, he saw the terror it created, and resolved to exploit it as remorselessly as would any modern trader a choice bit of merchandise.|$|E
60|$|The {{spring of}} the year was at hand when Grey Beaver {{finished}} his long journey. It was April, and White Fang was a year old when <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the home villages and was loosed from the harness by Mit-sah. Though a long way from his full growth, White Fang, next to Lip-lip, was the largest yearling in the village. Both from his father, the wolf, and from Kiche, he had inherited stature and strength, and already he was measuring up alongside the full-grown dogs. But he had not yet grown compact. His body was slender and rangy, and his strength more stringy than massive, His coat was the true wolf-grey, and to all appearances he was true wolf himself. The quarter-strain of dog he had inherited from Kiche had left no mark on him physically, though it had played its part in his mental make-up.|$|E

60|$|With Circle City in {{prospect}} and {{the last}} ice crumbling under his runners, Montana Kid {{took advantage of the}} lengthening days and travelled his dogs late and early. Further, he had but little doubt that the owner of the dogs in question had taken his trail, and he wished to make American territory before the river broke. But by the afternoon of the third day it became evident that he had lost in his race with spring. The Yukon was growling and straining at its fetters. Long detours became necessary, for the trail had begun to fall through into the swift current beneath, while the ice, in constant unrest, was thundering apart in great gaping fissures. Through these and through countless airholes, the water began to sweep {{across the surface of the}} ice, and by the time <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> a woodchopper's cabin on the point of an island, the dogs were being rushed off their feet and were swimming more often than not. He was greeted sourly by the two residents, but he unharnessed and proceeded to cook up.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} few laps, Carter slid down the standings, and on lap 6, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the pits with a failed oil pump. He became the second polesitter to finish last (33rd) after Cliff Woodbury in 1929.|$|E
50|$|He {{left the}} General Staff of the 7th {{military}} region and on 1 November 1936 {{was assigned to}} the 60th Infantry Regiment to complete his commission. He commanded CA2, machine-gunners which <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> a remarkable team. He relinquished command of the 60th Infantry on 16 April 1937 and was entered in the competition to be named an officer of the Légion d'Honneur.|$|E
5000|$|Parnell finally {{arrives in}} L.A., {{but he is}} unable to meet up with his waiting UFO compatriots because of a team of {{government}} agents led by a woman with a metal hand. When <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>into</b> a gas station, the Rodriguez brothers (competitors of Helping Hand) take the car. They stop for sodas because the car's trunk is so hot. While they are out of the car, a trio of Otto's punk friends, who are on a crime spree (what they call [...] "doing crimes"), steal the Malibu.|$|R

50|$|Giancarlo Fisichella's engine {{began to}} smoke during lap two, and <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the pits to retire. However, as he applied the pit lane speed limiter, he felt power return, and was waved through by his team. But the {{resurgence}} was short-lived, {{and he was}} back in the pits on lap four to retire. On lap three, Narain Karthikeyan's car suffered an electrical failure that looked similar to Christian Klien's.|$|E
5000|$|Darrow {{told the}} news media that <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the {{commuter}} lot to meet a friend. When the officer asked him for identification, Darrow said he didn't immediately present it because he believed the officer stopped him without probable cause. After the video gained popularity on the Internet, Kuehnlein was suspended without pay. In response, St. George Police Chief Scott Uhrig said, [...] "I was very displeased when I saw the actions on the video." ...|$|E
5000|$|For {{the next}} ten days Lincoln {{traveled}} widely throughout the North, including stops in Indianapolis, Columbus, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Buffalo, Albany, New York City, and south to Philadelphia, where {{on the afternoon of}} February 21 <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> Kensington Station. Lincoln took an open carriage to the Continental Hotel, with almost 100,000 spectators waiting {{to catch a glimpse of}} the president-elect. There he met Mayor Alexander Henry, and delivered some remarks to the crowd outside from a hotel balcony. [...] Lincoln continued on to Harrisburg.|$|E

Quid notices {{a man in}} a green van {{checking}} in with a female hitchhiker he had passed earlier because the trucking company policy forbids it. Nevertheless, Quid is upset at the man for taking the last room in the motel and picking up the attractive hitcher. In the motel, the hitcher strums a guitar naked on the bed, while the unidentified man unpacks a new guitar string. He winds the string around his gloved hands and uses it to strangle the woman.|$|R

5000|$|Danny Kladis was {{the first}} driver to {{complete}} a run during the afternoon, at a relatively slow pace of 118.890 mph. He slipped down the standings as the day progressed, but his speed would hold up and he barely held on to qualify 33rd. Late in the afternoon, Charles Van Acker completed a run at 115.666 mph to fill the field at 33 cars. Buddy Rusch was now [...] "on the bubble", the slowest car in the field. Steve Truchan was the next car out, but <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the pits after only three laps.|$|E
5000|$|Pafko {{grew up in}} Boyceville, Wisconsin. [...] The {{small village}} {{did not have a}} {{baseball}} team. Pafko was signed as a 19-year-old by the Class D baseball team in nearby Eau Claire. Pafko learned about the interest from team manager Ivy Griffin while working on his father's farm.

50|$|Carvel {{began selling}} ice cream {{out of his}} truck in 1929 in Hartsdale, New York. In 1934, on Memorial Day weekend, his truck had a flat tire—so <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> a parking lot next to a pottery store and began selling his melting ice cream to vacationers driving by. The owner of the pottery store allowed Carvel to use {{electricity}} from his store, so he opened his parked truck for ice cream sales. Within two days he had sold his entire supply of ice cream and concluded that he could increase his profits by working from a fixed location.|$|E
50|$|Of all his operations, {{his most}} {{successful}} was a root beer stand called Top Hat that he opened in 1953, which brought regular profits of 20% annually. While driving near the Texas-Louisiana border, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> a fast food restaurant that used {{a series of}} intercoms at each parking spot to allow customers to place orders directly from their cars. Smith obtained {{the design of the}} communication system and put it in place at Top Hat, allowing customers to place orders and have them delivered to their car within three minutes by carhops on roller skates.|$|E
5000|$|Not long after, Greene {{found an}} unexploded bomb {{in his car}} when <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> a Collinwood service station for gas. The {{explosive}} was wired improperly and failed to detonate. Greene disassembled the bomb himself, removed the dynamite, and brought {{the rest of the}} package to the Cleveland police lieutenant, Edward Kovacic. Kovacic offered him police protection, but he refused. He also refused to hand over the bomb, telling him, [...] "I'm going to send this back to the old bastard that sent it to me." [...] Suspecting that Birns was behind it, Greene decided to retaliate.|$|E

5000|$|Assistant Chief Constable Rebecca Fenning (Pippa Haywood) (A Sweeter Lazarus - Above the Law): Rebecca Fenning is the {{complete}} opposite of Victor Raymond - she's not frightened of chasing a suspect, regularly allows Dalziel {{to break the}} rules, and even compliments him {{with a bottle of}} single malt for a great result on a case. She's not afraid to tell the big wigs above her where to go - if she's onto a suspect, she's determined to catch them. Her relationship with Dalziel blossoms much more than that of her predecessor, so much that Dalziel is not even a tiny bit scared when <b>he's</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> her office for a quick telling off. Although only with the team very briefly, her effect on Dalziel is noticeable.|$|R
50|$|Over Memorial Day {{weekend of}} 1934, Tom Carvel, {{the founder of}} the Carvel brand and franchise, {{suffered}} a flat tire in his ice cream truck in Hartsdale, New York. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> a parking lot and began selling his melting ice cream to vacationers driving by. Within two days he had sold his entire supply of ice cream and concluded that both a fixed location and soft (as opposed to hard) frozen desserts were potentially good business ideas. In 1936, Carvel opened his first store on the original broken down truck site and developed a secret soft serve ice cream formula as well as patented super low temperature ice cream machines.|$|E
5000|$|There was {{drama in}} the final four laps. On lap 77, Andretti's engine blew and laid oil in turn 9 as <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the pits. Patrese spun his Shadow in the turn 9 oil and into the second Hesketh of Rupert Keegan, which had crashed earlier in the race and had been left {{on the side of the}} track. Vittorio Brambilla then hit the oil and also spun his Surtees, {{collecting}} the wreckages of Keegan's and Patrese's cars. Danny Ongais was next in the Interscope Penske, but was able to continue. Finally Villeneuve spun, staying on the track only to break a driveshaft trying to pull away and retiring.|$|E
50|$|At about 3:30 p.m., Willy T. Ribbs finally {{returned}} to the track to shake down the car. He ran a few practice laps, and was quickly over 214 mph. At 5:05 p.m., the team placed {{the car in the}} tech line, and prepared to qualify. With much anticipation from fans and the media, Ribbs miraculously completed the four-lap qualifying run at a speed of 217.358 mph, the fastest laps he had run all month. On his cool-down lap, an ecstatic Ribbs hoisted himself partially out of his seat, waving and cheering with both hands out of the cockpit as <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the pits. Ribbs bumped former winner Tom Sneva, and was comfortably in the field.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look out!" [...] said Leonard, [...] "they {{are going}} to open fire. Under the earthwork, every man of you!" [...] And seizing Juanna who was {{standing}} near, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> her down <b>into</b> cover.|$|R
50|$|Jack Darke died 16 September 1897 when <b>he</b> was <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> {{the buzz}} {{saw at the}} Gold Rush sawmill. There is {{considerable}} speculation as to the exact circumstances surrounding Darke’s death. While town records from the time report that Jack died while attempting to burn down the sawmill, Gold Rush town folklore suggests a more complicated and suspicious set of events.|$|R
5000|$|A {{housekeeper}} finds a {{joint in}} Jesse's room {{and his parents}} kick him out. It turns out the joint belonged to Jake and he thanks Jesse for taking the fall for him then asks for the joint back. However, Jesse crumbles it up and throws it onto the pavement, dismissing it as [...] "skunk-weed anyway." [...] Walter suffers a coughing attack while driving and coughs up blood. As <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>into</b> a gas station, <b>he</b> notices Ken <b>pull</b> up (his car being readily identifiable by the personalized license plate [...] "KEN WINS"). When Ken leaves his car unattended, an angry Walter takes a squeegee, pops open Ken's hood, and shorts the car battery with it. The engine subsequently overheats and the car explodes as Walter walks back to his car. He then calmly drives away, leaving an exasperated Ken.|$|R
