25|$|Portugal uses tax and {{transfer}} payments to increase equality between high-income <b>earners</b> and the low-income <b>earners</b> in the country. There are significant progressive characteristics of income taxes in Portugal. The government tax policy {{ensures that the}} high-income <b>earners</b> face higher taxes in comparison to low-income <b>earners</b> which have enabled the low-income <b>earners</b> {{to be able to}} stimulate demand for goods and services in the country economy. The high-income <b>earners</b> pay roughly three times the amount paid by the low-income <b>earners.</b> This approach has been significant in reducing income inequality through means of redistribution.|$|R
40|$|This paper tests {{whether the}} stock market overreacts to extreme earnings, by {{examining}} firms' stock returns over the thirty-six months subsequent to extreme earnings years.

This suggests that size, and not investor overreaction to earnings, is responsible for the "overreaction" phenomenon, the tendency for prior period losers to outperform prior period winners in the subsequent period.

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Iron Curtain and the {{economic}} and political barriers that followed, central and eastern European countries with local mushroom harvesting traditions, such as Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, developed into exporters of porcini, concentrating primarily on the Italian market.

Picking B.edulis has become an annual seasonal income <b>earner</b> and pastime in countries like Bulgaria, especially for many Roma communities and the unemployed.

40|$|There {{are three}} {{major sources of}} housing {{provision}} in Nigeria; namely public, private and popular sectors.

Two public housing schemes in Ado-Ekiti; namely, the Federal Low Cost Housing Estate and the State Housing Estate were studied. The research findings show glaringly that low-income <b>earners</b> were almost schemed out regarding access to the buildings.

5|$|During his career, Russell {{was one of}} {{the first}} big earners in NBA basketball. His 1956 rookie {{contract}} was worth $24,000, only fractionally smaller than the $25,000 of top <b>earner</b> Bob Cousy. In contrast to other Celtics, who had to work in the offseason to maintain their standard of living (Heinsohn sold insurance, Gene Guarilia was a professional guitar player, Cousy ran a basketball camp, and Auerbach invested in plastics and a Chinese restaurant), Russell never had to work part-time. When Wilt Chamberlain became the first NBA player to earn $100,000 in salary in 1965, Russell went to Auerbach and demanded a $100,001 salary, which he promptly received. For his promotion to coach the Celtics paid Russell an annual salary of $25,000 which was in addition to his salary as a player; although the salary was touted in the press as a record for an NBA coach, it is unclear whether Russell's continued $100,001 salary as a player was included in the calculation.|$|E
