40|$|In {{philosophy}} of mind, desire is an also-ran {{when it comes}} to theorizing about mental states- all the attention is on belief, (visual) perceptual experience, and pain.

It has not been recognized that we might have conflicting behavioral dispositions because of an over-focus on mental states that are usually held together coherently: beliefs.
