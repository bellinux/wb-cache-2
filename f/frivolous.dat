5|$|The {{argument}} that only corporations {{are subject to}} federal income tax, and variations of this argument, have been officially identified as legally <b>frivolous</b> federal tax return positions for purposes of the $5,000 <b>frivolous</b> tax return penalty imposed under Internal Revenue Code section 6702(a).|$|E
5|$|The {{argument}} that a person's income is not taxed {{when the person}} rejects or renounces United States citizenship because the person {{claims to be a}} citizen exclusively of a state, and variations of this argument, have been officially identified as legally <b>frivolous</b> federal tax return positions for purposes of the $5,000 <b>frivolous</b> tax return penalty imposed under Internal Revenue Code section 6702(a).|$|E
5|$|Along with Book of Lost Tales, Douglas Anderson {{shows that}} in The Hobbit, Tolkien again {{includes}} both the more serious 'medieval' type of elves, such as Elrond and the Wood-elf king, and <b>frivolous</b> elves, such as those at Rivendell.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{traditionally}} dismissed Anne as a lightweight queen, <b>frivolous</b> and self-indulgent. However, recent reappraisals acknowledge Anne's assertive independence and, in particular, her dynamic significance as a {{patron of the}} arts during the Jacobean age.|$|E
5|$|Stossel {{has criticized}} {{government}} programs for being inefficient, wasteful, and harmful. He has also criticized the American legal system, opining {{that it provides}} lawyers and vexatious litigators the incentive to file <b>frivolous</b> lawsuits indiscriminately. Stossel contends that these suits often generate more wealth for lawyers than for deserving clients, stifle innovation and personal freedoms, and cause harm to private citizens, taxpayers, consumers and businesses. Although Stossel concedes that some lawsuits are {{necessary in order to}} provide justice to people genuinely injured by others with greater economic power, he advocates the adoption in the U.S. of the English rule as one method to reduce the more abusive or <b>frivolous</b> lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|Waters v. Commissioner (taxpayer’s {{argument}} that income taxation of wages is unconstitutional {{was rejected by}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit; taxpayer required to pay damages for filing <b>frivolous</b> suit).|$|E
5|$|Asuma is a male wizard with a <b>frivolous</b> {{personality}} {{and is the}} director of Kamisaid Magic Academy. He likes using magic to surprise others, such as making flowers and small birds appear out of nowhere. His sacrifice for magic is that he ages quickly. For example, when Misaki was saved by him, she was surprised he had aged a few years in one day.|$|E
5|$|For Braun the {{manuscript}} was fortuitous. Initially {{the sales of}} Max and Moritz were slow, but sales figures improved after the 1868 second edition. Overall there were 56 editions and more than 430,000 copies sold up to Busch's death in 1908. Despite at first being ignored by critics, teachers in the 1870s described Max and Moritz as <b>frivolous</b> and an undesirable influence on the moral development of young people.|$|E
5|$|I {{might have}} adduced for this same purpose the {{differences}} between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear <b>frivolous.</b>|$|E
5|$|In her summation, however, Karros manages an {{effective}} damage control, pointing {{out to the}} jury that the case in question was not the past record of Varrick but solely the effects of Krayoxx, and that Finley & Figg has in no way proven a connection between Krayoxx {{and the death of}} their client's late husband. The jury is convinced and renders a very quick verdict totally rejecting the Krayoxx tort claim and giving Varrick their expected vindication. Still, Zinc's former colleagues of Rogan Rothberg express their grudging respect for his spirited cross-examination, and even help Zinc get even with an obnoxious blogger who had been ceaselessly maligning Zinc and Zinc's wife. Moreover, Karros keeps her promise and agrees to drop all the <b>frivolous</b> lawsuit and legal malpractice proceedings against Finley & Figg. Varrick has no special grudge against this small firm, though they intend to settle accounts with their old foe Alisandros and extract from him big sums on a <b>frivolous</b> lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|A {{defendant}} {{does not}} have a right to appointed counsel {{if he or she is}} not sentenced to actual imprisonment and could not have been sentenced for more than one year, even if that conviction is later used to enhance sentencing for another crime, or even if the revocation of probation may result in actual imprisonment. Nor does the defendant have the right to appointed counsel to raise <b>frivolous</b> arguments on direct appeal, or to raise any arguments on habeas or other collateral appeal, even if facing execution.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte's brother succeeded {{their father}} as Emperor Wilhelm II in 1888, {{increasing}} her social influence. Throughout her brother's reign, {{she was known}} for her mischief-making, and spent her life in between bouts of illness, in <b>frivolous</b> and extravagant pursuits. She became Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen in 1914, only for her husband to lose his title {{with the end of}} World War I in 1918. Charlotte died the following year {{of a heart attack in}} Baden-Baden. She had suffered from a lifetime of ill-health. Most historians now believe she had porphyria, a genetic disease that afflicted other members of the British Royal Family.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, the Temenggong {{delegated}} Abu Bakar, then an eighteen-year-old youth, {{to assist}} him in negotiation efforts against Sultan Ali, who was making <b>frivolous</b> attempts to claim sovereignty rights over Johor. As the Temenggong aged, he gradually delegated his state administrative duties to Abu Bakar. During this period, several British officers praised of Abu Bakar's excellent diplomatic skills, as mentioned in William Napier's diaries, who was the senior law agent of Singapore. Napier had accompanied Abu Bakar to fetch Tengku Teh, {{the mother of the}} deposed Sultan of Lingga, Mahmud Muzaffar Shah to Johor shortly after her son began to exert sovereignty claims over Pahang.|$|E
5|$|It {{has already}} proven {{difficult}} {{to be recognized as}} having standing when a fix is not used for a controversial appointment. The courts have dismissed suits contesting the appointments of Justice Hugo Black (Ex parte Levitt, 302 U.S. 633 (1937)) and Judge Abner Mikva (McClure v. Carter, 454 U.S. 1025 (1981)). Black and Mikva were members of Congress (Black of the Senate, Mikva of the House of Representatives) prior to appointment were appointed without a Saxbe fix. In both cases, the courts held that the plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the appointment. Other than these cases, most attempts to gain standing have been considered <b>frivolous</b> lawsuits brought by fringe groups.|$|E
5|$|Leigh {{appeared}} with Robert Taylor, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan in A Yank at Oxford (1938), {{which was the}} first of her films to receive attention in the United States. During production, she developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable, partly because she disliked her secondary role but mainly because her petulant antics seemed to be paying dividends. After dealing with the threat of a lawsuit brought over a <b>frivolous</b> incident, Korda, however, instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour did not improve. Her next role was in Sidewalks of London, also known as St. Martin's Lane (1938), with Charles Laughton.|$|E
5|$|The Count of Artois did {{not join}} the court-in-exile in Hartwell, preferring to {{continue}} his <b>frivolous</b> life in London. Louis's friend the Count of Avaray left Hartwell for Madeira in 1809, and died there in 1811. Louis replaced Avaray with the Comte de Blacas as his principal political advisor. Queen Marie Joséphine died on 13 November 1810. That same winter, Louis suffered a particularly severe case of gout, which was a recurring problem for him at Hartwell, {{and he had to}} be put in a wheelchair.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of standing prevents applicants from burdening {{the court with}} <b>frivolous</b> or vexatious claims. This minimizes disruption in the administrative process. When an administrative decision by a public authority is challenged, implementation of {{the decision by the}} authority may be delayed. Therefore, the courts want to restrict access to applicants who have a genuine interest in challenging the decision. Furthermore, since the courts' resources are limited, restricting access to genuine claims ensures that judicial resources are appropriately allocated.|$|E
5|$|A Peronist, Kirchner handled {{political}} power as Peronist leaders have traditionally done. He nevertheless sought to portray himself as being different from previous Peronist leaders. He made {{frequent use of}} controversies with other political or social forces and the polarization of public opinion, which became characteristic of his political style. This strategy was used against the financial sector, the military and police, foreign countries, international bodies, newspapers, and Duhalde himself {{with varying degrees of}} success. Kirchner sought to generate an image contrasting with those of former presidents Carlos Menem and Fernando de la Rúa. Menem was seen as <b>frivolous</b> and De la Rúa as doubtful, so Kirchner tried to be seen as serious and determined.|$|E
5|$|Adams filed a countersuit, {{claiming}} {{the case was}} in poor taste and <b>frivolous,</b> and that, as author of the Nancy Drew series, she retained the rights to her work. Although Adams had written many of the titles after 1953, and edited others, she {{claimed to be the}} author of all of the early titles. In fact, she had rewritten the older titles and was not their original author. When Mildred Benson was called to testify about her work for the Syndicate, Benson's role in writing the manuscripts of early titles was revealed in court with extensive documentation, contradicting Adams' claims to authorship. The court ruled that Grosset had the rights to publish the original series as they were in print in 1980, but did not own characters or trademarks. Furthermore, any new publishers chosen by Adams were completely within their rights to print new titles.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Marge wake on New Year's Day with hangovers {{after the}} family's New Year's Eve celebration. As Homer {{takes out the}} garbage, Chief Wiggum, Eddie, and Lou arrive and issue him {{multiple}} citations and fines - the result of recently passed, <b>frivolous</b> laws intended to bring in revenue for the city when broken. Taking Moe's suggestion that he bribe a city official to clear up the fines, Homer leaves a sack full of cash on the official's desk but is promptly arrested, convicted, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Wiggum takes pity on Homer and tells him to meet with an FBI agent, who offers to reduce the sentence if Homer will go undercover in the prison to investigate Fat Tony, who is also serving time along with his top henchmen.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013, hip-hop artist Daz Dillinger {{issued a}} {{cease and desist}} letter to Rockstar Games and Take Two Interactive for {{allegedly}} using two of his songs without authorisation. American television personality Karen Gravano of the reality television programme Mob Wives filed suit against Rockstar Games in February 2014 in allegation that a character in the game is based on her likeness and story and was depicted without her consent. Rockstar filed to dismiss Gravano's lawsuit in April, and stated that the allegations are foreclosed by the First Amendment. In July, actress Lindsay Lohan also filed a lawsuit, claiming elements in the game, including the Lacey Jonas character, were influenced by her image, voice and clothing line without permission. Rockstar responded in court papers that sought a dismissal of the case, saying that the case was <b>frivolous</b> and filed for publicity purposes. In 2016, both lawsuits were dismissed.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, 2011the {{day before}} Chandler's 65th birthdayFlorida Governor Rick Scott signed Chandler's death warrant. His {{execution}} {{was set for}} November 15, 2011, at 4:00pm. His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any <b>frivolous</b> appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He is not going to make a scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that I can find to try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Neuroscientist and {{psychologist}} Pascal Wallisch {{states that}} while inherently ambiguous stimuli {{have been known}} to vision science for many years, this is the first such stimulus in the colour domain that was {{brought to the attention of}} science by social media. He attributes differential perceptions to differences in illumination and fabric priors, but also notes that the stimulus is highly unusual insofar as the perception of most people does not switch. If it does, it does so only on very long time scales, which is highly unusual for bistable stimuli, so perceptual learning might be at play. In addition, he says that discussions of this stimulus are not <b>frivolous,</b> as the stimulus is both of interest to science and a paradigmatic case of how different people can sincerely see the world differently, an acknowledgement of which is a precondition for world peace. Daniel Hardiman-McCartney of the College of Optometrists stated that the picture was ambiguous, suggesting that the illusion was caused by a strong yellow light shining onto the dress, and human perception of the colours of the dress and light source by comparing them with other colours and objects in the picture. The philosopher Barry C. Smith compared the phenomenon with Ludwig Wittgenstein and the rabbit–duck illusion.|$|E
5|$|His view (part of a {{tradition}} {{that goes back to}} J. J. Müller, who advanced Marius' claims as early as 1870, and supported by modern scholars such as André Chastagnol) was vigorously contested by Ronald Syme, who theorized that virtually all the identifiable citations from Marius Maximus are essentially <b>frivolous</b> interpolations into the main narrative source, which he postulated was a different Latin author whom he styled 'Ignotus ("the unknown one"), the good biographer'. His theory argued, firstly, that as Marius wrote a sequel to the Lives of the Twelve Caesars, his work covered the reigns from Nerva to Elagabalus; consequently, this would not have included a biography of Lucius Verus, even though the biography of that Princeps in the History is mainly of good quality. Secondly, that 'Ignotus' only went up to Caracalla, as is revealed by the inferior and mostly fictitious biography of Macrinus. Finally, that the composer of the Historia Augusta wrote the lives of the emperors through to the Life of Caracalla (including Lucius Verus) using Ignotus as his main source, and supplementing with Marius Maximus on occasion. It was only when the source failed that he turned to other less reliable sources (such as Herodian and Maximus), as well as his own fertile imagination, and it was at this juncture that he composed the first five minor lives, through to the Life of Geta.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} that the Sixteenth Amendment was not ratified, and variations of this argument, have been officially identified as legally <b>frivolous</b> federal income tax return positions for purposes of the $5,000 <b>frivolous</b> tax return penalty imposed under Internal Revenue Code section 6702(a).|$|E
25|$|The penalty {{under section}} 6702 {{is a civil}} (non-criminal) penalty, and is $500 for {{positions}} taken on or before March 15, 2007. For positions taken after that date, the penalty amount has been increased to $5,000. The Internal Revenue Service has issued a list of positions considered to be legally <b>frivolous.</b> Shauna Henline, Senior Technical Coordinator of the <b>Frivolous</b> Return Program at the Internal Revenue Service, has testified that the IRS receives about 20,000 to 30,000 <b>frivolous</b> tax returns per year, and that approximately 100,000 related letters and other documents are received each year.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} that the United States does not include all or {{a part of the}} physical territory of the fifty states, and variations of this argument, have been officially identified as legally <b>frivolous</b> Federal tax return positions for purposes of the $5,000 <b>frivolous</b> tax return penalty imposed under Internal Revenue Code section 6702(a).|$|E
