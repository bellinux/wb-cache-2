25|$|Sernik - Sernik (cheesecake) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular desserts in Poland.

50|$|Some <b>fresh</b> <b>cheeses</b> are curdled only by acidity, {{but most}} cheeses also use rennet. Rennet sets the cheese into {{a strong and}} rubbery gel {{compared}} to the fragile curds produced by acidic coagulation alone. It also allows curdling at a lower acidity—important because flavor-making bacteria are inhibited in high-acidity environments. In general, softer, smaller, <b>fresher</b> <b>cheeses</b> are curdled with {{a greater proportion of}} acid to rennet than harder, larger, longer-aged varieties.|$|R

[...] As their work progressed Sinko would adjust the formulas of their cheese processing, the cultures, and the enzymes involved, and increased the average aging time for their Flagship brand to 18 months. However, they only publicly claim 12 months of aging. In their first year of operation, Beecher's had no aged product of their own to sell, instead building up an inventory of [...] of cheese.

2500|$|Another legend is {{that the}} birth of poutine took place in Princeville at the {{restaurant}} La Petite Vache, founded in 1966 by Henri Provencher. At that time, the Princesse cheese factory (now located in Plessisville) produced grain cheese but {{did not have a}} retail kiosk. La Petite Vache being located in a building adjacent to the cheese factory, they began selling <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese</b> at the restaurant's cash desk. An assiduous customer came to the restaurant and ordered french fries and bought a sack of cheese curds, then went to his table, opened the bag and mixed the cheese in with his fries. Max Sévigny, who owned the restaurant, confirmed in November 2010 that the original designation was 50-50 referring to a mixture of 50% fries and 50% cheese. The sauce was then included, and the name [...] "mixed" [...] was adopted. The 50-50 made its appearance {{in the first year of}} operation of La Petite Vache. For several years, in the cities of Plessisville, Princeville and Victoriaville, the poutine was known as a [...] "mixed". It was only when large chains began to sell this product that the name [...] "poutine" [...] appeared; probably in connection with other dishes also called poutines and made from potatoes. The name [...] "mixed" [...] continued to be used for several years in the above-named cities even after the word poutine was widely spread.|$|E
2500|$|During the 19th century, many Odia-speaking cooks were {{employed}} in Bengal, {{which led to the}} transfer of several food items between the two regions. Bengali cuisine is the only traditionally developed multi-course tradition from the Indian subcontinent that is analogous in structure to the modern service à la russe style of French cuisine, with food served course-wise rather than all at once. Bengali cuisine differs according to regional tastes, such as the emphasis on the use of chilli pepper in the Chittagong district of Bangladesh However, across all its varieties, there is predominant use of mustard oil along with large amounts of spices. The cuisine is known for subtle flavours with an emphasis on fish, meat, vegetables, lentils, and rice. Bread is not a common dish in Bengali cuisine, but a deep fried version called luchi is popular. Fresh sweetwater fish is one of its most distinctive features; Bengalis prepare fish in many ways, such as steaming, braising, or stewing in vegetables and sauces based on coconut milk or mustard. East Bengali food, which has a high presence in West Bengal and Bangladesh, is much spicier than the West Bengali cuisine, and tends to use high amounts of chilli, {{and is one of the}} spiciest cuisines in India and the World. Shondesh and Rasgulla are popular sweet dishes made of sweetened, finely ground <b>fresh</b> <b>cheese.</b> The rasgulla originated in Odisha and later became popular in erstwhile West Bengal.|$|E
