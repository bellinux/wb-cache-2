50|$|For most cardiac {{operations}} such as {{coronary artery}} bypass grafting, the cardiopulmonary bypass is performed using a heart-lung machine (or cardiopulmonary bypass machine). The heart-lung machine serves to replace {{the work of the}} heart during the open bypass surgery.

40|$|The Baer-Nunziato {{multiphase}} reactive {{theory for}} a granulated bed of energetic material is extended {{to allow for}} dynamic damage processes, that generate new surfaces as well as porosity. The Second Law of Thermodynamics is employed to constrain the constitutive forms of the mass, momentum, and energy <b>exchange</b> <b>functions</b> {{as well as those}} for the mechanical damage model ensuring that the models will be dissipative. The focus here is on the constitutive forms of the <b>exchange</b> <b>functions.</b> The mechanical constitutive modeling is discussed in a companion paper. The mechanical damage model provides dynamic surface area and porosity information needed by the <b>exchange</b> <b>functions</b> to compute combustion rates and interphase momentum and energy exchange rates.

50|$|Commercial {{activities}} in cultural sector presuppose clear ownership relations {{as well as}} the establishment of scarcity: both are due to legal and economic policy interventions. However, in contrast to common traditional cultural economics studies, Cultural Institutions Studies proceed from the assumption that the formation of non economic value is not just an accidental accompaniment of price formation. Monetary and non monetary value formation processes are mutually related to each other, often in a very tense relationship. Cultural goods with an <b>exchange</b> <b>function</b> must therefore be comprehensively analysed, taking into consideration all their multiple symbolic and economic, private and public, social and political functions.|$|E
50|$|Other {{functions}} rely not on {{recognition of}} some token or weight of metal in a marketplace, where time to detect any counterfeit is limited and benefits for successful passing-off are high, but on more stable long term social contracts: one cannot easily force a whole society {{to accept a}} different standard of deferred payment, require even small groups of people to uphold a floor price for a store of value, still less to re-price everything and rewrite all accounts to a unit of account (the most stable function). Thus {{it tends to be}} the medium of <b>exchange</b> <b>function</b> that constrains what {{can be used as a}} form of financial capital.|$|E
50|$|In {{the age of}} {{electronic}} money it was, and remains, common to use very long strings of difficult-to-reproduce numbers, generated by encryption methods, to authenticate transactions and commitments as having come from trusted parties. Thus the medium of <b>exchange</b> <b>function</b> has become wholly {{a part of the}} marketplace and its signals, and is utterly integrated with the unit of account function, so that, given the integrity of the public key system on which these are based, they become to that degree inseparable. This has clear advantages - counterfeiting is difficult or impossible unless the whole system is compromised, say by a new factoring algorithm. But at that point, the entire system is broken and the whole infrastructure is obsolete - new keys must be re-generated and the new system will also depend on some assumptions about difficulty of factoring.|$|E

Lung function became better {{in more than half}} (53. 5 %) of the patients and worse in one fourth (25. 6 %); a combination of positive and negative functional changes was detected in 14. 0 %.
