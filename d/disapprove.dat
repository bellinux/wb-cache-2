5|$|The Monk {{wrote of}} the event in the Histoire de Charles VI (History of Charles VI), {{covering}} about 25 years of the King's reign.

Mrs. Rusdio is Tini's friend from university. Aminah was one of Tini's competitors for Tono and enjoys interfering in the couple's lives.

50|$|Another {{possible}} type {{of parental}} meta-emotion is the <b>disapproving</b> philosophy. These parents reprimand {{their children for}} any type of emotional expression, even if the child's actions are appropriate. As a result, these children start to view their emotions as inappropriate and invalid, and {{have a difficult time}} with emotion regulation. For <b>disapproving</b> parents, negative emotions require a disciplinary response. Some <b>disapproving</b> parents may view their child's negative emotions as a means by which the child is attempting to manipulate or control the parent.|$|R
25|$|Judaism {{traditionally}} <b>disapproved</b> of cremation in {{the past}} (it was the traditional means of disposing the dead in the neighboring Bronze Age cultures). It has also <b>disapproved</b> of preservation of the dead by means of embalming and mummifying, a practice of the ancient Egyptians.|$|R
5|$|In 1972 Pontjo Nasution offered Chrisye the {{opportunity}} to play in New York. Although ecstatic, Chrisye was afraid of telling his father, who he thought would <b>disapprove</b> of the idea. He eventually fell ill for several months, during which time the rest of the band left for New York. After Chrisye discussed his fears with Joris and his mother, his father agreed that he could drop out of college to join Gipsy. After his health improved, in mid-1973, he left with Pontjo to meet Gipsy in New York. That same year he dropped out of Trisakti.|$|E

Karnan gets to know about his birth later. Kunti meets Karnan and gets two wishes from him, one that he will not attack any of her sons (the Pandavas) except Arjuna during the impending Kurukshetra War, and that he will attack Arjuna with the Nagastra weapon only once. Karnan refuses to join his brothers, the Pandavas and remains the friend of their enemy Duryodhana.|$|E
5|$|Krug {{began her}} library career in 1962 {{when she began}} working as a {{reference}} librarian at the John Crerar Library in Chicago. In 1963, she became a cataloguer for the Northwestern University Dental School. She became a research analyst for the American Library Association in 1965, and in 1967 she became director of its Office for Intellectual Freedom (OIF) upon its foundation. Krug described {{the role of the}} OIF as protection of the right of individuals in the U.S. to have comprehensive availability of information, regardless of those who <b>disapprove</b> of the material itself.|$|E
50|$|Hancock {{has said}} that he will act to defend the {{government}} of Azerbaijan in the British Parliament.

5000|$|Christie {{maintained}} positive {{approval ratings}} until early 2011. In a poll conducted by FDU PublicMind {{in the midst}} of more budget battles in May 2011, voters split evenly, with 44% approving and 44% <b>disapproving.</b> However, by September 2011, FDU's PublicMind showed that Christie’s approvals [...] "bounced back": 54% of New Jersey voters approved his job as governor while only 36% <b>disapproved.</b> A month later, the FDU PublicMind poll release of October 25, 2011, showed that Christie’s numbers remained strong, with 51% approving and 36% <b>disapproving.</b>|$|R
5|$|Not all Heathens {{practice}} seiðr; {{given its}} associations {{with both the}} ambiguity of sexuality and gender and the gods Odin and Loki in their unreliable trickster forms, many on the Heathen movement's right wing <b>disapprove</b> of it. Although there are heterosexual male practitioners, seiðr is largely associated with women and gay men. One member of the Troth, Edred Thorsson, developed forms of seiðr which involved sex magic utilizing sado-masochistic techniques, something which generated controversy in the community. Part of the discomfort that some Heathens feel toward seiðr surrounds {{the lack of any}} criteria by which the community can determine whether the seiðr-worker has genuinely received divine communication, and the fear that it will be used by some practitioners merely to bolster their own prestige.|$|E
5|$|Since Gemini {{was arrested}} at the college, Manisha discovers his {{identity}} and resents him. To regain her attention, Gemini reforms his ways. Though his gang initially <b>disapprove</b> of it, they relent. As Gemini and his gang regret their actions, Annamma reveals her true identity and forgives them. Singaperumal helps Gemini {{to get back into}} college and reunite with Manisha. Teja returns to his gang and continues his illegal activities. He pesters Gemini to help him in his business. Gemini informs Singaperumal of Teja's activities; Teja is caught smuggling narcotics, is prosecuted and serves a term in prison.|$|E
5|$|The victory {{strengthened}} Muhammad's {{position in}} Medina and dispelled earlier doubts among his followers. As a result, {{the opposition to}} him became less vocal. Pagans {{who had not yet}} converted were very bitter about the advance of Islam. Two pagans, Asma bint Marwan of the Aws Manat tribe and Abu 'Afak of the 'Amr b. 'Awf tribe, had composed verses taunting and insulting the Muslims. They were killed by people belonging to their own or related clans, and Muhammad did not <b>disapprove</b> of the killings. This report, however, is considered by some to be a fabrication. Most members of those tribes converted to Islam, and little pagan opposition remained.|$|E
5|$|The work, {{despite its}} attempt to depict Napoleon realistically, was criticised by several {{authorities}} {{for a variety of}} reasons.

5|$|Hancock {{emerged as}} a leading {{political}} figure in Boston just as tensions with Great Britain were increasing. In March 1765, he was elected as one of Boston's five selectmen, an office previously held by his uncle for many years. Soon after, Parliament passed the 1765 Stamp Act, a tax on legal documents, such as wills, that had been levied in Britain for many years but which was wildly unpopular in the colonies, producing riots and organized resistance. Hancock initially took a moderate position: as a loyal British subject, {{he thought that the}} colonists should submit to the act, even though he believed that Parliament was misguided. Within a few months, Hancock had changed his mind, although he continued to <b>disapprove</b> of violence and the intimidation of royal officials by mobs. Hancock joined the resistance to the Stamp Act by participating in a boycott of British goods, which made him popular in Boston. After Bostonians learned of the impending repeal of the Stamp Act, Hancock was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in May 1766.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) asks Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) to {{accompany}} him to the Six Sigmas Retreat in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, following his Bush administration and CEO debacles. There, Jack meets with the Six Sigmas, six men who each embody a core feature of Six Sigma: teamwork, insight, brutality, male enhancement, hand-shake-fulness and play-hard. They <b>disapprove</b> of Liz's antics during the team building exercises and demand that Jack distance himself from her {{if he wants to}} succeed, which he does. Before his dinner speech, Jack psyches himself up in the men's room, completely forgetting that he is wearing a microphone and that everyone can hear him. Liz quickly takes the stage to draw attention away from Jack's embarrassment and finally ends up ripping her blouse open and dancing in front of everyone. She succeeds, and is banned from the retreat forever.|$|E
5|$|Mace takes Lenny to her brother's {{house and}} watches Iris's disc. They {{discover}} that her death {{is tied to}} a cover-up {{of the murder of}} rapper Jeriko One by Steckler and Engleman, who <b>disapprove</b> of his politically-charged music. Lenny, Mace, and Max also learn that Tick has been rendered brain-dead from forcefully being exposed to highly amplified SQUID signals. Lenny concludes that the assault on Tick was committed by the same person who killed Iris and fears Faith will be next. Back at the nightclub, Lenny and Mace confront Faith, who tells them that Philo hired Iris to spy on Jeriko. As midnight approaches, Lenny and Mace sneak into a private party at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel that Philo is hosting for the city's wealthy elite. Lenny also gives Iris's disc to Mace so that she can deliver it to deputy police commissioner Palmer Strickland.|$|E

50|$|On May 10, 2005, Riley's {{approval}} ratings were 36% approving and 52% <b>disapproving</b> {{of his job}} as governor. By September 20, 2005, Riley’s {{approval ratings}} had increased substantially to 58 percent approving and 38% <b>disapproving.</b> Analysis of this increase {{seems to indicate that}} it may be attributed to the public’s perception of Riley’s response to Hurricane Katrina. By February 14, 2006, Riley's approval ratings had slightly decreased, with 52% approving and 43% <b>disapproving</b> of his job as governor. By August 2006, his approval rating was at 62% with a disapproval rating of 35%.|$|R
5|$|The Wars of the Roses were {{a series}} of {{conflicts}} between various English lords and nobles in support of two different royal families. In 1461 the conflict reached a milestone when the House of York supplanted its rival, the House of Lancaster, as the ruling royal house in England. Edward IV, leader of the Yorkists, seized the throne from the Lancastrian king, Henry VI, who was captured in 1465 and imprisoned in the Tower of London. The Lancastrian queen, Margaret of Anjou, and her son, Edward of Lancaster, fled to Scotland and organised resistance. Edward IV crushed the uprisings and pressured the Scottish government to force Margaret out; the House of Lancaster went into exile in France. As the Yorkists tightened their hold over England, Edward rewarded his supporters, including his chief adviser, Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, elevating them to higher titles and awarding them land confiscated from their defeated foes. The Earl grew to <b>disapprove</b> of the King's rule, however, and their relationship later became strained.|$|E
5|$|The {{partnership}} with Gilbert {{had been so}} profitable that Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer, eventually succeeding {{with the help of}} Tom Chappell, their music publisher. Their next opera, Utopia Limited (1893), ran for 245 performances, barely covering the expenses of the lavish production, although it was the longest run at the Savoy in the 1890s. Sullivan came to <b>disapprove</b> of the leading lady, Nancy McIntosh, and refused to write another piece featuring her, while Gilbert insisted that she must appear in his next opera. Instead, Sullivan teamed up again with his old partner, F. C. Burnand. The Chieftain (1894), a heavily revised version of their earlier two-act opera, The Contrabandista, flopped. Gilbert and Sullivan reunited one more time, after McIntosh announced her retirement from the stage, for The Grand Duke (1896). This also failed, and Sullivan never worked with Gilbert again, although their operas continued to be revived with success at the Savoy.|$|E
5|$|Voting {{was carried}} out between 23 and 28 May 1993 and FUNCINPEC secured 45.47% of all valid votes cast, which {{entitled}} them to take up 58 out of 120 seats in the constituent assembly FUNCINPEC obtained the most seats in Kampong Cham, Kandal and Phnom Penh. The CPP came in second place and secured 38.23% of valid votes, and were unhappy with {{the outcome of the}} elections. On 3 June 1993, CPP leaders Chea Sim and Hun Sen met with Sihanouk to propose that he should lead a new interim government, and also demanding power-sharing for the CPP with FUNCINPEC on a fifty-fifty basis. Sihanouk agreed to the CPP's proposal and announced the formation of an interim government that evening. Ranariddh and other FUNCINPEC leaders were not consulted over Sihanouk's proposal, and the announcement caught them by surprise. Ranariddh sent a fax to his father to <b>disapprove</b> of the CPP's proposal, and the United States expressed a similar stance. Sihanouk publicly rescinded his earlier announcement of the interim government's formation the following day.|$|E
