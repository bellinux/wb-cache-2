40|$|Introduction: The water {{footprint}} index {{as a complete}} indicator represents the actual used water in agriculture based on the climate condition, the amount of crop production, the people consumption pattern, the agriculture practices and water efficiency in any region. The {{water footprint}} in agricultural products is divided to three components, including green, blue and gray water footprint. Green water footprint is rainwater stored in soil profile and on vegetation. Blue water refers to water in rivers, lakes and aquifers which is used for irrigation purposes. Gray water footprint refers to define as the volume of contaminated water. The water footprint in arid and semiarid regions with high water requirement for plants and limited fresh water resources has considerable importance and {{key role in the}} planning and utilization of limited water resources in these regions. On the other hand, increasing the temperature and decreasing the rainfall due to climate change, are two agents which affect arid and semiarid regions.

Floor drains in processing environments harbor Listeria spp. due to continuous presence of humidity and organic substrates. The cleaning and washing activities undertaken may translocate the bacterial cells from the drain to the surrounding environment, thus contaminating food products being produced. This study validates the effectiveness of Johnson Diversey ‘Eliminex’ Foaming Drain Cleaner and Johnson Diversey ‘Final Step’ 512 sanitizer for inhibition of Listeria monocytogenes in drain surfaces and evaluates the potential for translocation of L. monocytogenes from drains to food contact surfaces in the surrounding environment using Listeria innocua as a surrogate. A 7 x 7 x 8 feet flexi glass chamber was built in which a 10 inch diameter drain mounted on an aluminum cabinet was placed. The drain was inoculated with the surrogate organism, L. innocua, at specific time intervals and then treated with the given chemicals. Sponge samples were taken and bacterial populations were recovered on Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA), Modified Oxford Medium (MOX) and Thin Agar Layer MOX (TALMOX). Stainless steel coupons (6. 4 x 1. 9 x 0. 1 cm) were hung at 3 different heights 1, 3 and 5 feet inside the chamber and cell translocation from the drain on to the stainless steel coupons was studied.

40|$|The rising of {{groundwater}} levels in {{urban and rural}} areas is a relevant topic of the Urban Hydrogeology because it affects different areas of the world requiring specific analyses and mitigation measures by the institutions involved in the protection and security of the territory. In the last century, in many developed countries processes of deindustrialization and urban transformation have caused the rising {{of groundwater}} levels and severe economic and social impacts. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse the rising of groundwater levels in a multi-layered pyroclastic-alluvial aquifer, located in the coastal plain eastward of Naples (southern Italy) and its interactions with buildings and agricultural lands. The research has been carried out by means of: i) analysis of stratigraphic settings by 86 boreholes and reconstruction of hydraulic conductivity logs; ii) reconstruction of a 2 D hydrostratigraphic model of the multi-layered pyroclastic-alluvial aquifer; iii) slug test and multitemporal hydrogeological monitoring of 83 wells, 9 piezometers and 12 river water levels; iv) analysis of daily rainfall time series; v) hydrogeological monitoring of impacted buildings and agricultural lands. For the monitored period (November 2013 -March 2015), the groundwater table showed a generalized rise, although with a spatial variability. The rise of groundwater levels ranged from a minimum of 0. 10 meters, in the central and eastern sector of the study area, to a maximum of 2. 05 meters, in the south-western sector, with an average growth rate of about 0. 16 m. The distribution of the impacted areas is not spatially homogeneous, and it was observed to vary over time. The hydrogeological interactions between groundwater and {{urban and rural areas}} are affected by: i) foundation types of buildings and the depth of the underground structures; ii) presence of shallow aquicludes (marshy clay-sands, clay-silts and peat levels) that determine local conditions of confinement for groundwater; iii) hydraulic efficiency and maintenance state of the dense network of drainage channels and micro-channels, which were historically built to <b>drain</b> <b>surface</b> water and groundwater in rural areas. The obtained results provide the basic data to set up a numerical groundwater flow model, which is an indispensable tool to simulate and predict the hydrogeological effects of possible safeguard actions on urban and agricultural areas...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presented}} {{the evolution of}} the contact resistance induced by the growth of the contact damage between the switch contact tip and the <b>drain</b> <b>surface</b> in the lifetime of an ohmic RF MEMS switch. Omron 2 SMES- 01 commercial switch was selected for the experiment. All switches were operated under the hot-switching condition with a steeply rising actuation voltage. The voltage across the switch (switching voltage) was maintained as 20 x of manufacturer’s specified value. Per million-cycle interval, the switching voltage, current, and contact resistance were recorded. The measurements showed three different situations of the contact resistance evolution: (i) the contact resistance monotonically decreases initially to a minimum and then monotonically increases; (ii) the resistance initially decreases to a local minimum, then increases to a local maximum, subsequently decreases to another local minimum, and finally increases; (iii) the resistance decreases initially and then increases until the switch fails in contact; the switch functions again after an intermitted response, and subsequently the resistance decreases again and then increases. A nonadhesive contact model is developed to explain these three situations. The modeling results show that the hot-switching condition changes properties of the contact materials, i. e., the elastic modulus and the yield strength, around the contact region and then causes some plastic deformation around the tip summit. The contact penetration and the contact area increase gradually due to the growth of the plastic deformation. Thus, the contact resistance which is reciprocally proportional to the contact area decreases in the initial stages of all cases. After unloading the tip per contact cycle, a residual depth is produced between the tip and the drain. The growth of the plastic deformation increases the residual depth. When the contact penetration reaches the value corresponding to the maximum contact area, the fixed electrostatic force cannot make the tip a deeper penetration due to a quite large residual depth. Consequently, the reduced contact penetration decreases the contact area. Therefore, the contact resistance dependent on the contact area rises gradually in the second stage as the first case. If the tip displacement caused by the electrostatic force is close to the tip–drain gap within a residual depth, a local minimum contact area will be produced to cause a local maximum contact resistance in the switch lifetime as the second case. A temporary failure in contact occurs when the tip displacement is smaller than the tip–drain gap within a residual depth. The slowing growth of the residual depth allows the tip–drain contact again as the third case...|$|E

40|$|A key {{tool for}} {{restoration}} {{and management of}} lowland wet grasslands is the control of ditch water levels. Past {{research has shown that}} ditch water level control alone may have limit effect on in-field water table levels in soils of low hydraulic conductivity that restrict lateral movement of water between the ditches to the intervening land units. The installation of grips or foot-drains (shallow channels that mimic natural surface topography) has been proposed and implemented as a means of linking ditch water levels and in-field wetness. This project set out to test the effectiveness of grips of different spacing on lowland grazing marshes underlain by mineral soils at three sites across southern England (Pawlett, Somerset; Otmoor, Oxfordshire; Berney, Norfolk), using water table levels and soil moisture measurements to index hydrological response and invertebrates as a measure of ecological response. The three sites had different soil properties (Otmoor heavy clays, Berney and Pawlett had well-structure soils). Volumetric soil moisture content showed a strong relationship with water-table depth in the well structured soils of Pawlett and Berney, but this was a weaker relationship at Otmoor with its low permeability soil. Overall, the results suggest that installation of grips can increase invertebrate numbers and biomass in wet grasslands on mineral soils, particularly where the soils are not well structured. Optimum grip spacing varies with soil type; in poorly structured soils (such as Otmoor) grips need to be closely spaced (5 m) to <b>drain</b> <b>surface</b> water, but will have little impact on the soil water table. In well-structure soils (such at Pawlett) grips can be about 20 m apart and still strongly influence the water table. Where soils have high permeability (such as Berney) grips or ditches can even be 60 - 70 m apart. An adequate source of water, infrastructure to maintain specific seasonal water levels and a means of evacuating excess water are essential requirements for a controlled water-regime. The case studies illustrated the need for a site-specific approach because the combination of these factors pertaining at any particular site will vary. The bird behaviour studies at Otmoor showed that pools of shallow water with slight slopes and a patchy vegetation structure provide valuable feeding habitats for both redshank and lapwing. The cross-sectional profile of the grips should therefore be shallow to maximise margins. This was support by the land managers at each site who indicated that shallow grips made it easier to use machinery on the site, such as mowers. By the end of the project, the grips at Otmoor were already showing infestation by emergent vegetation such as Typha latifolia that would reduce conveyance. Grips would need regular management to maintain their hydrological properties, such as clearance or possibly re-cutting every few year...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSome {{radionuclides}} {{are known}} to spontaneously emit alpha particles, which {{have been identified as}} a reliability issue in microelectronics. Despite their low stopping powers (< 1. 45 MeV / (mg/cm 2) in silicon), these alpha particles are able to trigger Single Event Transient (SET) and Single Event Upset (SEU) in modern technologies and it is useful to evaluate the effect of alpha emitters on the Soft Error Rate (SER). The radionuclides that are likely to be introduced during semiconductor processing have been previously identified. Here, we focus on the decay chain of Uranium 238 which is very abundant in nature and thus in the raw materials {{that can be used for}} microelectronics processing. Uranium 238 chain contains 8 radiaoactive nuclei which produce alpha particles. Along their paths the alpha particles are able to generate electron-hole pairs, which diffuse and may lead to transient currents that affect directly the device reliability. In order to accurately evaluate the reliability of a given device, it is mandatory to understand in detail the main properties of the transient currents (e. g. the shape) that are generated during particle emission. It has already been asserted that a double exponential law can model the shape of the transient current, but it is a priori difficult to determine the values of the parameters of this law. Moreover, these parameters strongly depend on the technology as well as the nature and energy of the ionizing particle. Focusing on the Uranium decay chain we investigated the pollution of the bulk and the properties of the transient currents which are generated at an electrode of a 65 nm and a 40 nm technologies. To do so, we used a Monte Carlo approach. The simulated structure is a silicon layer with a surface of 30 µm x 30 µm and a thickness of 20 µm. Above this bulk, we added a layer of 10 µm of silicon dioxide to account for the Back End Of Line (BEOL). At the Si/SiO 2 interface, we simulate 12 x 12 drain electrodes whose characteristic dimensions are extrapolated from actual sequential logic circuits implemented with 65 nm and 40 nm technologies. Then we trigger alpha emission at random in the structure assuming that the contamination is uniform. We assume the secular equilibrium for the decay chain which means that even if the concentrations of the emitters are different, their activities are equal. The concentration of the Uranium 238 nucleus is typically around 100 ppt after recent works. Then its activity is easily obtained. Following the alpha particle along its path, we use the diffusion law model to determine how the carrier concentrations vary in space and time. We then numerically divide the ion track into small fragments that spherically diffuse their charges which are calculated using SRIM results. A portion of these electrical charges is collected by the drain electrode that is itself divided into elemental sections. The integration of the collected charge along the whole track and over the whole <b>drain</b> <b>surface</b> gives the final current pulse. A high number of disintegrations is chosen to have a good enough statistic. Yet, because the critical charge is typically above 0. 5 - 1 fC for the investigated technologies, we trigger enough disintegration to have hundreds of transient pulses for which the total collected charge is higher than 0. 5 fC. Finally, we present the characteristics of these pulses such as their amplitude and full width at medium height. It allows having guidelines on the kind of transient pulses that can be produced by alpha particles...|$|E
