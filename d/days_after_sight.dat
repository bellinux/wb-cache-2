6000|$|... [48] [In {{consequence}} of the great extension of commerce {{since the time of}} Defoe, a short explanation of the principle and practice of drawing foreign bills of exchange now seems necessary. Foreign bills of exchange are used, {{in order to avoid the}} necessity of transmitting actual money from one country to another. A merchant, for instance, in Nova Scotia, is owing £100 to a manufacturer in Glasgow: he seeks out some one who is a creditor to that amount to some person in Britain; we shall say he finds a captain in the army who wishes to draw £100 from his agent in London. To this captain the Nova Scotia merchant pays £100, and gets his order or bill on the London agent, which bill he sends to the manufacturer in Glasgow, and the manufacturer transmits the bill to London for payment; any banker, indeed, will give him the money for it, deducting a small commission. Thus two debts are liquidated, without the transmission of a farthing in money. The demand for bills in foreign countries to send to Great Britain, has the effect of raising them to a premium, which is called the rate of exchange, and is a burden which falls on the purchaser of the bill. Foreign bills of exchange drawn on parties in Great Britain, have expressed upon them the number of <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>sight</b> at which they are to be payable. Thus, a merchant on receiving a foreign bill drawn at 'thirty days after sight,' hastens to get it 'sighted,' or shown to the party on whom it is drawn, and that party accepts it, at the same time marking the date of doing so. The bill is then complete and negociable, and is presented for payment to the acceptor at the end of the time specified, allowing the usual three days of grace. Should the bill not be accepted on being 'sighted,' it is a dishonoured bill, and is returned with a legal protest to the foreign correspondent. To avert, as far as possible, the loss of foreign bills by shipwreck, a set of three bills is drawn for each transaction, called first, second, and third, of the same tenor. For example: 'Thirty <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>sight</b> pay this my first bill of exchange, for the sum of £100 sterling; second and third of the same tenor being unpaid.' This first bill is first sent, and by next conveyance the second is sent. Should the first arrive safely, the second, on making its appearance, is destroyed. The third is retained by the foreign correspondent till he hear whether the former two have arrived at their destination, and is sent only if they have been lost. On receiving whichever comes first, it is the duty of the receiver to communicate intelligence of the fact to the sender.] ...|$|E
6000|$|After your Committee {{had made}} the {{foregoing}} observations upon the plan of Mr. Hastings and his colleagues, transmitted to the Court of Directors, an extract of the Madras Consultations was {{a few days ago}} laid before us. This extract contains a letter from the Governor-General and Council of Bengal to the Presidency of Fort St. George, which affords a very striking, though to your Committee by no means an unexpected, picture of the instability of their opinions and conduct. On the 8th of April the servants had regularly formed and digested the above-mentioned plan, which was to form the basis for the investment of their own fortunes, and to furnish the sole means of the commercial existence of their masters. Before the 10th of the following May, which is the date of their letter to Madras, they inform Lord Macartney that they had fundamentally altered the whole scheme. [...] "Instead," [...] say they, [...] "of allowing the subscribers to retain an interest in the goods, they are to be provided entirely on account of the Company, and transported at their risk; and the subscribers, instead of receiving certificates payable out of the produce of the sales in Europe, are to be granted receipts, on the payment of their advances, bearing an interest of eight per cent per annum, until exchanged for drafts on the Court of Directors, payable 365 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>sight,</b> at the rate of two shillings per current rupee,--which drafts shall be granted in the proper time, of three eighths of the amount subscribed, on the 31st of December next, and the remaining five eighths on the 31st of December, 1783." ...|$|E

50|$|At 11:25 am on August 15, 1950, Nick Mariana, {{the general}} manager of the Great Falls Electrics minor-league {{baseball}} team, and his nineteen-year-old secretary, Virginia Raunig, were inspecting the empty Legion Stadium baseball field before a game. The Electrics were a farm club of the Brooklyn Dodgers. A bright flash caught Mariana's eye and, according to his reports, he saw two bright silvery objects, rotating while flying over Great Falls at a speed he estimated to be two hundred to four hundred miles per hour. He believed that they were roughly fifty feet wide and one hundred and fifty feet apart. Mariana ran to his car to retrieve his 16 mm movie camera and filmed the UFOs for sixteen seconds. The camera could film the objects in color, but could not record sound. Raunig also witnessed the objects. The <b>day</b> <b>after</b> Mariana's <b>sighting,</b> the Great Falls Tribune, the city's daily newspaper, described his sighting and the film in an article, which was picked up by other media outlets around the nation. For several weeks <b>after</b> the <b>sighting,</b> Mariana showed his film to local community groups, including the Central Roundtable Athletic Club.|$|R
60|$|The long calms {{and light}} head-winds had {{prevented}} the vessels from making much progress {{for the few}} last days; and, by estimating the distance that was subsequently run in a course but a little south of west, it appears, notwithstanding all the encouraging signs of birds, fishes, calms, and smooth water, that {{on the morning of}} Monday, September 24th, or that of the fifteenth <b>day</b> <b>after</b> losing <b>sight</b> of Ferro, the expedition was about half-way across the Atlantic, counting from continent to continent, on the parallel of about 31 or 32 degrees of north latitude. The circumstance of the vessels being so far north of the Canaries, when it is known that they had been running most of the time west, a little southerly, must be imputed to the course steered in the scant winds, and perhaps to the general set of the currents. With this brief explanation, we return to the daily progress of the ships.|$|R
2500|$|In 1998, {{the light}} from a {{supernova}} in NGC 3982 (later called SN 1998aq) reached earth and was discovered by British amateur astronomer Mark Armstrong. It was discovered when it had an apparent magnitude of 14.9 and it had grown considerably brighter by two <b>days</b> <b>after</b> its initial <b>sighting</b> (it reached a maximum magnitude of 14.0). The explosion resulted from a binary system where a white dwarf star was capturing mass from its companion star. When the white dwarf had gathered enough mass and was {{no longer able to}} support itself, the star detonated in a violent and extremely bright explosion. [...] Since a supernova explosion roughly occurs in a typical spiral galaxy every 100 years, astronomers use high-resolution images of NGC 3982 and other galaxies to detect stars which are nearing a similar explosive descent into supernovae.|$|R
25|$|On 16 January 1944, U-66 left Lorient {{for what}} would be her last patrol and the last command of Oberleutnant zur See Gerhard Seehausen (posthumously {{promoted}} to Kapitänleutnant). A month and ten <b>days</b> <b>after</b> departure, U-66 <b>sighted</b> Silvermaple, a 5,313-ton British motor merchant in the convoy ST-12. She was sunk after one torpedo hit. Four days later, the boat came upon the French 5,202-ton St. Louis, which she sank with two torpedoes off Accra, Ghana. The ship broke into three parts, which sank in less than 50 seconds. Four <b>days</b> <b>after</b> the sinking of St. Louis, 'U-66 sank the 4,964-ton British John Holt with two torpedoes, and took the captain, Master Cecil Gordon Hime, and a passenger, Mr Elliott - {{an agent of the}} Holt Shipping Company, prisoner.

U-66 was supposed to be resupplied by , but this boat, a Milchkuh supply submarine, was sunk on 26 April.|$|R
2500|$|Abel Tasman led {{the first}} known European {{expedition}} to reach Tasmania. His journal records that he first sighted Tasmania on 24 November 1642. [...] The translation of the journal entry for 1 December 1642, seven days later, refers to Wit's islands, Sueers islands, Maetsuickers islands (Maatsuyker Islands) and Boereels islands. The names {{of all of these}} islands and Tasmania itself under its then name of Van Diemens Land were all names of then members of the Council of India of Tasman's employer, the Dutch East India Company (see Tasman's 1642 orders in Appendix D of the journal). [...] Antonio Van Diemen was the Governor-General and so got the name of the largest island. [...] This journal entry for 1 December came only 7 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> the first <b>sighting</b> of Tasmania, so it is evident that the Maatsuyker Islands Group was named in honour of Joan Maetsuycker (today's spelling would be Johan), who was also a councillor.|$|R
60|$|No {{land was}} seen. The vessels {{continued}} their progress {{at a rate}} but little varying from five miles the hour, shoving aside the weeds, which at times accumulated in masses, under their bows, but which could offer no serious obstacle to their progress. As for the admiral, so lofty were his views, so steady his opinions concerning the great geographical problem {{he was about to}} solve, and so determined his resolution to persevere to the end, that he rather hoped to miss than to fall in with the islands, that he fancied could be at no great distance. The day and night carried the vessels rather more than one hundred miles to the westward, placing the fleet not far from midway between the meridians that bounded the extreme western and eastern margins of the two continents, though still much nearer to Africa than to America, following the parallel of latitude on which it was sailing. As the wind continued steady, and the sea was as smooth as a river, the three vessels kept close together, the Pinta, the swiftest craft, reducing her canvas for that purpose. During the afternoon's watch of the day that succeeded that of the meeting with the weeds, which was Monday, the 17th September, or the eighth <b>day</b> <b>after</b> losing <b>sight</b> of Ferro, Martin Alonzo Pinzon hailed the Santa Maria, and acquainted the pilot on deck of his intention to get the amplitude of the sun, as soon as the luminary should be low enough, with a view to ascertain how far his needles retained their virtue.

40|$|The {{population}} of Sanderlings Calidris alba along the East Atlantic flyway has grown considerably {{during the last}} decades. Perhaps reflecting this augmented population size, increasing numbers of Sanderling {{have been reported to}} stage in the Wadden Sea during spring and autumn migration. Estimates of the numbers of Sanderlings in the Wadden Sea have previously been based on a limited number of counts that were not corrected for the turnover of individuals. In this study, we accounted for turnover using estimates of the probability that individually colour-ringed Sanderlings are still present two <b>days</b> <b>after</b> a <b>sighting.</b> In combination with daily counts during high tide, we estimated the total number of Sanderlings that used the island Griend and surrounding mudflats, in the western Dutch Wadden Sea, during southward passage in 2013 and 2014. We also estimated minimal staging durations of Sanderlings at Griend. Non-moulting birds were significantly heavier upon capture, which suggests that they were refuelling for long non-stop migratory flights. Winter sightings confirmed that the non-moulting Sanderlings winter in sub-Saharan Africa and that the moulting Sanderlings spent the winter in Europe or northern Africa. With an average minimal stay in the western Dutch Wadden Sea of 9 days in 2013 and 12 in 2014, non-moulting Sanderlings stayed for a much shorter time than moulting Sanderlings, which stayed for 32 days in 2013 and 36 days in 2014. Non-moulting individuals {{were less likely to be}} resighted between years. Estimates of minimal staging duration are likely underestimates of the true staging duration, and we propose that moulting Sanderlings probably complete their wing moult in the Wadden Sea. We estimated that the total number of Sanderlings using the western Dutch Wadden Sea before migration to European or African wintering areas were 27, 546 (95 % Cl 22, 739 – 41, 449) in 2013 and 22, 574 (95 % Cl 16, 436 – 46, 114) in 2014.
