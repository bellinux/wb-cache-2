40|$|Foetal MRI {{represents}} a non-invasive imaging technique that allows detailed visualisation of foetus in utero and the maternal structure. This thesis outlines the quantitative imaging techniques used {{to investigate the}} effect of maternal diabetes and maternal smoking on foetal development at 1. 5 Tesla. The effect of maternal diabetes on placental blood flow and foetal growth was studied. The placental images were acquired using Echo Planar Imaging and blood flow was measured using Intra Voxel Incoherent Motion. The results indicate that peak blood flow in the basal plate and chorionic plate increases across gestation in both normal and diabetic pregnancies. Conversely, diffusion in the whole placenta decreases across gestation, with a more pronounced decrease in diabetic placentae. Following this, a method was developed to use a TJ weighted fat suppressed MRI scan to quantify foetal fat images in-utero. In addition, HAlf Fourier Single-shot Turbo spin Echo (HASTE) and balanced Fast Field Echo (bFFE) were used to acquire images encompassing the whole foetus in three orthogonal planes. These scans were used to measure foetal volume, foetal length and shoulder width. The data shows that foetal fat volume and intra-abdominal fat were increased in foetuses of diabetic mothers at third trimester. The HASTE and bFFE sequences were also used to study the effect of maternal smoking on foetal development. Here, <b>foetal</b> <b>organ</b> volumes, foetal and placental volume, shoulder width and foetal length were measured using a semi automatic approach based {{on the concept of}} edge detection and a stereological method, the Cavalieri technique. The data shows that maternal smoking has significant negative effect on <b>foetal</b> <b>organ</b> growth and foetal growth, predominantly foetal kidney and foetal volume. The work described here certainly has a great potential in non-invasive assessment of abnormal placental function and can be used to study foetal development.

40|$|Background Perfluoroalkyl {{substances}} (PFASs) are bio-accumulative pollutants, and prenatal {{exposure to}} PFASs {{is believed to}} impact human foetal development and may have long-term adverse health effects later in life. Additionally, maternal cigarette smoking {{may be associated with}} PFAS levels. Foetal exposure has previously been estimated from umbilical cord plasma, but the actual concentration in <b>foetal</b> <b>organs</b> has never been measured. Objectives The concentrations of 5 PFASs and cotinine – the primary metabolite of nicotine – were measured in human foetuses, placentas, and maternal plasma to evaluate to what extent these compounds were transferred from mother to foetus and to determine if the PFAS concentrations were associated with maternal cigarette smoking. Methods Thirty-nine Danish women who underwent legal termination of pregnancy before gestational week 12 were included; 24 maternal blood samples were obtained together with 34 placental samples and 108 <b>foetal</b> <b>organs.</b> PFASs and cotinine were assayed by liquid chromatography/triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Results In <b>foetal</b> <b>organs,</b> the average concentrations of perfluorooctanesulphonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDa), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) were 0. 6 ng/g, 0. 2 ng/g, 0. 1 ng/g, 0. 1 ng/g, and 0. 1 ng/g, respectively. A significant positive correlation was found between the exposure duration, defined as foetal age, and foetal to maternal ratio for all five PFASs and cotinine. Smokers presented 99 ng/g cotinine in plasma, 108 ng/g in placenta, and 61 ng/g in <b>foetal</b> <b>organs.</b> No correlation between the maternal cotinine concentrations and PFAS concentrations was found. Conclusions PFASs were transferred from mother to foetus, however, with different efficiencies. The concentrations of PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFUnDA, and PFDA in <b>foetal</b> <b>organs</b> were much lower than the maternal concentrations. Furthermore, a significant correlation between the exposure duration and all of the evaluated PFASs was found.

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} {{guidelines}} for managing radiation exposure incidents involving patients in diagnostic and interventional radiology. The work {{is based on}} collation of experiences from representatives of international and national organizations for radiologists, medical physicists, radiographers, regulators, and equipment manufacturers, derived from an International Atomic Energy Agency Technical Meeting. More serious overexposures can result in skin doses high enough to produce tissue reactions, in interventional procedures and computed tomography, most notably from perfusion studies. A major factor involved has been deficiencies in training of staff in operation of equipment and optimization techniques. The use of checklists and time outs before procedures commence, and dose alerts when critical levels are reached during procedures can provide safeguards to reduce risks of these effects occurring. However, unintended and accidental overexposures resulting in relatively small additional doses can take place in any diagnostic or interventional X-ray procedure {{and it is important}} to learn from errors that occur, as these may lead to increased risks of stochastic effects. Such events may involve the wrong examinations, procedural errors, or equipment faults. Guidance is given on prevention, investigation and dose calculation for radiology exposure incidents within healthcare facilities. Responsibilities should be clearly set out in formal policies, and procedures should be in place to ensure that root causes are identified and deficiencies addressed. When an overexposure of a patient or an unintended exposure of a foetus occurs, the <b>foetal,</b> <b>organ,</b> skin and/or effective dose may be estimated from exposure data. When doses are very low, generic values for the examination may be sufficient, but a full assessment of doses to all exposed organs and tissues may sometimes be required. The use of general terminology to describe risks from stochastic effects is recommended rather than calculation of numerical values, as these are misleading when applied to individuals...|$|E
40|$|Parasite {{loads of}} {{different}} tissues were assessed in guinea pig foetus after maternal infection. Twelve female guinea pigs were infected with 100 cysts of the 76 K strain of Toxoplasma gondii by the oral route. Inoculation was performed 20 ± 5 days (G 20) or 40 ± 5 days (G 40) after {{the beginning of}} gestation. Gestational age was determined by progesterone assay. Maternal and <b>foetal</b> <b>organ</b> samples were taken 60 days after the beginning of gestation. Parasite loads (from placenta, amniotic fluid (AF), cord blood (CB), foetal brain, liver, lung and spleen) were assessed by a real-time PCR quantification using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) hybridization probes on the Light Cycler®. Congenital transmission was proven {{by the presence of}} parasites in blood or tissue samples of the foetus in 84. 6 % (11 / 13) and 100 % (16 / 16) of cases after inoculation on G 20 and G 40, respectively. The quantitative analysis of our results after inoculation at G 20 and G 40 has allowed us to determinate the positive parasitic loads {{as a function of the}} origin of the sample and the period of inoculation. The parasite loads expressed as log (parasite/g) were low in AF and CB samples: 1. 49 ± 0. 50 and 1. 05 ± 0. 10 at G 20 and 1. 21 ± 0. 36 and 1. 20 ± 0. 42 at G 40 respectively.

Echocardiography shows impaired heart function in both SMGRKO and GR(-/-) mice at embryonic day (E) 17. 5, associated with generalized oedema. Cardiac ultrastructure is markedly disrupted in both SMGRKO and GR(-/-) mice at E 17. 5, with short, disorganized myofibrils and cardiomyocytes that fail to align in the compact myocardium. Failure to induce critical genes involved in contractile function, calcium handling and energy metabolism underpins this common phenotype. However, although hearts of GR(-/-) mice are smaller, with 22 % reduced ventricular volume at E 17. 5, SMGRKO hearts are normally sized. Moreover, while levels of mRNA encoding atrial natriuretic peptide are reduced in E 17. 5 GR(-/-) hearts, they are normal in foetal SMGRKO hearts.

To elucidate the developmental basis for the observed distribution, we investigated the isoenzymic transitions of phosphofructokinase in human foetuses (12 - 40 weeks' gestation) by using high-resolution chromatography and monoclonal antibodies. We studied skeletal muscle, heart, liver and brain because these organs show very different glycolytic fluxes and isoenzymic patterns in adult individuals.

The objective {{of the present study}} was to determine the ability of this isolate to induce foetal death in a pregnant bovine model. For this purpose, 13 naïve pregnant heifers were divided into three groups and were experimentally challenged with either 107 tachyzoites of Nc- 1 (group 1, n =  5), Nc-Spain 1 H (group 2, n =  5) isolates or phosphate-buffered saline (group 3, n =  3) intravenously at 70 days of gestation. After inoculation, pregnancy was monitored and dams were sacrificed when foetal death was detected. The remaining animals were slaughtered at 45 days post-infection. Maternal and foetal samples were collected for examination by histology and parasite DNA detection. Parasitaemia, specific anti-N. caninum IgG and interferon γ responses were also studied. At 3 - 4 weeks after infection, foetal death was detected in 3 out of 5 Nc- 1 -infected dams. However, no evidence of foetal death was observed in either Nc-Spain 1 H-infected or control groups during the period studied.

It was in these animals that N. caninum DNA was more frequently detected. Parasitaemia was observed in all Nc- 1 -infected dams and in only 3 out of 5 Nc-Spain 1 H-infected animals. The magnitude of the immune response was significantly higher in the Nc- 1 -inoculated group than in the group inoculated with the Nc-Spain 1 H isolate. These data reveal the reduced virulence of the Nc-Spain 1 H isolate in cattle...|$|R
40|$|Mouse bone marrow-derived {{adherent}} cell populations promoted {{proliferation of}} haemopoietic cells in vitro in a liquid culture system {{for at least}} 4 weeks. Adherent cell layers derived from other haemopoietic <b>organs</b> (<b>foetal</b> liver, adult spleen) and fibroblasts from embryonic tissues did not maintain haemopoietic cells in this system. Medium, conditioned by adherent cells derived from foetal liver, spleen and embryonic tissues, displayed a considerable colony stimulating activity (CSA). Marrow-derived adherent cells produced no detectable CSA. A possible relationship between the in vitro expression of a growth-promoting activity of an adherent cell population on haemopoietic cells, and its endogenous CSA production, is discussed.

40|$|Abstract Background Eph kinases are {{the largest}} family of cell surface {{receptor}} tyrosine kinases. The ligands of Ephs, ephrins (EFNs), are also cell surface molecules. Ephs interact with EFNs transmitting signals in both directions, i. e., from Ephs to EFNs and from EFNs to Ephs. EFNB 1 {{is known to be}} able to co-stimulate T cells in vitro and to modulate thymocyte development in a model of <b>foetal</b> thymus <b>organ</b> culture. To further understand the role of EFNB 1 in T cell immunity, we generated T-cell-specific EFNB 1 gene knockout mice to assess T cell development and function in these mice. Results The mice were of normal size and cellularity in the thymus and spleen and had normal T cell subpopulations in these organs. The bone marrow progenitors from KO mice and WT control mice repopulated host spleen T cell pool to similar extents. The activation and proliferation of KO T cells was comparable to that of control mice. Naïve KO CD 4 cells showed an ability to differentiate into Th 1, Th 2, Th 17 and Treg cells similar to control CD 4 cells. Conclusions Our results suggest that the function of EFNB 1 in the T cell compartment could be compensated by other members of the EFN family, and that such redundancy safeguards the pivotal roles of EFNB 1 in T cell development and function. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{to be described}} were undertaken {{as part of a}} programme of research in relation to rheumatoid arthritis, supported by the Nuffield Foundation. Modern work on the pathogenesis of this disease suggests that immunologic reactions, and in particular autoallergy, may be concerned in its causation. As a first stage in our investigations, it was decided to study the direct action of antibodies on bone and cartilage by exposing <b>foetal</b> bones in <b>organ</b> culture to antiserum. The influence of hydrocortisone on the changes produced in the explants by serum and antiserum was also studied, since previous work has shown that this hormone inhibits the breakdown of cells and intercellular material in culture (l- 3) and cortisone is well known to give a temporary remission of symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis. Material and Methods Explants. [...] The explants were obtained from foetal mice near term, the following bones being removed from each foetus: scapulae, humeri, radii, ulnae, femora, and tibiae; in Experimen...|$|R
40|$|Apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf- 1) is a {{component}} of the apoptosome which is required for the activation of procaspase- 9. As Apaf- 1 knockout (KO) (Apaf- 1 (-/-)) mice die before birth, the role of Apaf- 1 during thymic selection was investigated using 5 day <b>foetal</b> thymic <b>organ</b> culture (FTOC) of thymi obtained at gestational day 15. There was a lower ratio of CD 4 single-positive (SP) to CD 8 SP cells and decreased apoptosis of CD 4 (+) CD 8 (+) (DP) thymocytes from Apaf- 1 (-/-) mice compared with wild-type. To determine if these defects resulted in increased production of neglected thymocytes, the Apaf- 1 (-/-) mice were crossed with the T-cell receptor (TCR) - alpha-chain KO mice. There was no difference in thymocyte development in the thymi of TCR-alpha (-/-) Apaf- 1 (-/-) and TCR-alpha (-/-) Apaf- 1 (+/+) mice 5 days after FTOC. To determine if Apaf- 1 is involved in apoptosis during death by negative or positive selection, FTOC of the thymus of Apaf- 1 D- -/-(b) /HY TCR-alphabeta transgenic (Tg) mice was carried out. There was decreased apoptosis of the HY clonal-specific M 33 (+) thymocytes and an increased percentage of the autoreactive CD 8 (+) M 33 (+) thymocytes in male, but not female Apaf- 1 (-/-) D-b/HY TCR Tg mice. Our data suggest that Apaf- 1 is not involved in positive selection or death by neglect, but may have a partial role in negative selection during early thymic T-cell development...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSonic Hedgehog (Shh) is {{expressed}} in the thymus, where it regulates T cell development. Here we investigated the influence of Shh on thymic epithelial cell (TEC) development. Components of the Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway were expressed by TEC, and use of a Gli Binding Site-green fluorescence protein (GFP) transgenic reporter mouse demonstrated active Hh-dependent transcription in TEC in the foetal and adult thymus. Analysis of Shh-deficient <b>foetal</b> thymus <b>organ</b> cultures (FTOC) showed that Shh is required for normal TEC differentiation. Shh-deficient foetal thymus contained fewer TEC than wild type (WT), the proportion of medullary TEC was reduced relative to cortical TEC, and cell surface expression of MHC Class II molecules was increased on both cortical and medullary TEC populations. In contrast, the Gli 3 -deficient thymus, which shows increased Hh-dependent transcription in thymic stroma, had increased numbers of TEC, but decreased cell surface expression of MHC Class II molecules on both cortical and medullary TEC. Neutralisation of endogenous Hh proteins in WT FTOC led {{to a reduction in}} TEC numbers, and in the proportion of mature Aire-expressing medullary TEC, but an increase in cell surface expression of MHC Class II molecules on medullary TEC. Likewise, conditional deletion of Shh from TEC in the adult thymus resulted in alterations in TEC differentiation and consequent changes in T cell development. TEC numbers, and the proportion of mature Aire-expressing medullary TEC were reduced, and cell surface expression of MHC Class II molecules on medullary TEC was increased. Differentiation of mature CD 4 and CD 8 single positive thymocytes was increased, demonstrating the regulatory role of Shh production by TEC on T cell development. Treatment of human thymus explants with recombinant Shh or neutralising anti-Shh antibody indicated that the Hedgehog pathway is also involved in regulation of differentiation from DP to mature SP T cells in the human thymus...|$|R
