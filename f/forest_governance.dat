25|$|Although a {{majority}} of forests continue to be owned formally by government, the effectiveness of <b>forest</b> <b>governance</b> is increasingly independent of formal ownership. Since neo-liberal ideology in the 1980s and the emanation of the climate change challenges, evidence {{that the state is}} failing to effectively manage environmental resources has emerged. Under neo-liberal regimes in the developing countries, {{the role of the state}} has diminished and the market forces have increasingly taken over the dominant socio-economic role.|$|E

The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has estimated that a total of approximately US$547.2 million (1 billion Brazilian reais) per year would be required from international sources to compensate the forest developers and establish a highly organized framework to fully implement <b>forest</b> <b>governance</b> and monitoring, and the foundation of new protected forest areas in the Amazon for future sustainability.|$|E

30|$|Studies on {{views and}} attitudes of local people towards {{community}} versus state <b>forests</b> <b>governance</b> and management are lacking in Ethiopia (Tesfaye 2011; Tesfaye et al. 2012). This study was the first attempt that examined the views {{and attitudes of}} local people towards community versus state <b>forests</b> <b>governance,</b> conservation, and management interventions, identifying sources of conflicts and proposing solutions in future management and policy decisions in Tehulederi District. This is because views and attitudes are understood to be important antecedents of people’s behaviour in relation to forest conservation and management (Jotte 1997; Oskamp 1977; Kelboro and Stellmacher 2015). Several studies also considered views and attitudes of local people as a major topic, mostly, in relation to forest conservation and management (e.g. Agarwal 2001; Mehta and Heinen 2001; Kideghesho et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2009; Tesfaye 2011; Tadesse and Tafere 2017; Tadesse and Teketay 2017).|$|R
30|$|Key {{informants}} (i.e. {{persons who}} are supposed to be knowledgeable of their locality and have good knowledge (Kelboro and Stellmacher 2015) about community and state <b>forests</b> <b>governance)</b> were selected in consultation with development agents and kebele administrators. The key informants were mainly elderly men and women, religious leaders, and opinion makers in the community. The interviews were also conducted with development agents, kebele administrators, and experts working at Tehulederi District Office of Agriculture. A total of 25 individuals were interviewed through this method.|$|R
2500|$|Broadly speaking, {{the goal}} of forest {{conservation}} has historically not been met when, in contrast with land use changes; driven by demand for food, fuel and profit. It is necessary to recognize and advocate for better <b>forest</b> <b>governance</b> more strongly {{given the importance of}} forest in meeting basic human needs in the future and maintaining ecosystem and biodiversity as well as addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation goal. Such advocacy must be coupled with financial incentives for government of developing countries and greater governance role for local government, civil society, private sector and NGOs on behalf of the [...] "communities".|$|E
5000|$|Community-based forest {{management}} (CBFM) constitutes “a powerful paradigm that evolved {{out of the}} failure of state <b>forest</b> <b>governance</b> to ensure the sustainability of forest resources and the equitable distribution of access to and benefits from them”. [...] In 1995, the Philippine government adopted CBFM as a national scheme to promote sustainable <b>forest</b> <b>governance,</b> in recognition of the negative impacts occurring as a result of widespread forest loss across the country. The scheme stresses the importance of involving communities in sustaining the forest through projects such as timber harvesting, agro-forestry and livestock raising. CBFM therefore advocates an increasingly ‘bottom up’ - as opposed to the historically ‘top down’ and centralised - approach to sustainable <b>forest</b> <b>governance</b> involving a variety of stakeholders. By 2005, 5503 projects had been established across the country. For this reason the Philippines has been considered a pioneer within Asia for the successful implementation of CBFM as a nationwide tool of <b>forest</b> <b>governance.</b>|$|E

30|$|At present, {{community}} forestry {{has been}} seen {{in a number of}} catchments/woodlots in Tehulederi District, South Wollo, Ethiopia. However, no quantitative and qualitative studies were so far conducted to justify how community forest management serves as an alternative to state forest so as to enhance the condition of the forest resources. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the views and attitudes of local people towards community versus state <b>forests</b> <b>governance.</b> Accordingly, the following three questions were addressed in the present study: (1) Has the implementation of community forest management been a failure or a success so far? (2) If so, where has it been achieved? (3) If not, why not? One of the assumptions for this study was that the conventional approach (i.e. when forests are managed and governed by the state) to forest conservation is not effective because the forests are subjected to illegal access and/or unregulated utilization. In contrast, the community forestry approach alleviates the existing excessive pressure on forests by regulated access as the local communities become caretakers of the community forests. The objectives of the study were to (1) examine the views and attitudes of local people towards community versus state <b>forests</b> <b>governance</b> and (2) evaluate the management practices implemented in the community versus state forestry and their implications on the forest status and the livelihood of local people.|$|R
30|$|Views {{and attitudes}} are {{positive}} or negative responses of people towards a certain event (e.g. community versus state <b>forests</b> <b>governance)</b> (Jotte 1997; Kelboro and Stellmacher 2015). Thus, negative or positive views and attitudes of local people towards community versus state forests will likely affect their contribution and participation {{in the management of}} forests. Views and attitudes of local people can be affected by their behaviours (Jotte 1997; Woltamo 1997; Kellert et al. 2000). Hence, understanding how behaviour affects views and attitudes of local people is of paramount importance for conservation and sustainable utilization of forests through introducing and implementing appropriate <b>forest</b> management and <b>governance,</b> especially in developing countries, such as Ethiopia, where local people are directly dependent on forest resources to meet their needs (Tesfaye et al. 2012; Ameha et al. 2014; Tadesse and Teketay 2017).|$|R
30|$|This study {{investigated}} appropriate management strategies and techniques about community versus state forests in Tehulederi District. This may assist forest managers, local communities, and {{private and public}} sectors in addressing opportunities and challenges for conserving and managing forests. Other than academic purposes, {{it is believed that}} {{the findings of this study}} generated quantitative and qualitative scientific information for policy-makers and planners that guide them towards better and more informed decision-making for the establishment of community versus state <b>forests</b> <b>governance</b> and implementation that is geared towards communal forest management and, thereby, to achieve the broader goal of poverty reduction in Ethiopia. Therefore, effective conservation and sustainable use of forests need the full involvement of many stakeholders, including the local communities.|$|R

30|$|Restoring the {{degraded}} {{sites with}} vegetation cover is an optimal solution to mitigate environmental disasters. Starting from the 1980 s, donor-assisted land rehabilitation activities {{were taking place}} in Tehulederi District, South Wollo, Ethiopia. Meanwhile, majority of the forests were destroyed; {{part of the problem}} was associated with the top-down approach of forest management. The challenge is, therefore, to find a system of management that can enhance the combined effect of both the community and the state. The community forestry (i.e. a forest development activity which is practiced and managed collectively by the community members on their communal land) is one such alternative. The objectives of the study were to (1) examine the views and attitudes of local people towards community versus state <b>forests</b> <b>governance</b> and (2) evaluate the management practices implemented in the community versus state forestry and their implications on the forest status and the livelihood of local people.|$|R

30|$|Generally, {{views and}} attitudes of local people towards {{community}} and state forests can be positively influenced by increasing their knowledge and benefits (Agarwal 2001; Elias 2004; Tesfaye 2011; Tesfaye et al. 2012; Kelboro and Stellmacher 2015; Tadesse and Teketay 2017). More importantly, public awareness programmes and conservation education can assist in improving the views {{and attitudes of}} young people towards community and state <b>forests</b> <b>governance</b> and management. Promoting direct participation of local residents in decision-making and implementation of appropriate community and state forests strategic plans can also mitigate potential conflicts and assure long-term public supports towards the management of forests. Hence, by comparing views and attitudes quantified and presented in this baseline study as well as results from future replication of this study, researchers can provide relevant quantitative and qualitative information for decision-makers and forest conservation managers to deal with potential conflict of interests between community versus state forests {{and the needs of}} the local people.|$|R

40|$|A {{practice}} based {{approach is}} new to studies of <b>forest</b> and nature <b>governance</b> and fairly new to governance studies in general. In this chapter, we outline the promise of such an approach for such studies. The chapter is in two parts. Firstly, a number of conclusions are drawn from the preceding individual chapters. They relate to: (1) the types of <b>forest</b> and nature <b>governance</b> practices that can be empirically distinguished; (2) the way the sensitising concepts of logic of practice, situated agency, and performativity {{have been used to}} move beyond mainstream governance approaches; and (3) the specific characteristics of a practice based approach to <b>forest</b> and nature <b>governance.</b> The second part of the chapter discusses the academic and societal value of the practice based approach as offered in this book, firstly by comparing this approach to an interpretative approach in governance studies and addressing similarities and differences, and then by discussing whether the practice based approach can contribute to policy making and steering social change. We conclude that a practice based approach can convincingly address some points that mainstream accounts of governance cannot, but only if certain long-held convictions about what governance really is are abandoned...|$|R

40|$|Provisioning {{services}} are major environmental {{services provided by}} forests. Especially in tropical countries, the livelihoods of local people often partly depend {{on a range of}} timber and non-timber <b>forest</b> products. The <b>governance</b> arrangements concerning such locally valued environmental {{services are}} complex and include multilevel centres of authority. They do not only concern policies and regulations formulated by national and international organisations but also local norms and rules for formulating and implementing a set of management practices to organise and control the access to resources and their markets. This chapter presents a case study of the role of forest provisioning services for local communities and how this is reflected in a dynamic and multilevel system of <b>forest</b> resource <b>governance.</b> The case study concerns the production of honey in the mountain forests of Southwest Ethiopia. Based on experiences of an NTFP development programme and related field studies and literature, this chapter first describes the forests and livelihood conditions in this region, emphasising the multiple environmental services provided by forests to local people. Next, it specifies the role of forests for honey production and the different governance arrangements for its production and marketing. Local people actively manage both bees and tree vegetation; these practices have gradually been intensified. Beekeeping has not only contributed to forest conservation but also {{to the development of a}} forested landscape consisting of a mosaic of natural and adapted <b>forest</b> types. The <b>governance</b> complex is increasingly impacted by external systems of environmental governance.
