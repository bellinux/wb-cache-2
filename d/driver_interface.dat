5|$|HSV E Series 3 or E3 {{commenced}} {{sales in}} 2011. Model {{changes for the}} E series 3 include an option for LPI system (for an extra $5990) allowing the vehicle to run on LPG and unleaded petrol; the LPI system is not available on the ClubSport R8 Tourer. Cosmetic changes include a new spoiler and revised exhaust tips. HSV E Series 3 models reach 0-100kmp in 5.8 seconds. The HSV E Series 3 introduced the new HSV Enhanced Driver Interface; {{it has the same}} interface as the Holden IQ (found in VE Series II Commodores) but with added function. The system allows users to access the car's computer and monitor fuel consumption, stability, g-force and vehicle dynamics. Other functions include data logging options, digital gauge displays, stopwatch, driver and racing options, along with controls for the Grange's Bi-Modal exhaust and Side Blind-Zone Alert. The HSV Enhanced <b>Driver</b> <b>Interface</b> and satellite navigation is standard across the E series 3 range.|$|E
5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced <b>Driver</b> <b>Interface.</b> External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E
25|$|Driver input unit: The driver inputs train related data such as {{the type}} of braking (passenger/freight), braking potential, maximum train speed, and train length on the <b>driver</b> <b>interface</b> unit. This is then {{displayed}} to the driver to verify that it is correct.|$|E
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 2: History of {{developing}} high-speed LCD <b>driver</b> <b>interfaces</b> ...|$|R
50|$|However, as full HD {{televisions}} {{were launched}} in 2005 and full HD with double frame rate in 2007, higher-speed demands in high-definition televisions have required advanced technologies in <b>driver</b> <b>interfaces.</b> In such situation, new LCD <b>driver</b> <b>interfaces</b> such as Advanced PPmL and CalDriCon have appeared {{to solve the}} constraints of high-speed technologies.|$|R
50|$|In around 2000, LCD-panels often {{selected}} high-speed <b>driver</b> <b>interfaces</b> such as mini-LVDS, {{developed by}} Texas Instruments, and RSDS (Reduced Swing Differential Signaling), developed by National Semiconductor.|$|R
25|$|The Electrical Team is {{responsible}} for designing, building, and programming all of the electrical systems of the car. This includes the batteries, power trackers, <b>driver</b> <b>interface,</b> telemetry systems, and the electric motor that drives the car. The primary goal of the Electrical Team is efficiency; the less power a device uses, the longer the car {{will be able to}} go.|$|E
500|$|A mildly cosmetically altered E Series 3 was {{released}} in September 2010, and with it a special 20 years of Maloo edition limited to just 100 examples, featuring unique exterior equipment, including matte black 'Vector E' vents on the front guards and bonnet, 20-inch GTS alloy wheels, bi-modal exhaust system, Side Blind Zone Alert (SBZA), and new hero colours, including 'Hazard' yellow. The interior of the 20th anniversary Maloo features special leather upholstery, satellite navigation, Enhanced <b>Driver</b> <b>Interface</b> (EDI), and a specific rear window decal and numbered build plate. Will be available in North America in July 2015 ...|$|E
500|$|... 2010 saw {{the arrival}} of the E3 HSV range which brought with it a raft of {{interior}} changes shared with the VE Series II upgrade of HSV's donor vehicle, the Holden Commodore, such as the new Holden iQ audio/infotainment system and safety features such as Side Blind zone alert. It also brought HSV's Enhanced <b>Driver</b> <b>Interface</b> (EDI) system to the Senator, a system that constantly streams real-time vehicle dynamics and performance information to the touch screen in the centre console. The exterior remained mostly unchanged from the E2 model apart from the move to a 20" [...] forged alloy that was available in Dark Stainless or Gloss Black. The LS3 was upgraded to [...] with the fitment of the E2 GTS' bi-modal exhaust system. The E3 was also available with the upgraded 6-piston brakes from the GTS and had the option of a modern LPG fuel system called LPI (Liquid Propane Injection) to help reduce the running costs.|$|E
50|$|Among new LCD <b>driver</b> <b>interfaces,</b> CalDriCon {{satisfies}} both {{of high-speed}} requirements of 2.0 Gbit/s/lane and noise tolerances against unstable power sources and grounds {{as well as}} auto-adjustment of skew between clock and data.|$|R
50|$|In addition, CalDriCon {{and many}} other {{advanced}} <b>driver</b> <b>interfaces</b> adopt Point-to-Point connection that brings much less distortion of signal integrity even in the multi-drop connection than mini-LVDS that is often affected by noise because of its bus topology.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hardware}} is also {{incorporated into}} the file hierarchy. Device <b>drivers</b> <b>interface</b> to user applications via an entry in the [...] or [...] directories. Process information as well is mapped to the file system through the [...] directory.|$|R
2500|$|In July 2005, HSV also {{produced}} a manual-only Clubsport and Clubsport R8 [...] "Dealer Team Spec" [...] (DTS), comprising Stage 1 and optional Stage 2 packages. Stage 1 included upgraded tyre and wheel package, lighter overall weight and Stage 2 included other upgrades such as enhanced <b>driver</b> <b>interface,</b> adjustable suspension and tyre pressure monitors.|$|E
2500|$|APIs such as Direct3D and DirectSound need to {{interact}} with hardware, and they do this through a device driver. [...] Hardware manufacturers have to write these drivers for a particular DirectX version's device <b>driver</b> <b>interface</b> (or DDI), and test each individual piece of hardware to make them DirectX compatible. Some hardware devices have only DirectX compatible drivers (in other words, one must install DirectX {{in order to use}} that hardware). Early versions of DirectX included an up-to-date library of all of the DirectX compatible drivers currently available. This practice was stopped however, in favor of the web-based Windows Update driver-update system, which allowed users to download only the drivers relevant to their hardware, rather than the entire library.|$|E
2500|$|The Lexus LF line is {{a series}} of concept cars built by Lexus, the luxury vehicle {{division}} of Toyota Motor Corporation. The [...] "LF" [...] designation refers to Lexus Future. The LF Series vehicles features coupes/convertibles, including: the LF-A, the LF-A Roadster, LF-LC, LF-CC, and the LF-C; sedans: the LF-S, LF-Sh, and LF-Gh; crossover SUVs: the LF-X and LF-Xh; and hatchbacks: the LF-Ch. The first concept vehicle of the LF Series, the LF-X, appeared in 2003. The LF Series utilizes L-finesse, a design philosophy named for [...] "Leading Edge" [...] and [...] "finesse", which debuted on the LF Series concepts and later extended to all new production Lexus vehicles. New vehicle technologies on the LF Series include advanced instrumentation, multiple driver-selected vehicle configurations, hybrid and experimental powertrains, and unconventional <b>driver</b> <b>interface</b> designs. The vehicles also feature new design cues which derive from the L-finesse design language of [...] "Intriguing Elegance" [...] (純), [...] "Incisive Simplicity" [...] (妙), and [...] "Seamless Anticipation" [...] (予). Several of the LF concept vehicles have appeared close to their production counterparts, while the design cues of other LF concepts appeared on more distinctly different production vehicles.|$|E

2500|$|The Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) was {{introduced}} {{as part of}} the Wired for Management framework by Intel and is described in the specification published by Intel and SystemSoft. PXE version 2.0 was released in December 1998, and the update 2.1 was made public in September 1999. The PXE environment makes use of several standard client‑server protocols like DHCP and TFTP (now defined by the 1992 published RFC 1350). Within the PXE schema the client [...] side of the provisioning equation is now {{an integral part of the}} PXE standard and it is implemented either as a Network Interface Card (NIC) BIOS extension or today in modern devices as UEFI code. This distinctive firmware layer makes available at the client the functions of a basic Universal Network <b>Driver</b> <b>Interface</b> (UNDI), a minimalistic UDP/IP stack, a Preboot (DHCP) client module and a TFTP client module, together forming the PXE application programming interfaces (APIs) used by the NBP when needing to interact with the services offered by the server counterpart of the PXE environment. TFTP's low throughput, especially when used over high-latency links, has been initially mitigated by the TFTP Blocksize Option RFC 2348 published in May 1998, and later by the TFTP Windowsize Option RFC 7440 published in January 2015.|$|E
