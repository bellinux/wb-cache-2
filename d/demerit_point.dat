25|$|The school {{continues}} to maintain strong discipline with a strict {{set of rules}} and regulations. Disciplinary measures {{are based on the}} Raffles Online Discipline system, introduced in 2011 and adapted from the Year 5 - 6 Section. Prior to the present system, student records were maintained based on a <b>demerit</b> <b>point</b> system, with Reformative Work Order and detention sessions for repeat offenders. These systems are primarily targeted at petty offences. Current school rules include prohibitions on eating and possessing sweetened drinks outside the canteen, physical activity in school uniform (as opposed to PE attire), and changing in class. The discipline framework is administered by the Discipline Master, in collaboration with the RIPB, for Year 1-4 students, and the Assistant Department Head (ADH) for Discipline for Year 5-6 students. For more serious offences, all male students are liable to receive corporal punishment in the form of caning if necessary.|$|E
500|$|From 1970 to 1973, much {{legislation}} {{passed through the}} South Australian Parliament. Workers saw increases in welfare, drinking laws were further liberalised, an Ombudsman was created, censorship was liberalised, seat belts were made mandatory, the education system was overhauled, and the public service was gradually increased (doubling in size during the Dunstan era). Adelaide's water supply was fluoridated in 1971 {{and the age of}} majority was lowered from 21 to 18. A Commissioner of Consumer Affairs was created, a <b>demerit</b> <b>point</b> system was introduced to penalise poor driving practices in an attempt to cut the road toll, and compensation for workers was improved. Police autonomy and powers were restricted following a rally in opposition to the Vietnam War, which was broken up by police, although Dunstan had wanted the demonstrators to be able to close off the street. A royal commission was called into the police commissioner's disregard for Dunstan's orders, and resulted in legislation giving the government more control over the police; the commissioner then retired. The dress code for the Parliament was relaxed during this period, the suit and tie was no longer seen as obligatory, and Dunstan himself caused media frenzy when he arrived at Parliament House in 1972 wearing pink shorts that ended above his knees. After his departure from public life he admitted that his sartorial statement may have gone beyond the limits. Nevertheless, his fashion sense resulted in his being voted [...] "the sexiest political leader in Australia" [...] by Woman's Day in 1975, and the image of Dunstan in the shorts remains iconic.|$|E
40|$|<b>Demerit</b> <b>points</b> {{systems in}} Europe: room for improvement; Some {{recommendations}} from the European project BestPoint. Broadly speaking, a <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> system involves a road user receiving <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> {{in addition to}} the regular punishment when a traffic violation has been observed. If someone has received a certain number of <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> within a certain period of time, the driver’s licence will be temporarily suspended. <b>Demerit</b> <b>points</b> systems aim at regular offenders and for this reason they are generally considered to be fair. This may be the explanation for their considerable popularity. Three quarters of the European Member States use some form of <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> system. At present, the Netherlands has a simple variant which only applies to novice drivers. Recently, the European project BestPoint has concluded a two-year study into <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> systems which resulted in a handbook for governments who are considering to implement a <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> system. BestPoint investigated the actual effectiveness of a <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> system and which type of system may be expected to be the most satisfactory. The most important conclusion is that <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> systems are less effective than their popularity in Europe suggests. Initially, they have a considerable road safety effect, but their deterrence often is only short-lasting. However, the effectiveness of a <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> system may be improved by setting it up in a good way; {{it is very important that}} both the objective and the subjective risk of being caught remain high and that automatically detected offences are also included...|$|R

While the <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> have no official impact on insurance rates, most insurance providers {{will increase the}} rate charged to a driver in response to <b>demerit</b> <b>points.</b> The <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> are used by the Ministry of Transportation to determine licence suspensions due to repeated traffic violations (Effects on Ontario insurance rates and eligibility are typically measured {{by the number of}} tickets received in recent years, rather than the associated points).|$|R
5000|$|In the {{province}} of Ontario, drivers who are convicted of certain driving related offences result in <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> recorded onto their driving records. It is commonly misconceived that drivers actually [...] "lose" [...] points due to convictions for certain traffic offences. In fact, a driver begins with zero <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> and accumulates <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> for convictions. <b>Demerit</b> <b>points</b> stay on a driver's record for two years from the original offence date.

40|$|In 2012, 21 of the 27 EU Member States {{had some}} form of <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> system. In theory, <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> systems {{contribute}} to road safety through three mechanisms: 1) prevention of unsafe behaviour through the risk of receiving penalty points, 2) selection and suspension of the most frequent offenders and 3) correction of risk behaviour through an educative element in the <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> system. International studies show that in practice {{the effects of a}} <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> system can indeed be significant, but that these effects exist only for a (very) limited period of time. Since 2002, the Netherlands has had a simple <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> system for novice drivers and since 2011 for drink driving as well. A condition for a lasting effect of <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> systems is a large – and continuous – objective and subjective probability of actual withdrawal of the driver’s licence. This probability is closely connected to a sufficiently high level of enforcement, efficient methods of enforcement and frequently returning publicity on the enforcement and the number of people whose licence has been withdrawn...|$|R

40|$|A {{progressive}} {{penalty system}} encompasses heavier or more far-reaching sanctions being imposed as one commits more offences. A progressive penalty system {{is often called}} a progressive fines system if it involves increasingly higher financial penalties (fines), but (other) recidivism schemes such as <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> systems {{can also be seen}} as a progressive penalty systems. The Netherlands has no general <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> system such as England, France and Germany have, but it does have a <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> system for novice drivers, a <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> system for alcohol offenders, a scheme for repeat-offenders and recidivism schemes for various other serious traffic violations. Research shows us that progressive sanctions in the form of <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> systems have a positive road safety effect with a duration of up to 1. 5 years. The road safety effect of progressive (financial) fines has not as such been investigated in the Netherlands nor in other countries. A scenario analysis indicates that a progressive fines system could save 5 % of the road deaths per year. Research shows that there is considerable public support for the introduction of a general <b>demerit</b> <b>points</b> system; citizens and experts also seem to support a progressive fines system. On 20 June 2017 the Minister of of Security and Justice in the Netherlands has announced to investigate the possibility to introduce a progressive fines system on licence plate. This would make it possible to punish repeat traffic offences that fall under the ‘Administrative Law enforcement traffic regulations’ (Wahv, also called 'Mulder Law') with progressive fines that are dealt with by the Central Fine Collection Agency (CJIB) ...|$|R
