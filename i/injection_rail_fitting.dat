40|$|These day {{diesel engines}} are gaining lots of {{attention}} as prime movers for various source of transportation. It offers better drive ability, very good low end torque and importantly the lower CO 2 emission. Diesel engines are {{bridging the gap}} between gasoline and diesel engines. Better noise vibration and harshness levels of gasoline engine are realized to great extent in diesel engine, thanks to common <b>rail</b> direct <b>injection</b> system. Common <b>rail</b> <b>injection</b> system is now well known entity. Its unique advantage is flexible in operation. In common <b>rail</b> <b>injection</b> system, number of injection prior and after main injection at different injection pressure is possible. Due to multiple injections, gain in emission reduction as well as noise has been already experienced and demonstrated by researcher in the past. However, stringent emission norms for diesel engine equipped vehicle demands for further lower emission of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). In the present paper, authors attempted to study the effect of multiple injections in combination with two level of compression ratio. The aim was to study the combustion behavior with the reduced compression ratio {{which is going to}} be tried out as low temperature combustion concept in near future. The results were compared with the current level of compression ratio. Experiments were carried out in 2. 2 L cubic capacity engine with two levels of compression ratios. Pilot injection separation and quantities were varied keeping the main <b>injection,</b> <b>rail</b> pressure, boost pressure and EGR rate constant. Cylinder pressure traces and gross heat release rates were measured and analyzed to understand the combustion behavior...|$|R

40|$|Common <b>rail</b> <b>injection</b> {{systems are}} {{becoming}} a more widely used solution in the fuel systems of modern diesel engines. The main component and the characteristic feature {{of the system is}} <b>rail</b> <b>injection</b> of the fuel under high pressure, which is passed to the injector and further to the combustion chamber. An important element in this process is the high-pressure pump, continuing adequate pressure in the <b>rail</b> <b>injection</b> system. Common <b>rail</b> (CR) systems are being modified in order to optimise their work and virtual simulations are a useful tool in order to analyze the correctness of operation of the system while varying the parameters and settings, without any negative impact on the real object. In one particular study, a computer simulation of the pump high-pressure CR system was made in MatLab environment, based on the actual dimensions of the object – a one-cylinder diesel engine, the Farymann Diesel 18 W. The resulting model consists of two parts – the first is responsible for simulating the operation of the high-pressure pump, and the second responsible for simulation of the remaining elements of the CR system. The results of this simulation produced waveforms of the following parameters: fluid flow from the manifold to the injector [m 3 /s], liquid flow from the manifold to the atmosphere [m 3 /s], and manifold pressure [Pa]. The simulation results allow for a positive verification of the model and the resulting system could become a useful element of simulation of the entire position and control algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Alternative {{fuels and}} {{injection}} technologies are a necessary component of particulate emission reduction strategies for compression ignition engines. Consequently, this study undertakes a physicochemical characterization of diesel particulate matter (DPM) for engines equipped with alternative injection technologies (direct <b>injection</b> and common <b>rail)</b> and alternative fuels (ultra low sulfur diesel, a 20 % biodiesel blend, and a synthetic diesel). Particle physical properties were addressed by measuring particle number size distributions, and particle chemical properties were addressed by measuring {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Particle volatility was determined by passing the polydisperse size distribution through a thermodenuder set to 300 °C. The results from this study, conducted over a four point test cycle, showed that both fuel type and injection technology {{have an impact on}} particle emissions, but injection technology was the more important factor. Significant particle number emission (54 %- 84 %) reductions were achieved at half load operation (1 % increase- 43 % decrease at full load) with the common <b>rail</b> <b>injection</b> system; however, the particles had a significantly higher PAH fraction (by a factor of 2 to 4) and ROS concentrations (by a factor of 6 to 16) both expressed on a test-cycle averaged basis. The results of this study have significant implications for the health effects of DPM emissions from both direct <b>injection</b> and common <b>rail</b> engines utilizing various alternative fuels...|$|R
