Therfore in this I beleave there happeneth a very rare thing, namely, that the meane is more commendable, then the excellency.|$|E

25|$|There {{is a small}} {{community}} of Swedish-speaking immigrants in Finland. Many of them come from Sweden, or have resided there (about 8,500 Swedish citizens live in Finland and around 30,000 residents in Finland were born in Sweden), while others have opted for Swedish {{because it is the}} main language in the city in which they live, or because their partners are Swedish-speaking. About one quarter of immigrants in the Helsinki area would choose to integrate in Swedish if they had the option. According to a report by Finland's Swedish think tank, Magma, there is a widespread perception among immigrants that they are more easily integrated in the Swedish-speaking community than in the majority society. However, some immigrants also question whether they <b>ever</b> <b>will</b> be fully accepted as Finland Swedes. Swedish-speaking immigrants also have their own association, Ifisk and in the capital region there is a publicly financed project named Delaktig aimed at facilitating integration of immigrants who know or wish to learn Swedish. Most if not all immigrants also wish to be fluent in Finnish {{due to the fact that}} it is the dominant language in Finnish society.|$|E

500|$|Some {{complain}} that the sculpture does not depict Jordan's well-known open-mouthed tongue wag. Chicago Tribune art critic Alan G. Artner says the inscription at the base that reads [...] "The best there ever was. The best there <b>ever</b> <b>will</b> be." [...] refers only to the subject and not the sculpture. [...] Following the Bulls' second three-peat after Jordan's return, the statue became a sports mecca for fans to gather and take photographs. ESPN The Magazine listed the sculpture {{as one of the}} ten greatest sports photo opportunities in 1998.|$|E

500|$|While the {{sculpture}} was {{a work in}} progress, {{the location of the}} sculptor's rented studio was kept secret from the public, while the husband-and-wife sculptor team and three assistants spent four months working for sixteen hours every day of the week. The process involved two sittings with Jordan for measurements and photos, including one in which the clay version had to be driven from Chicago to Nashville, to ensure the accuracy of the clay likeness. The [...] sculpture, which is [...] tall, rests on a 5-foot high black granite base that has an inscription reading [...] "The best there ever was. The best there <b>ever</b> <b>will</b> be." [...] The base also includes a list of his accomplishments. The bronze statue used lost-wax casting. The sculpture has led to a lot of similar work for the couple.|$|E
500|$|Le Guin {{described}} {{coming of}} age as the main theme of the book, and wrote in a 1973 essay that she chose that theme since she was writing for an adolescent audience. She stated that [...] "Coming of age... {{is a process that}} took me many years; I finished it, so far as I <b>ever</b> <b>will,</b> at about age thirty-one; and so I feel rather deeply about it. So do most adolescents. It's their main occupation, in fact." [...] She also said that fantasy was best suited as a medium for describing {{coming of age}}, because exploring the subconscious was difficult using the language of [...] "rational daily life". The coming of age that Le Guin focused on included not just psychological development, but moral changes as well. Ged needs to recognize the balance between his power and his responsibility to use it well, a recognition which comes as he travels to the stone of Terrenon and sees the temptation that that power represents.|$|E

500|$|The June 1888 {{issue of}} Steinitz's International Chess Magazine {{contained}} {{an article by}} Gossip that Robert John McCrary calls [...] "a very illuminating, important, and detailed account {{of the state of}} San Francisco chess". For the last few months of 1888 Gossip was listed as being on the [...] "Editorial Staff" [...] of the Columbia Chess Chronicle. Its December 29, 1888 issue contained a lengthy article by him entitled [...] "Chess in the Present Day", which offered a broad sweep of chess history and the advances made by chess in the United States. Gossip called Paul Morphy and Steinitz [...] "the two greatest chessplayers that have ever lived" [...] and remarked that [...] "no Englishman has yet attained, or probably <b>ever</b> <b>will</b> attain, to the eminence of chess champion of the world....

500|$|The Marshalls never officially adopted Morrison {{because they}} {{believed}} that {{to go through the}} procedure while his parents were still living would appear unusual to the public. Wanting to keep the situation private, they instead made a special arrangement with his parents. President Wilson felt obliged to acknowledge the boy as theirs and sent the couple a note that simply said, [...] "With congratulations to the baby. Wilson". Morrison lived with the Marshalls {{for the rest of his}} life. In correspondence they referred to him as Morrison Marshall, but in person they called him Izzy. Lois took him to see many doctors and spent all her available time trying to nurse him back to health, but his condition worsened and he died in February 1920, just before his fourth birthday. His death devastated Marshall, who wrote in his memoir that Izzy [...] "was and is and <b>ever</b> <b>will</b> be so sacred to me".|$|E
500|$|Chivers is {{best known}} for his {{association}} with Edgar Allan Poe and, in fact, it is through this relationship that Chivers and his work was rediscovered in the 20th century. The first interaction between the two was in 1840 though they did not meet until 1845 in New York. The two became friends and Chivers was willing to give Poe lifetime financial support if he moved to the South. Chivers appreciated Poe's ability and wrote that George Rex Graham was seriously underpaying Poe for his work on Graham's Magazine. [...] "He ought to give you ten thousand dollars a year... It is richly worth it... is greatly indebted to you. It is not my opinion that you have ever been, or <b>ever</b> <b>will</b> be, paid for your intellectual labours. You need never expect it, until you establish a Magazine of your own", he wrote, referring to Poe's plans to begin The Stylus. Even so, Chivers was concerned about Poe's reputation as a severe literary critic, cautioning him about [...] "when you tomahawk people". Poe, in fact, had been hoping Chivers would lend his wealth as a financial backer for The Stylus and possibly even serve as a co-editor in its early planning stages. Chivers considered Poe's proposal but was not able to accept because of the death of his three-year-old daughter just over a week later.|$|E
