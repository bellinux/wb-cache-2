Conrad is alive and well, and explains that he initiated the game to get his brother to embrace life and not to end up like their father. Nicholas bursts into tears, relaxes, and begins to enjoy the party once his shock has dissipated. When he sees that Christine has left the party, he follows her outside to her cab. He asks her to dinner, and she offers to share a coffee with him before her flight takes her to her next game assignment in Australia.|$|E

500|$|Across her {{speaking}} appearances, Lightning is {{voiced by}} Ali Hillis in English and Maaya Sakamoto in Japanese. Sakamoto {{was impressed by}} Lightning, whom she called [...] "cold" [...] and [...] "strong". She was asked to portray Lightning's strength and to betray the character's hidden vulnerabilities. She initially found it strange to voice Lightning, as {{she was used to}} gentler roles such as Aerith Gainsborough, a central character in Final Fantasy VII and its companion media. Commenting on the difficulty of balancing Lightning's depiction as a woman and a professionally trained warrior, Kitase noted that Sakamoto's acting helped to bring out Lightning's femininity. Hillis was given the role of Lightning after speaking a few of the character's lines during audition, and was then given a book about the Final Fantasy XIII universe, which she found a little [...] "overwhelming" [...] when she read it. One of the challenges Hillis faced was recapturing the emotion and energy of Sakamoto's Japanese performance in the character's English rendition. She tried to help the staff of the XIII games portray Lightning as a real person: [...] "I think that was my main priority, to make sure that Lightning had every single layer of who she was as a person, not <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> character, but a real person with layers and history and relationships to every single character in the game...even the Chocobo!" [...] Over the course of the XIII trilogy, Hillis felt that Lightning becomes [...] "a little more sarcastic ... a little more hardened to everything that's going on around her and ... into a real warrior".|$|E

2500|$|Some Christians feel {{concerned}} about the modern celebration of Halloween because they feel it trivializes– or celebrates– paganism, the occult, or other practices and cultural phenomena deemed incompatible with their beliefs. Father Gabriele Amorth, an exorcist in Rome, has said, [...] "if English and American children like to dress up as witches and devils on one night of the year {{that is not a}} problem. If it is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>game,</b> there is no harm in that." [...] In more recent years, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has organized a [...] "Saint Fest" [...] on Halloween. Similarly, many contemporary Protestant churches view Halloween as a fun event for children, holding events in their churches where children and their parents can dress up, play games, and get candy for free. To these Christians, Halloween holds no threat to the spiritual lives of children: being taught about death and mortality, and the ways of the Celtic ancestors actually being a valuable life lesson and a part of many of their parishioners' heritage. Christian minister Sam Portaro wrote that Halloween is about using [...] "humor and ridicule to confront the power of death".|$|E
