5|$|At home, the U.S. {{experienced}} sustained {{economic expansion}} and a {{rapid growth of}} its population and middle class. Construction of an Interstate Highway System transformed the nation's infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved from farms and <b>inner</b> <b>cities</b> to large suburban housing developments. In 1959 Hawaii became the 50th and last U.S. state added to the country. The growing Civil Rights Movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, sought to end racial discrimination. Meanwhile, a counterculture movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, black nationalism, and the sexual revolution.|$|E

5|$|More people {{joined the}} middle class in the 1950s, with more money to spend, and the {{availability}} of consumer goods expanded along with the economy, including the automobile. Americans were spending more time in their automobiles and viewing them as an extension of their identity, which helped to fuel a boom in automobile sales. Most businesses directly or indirectly related to the auto industry saw tremendous growth during the decade. New designs and innovations appealed to a generation tuned into fashion and glamour, and the new-found freedom and way of life in the suburbs had several unforeseen consequences for the <b>inner</b> <b>cities.</b> The 1950s saw the beginning of white flight and urban sprawl, driven by increasing automobile ownership. Many local and national transportation laws encouraged suburbanization, which in time ended up damaging the cities economically.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1970s, the CTW's main non-television efforts {{changed from}} {{promotion}} {{to the development}} of educational materials for preschool settings. Early efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the <b>inner</b> <b>cities,</b> in Appalachia, in Native American communities, and in migrant worker camps. During the early 1980s, the CTW created the Preschool Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the series as an educational resource. The Workshop also provided materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Starting during 2006, the Workshop expanded its programs by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs largely concerning how military deployment affects the families of soldiers. Other efforts by the Workshop concerned families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.|$|E
5|$|Winter in America juxtaposes {{themes of}} nostalgic hope {{to the social}} {{problems}} of the early 1970s, particularly in the African-American community and <b>inner</b> <b>cities.</b> Also a prominent theme in Scott-Heron's lyrics is people's faith in their culture in a bleak, impoverished environment. The album features Scott-Heron's examination of maintaining one's cultural roots in a discouraging environment. Other themes include love, fatherhood, freedom, alcoholism, and political scandal. The themes of social disillusionment and the human condition featured on the album are also depicted on the Winter collage, representing the grim, sullen images of poverty, decay, and death in generally urban areas and ghettos. Created by artist Peggy Harris, the collage was featured on the original LP's inner sleeve and in the liner booklet of Winter in Americas CD reissue.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} of the daily realities of childhood in the Johannesburg <b>inner</b> <b>city,</b> investigating how the children understand and negotiate the possible dangers and probable safeties of the <b>inner</b> <b>city.</b> Growing up in the <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> is an image few think is possible. However, throughout my research I will argue for a conceptualisation of childhood that speaks to the urban public spaces in the Johannesburg <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> and an <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> that speaks to the a new childhood in South Africa. I have used danger and safety negotiation as the bridge between studies of the Johannesburg <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> and studies of a South African childhood, and as a bridge in the gap between theories on childhood and theories on the city. I investigate the ways that the children negotiate the everyday dangers in the city and develop practices of safety, and how these practices and avoidance techniques speak to the reality of living in the <b>inner</b> <b>city.</b> The very nature of the congested <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> offers a freedom that many suburban childhoods lack, and that the children experience an independent mobility within an infamously dangerous space speaks to the changes within the <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> often hidden behind the skewed opinion of many of the Johannesburg <b>inner</b> <b>city.</b> I make a claim that the <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> offers more freedom of mobility that is expected. This mobility is a relatively simple and well practiced form of creating visibility within the pedestrian congestion of the city. These practises of visibility, I argue, is heavily reliant on the layout of the <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> {{and the ways in which}} children understand the dangers that face them. As such, their safety practices are a complex network of sharing cautionary stories and avoidance techniques. For most children, this environment is also the only space that they know and therefore, what to outsiders might seem a dangerous, chaotic and confusing space is to the children just their everyday experience. These are the stories about which I write...|$|R
25|$|Many African-American {{neighborhoods are}} located in <b>inner</b> <b>cities,</b> {{and these are the}} mostly {{residential}} neighborhoods located closest to the central business district. The built environment is often row houses or brownstones, mixed with older single-family homes that may be converted to multi-family homes. In some areas there are larger apartment buildings.

This African-American house design is found in both rural and urban southern areas, mainly in African-American communities and neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|In {{many parts}} of the {{developed}} world, suburbs can be economically distressed areas, inhabited by higher proportions of recent immigrants, with higher delinquency rates and social problems. Sometimes the notion of suburb may even refer to people in real misery, who are kept at the limit of the city borders for economic, social, and sometimes ethnic reasons. An example in the developed world would be the banlieues of France, or the concrete suburbs of Sweden, even if the suburbs of these countries also include middle-class and upper-class neighborhoods that often consist of single-family houses. Thus some of the suburbs of most of the developed world are comparable to several <b>inner</b> <b>cities</b> of the U.S. and Canada.|$|E
25|$|From its {{earliest}} days, Buenos Aires depended primarily on trade.

Because of this, products took {{a very long time}} to arrive in Buenos Aires, and the taxes generated by the transport made them prohibitive. This scheme frustrated the traders of Buenos Aires, and a thriving informal yet accepted by the authorities contraband industry developed inside the colonies and with the Portuguese. This also instilled a deep resentment among porteños towards the Spanish authorities.|$|E
