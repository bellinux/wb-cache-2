50|$|The pygmy {{hippopotamus}} (Choeropsis <b>liberiensis</b> or <b>Hexaprotodon</b> <b>liberiensis)</b> {{is a small}} hippopotamid which is native to the forests and swamps of West Africa, primarily in Liberia, with small populations in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Ivory Coast.|$|R
50|$|A {{distinct}} subspecies of {{pygmy hippopotamus}} existed in Nigeria {{until at least}} the 20th century, though the validity {{of this has been}} questioned. The existence of the subspecies, makes Choeropsis <b>liberiensis</b> <b>liberiensis</b> (or <b>Hexaprotodon</b> <b>liberiensis</b> liberiensis under the old classification) the full trinomial nomenclature for the Liberian pygmy hippopotamus. The Nigerian pygmy hippopotamus was never studied in the wild and never captured. All research and all zoo specimens are the Liberian subspecies. The Nigerian subspecies is classified as C. liberiensis heslopi.|$|R

5000|$|Sapo National Park {{contains}} {{populations of}} the pygmy hippopotamus (<b>Hexaprotodon</b> <b>liberiensis),</b> an endangered species which has legal protection in Liberia under the Wildlife and National Park Act of 1988. Unique to West Africa, the wild population of pygmy hippopotamuses is thought to number less than 3,000 individuals. According to the World Conservation Union (IUCN), conservation efforts targeted at the species have [...] "historically been most effective in the Sapo National Park ... where protection is good". According to an action plan published by the IUCN Species Survival Commission, Sapo National Park is [...] "the only realistic choice" [...] of a [...] "of suitable conservation area" [...] for the Pygmy Hippopotamus. In February 2008, automatic heat- and motion-sensing cameras set up in Sapo National Park captured the first photographs of the pygmy hippopotamus ever taken in Liberia.The photographs confirmed the continued presence of the species inside {{the boundaries of the}} park; previously, scientists did not know whether the pygmy hippopotamus population in the park had survived the civil wars and subsequent poaching and logging.|$|R

40|$|Polcystic {{kidney disease}} (PKD) was {{diagnosed}} at necropsy in a captive aged female pygmy hippopotamus (<b>Hexaprotodon</b> <b>liberiensis),</b> which presented with numerous cysts in both kidneys, liver, duodenum and one {{single in the}} pancreas. There were no premonitory clinical signs of a nephropathy observed prior to its death. Similar findings {{were made in the}} male partner animal half a year later. Both animals had been wild-caught. A literature review showed that another seven cases of PKD have been reported in pygmy hippopotamuses, and an additional screening of records available from the international studbook for the species revealed yet another six cases. In all cases, aged females were affected, and in several instances, affected animals were related to each other. These patterns suggested familiar transmission, similar to PKD in humans and other animals. The disease, and especially the presumptive bias in diagnosis towards females – the male animal of this report was to our knowledge the first case of PKD reported in a male pygmy hippopotamus -, warrant further investigation. The status of the kidneys with respect to PKD should be assessed (including histology) in every deceased pygmy hippopotamus...|$|R
40|$|Methane (CH 4) {{production}} varies between herbivore species, but {{reasons for}} this variation remain to be elucidated. Here, we report open-circuit chamber respiration measurements of CH 4 production in four specimens each of two non-ruminant mammalian herbivores with a complex forestomach but largely differing in body size, the collared peccary (Pecari tajacu, mean body mass 17 kg) and the pygmy hippopotamus (<b>Hexaprotodon</b> <b>liberiensis,</b> 229 kg) fed lucerne-based diets. In addition, food intake, digestibility and mean retention times were measured in the same experiments. CH 4 production averaged 8 and 72 L/d, 18 and 19 L/kg dry matter intake, and 4. 0 and 4. 2 % of gross energy intake for the two species, respectively. When compared with previously reported data on CH 4 production in other non-ruminant and ruminant foregut-fermenting as well as hindgut-fermenting species, {{it is evident that}} neither the question whether a species is a foregut fermenter or not, or whether it ruminates or not, is of the relevance previously suggested to explain variation in CH 4 production between species. Rather, differences in CH 4 production between species on similar diets appear related to species-specific differences in food intake and digesta retention kinetics...|$|R
40|$|The curiosity {{whether or}} not animals have the {{characteristics}} of long term planning skills is fairly new. Some researchers agree that certain species have a form of episodic-like memory, {{in the terms of}} where, when and what. But the most difficult thing is to find out if these species have an aim for the future which involves what some call mental time travel. This study {{is a part of the}} discussion if the tests in long term planning and foresight can be explained by associative learning and the ability of self control in highly trained animals. Many self control and delay tasks have been conducted with laboratory animals such as rats, pigeons, monkeys and apes. Here we made a self control test with a reinforcement delay in pygmy hippos (<b>Hexaprotodon</b> <b>liberiensis),</b> an endangered species (listed as vulnerable at Cites, 2000), to extend the test among species. Also for trying to find out more about their cognitive skills, so we can better fulfil their needs in captivity. In this study, the female succeeded in 71, 1 % (27 out of 38 trials) of the opportunities and the male in 84, 2 % (32 out of 38 trials). To our knowledge this is the first study of learning and cognition in Pygmy hippos. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{digestion}} {{of plant}} material in mammalian herbivores basically {{depends on the}} chemical and structural composition of the diet, the mean particle size to which the forage is processed, and the ingesta retention time. These different factors can {{be influenced by the}} animal, and they can presumably compensate for each other. The pygmy hippopotamus, a non-ruminating foregut fermenter, has longer mean retention times than ruminants; however hippos do not achieve higher (fibre) digestibilities on comparable diets, which could be due to ineffective mastication. We performed feeding trials with six pygmy hippos (<b>Hexaprotodon</b> <b>liberiensis)</b> and six banteng cattle (Bos javanicus) on a grass diet. As predicted, both species achieved similar dry matter, organic matter, crude protein and gross energy digestibilities. However, neutral and acid detergent fibre digestibility was lower in pygmy hippos. Apparently, in these species, fibre digestibility was more influenced by particle size, which was larger in pygmy hippos compared to banteng, than by retention time. In spite of their higher relative food intake, the banteng in this study did not have greater relative gut fills than the hippos. Ruminants traditionally appear intake-limited when compared to equids, because feed particles above a certain size cannot leave the rumen. But when compared to nonruminating foregut fermenters, rumination seems to free foregut fermenters from an intrinsic food intake limitation. The higher energy intakes and metabolic rates in wild cattle compared to hippos could have life-history consequences, such as a higher relative reproductive rate...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} {{intake and}} digestibility studies in four common (Hippopotamus amphibius) and four pygmy (<b>Hexaprotodon</b> <b>liberiensis)</b> hippos from two zoological institutions, using acid detergent lignin as an internal marker for the quantification of faecal output. In {{the case of}} one pygmy hippo, where total faecal collection was also possible, there was no distinct {{difference between the two}} methods of faecal output quantification. Two animals from each species were tested on a conventional zoo diet of hay and concentrates (diet HC) and on hay only (diet H). The other two animals received fresh grass at two different levels of intake (diets G 1 and G 2). Dry matter (DM) intake was higher on HC than on H or G diets, and averaged 37 +/- 11 for common and 35 +/- 14 g/kg(0. 75) for pygmy hippos. There were no species differences in the average digestibility (aD) coefficients. Non-dietary faecal nitrogen averaged 65 +/- 4 % of total faecal nitrogen, aD of crude protein (CP) averaged 67 +/- 9 % and true protein digestibility 89 +/- 3 %. Average digestibility of DM and crude fibre averaged 54 +/- 11 % and 45 +/- 17 %, respectively. In comparison with ruminants, hippos generally achieve lower aD for DM, organic matter and fibre parameters, but equal or higher aD CP coefficients. This is most likely due to the absence of significant fermentative activity in the hindgut and the corresponding low metabolic faecal nitrogen losses. Digestible energy intake was higher on HC than on H or G diets and averaged 0. 30 +/- 0. 11 MJ/kg(0. 75) metabolic body mass. This value is extremely low for ungulates, supporting earlier suspicions that hippos have particularly low metabolic rates, and explains the proneness of this species to obesity in captivity when fed energy-dense pelleted feeds...|$|R
40|$|Processing of ingesta {{particles}} plays {{a crucial}} role in the digestive physiology of herbivores. In the ruminant forestomach different sized particles are stratified into a small and a large particle fraction and only the latter is regurgitated and remasticated to smaller, easier-to-digest particles. In contrast, it has been suggested that in non-ruminating foregut fermenters, such as hippopotamuses, larger particles should be selectively excreted since they tend to be digested at a slower rate and hence can be considered intake-limiting bulk. In our study we determined the mean retention time (MRT) of fluids and different sized particles (2 mm and 10 mm) in six pygmy hippos (<b>Hexaprotodon</b> <b>liberiensis)</b> and six banteng (Bos javanicus) on a diet of fresh grass at two intake levels. We used cobalt ethylendiamintetraacetate (Co-EDTA) as fluid and chromium (Cr) -mordanted fibre (2 mm) and cerium (Ce) -mordanted fibre (10 mm) as particle markers, mixed in the food. Average total tract MRT for fluid, small and large particles at the high intake level was 32, 76 and 73 h in pygmy hippos and 25, 56 and 60 h in banteng, and at the low intake level 39, 109, and 105 h in pygmy hippos and 22, 51 and 58 h in banteng, respectively. In accordance with the prediction, large particles moved faster than, or as fast as the small particles, through the gut of pygmy hippos. In contrast, large particles were excreted slower than the small particles in the ruminant of this study, the banteng. Pygmy hippos had longer retention times than the banteng, which probably compensate for the less efficient particle size reduction. Although the results were not as distinct as expected, most likely due to the fact that ingestive mastication of the larger particle marker could not be prevented, they confirm our hypothesis of a functional difference in selective particle retention between ruminating and non-ruminating foregut fermenters...|$|R
40|$|Herbivores that digest plant {{material}} in the fore-stomach can be divided in ruminants and non-ruminants. This study describes the distribution of feed particles (and inorganic material) and dry matter (DM) in the digestive tract of non-ruminant foregut fermenters. Results from passage trials led us to hypothesize that specific particle-sorting mechanisms, as observed in ruminants, are unlikely in non-ruminants. Therefore, no systematic particle size distribution effects (indicative of a sorting mechanism) should be evident in the fore-stomachs of these animals, but differences in fluid and particle retention suggest that differences in fluid concentration (measured as DM) could occur in the foregut of macropods and hippos. The gut content of eleven Bennett’s wallabies (Macropus rufogriseus), six collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu), three pygmy hippos (<b>Hexaprotodon</b> <b>liberiensis),</b> two common hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius) and one two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus) were analysed {{with an emphasis on}} the fore-stomach. The ventral and dorsal regions in sacciform compartments, and peripheral and central regions in tubular compartments, were examined. Results were not uniform across the species studied. A potential sedimentation mechanism was observed firstly by the accumulation of sand in the fore-stomach of the peccary and sloth, and secondly by the lower DM content in peripheral versus central and ventral versus dorsal regions of the fore-stomach of the wallabies and common hippos, respectively. However, pair-comparisons for different gut regions of wallabies and peccaries yielded no differences in mean particle size between fore-stomach regions. To conclude, some digesta fractionation does occur in the fore-stomach of the studied groups of non-ruminants, but not in a uniform manner, which in turn is in accordance with morphological dissimilarities of their respective foregut structures. The absence of systematic fractionation effects in non-ruminant foregut fermenters emphasizes the innovative character of the sorting mechanism in ruminants...|$|R
40|$|Although {{several aspects}} of the {{digestive}} physiology of the hippopotamidae-non-ruminating foregut fermenters-have been described, ingesta kinetics and passage characteristics of these species are not well understood. The most outstanding feature of the hippo digestive physiology reported so far is the very long mean ingesta retention times (MRTs) measured by Foose [Foose, T., 1982. Trophic strategies of ruminant versus nonruminant ungulates. PhD dissertation, University of Chicago, Chicago. ]. Since those data had been investigated with animals without water access, we intended to measure MRT in hippos which were allowed to enter water pools during the night. MRT parameters as well as dry matter (DM) digestibility were determined in four common (Hippopotamus amphibius) and four pygmy hippos (<b>Hexaprotodon</b> <b>liberiensis)</b> on two different diets each using cobalt ethylendiamintetraacetate (Co-EDTA) as a fluid, chromium (Cr) -mordanted fibre (< 2 mm) as a particle and acid detergent lignin (ADL) as an internal digestibility marker. Four of the animals additionally received cerium (Ce) -mordanted fibres (2 - 10 mm) as particle markers. Total MRTs for fluids and particles ranged between 20 - 35 and 48 - 106 h in the common and between 13 - 39 and 32 - 107 h in the pygmy hippos. The difference between fluid and particle retention was greater than usually reported in ruminants. Excretion patterns of the markers differed from those usually observed in ruminants but resembled those reported for macropods (kangaroos), indicating a plug-flow reactor-like physiology in the hippo forestomach (FRST). This finding complements other described similarities between the macropod and the hippo forestomach. The measurements of larger particle retention profiles suggest that in the hippo, larger particles might be excreted either faster or {{at the same rate}} as smaller particles, indicating a general difference between ruminants and hippos with respect to differential particle retention. The digestive physiology of hippos is characterised by a generally low food intake, long ingesta retention times and dry matter digestibilities lower than reported in ruminants. Moderate digestibilities in spite of long retention times might be the result of the generally high average ingesta particle size in hippos. The comparatively easy management of pygmy hippos, together with the significant correlations between food intake, MRT and digestibility in the pygmy hippos of this study, recommends this species for further studies on the interplay of these parameters in herbivore digestive physiology...|$|R
40|$|The total captive {{population}} of the pygmy hippopotamus <b>Hexaprotodon</b> (= Choeropsis) <b>liberiensis</b> had a highly female biased sex ratio at birth (41 % males), which exceeded most other known distorted sex ratios in captive mammals. Deviation from an even sex ratio was not compensated by a higher juvenile mortality of females. I examined possible causes of that deviation and could not find any association between offspring sex and inbreeding, parity, or mother's age. I found, however, {{a significant difference in}} sex ratios among different zoological gardens, suggesting that husbandry influenced sex at birth in the pygmy hippopotamus. Further analysis suggested that high feeding intensity and hands-on husbandry favored production of daughters. However, not all of the observed patterns and relationships could be explained by classic sex ratio theories...|$|R
