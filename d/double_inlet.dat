50|$|The DKS {{procedure}} {{is named for}} three physicians - Paul Damus, Michael Kaye, and H. C. Stansel - who independently reported the procedure in the literature in the 1970s. At that time, the procedure was used for patients who had TGA with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). By the late 2000s, the procedure was employed in situations where the right ventricle is bigger than the left ventricle and the left ventricle connects to the pulmonary artery instead of the aorta; examples include <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> left ventricle, TGA with tricuspid atresia and TGA with hypoplastic left heart syndrome.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the spectrum and associated anomalies of <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> ventricle (single ventricle), echocardiographic data of SO patients with <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> ventricle were reviewed and {{compared with the}} data obtained by cardiac catheterization, cardiac surgery and autopsy. Standard echocardiographic planes were used to {{determine the}} cardiac anatomy {{and the size of the}} interventricular communication. <b>Double</b> <b>inlet</b> by way of two perforate valves was found in 44 patients. In 42 of the 44 patients the dominant ventricular morphology was of the left ventricular type (<b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> left ventricle); in 13 of these 42 patients stenosis of one atrioventricular (AV) valve was found. <b>Double</b> <b>inlet</b> right ventricle and <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> indeterminate ventricle were each found in one patient. <b>Double</b> <b>inlet</b> by way of a common AV valve was found in six patients, all of whom had atrial isomerism. The diagnosis of <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> ventricle was accurate by two-dimensional echocardiography in all 44 patients. A restrictive interventricular communication was shown in 13 patients and a nonrestrictive communication in 17 patients by cardiac catheterization. Patients with a restrictive interventricular communication had a significantly smaller interventricular communication area normalized by the body surface area (mean ± SD 1. 21 ± 0. 53 cm 2 /m 2) than did those with a nonrestrictive interventricular communication (2. 33 ± 0. 71 cm 2 /m 2) (p < 0. 01). Infants with an aortic anomaly had a significantly smaller interventricular communication area (1. 35 ± 0. 65 cm 2 /m 2) than did those without an aortic anomaly (2. 57 ± 0. 76 cm 2 /m 2) (p < 0. 05).

40|$|The {{absence of}} moving {{components}} at low temperature end gives the pulse tube refrigerator(PTR) a great leverage over other cryocoolers like Stirling and G-M refrigerators that are conventionally in use for several decades. PTR has greater reliability;no electric motors to cause electromagnetic interference,no sources of mechanical vibration {{in the cold}} head and no clearance seal between piston and cylinder. Moreover,it is a relatively low cost device with a simple yet compact design. The objectives of the present work is to design,fabricate and test a single stage G-M type pulse tube refrigerator and study its performances. Experimental studies consists of cooling behavior of the refrigeration system at different cold end temperatures and optimization of orifice and <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> openings at different pressures. The developed pulse tube refrigerator consists of compressor,rotary valve, regenerator,pulse tube,hot end heat exchanger,orifice valve and <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> valve,reservoir or buffer,vacuum chamber and coupling accessories etc. Regenerator and pulse tube have been chosen according to the literature available. Hot end heat exchanger has been designed and fabricated {{with respect to the}} regenerator and pulse tube geometry. The assembly of the components has been done {{in such a way that}} the set-up can be used as basic pulse tube refrigerator,orifice pulse tube refrigerator or <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> pulse tube refrigerator as and when required. This has enabled thorough comparison among them. The effect of operating conditions such as average pressure and pressure ratio of the compressor also has been found out. The optimum operating conditions such as opening of the orifice and <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> valves have been selected according to the performance i. e. minimum attainable temperature at no load condition. Effect of orifice and <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> openings at different pressures has been detected by applying the pressure sensors across at various positions in the system.

40|$|The {{concept of}} univentricular heart moved from hearts {{with only one}} {{ventricle}} connected with atria (<b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> ventricle or absent AV connection) to hearts not amenable to biventricular repair, namely hearts with two ventricles unable to sustain separately pulmonary and systemic circulations in sequence. In the latter definition, even hearts with one hypoplastic ventricle are considered functional univentricular hearts. They include pulmonary or aortic atresia, severe stenosis, and rare conditions like huge intramural cardiac tumors and Ebstein anomaly with extreme atrialization of RV cavity. In this setting, the surgical repair is univentricular with Fontan operation, bypassing the ventricular mass. The cases of anatomically true univentricular hearts (<b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> or absent AV connection) almost invariably show two ventricular chambers, one main and one accessory, which lacks an inlet portion. The latter is located posteriorly when morphologically left and anteriorly when morphologically right. As far as <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> LV, this is usually associated with discordant VA connection (transposition of the great arteries). All the {{blood flow to the}} aorta, which takes origin from the hypoplastic anterior RV, is ventricular septal defect (bulbo-ventricular foramen) dependent. If restrictive, an aortic arch obstruction may be present. <b>Double</b> <b>inlet</b> LV may be associated with VA concordance (Holmes heart). As far as <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> RV with posterior hypoplastic LV cavity, ventriculo- arterial connection is usually of double outlet type. Thus the term double inlet-outlet RV may be coined. In this condition, the contra lateral patent AV valve, may be either mitral or tricuspid in terms of morphology and the underlying ventricle (main chamber) either morphologically left or right. Establishing the loop, whatever right or left (also called right or LV topology), is a fundamental step in the segmental-sequential analysis of congenital heart diseases...|$|E
40|$|Doppler {{echocardiography}} {{was used}} to evaluate blood flow in the pulmonary artery in 14 patients 2 to 42 months (mean (SD) 17 (12) months) after a modified Fontan operation incorporating a direct atriopulmonary anastomosis. Preoperatively six patients had tricuspid atresia, six had a <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> left ventricle, and two had pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum. The postoperative rhythm was sinus in 11 patients, junctional in one, ventricular pacing in one, and atrioventricular sequential pacing in one. In one patient the Doppler trace was unsatisfactory for analysis. In all patients forward flow in the pulmonary artery had biphasic peaks related to both atrial and ventricular contraction. The mean (SD) peak flow velocity that was synchronous with atrial contraction was 80 (30) cm/s and that synchronous with ventricular contraction was 74 (23) cm/s. The atrial contribution to total pulmonary artery flow, assessed by velocity-time integrals, varied between 22 % and 73 % (mean (SD) 45 (14) %). In patients with tricuspid atresia the mean (SD) peak flow velocity with atrial contraction was 90 (27) cm/s and that with ventricular contraction was mean (SD) 68 (24) cm/s. In patients with <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> left ventricle the mean (SD) peak flow velocity was 67 (36) cm/s with atrial contraction and 80 (25) cm/s with ventricular contraction. The atrial contribution to total pulmonary blood flow in patients with tricuspid atresia was significantly higher (53 (11) %) than in those with <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> left ventricle (37 (14) %). Pulmonary artery flow after modified Fontan operation was biphasic and was related to both atrial and ventricular contraction.

40|$|This paper reviews recent {{advances}} in pulse tube cryocoolers and their application for cooling infrared sensors. There are many advantages of pulse tube cryocoolers over Stirling cryocoolers associated with the absence of moving parts in the cold head. Efficiencies have been improved considerably {{in the last few}} years to where they equal or even exceed the efficiencies of Stirling cryocoolers. The use of inertance effects and <b>double</b> <b>inlets</b> to improve the efficiencies will be discussed. Pulse tube cryocoolers are now being used or considered for use in cooling infrared detectors for many space applications. One disadvantage of pulse tube coolers is the difficulty in scaling them down to sizes as small as 0. 15 W at 80 K while maintaining high efficiency. A second disadvantage is the larger diameter cold finger required for the same refrigeration power because of the presence of the pulse tube. These two disadvantages have limited their use so far in cooling infrared sensors for many military tactical applications. Progress in overcoming these disadvantages is discussed...|$|R

For each <b>doubled</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity, the increases of erosion rates per impact are 2 – 14 times. The erosion rate per impact varies with particle diameter with “√” shape through bends, {{which is similar to}} the particle deposition behavior in duct flows. The erosion rate curves per injected particle show the shapes of a 90 -degree anticlockwise rotated “S” and a wide open “V,” respectively, for three larger and smaller inlet velocities. The average erosion rates per injected particle are 1. 4 – 18. 9 times those rates per impact due to huge amounts of impacting, especially for those depositing particles. It is obvious that the erosion rate distribution per impact is similar to a “fingerprint” with five clear stripes and a lower “cloud” along the bend deflection angle for the three largest particles; yet, for other smaller particles, the erosion rate distributions are much like an entire “cloud. ”Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to gain better {{understanding}} of the variable anatomical features of <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> left ventricle hearts without cavopulmonary connection that would potentially facilitate favorable streaming. Thirty-nine post-mortem specimens of <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> left ventricle without cavopulmonary connection were investigated. The focus was on anatomical characteristics that could influence the flow and separation of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood in the ventricles. Elements of interest were the ventriculoarterial connection, the spatial relationship of the ventricles, the position and size of the great arteries, the ventricular septal defect, the presence of relative outflow tract stenosis and the relationship of the inflow and outflow tracts. The most common anatomy was a discordant ventriculoarterial connection with an anatomically left-sided morphologically right ventricle (n = 12, 31 %). When looking at the pulmonary trunk/aorta ratio, 21 (72 %) hearts showed no pulmonary stenosis relative to the aorta. The ventricular septal defect created a relative subpulmonary or subaortic stenosis in 13 (41 %) cases. Sixteen (41 %) hearts had a parallel relationship of the inflow and outflow tracts, facilitating separation of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood streams. On the other end of the spectrum were 10 (25 %) hearts with a perpendicular relationship, which might lead to maximum mixing of the blood streams. The relationship of the inflow and outflow tracts as well as the presence of (sub-) pulmonary stenosis might play a crucial role in the distribution of blood in <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> left ventricle hearts.

40|$|Barrier coasts {{and their}} {{associated}} tidal inlet systems {{are a common}} feature {{in many parts of}} the world. They constitute dynamic environments that are in a continuous stage of adapting to the prevailing tide and wave conditions. Commonly, these coastal areas are densely populated and (partly) as a result there often exists a strong conflict of interests between issues related to coastal safety, economic activities and ecology. To manage these different interests, it is important to gain more understanding of the long-term morphological evolution of tidal inlet systems and their adaptation to natural changes and human intervention. In this thesis the focus is on <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> systems, where two tidal inlets connect a back-barrier basin to an ocean or a coastal sea. To investigate the morphological evolution of <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> systems and their adaptation to internal or external change, the equilibrium configuration and stability properties of the cross-sectional areas of the two tidal inlets are studied in detail. To that extent, a widely used empirical relationship for cross-sectional inlet stability is combined with (i) a lumped-parameter (L-P) model (Chapters 2 and 3) and (ii) a two-dimensional, depth-averaged hydrodynamic (2 DH) model for the water motion (Chapter 4). The Marsdiep-Vlie inlet system in the western Dutch Wadden Sea and the Faro-Armona inlet system in the Portuguese Ria Formosa serve as case studies throughout this thesis. With the assumptions of a cross-sectionally averaged, uniform inlet flow velocity and a uniformly fluctuating basin surface elevation, model results of the L-P model show that stable equilibrium configurations where both inlets are open exist. It is necessary, however, to account for the important processes either explicitly, e. g. including a topographic high in the back-barrier basin as observed in the Wadden Sea (Chapter 2), or parametrically, e. g. allowing for inlet entrance/exit losses for relatively short inlets such as in the Ria Formosa (Chapter 3). By solving the depth-averaged, linear shallow water equations on the f-plane with linearised bottom friction, the 2 DH model explicitly accounts for spatial variations in surface elevation in the ocean, inlets and basin. Model results show that these spatial variations, induced by e. g. basin bottom friction, radiation damping, and Coriolis effects, are crucial to simulate and explain the long-term evolution of <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> systems. This approach further allows the identification of a stabilising and destabilising mechanism associated with the persistence or closure of one (or both) of the inlets in a <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> system and hence with its long-term evolution.

Of the hearts, 32 had atrial {{chambers of}} bilateral right morphology while 11 had atrial chambers with bilateral left atrial characteristics. Among the hearts with right atrial isomerism, there were 13 biventricular hearts, all with ambiguous atrioventricular connection. Eight had a common valve and five had two atrioventricular valves.

40|$|Designing {{propulsion}} systems for both military vehicles and potentially new transport aircraft concepts with highly integrated engine installation requires to handle an increasingly complex flow structure while respecting multiple constraints on feasible inlet geometries by signature and installation needs. Design of these {{propulsion systems}} {{will be even}} more challenging due to the severe interaction of the compressor performance with its distorted inflow conditions. The authors intend to develop tools and optimization strategies, which allows an integrated, optimal design of both the inlet and the low pressure compressor. Based on experience in the field of compressor design and optimization, the current work constitutes a first step towards incorporating the inlet into design and optimization processes.

40|$|Barrier island coasts are {{a common}} feature {{in many parts of}} the world. An example is the Wadden coast of The Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. These coasts consist of barrier islands {{separated}} by tidal inlets with at the landward side tidal basins. Characteristic for the Wadden Sea is that the tidal basins are not completely separated,but are connected via topographic highs allowing exchange of water between the basins. As a result the tidal inlets that connect the basins to the North Sea will interact. The focus in this thesis is on the effect of this interaction on the cross-sectional equilibrium and stability of tidal inlets that are part of a <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> system. The knowledge gained in this study will help to develop rational management plans for this kind of system. In determining the equilibrium values and stability of cross-sectional areas of the inlets use is made of flow diagrams. A flow diagram consists of the equilibrium flow curves of each inlet and a flow field showing the adaptation of the inlet cross-sections after the system has been removed from equilibrium. Each intersection of the equilibrium flow curves represents a stable or unstable equilibrium. The equilibrium flow curve for each inlet is the locus of the values of the cross-sectional areas for which the velocity amplitude in the inlet equals the equilibrium velocity i. e. approximately 1 m/s according to ESCOFFIER [1940]. As a start the <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> system is schematized as a basin connected to the ocean by two channels. The water surface area of the basin is assumed constant and water levels are assumed to fluctuate uniformly. On the seaward side a simple harmonic, semidiurnal tide is used to force the system. Analyzing the <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> system under these conditions by means of the flow diagrams leads to the conclusion that a stable equilibrium of the two inlets does not exist. Ultimately only one inlet remains open and the other will close. This confirms the earlier conclusions of VAN DE KREEKE [1990] and BORSJE [2003] concerning the cross-sectional stability of multiple inlet systems. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|We have {{analysed}} the atrioventricular junction, ventricular mass, and ventriculoarterial junction in 43 hearts with isomeric atrial chambers. Of the hearts, 32 had atrial {{chambers of}} bilateral right morphology while 11 had atrial chambers with bilateral left atrial characteristics. Among the hearts with right atrial isomerism, there were 13 biventricular hearts, all with ambiguous atrioventricular connection. Eight had a common valve and five had two atrioventricular valves. In the other 19 hearts, the atrial chambers {{were connected to}} only one ventricular chamber, 18 having <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> ventricle through a common valve and the other having absence of the left atrioventricular connection. In these univentricular hearts, all possible types of ventricular morphology were found. The ventriculoarterial junction among these hearts with right isomerism showed great variation. In the hearts with left atrial isomerism, nine hearts had two ventricles and two were univentricular. The biventricular hearts all had ambiguous atrioventricular connection, six via a common valve and three via two valves. The two univentricular hearts both had <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> via a common valve, one to a chamber of right ventricular type {{and the other to}} a chamber of left ventricular type. Both had rudimentary chambers of complementary pattern. The ventriculoarterial junction again showed much variation. Statistical analysis showed that pulmonary obstruction and a univentricular heart were both significantly more frequent in association with right compared with left isomerism. Significant differences were also noted in the two groups in terms of ventriculoarterial connections and infundibular morphology...|$|E
40|$|A 25 -year-old {{man with}} a history of {{transposition}} of the great vessels (L-TGA) was admitted for persistent hemoptysis. He had a history of a <b>double</b> <b>inlet</b> left ventricle, pulmonary hypertension and was postoperative for a Fontan procedure completed at age of 2. No anatomical source for the hemoptysis was found. A thoracic CT showed the Fontan anatomy: SVC connected to the pulmonary artery as per the Glenn connection (IVC drained to right pulmonary artery through the Fontan pathway) and a single ventricle and atrium (Figure 1). SVC venography showed the SVC connected to the pulmonary artery (Figure 2). The hemoptysis resolved after started sidenafil and bosentan for pulmonary hypertension...|$|E
40|$|The inlet vortex {{phenomenon}} was experimentally {{investigated in}} a water tunnel, using hydrogen bubble flow visualization techniques. Several inlet ambient flow combinations were studied, including an inlet and ground plane configuration in a known shear {{as well as an}} irrotational flow, and a <b>double</b> (twin) <b>inlet</b> configuration in an irrotational flow. This latter situation created a boundary layer free analogue of the ground plane and enabled investigation of inlet vortex formation in flow essentially free of ambient vorticity. The three dimensional inlet flow field and the vortex formation mechanisms were determined by marking material lines and observing their path and deformation as they are convected from a far upstream location into the inlet. Two basic mechanisms of inlet vortex generation were found. For flows possessing a vertical component of ambient vorticity, the amplification of this vorticity as the vortex lines are stretched and drawn into the inlet results in the formation of an inlet vortex. However, an inlet vortex does not require the presence of ambient vorticity to form. It can also be created in an irrotational flow, with an inlet in crosswind. In this situation, it is accompanied by a variation in circulation along the axial length of the inlet. The ratio of inlet velocity to upstream velocity is an important parameter in determining the generation of an inlet vortex for both mechanisms.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the numerical investigation via Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) {{to study the}} effect of plenum chamber depth on air flow a distribution in a swirling fluidized bed (SFB). A total of 9 simulations were conducted for 3 plenum chamber depths of 175 mm, 350 mm and 525 mm (below the distributor) for 3 different inlets: single, <b>double</b> and triple <b>inlets.</b> Air flow distribution was analyzed based on the tangential velocity distribution ad pressure drop at the distributor outlet. Statistical parameters used in characterizing the air flow distribution were standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis together with system pressure drop. An optimum plenum chamber depth has low statistical values, implying a uniform velocity distribution inside the bed while low pressure drops are necessary to reduce energy loss in the system. The findings yield that plenum chamber with 175 mm depth with via triple inlets suffices both criteria of high uniformity and low pressure drops...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{prototype}} of a circular Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) built in the laboratories of FN SpA Nuove Tecnologie e Servizi Avanzati is analyzed using a tridimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model. The prototype {{is the result of}} FN and Politecnico di Torino activities developed for the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA) within the framework of Ministry of Economic Development, MSE-ENEA. This model considers heat, mass and current transfer as well as chemical and electrochemical reactions. The results show that some inhomogeneous distributions in the reactants, causing non-optimal use of the reactant surfaces. An effective way to improve the distribution in current density consists in tracing tree shaped channels on the surface onto the distribution porous medium. In this paper Y shaped channels are adopted to improve the distribution of gas within the fuel cell and consequently to enhance the performance of the original design of the fuel cell. In addition, the configuration of the outlet of the anodic compartment is also investigated in order to further increase the performance of the fuel cell. The geometrical parameter identifying the topology of distribution channels are chosen accordingly to the constructal theory. The results show that significant improvements can be achieved. Power density is increased of about 6 % when the tree-shaped channel is adopted. If a <b>double</b> anodic <b>inlet</b> is also considered the enhancement in the power density is of about 11 % with respect to the initial configuratio...|$|R
