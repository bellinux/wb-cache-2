50|$|The {{building}} plan is arranged around a central corridor that runs down all wings {{providing access to}} variously sized rooms on either side. The entry (eastern) wing contains laboratories, offices, toilets, and store rooms. The southern wing contains similar spaces and also a dark room and the post-mortem room. This is a large room, its floor set lower than the other rooms with coved concrete skirtings. It has a large doorway to the exterior in-filled with more recent glazing and a timber door, and a steel I-beam on the ceiling above the door. The northern wing again contains laboratories, offices and store rooms, but also a large lecture room with dais and kitchenette, and an equine operating theatre. Another large room, it has concrete floors, coved concrete skirtings, walls tiled to shoulder height, a steel I-beam and <b>hoist</b> <b>trolley</b> fixed to the ceiling above the large doorway to the exterior.|$|E

5000|$|Ammunition on the E. u. B. {{was moved}} {{by means of a}} shot tray {{provided}} with two two-man handles, a yoke above with an eye and wheels so that shells could be moved by hand, rolled or carried by the <b>trolley</b> <b>hoist</b> which runs along the overhead rail. An extensible rail could raised and braced in place to reach shells placed on the ground on in an ammunition car behind the mount. The shot tray could be hooked to the breech to hold the powder and shell in place while they were manually rammed. The gun had to be loaded at zero elevation and thus had to be re-aimed after every shot. The [...] "Peter Adalbert" [...] fired several different shells with weights between 113.5 and 115 kg. It used the German naval system of ammunition, where the base charge was held in a metallic cartridge case and supplemented by another charge in a silk bag which was rammed first.|$|R
5000|$|PaR Systems {{was awarded}} the {{subcontract}} for the Main Crane System (MCS) for the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement. the system consists of two overhead bridge cranes, which support two 50-ton <b>trolley</b> <b>hoists,</b> and a Mobile Tool Platform (MTP). The MTP is suspended from a third trolley using a wire rope tensile truss with three paired winches, giving the platform six degrees of freedom. the MTP {{is equipped with a}} wide variety of tools, including a manipulator arm, that will be needed to dismantle the Sarcaphagus and reactor building so that the radioactive material can be moved to more stable containment. The bridges are 96 m long, and run on a 150 m long runway track with six rails. There are shielded garages along the track to allow tools to be exchanged to and from the bridges for maintenance and different operations.Engineering was done by PaR Systems, and manufactured by PaR Systems and PaR Marine.|$|R
40|$|March 29, 2007 An actual {{engineering}} problem encountered {{during the}} annual 2006 summer Training Cruise at Maine Maritime Academy {{was brought into}} several courses and used {{as a vehicle for}} student learning while simultaneously providing a viable student-designed solution to the problem. During the Training Cruise, a request was made to re-design and machine a new <b>trolley</b> <b>hoist</b> bar to allow for additional clearance for easier access to work on the ship???s engines. A midshipman took the existing hoisting bar, which has a 2 -ton lifting capacity, and machined a replacement that included a significant change to the geometry. This replacement part was not used during cruise. After cruise, preliminary stress analyses showed a significant deficiency in the part and the instructor of the instructor of the Strength of Materials course decided to allow the students in the Fall to analyze and compare the original and replacement bar for load and stresses. The final ???mini-capstone??? project for this course was for student teams to analyze the original and midshipman design, and {{to come up with a}} new, more robust design. Concurrent with this class, students in the Fall Welding class investigated welding concerns with a suggested ???fix??? to the re-design. This hoist bar project is being carried on to the Spring Materials Engineering classes as well. Material samples will be tested to failure and the processing of the steel will be addressed. The Spring Welding class will also be given a revised assignment of the problem including a ???fix??? from the Materials course to see if a different problem format will give better results. Finally, the Spring Computer Applications class for Engineers will model this bar using a CAD program and upload the drawings into a finite element modeling program to check for stresses and deflections. Time permitting, potential re-designs will be computer-modeled as well. Engineering Department, Maine Maritime Academ...|$|R
