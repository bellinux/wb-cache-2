The control of crystal size distribution (CSD) in pharmaceutical crystallization is of primary importance, as downstream processes such as filtration or drying are greatly affected by {{the properties of the}} CSD.

40|$|A synthesis-based {{approach}} {{to the design of}} crystallizers and industrial crystallization processes is introduced in this thesis. An ontology for a task-based design procedure has been developed which breaks the crystallization process into a subset of basic functions (physical tasks) which transform the physical state of matter to a final desired state. These tasks are connected in a network to accomplish the transformation of the feed into the product within quality specifications. This approach can facilitate the creative process of arriving at novel crystallizer configurations, with the aim to reduce cost of resources and capital, and so arrive at process intensification. Experimental investigations into the effect of actuators on process dynamics and subsequent model validation and parameter estimation studies in fed-batch processes is also studied. The study reveals a significant influence of the actuators on the initial start-up and dynamic behavior of the process, especially the effect of the propeller frequency and the <b>fines</b> <b>removal</b> rate. Modelling of growth rate dispersion (using multi-dimensional population balance models) due to strain in secondary nuclei via attrition provides an interesting insight into the broadening of crystal size distribution and the healing of strained crystals. The sustained cyclic behavior observed in DTB crystallizers for the continuous crystallization of ammonium sulphate from water is captured very well using a two-population balance model approach.

40|$|Controlling {{crystal size}} {{distribution}} (CSD) {{is important to}} downstream processing and to product quality. It is well-recognized that selective removal functions {{can be used to}} influence CSD, for example by manufacturing a product with a larger dominant size or narrower distribution. Early work on the use of feedback control to manipulate the residence time distribution functions of fines in a continuous crystallizer demonstrated the utility of such an approach in handling process upsets and cycling that resulted from system instability. These efforts were extended to batch crystallization, although there remained significant difficulty associated with on-line analysis of the size distribution. The development of new technologies, such as Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement (FBRM), provides a methodology for on-line monitoring of a representation of the crystal population in either batch or continuous crystallization systems. The FBRM technology is based on laser light scattering; properly installed, it allows on-line determination of the chord length distribution (CLD), which is statistically related to the CSD and depends on the geometry of the crystal. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to use the FBRM to monitor the evolution of CSD characteristics and to implement a feedback control scheme that provides the flexibility to move the CSD in a preferred direction. Cooling batch crystallizations of paracetamol has been chosen to investigate implementation of the control scheme.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the mechanisms of}} <b>fining</b> (<b>removal</b> of gases from melt) {{and the effect of}} batch composition, oxidation state of the melt and furnace atmosphere on bubble removal processes for commercial glass types, such as float glass and container glass compositions. The mechanisms of the different stages of sulfate chemistry in the batch and sulfate fining process are presented, depending on the level of addition of cokes in the batch. The fining gas release as function of temperature from batch and melt are shown for different soda-lime-silica glass forming raw material batches. In case of coke and sulfate containing batches, sulfur dioxide gas release takes place in steps and at different temperature levels. SO 2 may evolve from the batch blanket (at about 900 Â°C), but also at higher temperatures from the fresh melt starting at about 1050 Â°C up to 1250 Â°C, some SO 2 release can take place up to 1350 Â°C and then for oxidized melts a strong evolution between 1420 and 1500 Â°C. The last stage of SO 2 evolution from the melt is generally accompanied with oxygen gas formation as well. Bubble growth rates during primary fining a float glass melts from experiments and models are compared and the removal of dissolved gases from such melts will be shown. The paper shows that furnace atmosphere may have an important influence on the temperature of fining gas evolution and total fining gas production: water vapor or helium in the atmosphere will reduce fining onset temperature and may significantly increase gas evolution during primary fining...|$|R

This study aims to employ laboratory experiments to examine coal permeability variation induced by coal fines generation and migration during the dewatering stage. One coal sample from Bowen Basin, Australia, was tested under different pressure differences. The evolution of coal permeability {{and the amount of}} produced coal fines were monitored during the experiments. The pressure difference was increased from the initial 0. 8 MPa to 1. 5 MPa through 7 steps to investigate its impact on the characteristics of coal fines and the corresponding permeability change, and to obtain the critical velocities for a range of particle sizes. Every 5 mL effluent was collected and analysed in terms of particle size distribution and volume. The results revealed that for this sample, the sizes of coal fines ranged from 1 μm to 14 μm. Initially the coal permeability dropped dramatically due to excessive coal fines generation, with 74. 1 % reduction for the case of 0. 8 MPa pressure difference, followed by gradual decline with fluctuations. It was observed that the production of large coal fine particles was accompanied by significant permeability fluctuations. This was attributed to the counteraction between formation damage (cleats plugging and coal fines settlement) and coal <b>fines</b> <b>removal</b> from the samples (widened cleats). Although no clear correlation between particle size and pressure difference was observed, the critical particle size was positively related to the flow velocity. The velocity followed parabolic fashion against the pressure difference. For this sample, keeping the differential pressure between 1. 1 - 1. 3 MPa can reduce the permeability damage induced by coal fines.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Pharmaceutical crystallisation operation is often critical because it determines product properties, such as the crystal size distribution (CSD) and polymorphic form, that can influence the subsequent downstream operations and the product therapeutic performance. Driven by the United States Food and Drug Administration s (FDA) Process Analytical Technology (PAT) initiative and the Quality-by-Design (QbD) concept, the development of control approaches, which can improve the manufacturing of products with desired properties, has become of significant interest. This thesis presents the development and application of PAT-based approaches for the monitoring and control of pharmaceutical crystallisation operations that will ensure consistent production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with the desired size and polymorphic form. The approaches utilised Lasentec {{focused beam reflectance measurement}} (FBRM) and attenuated total reflectance ultraviolet (ATR-UV) spectroscopy as the in situ monitoring and control tools. Crystallisations of the APIs that posses multiple polymorphs are both critical and challenging. This was illustrated in this work by the crystallisations of sulfathiazole polymorphs using literature methods. The processes were monitored using FBRM and ATR-UV spectroscopy to define the design range of the process parameters. The defined range {{could be used as a}} recipe to reproduce the same quality of crystals. The obtained crystals were characterised using various techniques (optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry, hot-stage microscopy (HSM), Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffractometry) to assess the success of the crystallisation processes. The combined results of the techniques showed that all methods were able to produce the desired pure polymorphs. As a contribution to the technique of investigating polymorphism, a combined approach of DSC-HSM with image analysis, was introduced. Results show the capability of the approach to provide a unique insight into the polymorphic transformations and thermal behaviour exhibited by the model compound. The novel direct nucleation control (DNC) approach was introduced to control the CSD. The approach utilises information on nucleation, provided by FBRM, in a feedback control strategy that adapts the process variables, so that the desired CSD of product is achieved. It also provides in situ <b>fines</b> <b>removal</b> through the operating policy, rather than having additional equipment and external recycle loops. The approach does not require concentration measurement and has the advantage of being a model-free approach, requiring no information on nucleation or growth kinetics in order to design an operating curve; the system automatically and adaptively detects the boundary of the operating curve. Experimental results, using glycine in water-ethanol mixture as a model system, show the benefits of DNC to produce larger crystals with narrower CSD compared to uncontrolled operations. The capability of seeded cooling crystallization with temperature cycling approach to control crystal size uniformity and polymorphic purity was evaluated. Using sulfathiazole in n-propanol and in water as model systems, the method was found to accelerate the growth and enhance the size uniformity of the crystals, in comparison with runs using a linear temperature profile, by promoting Ostwald ripening. Although the approach is conceptually capable of controlling polymorphic purity of a system, the effect of solvent-mediated nucleation/growth can be more dominant, as shown by the results of the experiments. The insights into this behaviour of sulfathiazole crystals were captured very well by the FBRM. The study also demonstrated the successful use of a simple non-linear function as a calibration model to relate temperature and absorbance data, obtained using the ATR-UV spectroscopy, to solute concentration during the crystallisation process. The effect of temperature cycling, performed during seeded cooling crystallisation, on the surface features of sulfathiazole crystals was investigated using FBRM and ex situ optical microscopy, SEM and atomic force microscopy. It was observed during the initial stage of the process, the heating phases produced crystals with smooth surfaces, whilst the cooling phases promoted growth of features on the surfaces. These changes detected by the FBRM as an increase in the number of coarse counts during heating and a drop during cooling. Laser beam spreading caused by the surface roughness, and signal/chord splitting due to sharp edges are offered as an explanation for the FBRM results. This shows the capability of the FBRM to provide useful information about the changes on the surface of the crystalline products. The information can be used to avoid problems in the downstream operations, or in the final product property due to variations in flowability and friability, which are influenced by the surface property...|$|E

Due to gas quality specifications and protection of installed equipment including subsea pipelines, impurities need to be removed efficiently. Well designed gas treatment processes have been developed, where <b>fine</b> <b>removal</b> of water and acid gas typically are performed by absorption utilizing glycols and alkanolamines. Inhibition of gas hydrates in pipelines is crucial upstream a processing facility, because pipeline blockages have the possibility of causing complete process shutdown. Research towards complete subsea processing is now conducted, where {{the aim is to}} develop new process technology that can enhance and increase the production efficiency of reservoirs already in operation. Hydrate inhibition, acid gas <b>removal</b> and <b>fine</b> <b>removal</b> of water are traditionally performed in three different processing units. Designing a process where these systems can be combined, may give more efficient and compact processing equipment. In this thesis, the main goal was to conduct a simulation of combined H 2 S and water removal from natural gas by absorption in methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and monoethylene glycol (MEG). Simulations were performed in Aspen plus version 8. 6 and the template ElecNRTL_Rate_Based_MDEA_model was used. The aim was to examine the absorption performance predicted by Aspen Plus of the combined process. A vapor liquid validation (VLE) was performed where H 2 S, CO 2, methane (CH 4) and H 2 O solubility in aqueous MDEA and pure MEG were compared to literature data. In total, 500 experimental data points were compared to the solubility curves predicted by Aspen Plus, which gave average absolute deviations ranging from 3. 5 % to 218. 6 % for temperatures from 25 oC to 130 oC. Validation of H 2 S and CO 2 mixtures in a MDEA-MEG-H 2 O solvent with low water content, revealed high partial pressures of the acid gas components compared to literature data. It was found that absorption of H 2 S and CO 2 required use of aqueous MDEA, because of how the chemical reactions were defined in the template. The absorption simulations were performed for three different natural gas compositions, which were defined to be CH 4 saturated with water, having H 2 S and CO 2 contents ranging from 49. 8 ppm and 5. 6 % to 4. 5 % and 8 %, respectively. The absorption performance using a mixed MDEA-MEG solvent in one contactor, where various solvent concentrations were examined, was found to be insufficient with respect to water removal. Absorption of H 2 S and CO 2 in MDEA, and H 2 O in MEG, including regeneration of the solvents were simulated separately. No recommendations for optimal operating conditions were made, due to lack of operational data {{that could be used for}} comparison. However, some operational areas which were considered as energy efficient for the different composition cases, where chosen for further analysis. Molar liquid-gas ratios, for obtaining 4 ppm H 2 S in the sweet gas utilizing a 45 wt% MDEA solvent at 100 bar, ranged from 0. 75 to 1. 7 at these operational areas. Specific reboiler duties ranged from 3. 79 MJ/kg acid gas to 4. 96 MJ/kg acid gas. H 2 S and CO 2 recoveries were up to 99. 3 % and 99. 5 %. Because equilibrium based calculations were defined in the absorber, the amount of absorbed CO 2 were high for all simulations and results revealed less than 1 % CO 2 in the sweet gas for the same cases. For water removal, it was found that MEG concentrations above 99 % should be used depending on the water content and temperature of the wet gas. Conventional regeneration of MEG in a distillation column to this level of purity, resulted in reboiler temperatures above 190 oC, and were found to exceed the recommended limits with respect to thermal degradation, which are around 165 oC...|$|R

Using sulfathiazole in n-propanol and in water as model systems, the method was found to accelerate the growth and enhance the size uniformity of the crystals, in comparison with runs using a linear temperature profile, by promoting Ostwald ripening. Although the approach is conceptually capable of controlling polymorphic purity of a system, the effect of solvent-mediated nucleation/growth can be more dominant, as shown by the results of the experiments. The insights into this behaviour of sulfathiazole crystals were captured very well by the FBRM. The study also demonstrated the successful use of a simple non-linear function as a calibration model to relate temperature and absorbance data, obtained using the ATR-UV spectroscopy, to solute concentration during the crystallisation process. The effect of temperature cycling, performed during seeded cooling crystallisation, on the surface features of sulfathiazole crystals was investigated using FBRM and ex situ optical microscopy, SEM and atomic force microscopy. It was observed during the initial stage of the process, the heating phases produced crystals with smooth surfaces, whilst the cooling phases promoted growth of features on the surfaces. These changes detected by the FBRM as an increase in the number of coarse counts during heating and a drop during cooling. Laser beam spreading caused by the surface roughness, and signal/chord splitting due to sharp edges are offered as an explanation for the FBRM results. This shows the capability of the FBRM to provide useful information about the changes on the surface of the crystalline products. The information can be used to avoid problems in the downstream operations, or in the final product property due to variations in flowability and friability, which are influenced by the surface property.

40|$|Abstract. A novel <b>fine</b> {{inclusion}} <b>removal</b> technology {{due to the}} dispersed in-situ phase {{induced by}} the composite ball explosive reaction was put forward. A composite ball with this function has been designed and prepared using a laboratory model batch type balling disc (at 12 rpm) and the composite ball has been fed {{at the end of}} RH refining. The results indicate that feeding composite ball in RH ladle is a novel technology and the inclusion in the IF molten steel can be removed effectively. Compared with conventional inclusion removal technology, the number of the oxide inclusion can be decreased to a lower level and the inclusion size becomes finer. Using this novel technology, the total oxygen in the as-cast slab can approach to 5 ppm and the steel production cost for per ton can be reduced by 5 ~ 12 RMB...|$|R
40|$|Although pulsed corona {{technology}} for air purification is widely {{investigated by the}} lab experiments, large-scale application {{has yet to be}} proven. Industrial systems require large flow handling and thus, high corona power. An autonomous semi-industrial scale pilot wire-cylinder type corona reactor has been constructed for air purification demonstrations. The reactor is powered by a 10 -kW spark gap-based pulsed power supply, capable of generating 60 -kV 100 -ns wide pulses with 1 -kHz repetition rate. The pulses are optionally superimposed on a 0 – 30 -kV dc bias to enable electrostatic precipitation. The system has been successfully applied during several field and lab experiments. Conversion data as a function of energy density are presented for ${rm NO}_{x}$, ${rm NH}_{ 3 }$, ${rm H}_{ 2 }{rm S}$, toluene, limonene, and <b>fine</b> dust <b>removal.</b> The system proves feasibility of large-scale air purification by pulsed corona...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{numerical}} model for simulating precipitation of submicrometer particles in a single-wire electrostatic precipitator {{is discussed in}} this paper. It includes all essential phenomena affecting the process: electric field, space charge density, gas flow, including the secondary electrohydrodynamic flow caused by the corona discharge and charged particles, and particle transport. A simplified corona model assumes just one ionic species and neglects the ionization zone. The fully coupled model for the secondary EHD flow, considering the ion convection, has been implemented. The dust particles are charged by ionic bombardment and diffusion. The gas flow pattern is significantly modified by the secondary EHD flow, which depends on the particle concentration. As for fine particles the drift velocity is small and particles practically follow the gas streamlines, the particle concentration {{has a very strong}} effect on the precipitation efficiency.

The Prince went to court to request a €50,000 <b>fine</b> and the <b>removal</b> of the photos from the website. The court agreed that the photos must be removed, and imposed a fine of €5,000 to be paid every time photos of children {{of the royal family}} are placed on the site again.

40|$|Entropic Systems, Inc. 's {{enhanced}} particle {{removal process}} is a new technology that is being successfully applied to the cleaning of inertial guidance instrument parts. In this process, the part to be cleaned is contacted, under conditions of shear, with a solution of a high molecular weight fluorocarbon surfactant in an inert perfluorinated liquid. It is then rinsed with a volatile perfluorinated liquid which is easily evaporated. The perfluorinated liquids of interest are nontoxic, nonflammable, and environmentally compatible. They do not contain chlorine or bromine, and thus do not present a hazard to the ozone layer. An order of magnitude increase in the rate and extent of <b>fine</b> particle <b>removal</b> from the surfaces {{of a wide variety}} of instrument parts is observed when CFC- 113 is replaced as the cleaning liquid in an ultrasonic bath by a solution of a high molecular weight fluorocarbon surfactant in an inert perfluorinated liquid.
