HCCI <b>engines</b> can <b>operate</b> on gasoline, diesel fuel and most alternative fuels. The Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) is a promising new engine technology that combines elements of the diesel and gasoline <b>engine</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cycles.</b> Like an SI engine, the charge is well mixed which minimizes particulate emissions, and like a CIDI engine it is compression ignited and has no throttling losses, which leads to high efficiency. However, unlike either of these conventional engines, combustion occurs simultaneously throughout the cylinder volume rather than in a flame front. With the advantages there are some mechanical limitations to the operation of the HCCI engine. The main drawback of HCCI is the absence of direct combustion timing control.

Engine control software development is expensive and time consuming process especially in marine industry. Engine modeling and rapid prototyping are proposed to shorten control system development cycles. Model in the loop simulation can be used to test control system functionality. For this purpose, a zero dimensional mean value engine model is parameterized for a Wärtsilä 6 cylinder medium speed four stroke dual fuel engine. Before parameterization, dual fuel <b>engine</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cycle</b> and combustion process are reviewed in order to model the processes based on physical phenomena. The Combustion Model is the most complex of all the modeled systems. Other systems of the mean value engine model are Engine Model that covers air flow through the engine, Gas System that models fuel gas admission, Fuel System that is in charge of diesel fuel injection, Lube Oil System that simulates heat transfer to lubricating oil and Cooling Water Circuit that handles engine and charge air cooling. These systems are modeled to a varying degree of accuracy. The equations used to model the components of each system are presented. Instrument and start air systems of the engine are not modeled. The engine model is made with Matlab/Simulink. In order to test the control system against the model and ensure their compatibility, control inputs used to influence the plant model and measurement outputs for control system feedback are processed. Test run on the actual engine is made to collect reference data of the engine’s performance. Measured data is used to parameterize the engine model via simulation on development computer. The model is then discretized for real time simulation. During real time simulation on target computer, engine controllers are parameterized to get realistic response. Engine model accuracy is validated by comparing steady-state performance and transient response of the model against measured engine data. Analysis of the results confirms that engine model accuracy is sufficient for control system functionality testing. However, the accuracy is not enough for control system calibration. Due to adequate accuracy, realistic cause and effect relationships between different engine systems and real time simulation capabilities, the engine model can be used for rapid prototyping based control system development...|$|E
40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityEngines convert energy in a resource to work for instance, to propel vehicles in the transportation sector, and drive generators in the electric power sector. In 2004, these two sectors account for nearly 60 % of global energy consumption and the attendant carbon dioxide emissions. Simple-cycle combustion engines dominate the transportation sector due to size and cost advantages, and underpin the operation of many electric power plants. This dissertation establishes the thermodynamic requirements for this class of engines to be efficient, thus providing guidance and direction for future {{research and development of}} high-efficiency energy systems with low greenhouse-gas emissions. The dissertation first considers efficiency maximization for an adiabatic, homogeneous piston engine, formulated as a dynamical system optimal control problem. In thermodynamic terms, the optimal control reduces to a strategy of carrying out combustion at the highest possible internal energy state (i. e., the "extreme state") so as to minimize the corresponding entropy change from reactants to equilibrium products at the same internal energy U and volume V. This optimal strategy remains operative when non-adiabatic, non-homogeneous piston engines are considered. Similar results are obtained for steady-flow systems, by converting the closed system U, V representation of the combustion engine to the open-system H, P representation. In this case, the optimal strategy is to combust at the highest enthalpy state to minimize the reactant-to-product entropy change at constant enthalpy H and pressure P. The extreme state principle is thus shown to govern the optimal operation of both volume-limited (closed-system) and pressure-limited (open-system) simple-cycle combustion engines. The optimal combustion process is also shown to be separable from the reactant preparation step preceding it and the process of work extraction afterwards. These three elements of the optimal <b>engine</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cycle</b> are examined from the exergy management standpoint by analyzing the interplay between exergy destruction due to combustion and exergy flows (via transfers of work, heat and matter) associated with reactant preparation as well as work extraction. When considered on its own, work extraction is optimized when the combustion products expand to the environmental dead state before being discharged at zero exergy level. However, this optimality condition is mismatched to the combustion process. Reactant compression is {{the most effective way to}} alleviate the mismatch, since it reduces the exergy destroyed during combustion (by raising the system energy density, in accordance with the extreme state principle) as well as improves the subsequent gas expansion step (as work investment is entropy-free). Other reactant preparation techniques consideredincluding reactant heating or cooling, and dilution with exhaust or excess airaffect overall cycle work output to a lesser extent as they entail trade-offs between combustion and work extraction. At fixed compression ratio, the potential for engine efficiency improvement via piston motion optimization is shown to be small, estimated at 2 to 3 % relative to the conventional slider-crank motion. The dissertation concludes by considering a generalized piston engine that is controlled by work, heat, and matter transfers, and destroys exergy due to combustion, engine cooling, and blowby. The optimal solution for minimum entropy generation in this generalized engine model still reduces to the strategy of minimizing the entropy change from reactants to products at constant U, V, and atomic composition. However, effecting changes via active control of heat and matter transfers is more challenging compared to work. This disparity is discussed in thermodynamic terms, and its implications for optimal reactive engine design are outlined...|$|E

50|$|Improvements in power, fuel economy, and noise, vibration, and {{harshness}} in both small- and large-capacity turbodiesels {{over the}} last decade have spurred their widespread adoption in certain markets, notably in Europe where they (as of 2014) make up over 50% of new car registrations. Turbodiesels are generally considered more flexible for automotive uses than naturally aspirated diesels, which have strong low-speed torque outputs but lack power at higher speeds. Turbodiesels can be designed to have a more acceptable spread of both power and torque over their speed range or, if being built for commercial use, can be designed to improve either torque or power at a given speed depending on the exact use. Naturally aspirated diesels, almost without exception, have a lower power output than a petrol engine of the same capacity whilst the same time requiring stronger (and thus heavier) internal components such as the pistons and crankshaft to withstand the greater stresses of the diesel <b>engine's</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cycle.</b> These factors give naturally aspirated diesels a poor power-to-weight ratio. Turbocharger units weigh very little but can offer significant power, torque, and efficiency improvements.
