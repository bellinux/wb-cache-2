A ditch and outlet drainage structure made of concrete at Wardens Place drains into the lake; its purpose is to control small-scale local road flooding.|$|E

For example, a ball on the side line {{is still in the}} field of play; a ball on the line of the penalty circle is in the penalty circle; a foul committed over the 23-metre (25-yard) line <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 23-metre area. A ball must completely cross a boundary line to be out of play, and a ball must wholly cross the goal line before a goal is scored.|$|E
5|$|In Europe and the Americas, a {{relatively}} small number of DPB cases have been reported in Asian immigrants and residents, as well as in individuals of non-Asian ancestry. Misdiagnosis <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West owing to less recognition of the disease than in Asian countries. Relative to the large number of Asians living in the west, the small number of them thought to be affected by DPB suggests non-genetic factors may play some role in its cause. This rarity seen in Western Asians may also be partly associated with misdiagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Results from a {{histological}} {{analysis performed}} on a rib from specimen FMNH PR 3847 were reported by McDonald and colleagues in 2017. Extensive bone remodeling <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> internal matrix of the rib. The medullary cavity, which houses the marrow, is marked {{by the presence of}} many cavities, or lacunae. On the outer surface of the bone, osteons have almost completely replaced the interior of the bone; the layered growth of the bone is more visible on the interior of the bone, where five lines of arrested growth (LAGs) are visible. A sixth LAG is possibly present within the medullary region, but is relatively limited in extent, which makes this identification questionable.|$|E

5|$|Genetic testing results {{published}} in 2001 indicated that Namib Desert Horses {{are one of}} the most isolated horse populations in the world, with the second-lowest genetic variation of all horse populations that have been studied to date. In part, this is due to their small founding population, and generally small modern population, made smaller during periods of drought. Despite the large domesticated breeding population from which the horses originally descended, at least one genetic bottleneck <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> breed's history, resulting in a significant decline in genetic variation over a relatively short period of time. Although an ideal minimum population size for genetic variability would be around 200 horses, the current range cannot support this population given the average rainfall. Estimates for a necessary minimum population to maintain genetic effectiveness range between 100 and 150 animals.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the station}} started construction, land {{prices in the}} {{immediate}} area have nearly doubled. Interest in the surrounding area has also grown, as many development {{companies are going to}} Hudson Yards to buy air rights; for instance Related Companies, already the developer of Hudson Yards, entered a contract to buy a $75 million-plus parcel of land between 35th and 36th Streets and between Eleventh Avenue and Hudson Boulevard, as well as land over a McDonald's to build 50 Hudson Yards. Also {{as a result of the}} subway extension, three tenants have already been found for 10 Hudson Yards, and Citigroup is considering moving to the area. Most importantly, however, the $750 million platform supporting much of Hudson Yards was built starting in January 2013; subway construction for a station that could potentially carry up to 27,000 daily passengers necessitated the construction of more buildings, as 70% of tenants are expected to come to Hudson Yards via the 7 subway extension. Additionally, new restaurants, luxury condominiums, and stores have appeared near the station and along the extension's route, and residential prices along the extension have also increased. A construction boom <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> greater Hudson Yards area as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{songs of}} {{mainland}} goldcrests vary only slightly across their range and {{consist of a}} single song type, but much more divergence <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> isolated Macaronesian populations. Not only are there variations between islands and within an island, but individual males on the Azores can have up to three song types. The dialects on the Azores fall into two main groups, neither of which elicited a response from male European goldcrests in playback experiments. There are also two main dialect groups on the Canary islands, a widespread group similar to the European version, and another that is restricted to the mountains of Tenerife. The song variations {{have been used to}} investigate the colonisation pattern of the Macaronesian islands by goldcrests, and identified a previously unknown subspecies.|$|E

5|$|Hibbard {{wrote that}} the {{condition}} of the mental foramen and masseteric ridges excluded the specimen from Onychomys, Peromyscus, Reithrodontomys, and Eligmodontia and that in these features and in its depth and size, the fossil more closely resembled Oryzomys; therefore, he placed it in that genus with a query. Oryzomys is a living genus that <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States since at least 300,000 years ago. In 1966, Philip Hershkovitz wrote that Hibbard had reconsidered his opinion after re-examining ? O.pliocaenicus in 1952; he no longer thought that it was an Oryzomys and instead believed it may be a Bensonomys. The latter genus occurs in the late Miocene and early Pliocene of North America and has been variously interpreted as a close relative of the South American Calomys or merely as an evolutionarily convergent member of the North American subfamily Neotominae. Jon Baskin mentioned the animal in 1978 and 1986, asserting that it cannot be identified to genus level, but may be Bensonomys. Although some continue to list it under Oryzomys, it is now usually excluded from the genus. In 2008, Everett Lindsay listed ? O.pliocaenicus as a questionable species of Jacobsomys, a Pliocene North American genus which he said may be ancestral to Oryzomys.|$|E
