5000|$|In episode 4 {{it really}} becomes evident that Randall has a {{distinct}} hatred of the police, which is reciprocated. In nearly every episode where the police are involved with enquiries some {{way or the other}} they always suspect Randall as the villain in a crime with Randall many a time treating them rather rudely in his frustration. In many episodes he conflicts with the suspicious Inspector Large played by Ivor Dean. In the eighth episode [...] "Whoever Heard of a Ghost Dying?" [...] and the 10th episode [...] "When <b>did</b> <b>You</b> <b>Start</b> to Stop Seeing Things?" [...] in particular, Randall is suspected of not only being a criminal involved in the operation of diamond operations but is suspected as a murderer, implicated to directly throw the police off guard.|$|E
5000|$|The comedic {{aspect of}} the series came to the surface in episode 2, [...] "A Disturbing Case", which dealt with {{hypnotic}} suggestion. Written by star Mike Pratt, the episode features Marty impersonating the thick German accent of the German psychiatrist Dr Conrad (David Bauer), allowing him to direct the glazed, drugged Randall {{to do exactly what}} he wants whilst he is in his pyjamas in a nursing home. Although the second episode is undoubtedly the most comic of the series, Marty's ability to control hypnosis is an important source of comedy in subsequent episodes, notably episode 10, [...] "When <b>did</b> <b>You</b> <b>Start</b> to Stop Seeing Things?", in which he hypnotizes a hypnotist to save Randall, directing him to behave like an animal and act like a Secret Agent contrary to expected professional behaviour.|$|E

5000|$|The album {{received}} generally favourable reviews with Metacritic {{giving it}} a score of 80% from 7 reviews. AllMusic awarded the album 3½ stars and in its review by Matt Collar, states [...] "Ultimately, Where <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Start</b> is an intimate, impressionistic, and probing release that should certainly appeal to longtime fans of Mehldau's nuanced jazz style". The Guardian's John Fordham observed [...] "the dynamics and empathy of this ensemble remain pretty irresistible". On All About Jazz, John Kelman noted [...] "Where <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Start</b> isn't so much an alternative as it is further evidence—as if any were needed—of this tremendous trio's ability to take any material—old, new, borrowed or original—and make it firmly its own". BBC Music reviewer, Martin Longley commented [...] "Where <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Start</b> revives the old Mehldau approach of covering songs from across the decades... Yet Mehldau’s method is so dominant that everything gravitates towards the trio’s signature sound, lending cohesion to a variegated crop... It all points to Mehldau entering a new prime phase in his career, both onstage and in the recording studio".|$|R

30|$|Other two {{questions}} of relevance are: Question 3 b “At what age {{do you intend}} to leave the labour force?” and Question 7 b “At what age <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> collecting a retirement pension?” Question 3 b is addressed to individuals who are still in the labour force, in this case employed older individuals, while Question 7 b is directed both at people who might already be retired and at employed individuals. The mean intended age of retirement is 64  years old and 59 is the mean and median age of start of pension collection. Conditional on being in the labour force, employed individuals report a higher “expected” age of retirement when compared to the average age of retirement of retirees (64 versus 59  years old, respectively). Considering that in 2005 (see Additional file 1 : Appendix A in the web appendix) a legal diploma suspended all early retirement schemes, making the collection of pension benefits only possible at age 65 or over, retirement expectations of active individuals are surely influenced.|$|E
40|$|So how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> {{your day}} today? Did {{you take a}} too quick shower {{followed}} by {{something that looked like}} break-fast and a few quiet minutes reading the newspaper? Or maybe it was the back of the cereal box you read … or the latest issue of Sports Illustrated … or the juicy pulp novel that you are too embarrassed to tell anyone about? Whatever it was, odds are that you spent some of your leisure time reading something. The unconscious choice to engage in lit-erate behavior is learned. According to Rubin (1986) : Literacy is not a quality that one possesses or doesn’t possess. It is not like red hair and freckles, permanently distinguishing some people. Nor is reading like having a healthy heart muscle that one builds up and maintains through practice. Rather, reading is something that one does. Literacy, like-wise, is a way of coming in contact with the world. Some people engage in literate behavior with greater frequency and intensity than others. Some people use literate behavior to expand their worlds across time and space. Some people read traffic signs and cereal boxes. (p. 81...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{provides}} an overview of the Translation Quality Index (TQI), a measurement methodology that {{can be used as a}} reliable indicator of translation quality.

TRANSLATION QUALITY MEASUREMENT 1. 1 How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> working on translation quality measurement? We have known each other for years—we both graduated in translation from the same university and currently live in the same area—but we had never worked together. In 2000, we were both giving presentations at the ATA Conference in Orlando, Florida. We started to talk about how people generally assumed that translation quality could not be measured. One thing led to another, and we decided to see if we could find a way to measure the quality of translation as a basis for process improvement. In the following three years, we developed our research and gave three presentations on how to measure and control translation quality. At the same time, we applied our work at the companies for which we worked: Lionbridge in Franco’s case and J. D. Edwards in Riccardo’s...|$|E
