6000|$|Your {{book is not}} yet to hand, {{but will}} {{probably}} follow next month. [...] <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> <b>you</b> early in the BOOKMAN, which I usually see, and noted you in particular as displaying a monstrous ingratitude about the footnote. Well, mankind is ungrateful; 'Man's ingratitude to man makes countless thousands mourn,' quo' Rab - or words to that effect. By the way, an anecdote of a cautious sailor: 'Bill, Bill,' says I to him, 'OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Grounds! {{you shall}} have them; {{and turn to}} the light that I may see your brazen face blush black, when you hear {{yourself}} {{proved to be a}} liar and a hypocrite. At a public meeting in the Town-hall yesterday, I had the pleasure of hearing myself insulted by the speaker opposed to me in the question under discussion, by allusions to my private affairs; by cant about monsters without natural affection, family despots, and such trash; and when I rose to answer, I was met by a shout from the filthy mob, where the mention of your name enabled me at once to detect the quarter in which this base attack had originated. When I looked round, I saw that treacherous villain, Hunsden acting as fugleman. <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> <b>you</b> in close conversation with Hunsden at my house a month ago, and I know that you were at Hunsden's rooms last night. Deny it if you dare." ...|$|R
6000|$|But the visitant {{raised his}} finger. 'For six-and-thirty years {{that you have}} been in this world,' said be, 'through many changes of fortune and {{varieties}} of humour, I have watched you steadily fall. Fifteen years ago you would have started at a theft. Three years back you would have blenched at the name of murder. Is there any crime, is there any cruelty or meanness, from which you still recoil?--five years from now <b>I</b> shall <b>detect</b> <b>you</b> in the fact! Downward, downward, lies your way; nor can anything but death avail to stop you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you forgive}} me, Mr. Tyrrel," [...] she said, [...] "if I say I have been {{watching}} your thoughts for some moments, and that <b>I</b> have <b>detected</b> <b>you?</b> All the while that I have been talking of these good folks, {{and that you have}} been making such civil replies, that they might be with great propriety and utility inserted in the 'Familiar Dialogues, teaching foreigners how to express themselves in English upon ordinary occasions'--your mind has been entirely fixed upon that empty chair, which hath remained there opposite betwixt our worthy president and Sir Bingo Binks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I do, and {{you must}} {{take my word for}} it. Well! If you could endure to have such a {{worthless}} fellow, and a fellow of such indifferent reputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might be permitted to come and go as a privileged person here; that I might be regarded as an useless (and I would add, {{if it were not for}} the resemblance <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> between <b>you</b> and me, an unornamental) piece of furniture, tolerated for its old service, and taken no notice of. I doubt if I should abuse the permission. It is a hundred to one if I should avail myself of it four times in a year. It would satisfy me, I dare say, to know that I had it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tut, tut, Mr. Mac!--the {{first sign}} of temper <b>I</b> have <b>detected</b> in <b>you.</b> Well, <b>I</b> won't read it verbatim, since you feel so {{strongly}} upon the subject. But when I {{tell you that there}} is some account of the taking of the place by a parliamentary colonel in 1644, of the concealment of Charles for several days {{in the course of the}} Civil War, and finally of a visit there by the second George, you will admit that there are various associations of interest connected with this ancient house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is but one}} man in the American army {{who could}} <b>detect</b> <b>you,</b> Captain Wharton," [...] said the peddler, {{surveying}} his work with satisfaction, [...] "and he is just now out of our way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} you would be able to {{maintain}} the character? Because you must remember that if <b>detected</b> <b>you</b> might be torn in pieces by the slaves, before the officers could interfere to protect you." ...|$|R
60|$|I bowed, yet not so low {{but that}} <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> a sneer on Yvonne's lips.|$|R
60|$|In that position, he {{not only}} <b>{{detected}}</b> <b>you</b> in taking the Diamond out of the drawer--he also detected Miss Verinder, silently watching you from her bedroom, through her open door. His own eyes satisfied him that SHE saw you take the Diamond, too.|$|R
60|$|Nobody spoke, but <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> in {{one quarter}} {{that this was}} really the case.|$|R
60|$|I {{smiled back}} at them, and {{in the eyes of}} more than one <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> a look of commiseration.|$|R
6000|$|... "Philosopher! I am astounded at your effrontery. <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> your {{philosophy}} {{the very}} first maxim. Who posted that parchment for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! She was {{dismissed}} on his account. And <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> him in imposing on Miss Morton. Yet--where does this Mrs. Hall live?' ...|$|R
60|$|Amicia. Do {{you ever}} hear the {{occupants}} of the stalls talking? Never, in the entr'actes, have <b>I</b> <b>detected,</b> on their lips, a criticism or a comment.|$|R
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 2: How to <b>detect</b> if <b>you</b> are {{infected}} with Fireball ...|$|R
60|$|In my turn, I stepped back. But {{in making}} the action, <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> in his eyes some latent fear of me. This put the monstrous thought to flight.|$|R
6000|$|Medhurst nodded. [...] "Why, certainly," [...] he said; and, for {{the first}} time, <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> a {{lingering}} trace of American accent. [...] "It's my business to know about him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I follow," [...] said Quentin, {{drawing his}} sword, [...] "but {{the moment in}} which <b>I</b> <b>detect</b> the least sign of treachery, thy head and body are three yards separate!" ...|$|R
40|$|Story:    Many {{other towns}} have {{drastically}} been invaded {{and turned into}} ghost towns; {{no one knows what}} has been happening to the towns. As one town remains in the outskirts of the wild wide west they try to defend their town against the evil that is coming so that their town doesn�t become the next Ghost Town!   Objective:    The objective of the game is that you are the bad guy in the game and your mission is to try and kill everyone in the town without being <b>detected.</b> Once <b>you</b> are <b>detected</b> <b>you</b> will have trouble killing everyone because unlike you the cowboys have guns...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> in her tone-although {{it was not}} apologetic--a {{desire to}} spare my feelings. She hesitated a moment more, and then left the room, closing the door softly behind her...|$|R
60|$|I {{watched her}} face {{carefully}} as I spoke, and I thought that <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> a very faint flush mounting her cheek. Seeing an opening and an advantage, I sought {{to follow it}} up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if {{you don't}} mind, I will take Lindsay, Holmes, and Tritton into my confidence. They all play occasionally, {{and you must}} let me mention that you are {{altogether}} in his power; and that, unless he is <b>detected,</b> <b>you</b> will {{have to leave the}} regiment. Mind, don't you watch him yourself. Play even more recklessly than usual; that will make him a bit careless." ...|$|R
60|$|The tone {{in which}} he retorted, and a certain disturbance, after he had spoken, which <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> in his manner, {{suggested}} {{to me that he}} was possessed of some information which he hesitated to communicate.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do," [...] {{returned}} the Chemist. [...] "You know what I would ask. Why has this child alone been proof against my influence, and why, why, have <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> in its thoughts a terrible companionship with mine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] said he with a {{momentary}} hesitation, [...] "you know I'm dying {{to hear of}} how you came to be alone in that boat. Damn that howling!" [...] <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> a certain suspicion in his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, hello, Gertie! What {{seems to}} be the matter? Don't <b>I</b> <b>detect</b> a chill in the atmosphere? So sorry you've gone and gotten refined on me. I was just going to suggest some low-brow {{amusement}} like tea at the Casino." ...|$|R
60|$|From the {{glimpse of}} a play-bill, which <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> peeping out of his pocket, I {{inferred}} that he patronized the theaters; and from the flush of his cheeks, that he patronized the fine old Port wine, for which Liverpool is famous.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are very}} confiding, Mademoiselle, for <b>I</b> <b>detect</b> treachery in every face around us. Even Miss Van Cortlandt has {{the air of}} a conspirator, and seems to be in league with {{something}} or somebody. Pray Heaven, it be not with wolves." ...|$|R
30|$|Inspect {{the segment}} {{beginning}} with current sample <b>i.</b> <b>Detect</b> the synchronization code using the technique developed in Section  4. If the synchronization code is present, go to step 3; otherwise, move one sample forward (i[*]←[*]i[*]+[*] 1) and repeat step 2.|$|R
60|$|It went well. No {{question}} about that. For the first time, a smile lit up Aunt Dahlia's drawn face. Uncle Tom grunted approvingly. Anatole {{said something in}} Provençal that sounded complimentary. And <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> even on Angela's map a slight softening.|$|R
60|$|I {{pass over}} the fact that being interviewed for five hours is a {{fatiguing}} process. I lay no claim to exemption for that. But to that no doubt was due the singular discrepancies as to my physical appearance which <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> in the London papers.|$|R
60|$|Thou shalt make thy house The {{temple of}} a nation's vows. Spirits {{of a higher}} strain Who sought thee once shall seek again. <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> many a god Forth already on the road, Ancestors of beauty come In thy breast to make a home.|$|R
6000|$|... "Has any woman--now {{this is not}} retaliation, my dear Jim, for <b>I</b> fancy <b>I</b> <b>detect</b> a woman's cleverness and a woman's stupidity in this forgery--any {{access to}} your secrets or my letters? A woman's villainy is always {{effective}} for the moment, but always defective when probed." ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{answered}} at last: I had discovered all. Margaret!--I {{had heard her}} name, too. Margaret!--it had never hitherto been a favourite name with me. Now I felt a sort of terror as <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> myself repeating it, and finding a new, unimagined poetry in the sound.|$|R
6000|$|... "The same. Thou knowest Annina, old Tomaso's daughter; for {{she danced}} in the very set in which <b>I</b> <b>detected</b> thy countenance! <b>I</b> would not speak thus of the girl, but that I know thou art not {{backward}} to receive liquors that do not visit the custom-house, thyself." ...|$|R
