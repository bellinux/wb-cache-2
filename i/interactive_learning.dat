40|$|Earlier {{research}} has shown that combining education with entertainment can improve students motivation in school. With this study we aim to <b>learn</b> more about <b>interactive</b> digital <b>learning</b> resources and how they should be designed to entertain and thereby contribute to motivation. We have identified aspects of educational games that also could be considered when developing <b>interactive</b> digital <b>learning</b> resources, to make them more entertaining and motivating. We have chosen to study and evaluate an <b>interactive</b> digital <b>learning</b> resource called “Grasp the Disaster”, a fictional online adventure created for students in the ages between 13 - 15. By studying the guidelines for educational games and then customize them for <b>interactive</b> digital <b>learning</b> resources, we found that “Grasp the Disaster” is a well produced <b>interactive</b> digital <b>learning</b> resource, though in need of a few changes. In addition to evaluating the production itself, we could also confirm that the guidelines we have customized can actually be applied to an <b>interactive</b> digital <b>learning</b> resource when it comes to design and evaluation. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 End-user <b>interactive</b> machine <b>learning</b> is a {{promising}} tool for enhancing human capabilities with data. Recent work {{has shown that}} we can create specific applications that employ end-user <b>interactive</b> machine <b>learning.</b> However, we still lack a generalized {{understanding of how to}} design effective end-user interaction with machine learning. This dissertation advances our understanding of this problem by demonstrating effective end-user interaction with machine learning in a variety of new situations and by characterizing the design factors affecting the end-user <b>interactive</b> machine <b>learning</b> process itself. Specifically, this dissertation presents (1) new interaction techniques for end-user creation of image classifiers in an existing end-user <b>interactive</b> machine <b>learning</b> system called CueFlik, (2) a novel system called ReGroup that employs end-user <b>interactive</b> machine <b>learning</b> for the purpose of access control in social networks, (3) a novel system called CueT that supports end-user driven machine learning for computer network alarm triage, and (4) a novel design space characterizing the goals and constraints impacting the end-user <b>interactive</b> machine <b>learning</b> process itself. Together, these contributions can move us beyond ad-hoc designs for specific applications and provide a foundation for future researchers and developers of end-user <b>interactive</b> machine <b>learning</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|In this {{position}} paper, we analyze ways {{that a human}} can best be involved in <b>interactive</b> artificial <b>learning</b> {{against a backdrop of}} traditional AI programming and conventional artificial learning. Our primary claim is that <b>interactive</b> artificial <b>learning</b> can produce a higher return on human investment than conventional methods, meaning that performance of the agent exceeds performance of traditional agents at a lower cost to the human. This claim is clarified by identifying metrics that govern the effectiveness of <b>interactive</b> artificial <b>learning.</b> We then present a roadmap for achieving this claim, identifying ways in which <b>interactive</b> artificial <b>learning</b> can be used to improve each stage of training an artificial agent: configuring, planning, acting, observing, and updating. We conclude by presenting a case study that contrasts programming using conventional artificial learning to programming using <b>interactive</b> artificial <b>learning...</b>|$|R

Unlike computer games, Second Life {{does not have a}} pre-defined purpose and allows for highly realistic enactment of real life activities online. One such study tested the usefuleness of SL as an action learning environment in a senior course for management information systems students. Another presented a case study in which university students were tasked with building an <b>interactive</b> <b>learning</b> experience using SL as a platform. Both problem-based learning and constructionism acted as framing pedagogies for the task, with students working in teams to design and build a learning experience which could be possible in real life.|$|E

The green centre has been planned in the erstwhile fisheries building near Ramakrishna Mutt Road. An audio visual room, environmental education centre, library to document creek activities, laboratory to check water quality, a souvenir shop, coffee corner, all {{form part of}} the centre. The CRRT had to excavate 150,000 tonnes of construction debris and garbage from the site to create a water body embellished with earthen pathways, wooden bridges, signage and bamboo pavilions. A total of 266,000 cubic metres of earth {{was removed from the}} site to create a park. The Phase I of the park has 136,560 plants of 172 indigenous species with about 1,000 name boards with inscriptions of the botanical names. It also includes solar-powered lights, seven water tanks, PVC pipes for a length of 3,100 m, and roads and pathways stretching 4km on the 58-acre campus. The environmental clearance for the Adyar Poonga was obtained from the Union ministry of environment and forests in mid-January 2011. The park was opened to public on 22 January 2011. One fourth of the 58-acre park would be the conservation zone to which public would have no access. A ticket plaza has been built near Brodies Castle Road.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of learning innovation particularly in Civic Education by using element of technology {{through the development}} of <b>interactive</b> multimedia <b>learning</b> media, is one of appropriate strategy to enhance students’ interest and learning outcome. By this <b>interactive</b> multimedia <b>learning</b> media, it is hoped that Civic Education subject is become powerful and meaningful subject for students. This research and development is back grounded by students’ learning outcome and interest which is low in Civic Education subject in SMP Pasundan 1 Bandung. This is because teacher and student interaction take advantage less learning media. The aim of this study is generate <b>interactive</b> multimedia <b>learning</b> media to be able to enhance students’ interest and learning outcome in Civic Education lesson of class VII in SMP Pasundan 1 Bandung. To achieve that aim, researcher use research and development (R&D) approach, Borg and Gall. In particular, the aim of this study are: (1) describe Civic Education learning condition in SMP Pasundan 1 Bandung, (2) obtain the description how to develop <b>interactive</b> multimedia <b>learning</b> media conceptually, (3) obtain the description how to implement <b>interactive</b> multimedia <b>learning</b> media conceptually, (4) find out whether there is enhancement of students’ learning interest in Civic Education lesson after the use of <b>interactive</b> multimedia <b>learning</b> media. Result of study show that (1) Civic Education learning in SMP Pasundan 1 Bandung is conservative because teacher still use media of learning which is less varied, (2) development stages of <b>interactive</b> multimedia <b>learning</b> media are needed which consist of pre production, production and post production stages, (3) teacher and student’s computer basic ability in using <b>interactive</b> multimedia <b>learning</b> and <b>interactive</b> multimedia <b>learning</b> media can be used organized with computer laboratory, classically in class, or can be used by students out of school by needing some facility or equipment such as computer and the like, LCD Projector, and some another supporting equipment, (4) there is significant difference between pretest and posttest result in students’ learning interest after using <b>interactive</b> multimedia <b>learning</b> media, (5) there is significant difference between pretest and posttest result in students’ Civic Education learning outcome after using <b>interactive</b> multimedia <b>learning</b> media.
