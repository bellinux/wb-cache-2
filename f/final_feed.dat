The SEM results revealed that the initial raw mixture was characterized by long fibers. However, the <b>final</b> <b>feed</b> mixtures were more porous and fragmented. The study indicated that the earthworms digested and fragmented rice straw leading to more surface area in the final vermicompost. Kumar et al.

To avoid the cold iron in casting process, this paper presents a new technology for 50 - 60017 - 00 type pulley. Simulated results, obtained from commercial software "MAGMA", indicate that liquid metal fills the sand smoothly, and no porosity is found in the casting.

30|$|With {{respect to}} sodium and {{chloride}} ion concentration, the <b>final</b> <b>feed</b> solutions showed a lower value than its initial salt sample solution for both ion concentrations {{in case of}} {{the two types of}} IEM systems. This clearly confirmed the migration of ions under the electric field from FC to neighboring compartment. The increase in final Na+ and Cl− ion concentrations with an increase in feed concentration was mainly because of two reasons. First was due to the increased NaCl concentrations in the feed solutions. The second reason was due to the restricted transport of sodium ion and chloride ion through IEMs because of decreased membrane capacity, which was due to the adhesion of the salt ions over the surface of the membrane which in turn was mainly because of the longer duration of previous performances. The higher the difference between the initial and final value effective was the process in the removal of NaCl and higher acid–base concentration with higher purity.|$|E

Final body weight, hot carcass yield, abdominal fat pad and metabolic variables in the blood serum except for aspartate aminotranspherase (AST) level which was significantly lower on 35 th day (p< 0. 01), were not affected by the acidifier. Higher weight gain in the treated group due to better feed efficiency was observed in the first phase. Higher feed intake in the third phase of the trial caused higher <b>final</b> <b>feed</b> conversion ratio (p< 0. 01).

40|$|Aim: The {{effect of}} a {{specific}} combination (SC) of carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, and Capsicum oleoresin was investigated on productive performance and immune response in broiler chickens. Materials and Methods: Six hundred one-day-old broiler chickens were randomly allocated into two groups for 5 weeks. The SC was supplemented at 100 ppm of ration (presence or absence). Results: Treatment of broiler chickens with the SC improved productive performance variables {{as compared with the}} blank control birds. It decreased total mortality, increased final body weight, weight gain, production number and decreased <b>final</b> <b>feed</b> conversion ratio (FCR) (P< 0. 05). The SC had a positive effect on carcass quality and enhanced HI titer against Newcastle disease (ND) virus vaccine, as compared to their untreated control group (P< 0. 05). The SC treated birds had higher values of intestinal diameter than the control ones. Conclusion: It could be concluded that administration of a specific combination of carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, and Capsicum oleoresin to broiler chickens improved chicken zootechnical performance response variables, had a potent immuno-modulatory effect (potentiated immune response) and improved gut integrity.

Ali et al. (2012) used TG analysis to study compost maturity in vegetable waste, tree leaves, saw dust and cow dung mixtures using rotary drum composting process. The results revealed that the weight loss at two different temperatures in feed mixtures of summer and spring season were 5 – 10 % higher than that of winter season. The authors confirmed that the spring and summer season composting gave higher decomposition and maturity of organic wastes than the winter season. Ravindran et al.

In addition, an influence on white blood cell counts was noted whereby granulocytes and monocytes were affected in fish treated with the medium and high dose ZEN diet. In muscle samples, marginal ZEN and α-zearalenol (α-ZEL) concentrations were detected. Furthermore, the genotoxic potential of ZEN was confirmed by analysing formation of micronuclei in erythrocytes. In contrast to previous reports on other fish species, estrogenic effects measured as vitellogenin concentrations in serum samples were not increased by dietary exposure to ZEN.

After vermicomposting, the infrared spectra of <b>final</b> <b>feed</b> mixtures showed reductions in 3100 – 3600, 2921 and 2852  cm− 1 region and could be due to the mineralization of carbohydrates and aliphatic compounds. The results revealed that the E. eugeniae in vermicomposting of decanter cake helped in the stabilization and mineralization process. Das et al. (2016) applied FT-IR technique to confirm stability of toxic jute mill waste amended with cow dung and vegetable waste employing earthworm species, Metaphire posthuma. FTIR spectroscopy analysis results observed a higher maturity and stability of vermicomposted jute mill waste as compared to the traditional (without earthworm) product. The presence of aliphatic C–H stretching, stretching vibration of –OH and HOH bonds, and C–C stretching were highly compatible in the vermicomposted samples of jute mill waste. This indicates the waste degradation and mineralization through vermicomposting process. So, FT-IR spectroscopy is an essential instrument to analyze the quality or maturity of end product after vermicomposting in order to use it as perfect manure.|$|E

For the second experiment, broilers were taken off feed on d 49, weighed, and allotted to either normal drinking water or offered a Trp-saturated solution containing 5 g of Trp per 1, 000 mL of water for 4 h in pens during feed withdrawal until cooping for 14 h prior to processing. In the third experiment, a withdrawal feed was formulated with standard or high dietary Trp (2 × requirement, 0. 33 vs. 0. 18 %) and fed to broilers from 46 to 49 d of age.

The interactions of legume species, drying method and stage of growth influenced the crude protein content and nitrogen degradation of the legumes. Siratro maintained a greater protein content ranging from 191 to 282 g/kg DM, at all stages of growth and drying methods than either cassia or lablab which had values ranging from, respectively, 173 to 246 and 162 to 254 g/kg DM, but were also different. Drying the forages at 60 0 C caused an increase in the acid detergent insoluble nitrogen content of the legumes. The neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre and lignin content of cassia and siratro harvested at 8 or 14 weeks of growth were greater than in lablab. While the protein content declines with fibre increasing with advancing plant maturity, the legumes tend to maintain a high CP content, which makes them acceptable protein supplementary feeds to low quality roughages. Among the three legumes, siratro showed a higher sustained CP content followed by cassia, and lablab was the least.

40|$|With any {{reflecting}} or refracting structure, {{such as a}} {{parabolic reflector}} or lens antenna, {{the knowledge of the}} focal point is critical in the design as it determines the point at which a feeding signal should originate for proper operation. Spherically symmetrical lenses have a distinct advantage over other structure types in that there exists an infinite number of focal points surrounding the lens. Due to this feature, a spherical lens can remain in a fixed position while a beam can be steered to any direction by movement of the feed only. Unlike phased arrays that beam-steer electronically, a spherical lens exhibits no beam deterioration at wide angles. The lens that accomplishes this is in practice called the Luneburg lens which has been studied since the 1940 s. Due to the electromechanical properties of the horn antenna, it is often used to feed the above mentioned configurations. In the focusing of any feed antenna, its phase center is an approximate point in space that should be coincident with a reflector or lens’s focal point to minimize phase error over the radiating aperture. Although this is often easily accomplished over a narrow bandwidth, over wide bandwidths some antennas have phase centers that vary significantly, making their focusing a challenge. This thesis seeks to explain the problem with focusing a Luneburg lens with a canonical horn antenna and offers a modified horn design that remains nearly focused over a frequency band of 18 – 45 GHz. In addition to simulating the feed / lens configurations, the lens and feed horn will be fabricated and mounted for far field measurements to be taken in an anechoic antenna range. A <b>final</b> <b>feed</b> design will be implemented in an array configuration with the Luneburg lens, capable of transmitting and receiving multiple beams without requiring any moving parts or complex electronic beam-forming networks. As a tradeoff, a separate receiver or switching network is required to accommodate each feed antenna. This aspect of the system, however, is outside the scope of research for this thesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the experiment was to verify the effect of different feed additives in nutrition of Cobb 500 broiler chickens  on the sensory quality of breast and thigh muscle modified by baking at temperature 200 ºC for 60 minutes. The experiment included 250 one-day-old Cobb 500 hybrid chickens, which were divided into 5 groups (n= 50) : control (I) and experimental groups (E 1 with Agolin Poultry at doses of 100 mg. kg - 1, E 2 with Agolin Tannin Plus at doses of 500 mg. kg - 1, E 3 with Biostrong 510 +FortiBac at doses of 1000 mg. kg - 1 and E 4 with Agolin Acid at doses of 1000 mg. kg - 1). The chickens were fed during 42 days of age by ad libitum system with feed mixtures: BR 1 starter feed mixture (until the of 10 th day of age), BR 2 growth feed mixture (from 11 th to 20 th day of age), BR 3 growth feed mixture (from 21 st to 35 th days of age) and BR 4 <b>final</b> <b>feed</b> mixture (from 36 th to 42 nd days of age). Feed mixtures were produced with coccidiostats in powder form. Panellists evaluate aroma, juiciness, taste and tenderness on 5 point hedonic scale where 1 (the worst) and 5 (the best) were the extremes of each characteristic. Significant {{differences were found between}} control and experimental group E 3 in juiciness and tenderness of breast muscles and between control and experimental group E 2 in smell of thigh muscles. Sensory evaluation of breast and thigh muscles in Cobb 500 chickens after application of different feed additives indicated that these additives have not worsened the quality of meat. The highest sensory score was obtained in experimental group E 4 (with addition of Agolin Acid at the dose of 1000 mg. kg - 1). Normal 0 21 false false false CS JA X-NONE <!

40|$|The antihyperglycemic and {{antioxidant}} {{effects of}} water extract of local Viscum album in alloxanizedrats were investigated. This study performed during 2009 in Babol University of medical sciences (Mazandaran Province, Iran). V. album leaves growing on oaks collected and extracted with hot water. The 90 animals {{that were used}} in this investigation were male Wistar rats. 60 rats were gavaged with 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day of V. album extract. One hour after <b>final</b> <b>feeding,</b> freshly prepared alloxan injected subcutaneously. Then blood glucose level was measured according to glucose oxidase method. The antioxidant activity of serum was determined by FRAP assay and serum insulin level was measured with ELISA. The administration of V. album extract (500 and 1000 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced the increase in serum glucose concentration in alloxan-hyperglycemic rats. Both the extracts from V. album enhance the serum insulin level as compared to control rats. Serum antioxidant activity in low dose of extract was significantly higher at 48 and 72 h after alloxan injection. Serum antioxidant activity in the high dose was significantly higher at 24, 48 and 72 h. This study demonstrated that V. album extract reduced the blood glucose and increases the antioxidant power of alloxanized-rats. Much more work is clearly needed before phytotherapy for diabetes can be advanced to the clinic. Â© 2011 Academic Journals...|$|R
