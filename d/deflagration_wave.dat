Like gunpowder, cordite is classified as a low explosive because of its slow burning rates and consequently low brisance.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the rigorous formulation of a two-phase reactive flow model to describe steady deflagrations in reactive granular propellants. It {{is thought that}} granular propellants {{have the capability to}} provide significant gas generation and thus increased thrust in a rocket engine. It has been hypothesized that the normal operation of such an engine would consist of a constant velocity <b>deflagration</b> <b>wave</b> propagating through a mixture of propellant grains and gas. To predict the features of such a wave, steady deflagrations in granulated solid propellants have been studied using an improved two-phase reactive flow model. The improved model uses a time-dependent pore collapse equation to guarantee the unsteady one-dimensional equations are hyperbolic, conserves mass, momentum, and energy for the mixture, conserves the total number of particles, can accommodate density changes in the particles, and is capable of predicting steady detonations. At the point of complete reaction, an equivalent two-phase Rayleigh line and Hugoniot, independent of the wave structure, can be identified.

Displacement speed and Damköhler number analyses reveal that high temperature fluctuation induces <b>deflagration</b> <b>waves</b> at the reaction fronts such that mean {{heat release rate}} increases more slowly and more spread out in time, consequently preventing excessive rate of pressure rise throughout the ignition process. The propagation characteristics of <b>deflagration</b> <b>waves</b> of different PRF/air mixtures are almost the same such that the overall combustion characteristics of different PRF/air mixtures become nearly identical and thus, the effect of fuel composition on the ignition vanishes.

In the DNSs, temperature and velocity fluctuations are superimposed on the initial scalar fields with different PRF compositions. In general, {{it was found that}} the mean heat release rate increases slowly and the overall combustion occurs rapidly with increasing thermal stratification regardless of the fuel composition. In addition, the effect of the fuel composition on the ignition characteristics of PRF/air mixtures was found to be significantly reduced with increasing thermal stratification. Chemical explosive mode (CEM) and displacement speed analyses verified that nascent ignition kernels induced by hot spots due to a high degree of thermal stratification usually develop into <b>deflagration</b> <b>waves</b> rather than spontaneous auto-ignition at reaction fronts and as such, the mean heat release rate becomes more distributed over time. These analyses also revealed that the fuel composition effect vanishes as the degree of thermal stratification is increased because the deflagration mode of combustion, of which propagation characteristics are nearly identical for different PRF/air mixtures, becomes more prevailing with increasing degree of thermal stratification. Ignition Damköhler number was proposed to quantify the successful development of <b>deflagration</b> <b>waves</b> from nascent ignition kernels; for cases with large ignition Damköhler number, turbulence with high intensity and short timescale can advance the overall combustion by increasing the overall turbulent flame area instead of homogenizing initial mixture inhomogeneities. close...|$|R

40|$|The {{combustion}} mode in a steady-flow {{propulsion system}} {{has a strong}} influence on the overall efficiency of the system. To evaluate {{the relative merits of}} different modes, we propose that it is most appropriate to keep the upstream stagnation state fixed and the wave stationary within the combustor. Because of the variable wave speed and upstream stagnation state, the conventional Hugoniot analysis of combustion waves is inappropriate for this purpose. To remedy this situation, we propose a new formulation of the analysis of stationary combustion waves for a fixed initial stagnation state, which we call the stagnation Hugoniot. For a given stagnation enthalpy, we find that stationary detonation waves generate a higher entropy rise than <b>deflagration</b> <b>waves.</b> The combustion process generating the lowest entropy increment is found to be constant-pressure combustion. These results clearly demonstrate that the minimum entropy property of detonations derived from the conventional Hugoniot analysis does not imply superior performance in all propulsion systems. This finding reconciles previous analysis of flowpath performance analysis of detonation-based ramjets with the thermodynamic cycle analysis of detonation-based propulsion systems.

Energy-momentum conservation and baryon number conservation constrain the possible temperature jump across the front.

In particular the {{effect of a}}n admixture of hadronic matter in the quark phase (e. g. in the form of bubbles) is considered in detail. In the absence of admixture the transition proceeds via a detonation transition and is accompanied by a substantial super-cooling of the quark-gluon plasma phase.

40|$|Successfully attacking {{underground}} storage facilities for {{chemical and biological}} (C/B) weapons is an important mission area for the Department of Defense. The fate of a C/B agent during an attack depends critically on the pressure and thermal environment that the agent experiences. The initial environment {{is determined by the}} blast wave from an explosive device. The byproducts of the detonation provide a fuel source that burn when mixed with oxidizer (after burning). Additional energy can be released by the ignition of the C/B agent as it mixes with the explosion products and the air in the chamber. Hot plumes venting material from any openings in the chamber can provide fuel for additional energy release when mixed with additional oxidizer. Assessment of the effectiveness of current explosives as well as the development of new explosive systems requires a detailed understanding of all of these modes of energy release. Using methodologies based on the use of higher-order Godunov schemes combined with Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), implemented in a parallel adaptive framework suited to the massively parallel computer systems provided by the DOD High-Performance Computing Modernization program, we use a suite of programs to develop predictive models for the simulation of the energetics of blast <b>waves,</b> <b>deflagration</b> <b>waves</b> and ejecta plumes.

40|$|The {{conditions}} that are required for DDT are studied in the present thesis {{by focusing on the}} final phase of the onset of detonation. A series of experiments were carried out where high speed turbulent deflagrations were generated downstream of a perforated plate by reflecting a CJ detonation upstream from the plate. Four different detonation tubes were used to investigate scaling effects. Four different fuels (acetylene, hydrogen, propane, and ethylene) were used with either pure oxygen or air as an oxidizer to investigate the effect of mixture sensitivity on the onset of detonation. In some cases, fuel-oxygen mixtures were diluted with either nitrogen or argon. Perforated plates with various hole diameters and hole spacings were used in order to control the turbulence parameters in the reacting downstream flow. A theoretical study was also carried out to determine the various flow fields as well as the ignition processes via turbulent mixing. It is found that a high speed turbulent deflagration traveling at about the CJ deflagration speed of the mixture (around 800 to 1200 m/s, depending on the given mixture) is required for the onset of detonation in a smooth tube. This critical ve locity is found to be rather insensitive to boundary conditions, which supports the conclusion that critical deflagrations are driven by the expansion of the combustion products (similar to a CJ detonation) and are dependent on the energetics of the mixture rather than on transport rates. The ignition mechanism in a critical deflagration differs from that of a CJ detonation and is effected by the turbulent mixing of combustion products with the unburned mixture. Therefore, intense turbulence is required in the reaction zone. Since the initial plate generated turbulence decays, the sustained propagation of a critical <b>deflagration</b> <b>wave</b> in a smooth tube relies on "flame generated turbulence" where the high temperature sensitivity of the mixture can mantain the turbulence in the reaction zone. It is also found that the critical deflagration is comprised of a leading shock wave followed closely by an extended turbulent reaction zone rather than the conventional shock wave followed by a distinct thin flame. Once a critical <b>deflagration</b> <b>wave</b> is established, the onset of detonation requires the generation of transverse waves that couple to the reactions and are sustained by the chemical energy release as in a cellular detonation. The onset of detonation can be effected by the amplification (via the Rayleigh criterion) of repeatedly reflected transverse waves resonating with the reaction zone in a confined tube. It can also occur via the formation of a local explosion centre where an overdriven detonation bubble and the accompanying retonation wave is formed in the turbulent reaction zone...|$|E

We confirm the sensitivity of the p-process on the initial distribution of s-nuclei. We show that the initial C/O ratio in the WD does not much affect the yield of p-nuclei. On the other hand, the abundance of 22 Ne left after the s-processing has a large influence on the p-process via 22 Ne(alpha,n) reaction. We find that about 50 % of p-nuclides are co-produced when normalized to their solar abundances in all adopted cases of seed distribution. Mo and Ru, which are largely underproduced in Type II supernovae (SNe II), are produced more than in SNe II although they are underproduced with respect to the yield levels of other p-nuclides. The ratios between p-nuclei and iron in the ejecta are larger than the solar ratios by a factor of 1. 2. We also compare the yields of oxygen, iron, and p-nuclides in SNe Ia and SNe II and suggest that SNe Ia could make a larger contribution than SNe II to the solar system content of p-nuclei.

40|$|Self-propagating {{high-temperature}} synthesis (SHS) {{has been}} used to form many materials. SHS generally involves mixing reactants together (e. g., metal powders) and igniting the mixture such that a combustion (<b>deflagration)</b> <b>wave</b> passes though the mixture. The imposition of an electric field (AC or DC) across SHS reactants has been shown to have a marked effect on the dynamics of wave propagation and on the nature, composition, and homogeneity of the product. The use of an electric field with SHS has been termed "field-assisted SHS". Combustion wave velocities and temperatures are directly affected by the field, which is typically perpendicular to the average wave velocity. The degree of activation by the field (e. g., combustion rate) is related to the current density distribution within the sample, and is therefore related to the temperature-dependent spatial distribution of the effective electrical conductivity of reactants and products. Furthermore, the field can influence other important SHS-related phenomena including capillary flow, mass-transport in porous media, and Marangoni flows. These phenomena are influenced by gravity in conventional SHS processes (i. e., without electric fields). As a result the influence of the field on SHS under reduced gravity is expected to be different than under normal gravity. It is also known that heat loss rates from samples, which can depend significantly on gravity, can influence final products in SHS. This research program is focused on studying field-assisted SHS under reduced gravity conditions. The broad objective of this research program is to understand the role of an electric field in SHS reactions under conditions where gravity-related effects are suppressed. The research will allow increased understanding of fundamental aspects of field-assisted SHS processes as well as synthesis of materials that cannot be formed in normal gravity...|$|E
40|$|Pulse Detonation {{technology}} {{offers the potential}} for substantial increases in thrust and fuel efficiency in subsonic and supersonic flight Mach ranges {{through the use of}} a detonative vs. deflagrative combustion process. One of the approaches to reliably obtain a fuel-air detonation is to accelerate a <b>deflagration</b> combustion <b>wave</b> to detonation through the use of turbulence devices, known as detonation-to-deflagration transition. Current geometries for deflagration-to-detonation transition sacrifice much of the gains through losses from high velocity flows over obstacle fields required for detonation initiation. In this study, experimental swept ramp obstacle fields were characterized in an effort to realize decreased pressure losses while still creating the gas dynamic and turbulence necessary for detonation initiation. Characterization included measurement of pressure loss across the combustor during "cold flow" operation with no ignition or fuel present, and detonability testing that employed ion probe measurement of combustion wave velocity. Minimizing pressure losses existing in current designs will result in dramatic improvement of system performance. In addition to swept ramp fields, other configurations were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and subjected to performance testing. Of particular interest were obstacles of similar blockage area, but without the swept sides associated with streamwise vorticity in the flow field. Testing of unswept configurations allowed insight into the mechanisms for DDT and narrowed the field of practical obstacle geometries...|$|R
50|$|The {{wave motion}} {{through the air}} masses should not be {{confused}} with the separate motions of the masses themselves. At the start of <b>deflagration,</b> the pressure <b>wave</b> immediately moves through both air masses, while the gas expansion (due to combustion heat) is just beginning in the combustion zone. The intake air mass will be rapidly accelerated outward behind the pressure wave, because its mass is relatively small. The tailpipe air mass will follow the outgoing pressure wave much more slowly. Also, the eventual flow reversal will take place much sooner in the intake, due to its smaller air mass. The timing of the wave motions is determined basically by the lengths of the intake and main tube of the engine; the timing of mass motions is determined mostly by the volumes and exact shapes of these sections. Both are affected by local gas temperatures.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new, fully {{conservative}} {{version of the}} ghost fluid method applicable for tracking material interfaces, inert shocks, and both <b>deflagration</b> and detonation <b>waves</b> {{in as many as}} three spatial dimensions. The exact discrete conservation properties are most important when tracking inert shocks and detonation waves, so that is the focus of this paper. In particular, we address the inviscid reactive Euler equations in the context of stiff detonation waves on coarse grids. The main difficulty here arises when the time scales of the chemical reaction are significantly shorter than the time scales of the fluid dynamics leading to a stiff source term and nonphysical wave phenomena. We use the level set method to track the location of the detonation wave and the ghost fluid method to treat the discontinuous quantities across the inert shock portion of that wave. This leads to a sharp non-smeared shock profile alleviating the nonphysical wave phenomena...|$|R
