50|$|<b>Edoxudine</b> (or edoxudin) is an {{antiviral}} drug. It is {{an analog}} of thymidine, a nucleoside.|$|E
50|$|Mercuration of the 2'-deoxyuridine 1 {{leads to}} the {{organometallic}} derivative 2; reaction of that with ethylene in the presence dilithiopalladium tetrachloride gives the alkylation product 3; this is reduced catalytically in situ. There is thus obtained the antiviral agent <b>edoxudine</b> 4.|$|E
40|$|The {{penetration}} of 5 -ethyl- 2 '-deoxyuridine (<b>edoxudine,</b> Aedurid) from gel base {{with and without}} the addition of urea and other adjuvant has been studied in an in vitro model using guinea pig skin. The formulation of 3 % <b>edoxudine</b> gel with 5 % urea showed the best results. In vivo experiments on hairless mice infected intracutaneously with herpes simplex virus type 1 also showed this formulation's good efficacy as compared to other formulations. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Treatment for {{recurrent}} genital herpes using <b>edoxudine</b> 3 % {{cream for}} 5 days was evaluated in 200 {{patients in a}} randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinic-initiated trial. Lesion tenderness was predictive of and more sensitive and longer-lasting than the symp-tom of pain, Among patients receiving placebo, times to crusting (P =. 043), cessation of investi-gator-observed signs (P =. 005), lesion-associated signs (P =. 02), and groin signs (P =. 05) were longer in women. <b>Edoxudine</b> reduced viral shedding in men (mean 2. 7 vs. 3. 4 days, P =. 009) and women (2. 0 days vs. 3. 5 days, P =. 0001). Loss of investigator-observed signs (4. 4 vs. 6. 2 days, P =. 002), investigator-observed lesion tenderness (P =. 01), lesion signs (P =. 02), groin adenopa-thy (P =. 01), and tenderness (P =. 01) occurred earlier in women taking <b>edoxudine.</b> <b>Edoxudine</b> was well-tolerated and reduced several signs of herpes in women. Its clinical role in recurrent genital herpes remains to be fully determined. Genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection {{continues to be a}} major public health concern [1 - 3]. Although primary infections are more severe, recurrences are far more frequent and may remain troublesome and uncomfortable for the pa...|$|E
