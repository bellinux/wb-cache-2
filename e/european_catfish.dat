40|$|International audienceThe <b>European</b> <b>catfish,</b> Silurus glanis, {{was widely}} {{introduced}} in western Europe, {{and it has}} now established self-sustaining populations in numerous large rivers of western France. Using data collected from surveys conducted by the French National Agency for Water and Aquatic Environment (Onema) from 1989 to 2010 in more than 500 sites throughout the country (10636 electrofishing surveys), we investigated {{the potential impact of}} the <b>European</b> <b>catfish</b> on fish communities in French rivers. In {{the first part of the}} analysis, we compared trends observed before and after the <b>European</b> <b>catfish</b> was established at given sites (before–after analysis). Species richness, evenness and diversity decreased significantly after the <b>European</b> <b>catfish</b> was established at 1. 4 %, 1. 4 % and 5. 8 % of the sites, respectively.

40|$|<b>European</b> <b>catfish,</b> Silurus glanis L., is {{the second}} largest {{freshwater}} fish in Europe. The species is very popular among the farmers, as {{it is one of}} the most promising European aquaculture species. Despite the growing importance of <b>European</b> <b>catfish</b> in freshwater aquaculture, the genetic data available on this species are still limited. The main purpose of the present study was to develop a reliable, feasible genetic protocol for future studies on <b>European</b> <b>catfish</b> populations and broodstocks in Poland. The genetic characteristics of the tested fish group were based on genetic parameters such as the polymorphism information content (PIC), the effective population size (Ne), the inbreeding coefficient (Fis), and the Garza-Williamson index (M), among others. Additionally, the potential effects of a genetic bottleneck on the genetic variation of the broodstock were examined. The genetic analysis protocol described in this study can be used to establish genetic-based records for <b>European</b> <b>catfish</b> broodstocks, including for sperm cryobanking. This approach will be useful for elaborating the selection procedures that allow for optimal assemblages of spawning pairs in artificial reproduction.

40|$|The {{object of}} this work was to verify {{influence}} of feed and surroundings on lipids content and fatty acids spectrum in musculature of <b>European</b> <b>catfish</b> (Silurus glanis) cultivated in intensive conditions. Within years 2000 – 2002 feeding tests with <b>European</b> <b>catfish</b> of initial weight from 60 to 500 grams were executed. For rearing of fish recirculation system at Department of Fisheries and Hydrobiology of Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry in Brno and facility of farm in Tisová (Czech Fisheries Company, s. r. o. of Marianské Lázně) using flow through system warmed by water from the Tisová thermal power plant were used. Feeds for salmonid fish with differential protein (35 – 48, 5  %) and lipid (13 – 26 %) content were tested. The temperature of water in all fluctuated was from 17 – 26  °C. Frequency of feeding was three times a day. Quantity of feeding dose varied depending on weight of fish from 1 to 2  % of weight of stocking rate. Spectrum of fatty acids in used feeds corresponds to composition of fatty acids in musculature of <b>European</b> <b>catfish</b> (Silurus glanis). This spectrum is influenced by quality of used components during feed production; breeding surroundings did not show any influence on spectrum of fatty acids in musculature of fish. SFA content was in range 27 – 32, 60  %. Rate n– 3 /n– 6 PUFA was highest in trial TISOVÁ 2001 (3, 78). When compared Aqualife 17 feed, the narrowest rate n– 3 /n– 6 PUFA (1, 19) was found out in recirculation system in during the year 2000.

Catfish consumed significantly more energy within the CA compared to the rest of the HR area. In addition, energetic costs of space use within a large area were lower. These results generally indicate that utilization of larger areas is related to less demanding activities, such as patrolling and searching for new resources and mates.

About 62% of the species and subspecies are endemic, as are 4-6 genera (depending on taxonomic treatment). The lake proper has 115 natives, including 73 endemics (63.5%). Among the more than 50 genera in the lake proper, 3-4 are endemic: Anatirostrum, Caspiomyzon, Chasar (often included in Ponticola) and Hyrcanogobius. By far the most numerous families in the lake proper are gobies (35 species and subspecies), cyprinids (32) and clupeids (22).

With the exception of 1 species, all 20 fish species were infected by A. crassus larvae; however, the prevalence and intensity of infection varied widely. Six species (asp, white bream, Chinese rasbora, pike, river goby, <b>European</b> <b>catfish),</b> hitherto unreported as paratenic hosts, also proved to be infected by larvae in Lake Balaton. Of the 13 fish species examined in large numbers, ruffe and <b>European</b> <b>catfish</b> showed the highest prevalence of infection (100 %), followed by river goby (83 %), white bream (79 %) and bleak (68 %). Of these 13 fish species, ruffe showed the highest intensity of infection by live larvae (mean intensity: 39. 3 3 rd stage larvae, L 3), followed by <b>European</b> <b>catfish</b> (mean number of live larvae: 26. 9) and river goby (mean number of live larvae: 9. 1). The mean number of live L 3 in bleak, a species regarded as the principal food source for eels, was 4. 1. Specimens containing only dead or both dead and live larvae were much more common in cyprinid fishes than in species belonging to other taxonomical entities. In these fish, the process of encapsulation and subsequent necrosis of live larvae could also be observed. With knowledge of the feeding habits of eels, it appears that bleak play the most important role in the transmission of anguillicolosis.

Here we studied the trophic ecology of non-native <b>European</b> <b>catfish</b> {{in a large}} river system in south-western France using stomach content and stable isotope analyses (SIA). We used fin samples for SIA of catfish and hence tested the validity of using fin tissue {{as a proxy for}} muscle in SIA. The mean δ 15 N and δ 13 C values analysed from fin tissues did not differ from those analysed from muscle tissue and reflected strong and consistent relationships (r 2 = 0. 95 for carbon and r 2 = 0. 98 for nitrogen). The δ 15 N values varied almost 5 ‰ among the analysed catfish individuals, while δ 13 C values varied > 5 ‰. Total length of these catfish ranged from 200 to 2240 mm and was correlated with δ 15 N and especially with δ 13 C values. Although catfish length and δ 15 N values were positively correlated, the mean trophic positions of catfish increased only slightly from smaller individuals to larger ones (4. 3 to 4. 7). However, larger catfish were considerably 13 C-enriched in their δ 13 C values compared to smaller individuals and had up to 4 ‰ higher δ 13 C values than their expected aquatic prey. This might indicate frequent consumption of mammals and/or non-aquatic birds by the larger sized individuals, which were found in the catfish stomachs...|$|E
40|$|Circular {{single-stranded}} DNA viral genomes {{had been}} identified worldwide in different species and in environmental samples. Among them, viruses belonging to the genus Circovirus of the family Circoviridae are present in birds and pigs, and recently, they were detected in barbels. The present study reports the identification of a new circovirus in fish. PCR amplification and sequencing were used to identify the novel circular DNA virus in <b>European</b> <b>catfish</b> (Silurus glanis). Full genome characterization and phylogenetic analysis showed that the virus belonged to the family Circoviridae {{and that it was}} distantly related to the previously described barbel circovirus. Nucleotide sequence data reported here are available in the GenBank database under the accession numbers JQ 011377 and JQ 011378...|$|E
