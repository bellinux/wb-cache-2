40|$|A {{paper by}} Selden and Sing (2008) {{reminds us of}} {{what was at stake}} 45 years ago, when Emmett Hall {{recommended}} universal public medical insurance over private–public alternatives. While focusing exclusively on the United States, it also helps to explain why universal pharmacare is being diverted into that same private–public dead end through public “catastrophic” coverage. Governments finance, through many different programs, most US health expenditure. Spending programs – Medicaid, Medicare and others – primarily benefit the unhealthy and unwealthy. However, benefits of the largest program, the tax exemption for private insurance, are heavily tilted towards the highest incomes and are essentially unrelated to health. This pattern (also found in Canada) may help explain political support for private insurance, despite its <b>excessive</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>cost</b> and inability to cover those in greatest need...|$|R

The thesis concluded that there were potential benefits to the government if a standard could be developed. However, a standard that could meet the objectives of the Cost Accounting Standards Board did not appear feasible, primarily because of difficulties in the accurate measure­ment of various capacity levels and because such a standard could lead to unduly complex accounting procedures and <b>excessive</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>costs.</b> [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E

For the past 20 years, health care spending has risen at rates higher than the gross national product. As many as 35 million people are without health insurance.

Analysis shows that efforts cannot be reduced by changing the definition of an installation in the Emissions Trading Directive or by treating district heating network as single large installation instead of multiple small installations.

40|$|Recent {{international}} {{experience has}} shown that excessively complex administrative procedures, required to establish, and operate a business, discourage inflows of foreign direct investment. The authors present a new database on the administrative costs faced by private investors in 32 developing countries. The database is much more comprehensive than the existing sources, as it contains not only information on general entry procedures, such as business and tax registration, but also captures regulation on land access, site development, import procedures, and inspections, Thedata include measures {{on the number of}} procedures, direct monetary costs, and time. The cost of administrative procedures vary significantly across countries. The most important barriers appear to be the delays associated with securing land access, and obtaining building permits, which in several countries, take more than two years. Countries that impose <b>excessive</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>costs</b> on entry, tend to be equally intrusive in firm operations, thereby weakening the argument that barriers to entry, are a substitute for the government's unwillingness, or inability to regulate enterprise operations. The level of administrative costs is positively correlated with corruption incidence, and exhibits a negative correlation with the quality of governance, degree of openness, and public wages. These correlations suggest that administrative reforms, need to be incorporated into the broader agenda for reforms, such as trade and financial liberalization, the fight against corruption, and public sector administration.

40|$|In recent years, patent law’s inequitable conduct {{doctrine}} {{has attracted}} considerable attention from judges, legislators, patent lawyers, and commentators, culminating {{most recently in}} the Federal Circuit’s decision to revise {{certain aspects of the}} doctrine in its en banc decision in Therasense, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson 2 ̆ 6 Co. Building on the work of other scholars, this Article proposes an instrumental view of the doctrine as, ideally, a tool for inducing patent applicants to disclose the optimal quantity of information relating to the patentability of their inventions; it then presents a formal model of the applicant’s choices in deciding how much information to reveal. The model suggests, among other things, that even after Therasense the conditions that trigger a finding of inequitable conduct are at best only a rough proxy for the conditions that define optimal disclosure. The model also illuminates how, both pre- and post-Therasense, the doctrine poorly defines many of the variables affecting a rational applicant’s decisionmaking process, and thus potentially encourages risk-averse agents to overdisclose. Although the model neither confirms nor refutes critics’ claims that the doctrine routinely induces overdisclosure and <b>excessive</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>costs,</b> the model demonstrates how various reforms, including but not limited to those adopted in Therasense, can be expected to reduce these reputed consequences. Finally, however, the model suggests that the need for some type of inequitable conduct doctrine may be greater in a regime like that of the United States, which at present lacks an effective system for post-grant oppositions. Conversely, if the United States adopted a post-grant opposition system, the need for a robust inequitable conduct doctrine would decline...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{challenges}} {{the conventional wisdom}} that claimants in class action settlement funds and other settlement funds make independent and rational settlement decisions. Cognitive psychologists and behavioral economists have long examined the way people make judgments and choices. Such studies show that decisionmakers routinely change their minds based on their view of the status quo, the timing of the decision, and the presence of seemingly irrelevant choices. Because of these cognitive biases, people will buy things they do not want, save too little for retirement, and make risky choices about their health and well-being based on the timing, context, and framing of the decision. Applying findings from cognitive psychology, I argue that people will make the same kinds of irrational decisions about their settlement options in a large settlement fund. As a result, cognitive biases threaten to undermine many of the stated purposes of large settlement funds-to provide claimants with access, efficiency, and equity superior to what they could obtain in traditional litigation. Accordingly, 2 ̆ 2 fund designers 2 ̆ 2 -judges, lawmakers, and special masters-should adjust settlement procedures to account for cognitive bias. I call this process 2 ̆ 2 funding irrationality 2 ̆ 2 -identifying and, in some cases, capitalizing on people 2 ̆ 7 s cognitive biases in large settlement funds by altering the context, timing, and sequence of their settlement options. Fund designers, however, should avoid reforms that unduly eliminate settlement options, or that impose <b>excessive</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>costs.</b> Rather, the benefits of any reform-preventing avoidable harm to irrational claimants-must outweigh the potential costs, including the value of client autonomy, the chance of error, and the burden on the courts and public administrators...|$|E

40|$|States have {{traditionally}} relied on taxes {{to finance the}} expansion of services, and most states have enacted broad-based income taxes which yield additional revenue without raising tax rates. Federal grant-in-aid and revenue sharing funds also increase a state 2 ̆ 7 s fiscal resources and relieve pressure for additional taxes. Revenue Sharing was intended to replace restricted grants-in-aid and permit {{state and local governments}} to receive federal funds pursuant to an allocation basis which rewarded state and local tax efforts. An unutilized provision of Revenue Sharing provides for the optional piggybacking of state income taxes upon the federal income tax. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would act as the state 2 ̆ 7 s collector and enforcer. The state, however, would lose some control, both legislatively and judicially, over its personal income tax laws. All judicial challenges, except those involving state constitutional questions or issues pertaining to the relationship between state and federal governments, would be tried in federal courts. Revenue Sharing is a five year experiment; piggybacking has no time limits and appears to have been envisioned by Congress as a long-term solution for state and local financial problems. Two or more states, accounting for at least five percent of the, taxpayers in the United States, must request federal collection of their individual income taxes before the Act can take effect.
