Priscilla woke up when she was removing the knife due to Joe pointing out her fingerprints were on it, so had her throat slit. When Diane was hiding the body in Tom's room, Muriel saw her so was stabbed. The murderess did not have time to conceal the knife, but was able to wipe her fingerprints clean.

500|$|Patrick van der Eem, working {{undercover}} for De Vries, had befriended Van der Sloot, who {{was unaware}} {{that he was}} being taped when he said that Holloway had suffered some kind of seizure while having sex on the beach. After failing to revive her, Van der Sloot said that he summoned a friend named Daury. The two men neither phoned for medical help nor checked Natalee to determine if she might still be alive. [...] Then, according to Van der Sloot, Daury volunteered to load her on a boat, and <b>he</b> <b>dumped</b> Natalee's body into the sea. The prosecutor in Aruba determined the video was admissible, but the evidence was deemed [...] "insufficient" [...] to warrant Van der Sloot's, or anyone's, arrest. Although the taped confession appeared damning, Van der Sloot argued that he was lying to impress Van der Eem, who he believed was a drug dealer.|$|E

500|$|A {{few of the}} Robinsons {{actually}} {{tried to}} actively take revenge on the occupying forces. The most famous of these, who became a local legend, was an individual known only as [...] "Ares" [...] (after the Greek god of war), described by Gluth-Nowowiejski, {{based on interviews with}} the Robinsons he conducted. Ares, active in the Śródmieście district, staged numerous ambushes of German soldiers, in at least one case using an improvised explosive device. According to Gluth-Nowowiejski's sources, he would leave behind graffiti of his name, as well as slogans such as [...] "Hitler kaput". Other messages included communications to the German soldiers. In one case <b>he</b> <b>dumped</b> a body of a soldier he had killed with the note: [...] "This awaits all of you in Warsaw". In another he wrote: [...] "Ares is a ghost, not matter – your search for him is useless". Eventually, Ares met his demise when the Germans left some poisoned food for him to find. Soon they discovered a man in the ruins who was obviously sick from having eaten it. He shot at them before taking his own life. According to some sources, other individuals took on Ares' struggle but used the names of other Greek Gods as their signature.|$|E

2500|$|After its {{repair the}} 81 GR made {{a second and}} final attempt to regain the record. Even during {{take-off}} from Istres on 18 October 1932, Marmoz noticed the aileron controls were slack, the ailerons themselves vibrated and there were large oscillations of the wings, with amplitude as much as 1m.

It {{turned out that the}} wing oscillations were excited by a very stiff undercarriage suspension that transmitted ground forces into the wings, the motion of which damaged the aileron control runs.|$|E

He took her to a remote campsite in the deserts north of Los Angeles (which was the site of the alleged rape for which Bradford was {{awaiting trial}}), photographed her in a variety of modelling poses, and then strangled her. After killing her, Bradford sliced off her tattoos and removed her blouse; he then transported her body to a Hollywood parking lot, where <b>he</b> <b>dumped</b> the corpse in an adjoining alley.

2500|$|On October 11, 1992, David Robinson {{received}} wide {{media attention}} when <b>he</b> <b>dumped</b> {{the ashes of}} his partner, Warren Krause, {{on the grounds of}} the White House in protest of President George H.W. Bush’s inaction to fight AIDS. Robinson reported that this action was inspired by Wojnarowicz's 1991 memoir Close to the Knives, which imagined [...] "what it would be like if, each time a lover, friend or stranger died of this disease, their friends, lovers or neighbors would take the dead body and drive with it in a car a hundred miles an hour to Washington DC and blast through the gates of the White House and come to a screeching halt before the entrance and dump their lifeless form on the front steps." [...] In 1996, Wojnarowicz's own ashes were scattered on the White House lawn.|$|E
2500|$|Perelman {{jumped back}} into the savings & loan game {{in a big way}} in 1994 by buying First Nationwide from the Ford Motor Company for $664 million. [...] Ford held onto $1.8 billion of First Nationwide's assets valued at $444 million, two-thirds of which were {{considered}} troubled assets, offered to buy back up to $500 million of First Nationwide's other $7.9 billion of assets that went bad in the future, and gave Perelman $50 million to cover potential severance payments. [...] Perelman quickly boosted its portfolio, adding $10 billion worth of mortgages in exchange for a $175 million payment to Resolution Trust Corporation. [...] Before 1995 ended, Perelman added two more thrifts to his collective: SFFed's $4.1 billion of assets for $250 million and Home Federal Financial's $735 million of assets and $662 million of deposits for $70.6 million. [...] Just as quickly as he added assets, branches, and deposits in California, <b>he</b> <b>dumped</b> what he had elsewhere in the country. In 1995 alone he sold off 79 branches with $4.3 billion in deposits spread out across five states. 1996 went a little slower, but not eventfully. He acquired California Federal Bancorp for $1.2 billion, creating the 4th largest thrift in the country with $32.3 billion in assets. In 1997, another $3.3 billion in mortgages were added courtesy of WMC Mortgage but it was an otherwise quiet year for First Nationwide. In 1998, Perelman negotiated a stock swap with Golden State Bancorp to create the third largest thrift in the country with $50 billion of assets. The deal left Golden State's shareholders the majority, but Perelman's camp still controlled the company. Everything remained quiet until May 2002 when Citigroup announced plans to buy Golden State for $5.8 billion, but ultimately reduced the offer to $4.9 billion due to a stock drop. Citigroup's final offer was 0.821 shares of Citigroup common stock and $7.47 cash for every share of Golden State exchanged, which converted Perelman's 43 million shares of Golden State into $321,210,000 in cash plus 36,124,000 shares of Citigroup. All things considered, Perelman expected to make about $2 billion off the deal, but because he had quasi-sold many of his shares in the past, he probably gained substantially less than that.|$|E
