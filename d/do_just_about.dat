500|$|During the strike, the NFLPA {{promoted}} two [...] "AFC-NFC 'all-star' games." [...] One {{was held}} at RFK Stadium in Washington D.C. on October 17, 1982, and the second {{was held at}} the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum a day later. One of the few stars who did play, future Hall of Fame running back John Riggins, explained [...] "I guess I'll <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> anything for money." [...] Despite a local TV blackout and ticket prices starting at six dollars, neither game drew well; only 8,760 fans attended in Washington, D.C., and just 5,331 attended in Los Angeles. With no NFL games to air, CBS replayed the previous Super Bowl and aired Division III football; Pat Summerall and John Madden, for example, covered a game between Baldwin Wallace and Wittenberg. NBC acquired the rights to Canadian Football League games from ESPN, and aired them with NFL-like production values; the first four games it showed were all blowouts, however, with poor ratings, and the network gave up.|$|E

500|$|Adam Buckman of the New York Post did {{not enjoy}} Madonna's guest appearance, observing that she [...] "proves she'll <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> {{anything}} for attention, including going on a dumb show like Will & Grace [...] Madonna did herself no favors by agreeing {{to participate in a}} cheap, desperate ratings stunt." [...] Nonetheless, Buckman said that in the episode [...] "she delivered her lines capably" [...] and that her role as Liz was with [...] "admirable gusto." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker noted that the singer's appearance was [...] "one of the worst, if most fascinating, celebrity cameos I've ever witnessed." [...] Tucker said that [...] "Madonna-as-TV-actress" [...] defeated [...] "Madonna-as-movie-actress" [...] primarily because [...] "she was paired with a pro like [...] Mullally and had less screen time than she did in her most recent movie dud, Swept Away. According to David Kronke for the Whittier Daily News, [...] "Madonna may have put the kibosh on her video, but not on her guest appearance as Karen's... new best bosom buddy." [...] While Charleston Daily Mails Kevin McDonough reported that Madonna appearing on Will & Grace was [...] "clearly a reprise" [...] of singer Cher's guest stints on the episodes [...] "Gypsies, Tramps and Weed" [...] and [...] "A.I.: Artificial Insemination". McDonough wrote that the cameos made by Cher [...] "made sense", and that the latter [...] "has an ability to laugh at herself that Madonna has never exhibited." [...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald said Will & Grace had been [...] "guilty of some pretty poor stunt casting" [...] and included Madonna as a primary example. Writing for The Times publication, Lisa Verrico noted that Will & Grace was becoming the [...] "new" [...] Friends opining with all the guest stars in season five—Demi Moore, Minnie Driver, and Madonna—that have been featured on the show.|$|E
500|$|As {{production}} continued, Tom Hall {{dubbed the}} game's scripting language [...] "APE" [...] (Anachronox Programming Language). Hall explained, [...] "I call it my new Apple II because it's {{so much fun}} to program in and it takes all the drudgery out of it. It's sort of if you mushed together C, Basic and Java in a way—for programming people it's sort of Windows based. It began as a defined dialogue window, but provided variables so that you could position and move a picture. So from there it grew like UNIX with little bits and pieces, and you have things that initialize data to the window, things that constantly update the window, and things that happen after the window, in little code chunks and with that you can do any little thing." [...] Hall wrote and coded the mini-game Bugaboo for Anachronox in 15 hours to demonstrate the environment's simplicity. Other tools developed for the game were B.E.D. (a battle editor), ION Radiant (for level design, based on QERadiant), NoxDrop (for item and character placement), and Planet (a spline-based camera system coded by Joey Liaw). Ion Storm worked with QuakeEd developer Robert Duffy to create QERadiant, later adapted to ION Radiant. Hall lauded Planet: [...] "you can control entities on paths, trigger events, manipulate particles, and <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> anything you please. One of the more common team beliefs is that the only true limit to Planet is the person controlling it." [...] Hall aimed to provide several end-user modification tools, such as one to allow gamers to create their own MysTech elements. Other programs would allow implementation of new dialogue, voice-acting, and camera work. Ion Storm developed tutorials and documentation for each tool.|$|E

[...] Ann Hornaday from The Washington Post noted the film [...] "works because Lane is one of those actresses who can <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> anything and still earn the audience's undying love."

2500|$|Among the {{negative}} reviews {{is one that}} charges the series {{with a lack of}} originality. Maxie Zeus of Toon Zone argued that the show is [...] "derivative, but obviously so, and shorn of even the best features of what has been stolen." [...] Zeus took issue with the writing, feeling that certain jokes and conventions were [...] "ripped-off" [...] from other shows. Kevin McDonough of Sun Coast Today criticized the show for its plot complexity, constant action, and [...] "characters [...] can <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> anything." [...] McDonough stated that [...] "it's never clear whether P are intended to entertain children or are merely a reflection of grown-up animators engaged in a juvenile lark." [...] Marylin Moss of The Hollywood Reporter described Phineas and Ferb as [...] "Pretty mindless but kids of all ages might find a humorous moment in it."

In 2008, Ashanti, along with others celebrities, taped a PSA to help stop violence and discrimination towards the LGBT community in response to the death of Lawrence King, an eighth-grader at E.O. Green Junior High School who was shot because of his sexual orientation and gender expression. That same year, she launched a special on-line campaign called [...] "I Declare Me..." [...] with Wal-Mart. The campaign's core is a very personal focus on the self-definition and empowerment of women across the United States, with its home base at Ashanti's official website. The campaign creates a safe and inclusive on-line space to for women to share testimonies on the site. Participants are able to openly declare their own breakthroughs, revelations, struggles and victories in every life area they choose: career, birth, death, relationships, and personal situations. [...] "I Declare Me..." [...] also invites women to a virtual discussion with Ashanti on such issues as voter registration, teen obesity, and other concerns facing women today.|$|E
