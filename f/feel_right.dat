[...] I'm like [...] "I'm not a dick, I'm going to tell the truth."

500|$|In August, Stefani {{filed for}} divorce from her husband Gavin Rossdale after almost {{thirteen}} years of marriage. In October, Stefani revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the album and started again, since [...] "t didn't <b>feel</b> <b>right.</b> [...] I didn't feel fulfilled. That record with Benny was done that way because I had just given birth and had just started on The Voice and felt like I should do something in music, but what was I going to do? There wasn't enough time. So I {{tried to make a}} record where I was just kind of involved—which is how {{a lot of people do}} it, but it didn't work for me". She later told Zane Lowe that she had attempted to curate an entire album, but it did not <b>feel</b> <b>right</b> and she needed to write her own material. She also revealed that she felt inspired again and started writing a lot of songs in a rapid progression, revealing: [...] "I think I have enough for probably two albums. [...] I have to write a few more songs, because I feel like, might as well keep going while it's there. [...] I got 20 songs. I have a whole record in eight weeks, but I want to keep writing." [...] Stefani also revealed she had worked with musicians Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Greg Kurstin, in addition to production duo Mattman & Robin and the Stargate production team. The album was completed in January 2016. Stefani revealed in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres on February 25 that [...] "'four of five' songs" [...] were written in the previous month.|$|E

500|$|... "Habits (Stay High)" [...] is a pop and electropop song. In an {{interview}} with AP Entertainment, the singer stated that the song's lyrics describe her behaviour during the time she wrote it, when she was devastated and trying to overcome a former relationship. She also remarked that the main theme of [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] is the suffering she experienced despite her attempts to numb the pain. Echoing this thought, Lo further confessed that: [...] "I can't lie. What I'm singing about is my life. It's the truth. I've had moments where [...] has been a bigger part than it should be. It's hard to admit to, and I could filter it or find another metaphor for it – but it doesn't <b>feel</b> <b>right</b> to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Hubbard {{characterized}} her composition {{style as}} [...] "impressionistic paintings in music", {{in an interview}} with the St. Petersburg Times.

[...] Regarding a potential audience, Hubbard said, [...] "My music is for intelligent listeners, who don't mind if I change chords, and are willing to see what happens next." [...] Explaining why written text did not accompany the songs, Hubbard said, [...] "I wrote lots of poetry.

500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode, [...] ""The Broken Man" [...] gave us back The Hound, but his return felt a little diminished, given the parade of returns we've already seen this year, and there weren't as many notable moments in this chapter as other Game of Thrones episodes. There were some fine scenes, but nothing on par with the show's usual goods, though Lady Mormont was a {{highlight}} and Jaime and the Blackfish's standoff is an interesting scenario, {{not to mention the}} questions raised by Sansa's letter.

500|$|Shortly {{before the}} Wasteland 2 Director’s Cut re-release in 2015, Dunne {{released}} {{a parody of}} the Dire Straits song [...] "Money for Nothing", titled [...] "I want my RPG". The lyrics of the song criticise modern free to play games, microtransactions and downloadable content and express the desire for more games of the old CRPG style. He {{did not include the}} song on any album, saying on Twitter that [...] "It's a parody of someone else's song. Wouldn't <b>feel</b> <b>right</b> to monetise it." [...] Dunne has also used his music to criticise quick time events in his Resident Evil 6 song [...] "Wigglesticks". It has been suggested that other indie games on limited budgets could improve the quality of their music by employing indie musicians such as Miracle of Sound.|$|E

[...] In 2011, when promoting The Family Jewels, Diamandis [...] described her fashion styles as [...] "vintage, cheerleader, and cartoon." [...] Four years later, she described her costumes then as [...] "very badly put together vintage, kind of glittery ensemble", and her outfits for Froot as a [...] "mix of '70s with digital fiberware...something surreal and '70s." ...|$|E

It's just all that formality that confuses me". The performance was ranked number four on Marie Claires [...] "30 Best Brit Award Moments" [...] list.

He finished 33rd in the downhill, 21st in the Giant Slalom, 19th in the Slalom and did not finish in the Super G.

[...] Strategy Informer was not as appreciative of the jump in perspective, noting that the game's maps and engine {{did not appear to be}} designed for the first-person perspective and the mode instead presented itself as [...] "more than a little jarring." [...] While Travis Huinker of Gaming Nexus criticized the game for having poor driving physics, Shack News's Jeff Mattas enjoyed the controls, stating, [...] "Though there are certain liberties taken with the driving physics, they <b>feel</b> <b>right</b> at home with the frantic, arcade-style action." [...] Ultimately, Huinker did not recommend the game, but Lindsey called it [...] "the most fun game that I have played this year".|$|E
