50|$|Intrusions {{are one of}} the {{two ways}} igneous rock can form; the other is <b>extrusive</b> <b>rock,</b> that is, a {{volcanic}} eruption or similar event.

50|$|Quartzolite or silexite is an {{intrusive}} igneous rock, {{in which}} the mineral quartz is more than 90% of the rock's felsic mineral content, with feldspar at up to 10%. Typically, quartz forms more than 60% of the rock, the rest being mostly feldspar although minor amounts of mica or amphibole may also be present. Quartzolite occurs as dykes, sills, veins, bosses and segregation masses. It is an extremely rare type of rock. No <b>extrusive</b> <b>rock</b> equivalent of quartzolite is known. Quartzolite is found in association with greisen and pegmatite.|$|E

Painted Rocks State Park, named after the colorful lichens that cover the granite walls and rhyolite cliffs within the park, offers boating, camping, and fishing. Rhyolite {{is the same as}} granite chemically; however it is an <b>extrusive</b> <b>rock,</b> whereas granite is an intrusive rock. [...] Lucky Peak State Park offers boating, fishing, biking, and even offers its own beach.|$|E
50|$|Specimens of thorite {{generally}} {{come from}} igneous pegmatites and volcanic <b>extrusive</b> <b>rocks,</b> hydrothermal veins and contact metamorphic rocks.

50|$|Pitchstone is a dull black glassy {{volcanic}} rock formed when a felsic viscous lava or magma cools quickly. It {{is similar to}} obsidian but {{is defined by the}} International Union of Geological Sciences as having a higher water content. It is a volcanic glass; however, unlike a glass, pitchstone has an irregular hackly fracture not a conchoidal fracture. That is due to its coarser (than obsidian) crystal structure. Pitchstone has a resinous lustre, or silky in some cases, and a variable composition. Its colour may be mottled, streaked, or uniform brown, red, green, gray, or black. It is an <b>extrusive</b> <b>rock</b> that is very resistant to erosion.|$|E
5000|$|Boninite is a mafic <b>extrusive</b> <b>rock</b> high in both {{magnesium}} and silica, {{thought to}} be usually formed in fore-arc environments, typically {{during the early stages}} of subduction. The rock is named for its occurrence in the Izu-Bonin arc south of Japan. It is characterized by extreme depletion in incompatible trace elements that are not fluid mobile (e.g., the heavy rare-earth elements plus Nb, Ta, Hf) but variable enrichment in the fluid mobile elements (e.g., Rb, Ba, K). They are found almost exclusively in the fore-arc of primitive island arcs (that is, closer to the ocean trench) and in ophiolite complexes thought to represent former fore-arc settings or at least formed above a subduction zone.|$|E

50|$|The {{elemental}} and {{mineralogical composition}} of primary rocks {{is determined by}} the chemical composition of the volcanic or magmatic flow from which it is formed. <b>Extrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> (such as basalt, rhyolite, andesite and obsidian) and intrusive rocks (such as granite, granodiorite, gabbro and peridotite) contain primary minerals including quartz, feldspar, plagioclase, muscovite, biotite, amphibole, pyroxene and olivine in varying concentrations.|$|R
25|$|Because the {{minerals}} are mostly fine-grained, {{it is much}} more difficult to distinguish between the different types of <b>extrusive</b> igneous <b>rocks</b> than between different types of intrusive igneous rocks. Generally, the mineral constituents of fine-grained <b>extrusive</b> igneous <b>rocks</b> can only be determined by examination of thin sections of the rock under a microscope, so only an approximate classification can usually be made in the field.|$|R
50|$|The volcano {{is part of}} the {{so-called}} Tin belt, a territory in the Andes where large tin mineral deposits are found in granitic and <b>extrusive</b> <b>rocks,</b> formed from sulfidation reactions involving the numerous volcanoes in the area.

5000|$|The Wrekin is a {{prominent}} hill {{near the town}} of Telford. The sedimentary rock types are varied around the area, but lava and volcanic ash (tuff) from various volcanic eruptions form this famous landmark. However, The Wrekin itself is not a volcano, and never was. The primary igneous rock on the Wrekin is rhyolite; this has a pinkish colour and is usually banded as it is a slow cooling viscous <b>extrusive</b> <b>rock.</b> A particularly good outcrop of rhyolite exists as you drive between Wellington and Shrewsbury on the new A5 by-pass. Intrusions of igneous rock have been quarried in the past at nearby Ercall Quarry. Here, the main type of igneous rock that can be found is Granophyre. At Ercall Quarry itself, you can see the contact (boundary) between Precambrian rocks and the younger (Cambrian) sedimentary rocks. In the vicinity these contain fossils from the period associated with [...] "the explosion of life".|$|E
50|$|Geologically, Morro Rock, {{located in}} San Luis Obispo County, {{in the town}} of Morro Bay, California, is one of 13 volcanic, {{intrusive}} units that form volcanic plugs (remnant volcanic necks of volcanoes), lava domes, and sheetlike intrusions from Morro Rock southeast 29 km or 18 mi to Islay Hill. The plugs form the distinctive peaks along U.S. Highway 101 just south of San Luis Obispo and south of State Highway 1 from San Luis Obispo to Morro Bay. The rock is composed of dacite, a felsic <b>extrusive</b> <b>rock,</b> intermediate in composition between andesite and rhyolite, {{and is a member of}} the igneous family. Its lithology and composition is a groundmass of plagioclase with amphibole (hornblende), biotite, pyroxene (augite), quartz, and glass; phenocrysts of plagioclase, amphibole and often quartz. Its silica (SiO2) content can range from 63%-69%. The dacite volcanic plugs, lava domes, intrusive sheets, and felsitic rhyolite-dacite between Morro Rock and Islay Hill are part of the Oligocene (27-23 Ma) Mono Rock-Islay Hill Complex. The complex lies east of the San Gregorio-San Simeon-Hosgri fault (SG-SS-H fault). This complex is one of three probable sources of the volcanic clasts within the sandstone and conglomerate of the Miguelito and Edna members of the Pismo Formation in the Point Sur area 145-160 km (90-100 mi) to the north and west of the SG-SS-H fault. Based on paleomagnetic signatures, the 27-23 Ma Morro Rock-Islay Hill Complex was rotated 40'-50',perhaps during late Miocene or early Pliocene time.|$|E
40|$|FUJIMOTO＊２ {{shipboard}} scientific party 81; INDOYO diving cruise (MODEﾕ 98 leg 3) ＊３ Although {{hydrothermal activity}} {{is well documented}} from many fields on most mid-ocean ridges, no hydrothermally mineralized area was known from the ultraslow spreading Southwest Indian Ridge since October 1998 when RV Yokosuka with the submersible Shinkai 6500 investigated in this area. This newly discovered massive sulfide field is located near 27 ° 51 S/ 63 ° 56 E in the 11 th segment west of the Rodriguez Triple Junction. Hydrothermal precipitates were found in a water depth of about 2, 960 m close {{to the top of}} a neovolcanic ridge, informally referred to as Mount Jourdanne. Massive sulfides occur on the ocean floor as smaller mounds with an average size of about 5 m 3. The surface is often weathered and shows therefore a typical reddish to brownish crust. Besides mound-like hydrothermal structures small tube-like chimneys were observed on the ocean floor. These chimney edifices rise for approximately 40 to 50 cm from the floor and are less than 10 cm in diameter. All of the hydrothermal features and structures were spatially related to an E-W trending graben or to smaller fissures and cracks. Furthermore the summit of Mt. Jourdanne is characterized by pillow basalts, tubes and basaltic fragments as well as by basaltic sheet flows including folded, platy and scrambled textures. <b>Extrusive</b> <b>rock</b> assemblages are partly covered by a thin sediment layer...|$|E
25|$|<b>Extrusive</b> igneous <b>rocks,</b> {{also known}} as {{volcanic}} rocks, are formed at the crust's surface {{as a result of}} the partial melting of rocks within the mantle and crust. <b>Extrusive</b> igneous <b>rocks</b> cool and solidify quicker than intrusive igneous rocks. They are formed by the cooling of molten magma on the earth's surface. The magma, which is brought to the surface through fissures or volcanic eruptions, solidifies at a faster rate. Hence such rocks are smooth, crystalline and fine-grained. Basalt is a common <b>extrusive</b> igneous <b>rock</b> and forms lava flows, lava sheets and lava plateaus. Some kinds of basalt solidify to form long polygonal columns. The Giant's Causeway in Antrim, Northern Ireland is an example.|$|R

50|$|The basaltic and andesitic dikes and sills {{that occur}} within the strata {{underlying}} the Cardenas Basalt {{are similar in}} mineralogy and chemistry to the Cardenas volcanic rocks.
