The drugs were incorporated in oil-in-water (O/W) and water-in-oil (W/O) formulations obtained by using soybean oil or squalene as the oil phase. The droplet size, zeta potential, and environmental polarity of the nanocarriers were assessed as physicochemical properties. The O/W and W/O emulsions showed diameters of 216 – 256 and 18 – 125 nm, which, respectively, were {{within the range of}} submicron- and nano-sized dispersions. In vitro diffusion experiments using Franz-type cells and porcine skin were performed. Nude mice were used, and skin fluorescence derived from protoporphyrin IX was documented by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The loading of ALA or mALA into the emulsions resulted in slower release across cellulose membranes. The release rate and skin flux of topical drug application were adjusted by changing the type of nanocarrier, the soybean oil O/W systems showing the highest skin permeation. This formulation increased ALA flux via porcine skin to 180 nmol/cm 2 /h, which was 2. 6 -fold that of the aqueous control.

40|$|Abstract Background Sperm immobilizing {{activity}} and plausible {{mechanism of action}} of Chenopodium album seed decoction (CAD) have been elucidated in our earlier studies. The present study {{has been carried out}} to explore the safety standards of CAD along with microbicidal properties as prerequisite for its use as a topically applicable vaginal contraceptive. Methods The safety standards of CAD were assessed by a) Hemolytic index determination using rabbit erythrocytes, to set the doses of the other experiments, b) Dermal irritancy test using refined version of Draize scoring system on rabbits, c) Possible effect on local tissues and reproductive performance in female rats after fourteen daily single dose application, d) PCNA staining- to evaluate the effect of CAD on vaginal tissue proliferation, e) TUNEL assay- to examine its ability to induce in situ apoptosis in the vaginal tissue sections of the treated animals, and f) Microbicidal activity- to explore the effect of CAD on the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Candida albicans. Results In vitro irritation studies on rabbit erythrocytes revealed the hemolytic index of CAD to be 8. 2 mg/ml. The <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation</b> <b>test</b> showed it to be a non-irritant even at higher doses. Intra vaginal application of CAD in rat vagina for 14 consecutive days caused slight reversible inflammation on vaginal epithelial cells at doses as high as 82 mg/ml. However, at this dose level it neither had any adverse effect on vaginal tissue proliferation nor did it cause in situ apoptosis as evident from PCNA staining and TUNEL assay. Fertility and fecundity were restored 4 - 15 days after withdrawal of CAD application. At dose level 10 times that of its spermicidal MEC (minimum effective concentration), CAD did not block the growth of Lactobacillus, although the size of individual colony was marginally reduced. However, growth of the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans was completely inhibited with 20 mg/ml of CAD. Conclusion The overall result evolved from the study strengthens the candidature of CAD as a safe microbicidal spermicide. It is almost non-irritant to rabbit skin and rat vaginal tissues at doses 10 fold higher than its hemolytic index. The effect of CAD on Lactobacillus culture was not highly encouraging but it prevented the growth of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans at 20 mg/ml of CAD. </p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{reports the}} {{development}} and characterization of a nanoemulsion (NE) able to improve the cutaneous penetration of nifedipine. NE with nifedipine was development and characterized, presenting droplet size of 20 nm with low polydispersity index (IP< 0. 1), spherical shape without aggregation, pH compatible with typical skin levels and stability evaluated by seven months. In the permeation studies, a classical formulation based in an oil/water cream containing nifedipine was used for comparison with NE. Nanoemulsion promoted and improved the retention of nifedipine in the epidermis and dermis in relation to classical formulation. This promoting effect {{is related to the}} nanometric size of the droplets of the NE (20 nm), which give him a large superficial area, favoring the contact of the nanocarrier with the skin surface. The NE was efficient in promoting accumulation of nifedipine in the dermis, which is the site of vasodilation action. NE was not irritating according to the primary <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation</b> <b>tests.</b> NE is a promising release system to promote cutaneous penetration of nifedipine and can be used in the future in clinical trials to promote healing of lesions caused by peripheral vascular diseases...|$|R

40|$|O tratamento de feridas cutÃneas crÃnicas resulta em altos custos e riscos de complicaÃÃes que podem atrasar a resoluÃÃo do processo de cicatrizaÃÃo. Neste estudo, uma formulaÃÃo farmacÃutica (pomada) foi desenvolvida contendo uma fraÃÃo proteica isolada do lÃtex de Himatanthus drasticus (HdLP) com o objetivo de {{investigar}} o seu efeito no processo de cicatrizaÃÃo de feridas excisionais em camundongos swiss machos (25 Â 3, 0 g). Primeiramente, o teste de irritabilidade dermal em camundongos demonstrou que o tratamento tÃpico com a pomada contendo HdLP nÃo foi capaz de provocar reaÃÃes de irritaÃÃo na pele Ãntegra e na pele escarificada. A anÃlise macroscÃpica de feridas excisionais constatou que HdLP 0, 5 %, 1, 0 % e 2, 0 % nÃo interferiu nos sinais flogÃsticos de edema e hiperemia, mas o tratamento com HdLP 2, 0 % acelerou a contraÃÃo das Ãlceras a partir do 9 Â dia apÃs a induÃÃo cirÃrgica da lesÃo, antecipou o surgimento do tecido cicatricial e favoreceu a reepitelizaÃÃo completa das feridas. ApÃs a anÃlise macroscÃpica, a concentraÃÃo de HdLP 2, 0 % foi escolhida para o estudo histopatolÃgico (infiltrado leucocitÃrio, degranulaÃÃo de mastÃcitos, fibroplasia e colagÃnese) e de mediadores inflamatÃrios (mieloperoxidase (MPO), nÃveis de nitrito e citocinas prÃ- e anti-inflamatÃrias (TNF-&# 945;, IL- 1 &# 946;, IL- 6 e IL- 10). O tratamento com HdLP 2, 0 % foi capaz de diminuir o infiltrado polimorfonuclear e aumentar o mononuclear no 2 Â dia mas nÃo interferiu no processo de degranulaÃÃo de mastÃcitos em nenhum perÃodo observado 2 Â, 7 Â e 9 Â dias. Na fase inflamatÃria, HdLP 2, 0 % diminuiu a atividade de MPO, corroborando com a reduÃÃo da migraÃÃo de polimorfonucleares, e estimulou a liberaÃÃo de IL- 1 &# 946; e IL- 10 no 2 Â dia, alÃm disso, os nÃveis de nitrito foram reduzidos no 2 Â e 4 Â dias e elevados no 9 Â dia. Durante a fase proliferativa, HdLP 2, 0 % estimulou a fibroplasia no 7 Â e 9 Â dias apÃs a cirurgia, o que possivelmente contribuiu para uma maior deposiÃÃo de colÃgeno observada no 9 Â e 14 Â dia. Conforme a anÃlise macroscÃpica previamente descrita, HdLP 2, 0 % favoreceu o processo de reepitelizaÃÃo das feridas excisionais mas nÃo interferiu na espessura do novo epitÃlio formado. Dessa forma, o conjunto dos resultados apresentados demonstram que o tratamento tÃpico com HdLP 2, 0 % modula a resposta inflamatÃria da cicatrizaÃÃo, influenciando nas etapas posteriores e acelerando a reparaÃÃo tecidual de feridas cutÃneas excisionais experimentais. The {{treatment of}} chronic skin wounds results in high costs and risks of complications that could delay {{the resolution of}} the healing process. In this study, a pharmaceutical formulation (ointment) was developed containing an isolated protein fraction from Himatanthus drasticus latex (HdLP) in order to investigate its effect on the excisional wound healing in swiss mice (25 Â 3, 0 g). Inicially, the <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation</b> <b>test</b> in mice demonstrated that topical treatment with the ointment containing HdLP was not able to cause reactions of irritation in intact skin and the damaged skinreactions. The macroscopic analysis showed that HdLP 0, 5 %, 1, 0 % and 2, 0 % did not affect the inflammatory signs of edema and hyperemia in excisional wounds but treatment with 2, 0 % HdLP accelerated contraction of ulcers from 9 th day after surgical induction of injury, anticipated the appearance of scar tissue and favored a complete re-epithelialization of wounds. After macroscopic analysis, the concentration of HdLP 2, 0 % was chosen for the histopathological study (leukocyte infiltration, mast cell degranulation, fibroplasia and collagenesis) and inflammatory mediators (myeloperoxidase (MPO), levels of nitrite and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&# 945;, IL- 1 &# 946;, IL- 6 and IL- 10). The treatment with HdLP 2, 0 % was able to decrease the polymorphonuclear infiltrate and increase the mononuclear on the 2 nd day but had no effect on mast cell degranulation process in any period observed 2, 7 and 9 days. In the inflammatory phase, HdLP 2, 0 % decreased the MPO activity, confirming the reduction of migration of polymorphonuclear cells, and stimulated release of IL- 1 &# 946; and IL- 10 on day 2, moreover, the nitrite levels were reduced at 2 and 4 days and exalted on the 9 th day. During the proliferative phase, HdLP 2, 0 % stimulated fibroplasia at 7 and 9 days after surgery, which probably contributed to increased collagen deposition observed in the 9 th and 14 th day. As the macroscopic analysis previously described, HdLP 2, 0 % favored the re-epithelialization process of excisional wounds but did not affect the thickness of newly formed epithelium. Therefore, all the results presented show that topical treatment with HdLP 2, 0 % modulates the inflammatory response of wound healing, influencing the subsequent phases and speeding up the tissue repair of experimental wounds excised...|$|E

5000|$|The {{flowers are}} purple and grouped in {{globular}} capitula, united in clusters. They appear in mid-summer, from July to September. [...] The capitula {{are surrounded by}} an involucre made out of many bracts, each curving to form a hook, allowing them to be carried long distances on the fur of animals. The fruits are achenes; they are long, compressed, with short pappus hairs. These are a potential hazard for humans, horses, and dogs. The minute, sharply-pointed, bristly pappus hairs easily detach {{from the top of}} the achenes and are carried by the slightest breeze - attaching to skin, mucous membranes, and eyes where they can cause severe <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation,</b> possible respiratory manifestations, and ophthalmia. [...] The fleshy tap-root can grow up to 1 m deep.|$|R
40|$|Inflammation is {{the human}} body's {{response}} to a tissue damage as indicated by an increase of vascular permeability. One of the natural substances {{that can be used}} to treat inflammation is clove oil (MABC). This study aimed to evaluate the physical properties and MABC emulgel <b>irritation</b> <b>test</b> (Syzygium aromaticum). This experimental study was initiated by the emulgel formulation with three kinds of formula, with each formula contains MABC levels of 10 % (F 1), 12. 5 % (F 2), and 15 % (F 3). The physical tests for emulgel was done including pH, spreading test and adhesive <b>test</b> and <b>irritation</b> <b>test</b> in guinea pigs using Draize test method. Statistical analysis by t test with a level of confidence 95 % was conducted to detect a significant differences between the treatment groups. The emulgel formula with a concentration of 10 %, 12. 5 % and 15 % were physically stable, moreover the dispersive power test for each formula showed normal distribution data (p> 0. 05) and homogeneous (p> 0. 05), ANOVA test results obtained significantly different results in each formula (p< 0. 05), whereas the stickiness test results for each formula more than 30 minutes with pH 6. The results of <b>irritation</b> <b>test</b> by using Draize test method, indicated that each formula did not show any irritant effect...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of eye and skin irritation potential {{is essential to}} ensuring the safety of human in contact {{with a wide variety}} of substances. Despite this importance of <b>irritation</b> <b>test,</b> little is known with respect to the irritation potency of lomefloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, which has been known to cause photo-toxicity with an abnormal reaction of the skin. Thus, to investigate the tendency of lomefloxacin to cause eye and skin irritation, we carried out in vitro eye <b>irritation</b> <b>test</b> using Balb/c 3 T 3, and in vitro skin irrita-tion test using KeraSkin TM human skin model system. 3 T 3 neutral red uptake assay has been proposed as a potential replacement alternative for the Draize Eye <b>irritation</b> <b>test.</b> In this study, the IC 50 value obtained for lomefloxacin was 375 µg. According to the classification model used for determining in vitro categories, lomefloxacin was classified as moderately irritant. For {{evaluation of}} skin irritation, engineered epidermal equivalents (KeraSkin TM) were subjected to 10 and 25 mg of lomefloxacin for 15 minutes. Tissue damage was assessed by tissue viability evaluation, and by the release of a pro-inflammatory mediator, interleukin- 1 α. Lomefloxacin increased the interleukin- 1 α release after 15 minutes of exposure and 42 hours of post incubation, although no decrease in viability was observed. Therefore, lomefloxacin is considered to be moderately irritant to skin and eye...|$|R

30|$|Periodically, the EPA {{issues a}} report {{covering}} glyphosate exposure and health-impact incident reports. For example, between 2002 and 2008, {{a total of}} 271 incident reports were compiled by EPA, 36 % of which involved neurological symptoms, 29.5 % <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation,</b> rash, or hives, and 14 % respiratory duress [15]. Common causes of such incidents include a slow leak in a hose or fitting on a backpack sprayer, leading to the drenching over several hours of the applicator’s neck, back, and/or legs; repair of an equipment breakdown that inadvertently leads to significant exposure to spray solution; and, routine maintenance and service of spraying equipment and tank cleanup procedures. In the case of large-scale spray equipment used to apply a GBH in farm fields or large areas, a person repairing a leaky fitting or valve, or dealing with clogged nozzles or a blown hose, can be heavily exposed {{in a matter of}} seconds.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} it was {{examined}} {{how people are}} exposed to compounds contained in hygienic cleaning products used in the kitchen. The products for which exposure was assessed are dishwashing liquids, hygienic cleaning napkins, spray cleaners and bleach containing products (abrasive, all purpose cleaner and bleach). For each product type, exposure was assessed for one sample compound while performing one or two cleaning tasks in the kitchen. The exposure assessments were performed using the computer application, CONSEXPO. The calculated exposures were compared to the toxicity of the assessed compounds {{in order to assess}} risk. Exposure to didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride is concluded to be a possible cause of slight <b>dermal</b> <b>irritation</b> when using a hygienically cleaning trigger spray. On the basis of a first toxicological screening, exposure to the assessed compounds when using the products for cleaning tasks in the kitchen is not expected to cause adverse health effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} role of topical valproate (VPA) in hair regrowth {{has been}} recently suggested. However, safety reports of VPA as a topical formulation are lacking. Therefore, {{in the present}} study, we investigated whether VPA causes skin irritation in humans. We first performed a cell viability test and showed that VPA did not exhibit toxicity toward HaCaT keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and RBL- 3 H mast cells. We then performed clinical patch <b>test</b> and skin <b>irritation</b> <b>test</b> through transdermal drug delivery {{with the help of}} microneedle rollers. No significant findings were obtained in the clinical patch test. In the skin <b>irritation</b> <b>test,</b> only 1 patient showed erythema at 1 hr, but the irritation reaction faded away within a few hours. Erythema and edema were not observed at 24 hr. We concluded that VPA has minimal potential to elicit skin irritation. Therefore, we consider that VPA can safely be applied to human skin. Key words: Valproate, Skin toxicit...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{attraction}} effect against Lycorma delicatula and antioxidant activity of hexane, chloroform, butanol and water fraction obtained from Ailanthus altissima methanol extract. The attraction effect of chloroform fraction showed the highest activity (47 %) as {{compared to that of}} other fractions. In the DPPH radical scavenging activity, methanol and butanol fraction showed higher antioxidant activity than other solvent fractions. From the above results, the potential chloroform fraction was further performed by local <b>irritation</b> <b>test</b> in New Zealand white rabbits. In eye <b>irritation</b> <b>test,</b> chloroform fraction showed moderate irritant at high concentration 0. 5 g/site/mL, but there was no eye irritation at low concentration (0. 05 g/site/mL). In accordance with the Draize evaluation of skin irritation, the primary irritation index was calculated to 3. 3 and 0. 68 at high (0. 5 g/site/mL) and low concentration (0. 05 g/site/ mL) causing moderate and mild irritation, respectively. On the basis of this study, Ailanthus altissima chloroform fractio...|$|R
40|$|The 21 -day {{cumulative}} <b>irritation</b> <b>test</b> {{for assessing}} the irritancy of topical products and chemicals is a venerable procedure {{that appears to have}} become the gold standard for manufacturers. Berger and Bowman in 1982 (1) showed that reducing the exposure to 14 days was less traumatic to the volunteers, less costly, less arduous, and did not affect reliability or the capacity to place the test agents in the proper rank order of irritancy. In the current study we compared (a) the 21 -day cumulative <b>irritation</b> <b>test,</b> (b) the 14 -day cumulative <b>irritation</b> <b>test,</b> and (c) the 14 -day test with every-other-day patching. Additionally, ten-day, seven-day and four-day data from the 21 -day test were compared. Forty-one subjects completed this study of six test materials. Two sets of patches were applied to each subject's lower back. One set had 21 consecutive applications of the test articles. The second set was applied, and removal of the test articles occurred Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 14 days. The 21 -day test fully differentiated the test materials from each other. Using only the first 14 days of the 21 -day test also fully differentiated the test materials. Every-other-day patching rank ordered the test materials the same as the everyday patching, but full differentiation of the test materials was not obtained. We conclude that the 14 -day cumulative irritancy test is as reliable and sensitive as the 21 -day test, along with the obvious advantages in time, cost, and minimization of trauma to the test subjects...|$|R
