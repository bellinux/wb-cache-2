5|$|In August, twelve <b>engineers</b> <b>were</b> hired on {{contract}} with Baneservice, {{at the time}} a subsidiary of the Norwegian National Rail Administration. The <b>engineers</b> <b>were</b> subsequently re-certified for the Y1 class, as well as being given a service course. While other engineers in the country are required to take an 18-month course, Timetoget felt it could meet sufficient safety standards with a six-week course. Arne Wam, chief executive officer of NSB, stated that he could not permit that a subsidiary ignore safety in such a way, and announced he would stop operations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seven}} weeks that {{followed}} the occupation of Arlington {{and the beginning of}} work on Fort Corcoran, Barnard and his <b>engineers</b> <b>were</b> forced to focus virtually all of their effort on Corcoran and Runyon, owing to the limited resources available. By the time Barnard was beginning to focus his efforts on tying Corcoran and Runyon into an entire belt of fortifications, his <b>engineers</b> <b>were</b> drawn off by the approach of the Confederate Army and the incipient First Battle of Bull Run.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seven}} weeks that {{followed}} the occupation of Arlington {{and the beginning of}} work on Fort Runyon, Barnard and his <b>engineers</b> <b>were</b> forced to focus virtually all of their effort on Corcoran, Runyon, Albany, and a few other minor batteries owing to the limited resources available. By the time Barnard was beginning to focus his efforts on tying the two forts into an entire interlocking system of fortifications, his <b>engineers</b> <b>were</b> drawn off by the approach of the Confederate Army and the incipient Battle of Bull Run.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} almost-collisions in 2005 in similar {{circumstances}} {{in the tunnel}} between Foggy Bottom and Rosslyn stations led to a new test procedure which would have identified the faulty circuit after installation. However, by 2009, Metro <b>engineers</b> <b>were</b> unaware of this incident or the tests developed to detect the failure condition.|$|E
5|$|Approaches to {{the exits}} were also cleared, with minefields lifted and holes blown in the {{embankment}} {{to permit the}} passage of vehicles. As the tide receded, <b>engineers</b> <b>were</b> also able to resume their work of clearing the beach obstacles, {{and by the end}} of the evening, 13 gaps were opened and marked.|$|E
5|$|In October 1942, Major John H. Dudley of the Manhattan Engineer District (the {{military}} {{component of the}} Manhattan Project) surveyed sites around Gallup, Las Vegas, La Ventana, Jemez Springs, and Otowi, and recommended the one near Jemez Springs. On 16 November, Oppenheimer, Groves, Dudley and others toured the site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel claustrophobic, while the <b>engineers</b> <b>were</b> concerned {{with the possibility of}} flooding. The party then moved on to the Otowi site, the vicinity of the Los Alamos Ranch School. Oppenheimer was impressed and expressed a strong preference for the site, citing its natural beauty and views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which, he hoped, would inspire those who would work on the project. The <b>engineers</b> <b>were</b> concerned about the poor access road, and whether the water supply would be adequate, but otherwise felt that it was ideal.|$|E
50|$|Manufacturing <b>Engineers</b> <b>are</b> {{responsible}} for ensuring proper {{production of the}} automotive components or complete vehicles. While the development <b>engineers</b> <b>are</b> {{responsible for}} {{the function of the}} vehicle, manufacturing <b>engineers</b> <b>are</b> responsible for the safe and effective production of the vehicle. This group of engineers consist of Process Engineers, Logistic Coordinators, Tooling Engineers, Robotics Engineers, and Assembly Planners.|$|R

5|$|The 21st <b>Engineers</b> <b>were</b> {{assigned}} {{the task of}} investigating techniques for the rapid construction of air bases. As such, Johns {{was involved in the}} development of a number of new construction techniques, most notably the use of Marston Mat.|$|E
5|$|Another of Harrison's goals was {{to raise}} {{the morale of the}} {{workforce}} and locomotive engineers; crews were assigned to the same locomotives, and senior <b>engineers</b> <b>were</b> allowed to paint their names on their engines. When business declined in 1914 Harrison reduced his salary by 20percent, but introduced smaller and graduated cuts for other staff, with the smallest percentages at the lowest pay scales. Other efforts to improve morale included rewards for fuel efficiency and the improvement of safety, including stricter investigation of accidents.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, the Governor of British East Africa {{requested}} {{assistance to}} deal with the German forces in German East Africa and the problem was handed to the India Office, which assembled two forces and shipped them to his aid. Indian Expeditionary Force B consisted of the 27th (Bangalore) Brigade from the 9th (Secunderabad) Division and an Imperial Service Infantry Brigade, a pioneer battalion, a mountain artillery battery and <b>engineers</b> <b>were</b> sent to Tanganyika with the task of invading German East Africa.|$|E
5|$|In November of that year, Prost had {{a meeting}} with the head of Honda's R {{department}} and F1 racing program, Nobuhiko Kawamoto in Geneva. He expressed his feelings that Honda was giving Senna preferential treatment, and Kawamoto then confirmed Prost's fears, explaining that the Honda <b>engineers</b> <b>were</b> of a new generation, and that they liked Senna's panache and samurai-like driving. Kawamoto was able to convince Prost that he would work something out on the Honda end of the McLaren-Honda partnership for the 1989 season, but this was not to be.|$|E
5|$|On 12 February 2003, Dechaineux was {{operating}} near her maximum safe diving depth {{off the coast}} of Western Australia when a seawater hose burst. The high-pressure seawater flooded the lower engine room before the hose was sealed off: it was estimated that if the inflow had continued for another twenty seconds, the weight of the water would have prevented Dechaineux from returning to the surface. The RAN recalled the Collins-class submarines to base after the incident; after <b>engineers</b> <b>were</b> unable to determine any flaws in the pipes that could have caused the incident, the maximum safe diving depth of the class was reduced.|$|E

5|$|The Anglesey Central Railway Act 1863 (26 & 27 Vict. c.cxxviii) {{founded the}} company, with capital of Â£120,000. The {{chairman}} was William Bulkeley Hughes, MP for Caernarfon and local railway prospector. The ceremonial first sod was cut on 11 September 1863, with construction starting {{the following year}} by the contractors Dickson and Russell. With the line approaching Llangefni later in October 1864, LNWR <b>engineers</b> <b>were</b> authorised to build the main line junction at Gaerwen, at the Anglesey Central Railway's expense.|$|E
5|$|The United States Military Academy (USMA) is an {{undergraduate}} college in West Point, New York that educates and commissions officers for the United States Army. This list {{is drawn from}} alumni of the Military Academy who are engineers. Most of the U.S. Army's Chiefs of <b>Engineers</b> <b>were</b> Academy alumni; beginning with Joseph Gardner Swift (class of 1802) and most recently the current Chief of Engineers, Robert L. Van Antwerp, Jr. (class of 1972). Other notable engineers include Orlando Metcalfe Poe (class of 1856), a lighthouse engineer, and George Washington Goethals (class of 1880), chief engineer of the Panama Canal.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{locating}} Project Y at Oak Ridge was considered, {{but in the}} end it {{was decided}} that it should be in a remote location. On Oppenheimer's recommendation, the search for a suitable site was narrowed to the vicinity of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Oppenheimer owned a ranch. In October 1942, Major John H. Dudley of the Manhattan Project was sent to survey the area, and he recommended a site near Jemez Springs, New Mexico. On 16 November, Oppenheimer, Groves, Dudley and others toured the site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel claustrophobic, while the <b>engineers</b> <b>were</b> concerned with the possibility of flooding.

Cimolai S.p.A. from Italy fabricated and erected the 72 steel plane frames for the stands and all the 4,500 components of the roof.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-one {{companies}} were eventually formed and were employed digging subways, cable trenches, Sapping, dugouts {{as well as}} offensive or defensive mining. At {{the end of the}} war, <b>Engineers</b> <b>were</b> directly responsible for maintaining buildings and designing the infantry front-line fortifications and artillery positions, the telephones, wireless and other signalling equipment, railways, roads, water supply, bridges and transport. They also operated the railways and inland waterways.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, episode 1 of The Mind of Evil {{contains}} no colour information. In principle, BBC <b>engineers</b> <b>were</b> supposed {{to filter out}} the chroma dots upon telerecording, to create a cleaner and nicer picture. In most cases they {{failed to do so}} properly, allowing the colour recovery process to work. For this one episode, the filter had been correctly applied â€“ so there was no colour to recover. To complete the serial for DVD, the episode was manually colourised by Stuart Humphryes and Peter Crocker â€“ thereby returning the final Pertwee episode to its original colour presentation.|$|E
