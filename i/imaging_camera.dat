25|$|Coronary {{catheterization}} {{is performed}} in a catheterization lab, usually located within a hospital.

The X-ray source and <b>imaging</b> <b>camera</b> equipment are {{on opposite sides of}} the patient's chest and freely move, under motorized control, around the patient's chest so images can be taken quickly from multiple angles. More advanced equipment, termed a bi-plane cath lab, uses two sets of X-ray source and imaging cameras, each free to move independently, which allows two sets of images to be taken with each injection of radiocontrast agent. The equipment and installation setup to perform such testing typically represents a capital expenditure of US$2–5 million (2004), sometimes more, partially repeated every few years.|$|E
