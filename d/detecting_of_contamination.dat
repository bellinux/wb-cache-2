Natural perchlorate on Earth was first identified in terrestrial nitrate deposits of the Atacama Desert in Chile as early as in the 1880s {{and for a long time}} considered a unique perchlorate source. The perchlorate released from the historic use of Chilean nitrate based fertilizer which were imported to the U.S. by the hundreds of tons in the early 19th century can still be found in some groundwater sources of the United States. Recent improvements in analytical sensitivity using ion chromatography based techniques have revealed a more widespread presence of natural perchlorate, particularly in subsoils of Southwest USA, salt evaporites in California and Nevada, Pleistocene groundwater in New Mexico, and even present in extremely remote places such as Antarctica. The data from these studies and others indicate that natural perchlorate is globally deposited on Earth with the subsequent accumulation and transport governed by the local hydrologic conditions.|$|R

This study was undertaken {{to investigate whether}} adopting a different skin disinfection protocol could reduce the rate <b>of</b> bacterial <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> platelet concentrates. Materials and Methods: Two skin disinfection protocols were consecutively used in the routine blood collection setting during two 10 -month periods: 0. 5 % cetrimide/ 0. 05 % chlorhexidine solution followed by 70 % isopropyl alcohol (first 10 -month time-period); and 10 % povidone-iodine followed by 70 % isopropyl alcohol (second 10 -month time-period). The rates <b>of</b> bacterial <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> platelet concentrates were monitored by using a surveillance programme described previously. Results: The overall bacterial contamination rate in the first time-period was 0. 072 %. After introduction of the povidone-iodine and isopropyl alcohol protocol, the bacterial contamination rate decreased to 0. 042 % (relative risk reduction: - 0. 42; 95 % confidence interval, - 0. 12 to - 0. 61, P = 0. 009). There were no differences {{in the types of}} micro-organisms identified (P = 0. 7). Conclusions: Skin disinfection by povidone-iodine and isopropyl alcohol is more effective than that by cetrimide/chorhexidine and isopropyl alcohol in reducing venepuncture-associated <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> platelet concentrates by skin flora.
