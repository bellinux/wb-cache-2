25|$|In 1964 a {{by-election}} set {{the model}} for future NDP campaigns. Under the campaign management of Gerald Caplan, Stephen Lewis, and Marjorie Pinney the NDP canvassed every household three times, identified all their supporters, and then they <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> vote. This strategy {{is also known as}} PIG, Persuade, Identify, Get out the vote. Lawyer Jim Renwick won with 7,287 votes compared to 5,774 votes for the Conservatives and 5,771 votes for the Liberals.|$|E
25|$|England won the toss and batted first, {{but lost}} both openers to Boyd Rankin in six overs, before Ian Bell spent 74 balls making his 31. When Bell <b>got</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> run rate was {{slightly}} above 4; {{in the final}} 28 overs it was in excess of 6, with Paul Collingwood making 90, Kevin Pietersen 48 and Andrew Flintoff 43. Kyle McCallan was the most economical bowler for Ireland, and also took the wicket of Pietersen.|$|E
25|$|The third ODI proved another {{disappointment}} for Godleman as he {{once again}} {{made it to the}} high 20s and once again <b>got</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> fourth match proved to be his day however as he became the highest U19 run scorer for England in ODIs, passing names such as: Michael Vaughan, Alastair Cook, Nick Knight and Marcus Trescothick. He faced exactly half the balls in the innings (150 balls) and scored 149 not out, as Adam Lyth and himself took England to a massive score of 313–7.|$|E

25|$|Josiah Dann, a tramcar conductor, {{was summoned}} on 2 August 1883 for having carried 28 {{passengers}} {{when the car}} was only licensed for 24. The officer noticed the tramcar in Carrington Street drawn by one horse and counted the passengers. When the car reached the ascent at the Canal Bridge, the horse had to stop {{and some of the}} passengers <b>got</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> conductor pleaded guilty but in mitigation said that the passengers were all going to the Nottinghamshire v. Gloucestershire cricket match at Trent Bridge. He was fined 20s.|$|E
25|$|The {{third day}} belonged to Sri Lanka once more, with Silva {{reaching}} 152 not {{out by the}} end of the innings, and Chaminda Vaas chipping in with a well made 47. Needing an unlikely 504 runs to win the match, New Zealand lost their openers with just 60 runs scored. On the fourth and final day, the New Zealanders lost five quick wickets falling to 163 for 7, before Vettori and Franklin shared a partnership of 96. After Vettori <b>got</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand team lost their way and finished with 286. Sri Lanka won by 217 runs to level the test series 1-1. The player of the match was Chamara Silva after scoring 213 runs in the match.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{were put}} in to bat by Brian Lara as the ball moved about and {{deviated}} off the seam in the early overs. Daren Powell got the wicket of Adam Gilchrist with an inside edge, while Matthew Hayden could not score off his first 17 deliveries – then made 158 runs from the next 126 to make the highest innings for Australia in a World Cup match. However, Ricky Ponting and Hayden scored at above six an over in their partnership, before Ponting was eventually run out. Hayden added 98 for the third wicket with Michael Clarke before Dwayne Bravo broke through, and Andrew Symonds and Michael Hussey could not provide more than 15 runs to the team cause. Hussey <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> total at 234 for five in the 41st over, but Hayden eventually led Australia to break loose in the last 10 overs, taking 99 from them despite a 20-minute break for rain. Shane Watson's 33 from 26 balls also helped push Australia to 322 for 6 after the full 50 overs. This was the sixth successive score above 300 for Australia, a new One-day International record.|$|E

500|$|Bowling {{primarily}} from over the wicket, his accuracy, changes of pace, and movement in both directions, {{coupled with a}} leg stump line to a packed leg-side field, made scoring off him difficult. He achieved his success in a manner not dissimilar to Derek Underwood a generation later. His accuracy and stamina allowed Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller, one of Australia's finest fast bowling pairs of all time, to draw breath between short and incisive bursts of pace and swing. Standing , he was particularly effective on sticky wickets, reducing his speed to slow medium pace and using a repertoire of off cutters, inswingers, outswingers and leg breaks. Bowling a leg-stump line from over the wicket with a leg side cordon of two short legs and a silly mid-on, he was described by Bradman as [...] "unique in every way". Bradman further added [...] "I cannot remember another of the same type...He worried and <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> best bats, was amazingly accurate and must have turned in fine figures had not his cartilage given way." [...] He usually bowled with four men on the off side including a slip, and five on the leg. When the pitch was wet, he moved a further man to the on side to field at leg slip.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the first}} day [...] Shaminda Eranga got his first wicket in tests with his first ball (repeating Nathan Lyon's feat in the 1st test); his victim was Shane Watson. Also on {{the first day}} Shaun Marsh {{achieved}} an average of 222 before he <b>got</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> highest ever by an Australian. Michael Hussey was Man of the Match for all three test matches and was awarded Man of the Series.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{successful}} reading with the actress Jean Fennell (who was originally cast as Angie), {{he was offered}} the part. However, shortly afterwards Grantham contacted Smith and asked {{to speak to her}} urgently. He revealed that he had been found guilty of killing a German taxi driver while on army service in 1967, and spent 10 years in prison. Although there were fears that if this story <b>got</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> resultant publicity would do enormous damage to the programme and the BBC, Smith decided not to withdraw Grantham from the role. In her opinion, he had paid the full penalty that society requires for a mistake committed in his past and it was a [...] "Christian duty to forgive".|$|E

2500|$|Mel Blanc – several characters' voices, {{including}} the railroad station announcer who said, [...] "Train leaving on track five for Anaheim, Azusa and Cu... camonga!". This gag became well known, {{and was used}} in several Bugs Bunny cartoons which Mel Blanc also voiced. It eventually led to a statue of Benny in Cucamonga. Blanc was also featured with Benny as a Mexican character in the classic Si-Sy routine, and on radio {{as the sound of}} Benny's Maxwell automobile. He also provided the growling voice of Carmichael, Benny's pet polar bear, and later the squawking voice of Polly, Benny's pet parrot. Blanc is perhaps best remembered as Professor LeBlanc, Benny's perpetually frustrated violin teacher, [...] who was as likely to assault his student out of insane exasperation as he was to jump out the window before he <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|E
60|$|When {{the stage}} stopped, Stuyvesant {{and all the}} other {{passengers}} <b>got</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> stage was standing near a platform which extended along the side of one of the buildings of the station.
