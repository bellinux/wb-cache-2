2500|$|Josh Brolin as George W. Bush: Stone's {{original}} {{idea for the}} main role was to propose it to Harrison Ford, who he said had [...] "a pretty similar face as of George Bush".

[...] Brolin, cast at the [...] "last minute", spent months working on Bush's distinctive vocal style, calling hotels in Texas and talking to the people at the front desk, listening to their accents. The actor also watched videos of Bush walking. Brolin said, [...] "It changes over the years, how <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>in</b> his 30s, how <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>in</b> foreign lands, before 9/11 and afterward.

6000|$|There is good {{testimony}} that various species of Gibbon readily {{take to the}} erect posture. Mr. George Bennett, [16] a very excellent observer, in describing the habits of a male 'Hylobates syndactylus' which remained for some time in his possession, says: [...] "He invariably walks in the erect posture when on a level surface; and then the arms either hang down, enabling him to assist himself with his knuckles; or what is more usual, he keeps his arms uplifted in nearly an erect position, with the hands pendent ready to seize a rope, and climb up on the approach of danger or on the obtrusion of strangers. He walks rather quick in the erect posture, but with a waddling gait, and is soon run down if, whilst pursued, he has no opportunity of escaping by climbing.... When <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>in</b> the erect posture he turns the leg and foot outwards, which occasions {{him to have a}} waddling gait and to seem bow-legged." ...|$|E
