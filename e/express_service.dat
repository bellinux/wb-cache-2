5|$|Bergen Street was {{originally}} designed as an express station, {{but only the}} upper level is currently in service; the lower level is neither in regular service nor usable due to its deteriorated condition. The lower level of the station was used when <b>express</b> <b>service</b> was provided on the Culver Line between 1968 and 1976. <b>Express</b> <b>service</b> was eliminated due {{to the loss of}} direct local service along the line to Manhattan. The express platforms were permanently removed from service during the 1990s, and due to a fire in 1999 the relay room was damaged, making the express tracks unusable. The relay room was rebuilt in 2008, and after repairs were done on the line, the implementation of <b>express</b> <b>service</b> become feasible. In 2016, it was announced that the MTA was considering having <b>express</b> <b>service</b> brought back to the line. However, unlike the earlier <b>express</b> <b>service,</b> express trains will skip this station due to the high cost of rebuilding it, thus making the station a local stop.|$|E
5|$|The lower-level express platforms, while {{built with}} the rest of the station, were only {{operated}} between 1968 and 1976 when <b>express</b> <b>service</b> was operated along the line. They were permanently removed from service in 1992, and support facilities were added to the platforms. There are no plans to restore <b>express</b> <b>service</b> to the station, even with the proposed introduction of rush-hour F <b>express</b> <b>service</b> on the IND Culver Line in fall 2017 (see below).|$|E
5|$|There are two express {{tracks on}} the {{northern}} part of the route and one on the southern, with express stations distributed along the line. However, <b>express</b> <b>service</b> has only operated once on the line from 1968 to 1987. Restoration of <b>express</b> <b>service</b> has been thwarted by budget shortages, passenger opposition, and a serious signal fire at Bergen Street in 1999. The issue came to a head in June 2007, when a petition for <b>express</b> <b>service</b> reached 2,600 signatures and gained media attention. The Culver Line underwent repairs from 2009 until early 2013, during which the express tracks were replaced and rehabilitated which may facilitate future <b>express</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E

5|$|In May 2016, the MTA {{revealed}} {{plans to}} restore <b>express</b> <b>service</b> on the Culver Line between Jay Street and Church Avenue by Fall 2017. The Bergen Street lower level, however, {{will not be}} restored and reactivated for <b>express</b> <b>service.</b> This is {{in spite of the}} fact that the station is one of the most heavily used on the line.|$|E
5|$|On November 26, 1967, the Chrystie Street Connection {{opened and}} D trains were rerouted via the Manhattan Bridge and the BMT Brighton Line to Coney Island. F trains were {{extended}} once again via the Culver Line. From June 1968 to 1987, the Culver Line featured <b>express</b> <b>service</b> during rush hours. F trains ran express {{in both directions}} between Bergen Street and Church Avenue, while G trains were extended from Smith–Ninth Streets to Church Avenue to provide local service. <b>Express</b> <b>service</b> on the elevated portion of the line to Kings Highway operated in the peak direction (to Manhattan AM; to Brooklyn PM), with some F trains running local and some running express. <b>Express</b> <b>service</b> between Bergen and Church ended in 1976, and between Church and Kings Highway in 1987, largely due to budget constraints and complaints from passengers at local stations. <b>Express</b> <b>service</b> on the elevated Culver Line was ended due to necessary structural work, but never restored. With the end of <b>express</b> <b>service,</b> Bergen Street's lower level {{was taken out of}} service. Following renovations to the station in the 1990s, the lower level was converted into storage space and is not usable for passenger service in its current state.|$|E
5|$|On weekdays, <b>express</b> <b>service</b> to St. George is {{provided}} between 6:15a.m. and 8:15a.m. and to Tottenville from 7:01a.m. to 8:01a.m. and 4:01p.m. to 7:51p.m. Morning express trains run non-stop {{in both directions}} between New Dorp and St. George; afternoon express trains run non-stop from St. George to Great Kills southbound only. <b>Express</b> <b>service</b> is noted on trains {{by the presence of}} a red marker with the terminal and 'express' directly underneath it.|$|E
50|$|From {{the start}} of the revised {{timetable}} introduced on 25 September 2015, Semi Special <b>Express</b> <b>services</b> were also to stop at Sasazuka and Chitose-Karasuyama stations, and Semi <b>Express</b> <b>services</b> will also stop at Sengawa Station.|$|R
50|$|The Tōzai Line was {{the first}} Tokyo Metro line on which <b>express</b> <b>services</b> run: three types of rapid trains skip some {{stations}} east of Tōyōchō. The Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line began services on June 14, 2008 and also features <b>express</b> <b>services.</b>|$|R

5|$|For {{lines with}} three or four tracks with <b>express</b> <b>service,</b> local stops will have side {{platforms}} and the middle one or two tracks will not stop at the station. On these lines, express stations typically have two island platforms, one for the local and express in one direction, and another for the local and express in the other direction. Each island platform provides a cross-platform interchange between local and express services. Some lines with four-track <b>express</b> <b>service</b> have two tracks each on two levels and use both island and side platforms.|$|E
50|$|There is no limited <b>express</b> <b>services</b> at {{the station}} as the city of Takaoka is served by the Hokuriku Shinkansen at Shin-Takaoka Station. Prior {{to the opening of}} the Shinkansen in 2015, the station was served by the {{following}} limited <b>express</b> <b>services.</b>|$|R
50|$|The re-alignment of {{services}} commenced in May 2014 when First TransPennine <b>Express</b> <b>services</b> between Liverpool and Newcastle were routed through Manchester Victoria rather than Piccadilly.

5|$|The B, D, and Q trains {{were all}} rerouted from the express tracks of the BMT Broadway Line to the express tracks of the IND Sixth Avenue Line {{as part of}} Manhattan Bridge reconstruction. No more <b>express</b> <b>service</b> was to be run on the Broadway Line, since these {{services}} comprised the entirety of Broadway <b>express</b> <b>service.</b> This also eliminated the divided B and D services (the Sixth Avenue Line B/D services were separate from the Broadway Line B/D services, as the Sixth Avenue services had originated at 34th Street–Herald Square and continued to upper Manhattan and the Bronx via the IND Eighth Avenue Line and the IND Concourse Line).|$|E
5|$|The Citizen's Budget Commission {{proposed}} a one track tunnel from Queens Plaza under the East River {{in the vicinity}} of 61st Street, and would connect to the IND Sixth Avenue Line at 59st Street. This would allow additional Queens <b>Express</b> <b>service</b> in the peak direction.|$|E

5|$|Community Transit's Strategic Planning Group {{published}} a recommendation in 2004, calling for {{bus rapid transit}} service on the State Route 99 corridor between Everett Station and Aurora Village Transit Center, featuring off-board fare collection, limited stops, and transit signal priority. The route alternatives proposed included <b>express</b> <b>service</b> from Aurora Village to Downtown Seattle via Aurora Avenue North or Interstate 5, as well as <b>express</b> <b>service</b> on Interstate 5 in Everett, if a partnership to share costs with Everett Transit for the Evergreen Way segment was not viable. In December 2005, the CT Board of Directors approved an accelerated planning schedule for a bus rapid transit project, to cost an estimated $15–20 million, and to begin service as the first such system in the Puget Sound region in 2008.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of its}} history, G {{service has}} {{terminated}} at Smith–Ninth Streets, relaying using the express tracks and switches at Fourth Avenue. This occasionally caused delays to F service, and prevented <b>express</b> <b>service</b> from being operated. In 2009, the G's terminus was moved to Church Avenue in order to complete renovations on the viaduct. In July 2012, this extension was made permanent.|$|E
5|$|Like other London termini, steam trains were {{phased out}} of Victoria by the 1960s, to be {{replaced}} by suburban electric and Diesel Multiple Unit services. Despite the end of international services following the opening of the Channel Tunnel, Victoria still remains an important London station, and its underground facilities in particular suffer from overcrowding. The Gatwick <b>Express</b> <b>service</b> provides easy access between Central London and Gatwick Airport for international travellers.|$|E

5|$|On {{this section}} of the line, there is Communications-based train control (CBTC) {{equipment}} on the southbound express track between Fourth Avenue and Church Avenue, as part of the automation of the New York City Subway. The total cost is $99.6 million, with $15 million coming from the 2005–2009 capital budget (phase one) and $84.6 million from the 2010–2014 capital budget (phase two). The installation is a joint venture between Siemens and Thales Group, and is used to test the track's new signaling on R143s and R160s that are already equipped with CBTC. The estimated completion date was scheduled for March 2015; the installation is expected to be permanent. If Culver Line <b>express</b> <b>service</b> is implemented in 2017 as it was proposed, the <b>express</b> <b>service</b> would not initially use CBTC, and testing of CBTC on the express track will be limited to off-peak hours. The local tracks in this section would also get CBTC as part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program.|$|E
5|$|Whilst the Campaign for Borders Rail {{acknowledged}} that the half-hourly weekday stopping service would be useful for commuters, it questions whether {{this is the best}} use of a line, which could carry other types of traffic. The organisation had proposed a two-tier service, whereby both a half-hourly stopping train and an hourly limited <b>express</b> <b>service</b> would continue north of Gorebridge.|$|E

The additional service on the Jerome Avenue Line would make use of the third track for <b>express</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
