In 2015, Valentino announced plans to build a new flagship store on Old Bond Street.|$|E
5|$|Since their {{invention}} in 1900, reflector sights <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used as gun {{sights on}} {{all kinds of}} weapons. They were used on fighter aircraft, in a limited capacity in World War I, widely used in World War II, and still used as the base component in many types of modern head-up displays. They have been used in other types of (usually large) weapons as well, such as anti-aircraft gun sights, anti tank gun sights, and any other role where the operator had to engage fast moving targets over a wide field of view, and the sight itself could be supplied with sufficient electrical power to function. There was some limited use of the sight on small arms after World War II but it came into widespread use after the late 1970s with the invention of the red dot sight, with a red light-emitting diode (LED) as its reticle, making a dependable sight with durability and extremely long illumination run time.|$|E

25|$|One {{surviving}} {{group of}} stories suggests how Hecate might <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{incorporated into the}} Greek pantheon without affecting the privileged position of Artemis. Here, Hecate is a mortal priestess often associated with Iphigeneia. She scorns and insults Artemis, who in retribution eventually brings about the mortal's suicide. There was an area sacred to Hecate in the precincts of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, where the priests, megabyzi, officiated.|$|E
25|$|The hummocky {{deposits}} on Augustine's lower flanks resemble both topographically and lithologically {{those of}} the great landslide or debris avalanche that initiated the spectacular May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.

25|$|Both tribes {{traditionally}} spoke dialects of the Lushootseed language, {{a branch}} of the Salishan family.

25|$|The Great Depression did not {{strongly}} affect Japan. The Japanese economy shrank by 8% during 1929–31. Japan's Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo was {{the first}} to implement what <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> identified as Keynesian economic policies: first, by large fiscal stimulus involving deficit spending; and second, by devaluing the currency. Takahashi used the Bank of Japan to sterilize the deficit spending and minimize resulting inflationary pressures. Econometric studies have identified the fiscal stimulus as especially effective.|$|E

25|$|The Victorian {{era of the}} United Kingdom was {{the period}} of Queen Victoria's reign from June 1837 to January 1901. This was {{a long period of}} {{prosperity}} for the British people, as profits gained from the overseas British Empire, as well as from industrial improvements at home, allowed a large, educated middle class to develop. Some scholars would extend the beginning of the period—as defined by a variety of sensibilities and political games that <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated with the Victorians—back five years to the passage of the Reform Act 1832.|$|E
25|$|Individual psalms were {{originally}} hymns, {{to be used}} on various occasions and at various sacred sites; later, some were anthologised, and might have been understood within the various anthologies (e.g., ps. 123 {{as one of the}} Psalms of Ascent); finally, individual psalms might be understood within the Psalter as a whole, either narrating the life of David or providing instruction like the Torah. In later Jewish and Christian tradition, the psalms <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used as prayers, either individual or communal, as traditional expressions of religious feeling.|$|E

Leigh Hunt, as might be expected, took a more tolerant view of Medwin in Lord Byron and his Contemporaries (1828), and {{since the publication of}} Byron's letters in Thomas Moore's biography(1830/31) and Lady Blessington's Conversations(1832–33), Medwin's recollections of Byron <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen, if not always faithful in detail, as an essentially accurate portrayal.|$|E
