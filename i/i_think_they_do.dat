Both Hinn and Bonnke offered full access to their events to the documentary crew, and the documentary team followed seven cases of [...] "miracle healings" [...] from Hinn's crusade over the next year. The film's director, Antony Thomas, told CNN's Kyra Phillips {{that they did not}} find any cases where people were actually healed by Hinn. Thomas said in a New York Times interview that [...] "If I had seen miracles , I would have been happy to trumpet it... but in retrospect, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> more damage to Christianity than the most committed atheist." ...|$|E

They {{see this}} capital, sir, perhaps under more {{favourable}} circumstances than are accorded {{to most of}} my countrywomen. Our republican simplicity, Mr. Glascock, has this drawback, that away from home it subjects us somewhat to the cold shade of unobserved obscurity. That it possesses merits which much more than compensate for this trifling evil I should be the last man in Europe to deny." [...] It is to be observed that American citizens are always prone to talk of Europe. It affords the best counterpoise they know to that other term, America,--and America and the United States are of course the same. To speak of France or of England as weighing equally against their own country seems to an American to be an absurdity,--and almost an insult to himself. With Europe he can compare himself, but even this is done generally {{in the style of}} the Republican Browning when she addressed the Ancient Marbles.|$|E

And what are you here? A mere drudge, toiling and moiling early and late for your bare living and two cheap dresses a year. Think over it. [Soothingly] Youre shocked, I know.

60|$|There are {{truths that}} have almost become untrue by {{becoming}} untruthful. There are statements so often stale and insincere that one hesitates to use them, {{even when they}} stand for something more subtle. This point about curiosity is not the conventional complaint against the American interviewer. It is not the ordinary joke against the American child. And {{in the same way}} I feel the danger of it being identified with the cant about 'a young nation' if I say that it has some of the attractions, not of American childhood, but of real childhood. There is some truth in the tradition that the children of wealthy Americans tend to be too precocious and luxurious. But there is a sense in which we can really say that if the children are like adults, the adults are like children. And that sense is in the very best sense of childhood. It is something which the modern world does not understand. It is something that modern Americans do not understand, even when they possess it; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> possess it.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Greystock, {{in making}} her {{proposition}} respecting Lady Linlithgow, wrote to Lady Fawn, {{and by the}} same post Frank wrote to Lucy. But before those letters reached Fawn Court there had come that other dreadful letter from Mrs. Hittaway. The consternation caused at Fawn Court in respect to Mr. Greystock's treachery almost robbed of its importance the suggestion made as to Lord Fawn. Could it be possible that this man, who had so openly and in so manly a manner engaged himself to Lucy Morris, should now be proposing to himself a marriage with his rich cousin? Lady Fawn {{did not believe that}} it was possible. Clara had not seen those horrid things with her own eyes, and other people might be liars. But Amelia shook her head. Amelia evidently believed that all manner of iniquities were possible to man. [...] "You see, mamma, the sacrifice he was making was so very great!" [...] "But he made it!" [...] pleaded Lady Fawn. [...] "No, mamma, he said he would make it. Men do these things. It is very horrid, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> them more now than they used to. It seems to me that nobody cares now what he does, if he's not to be put into prison." [...] It was resolved between these two wise ones that nothing at the present should be said to Lucy or to any one of the family. They would wait awhile, and in the meantime they attempted,--as far as it was possible to make the attempt without express words,--to let Lucy understand that she might remain at Fawn Court if she pleased. While this was going on, Lord Fawn did come down once again, and on that occasion Lucy simply absented herself from the dinner-table and from the family circle for that evening. [...] "He's coming in, and you've got to go to prison again," [...] Nina said to her, with a kiss.|$|E
60|$|But my {{particular}} reason for mentioning {{the matter is}} this. Despite my friend's mystical remarks about the Upper Ten, he lived {{in an atmosphere of}} something that was at least the very reverse of a respect for persons. Indeed, there was something in the very crudity of his social compliment that smacked, strangely enough, of that egalitarian soil. In a vaguely aristocratic country like England, people would never dream of telling a total stranger that {{he was a member of}} the Upper Ten. For one thing, they would be afraid that he might be. Real snobbishness is never vulgar; for it is intended to please the refined. Nobody licks the boots of a duke, if only because the duke does not like his boots cleaned in that way. Nobody embraces the knees of a marquis, because it would embarrass that nobleman. And nobody tells him he is a member of the Upper Ten, because everybody is expected to know it. But there is a much more subtle kind of snobbishness pervading the atmosphere of any society trial in England. And the first thing that struck me was the total absence of that atmosphere in the trial at Oklahoma. Mr. Hamon was presumably a member of the Upper Ten, if there is such a thing. He was a member of the Senate or Upper House in the American Parliament; he was a millionaire and a pillar of the Republican party, which might be called the respectable party; he is said to have been mentioned as a possible President. And the speeches of Clara Smith's counsel, who was known by the delightfully Oklahomite title of Wild Bill McLean, were wild enough in all conscience; but they left very little of my friend's illusion that members of the Upper Ten could not be accused of crimes. Nero and Borgia were quite presentable people compared with Senator Hamon when Wild Bill McLean had done with him. But the difference was deeper, and even in a sense more delicate than this. There is a certain tone about English trials, which does at least begin with a certain scepticism about people prominent in public life being abominable in private life. People do vaguely doubt the criminality of 'a man in that position'; that is, the position of the Marquise de Brinvilliers or the Marquis de Sade. Prima facie, it would be an advantage to the Marquis de Sade that he was a marquis. But it was certainly against Hamon that he was a millionaire. Wild Bill did not minimise him as a bankrupt or an adventurer; he insisted on the solidity and size of his fortune, he made mountains out of the 'Hamon millions,' as if they made the matter much worse; as indeed <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> But that is because I happen to share a certain political philosophy with Wild Bill and other wild buffaloes of the prairies. In other words, there is really present here a democratic instinct against the domination of wealth. It does not prevent wealth from dominating; but it does prevent the domination from being regarded with any affection or loyalty. Despite the man in the starry coat, the Americans have not really any illusions about the Upper Ten. McLean was appealing to an implicit public opinion when he pelted the Senator with his gold.|$|E

5000|$|Caroline Siede of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B+.

The showrunners clearly think the Man Of Steel looms large over viewers’ expectations of the series, but I’m not actually sure that’s the case. Had the show simply mentioned Superman in the pilot and then moved on I don’t think viewers would have been particularly upset (outside of the usual “Why isn’t the hero from one city helping the hero in another?” complaints that get lodged against every connected universe). But Supergirl clearly wants {{to clear the air}} when it comes to Superman, and all things considered <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> that fairly well.

5000|$|On 1 June Fairfax was {{prepared}} to take the city by storm if necessary. On 3 June Oxford forces made a sally from East Port, and about 100 horse troops attempted drive in some cattle grazing near Cowley, but the Parliamentarian horse troops countered them in skirmishes, during which Captain Richardson and two more were killed. On 4 June the commissioners met again in Marston to consider the new articles offered by Fairfax. On 8 June various Oxford gentlemen delivered a paper of particulars to the Privy Council, which they wanted to add into the Treaty, asking to be informed of the proceedings and to be allowed attendance with the commissioners. On 9 June the commissioners were sworn to secrecy over the talks and forbidden {{to say anything about}} their proceedings. On 10 June Fairfax sent a present of [...] "a brace of Bucks, 2 Muttons, 2 Veals, 2 Lambs, 6 Capons, and Butter" [...] into Oxford for the Duke of York (James II). A letter from Fairfax to his father, dated 13 June, states: Our Treaty doth still continue. All things are agreed upon concerning the soldiers, and they are satisfied with it. The article that took up the greatest debate was about composition. We have accepted of two years' revenue; so that is concluded to. We think Monday will conclude all the rest. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> really desire to conclude with us. On 17 June there was a general cessation of arms and extensive fraternizing between the two armies. The Privy Council did not dare meet in the Audit House as was usual [...] "in regard of the mutinous soldiers, especially reformadoes". The following day the clergy with others reproached the Lords of the Privy Council for the terms of the Treaty; the next day, the Lords of the Privy Council walked with swords on, fearing for their own safety. On 20 June the Articles of Surrender, including provisions for academics and citizens, were agreed upon at Water Eaton, and signed in the Audit House of Christ Church; for the first side by the Privy Council and the Governor of Oxford, and Fairfax for the other.|$|E
40|$|Some years ago, Lowell Martin {{wrote an}} article on {{cooperation}} between school and public libraries which he subtitled: "Or, Why Don't We Have Any?" It was not only eye-catching and provocative, but a very reasonable question to ask. A subtitle for this discussion of goals of children's services of public libraries might be: "Are We Sure We Have Any?" However, I would not do that because I believe that when conferees have heard all of the speakers and discussions planned, and when readers later have read all the papers, they will be convinced that, indeed, there are goals. If there were not, we could scarcely now all be so convinced {{of the importance of}} children's services that we would be gathered here, and there could not be the strong thread of agreement running through the presentations which, I predict, will be discernible. It is only in individual programs of service to children, perhaps only in the minds of individual librarians, that the question may not be satisfactorily answered. The most painful question is not whether librarianship has goals for public library service to children; it is whether or not each person responsible for providing that service has recognized, measurable, articulated goals for service. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E
40|$|The Supreme Court’s {{most recent}} {{confrontation}} with race-based affirmative action, Fisher v. University of Texas, {{did not live}} up to people’s expectations—or their fears. The Court did not explicitly change the current approach in any substantial way. It did, however, signal that it wants race-based affirmative action to be subject to real strict scrutiny, not the watered-down version featured in Grutter v. Bollinger. That is a significant signal, because under real strict scrutiny, almost all race-based affirmative action programs are likely unconstitutional. This is especially true given the conceptual framework the Court has created for such programs—the way the Court has set up the constitutional analysis. On the other hand, the Court’s conceptual framework is wildly, almost absurdly, wrong. This Article will discuss the way the Court has set up the constitutional analysis of affirmative action and why it is wrong. It will do so {{in the form of a}} list—a list of the propositions we must accept if we are to take the Court’s affirmative action jurisprudence at face value. Some of these are things that the Court has said explicitly, and others are inferences I feel it is fair to draw. Not all of them command majority support, and when they do not, I note that. Some of them, I hope, bear their absurdity on their face; for others, I offer some explanation of why <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not make sense.
