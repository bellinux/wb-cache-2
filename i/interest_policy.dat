40|$|In many organizations, {{there are}} {{numerous}} business processes that involve sensitive tasks that may encourage corruption. Conflict of <b>interest</b> <b>policies</b> are defined in an organization to deter corruption before it can happen. Existing research generally focuses on separation of duties, yet lacks attention for the underpinning conflicts of interest. Moreover, separation of duty is only one particular kind of conflicts of interest. Other kinds do exist and must be resolved as well. In this paper a novel approach is proposed to define conflict of <b>interest</b> <b>policies</b> and to facilitate their enforcement. Our work provides an expressive mechanism {{that can be applied}} {{for a wide range of}} conflicts of interest that go beyond separation of duty policies. Furthermore, we show how policies can be enforced in the context of the role-oriented access control model (ROAC), which we extend to provide a stronger basis for the enforcement of conflict of <b>interest</b> <b>policies.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our aim in {{this study}} was to examine the {{competing}} <b>interest</b> <b>policies</b> and procedures of organisations who develop and maintain patient decision aids. DESIGN: Descriptive and thematic analysis of data collected from a cross-sectional survey of patient decision aid developer's competing <b>interest</b> <b>policies</b> and disclosure forms. RESULTS: We contacted 25 organisations likely to meet the inclusion criteria. 12 eligible organisations provided data. 11 organisations did not reply and 2 declined to participate. Most patient decision aid developers recognise the need to consider the issue of competing interests. Assessment processes vary widely and, for the most part, are insufficiently robust to minimise the risk of competing interests. Only half of the 12 organisations had competing <b>interest</b> <b>policies.</b> Some considered disclosure to be sufficient, while others imposed differing levels of exclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Patient decision aid developers do not have a consistent approach to managing competing interests. Some have developed policies and procedures, while others pay no attention to the issue. As is the case for clinical practice guidelines, increasing attention will need to be given to how the competing interests of contributors of evidence-based publications may influence materials, especially if they are designed for patient use...|$|R
