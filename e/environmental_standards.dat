As a result of its commitment to high <b>environmental</b> <b>standards,</b> Copenhagen has been praised for its green economy, ranked as the top green city for the second time in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index (GGEI). In 2001 a large offshore wind farm was built just off the coast of Copenhagen at Middelgrunden. It produces about 4% of the city's energy. Years of substantial investment in sewage treatment have improved water quality in the harbour to an extent that the inner harbour can be used for swimming with facilities at a number of locations.|$|E

In 1992, a Draft Code of Conduct for Transnational Corporations was proposed at the Rio Earth Summit by the UN Centre for Transnational Corporations (UNCTC), but the Business Council for Sustainable Development (BCSD) together with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) argued successfully for self-regulation instead.|$|E
40|$|Eco-labels are {{suspected}} to serve protectionist purposes. We analyze {{the choice between}} an <b>environmental</b> <b>standard</b> and a voluntary eco-label scheme in a partial trade model with one domestic firm and one foreign firm. The <b>environmental</b> <b>standard</b> will only apply to the domestic firm, while both firms can adopt the eco-label. Pollution is production related, and domestic consumers demand products that are produced in an “environmentally friendly” way. Our results show {{that it may be}} optimal for the domestic government to introduce an eco-label and get both firms to adopt the label, instead of setting an <b>environmental</b> <b>standard.</b> However, to what extent this policy serves protectionist purposes is ambiguous. In particular, if the willingness to pay for green products is sufficient to cover the pollution abatement costs of the foreign firm, foreign firm profit will increase while domestic firm profit will decrease compared to the outcome with a domestic <b>environmental</b> <b>standard.</b> On the other hand, if the willingness to pay for green products is insufficient, the foreign firm would be better off with a domestic <b>environmental</b> <b>standard.</b> Copyright Springer 2006 eco-labels, product differentiation, trade policy, H 2, H 7, Q 2, Q 28,...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (LLM (Environmental Law and Governance)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. The {{research}} investigates {{whether the}} <b>environmental</b> performance <b>standards</b> prescribed by international financial lending institutions {{have the potential}} to regulate within the South African legislative framework. In assessing this, the <b>environmental</b> performance <b>standards</b> of three specific financial lending institutions, namely, the International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank and the Development Bank of Southern Africa are analysed. In addition, the extent to which South African framework legislation accommodates the use of the <b>environmental</b> performance <b>standards</b> is looked at with specific focus on the National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998 (NEMA) and the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Constitution). The principles and provisions underscored in NEMA are shown in this study to accommodate the application of the <b>environmental</b> performance <b>standards.</b> This is so because the <b>environmental</b> performance <b>standards</b> support the framework legislation {{to the extent that it}} gives effect to its principles by providing substantive content to the framework.

40|$|The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has {{established}} <b>environmental</b> flow <b>standards</b> in seven river systems {{through a process}} defined by the Texas Legislature in its 2007 Senate Bill 3 (SB 3). The <b>environmental</b> flow <b>standards</b> have been incorporated in the state?s water right permitting system with a priority date that corresponds to the date when the flow recommendations were received by the TCEQ. Therefore, all the <b>environmental</b> flow <b>standards</b> in the different systems are junior to the water rights previously granted in the state. This thesis first presents a comprehensive literature review of <b>environmental</b> flow <b>standards</b> and {{an explanation of the}} process that led to the implementation of <b>environmental</b> flow <b>standards</b> in Texas. Moreover, a comparative assessment regarding the structure of the <b>environmental</b> flow <b>standards</b> is presented to reveal the differences between the river systems defined by TCEQ. Additionally, this thesis presents a research study that used frequency analyses and Water Rights Analysis Package capabilities to evaluate the attainment of <b>environmental</b> flow <b>standards</b> and the impacts of the standards on unappropriated flows. This assessment revealed that none of the standards are met 100 % of the time due to the priority system that regulates surface water in the state. This system protects old water rights in the state, so <b>environmental</b> flow <b>standards</b> only affect water availability of future water rights. Because of this, this study included frequency analyses for unappropriated flows considering two scenarios for each system: (a) without including SB 3 standards and (b) including SB 3 standards.
