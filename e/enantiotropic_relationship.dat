40|$|This {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} the presentation and the comparison of five experimental methods for {{the determination of the}} solubilities of the two enantiotropically related crystallographic forms of etiracetam (racemic intermediate to the synthesis of leviteracetam, Keppra, UCB Pharma) in methanol. The five experimental methods can be divided into two sets of methods, depending on whether the method is isothermal or whether the temperature varies during the experiment. The results show that the most accurate and reliable determination of the solubility curves of the two crystallographic forms is obtained when combining the different methods. Using a single method limits the amount of information gained, does not allow for a verification of the obtained data, and can even limit the range for which solubility data can be experimentally determined. The results allow distinguishing the solubilities of the stable and the metastable forms and hence confirming the <b>enantiotropic</b> <b>relationship</b> of the two crystallographic forms. The transition temperature is determined to be equal to 30 °C, which confirms previous findings. © 2011 American Chemical Society. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Two polymorphs of the 1 : 1 fumarate salt of 1, 4 -diazabicyclo[3. 2. 2]nonane- 4 -carboxylic acid 4 -bromophenyl ester, {{developed}} {{for the treatment of}} cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia and Alzheimer disease, have been characterized. The 2 crystal structures have been solved, and their phase relationships have been established. The space group of form I is P 21 /c with a unit-cell volume of 1811. 6 (5) Å 3 with Z = 4. The crystals of form I were 2 -component nonmerohedral twins. The space group of form II is P 21 /n with a unit-cell volume of 1818. 6 (3) Å 3 with Z = 4. Relative stabilities have been inferred from experimental and topological P-T diagrams exhibiting an overall <b>enantiotropic</b> <b>relationship</b> between forms I and II although the solid–solid transition has never been observed. The slope of the I-II equilibrium in the P-T diagram is negative, form II is the stable phase below the solid–solid transition temperature of 371 K, and form I exhibits a stable melting equilibrium. The I-II transition temperature has been obtained from the intersection of the sublimation curves of the 2 solid forms. Postprint (author's final draft...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Some authors {{recently}} hypothesized {{the existence}} of a new retinoic acid (RA) phase in addition to the two already known polymorphs. We investigated RA polymorphism and our results exclude the presence of new modifications and refine the properties of the known forms. By comparison of simulated and acquired X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) it was possible to identify only the known monoclinic (I) and the triclinic (II) modifications; the same were also characterized by DSC, IR, and Raman spectroscopy. A solubility study associated to DSC allowed establishing an <b>enantiotropic</b> <b>relationship</b> between the two forms, with form II being less stable (DGII/I¼ 0. 71 kJ/mol at 378 C) below the transition temperature (136. 68 C; DH¼ 3. 2 kJ/mol). The intrinsic dissolution rate (IDR) (I¼ 61 mg/cm 2 min 1; II¼ 125 mg/cm 2 min 1) confirmed this energetic relationship. The kinetics of solid transition I!II was examined and its activation energy estimated (356 kJ/mol). The attempts to produce new phases allowed the development of methods to obtain the two polymorphs with high chemical and polymorphic purity. A validated DSC method is presented that enables detection of the presence of form I at a level of 1 % (w/w) when in mixture with form II...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTwo {{original}} {{series of}} highly fluorinated sulfamates and biphenyls having thermotropic mesophases are synthesized and their liquid crystal properties are studied by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) and polarizing optical microscopy (POM). Fluorinated sulfamates exhibit a wide mesophasic temperature ranges (48. 3 – 140. 5 °C). However, the fluorinated biphenyls, usually described as liquid crystals, are instable and mesophases cannot be determined. The unexpected <b>enantiotropic</b> mesophases <b>relationship</b> of fluorinated sulfamates is been reported in this work. Two structural parameters are discussed, the length of both fluorinated tail and hydrocarbon linker...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the phase}} {{behavior}} of pharmaceuticals {{is important for}} dosage form development and regulatory requirements, in particular after the incident with ritonavir. In the present paper, a comprehensive study of the solid-state phase behavior of cysteamine hydrochloride used {{in the treatment of}} nephropathic cystinosis and recently granted orphan designation by the European Commission is presented employing (high-pressure) calorimetry, water vapor sorption, and X-ray diffraction as a function of temperature. A new crystal form (I 2 /a, form III) has been discovered, and its structure has been solved by X-ray powder diffraction, while two other crystalline forms are already known. The relative thermodynamic stabilities of the commercial form I and of the newly discovered form III have been established; they possess an overall <b>enantiotropic</b> phase <b>relationship,</b> with form I stable at room temperature and form III stable above 37 degrees C. Its melting temperature was found at 67. 3 +/- 0. 5 degrees C. Cysteamine hydrochloride is hygroscopic and immediately forms a concentrated saturated solution in water with a surprisingly high concentration of 47. 5 mol % above a relative humidity of 35 %. No hydrate has been observed. A temperature composition phase diagram is presented that has been obtained with the unary pressure temperature phase diagram, measurements, and calculations. For development, form I would be the best form to use in any solid dosage form, which should be thoroughly protected against humidity. Postprint (author's final draft...|$|R
40|$|Polymorphism, {{crystal shape}} and {{solubility}} of 1, 4 -dihydroxyanthraquinone (quinizarin) {{have been investigated}} in acetic acid, acetone, acetonitrile, n-butanol and toluene. The solubility of FI and FII from 20 degrees C to 45 degrees C has been determined by a gravimetric method. By slow evaporation, pure FI was obtained from n-butanol and toluene, pure FII was obtained from acetone, while either a mixture of the two forms or pure FI was obtained from acetic acid and acetonitrile. Slurry conversion experiments have established an <b>enantiotropic</b> <b>relationship</b> between the two polymorphs and that the commercially available FI is actually a metastable polymorph of quinizarin under ambient conditions. However, {{in the absence of}} FII, FI is kinetically stable for many days over the temperature range and in the solvents investigated. FI and FII have been characterized by infrared spectroscopy (IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission and ordinary powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) at different temperatures. The crystal structure of FII has been determined by single-crystal XRD. DSC and high-temperature PXRD have shown that both FI and FII will transform into a not previously reported hightemperature form (FIII) around 185 degrees C before this form melts at 200 - 202 degrees C. By indexing FIII PXRD data, a triclinic P (1) over bar cell was assigned to FIII. The solubility of quinizarin FI and FII in the pure organic solvents used in the present work is below 2. 5 % by weight and decreases in the order: toluene, acetone, acetic acid, acetonitrile and n-butanol. The crystal shapes obtained in different solvents range from thin rods to flat plates or very flat leaves, with no clear principal difference observed between FI and FII.
