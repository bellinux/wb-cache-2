5|$|Initially, forecasters at the National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> {{predicted}} that Matthew {{would take a}} more eastern track and hit the Florida Panhandle. Because the track shifted westward, the National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued a Tropical Storm Warning from the Florida/Alabama border to Intracoastal City, Louisiana {{on the day before}} landfall.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on July 27 as detected by Meteosat imagery. By July 31 the tropical wave began being classified, using the Dvorak Technique, by satellite analysts at the National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center,</b> in part due to persistent deep convection. Shortly thereafter the system organized enough that the National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> began classifying it as Tropical Depression Five, roughly halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. The depression moved westward at 17mph (28km/h), intensifying as it did so, and eventually intensified enough to be upgraded to a tropical storm, which was named Dean by the National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center.</b>|$|E

5|$|Between 1970 and 1975, {{advisories}} for {{systems in}} the eastern Pacific basins were initiated by the Eastern Pacific <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> (EPHC) {{as part of the}} National Weather Service (NWS) office in San Francisco, California. At that time, the advisories released were written in cooperation with the United States Navy Fleet Weather Center in Alameda and the Air Force Hurricane Liaison Officer at the McClellan Air Force Base. Following the move of the <b>hurricane</b> <b>center</b> to Redwood City in 1976, track files were created and altered by Arthur Pike and were later re-modified following the release of a study in 1980. The National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> (NHC) extended its authority to the EPHC in 1988, and subsequently began maintaining the tracks.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen hours {{prior to}} Edith making {{landfall}} in Central America, the National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> warned citizens about the extreme {{danger of the}} approaching hurricane, {{and asked them to}} prepare for hurricane conditions. While the storm was located in the Gulf of Mexico, the National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued a Hurricane Warning from Cameron to Morgan City, Louisiana eighteen hours before the hurricane made landfall. Edith later struck land in the middle portion of the warning area.|$|E
5|$|In Bermuda, the National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch on August 5. The hurricane watch was later {{changed to a}} hurricane warning the following day. Dean’s approach to the island canceled numerous inbound and outbound flights. In Atlantic Canada, the National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued a hurricane warning for Nova Scotia and Sable Island, while the Canadian forecasters issued a high wind advisory.|$|E

5|$|Later on September22, the National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> began {{noting the}} {{possibility}} of increasing wind shear due to a large upper trough. Despite this, the intensity predictions did not forecast weakening within the next three days. Isaac continued to strengthen and reached hurricane status at 1200UTC on September23. However, the National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> did not operationally upgrade Isaac until 2100UTC on September23, at which time the storm was a Category2 hurricane. Thereafter, Isaac significantly intensified, and on the following day, it reached an initial peak intensity with winds of 120mph (205km/h). The National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> then predicted Isaac would become a Category4 hurricane on September25, though this did not materialize.|$|E
5|$|After {{weakening}} to a Category1 hurricane on September30, the National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> {{noted that}} very cold cloud tops still existed, though IR imagery {{indicated that the}} convection and circulation associated with the storm was becoming asymmetrical. Isaac remained a Category1 hurricane for almost 24hours, at which time the storm began to accelerate east-northeastward. Early on October1, the National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> noted that minimal deep convection persisted near the center {{and much of it}} was displaced to the north. Mid-level dry air and low-level cold air began entering the western quadrant of the storm, which caused it to begin its extratropical transition. By 0600UTC on October1, Isaac weakened to a tropical storm. The National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> noted that further weakening would be slow, due to the large wind field associated with the storm. At 1500UTC on October1, the National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued its final advisory on the storm; Isaac fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about three hours later, while located about halfway between Newfoundland and the Azores. The extratropical remnants tracked rapidly east-northeastward and affected the British Isles on October3 and October4, eventually merging with another extratropical low while north of Scotland early on October4.|$|E
5|$|At 0000UTC on September20, the {{depression}} made landfall near Punta Cabezas, Nicaragua with winds of 35mph (55km/h) and weakening was immediately forecast. Three hours later, the National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued its final advisory, as {{the lower level}} center became poorly defined because of interaction with the mountains of Central America and deep thunderstorm activity had significantly diminished. The National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> noted the possibility of regeneration, if the circulation entered into the Pacific Ocean within a few days. Although {{the depression}} never redeveloped, the remnant tropical wave emerged into the Pacific Ocean {{and contributed to the}} development of Hurricane Juliette on September21.|$|E
50|$|There were 18 {{tropical}} {{storms in}} the Eastern Pacific <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center’s</b> (EPHC) {{area of responsibility}} (AOR) this season. Twelve became hurricanes. Of those, six became major hurricanes by reaching Category 3 intensity or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. In the Central Pacific <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center’s</b> (CPHC) AOR, {{there was a major}} hurricane and two tropical storms. There was one tropical depression that did not strengthen into a storm.|$|R

5|$|Forecasters at the Central Pacific <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> began {{issuing a}} Hurricane Watch for the Big Island of Hawaii on August 31 at 0000 UTC; the {{following}} day the Central Pacific <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> (CPHC) issued a tropical storm warning at 0300 UTC and a flash flood watch. The watches and warnings prompted residents to board up windows and stock up on emergency supplies. The storm's approach also closed down beaches and prompted officials to cancel outdoor activates as a precaution and the American Red Cross opened shelters and provided emergency services. The preparations for Hurricane Jimena cost the American Red Cross $5,000 (2003 USD).|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the NHC was {{separated}} from the Miami Weather Service Forecast Office, which meant the meteorologist in charge at Miami {{was no longer in}} a position above the <b>hurricane</b> <b>center</b> director. By 1988, the NHC gained responsibility for eastern Pacific tropical cyclones as the former Eastern Pacific <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> in San Francisco was decommissioned. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew blew the WSR-57 weather radar and the anemometer off the roof of NHC's/the Miami State Weather Forecast offices. The radar was replaced with a WSR-88D NEXRAD system in April 1993 installed near Metro Zoo, near where Hurricane Andrew made landfall.|$|E

5|$|On September 9, about 16hours before Florence made landfall, the National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch from Port Arthur, Texas to Pensacola, Florida. Three hours later, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning from Pensacola to Cameron, Louisiana, with {{a tropical storm}} warning issued from Pensacola eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. Around the time of Florence moving ashore, the National <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> limited the hurricane warning from Pensacola, Florida to Morgan City, Louisiana.
