50|$|Push-to-pull, push-to-connect, push-in, push-fit, or instant {{fittings}} are {{a type of}} easily removed {{compression fitting}} or quick connect fitting that allows an air (or water) line to be attached, nominally {{without the use of}} tools (a tool is still usually required for cutting tubing to length and removal). These fittings act similar to the way regular compression fittings work, but use a resilient O-ring for sealing, and a <b>grip</b> <b>ring</b> to hold the (possibly grooved) tube in place. With metal tubing, a groove is needed to hold the tube in place. With PTFE tubing, the tube deforms around the <b>grip</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Panasonic Lumix G X Vario PZ 14-42mm is a {{zoom lens}} in the Micro Four Thirds system. It is a [...] "standard zoom"- ranging from {{moderately}} wide to moderately tele. An unusual feature {{is that the}} lens collapses to pancake size. To do so, focus-by-wire and power zoom are manually controlled by two thumb levers, not <b>grip</b> <b>rings.</b> There is no hardware switch for O.I.S, instead being controlled via the camera body. Panasonic's [...] "HD" [...] branding indicates focus and zoom motors are quiet, for videography. The optics contain Panasonic's [...] "nano surface coating".|$|R

50|$|A newer type is push-in {{compression}} fittings. These fit {{over the}} end of a tube using a <b>grip</b> <b>ring</b> to hold the sides of the tube and an O-ring to form a seal at the end.|$|E
40|$|The {{function}} of the human hand {{in terms of the}} discrete movement of the joints and the action of individual muscles is well enough understood. Little is known, however, of the movements of the hand as a whole. It is possible to talk loosely of closing, opening or cupping the hand; of selected postures such as the pinch or hook or of prehensile functions such as grasping and gripping. These terms are not only unscientific but have little or no universal connotation. The need for a system of disability evaluation of the hand in connection with industrial and insurance work has resulted in the development of several methods of analysing the {{function of}} the hand as a unit. Griffiths (1943 and personal communications) has for many years divided the functions of the hand into cylinder grip, ball <b>grip,</b> <b>ring</b> grip, pincer grip and pliers grip. These terms, although expressive and useful are somewhat selective in that they represent a series of functional end-results rather than a fundamental analysis of the potential of the hand as a whole. The units of function devised by Slocum and Pratt (1946) namely, grasp, pinch and hook-are not clearly defined nor are they comprehensive, for no allowance appears to be made, for instance, for the numerous functions of the hand in which the thumb is not in opposition. The classification proposed by McB ride (1942) divides the functions of the hand into three types: grasping by the hand as a whole, grasping between the thumb and fingers and grasping by the combined use of the palm and the digits. These three types of movement are somewhat arbitrarily conceived and do not appear to have any particular functional or anatomical basis. A terminology, {{if it is to be}} effective and generally acceptable, must develop out of a fundamental approach to the problem of the {{function of the}} hand as a whole and it seems that little has been done in this respect. The purpose of this paper is to present a method of classifying prehensile movements based on such an approach. The two discrete patterns of movement that have emerged through this study are analysed from both the anatomical and functional points of view and are termed precision grip and power grip...|$|E
50|$|The {{apparatus}} {{consists of}} two rings that hang freely from a rigid metal frame. Each ring {{is supported by a}} strap, which in turn connects to a steel cable that is suspended from the metal frame. The gymnast, who <b>grips</b> one <b>ring</b> with each hand, must control the movement of the rings and his body movements during all time.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of human protoporphyrin metalation remains under investigation. Many researchers have hypothesized {{distortion of the}} porphyrin macrocycle as key to catalysis. Researchers studying Bacillus subtilis ferrochelatase propose a mechanism for iron insertion into protoporphyrin in which the enzyme tightly <b>grips</b> <b>rings</b> B, C, and D while bending ring A 36o. Normally planar, this distortion exposes the {{lone pair of electrons}} on the nitrogen in ring A to the Fe+2 ion. Subsequent investigation revealed a 100o distortion in protoporphyrin bound to human ferrochelatase. A highly conserved histidine residue (His183 in B. subtilis, His263 in humans) is essential for determining the type of distortion, as well as acting as the initial proton acceptor from protoporphyrin. Anionic residues form a pathway facilitating proton movement away from the catalytic histidine. Frataxin chaperones iron to the matrix side of ferrochelatase, where aspartate and histidine residues on both proteins coordinate iron transfer into ferrochelatase. Two arginine and tyrosine residues in the active site (Arg164, Tyr165) may perform the final metalation.|$|R

All special purpose models come only in black trim with either blued, non-glare matte blue, or parkerized finishes and come with drilled and tapped receivers for scope and optics mounting.|$|R
50|$|The rings, {{also known}} as steady rings or still rings (in {{contrast}} to flying rings), is an artistic gymnastics apparatus and the event that uses it. It is traditionally used only by male gymnasts, due to its extreme upper-body strength requirements. Gymnasts typically wear <b>ring</b> <b>grips</b> while performing on the rings.|$|R
50|$|Most {{competitive}} gymnasts wear dowel grips. On {{the high}} bar, men use grips that have three finger holes {{and a small}} dowel, whereas grips used on the still rings have a larger dowel and two finger holes. Grips used on the parallel bars have two finger holes and a small dowel. Women's grips have two finger holes and resemble men's <b>ring</b> <b>grips.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A throw is {{a simple}} metal grip for the player's finger or thumb, {{attached}} to a valve slide. The general term [...] "throw" [...] can describe a u-hook, a saddle (u-shaped <b>grips),</b> or a <b>ring</b> (ring-shape <b>grip)</b> in which a player's finger or thumb rests. A player extends a finger or thumb to lengthen a slide, and retracts the finger to return the slide to its original position.|$|R
5000|$|Benjamin Goodison (c. 1700 - 1767), of London, was a royal cabinetmaker to George II of Great Britain, {{supplying}} furnishings to {{the royal}} palaces from 1727 {{to the time of}} his death. He served his apprenticeship with James Moore, who died accidentally in October 1726; Moore was the pre-eminent London cabinetmaker during the reign of George I. Goodison's classicizing case furniture owes much of its inspiration to the neo-Palladian designs of William Kent; outstanding documented examples are the pair of part-gilded mahogany commodes and library writing-tables Goodison made for Sir Thomas Robinson of Rokeby Hall, Yorkshire, now in the Royal Collection; they have boldly-scaled Greek key fret in their friezes and lion masks <b>gripping</b> brass <b>rings</b> heading scrolling consoles at their corners.|$|R

5000|$|Self-locking or spring-closing show-lead nose rings, {{also called}} [...] "bulldogs" [...] or nose <b>grips,</b> are {{removable}} <b>rings</b> {{that do not}} require the nose to be pierced. They are often used on steers and cows, along with a halter, at agricultural shows, or when handling cattle for examination, marking or treatment. They stay shut until released, and usually have a loop for the attachment of a cord or lead rope. They give similar control to a bull ring without the need for permanent attachment.|$|R
60|$|The {{snow had}} ceased to fall, but for a week a hard frost had held the country side in its iron <b>grip.</b> The roads <b>rang</b> under the horses' hoofs, and every wayside ditch and runlet was a street of ice. Over the long undulating {{landscape}} the red brick houses peeped out warmly against the spotless background, and the lines of grey smoke streamed straight up into the windless air. The sky was of the lightest palest blue, and the morning sun, shining through the distant fog-wreaths of Birmingham, struck a subdued glow from the broad-spread snow fields which might have gladdened the eyes of an artist.|$|R

As for Müller, {{he was just}} fat, oily, pompous, {{conscious}} of his own importance as a witness; his fat fingers, covered with brass <b>rings,</b> <b>gripped</b> the two incriminating letters, which he had identified. They were his passports, as it were, to a delightful land of importance and notoriety. Sir Arthur Inglewood, I think, disappointed him by stating {{that he had no}} questions to ask of him. Müller had been brimful of answers, ready with the most perfect indictment, the most elaborate accusations against the bloated millionaire who had decoyed his dear friend Kershaw, and murdered him in Heaven knows what an out-of-the-way corner of the East End.|$|R
40|$|Voluntary {{movement}} generally inhibits sensory systems. However, it is {{not clear}} how such movement influences pain. In the present study, subjects actively or passively experienced mechanical pain or pressure during functional MRI scanning. Pain and pressure were induced using two modified <b>grip</b> strengthener <b>rings,</b> each twined with four crystal bead strings, with polyhedral beads to induce pain, or spherical beads to induce pressure. Subjects held one ring in the left hand and were either asked to squeeze their left hand with their right hand (i. e., active pain or pressure), or to have their left hand squeezed by the experimenter (i. e., passive pain or pressure). Subjects rated the intensity and unpleasantness of the pain sensation lower in the active procedure than in the passive one. Correspondingly, pain-related brain areas were inhibited in the case of self-generated pain, including the primary somatosensory cortex (SI), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the thalamus. These results suggest that active movement behaviorally inhibits concomitant mechanical pain, accompanied by an inhibition of pain response in pain-related brain areas such as the SI cortex. This might be part of the mechanisms underlying the kinesitherapy for pain treatment...|$|R

2500|$|As is told in The Hobbit, Bilbo {{found the}} Ring shortly {{afterward}} while {{lost in the}} tunnels near Gollum's lair. When The Hobbit was written, Tolkien had not yet conceived of the Ring's sinister history. Thus, in {{the first edition of}} The Hobbit, Gollum surrenders the Ring to Bilbo as a reward for winning the Riddle Game. When Tolkien revised the nature of the Ring for The Lord of the Rings, he realized that the <b>Ring's</b> <b>grip</b> on Gollum would never permit him to give it up willingly. Tolkien therefore revised the second edition of The Hobbit: after losing the Riddle Game to Bilbo, Gollum went to get his [...] "Precious" [...] (as he always called it) so he could kill and eat Bilbo, but flew into a rage when he found the Ring missing. Deducing from Bilbo's last question—"What have I got in my pocket?"—that Bilbo had found the Ring, Gollum chased him through the caves, not realizing that the hobbit had discovered the Ring's powers of invisibility and was following him to the cave's exit. Bilbo escaped Gollum and the goblins by remaining invisible, but when he rejoined Gandalf and the dwarves he was travelling with, he decided not to tell them that the Ring had made him invisible. [...] In fact he told them a story that closely followed the first edition of The Hobbit: that Gollum had given him the Ring and showed him the way out. Gandalf was not convinced and later forced the real story from Bilbo; he was thus immediately suspicious of the Ring.|$|R
