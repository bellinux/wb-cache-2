They might react to changes in asset prices without introducing asset prices into the description of their policy objectives. We show that, the more flexible the inflation-targeting framework of monetary policy is, the more likely the monetary authorities are able to stabilise the economy around the long-term equilibrium. Therefore, achieving price stability under inflation-targeting regime with low flexibility can generate dynamic instability and {{will not be able to}} stabilise effectively the fluctuations of output and inflation. A commitment to a long run growth rate of money supply corresponding to the inflation target can reinforce the credibility of the central bank and the role of inflation target as strong and credible nominal anchor for private inflation expectations and allows the system to be more stability prone. ...|$|R

The short-run results based on vector error-correction modeling, on the other hand, support the New Keynesians' view that money is non- neutral, at least in the short-run.

40|$|Stage Three of the European Monetary Union (EMU) {{will start}} on January 1, 1999. The new {{currency}} area, {{for which the}} name "Euroland" has been coined, will comprise 11 countries: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. The project of a single currency has enhanced economic convergence among the participating countries to some degree, but differences {{with respect to the}} business cycle have remained pronounced. This can also be expected for EMU. A single monetary policy for Euroland will not affect regions uniformly, given the substantial differences between the participating countries with respect to, for example, institutional arrangements in financial markets and in labor markets, the public share in the economy or the structure of production. It is often argued that monetary policy in Europe is currently too tight; consequently, the upswing is at risk or even deflation is around the corner. This view is not supported by the facts. Various indicators suggest that monetary policy is actually quite easy. Given that European short-term interest rates are bound to converge around summer at a historically low level and key interest rates will hardly be raised substantially in the immediate future, monetary policy will remain loose for the time being. This policy increasingly bears some risk of accelerating inflation. In any event, there is no risk of outright deflation in Euroland. It is still an open question whether the European Central Bank (ECB) will use a monetary aggregate as an <b>intermediate</b> <b>target</b> (<b>monetary</b> <b>targeting)</b> or try to directly adjust monetary policy to (forecasted) inflationary developments (inflation targeting). Empirical work suggests that money demand in Euroland is sufficiently stable to pursue <b>monetary</b> <b>targeting.</b> Even if instability were to occur in the transition period and right after the introduction of the euro, this would not necessarily imply the superiority of inflation targeting because under such circumstances the reliability of inflation forecasts is reduced as well. The advantage of implementing the <b>monetary</b> <b>targeting</b> strategy that had proved to be successful in Germany would be that it allows the ECB to gain some of the Bundesbank's reputation. In 1997 public deficits in all countries of Euroland were kept within the limit of 3 percent of GDP set in the Maastricht Treaty. However, further consolidation is necessary in most countries {{in order to meet the}} obligations of the Stability and Growth Pact. Ultimately, the fiscal positions have to be sustainable in the long term. A rough calculation suggests that at present only a few of the prospective EMU countries have a sustainable fiscal position. In addition, fiscal policy seems to be less sustainable because in some countries one-off measures contributed significantly to the reduction of the 1997 deficits. After EMU is established, bilateral exchange rates as possible shock absorber cease to exist and other mechanisms of adjusting to a negative (external) shock are necessary in order to prevent unemployment from rising. The most important adjustment mechanism left is flexibility of wages. It would be counterproductive to increasingly negotiate wage settlements at the European level. Against the background of the rising need for differentiation, decisions that affect employment should, to the contrary, be more and more decentralized. [...] ...|$|R

Exploiting the time dimension of our data to eliminate country fixed effects and using instrumental variable estimation to overcome endogeneity concerns, we present evidence that greater CBI is associated with lower inflation.

The reserve requirement systems in sub-Saharan Africa are relatively simple and transparent, but in some countries high unremunerated reserve ratios impose a significant implicit tax on the banks. The currency denomination of the foreign-currency reserve deposits raises concern in countries undergoing large macroeconomic changes or experiencing exchange rate volatility.

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{issues to}} consider when designing the structure, size, and composition of the governing boards and management of a central bank. While central bank autonomy and accountability are generally accepted as good practice, there is less consensus regarding the structure, size, and composition of the governing bodies. This paper surveys 101 central bank laws covering 113 countries and classifies the governance structure according to degree of autonomy, functions performed, size, composition, appointment procedures, and terms of the members. The paper concludes that an appropriate balance must be struck between {{the functions of the}} governing entities, simplicity, and country specific factors. The functions of the various bodies follow logically if a greater appreciation exists for the type of autonomy delegated to the central bank.

40|$|After {{the switch}} to a {{floating}} exchange rate in 1973, the Swiss National Bank at first adopted annual <b>monetary</b> <b>targets</b> and in the 1990 s shifted to a medium-term targeting strategy. In this paper I review the SNB's internal policy analysis, an aspect of Swiss <b>monetary</b> <b>targeting</b> that has received little attention in the existing literature. I show that money {{played a key role}} in setting monetary policy and in communicating the SNB's decisions to the public. Due to the adoption of <b>monetary</b> <b>targets,</b> the SNB was able to reduce the inflation trend to low levels. However, it was less successful in preserving price stability during business-cycle expansions because the <b>monetary</b> <b>targets</b> did not call for a sufficiently preemptive policy stance. At the end of 1999, the SNB abandoned <b>monetary</b> <b>targeting</b> in favour of an approach based on inflation forecasts...|$|R
40|$|This Paper {{compares the}} social {{efficiency}} of <b>monetary</b> <b>targeting</b> and inflation targeting when central banks may have private information on shocks to money demand and, because of verifiability problems, the transparency solution is not feasible. Under inflation <b>targeting</b> and <b>monetary</b> <b>targeting,</b> central banks {{may have an}} incentive to signal their private information in order to influence the public's expectations about future inflation. We show that inflation targeting is superior to <b>monetary</b> <b>targeting</b> as it makes it easier for central banks to commit to low inflation. Moreover, central banks that are weak on inflation prefer inflation <b>targeting</b> to <b>monetary</b> <b>targeting.</b> central banks; commitment; inflation targeting; monetary targeting; signalling...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the project is to analyse and assess the effectiveness of traditional <b>monetary</b> <b>targetting</b> in achieving the final targets of economic growth and price stability in a liberalised financial environment. It covers the important issue related to <b>monetary</b> <b>targetting</b> that {{is whether or not}} the relationship between <b>monetary</b> <b>targets</b> and final targets is stable. According to the empirical study, only one country has the stable money demand function which increases the effectiveness of monetary policy and attributes to financial liberalisation. ...|$|R
