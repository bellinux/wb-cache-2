5|$|Control of the plant, when desired, is best managed via {{mechanical}} means, such as hand pulling and hoeing, preferably {{followed by}} sowing of native plants. Animals rarely graze {{it because of}} its irritating hairs, and liquid <b>herbicides</b> require surfactants to be effective, as the hair causes water to roll off the plant, much like the lotus effect. Burning is ineffective, as it only creates new bare areas for seedlings to occupy. G. tetrum and Cucullia verbasci usually have little effect on V.thapsus populations as a whole. Goats and chickens have also been proposed to control mullein. Effective (when used with a surfactant) contact <b>herbicides</b> include glyphosate, triclopyr and sulfurometuron-methyl.

5|$|During the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960), Britain was {{the first}} nation to employ the use of <b>herbicides</b> and defoliants to destroy bushes, trees, and {{vegetation}} to deprive insurgents of concealment and targeting food crops {{as part of a}} starvation campaign in the early 1950s. A detailed account of how the British experimented with the spraying of <b>herbicides</b> was written by two scientists, E.K.

40|$|One {{hypothesis}} of triazine-type <b>herbicide</b> action in photosynthetic material {{is that the}} <b>herbicide</b> molecule competes with a secondary quinone acceptor, B, for a binding site at the reaction center of photosystem II. The binding affinity of B has been suggested to change with its level of reduction, being most strongly bound in its semiquinone form. To test this hypothesis, [14 C]atrazine binding studies {{have been carried out}} under different photochemically induced levels of B reduction in Pisum sativum. It is found that <b>herbicide</b> binding is reduced in continuously illuminated samples compared to dark-adapted samples. Decreased binding of atrazine corresponds to an increase in the semiquinone form of B. With flash excitation, the <b>herbicide</b> binding oscillates with a cycle of two, being low on odd-numbered flashes when the amount of semiquinone form of B is greatest. Treatment with NH 2 OH was found to significantly decrease the strength of <b>herbicide</b> binding in the dark as well as stop the ability of p-benzoquinone to oxidize the semiquinone form of B. It is suggested that the mode of action of NH 2 OH is disruption of quinones or their environment on both the oxidizing and reducing sides of photosystem II. <b>Herbicide</b> binding was found to be unaltered under conditions when p-benzosemiquinone oxidation of the reduced primary acceptor, Q−, is <b>herbicide</b> insensitive; weak <b>herbicide</b> binding cannot explain this <b>herbicide</b> insensitivity. It is concluded that the quinone-herbicide competition theory of <b>herbicide</b> action is correct.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a breeding protocol {{that can be used to}} specifically transfer and select imidazolinone <b>herbicide</b> tolerant wheat lines in segregating populations for the FS 2 gene that confers imidazolinone <b>herbicide</b> tolerance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A preliminary study found that most of Nebraska winter wheat cultivars are lacking any tolerance for imazamox <b>herbicide</b> in the seedling stage. Two field studies in consecutive years (2000 and 2001) in Lincoln, Nebraska and screening experiment in the greenhouse for heads taken from the segregating populations after different imazamox <b>herbicide</b> treatments showed that using the 2 x rate of imazamox <b>herbicide</b> where x is the recommended <b>herbicide</b> rate in the field 45 g ai/ha of imazamox <b>herbicide</b> is the appropriate rate to remove all of the homozygous susceptible and most of the heterozygous plants without noticeable adverse affects on the homozygous tolerant plants. ^ Using the 2 x rate in an early generation in the segregating populations successfully selects for <b>herbicide</b> tolerance and this would allow plant breeders to select for other agronomic and quality traits in following generations. One <b>herbicide</b> selection treatment was needed to effectively select <b>herbicide</b> tolerant plants. However, two selection treatments would add an additional level of confidence should a single <b>herbicide</b> treatment not be completely effective (i. e. some heterozygous plants survived). Treating segregating populations for FS 2 gene with 2 x of imazamox <b>herbicide</b> causes plants to die and hence reduced plant density. Like many other studies in wheat, reduction of plant density caused a delay in flowering; and a reduction in plant height, grain yield, and grain volume weight. However once the susceptible and heterozygous plants are removed, the populations after spraying have full stand density and can be treated as ‘normal’ population for agronomic selection. ...|$|R

Four different <b>herbicide</b> strategies were applied: An ALS inhibitor each year, a soil-acting <b>herbicide</b> each year, an alternation between ALS inhibitor and soil-acting <b>herbicide</b> and a combination of several herbicidal mode of action groups. To assess the spatial distribution of resistant biotypes, plant samples were taken on fixed grid points before and after the <b>herbicide</b> treatment.

Four <b>herbicide</b> doses (0, 3, 5 and 7 L ha - 1) was arranged in main plots and three seeding rates (100, 120 and 140 kg seed ha - 1) in subplots. Interaction of <b>herbicide</b> and crop density on dry matter and yield of rice and barnyard-grass was significant. Therefore, response of variance trends of these traits to <b>herbicide</b> in different densities was different. While no <b>herbicide</b> was be used, rice yield in density 120 was higher than other densities, that showed that optimum crop density could increased crop competition ability and decreased <b>herbicide</b> use. In other hand, it be observed that highest and lowest yield of crop and weed, respectively, was be related to 5 L <b>herbicide</b> ha - 1. In this case, there was little difference between different densities. With more <b>herbicide</b> use, probably due to toxicity effect, crop yield decreased. However, in this <b>herbicide</b> dose, density 120 showed lesser changes in crop yield. In density 120, crop and weed yield relationship have lesser slope in comparison with other densities.

40|$|The {{potential}} for human-driven evolution in economically and environmentally important organisms in medicine, agriculture and conservation management is now widely recognised. The evolution of <b>herbicide</b> resistance in weeds {{is a classic}} example of rapid adaptation in the face of human-mediated selection. Management strategies that aim to slow or prevent the evolution of <b>herbicide</b> resistance must be informed by an understanding of the ecological and evolutionary factors that drive selection in weed populations. Here, we argue for a greater focus on the ultimate causes of selection for resistance in <b>herbicide</b> resistance studies. The emerging fields of eco-evolutionary dynamics and applied evolutionary biology offer a means to achieve this goal and to consider <b>herbicide</b> resistance in a broader and sometimes novel context. Four relevant research questions are presented, which examine (i) the impact of <b>herbicide</b> dose on selection for resistance, (ii) plant fitness in <b>herbicide</b> resistance studies, (iii) the efficacy of <b>herbicide</b> rotations and mixtures and (iv) the impacts of gene flow on resistance evolution and spread.
