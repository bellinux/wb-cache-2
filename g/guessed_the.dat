5|$|A {{new game}} was also {{introduced}} {{on the roof}} of BBC Television Centre called Sacrifice Your Family which Cawood hosted that put two families against each other in various games. This was later renamed Sacrifice Your Friends in 2001. Other features included Talk To The Hand where a celebrity had to answer questions from viewers with the option to only be able to pass one of the questions {{with the use of the}} hand and L Most Wanted where viewers could win prizes if they could spot a three digit number clue placed somewhere throughout the show which was the code to the cage containing the prizes. The winner was the one who <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> correct order out of a possible six combinations.|$|E

Lauren then {{converted}} the next penalty for Arsenal, before Scholes stepped up to take United's second, only to see it saved by Lehmann, diving low to his right. The next six penalties were all scored – Ljungberg, Van Persie and Cole for Arsenal, Ronaldo, Rooney and Keane for Manchester United – leaving Vieira with the opportunity to win the FA Cup for his team. Although Carroll <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> correct way to dive, Vieira's kick was just out of his reach, giving Arsenal their 10th FA Cup.|$|E

5|$|The Mediterranean {{campaign}} of 1798 {{was a series}} of major naval operations surrounding a French expeditionary force sent to Egypt under Napoleon Bonaparte during the French Revolutionary Wars. The French Republic sought to capture Egypt as the first stage in an effort to threaten British India, and thus force Great Britain to make peace. Departing Toulon in May 1798 with over 40,000 troops and hundreds of ships, Bonaparte's fleet sailed southeastwards across the Mediterranean Sea. They were followed by a small British squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson, later reinforced to 13 ships of the line, whose pursuit was hampered by a lack of scouting frigates and reliable information. Bonaparte's first target was the island of Malta, which was under the government of the Knights of St. John and theoretically granted its owner control of the Central Mediterranean. Bonaparte's forces landed on the island and rapidly overwhelmed the defenders, securing the port city of Valletta before continuing to Egypt. When Nelson learned of the French capture of the island, he <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> French target to be Egypt and sailed for Alexandria, but passed the French during the night of 22 June without discovering them and arrived off Egypt first.|$|E
5|$|The {{departure}} of the Batavian squadron was noticed by Donnelly's small blockade force, which shadowed the Batavian ships as they passed southwards down the coast of Jutland, losing sight of them at 22:00 on 11 May. Donnelly correctly <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> Batavian force's destination, and ordered Sylph to separate, the two vessels following different courses, instructing White to proceed to Duncan's blockade fleet and meet Donnelly there if {{he was unable to}} rediscover the Batavian squadron en route. Pegasus and Sylph encountered one another shortly before 05:00 on 12 May close to Duncan's fleet south of the Texel but without having located the Batavian squadron. Argo and her consorts had sailed close to the Danish and German coasts during the night, seizing in passing a British cutter named Duke of York, travelling from Yarmouth to Hamburg. At dawn on 12 May the Batavian ships were off the Batavian coast sailing southwest towards the Texel anchorage.|$|E
5|$|On 16 June, United {{embarked}} for Salt Lake City for an 18 June away game at Real Salt Lake. Played at Rio Tinto Stadium, {{the venue}} {{has been considered}} by fans and media alike {{to be one of}} the most hostile environments in MLS and in North American to play in. In franchise history, United had not only failed to win in Rio Tinto, but failed to earn a point in the stadium. In spite of Salt Lake's struggling form, and United's improved form, many still expected Real to defeat United, having the home field advantage and a stronger roster. The 18 June fixture played to a 1–1 tie thanks to penalty kicks from Salt Lake's Fabian Espindola and United's Charlie Davies. The match was marred for its extremely physical, sometimes ruthless play, as well as the lack of discipline imposed by center referee, Terry Vaughn, who only gave one yellow card the entire match. Espindola scored the opening goal in the 38th minute. The penalty was drawn when Salt Lake captain, Kyle Beckerman dribbled within the goal box. As Beckerman dribbled inwards, United's Clyde Simms mistime a slide tackle that missed Beckerman, but resulted in his right wrist deflecting Beckerman's pass into the box. In the second half, United continued to control a majority of the ball position, only to see Chris Pontius's shot deflect off the crossbar in the 53rd minute. Controversy further ignited on what many fans and journalists declared a dive from United's Davies, who drew a penalty kick in the 85th minute, following a breakaway counterattack. The declaration was near universal as video replay and still frames of the incident in the penalty box revealed Davies falling in a diving motion prior to Salt Lake defender, Chris Wingert making any contact with Davies, only to do so once Davies had already fallen down. In spite of this, center official Terry Vaughn whistled it to be a penalty kick. Met with heavy jeers at Rio Tinto, Davies successfully bagged the match tying goal, in spite of the fact that Salt Lake's goalkeeper, a former United player, Nick Rimando, <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> correct way. In the 92nd minute, during stoppage time, Salt Lake's Jamison Olave recklessly fouled United's Blake Brettschneider to draw a final set piece, possibly to allow United to earn a shocking road win in Salt Lake. However, Najar's free kick was successfully passed to Pontius, whose shot deflected off the crossbar, allowing the match to remain leveled at one apiece. At the match's end heavy boos were ignited by the Salt Lake crowd, primarily directed towards the officiating. The match was deemed as one of the most reckless matches of 2011.|$|E

25|$|Middlesbrough {{produced}} {{their worst}} away {{performance of the}} season thus far against Fulham, as they slumped to a 3–0 defeat. Julio Arca was lucky not to be red-carded for a late over-the-top challenge on Andy Johnson, earning only a yellow card. Jimmy Bullard got the opening goal after Turnbull could only parry Bobby Zamora's shot. Next, {{for the third time}} in three games, a penalty decision went against Boro, as Tony McMahon was adjudged to have handled the ball after the ball struck his arm from close range. Turnbull <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> right way but was unable to save Danny Murphy's penalty kick. Clint Dempsey got the third to round off Fulham's win.|$|E
25|$|In late 1944, Soviet forces battled {{fiercely}} {{to capture}} Hungary in the Budapest Offensive, {{but could not}} take it, which became a topic so sensitive to Stalin that he refused to allow his commanders to speak of it. The Germans held out in the subsequent Battle of Budapest until February 1945, when the remaining Hungarians signed an armistice with the Soviet Union. Victory at Budapest permitted the Red Army to launch the Vienna Offensive in April 1945. To the northeast, the taking of Belarus and western Ukraine permitted the Soviets to launch the massive Vistula–Oder Offensive, where German intelligence had incorrectly <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> Soviets would have a 3-to-1 numerical superiority advantage that was actually 5-to-1 (over 2 million Red Army personnel attacking 450,000 German defenders), the successful culmination of {{which resulted in the}} Red Army advancing from the Vistula River in Poland to the German Oder River in Eastern Germany.|$|E

Kniess, an avid viewer of the show, recorded and watched every episode for four months prior to {{when he and his wife}} had tickets to attend in September 2008. Kniess learned that many prizes were repeatedly used (always at the same price) and began taking notes. Kniess was selected as a contestant on September 22, 2008, lost his pricing game (the only contestant to do so that episode), made it to the final showcase and <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> exact amount of $23,743 for his showcase. Many show staffers, including Carey, were worried that the show was rigged and that Kniess was cheating. Kniess later explained that he had seen all three items of the showcase before and knew the general prices in the thousands. The 743 he used because it was his PIN, based on his wedding date and his wife's birth month.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, the {{corporate}} entity, American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, was renamed as the American Broadcasting Companies, while its cinema division became ABC Theatres; its recording division was renamed ABC Records in 1966. In December of that year, the ABC television network premiered The Dating Game, a pioneer series in its genre, {{which was a}} reworking of the blind date concept in which a suitor selected one of three contestants sight unseen based on the answers to selected questions. This was followed up in July 1966 by The Newlywed Game, featuring three recently married couples who <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> responses to their partner's questions (some of which were fairly risque). As ABC began to outgrow its facilities at 7 West 66th Street, Goldenson found a new headquarters for ABC in a 44-story building located at 1330 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan, {{at the corner of}} 54th Street (now occupied by The Financial Timess New York office). This operation allowed for the conversion of the premises at 66th Street into production facilities for television and radio programs.|$|E
25|$|Bengaluru began March with an away {{game against}} Mumbai. After {{persistent}} attack from both sides, Bengaluru scored first when Eugeneson Lyngdoh curled a {{shot into the}} far corner. Mumbai equalized quickly {{in the second half}} via Josimar. Bengaluru created chances late in the game, but man of the match, Mumbai goalkeeper Nidhin Lal, saved all the attempts and both teams eventually shared a point. After the mid-season break, Bengaluru played the away game against Salgaocar. The game also marked the return of top players of Bengaluru, who were away for the national duty. Bengaluru enjoyed a lion share of possession, but could not convert any chances {{in the first half and}} the game remained goalless. Robin Singh finally broke the deadlock with a pass from Rino Anto. Salgaocar had the chance to equalize when they were awarded penalty, but man of the match Lalthuammawia Ralte, correctly <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> direction and saved the penalty to secure 3 points for Bengaluru. Bengaluru ended the March on a high note with a convincing 4–1 victory at home against Sporting Clube de Goa. Bengaluru took the lead in the first half when Josh Walker's header converted a pass from Eugeneson Lyngdoh in a goal. Rino Anto, Thoi Singh, and Beikhokhei Beingaichho scored a goal each in the second half. Sporting Goa's multiple attacks, especially from Odafe Onyeka Okolie, were thwarted by man of the match Lalthuammawia Ralte.|$|E
25|$|The replay (the last semi-final replay in {{the history}} of the FA Cup) went down as one of the {{greatest}} games ever played. David Beckham opened the scoring with a curving shot past Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman from 22 yards, but Dennis Bergkamp equalised halfway through the second half, his shot deflecting off the knee of Jaap Stam. Nicolas Anelka had the ball in the back of the net for Arsenal again shortly afterwards, and the celebrations were well underway before anyone realised that the linesman had flagged Anelka offside before the goal was scored. Roy Keane then received a second booking and was sent off for a cynical foul on Marc Overmars, leaving Manchester United to play out the match with 10 men. The match was heading for extra time when Phil Neville made a tired challenge on Ray Parlour inside the penalty area; Bergkamp stepped up to take the penalty, but Peter Schmeichel <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> direction of his kick correctly and it was at a good height for him to make the save. The first half of extra time passed without incident, before Patrick Vieira gave the ball away to Giggs at the start of the second; Giggs ran from just inside his own half, taking on four Arsenal defenders as he drove into the penalty area, then shot from a narrow angle over the head of Seaman into the roof of the Arsenal net. Manchester United hung on for the remaining 10 minutes to secure their place in the final.|$|E

500|$|It {{is known}} from his {{notebooks}} that Newton was grappling {{in the late}} 1660s {{with the idea that}} terrestrial gravity extends, in an inverse-square proportion, to the Moon; however it took him two decades to develop the full-fledged theory. The question was not whether gravity existed, but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the Moon to its orbit. Newton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon's orbital period, and get good agreement. He <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it [...] "universal gravitation".|$|E
500|$|Among {{the most}} {{frequent}} topics of discussion are the real-life location of Springfield, the sexuality of Waylon Smithers and [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?", a two-episode publicity stunt in which Mr. Burns was shot by an unknown character.

Although the alt.tv.simpsons community debated this mystery to an extreme degree, no one officially <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> right answer, and therefore no one was ever animated on the show. Due to contest regulations, a winner had to be selected out of {{a random sample of}} entries.

500|$|Billen {{called the}} episode [...] "distressing comedy to watch", {{but said that}} [...] "the acting, the scripting, the satisfactions of one-act {{resolution}} and the laughter it generated" [...] were redeeming qualities, and gave the episode four {{out of a possible}} five stars. Dessau felt that parts of the script were predicable, but some twists [...] "catch you completely unaware", while the ending [...] "may haunt [...] for days". Jack Seale, of the Radio Times, suggested that viewers will believe that they have <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> plot by the half-way point in the episode. However, he said that the writers [...] "give their story of how we're all one slip away from the gutter a chilling sense of rising dread" [...] which counteracts this. [...] "Nobody", he said, [...] "plays wicked games with the audience more skilfully." [...] Larushka Ivan-Zadeh and Carol Carter, writing in Metro, suggested that viewers would want to rewatch the episode in an attempt to pick up clues to the plot twists that they originally missed.|$|E

While they were away, the rest of the housemates attempted {{to break out of the}} House and Big Brother responded by reducing the £100,000 prize fund to zero, later announcing that the housemates would be given a chance to win back the money over the course of the next few days. As Siavash refused to nominate, Big Brother allocated his nominations to Charlie and Sophie and Marcus and Siavash were put up for eviction. On Day 85, Siavash accepted the offer of £10,000 towards the prize fund for exchanging his clothes with an outfit provided by Big Brother and the Housemates received a £20 cheque after requesting a mystery prize from the weekly shopping list. Later that day, Marcus rejected Big Brother's offer of £15,000 to shave his ponytail and the group turned down the chance to win £1,500 by swimming 1,500 lengths of the pool. On Day 86, Rodrigo won £6,000 towards the prize fund by correctly <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> regional locations of three animals after listening to a series of sound effects. Later that day, Marcus was evicted with 64.0% of the public vote.|$|E
500|$|Groening {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} an episode in which the character Mr. Burns was shot, which {{could be used as a}} publicity stunt. The writers decided to write the episode [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" [...] in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. Part one was the final episode of the sixth season and originally aired on the Fox network on May 21, 1995. Part two was the premiere of the seventh season and originally aired on September 17, 1995. It was important for the writers to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who seemed the obvious culprit. In the months following the broadcast of the first part, there was widespread debate among fans of the series as to who shot Mr. Burns. Fox offered a contest to tie in with the mystery where the viewers could guess who the culprit was. It ran from August 13 to September 10 and was one of the first contests to tie together elements of television and the internet. Fox launched a new website, www.Springfield.com, devoted to the mystery which got over 500,000 hits during the summer of 1995. The winner would be animated on an episode of the show. No one, however, was ever animated on the show. This was because no one officially <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> right answer, so the chosen winner did not have the right answer and was paid a cash prize in lieu of being animated.|$|E
