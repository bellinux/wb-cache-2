40|$|We {{study the}} quantum phase {{transition}} occurring in an infinite homogeneous system of spin 1 / 2 fermions in a non-relativistic context. As an example we consider neutrons interacting through a simple spin-spin <b>Heisenberg</b> <b>force.</b> The two critical values of the coupling strength — signaling the onset into the system of a finite magnetization and of the total magnetization, respectively — are found and their dependence upon {{the range of the}} interaction is explored. The spin response function of the system in the region where the spin-rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken is also studied. For a ferromagnetic interaction the spin response along the direction of the spontaneous magnetization occurs in the particle-hole continuum and displays, for not too large momentum transfers, two distinct peaks. The response along the direction orthogonal to the spontaneous magnetization displays instead, beyond a softened and depleted particle-hole continuum, a collective mode to be identified with a Goldstone boson of type II. Notably, the random phase approximation on a Hartree-Fock basis accounts for it, in particular for its quadratic — close to the origin — dispersion relation. It is shown that the Goldstone boson contributes to the saturation of the energy-weighted sum rule for ≈ 25 % when the system becomes fully magnetized (that is in correspondence of the upper critical value of the interaction strength) and continues to grow as the interaction strength increases. Key words: spontaneous symmetry breaking, response functions, random phase approximation PACS: 21. 60. Jz, 26. 60. +c, 75. 25. +z, 11. 30. Qc...|$|E
40|$|Spin Hall effect (SHE) in a 2 D-Rashba {{system has}} been treated in the spin-dependent {{precession}} [J. Sinova et al., Phys. Rev. Letts. 92, 126603 (2004). ] and the time-space gauge [T. Fujita et al., New J. Phys. 12, 013016 (2010). ] approaches, both yielding SHE conductivity of σ_y^z=e/ 8 π. Separate studies based {{on the concept of}} spin transverse force [S-Q Shen, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 187203 (2005). ] provide a heuristic but not a quantifiable indication of SHE. In this paper, we provide a more complete description of the SHE using the Heisenberg approach, unifying the Yang-Mills <b>force,</b> the <b>Heisenberg</b> spin <b>force,</b> and the SHE σ_y^z under the classical notion of forces and accelerations. Central to this paper is the spin force equations that are satisfied by both σ_y^z and σ_x^z, the Yang-Mills, and the <b>Heisenberg</b> spin <b>forces.</b> By linking σ_y^z to the spin forces, one sees that the physics of SHE in a 2 D-Rashba system is also a simple classical Lorentz force picture.

40|$|A {{diffusion}} {{cloud chamber}} and its ancillary equipment were constructed {{and used to}} investigate the energy spectrum of fast neutrons produced by bombarding deuterium in the chamber with 85 Mev protons. Reasons are adduced to show that these fast neutrons {{are the result of}} an exchange collision caused by a <b>Heisenberg</b> type of <b>force</b> in which the spins of the nucleons are also exchanged. There is, however, disagreement with the calculations of Gluckstern and Bethe, who predicted a much narrower energy spectrum for the fast neutrons than we found by experiment. We suggest reasons for the discrepancy...|$|R
5000|$|Heisenberg - A shape-shifting fractal biot {{built by}} Max Madison Jr. using nanites grown in space by Sean One, named by Maxwell after the German {{physicist}} Werner Heisenberg. Heisenberg {{is the first}} stable fractal biot created by Maximum, and is controlled by Maxwell using a separate remote brain which must be carried around in a case. <b>Heisenberg</b> is <b>forced</b> to impersonate the Phantom and succeeds in criminalising him {{with the help of}} Dr. Jak, but after a confrontation with the Phantom, Maxwell loses the remote brain and hence control of Heisenberg. Afterwards, the fractal biot gains independence and a form of sentience, dons a cloak and seeks answers for his past, remembering nothing of his creation other than his name. He meets a wise street saxophonist named Betty, and after deciding to take his own path, becomes a [...] "teacher" [...] to biots everywhere, helping them to be free from their human owners and become self-aware. Heisenberg eventually joins the Phantom and becomes a close companion to Pavlova, Dr. Jaks assistant. Voiced by Rob Paulsen.|$|R

The Whites try to {{convince}} the Schraders to keep their children out of the situation, but the Schraders refuse to comply; Marie even states bluntly that Walt should kill himself to end it all. As the Whites leave, Walt gives his in-laws a DVD of his [...] "confession."

A stunned Hank then learns that the operation and therapy which made it possible for him to walk again were paid at Walt's expense from Marie's unwitting receipt of his drug money, which Skyler had claimed were [...] "gambling winnings."

40|$|International audienceIn [arXiv: 1411. 3592] an {{extension}} of the Ashtekar-Lewandowski (AL) state space of Loop Quantum Gravity was set up with the help a projective formalism introduced by Kijowski [Kijowski 1977; see also: arXiv: 1304. 6330, arXiv: 1411. 3590]. The motivation for this work was to achieve a more balanced treatment of the position and momentum variables (aka. holonomies and fluxes). Indeed, states in the AL Hilbert spaces describe discrete quantum excitations on top of a vacuum which is an eigenstate of the flux variables (a `no-geometry' state) : in such states, most holonomies are totally spread, making it difficult to approximate a smooth, classical 4 -geometry. However, going beyond the AL sector does not fully resolve this difficulty: one uncovers a deeper issue hindering the construction of states semi-classical with respect to a full set of observables. In the present article, we analyze this issue in the case of real-valued holonomies (we will briefly comment on the heuristic implications for other gauge groups, eg. SU(2)). Specifically, we show that, in this case, there does not exist any state on the holonomy-flux algebra in which the variances of the holonomies and fluxes observables would all be finite, let alone small. It {{is important to note that}} this obstruction cannot be bypassed by further enlarging the quantum state space, for it arises from the structure of the algebra itself: as there are too many (uncountably many) non-vanishing commutators between the holonomy and flux operators, the corresponding <b>Heisenberg</b> inequalities <b>force</b> the quantum uncertainties to blow up uncontrollably. A way out would be to suitably restrict the algebra of observables. In a companion paper we take the first steps in this direction by developing a general framework to perform such a restriction without giving up the universality and diffeomorphism invariance of the theory...|$|R
