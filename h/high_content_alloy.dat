The microstructure of the precipitates were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HREM) and then quantitatively investigated {{with the aid of}} an image analysis.

The results show that the matrix precipitate size distributions of both alloys had significant difference, so as to fatigue crack propagation rates and fracture appearance. The shear and bypass mechanisms of dislocation-precipitate interactions were employed to explain the difference. Among the shearable precipitates, the proportion of larger size precipitates for the <b>higher</b> zinc <b>content</b> <b>alloy</b> is bigger than that for the lower zinc <b>content</b> <b>alloy.</b> The coarse shearable precipitates hinder the propagation of the fatigue cracks, leading to inferior FCP rate.

Oxidation weight change measurement showed that in general, increasing Cr content reduced the oxidation rate. At Cr 25 %, the weight gain became very low due to formation of Cr 2 O 3 layer. Adding 5 %H 2 O to Ar- 20 %O 2 accelerated the oxidation rate of alloys with Cr < 20 %.

Nineteen grades of WC-Co alloys were studied. These alloys had been previously characterised according to microstructural and mechanical properties. Further characterisation by way of Young's modulus and density of the materials was undertaken. An investigation of the i nfluence of various parameters on cavitation erosion established a binder content dependence on erosion.
