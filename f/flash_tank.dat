Multiple-effect evaporators (MEEs) are common to industries that concentrate different products, regenerate solvents,or separate solid-liquid mixtures. Process integration can help to choose the best configuration of MEE {{in order to achieve}} a more efficient process in the sense of energy use. In present work a number of configurations and difficulties of MEE system such as condensate flashing, vapour bleeding, steam splitting, preheating of liquor using condensate, variable physical properties and boiling point rise are taken into consideration to develop different models of evaporation system. In the present work seven effect evaporator system of typical Indian pulp and paper industry is considered for analysis based on above configurations. These systems is described by a set of nonlinear algebraic equations that include total and solute mass balances, energy balances, heat transfer rate equations and the composition and temperature dependence of relevant thermodynamic properties such as vapour pressures and enthalpies.

In general, for every 100 pounds of biodiesel produced, approximately 10 pounds of crude glycerol are produced as a by-product. As the biodiesel industry rapidly expands in the U.

Biodiesel producers should seek an alternative method which is economically and environmentally friendly. This research contains reforming process to covert waste glycerol from a biodiesel industry into sellable hydrogen.

40|$|Dynamic {{simulations}} of vapor compression system {{are an important}} field of research since they allow investigation into {{the behavior of a}} system under time-varying conditions, which is essential for development of an effective control strategy for the system. It is particularly important for advanced cycles such as a <b>flash</b> <b>tank</b> vapor injection (FTVI) cycle since additional control parameters, such as injection vapor temperature or <b>flash</b> <b>tank</b> liquid level, are involved in such systems. In this study, a mathematical model for an R 410 A-based FTVI cycle is developed in Simulink. The model is based on an actual system that consists of two sets of heat exchangers, a high-side EEV, a low-side TXV, a <b>flash</b> <b>tank</b> and a scroll compressor with a vapor injection port The injection port can be turned off or on.

40|$|Because of {{the many}} air-conditioning, refrigeration, and heating {{applications}} that utilize vapor compression equipment, the vapor compression cycle {{has been the focus}} of significant research. The combination of rising energy costs and increasing environmental awareness motivates the development of more efficient cycle components, including higher performance compressors, heat exchangers, and expansion devices for recovering work. However, modifications to the basic vapor compression cycle also show potential for significantly improving cooling cycle performance through increased cooling capacity and COP. ^ The current study investigates the performance improvements that can be achieved through the use of intercooling and economizing. A basic cycle model that uses a compressor with a fixed isentropic efficiency is developed in EES to study these configurations. The model first considers two-stage compression with intercooling between the stages, which does not improve the cooling capacity but provides an increase in COP as a result of decreased compressor work. ^ The basic cycle model considers two different approaches for economizing with two-stage compression. The first approach uses a <b>flash</b> <b>tank</b> to supply saturated vapor to the compressor between the stages. Drawing off the saturated vapor in the <b>flash</b> <b>tank</b> to mix with the first-stage compressor discharge gas not only cools the compression gas, reducing the compression work, but also results in an increased cooling capacity. Therefore, <b>flash</b> <b>tank</b> economization provides a significantly greater improvement in COP compared to intercooling under the same operating conditions. ^ The second approach to economizing uses an intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) to supply two-phase or vaporized refrigerant to the compressor at the intermediate pressure. The IHX achieves results identical to those for <b>flash</b> <b>tank</b> economization if the IHX has an effectiveness of 100 %, but the performance of the system with IHX economizing degrades significantly as the heat exchanger effectiveness decreases. ^ Therefore, the cycle with <b>flash</b> <b>tank</b> economization is selected for further study. The basic cycle model with two-stage compression and <b>flash</b> <b>tank</b> economization is modified to consider an increasing number of injection points and a <b>flash</b> <b>tank</b> that can supply two-phase refrigerant. The decrease in the enthalpy of the injected refrigerant and the increased number of injection ports moves the compression process closer to the liquid-vapor dome and therefore decreases the compression work. The number of injection points is then increased to approach the limiting case of continuous injection, which minimizes the compressor power consumption by maintaining a saturated vapor state in the compressor. ^ To improve the accuracy of these cycle model predictions, two comprehensive compressor models are developed. A thermodynamic model of a two-stage rolling piston compressor is developed with consideration for leakage and heat transfer in the compressor. The compressor model is validated by experimental testing of a prototype two-stage rolling piston, and is then used to study the effect of intercooling on the compressor performance. ^ While the two-stage rolling-piston compressor operates with two separate compression chambers in series, the benefits of staging can also be realized by injecting economized refrigerant through ports in a single-stage rotary compressor. Therefore, a model of a novel rotary spool compressor with refrigerant injection is developed to study the effect of multiple injection ports on compressor and cycle performance. The model without injection is validated through experimental testing of a prototype spool compressor and provides a valuable tool for improving the prototype compressor design. ^ The model is then used to predict the compressor performance with a single injection port while varying the port diameter, port location and injection pressure. For an R- 22 cycle operating with an evaporating temperature of – 7. 2 °C, a suction temperature of 7. 6 °C and a condensing temperature of 48. 8 °C, the model predicts that a single injection port will increase the COP of the basic vapor compression cycle by up to 12 %. Incorporating a second injection port increases the COP of the cycle by 16 % over the baseline value without injection. ...|$|E

40|$|Geothermal {{reservoirs}} may be liquid- or vapor- dominated. Two {{types of}} power cycle {{will be considered}} in this paper for liquid-dominated reservoirs, the vapor flashing cycle and the binary cycle using isobutane as the working fluid. In vapor <b>flashing</b> cycle, <b>flashing</b> <b>tanks</b> are used to separate steam from brine, and the steam expands in turbine to generate power. In binary cycle, the working fluid is superheated by geothermal fluid and then expands in turbine for power generation. Addition of a regenerator to binary cycle improves the thermal efficiency. For identical conditions of geothermal fluid, the power generated by a regenerative binary cycle is slightly {{higher than that of}} basic binary cycle. Another advantage of the regenerative binary cycle is that the heat rejection rate of the system is lowered by using the regenerator. Geothermal fluid from well may exist in two phases, vapor and liquid, if the fluid in well is self-flowing. To avoid scaling, submersible pump may be used to force the fluid out of a well. When pump is used, there will be no vapor at the wellhead. Effects of pumping on power output and heat rejection of binary cycle have been evaluated in Section III. For geothermal fluids with high content of non-condensable gases, a non-condensing plant may be used. Condensing plants have much higher thermal efficiencies than non-condensing plants. If cooling water to condenser is not accessible, a cooling tower can be used to recycle the cooling water.

The purpose of the study was to define the most technically feasible and lowest cost near-term energy conversion process for a 50 MWe geothermal power plant at the Salton Sea known Geothermal Resource Area (KGRA). Using the latest information from the Geothermal Loop Experimental Facility (GLEF), which is currently in operation at the Salton Sea KGRA, conceptual designs, capital cost estimates, and busbar energy production cost estimates were developed for power plants employing several versions of flashed steam and flash binary energy conversion processes. A power plant and well field risk analysis was also performed. The results show that while the flashed steam plant has the advantage of lower plant capital cost, the brine flow rate required by the binary plant is lower. This results in busbar energy production costs for the two plants that are the same. However, the risk analysis indicates that the technical risks are less for the flashed steam further work at the GLEF. The version of the flashed steam process with lowest energy production cost was the dual-flash process with three 50 percent capacity trains of <b>flash</b> <b>tanks</b> with unmodified brine. Thus, it was determined that GLEF testing in the immediate future should be directed primarily toward this process. A series of GLEP tests and further studies were defined for the purpose of alleviating or minimizing the major risks associated with the flash steam process.

40|$|Vapor {{injection}} technique {{has proven to}} be effective in improving heat pump system performance, especially for cooling application at high ambient and heating application at low ambient temperature conditions. Recent research on vapor {{injection technique}} has been mostly focused on the internal heat exchanger cycle and <b>flash</b> <b>tank</b> cycle. The <b>flash</b> <b>tank</b> cycle typically shows better performance than the internal heat exchanger cycle. However, the <b>flash</b> <b>tank</b> cycle control strategy is not yet clearly defined. Improper system control strategy would result in undesirable amount of liquid refrigerant injected to the compressor or poor system performance. In this research work, a novel cycle control strategy for a residential R- 410 A vapor injection <b>flash</b> <b>tank</b> heat pump system was developed and experimentally investigated. The proposed cycle control strategy utilizes an electronic expansion valve (EEV) coupled with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for the upper-stage expansion and a thermostatic expansion valve (TXV) for the lower-stage expansion, and applies a small electric heater in the vapor injection line to introduce superheat to the injected vapor thus providing a control signal to the upper-stage EEV. The proposed control strategy functions effectively for both transient and steady-state operating conditions. As global warming has raised more critical concerns in recent years, refrigerants with high global warming potentials (GWP) are facing the challenges of being phased out. R 410 A, with a GWP of 2, 088, has been widely used in residential air-conditioners and heat pump systems. A potential substitute for R 410 A is R 32, which has a GWP of 675. This research work also investigates the performance difference using R 410 A and R 32 in a vapor-injected heat pump system. A drop-in test was performed using R 32 in a heat pump system that is designed to utilize R 410 A, for both cooling and heating conditions. Through experimentation, it was found that there was improvement for capacity and coefficient of performance (COP) using R 32, as compared to an identical cycle using R 410 A.

5000|$|Battle Group 30 {{began its}} {{attack on the}} town defences but its advance was slowed by minefields and heavy resistance. Reports came in of the {{sighting}} of T-34 tanks from the east. The commander summoned additional anti-tank armour and Battle Group 10 detached Combat Team 2's Ratel-90 troops which were hastily sent to Ongiva, arriving around 13h00. In the meantime they attempted to slow the tanks' advance by attacking them with 120 mm mortars which had had no effect. Combat Team 2 went into action immediately {{but by the time}} action commenced, dusk was falling and they fired only to discourage the tanks advance. As night fell, all that could be seen was the <b>flashes</b> from the <b>tanks</b> and when all the Ratels fired on the position, they succeeded in destroying two tanks and ending further enemy attacks. Battle Group 30 then pulled back and laagered for the night, readying themselves for an attack the next day. On 28 August, Battle Group 30 resumed their attack on Ongiva only to find the FAPLA defences, equipment and town abandoned. By 12h08, Ongiva was under South African control ...|$|R
40|$|Performance of the {{absorption}} cooling system {{is still a}} challenge due to the coefficient of performance (COP) that is generally poor {{when compared with the}} conventional vapor compression cycle. High solar radiation in hot climates is usually associated with high ambient temperature and consequently peak cooling demand. Absorption cooling cycles can be powered by solar but the performance is limited by heat source temperature (solar collector) and high ambient temperature that can affect the condensation process. Efficiency enhancement of the system components is essential to increase the COP of the system. A modification in the combined absorption–ejector cooling system is adopted. Adding a removable <b>flash</b> <b>tank</b> between the condenser and evaporator could improve entrainment ratio of the ejector, along with improving the cooling effect inside the evaporator. A computer simulation program is developed to evaluate the performance of the modified combined cycle using aqua-ammonia (NH 3 –H 2 O) refrigerant. The performance of the proposed combined cooling cycle is compared with basic absorption, and combined absorption–ejector cooling cycles. Results showed a significant improvement in the COP of the modified cycle at different operating conditions. Cooling effect and capacity of the evaporator is enhanced due to the reduction of flash gas delivered to the evaporator. Furthermore, the <b>flash</b> <b>tank</b> optimized the ejector entertainment ratio and consequently increasing the condenser pressure. This optimization will enable the system to perform well in hot climates where the condenser efficiency is limited by ambient temperature...|$|E
40|$|A septuple effect flat falling film {{evaporator}} {{system for the}} concentration of black liquor is studied and a generalized cascade algorithm is developed for the different operating strategies. The amount of live steam consumption in the system is evaluated for the given base case parameters. Then the amount of auxiliary vapour produced due {{to the use of}} one feed <b>flash</b> <b>tank</b> and seven condensate flash tanks was determined. It was found that the presence of flash tanks helps in recovering heat from the used vapour and thereby reduces the overall live steam consumption of the system and improves the overall steam economy of the system. Thus it helps in making the system more economical...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made to}} determine the magnitude and location of the reactor coolant system leakage of the Shippingport Power Beactor. The "total" plant leakage was indicated by the pressurizer level change since no make-up was added during the test. The "accounted for" leakage was indicated by the <b>flash</b> <b>tank</b> level change and the blowoff tank level change. The relief valves from the pressurizer and reactor were checked for leakage individrually and a combined leakage of 2. 84 gal/hr was obtainsd for the 6 valves tested.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Previous {{studies of}} six Oregon {{public water supply}} systems {{revealed}} that greater proportions of the standard plate count (SPC) bacteria from distribution waters were multiple antibiotic resistant (MAR) compared to isolates from the corresponding source raw waters. In the present study, two of these water systems were examined further to determine the possible role that metal tolerance has {{in the selection of}} MAR bacteria. The first drinking water system examined serves an Oregon coastal resort community. A total of 216 distribution water and 177 raw water isolates were tested for resistance to five antibiotics (chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfanilamide, and tetracycline), tolerance to six metals (as salts, Al₂(SO₄) ₃, CdC 1 ₂, CuC 1 ₂, Pb(NO₃) ₂, SnC 1 ₂, and ZnC 1 ₂), and were identified. Statistically significant associations between multiple antibiotic resistance and tolerance to Cu²⁺, Pb²⁺, and Zn ²⁺ were found among distribution water isolates but not raw water isolates. Significantly greater proportions of the raw water isolates were tolerant to A 1 ³⁺ and Sn²⁺ and were not typically MAR. Tolerance to Cd²⁺ was not associated with the isolates from either water type or with multiple antibiotic resistance. Characteristic patterns of antibiotic resistance and metal tolerance were associated with various taxonomic genera and groups. Of the taxonomic types that were isolated from both raw and distribution waters, greater proportions of the distribution water isolates were resistant to more antibiotics and tolerant to more metals. Resistance to kanamycin and tolerance to Cu²⁺, Pb²⁺, and Zn²⁺ was typical among the distribution but not raw water Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, and Pseudomonas and Alcaligenes groups. The association of multiple antibiotic resistance with tolerance to Cu²⁺, Pb²⁺, and Zn²⁺ was significantly more prevalent among the isolates from {{near the end of the}} distribution system while the isolates from near the origin of the system typically expressed phenotypes more similar to those of the raw water isolates. To determine the impact of water treatment and distribution in the selection of MAR and MMT (multiple metal tolerant) SPC bacteria, a drinking water system serving an Oregon community of 40, 000 was studied. On four dates, samples were obtained from the source water, treatment waters, distribution waters, and inner surfaces of water pipes. A total of 730 river, 290 <b>flash</b> mix <b>tank,</b> 359 clear well, 629 distribution water, and 298 pipe surface isolates were identified and tested for resistance to the isolates. Significantly greater proportions of the raw water isolates were tolerant to A 1 ³⁺ and Sn²⁺ and were not typically MAR.

Results indicated increases in the incidence of MAR and MMT bacteria when comparing river, treatment plant, and distribution water and pipe surface SPC populations. Distribution water isolates and isolates from inner pipe surfaces exhibited much greater associations of metal tolerance with multiple antibiotic resistance as compared to river isolates or treatment plant isolates. Pipe surface materials were shown to contain high concentrations of metals and large numbers of viable bacteria. The predominant metal tolerance phenotypes of these organisms reflected the metals present, since the copper pipe sample had a high level of Cu²⁺ tolerant bacteria while the galvanized iron pipe samples contained many Zn²⁺ tolerant bacteria. Similarities in taxonomic groups as well as in antibiotic and metal resistance patterns were observed in distribution water isolates and in bacteria from inner pipe surfaces. This suggested that bacteria colonizing pipe surfaces are shed into flowing distribution water...|$|R
40|$|Emissions of {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) associated with {{oil and natural gas}} production in the Uintah Basin, Utah were measured at a ground site in Horse Pool and from a NOAA mobile laboratory with PTR-MS instruments. The VOC compositions in the vicinity of individual gas and oil wells and other point sources such as evaporation ponds, compressor stations and injection wells are compared to the measurements at Horse Pool. High mixing ratios of aromatics, alkanes, cycloalkanes and methanol were observed for extended periods of time and for short-term spikes caused by local point sources. The mixing ratios during the time the mobile laboratory spent on the well pads were averaged. High mixing ratios were found close to all point sources, but gas well pads with collection and dehydration on the well pad were clearly associated with higher mixing ratios than other wells. The comparison of the VOC composition of the emissions from the oil and natural gas well pads showed that gas well pads without dehydration on the well pad compared well with the majority of the data at Horse Pool, and that oil well pads compared well {{with the rest of the}} ground site data. Oil well pads on average emit heavier compounds than gas well pads. The mobile laboratory measurements confirm the results from an emissions inventory: the main VOC source categories from individual point sources are dehydrators, oil and condensate <b>tank</b> <b>flashing</b> and pneumatic devices and pumps. Raw natural gas is emitted from the pneumatic devices and pumps and heavier VOC mixes from the tank flashings...|$|R
