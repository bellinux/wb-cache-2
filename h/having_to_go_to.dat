5|$|Celtic faced Yugoslavia (now Serbian) side Vojvodina Novi Sad in the quarter-finals, {{and lost}} {{the first leg}} 1–0 after a goal from Milan Stanić; this was Celtic's only defeat of the competition. The tie {{looked like it was}} going to end in a draw after Chalmers had given Celtic a 1–0 lead in the second leg. This would have {{resulted}} in the teams from <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Rotterdam for a replay. However, in the 90th minute captain Billy McNeill scored to give Celtic the victory. In the semi-finals, Czechoslovakian side Dukla Prague were beaten 3–1 in Glasgow, Johnstone put the hosts in front, before Stanislav Štrunc equalised. A second half brace from Willie Wallace gave Celtic the victory. The teams then drew 0–0 in Prague, which meant Celtic progressed to the final.|$|E

25|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} a disease of old age: It {{typically}} originates in the secretory cells lining the gut, and risk factors include diets low in vegetable fibre and high in fat. If a younger person gets such a cancer, it {{is often associated with}} hereditary syndromes like Peutz-Jegher's, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or familial adenomatous polyposis. Colorectal cancer can be detected through the bleeding of a polyp, colicky bowel pain, a bowel obstruction or the biopsy of a polyp at a screening colonoscopy. A constant feeling of <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the toilet or anemia might also point to this kind of cancer.|$|E

25|$|Emily {{attended}} the University of Deseret. For a time, {{she was a}} school teacher. In 1883, Grant asked Emily to marry him. Since she had not renounced her dislike for polygamy and he was already married to Lucy, that {{was in many ways}} a very daring move on his part, and she initially declined his request. Emily then {{had a change of heart}} and she and Grant married on May 27, 1884. Since the Edmunds Act had been enacted in 1882, the situation of Mormon polygamists was far worse than it had been a decade earlier when Emily had first renounced polygamy. To avoid Grant <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> prison on charges of unlawful cohabitation, Emily went to England to live at the LDS mission home to have her first child. She returned to the United States 16 months later and moved between multiple locations in Utah Territory and Idaho to avoid capture.|$|E

Despite O'Brien and other production staff being sure that Rickles would appear in the episode, he was reportedly upset by {{the concept of the}} storyline, as he did not wish to be portrayed as a [...] "mean guy".|$|E

500|$|The imitating {{species is}} called the mimic, while the imitated species (protected by its toxicity, foul taste or other defenses) {{is known as the}} model. The predatory species {{mediating}} indirect interactions between the mimic and the model is variously known as the [...] receiver, dupe or operator. By parasitizing the honest warning signal of the model, the Batesian mimic gains an advantage, without <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the expense of arming itself. The model, on the other hand, is disadvantaged, along with the dupe. If impostors appear in high numbers, positive experiences with the mimic may result in the model being treated as harmless. At higher frequency there is also a stronger selective advantage for the predator to distinguish mimic from model. For this reason, mimics are usually less numerous than models, an instance of frequency dependent selection. Some mimetic populations have evolved multiple forms (polymorphism), enabling them to mimic several different models and thereby to gain greater protection. Batesian mimicry is not always perfect. A variety of explanations have been proposed for this, including limitations in predators' cognition.|$|E
500|$|The first parody {{recorded}} for {{the album was}} [...] "Cavity Search", a parody of U2's hit [...] "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me". The song, which recounts the horror of <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the dentist, features {{the sound of an}} actual dental drill. To enhance the dental theme of the song, Yankovic called in his actual dentist, who brought a real drill and a human tooth, which the two took turns drilling while recording to create a genuine sound effect. The second parody was a pastiche of TLC's hit [...] "Waterfalls" [...] called [...] "Phony Calls", about prank calls. During the bridge, a clip from The Simpsons second season episode [...] "Blood Feud" [...] is played on top of the music. Because the sound clip was from a preexisting episode, Yankovic noted that [...] "it was a pretty sweet deal for the Simpsons' voice actors – they each got a nice pile of money, and they didn't even have to come to the studio!" [...] The next parody {{recorded for}} the album was [...] "Gump", a parody of [...] "Lump" [...] by The Presidents of the United States of America. The song recounts the basic plot to the 1994 film Forrest Gump about a naïve and slow-witted yet athletically prodigious native of Alabama who witnesses, and in some cases influences, some of the defining events of {{the latter half of the}} 20th century in the United States. [...] "Gump" [...] was released as the second single from the album, and received a video.|$|E

2500|$|Ascom B8050, usually {{known by}} the name QuickFare, is an early example of a passenger-operated railway ticket issuing system, {{consisting}} {{of a series of}} broadly identical machines installed at British railway stations from 1989 onwards. [...] The machines allow passengers to buy the most popular types of ticket themselves, without <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a booking office, and are therefore useful at unstaffed, partly staffed or busy stations.

Integrated Master of Science programs are also offered at few IITs which integrates the Undergraduate and Postgraduate studies in Science streams in a single degree program against the conventional University system.

2500|$|The tunnel was {{the most}} easterly land {{connection}} {{between the north and}} south banks of the Thames, close to the docks on both banks of the river, and was not far from mainline railways at either end. Converting the tunnel for railway use thus offered a means of providing a cross-Thames rail link without <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the expense of boring a new tunnel. On 25 September 1865 the East London Railway Company took ownership of the tunnel at a cost of £800,000. Over the next four years the company built a railway through the tunnel to connect with the existing lines. The company's engineer was Sir John Hawkshaw, who was also responsible for the major re-design and completion of I K Brunel's long-abandoned Clifton Suspension Bridge at Bristol.|$|E
2500|$|Clayton's bass guitar {{was heavily}} processed, {{to the point}} that it sounded like a {{keyboard}} bass (an instrument utilized on [...] "Mofo"). The Edge wanted to steer away from the image he had since the 1980s as having an echo-heavy guitar sound. As a result, he was enthusiastic about experimenting with his guitar's sound, hence the distorted guitar sounds on the album, achieved with a variety of effects pedals, synthesisers and knob twiddling. Bono was very determined to avoid the vocal style present on previous (especially 1980s) albums, characterized by pathos, rich timbre, a sometimes theatrical quality and his use of falsetto singing: instead he opted for a rougher, more nervous and less timbre-laden style. The production team made his voice sound more intimate, as up-front and raw as possible. As Flood explained, [...] "You get his emotional involvement with the songs through the lyrics and the way he reacts to the music—without him <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> 11 all the time... We only used extreme effects on his voice during the recording, for him to get himself into a different place, and then, gradually, we pulled most effects out." ...|$|E

The car struck a wall, {{splitting}} the car in half and ejecting him and his passenger, teammate Dan Snyder. Heatley suffered a broken jaw, a minor concussion, a bruised lung and a bruised kidney, and he tore three ligaments in his right knee; Snyder was critically injured, with a skull fracture, and died six days later, on October 5, of sepsis. Heatley was charged with vehicular homicide; he pleaded guilty to second-degree vehicular homicide, driving too fast for conditions, failure to maintain a lane and speeding. He admitted to drinking prior to the incident, but his blood-alcohol content was below the legal limit. He was sentenced to three years probation, and the judge, Rowland W. Barnes (the same judge later murdered by Brian Nichols in 2005), required the court to approve Heatley's vehicle, which could not have more than six cylinders and would not surpass 70mph (112km/h). [...] Heatley avoided <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> trial as part of a plea deal that dropped the first-degree charge of vehicular homicide.|$|E
