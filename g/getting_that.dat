A thrown sticky bomb simply would not reliably stick to a vertical surface. However, the bomb would stick if it was thrown onto {{the top of a}} tank where the plates were more or less horizontal – and thinner – but this reduced the throwing range to twenty yards at the most – <b>getting</b> <b>that</b> close would only be possible in an ambush or in street fighting.|$|E
5|$|Stevens {{introduced}} a Tenure of Office Act, restricting Johnson from firing officials {{who had received}} Senate confirmation without <b>getting</b> <b>that</b> body's consent. The Tenure of Office Act was ambiguous, since it could be read to protect officeholders only during the tenure of the president who appointed them, {{and most of the}} officials the radicals sought to protect had been named by Lincoln. Chief among these was Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a radical himself.|$|E

It's really just about it being toxic, and they're on this drug trip and that definitely plays a part, but I think it's also about being triumphant over those weaknesses, and she leaves him. It's not trying to glorify that type of relationship. The bad parts of it, that's what you don't want. In the end, her leaving, it represents her <b>getting</b> <b>that</b> out of her life.

5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} start {{painting}} her mural in the warehouse, {{but has a}} hard time getting started as she is afraid of it not being perfect. Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the complaints are already in the computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses them to build a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper meaning for the employees when Pete points out that it is composed of failures made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that they should not be ashamed of their failures. They decide {{to try to make it}} go all the way to the ceiling, but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a blank card as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and hangs up. The client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over <b>getting</b> <b>that</b> last complaint and disappointed over losing a client. After celebrating the completion of the card tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what others think, further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E
25|$|In mid-August, {{four months}} into his Florida sojourn, Ben {{returned}} to Tennessee for a week. His parents and girlfriend, Emily Greer, said he seemed optimistic. He {{told them he}} was working on getting certified as an instructor so he could find a job and that he was researching cave diving with an eye toward <b>getting</b> <b>that</b> certification as well. On his nights out with Greer, he told her of plans to eventually start a diving-related business. On the weekend of August 14–15, he returned to Florida, leaving behind a letter thanking his parents for the sabbatical and promising to look after them as they grew older. They never saw him again.|$|E
25|$|Maloney {{left the}} club {{at the end}} of the 2002 season but his {{replacement}} proved to be a key in Glory finally <b>getting</b> <b>that</b> elusive title. German midfielder Andre Gumprecht was brought into the club thanks to Stange and made an instant impact. With the NSL disintegrating around them, Glory and Olympic were the only two semi-decent teams still left in the league to galvanise their midfield and fought it out for top spot all season. Glory missed out on the league title, finishing one point behind Olympic. In March 2003, the NSL stripped the club of three points after ruling that Gumprecht had been played before he had been registered. Glory picked up Socceroo Simon Colosimo halfway through the season and eventually won the right to host the 2003 Grand Final after coming out on top of a new, confusing and convoluted league table finals format that had dragged a poor season out. In the Grand Final Glory took the game to Olympic and following a headed goal from in the first half from Harnwell it was all over late in the match when Mori saw his shot dribble over the line in dramatic fashion. 2–0 was the end result and d'Avray had delivered the Grand Final victory Glory had yearned for.|$|E

3000|$|If {{the above}} {{algorithm}} does not finish at finite step, {{then it must}} produce an infinite sub-rectangle iteration sequence {X^k}, from the exhaustiveness of division approach, we <b>get</b> <b>that</b> the sub-rectangle sequence {X^k} must converge to a point. From the characteristics of our algorithm, we can <b>get</b> <b>that</b> {UB_k} and {LB_k} are nonincreasing and nondecreasing sequences, respectively. So that {UB_k-LB_k} is a monotonic non-increasing sequence. By the conclusion of Theorem  1, we <b>get</b> <b>that</b> the sequence {UB_k-LB_k} must be convergent to zero. From the structure of our algorithm, for each k, we have LB_k< v^*< UB_k. Therefore, we can <b>get</b> <b>that</b> [...] _k→∞UB_k= _k→∞LB_k=v^*. From steps of our algorithm, we know that x^k is always a feasible point of the initial NQCQP, we can get UB_k=G_ 0 (x^k). By the continuity of constrained functions, we <b>get</b> <b>that</b> the limitation point x^* of {x^k} is also a feasible point of the initial NQCQP, {{and we can get}} the global optimum value v^*=G_ 0 (x^*). Hence, the conclusion is proved.|$|R
500|$|Miller had {{a strong}} {{reputation}} with fellow musicians. Pianist Geoffrey Keezer was convinced {{that he wanted to}} be a pianist after attending a performance by Miller in 1986. Vibraphonist Warren Wolf stated that Miller helped him early in his career, including by being a link to jazz history: [...] "you're <b>getting</b> <b>that</b> experience of playing with Art Blakey, that attitude of 'Yes, it's my band, but you have to give other people a chance to shine.'" [...] Robert Glasper also cited Miller as an influence, and wrote and recorded [...] "One for 'Grew" [...] as a tribute.|$|E
500|$|Provisionally {{known as}} the Thunderbolt, the Shelby {{prototype}} was more polished than the Miles version, and used a Ford 4-speed manual transmission. The Ford V8 was only 3.5 inches longer than the Alpine's 4-cylinder engine it replaced, so the primary concern was the engine's width. Like Miles, Shelby found that the Ford V8 would only just fit into the Alpine engine bay: [...] "I {{think that if the}} figure of speech about the shoehorn ever applied to anything, it surely did to the tight squeak in <b>getting</b> <b>that</b> 260 Ford mill into the Sunbeam engine compartment. There was a place for everything and a space for everything, but positively not an inch to spare." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review of the episode, [...] "Some {{sluggish}} stories took better turns this week – albeit sometimes by just ending things for now – while a book character many thought would never appear on the series made a notable splash, answering a big mystery that the novels hadn’t even revealed yet in the process. There were some great moments in [...] "Blood of My Blood", but mostly the big returns {{made it possible to}} salivate for the payoffs (and possible characters) to come." [...] He also continued by noting, [...] "this installment probably speaks, more than any other episode so far this season, to the accelerated rate of payoffs we're now <b>getting</b> <b>that</b> the show isn't directly following the books." [...] Fowler gave the episode an 8.6 out of 10. Laura Prudom of Variety also praised the pacing of the episode as well as the season's payoffs, writing [...] "There's a clarity of purpose in Season 6 that certainly gives the impression that we're barreling towards a conclusion instead of just meandering through Dorne or killing time in Qarth." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Puppy Episode" [...] and DeGeneres's {{attendant}} {{coming out}} generated enormous publicity {{before the show}} aired. Right-wing groups like the American Family Association pressured ABC to drop the storyline and Ellen sponsors not to advertise; two occasional advertisers, J. C. Penney and Chrysler, decided not to buy time during the episode. Another sponsor, Wendy's, decided not to advertise on Ellen again at all. Despite these losses of potential advertisers, ABC turned away ads from two LGBT-oriented sponsors, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and lesbian vacation company Olivia Cruises. Jerry Falwell called DeGeneres [...] "Ellen Degenerate", to which DeGeneres responded, [...] "I've been <b>getting</b> <b>that</b> since the fourth grade. I guess I'm happy I could give him work." [...] GLAAD organized [...] "Come Out With Ellen" [...] house parties across the United States and HRC created [...] "Ellen Coming Out House Party" [...] kits that included invitations, posters and an Ellen trivia game. HRC had initially planned to send out about 300 kits. Deluged with requests, they ended up sending out about 3,000. ABC affiliate WBMA-LP in Birmingham, Alabama, citing [...] "family values", first sought ABC's permission to move the episode out of prime-time to a late-night slot. When ABC declined the request, the affiliate refused to air the episode at all. Local LGBT organization Pride Birmingham arranged for a satellite feed of the episode and rented a 5,000-seat theatre for a viewing party, with about 1,000 people attending. Local activists circulated a petition requesting that Abilene, Texas-area affiliate KTXS-TV not air the episode but were unsuccessful.|$|E
