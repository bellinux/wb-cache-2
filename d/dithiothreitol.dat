50|$|Cleland {{was well}} known for being the first to utilize <b>dithiothreitol</b> for the {{reduction}} of disulfide bonds in proteins. The compound is therefore often called Cleland's reagent. His research interests focus {{on the use of}} enzyme kinetics to deduce enzyme mechanisms, primarily those mechanisms involved in phosphoryl and acyl transfers. He was a pioneer in the kinetic and mechanistic study of enzymes that utilize more than one substrate.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{inhibitor}} of PPO, those competitive to oxygen in the copper site of the enzyme and those competitive to phenolics. Tentoxin has also been used in recent research to eliminate the PPO activity from seedlings of higher plants. Tropolone is a grape polyphenol oxidase inhibitor. Another inhibitor of this enzyme is potassium pyrosulphite (K2S2O5). Banana root PPO is strongly inhibited by <b>dithiothreitol</b> and sodium metabisulfite.|$|E
5000|$|Compared to {{the other}} two most common agents used for this purpose (<b>dithiothreitol</b> and β-mercaptoethanol), TCEP has the {{advantages}} of being odorless, a more powerful reducing agent, an irreversible reducing agent (in the sense that TCEP does not regenerate—the end product of TCEP-mediated disulfide cleavage is in fact two free thiols/cysteines), more hydrophilic, and more resistant to oxidation in air. [...] It also does not reduce metals used in immobilized metal affinity chromatography.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dithiothreitol</b> (DTT) is {{the common}} name for a small-molecule redox reagent also known as Cleland's reagent. DTT's formula is C4H10O2S2 and the {{chemical}} structure {{of one of its}} enantiomers in its reduced form is shown on the right; its oxidized form is a disulfide bonded 6-membered ring (shown below). The reagent is commonly used in its racemic form, as both enantiomers are reactive. Its name derives from the four-carbon sugar, threose. DTT has an epimeric ('sister') compound, dithioerythritol (DTE).|$|E

50|$|By {{breaking}} the S-S bonds, both the tertiary {{structure and the}} quaternary structure of some proteins can be disrupted. Because {{of its ability to}} disrupt the structure of proteins, it was used in the analysis of proteins, for instance, to ensure that a protein solution contains monomeric protein molecules, instead of disulfide linked dimers or higher order oligomers. However, since 2-mercaptoethanol forms adducts with free cysteines and is somewhat more toxic, <b>dithiothreitol</b> (DTT) is generally more used especially in SDS-PAGE. DTT is also a more powerful reducing agent with a redox potential (at pH 7) of −0.33 V, compared to −0.26 V for 2-mercaptoethanol.|$|E
50|$|The {{staining}} and destaining of gels {{is often}} {{followed by the}} reduction and alkylation (r&a) of the cystines or cysteines in the proteins. Hereby, the disulfide bonds of the proteins are irreversibly broken up and the optimal unfolding of the tertiary structure is obtained. The reduction to the thiol is accomplished by the reaction with chemicals containing sulfhydryl or phosphine groups such as <b>dithiothreitol</b> (DTT) or tris-2-carboxyethylphosphine hydrochloride (TCEP). In course of the subsequent irreversible alkylation of the SH groups with iodoacetamide the cysteines are transformed to the stable S-carboxyamidomethylcysteine (CAM; adduct: -CH2-CONH2). The molecular weight of the cysteine amino-acid residue is thereby increased from 103.01 Da to 160.03 Da.|$|E
50|$|After {{determining}} that sperm cells are present (typically through staining and light microscopy) in a vaginal/rectal sample, the subject's epithelial cells are lysed by a standard DNA extraction method, like a phenol/chloroform extraction and their DNA extracted through normal means. The epithelial DNA in solution is removed and saved, while the sperm cells are still intact. Differential extraction uses a chemical called <b>dithiothreitol</b> (DTT) {{to disrupt the}} sulfur bonds in the coating of the sperm cell in order to extract its DNA. Once the sperm's outer membrane has been breached, it is prone to standard DNA extraction methods. This creates two different DNA fractions from one sample, hopefully that of the victim {{and that of the}} perpetrator.|$|E
5000|$|Daratumumab {{can also}} bind to CD38 present on {{red blood cells}} and {{interfere}} with routine testing for clinically significant antibodies. Patients will show a panreactive antibody panel, including a positive auto-control, which tends to mask the presence of any clinically significant antibodies. Treatment of the antibody panel cells with <b>dithiothreitol</b> (DTT) and repeating testing will effectively negate the binding of daratumumab to CD38 on the red blood cell surface; however, DTT also inactivates/destroys many antigens on the red blood cell surface by disrupting disulfide bonds. Fortunately, the only antigen system affected {{that is associated with}} common, clinically significant antibodies is Kell, making crossmatch testing with K-negative RBCs a reasonable alternative when urgent transfusion is indicated.|$|E
50|$|Thiol-disulfide {{exchange}} {{is the principal}} reaction by which disulfide bonds are formed and rearranged in a protein. The rearrangement of disulfide bonds within a protein generally occurs via intra-protein thiol-disulfide exchange reactions; a thiolate group of a cysteine residue attacks one of the protein's own disulfide bonds. This process of disulfide rearrangement (known as disulfide shuffling) {{does not change the}} number of disulfide bonds within a protein, merely their location (i.e., which cysteines are bonded). Disulfide reshuffling is generally much faster than oxidation/reduction reactions, which change the number of disulfide bonds within a protein. The oxidation and reduction of protein disulfide bonds in vitro also generally occurs via thiol-disulfide exchange reactions. Typically, the thiolate of a redox reagent such as glutathione or <b>dithiothreitol</b> attacks the disulfide bond on a protein forming a mixed disulfide bond between the protein and the reagent. This mixed disulfide bond when attacked by another thiolate from the reagent, leaves the cysteine oxidized. In effect, the disulfide bond is transferred from the protein to the reagent in two steps, both thiol-disulfide exchange reactions.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>dithiothreitol</b> on basal glucose oxidation, hormone-induced lipolysis and insulin receptors in {{isolated}} rat adipocytes were studied. <b>Dithiothreitol</b> produced a dose-dependent stimulation of basal glucose oxidation and inhibition of adrenaline-induced lipolysis. <b>Dithiothreitol</b> also inhibited corticotropin-induced lipolysis, {{but failed to}} inhibit dibutyryl cyclic AMP-induced lipolysis. <b>Dithiothreitol</b> did not inhibit the binding of the beta-adrenergic antagonist [3 H]dihydroalprenolol to adipocytes. Neither catalase (100 micrograms/ml) nor EDTA (2 mM) abolished the antilipolytic effect of <b>dithiothreitol.</b> Treatment of isolated adipocytes with 1 mM-dithiothreitol for 20 min at 37 degrees C also caused stimulation of basal glucose oxidation and inhibition of adrenaline-induced lipolysis. A Scatchard plot of insulin binding to control adipocytes was curvilinear. However, treatment of cells with 1 mM-dithiothreitol decreased the curvilinearity of the plot, indicating that only a low-affinity state of the insulin receptors exists in the dithiothreitol-treated adipocytes. These {{findings suggest that the}} insulin-like activities of <b>dithiothreitol</b> are mediated through the interaction of <b>dithiothreitol</b> with insulin receptors...|$|E
40|$|In this ultrastructural study, monomeric ferritin-insulin {{was used}} to further {{elucidate}} the role of disulfide bonds in maintaining the natural groups of insulin receptors on adipocyte plasma membranes. <b>Dithiothreitol</b> (1 mM) caused partial disruption of the occupied receptor groups {{with an increase in}} single receptors to greater than 50 % of total occupied receptors. N-Ethylmaleimide (1 mM) disrupted the groups to the same extent as <b>dithiothreitol</b> and the effect was partly additive with the <b>dithiothreitol</b> effect. The magnitude of the disruption caused by <b>dithiothreitol</b> or N-ethylmaleimide was similar to that caused by cytochalasin B. <b>Dithiothreitol,</b> a reducing agent, caused a marked increase in binding of insulin to the plasma membranes while N-ethylmaleimide and cytochalasin B, both thiol reagents, had little if any effect on insulin binding. These data suggest that two different sets of disulfide bonds are involved. One set was susceptible to both reducing and thiol reagents and responsible for holding the receptor groups together, and the other set was susceptible to reducing agents only and related to the increased insulin binding caused by <b>dithiothreitol.</b> A proposed model is discussed...|$|E
