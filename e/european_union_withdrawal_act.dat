50|$|After a {{court case}} the {{government}} introduced a bill that was passed as the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> <b>Act</b> 2017.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a direct}} {{consequence}} of the Supreme Court ruling the House of Commons voted by a majority of 384 votes (498 to 114) to approve the second reading of the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> <b>Act</b> 2017 to allow the Prime Minister to invoke Article 50 unconditionally.|$|R
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> <b>Act</b> 2017 (c. 9) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{to empower}} the Prime Minister {{to give to}} the Council of the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> the formal notice - {{required}} by Article 50 of the Treaty on <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> - for starting negotiations for the United Kingdom's <b>withdrawal</b> from the <b>European</b> <b>Union.</b>|$|R
50|$|After a {{referendum}} on the United Kingdom's membership of the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> in June 2016 supported exiting the <b>European</b> <b>Union,</b> the Prime Minister Theresa May announced in October 2016 that Britain would invoke Article 50 by the end of March 2017. After the Supreme Court's ruling in Miller's case, followed by the passing of the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> <b>Act</b> 2017, the prime minister sent the notification letter invoking Article 50 on 29 March 2017.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> <b>Act</b> 2017 {{was passed}} in March 2017, the terms of Britain's {{disengagement}} were unknown. The outlook was uncertain for patent protection of innovation and for the future funding of scientific research, and opinions differed on whether {{scientific research and development}} would be affected by a loss of mobility and international collaboration, or whether Britain's <b>withdrawal</b> from the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (EU) should be seen as an opportunity to expand scientific collaboration.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Prime Minister may notify, under Article 50(2)of the Treaty on <b>European</b> <b>Union,</b> the United Kingdom's {{intention}} {{to withdraw from}} the EU." [...] Clause 1(1) of the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> <b>Act</b> 2017, as introduced on 26 January 2017 https://services.parliament.uk/bills/2016-17/europeanunionnotificationofwithdrawal/documents.html [...] "Any Member State may decide {{to withdraw from the}} Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements." [...] Article 50(1) of the Treaty on <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (TEU), as amended (Treaty of Maastricht, as amended by the Treaty of Lisbon) ...|$|R
50|$|After the government's {{plan to use}} the Royal {{prerogative}} (i.e., to {{give notice}} without explicit Parliamentary authority) was defeated in a court case, Parliament passed the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> <b>Act</b> 2017, empowering the Prime Minister to invoke Article 50. The notification of withdrawal by a member state starts a negotiation period that is limited to two years, unless extended {{with the consent of}} all EU member states. Arising from the Act, the UK Government formally triggered Article 50 on 29 March 2017.|$|R
5000|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled in}} the Miller case in January 2017 that the {{government}} needed parliamentary approval to trigger Article 50. [...] After the House of Commons overwhelmingly voted, on 1 February 2017, for the government's bill authorising the prime minister to invoke Article 50, the bill passed into law as the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> <b>Act</b> 2017. Theresa May signed the letter invoking Article 50 on 28 March 2017, which was delivered on 29 March by Tim Barrow, the UK's ambassador to the EU, to Donald Tusk.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2016 the Conservative Prime Minister, Theresa May, {{announced}} that Article 50 would be invoked by [...] "the {{first quarter of}} 2017". On 24 January 2017 the Supreme Court ruled in the Miller case by a majority that the process could not be initiated without an authorising act of parliament, but unanimously ruled against the Scottish government's claim in respect of devolution {{that they had a}} direct say in the decision to trigger Article 50. Consequently the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> <b>Act</b> 2017 empowering the prime minister to invoke Article 50 was passed and enacted by royal assent in March 2017.|$|R
50|$|After the government's {{appeal was}} dismissed, the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU {{formally}} introduced in parliament, on 26 January 2017, a bill that, on 16 March, was enacted without amendment as the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> <b>Act</b> 2017. The act's long title is To Confer {{power on the}} Prime Minister to notify, under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on <b>European</b> <b>Union,</b> the United Kingdom's intention {{to withdraw from the}} EU. The act's two sections are to confer on the Prime Minister the power of giving the notice that the Treaty requires to be given when a member state decides to withdraw.|$|R
5000|$|The {{process of}} leaving the EU was {{initiated}} by a referendum held in June 2016 which favoured British withdrawal from the EU. In October 2016 the Prime Minister of the UK, Theresa May, announced that Article 50 would be invoked by [...] "the first quarter of 2017". On 24 January 2017 the Supreme Court ruled in the Miller case by a majority that the process could not be initiated without an authorising act of parliament, and unanimously ruled against the Scottish government's claim in respect of devolution. Consequently the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> <b>Act</b> 2017 empowering the prime minister to invoke Article 50 was enacted in March 2017.|$|R
40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> <b>Act</b> 2017 {{authorised}} the Prime Minister to {{give notice}} under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty of the UK’s intention {{to withdraw from}} the EU. The Act was adopted in response to R (Miller and Dos Santos) v Secretary of State for Exiting the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> [2017] UKSC 5, in which the Supreme Court held, by majority, that the royal prerogative did not authorise the Government {{to begin the process of}} withdrawal from the EU Treaties. The House of Commons resisted attempts by the House of Lords to include conditions concerning the status of EU nationals and requiring subsequent parliamentary approval. Parliament’s refusal to limit the Government’s power to begin withdrawal from the EU was foreseeable – indeed it was foreseen by Lord Carnwath in his dissent in Miller (at [273]) – in light of the resolution of the House of Commons on 7 December 2016, the third day of the Supreme Court hearing, confirming the House’s support for the Government to trigger Article 50 by 31 March 2017. Not that the litigation was futile. The Supreme Court’s judgment raised the political cost of triggering Article 50, empowering the House of Lords and providing an occasion to oppose withdrawal and/or to propose conditions on notification or withdrawal. It is arguable that the Government ought in any case – quite apart from the law – to have invited the Houses of Parliament to signify their support for triggering Article 50, whether by way of resolutions in each House or by primary legislation. The Constitution Committee of the House of Lords argued as much in its report The Invoking of Article 50 (HL Paper 44, 13 September 2016) and there is much to be said for it. </p...|$|R
50|$|On 13 July 2017, Secretary of State for Exiting the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> David Davis {{introduced}} the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (<b>Withdrawal)</b> Bill which would repeal the 1972 Act.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{referendum}} on the United Kingdom's membership of the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> on 23 June 2016 {{which resulted in a}} majority vote in favour of leaving the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> it is proposed that this act will be repealed by the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (<b>Withdrawal)</b> Bill 2017-19 with the 2014 European Parliament election being the last to be held under the legislation.|$|R
50|$|The {{position}} {{was created by}} Prime Minister Theresa May, shortly after she took office on 13 July 2016. The purpose behind this new role follows {{the result of the}} 2016 <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> membership referendum on 23 June 2016, in which 51.9% of voters voted in favour of leaving the <b>European</b> <b>Union.</b> <b>Withdrawal</b> from the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> will require new trade agreements to be formed.|$|R
5000|$|Davies' mayoral {{campaign}} {{had called for}} harsher punishments for [...] "young thugs", <b>withdrawal</b> from the <b>European</b> <b>Union,</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of council translation services, {{a reduction in the}} number of Doncaster councillors, and for local schools to opt out of local authority control. Once elected, Davies was interviewed on BBC Radio Sheffield and Look North where the interviewers questioned the legality and achievability of his manifesto promises.|$|R
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (<b>Withdrawal)</b> Bill, {{also known}} as the Repeal Bill or the Great Repeal Bill, is a bill of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that proposes to {{transpose}} directly-applicable <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> law into the law of the United Kingdom, as part of the country’s exit from the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Brexit). To implement this, the proposed bill will repeal the European Communities Act 1972 which first brought the UK into what became the EU, incorporate all EU law into the UK statute books, and give ministers the power to adapt and remove laws that are no longer relevant.|$|R
50|$|A report {{published}} in March 2017 by the Institute for Government commented that, {{in addition to}} the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (<b>Withdrawal)</b> bill, primary and secondary legislation will be needed to cover the gaps in policy areas such as customs, immigration and agriculture. The report also commented that the role of the devolved legislatures was unclear, and could cause problems, and as many as fifteen new additional Brexit Bills may be required, which would involve strict prioritisation and limiting Parliamentary time for in-depth examination of new legislation.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2016, Theresa May {{promised a}} [...] "Great Repeal Bill", which would repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and restate in UK law all enactments {{previously}} in force under EU law. Subsequently renamed the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (<b>Withdrawal)</b> bill, {{it was introduced}} to the House of Commons on 13 July 2017. The bill will not come into force until the date of exit, and aims to smooth the transition by ensuring that all laws remain in force until specifically repealed. The bill has raised constitutional issues regarding the devolution settlements with the UK nations, particularly in Scotland.|$|R
5000|$|The United Kingdom {{voted for}} British {{withdrawal}} from the EU in the 2016 EU referendum held on 23 June 2016, and afterwards there was speculation that the act would be either repealed or amended. In October 2016 the prime minister, Theresa May, promised a [...] "Great Repeal Bill" [...] which would repeal the 1972 act and import its regulations into UK law, with effect from the date of British withdrawal; the regulations could then be amended or repealed on a case-by-case basis. The <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (<b>Withdrawal)</b> Bill {{was introduced in the}} House of Commons in July 2017.|$|R
50|$|Wilson campaigned {{in favour}} of the United Kingdom {{remaining}} {{a member of the}} <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> at the 2016 United Kingdom <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> membership referendum, then later voted against the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> Bill 2017.|$|R
50|$|Cash {{withdrawals}} {{are usually}} free for {{an owner of}} a Dutch debit card, both within The Netherlands and in other places of the <b>European</b> <b>Union.</b> Cash <b>withdrawals</b> from another bank in The Netherlands {{is limited to a}} maximum of once a day and a lower limit per transaction. The one transaction per day limit generally does not apply to withdrawals outside the country. You may withdraw up to 2300 euro per cashpoint.|$|R
5000|$|Neill was {{strongly}} opposed to Brexit {{prior to the}} 2016 referendum.. On 7 February 2017, along with six other Conservative Members of Parliament, he defied the Party whip and voted in favour of New Clause 110 of the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> Bill.|$|R
5000|$|On Thursday 19 January, Jeremy Corbyn was {{reported}} to be preparing to order Labour MPs to vote to support triggering Article 50 in the vote on the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> Bill 2017, in line with a three-line whip. This triggered the following resignations from the frontbench (in chronological order): ...|$|R
50|$|Borwick {{voted in}} favour of the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> Bill 2016-17 in early 2017 and against amendments, {{including}} the proposed amendments for EU nationals to retain their right {{to stay in the}} UK post-Brexit and {{to take into account the}} Good Friday Agreement and the interests of the people of Gibraltar.|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the implications of}} the UK’s vote to leave the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> in relation to the fundamental rights of EU citizens. The possible consequences for individual rights protection are examined in light of UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to formally trigger art. 50 TEU, the government’s paper on ‘Safeguarding the Position of EU Citizens Living in the UK and UK Nationals Living in the EU’ and the recently published <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (<b>Withdrawal)</b> Bill. This article intends to highlight an issue that has seemingly been set aside amidst the chaotic developments related to Brexit – the protection of fundamental human rights. The article’s central argument is twofold. Firstly, the article contends that the UK Government currently risks potentially breaching several substantive provisions contained within the European Convention on Human Rights because a satisfactory regime of rights protection for EU citizens living in the UK, or British citizens in other EU Member States, has not yet been clearly established. Secondly, the plan to exclude the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights must be seriously reconsidered. The Charter currently provides the strongest level of protection for certain human rights in Europe, and it is argued that it cannot be so easily sacrificed. The UK, irrespective of Brexit, must be serious about its commitment to the protection of human rights...|$|R
50|$|Following {{a period}} working {{part of the}} Shadow Defence Team under Shadow Secretary of State for Defence Maria Eagle, Maskell was {{appointed}} Shadow Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary {{as part of the}} Labour Party's post-Brexit reshuffle. Maskell resigned from her position ahead of the vote on the second reading in the House of Commons <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> Bill 2017 which triggers Article 50 which carried a three-line whip imposed on Labour MPs.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} New Zealand’s {{distance selling}} regulation, {{in particular the}} changes made {{in the course of}} the recent consumer law reform. First, the paper assesses the reforms with regard to telemarketing. While some criticism is expressed as to the content of the prescribed disclosure by the supplier, the approach followed is approved of in general. The paper then examines the merits of a general right of withdrawal in distance selling contracts as it exists in the <b>European</b> <b>Union.</b> Analysing <b>withdrawal</b> rights from an economical, psychological and ethical perspective, the paper argues that both from a supplier’s and from a consumer’s point of view, the advantages are outweighed by the disadvantages that come with withdrawal rights...|$|R
5000|$|Pearson criticised the Conservative Party's {{leadership}} for being [...] "silly" [...] {{and argued that}} they should try to get UKIP members back into the fold by adopting more eurosceptic policies themselves. He has tabled a number of unsuccessful bills in the House of Lords demanding Britain's <b>withdrawal</b> from the <b>European</b> <b>Union.</b> In November 2006, he tabled the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Implications of <b>Withdrawal)</b> Bill, which called for an official cost benefit analysis of UK's EU membership. He joined UKIP on 7 January 2007, citing David Cameron's refusal to tell the British people about the disadvantages they suffer because of Britain's membership of the EU.|$|R
5000|$|R (on the {{application}} of Miller and Dos Santos) v Secretary of State for Exiting the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> is a legal case decided by the United Kingdom Supreme Court on 24 January 2017, which ruled that the UK Government (the executive) may not initiate <b>withdrawal</b> from the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> by formal notification to the Council of the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> as prescribed by Article 50 of the Treaty on <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> without an Act of the UK Parliament permitting {{the government to do}} so. Two days later, the government responded by bringing to Parliament the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> Bill 2017 for first reading in the House of Commons on 26 January 2017. The case is informally referred to as [...] "the Miller case" [...] or Miller's case.|$|R
25|$|Following the party's {{decision}} {{to support the}} <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> Bill 2017, at least three shadow cabinet ministers, all representing constituencies which voted {{to remain in the}} EU, resigned from their position {{as a result of the}} party's {{decision to}} invoke Article 50 under the bill. 47 of 229 Labour MPs voted against the bill (in defiance of the party's three-line whip). Unusually, the rebel frontbenchers did not face immediate dismissal. According to the New Statesman, approximately 7,000 members of the Labour Party also resigned in protest over the party's stance; this number has been confirmed by senior Labour sources.|$|R
50|$|Butler is {{a former}} chair of the Women's Parliamentary Labour Party. Following a vote in September 2016, she was {{defeated}} by Jess Phillips. Butler was seen as being an ally of Jeremy Corbyn. After Corbyn's second election as leader, Butler was appointed as Labour's Shadow Minister for Diverse Communities in early October 2016. At {{the beginning of the}} following February, she resigned from this post just before the vote on the second reading in the House of Commons of <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> Bill 2017 which triggers Article 50 which carried a three-line whip imposed on Labour MPs. She was reappointed to the post on 14 June 2017.|$|R
50|$|In a {{referendum}} in June 2016 the United Kingdom voted {{to leave the}} <b>European</b> <b>Union.</b> The majority of those voting in Northern Ireland, however, voted for the UK to remain. Of the parties in the Assembly, only the DUP and the small TUV and People Before Profit Alliance had campaigned for a Leave vote. Irish politicians began the discussion regarding possible changes to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. There are several key {{issues related to the}} United Kingdom <b>withdrawal</b> from the <b>European</b> <b>Union,</b> including the establishment of a new external border of the <b>European</b> <b>Union,</b> or the <b>withdrawal</b> of access, to Northern Ireland, of the regional development assistance scheme (and new funding thereof) from the <b>European</b> <b>Union.</b> Sinn Féin cited these concerns as the basis for new discussion on a united Ireland. These calls were rejected by the British government and Unionist politicians, with Theresa Villiers arguing that {{there was no evidence that}} opinion in Northern Ireland had shifted towards being in favour of a united Ireland. In the 2017 Assembly election, the DUP lost ten seats and came just one seat ahead of Sinn Féin. Sinn Féin used this opportunity to call for a Northern Ireland referendum on a united Ireland.|$|R
5|$|Privy Counsellors {{have the}} right to sit {{on the steps of the}} Sovereign's Throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords during debates, a {{privilege}} which was shared with heirs apparent of those hereditary peers who were to become members of the House of Lords before Labour's partial Reform of the Lords in 1999, diocesan bishops of the Church of England yet to be Lords Spiritual, retired bishops who formerly sat in the House of Lords, the Dean of Westminster, Peers of Ireland, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery and the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. While Privy Counsellors {{have the right}} to sit on the steps of the Sovereign's Throne they do so only as observers and are not allowed to participate in any of the workings of the House of Lords. Nowadays this privilege is rarely exercised. A notable recent instance of the exercising of this privilege was used by the Prime Minister, Theresa May, who watched the opening of the debate of the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (Notification of <b>Withdrawal)</b> Bill 2017 in the House of Lords.|$|R
40|$|The role {{of groups}} of producers, acting as private bodies in the {{regulation}} of agricultural and food markets, in EU legislation is becoming more impor- tant than in the past, mainly {{as a consequence of}} the reduction of public intervention in market regu- lation. In the framework of the quality scheme regu- lation 1151 / 12, the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> acknowledges the importance of groups representing businesses operators, involved in the governance of member activities. Their role in promoting and preserving the quality of products balance the lack of compulsory public intervention in the protection of designation of origin toward implementing the extra UE market of quality products. However, <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> does not <b>withdrawal</b> her control on private subjects with public functions. The magnitude of controls increases with private rules conflicting with free competition. Therefore, entrusting private bodies in the definition of binding rules extended to the quality producers within the geographical area, art. 150 and 172 of Reg. 1308 / 13 provide a set of limits and a double check, by Member State and the Commission, to evaluate the effects of these rules on the market. Conversely, referring to private inspection bodies, acting instead of public bodies, legislative rules should prevent the risk that they operate as “busi- ness operators on the markets” rather than public bodies with public functions...|$|R
