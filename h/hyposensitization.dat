50|$|By {{contrast}} uncontrolled use {{of conventional}} (escalating dose) immunotherapy (<b>hyposensitization</b> not EPD) for general allergic conditions {{was believed to}} be responsible for at least 29 deaths in the UK, and is now banned in the United Kingdom except in hospital under close observation. A working party of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology reviewed the role of conventional high dose specific allergen immunotherapy (not EPD) in the treatment of allergic disease and recommends high dose specific allergen immunotherapy for treating summer hay fever uncontrolled by conventional medication and for wasp and bee venom hypersensitivity. For the recommended indications the risk:benefit ratio was found to be acceptable for conventional immunotherapy provided patients are carefully selected; in particular, patients with asthma should be excluded and injections should be given only by allergists experienced in this form of treatment in a clinic where resuscitative facilities are available and patients remain symptom free for an observation period after injection which is sufficient to detect all serious adverse reactions.|$|E

40|$|The {{action of}} IgG {{antibody}} on basophils was studied during <b>hyposensitization</b> therapy in bronchial asthmatics. IgE and IgG antibodies {{bound to the}} surface of basophils, and the redistribution of IgE receptors were observed by immuno-scanning electron microscopy. The ratio of IgG to IgE antibodies bound to basophils increased significantly during <b>hyposensitization</b> therapy (p< 0. 01). The occurrence of cap and patch formations of IgE receptors on the surface of basophils diminished during <b>hyposensitization</b> therapy. The effects on the passive sensitization of basophils with IgG(4) myeloma protein were also studied in vitro. The results showed that the ratio of IgG(4) to IgE antibodies on the cell increased, and binding of anti-IgE antibody significantly diminished (p< 0. 01). The percent of reactive basophils decreased when anti-IgE antiserum was added. These findings indicate that IgG(4) antibodies affect the binding between IgE antibody and anti-IgE or antigens on the surface of basophils as a blocking antibody in <b>hyposensitization</b> therapy...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{allergic}} {{contact dermatitis}} (ACD) previously sensitized T cells cause skin damage. If an ubiquitous allergen such as nickel is involved, no effective treatment is available. Down-regulation of this allergic response has been described after antigen presentation {{in the absence of}} adequate costimulatory signals. UV exposure can enhance such <b>hyposensitization.</b> Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} establish the capability of a <b>hyposensitization</b> procedure to induce antigen-specific tolerance. Methods: Twenty-one patients with nickel ACD were randomly assigned to either a hyposensitized or control group. A schedule consisting of UVB treatment and subcutaneous nickel sulfate administration (<b>hyposensitization)</b> or UVB only (control) was applied. During the ensuing 2 years, several clinical and immunologic features were monitored. Results: During UVB treatment we observed a singificant clinical improvement in both groups that persisted in the hyposensitized group. Except for incresed slope variances of specific lymphocyte proliferation in time, no clear changes were seen in the immunologic findings. Conclusion: Despite significant clinical improvement induced by UVB, <b>hyposensitization</b> did not induce significant changes in the immunologic findings in patients with nickel ACD...|$|E
40|$|Anaphylaxis in a glucose-free medium {{containing}} pyruvate {{caused a}} release of histamine and {{a significant decrease in}} the ATP level of rat mast cells. The fall was maximal after 10 min and it was found to reverse after 22 min. Glucose completely counteracted the ATP fall without changing the anaphylactic histamine release. Furthermore, the oxidative metabolism of exogenous pyruvate to CO 2 was stimulated in the mast cell. A high level of protection of mast cells to antigen challenge was obtained following <b>hyposensitization</b> and only a small amount of the intracellular histamine was released in contrast to non-hyposensitized cells. <b>Hyposensitization</b> counteracted the ATP fall by antigen challenge but the increase in oxidative metabolism remained unchanged. The results indicate that <b>hyposensitization</b> exerts effects in the mast cell consistent with a reduced ATP utilization or with a reduced uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. The mechanism of the <b>hyposensitization</b> must be due to inhibition of {{one or more of the}} cellular steps leading to histamine release and subsequent morphological changes of the cell or to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation...|$|E
40|$|Poison ivy and oak urushiols {{or their}} {{components}} {{were compared with}} the respective esterified derivatives for efficacy in oral desensitization of Hartley guinea pigs sensitized to urushiols. The esterified derivatives produced a significantly greater degree of <b>hyposensitization</b> than did free urushiol counterparts. Suppression produced by esterified urushiols was of longer duration than that produced by free urushiols. Groups of sensitized guinea pigs were given high (100 mg/kg) or low (10 mg/kg) doses of a mixture of acetylated, saturated urushiol congeners over a 1 -, 2 -, or 3 -week period. High doses produced {{a greater degree of}} <b>hyposensitization</b> regardless of the dosage schedule used. Low doses did not produce significant <b>hyposensitization</b> unless given over a shorter (1 week) schedule. Large single booster doses (33 mg/kg/week) of the acetate derivatives produced a rebound in responsiveness when given, 2 weeks following the last dose of the initial series, to animals hyposensitized with 10 mg/kg. No such rebound in sensitivity occurred in animals given a series of high initial doses. The dosage and schedule were also shown to be important considerations for achieving maximal <b>hyposensitization.</b> The most important finding of this study was that sensitized guinea pigs can be desensitized or hyposensitized to poison ivy and oak urushiols via the oral route...|$|E
40|$|A {{double-blind}} {{clinical trial}} of <b>hyposensitization</b> with aqueous extracts of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (the house-dust mite) and human skin scales showed a substantial improvement in symptoms in 11 asthmatics allergic to house dust {{treated with the}} D. pteronyssinus extract {{and a reduction in}} their need for other therapy. Five patients were well for a year but six relapsed. These results contrasted with the generally unfavourable course of the patients treated with the extract of human skin scales.

As high as 17 dogs (77 %) in 22 cases treated with <b>hyposensitization</b> therapy showed complete or remarkable improvement of skin lesions evaluated by the Halliwell's grading method. It is suggested that hyposensitizaton therapy {{based on the results}} of intradermal skin test is a highly effective treatment for canine allergic dermatitis...|$|E
40|$|Two opposed {{modes of}} action have been {{attributed}} to immunoglobulin G (IgG) in immediate-type allergy. On the one hand, a small fraction of IgG may have anaphylactic properties. On the other hand, IgG antibodies induced by <b>hyposensitization</b> therapy are considered to act as allergen blocking antibodies. The IgG 4 isotype is the major antibody in the immune response induced by <b>hyposensitization</b> therapy and is presumably the only IgG subclass with homocytotropic properties. Immunochemical characteristics of IgG 4, such as functional monovalency and inability to activate the complement system, underline the special place of this isotype in the humoral immune response. Detection of IgG 4 antibodies in serum has a very limited use in allergy diagnosis. IgG 4 antibodies do not appear to have anaphylactic properties, in spite of the homocytotropic activity suggested by some in vitro experiments. However, the assay may be of importance for measuring immune responses in occupational exposure to antigenic substances and in monitoring <b>hyposensitization</b> therap...|$|E
40|$|Anaphylactic <b>hyposensitization</b> of rat {{mast cells}} in vitro was {{demonstrated}} by preincubating the cells with specific antigen in suboptimal concentrations. The {{reduction of the}} histamine release was more pronounced when the cells were pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of antigen than with the final concentration. The inhibition remained unchanged for more than 3 hr. Non-specific antigen did not influence the histamine release, whereas a 70 % inhibition was demonstrated by specific antigen. In rats sensitized to two different antigens, preincubation {{with one of these}} inhibited the subsequent histamine release induced by either of the two antigens.

40|$|Untoward {{allergic}} reactions were monitored prospectively in 98 patients undergoing <b>hyposensitization</b> with depot type preparations of house dust mites (42 patients) or grass pollens administered before the pollen season (56 patients). 44 % {{of the patients}} experienced {{at least one major}} local reaction, usually when injected with high doses of allergens. A mild systemic reaction (benign crisis of rhinitis or asthma within 12 hours after the injection) was reported at least once by 9 % of the pollen-treated and 52 % of the mite-treated patients. A severe systemic reaction, which improved rapidly with adrenaline, was noted in 3 % of the pollen-treated and 5 % of the mite-treated patients.

40|$|Background. Nickel {{contact allergy}} remains common in Western countries, and the {{dermatitis}} may require prolonged treatment. The {{development of new}} strategies aimed at {{improving the quality of}} life of affected individuals is needed. Objectives. To investigate the efficacy of oral <b>hyposensitization</b> in nickel-allergic individuals and how this affects in vitro T cell responsiveness to the metal. Methods. Twenty-eight nickel-allergic patients received a daily dose of 50 μg of elemental nickel (given as NiSO 4 · 6 H 2 O) in cellulose capsules for 3 months. Severity of clinical manifestations, in vivo nickel responsiveness and in vitro T cell responses to the metal were assessed after 1 and 3 months. Results. Twenty-six patients finished the study. In these patients, oral <b>hyposensitization</b> ameliorated clinical manifestations despite continued nickel exposures, and increased the threshold of skin responsiveness to nickel. The 12 enrolled patients in the immunological study showed decreased in vitro T lymphocyte responsiveness to the metal, in terms of both cell proliferation and cytokine release. In the 1 -year follow-up, 50 % of the patients experienced relapses of the clinical manifestations at sites of topical exposure to nickel. Conclusions. Our study suggested therapeutic efficacy of oral <b>hyposensitization</b> in allergic individuals. Placebo-controlled studies are required to confirm the results and determine the optimal therapeutic regimen for prolonged beneficial effects...|$|E
40|$|A {{longitudinal}} study of patients undergoing rush <b>hyposensitization</b> by honey-bee or yellow jacket venom revealed significant changes of the immunophenotypes until the optimal dose was reached, and a progressive reversion to pre-treatment values in the following months. The activation markers CD 23 on B cells and CD 25 (IL- 2 receptor) on T and B lymphocytes decreased. Although there was little variation of the major CD 4 and CD 8 lymphocyte populations, CD 45 R+ cells increased whilst CDw 29 + lymphocytes diminished. This inverse variation {{was associated with a}} peak of CD 4 + CD 45 R+ cells with concomitant decrease in CD 4 + CDw 29 + cells showing an inverse effect of the treatment on the reciprocal subsets of CD 4 lymphocytes. This indicates a shift in the suppressor/inducer to helper/inducer cell ratio early during rush <b>hyposensitization</b> which may also suggest reversion into a less mature stage of CD 4 + cells, associated with the transition from a highly allergen-reactive state to progressive unresponsiveness...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of an oral specific <b>hyposensitization</b> therapy in children with atopic dermatitis and positive prick skin tests and/or RAST to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (D. pt.).

Group A: children with atopic dermatitis and allergic asthma and/or rhinitis; groups B and C: children with exclusively atopic dermatitis. Groups A and B received specific <b>hyposensitization</b> therapy. Group C was the control group. The clinical evaluation of the dermatological lesions, at the end of our study, didn't show any significant difference among the three groups. Moreover, the onset of respiratory symptoms between the two groups with exclusively atopic dermatitis was similar and not related to the positivity of prick skin tests and/or RAST to seasonal allergens. Our study suggests that specific hyposensitisation therapy with extracts of D. pt., although with no side effects, does not affect the natural history of atopic dermatitis...|$|E

H. P. Van Bever, W. J. Stevens. ABSTRACT: The effect of <b>hyposensitization</b> (HS) upon the allergen evoked immediate asthmatic reaction (IAR), late asthmatic reaction (LAR) and upon bronchial reactivity towards histamine was examined. Eighteen young asthmatic patients were studied using a double-blind, placebo· controlled design. All were allergic to house dust mite (HDM) and demon-strated an IAR and a LAR after bronchial provocation with HDM. Furthermore, all, except one child, demonstrated bronchial hyperreactivity towards histamine (median provocative dose producing a 20 % fall in forced ex· piratory volume in one second (PD 1 J histamine = 0. 19 mg·ml· 1, range: 0. 02 - 8 mg•ml" 1). The subjects were randomly {{divided into two groups}} to receive HDM or placebo injections during one year. After the one year period, the IAR was less severe in the subjects who received HDM injections (p= 0. 02), while this reduction was not observed in the subjects who received placebo injections. Also, in the HDM group a small but significant increase of the median PD 10 HDM was observed (p= 0. 04). Further· more, the LAR was less severe in tl:ie subjects who received HDM injections (p= 0. 02), while the subjects who received placebo injections showed the same severity of LAR after one year (p= 0. 44). Histamine reactivity did not change after HDM injections or after placebo Injections. Thus, HS reduces the severity of the IAR and LAR without any change in histamine reactivity...|$|E
40|$|Although skin {{grafting}} {{is a common}} surgical technique, the immunological state of grafted skin remains unelucidated. An experimental model {{has shown that the}} development of murine contact hypersensitivity (CHS) is depressed when mice are sensitized with a hapten through full-thickness grafted skin. We explored the immunological mechanisms underlying this <b>hyposensitization,</b> focusing on the fate of Langerhans cells (LCs). When FITC was applied to grafted skin, FITC-bearing LCs were capable of migrating to the draining lymph nodes. Epidermal cell suspensions isolated from the grafted skin produced a high amount of IL- 10 as assessed by real-time PCR. Adoptive transfer of immune lymph node cells from the sensitized mice suppressed the CHS response of recipients in an antigen-specific manner. CD 4 +CD 25 + but not CD 4 +CD 25 − T cells purified from lymph node cells were responsible for this suppression. Finally, we detected high expression of receptor activators of nuclear factor κ-B ligand (RANKL) in the grafted skin, and found that recombinant RANKL stimulated LCs to produce IL- 10. These findings suggest that the <b>hyposensitization</b> of CHS through the grafted skin is not attributable merely to the reduction of LC number but that IL- 10 -producing LCs exert a downmodulatory effect by inducing regulatory T cells...|$|E

40|$|Forty-three {{patients}} with type I allergic respiratory diseases received aqueous grass pollen immunotherapy in a prospective study designed {{to compare the}} clinical and biological effects of a semi-rush <b>hyposensitization</b> (20 patients) with ordinary <b>hyposensitization</b> (23 patients). Before {{the start of the}} therapy (end of previous grass pollen season, t 1) and before (t 2) and after the next grass pollen season (t 3), total serum IgE (tIgE), grass pollen-specific IgE (GPsIgE), grass pollen-specific IgG (GPsIgG) and complement factors C 3 and C 4 were determined. GPsIgE and GPsIgG levels increased significantly more during immunotherapy in patients receiving the semi-rush scheme as compared with the ordinary scheme. There were no significant changes between the two schemes at any times for tIgE, C 3 and C 4. GPsIgG was already higher in allergic patients before the start of therapy as compared with non-allergic patients and controls. Clinical improvement was the same in patients treated with the semi-rush scheme as in the ordinary group. The number of side effects was not statistically different between the two groups. In neither group was there a correlation between the change in biological parameters and change in clinical symptoms.

Peak expiratory flow, measured four times a day, was also followed. Intradermal skin tests and bronchial challenge tests were performed with allergen together with an evaluation of nonspecific bronchial reactivity. Specific IgE and IgG antibodies were assayed after separation from the bulk of serum immunoglobulins by immunoadsorption. The study was carried out over two years according to a double-blind protocol. Intradermal inoculation of antigen-antibody complexes resulted in a marked reduction of both clinical and medication scores. No systemic side-effects were observed and only mild wheal and flare reactions were noted at the injection site.

Three of them had no demonstrable specific IgE against wasp or bee venom in serum, and a skin test that was only weakly positive for wasp venom. One patient had specific IgE against wasp venom and a clearly positive skin test to wasp venom. The other patient had specific IgE against both wasp and bee venom and a skin test that was only weakly positive to wasp venom.
