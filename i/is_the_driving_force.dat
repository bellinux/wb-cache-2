5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. An example {{is the development of}} wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force,</b> but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E
5|$|According to Kohlberg, someone {{progressing}} to {{a higher}} stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing {{the limitations of the}} current stage of thinking <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.|$|E

25|$|Three main {{driving forces}} used in {{different}} version of diffusion models are moisture content, the partial pressure of water vapour, and the chemical potential (Skaar, 1988; Keey et al., 2000). These are discussed here, including capillary action, {{which is a}} mechanism for free water transport in permeable softwoods. Total pressure difference <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> during wood vacuum drying.|$|E
25|$|The protons {{from the}} {{oxidized}} water molecules are {{released into the}} thylakoid lumen, thus contributing to the generation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This proton gradient <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> for ATP synthesis via photophosphorylation and coupling the absorption of light energy and photolysis of water {{to the creation of}} chemical energy during photosynthesis. The O2 remaining after oxidation of the water molecule is released into the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Galvanic {{corrosion}} is an electrochemical {{process whereby}} one metal corrodes preferentially to another when both metals are in electrical contact {{with each other}} in the presence of an electrolyte, such as moisture and salts. This is because the dissimilar metals have different electrode potentials. The potential difference between the dissimilar metals <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> for the accelerated attack on the metal with the lower galvanic number (i.e., the anode). Over time, the anode metal dissolves into the electrolyte.|$|E

25|$|Joseph W. Houppert {{acknowledges}} that {{some critics have}} tried to cast Caesar as the protagonist, but that ultimately Brutus <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> in the play and is therefore the tragic hero. Brutus attempts to put the republic over his personal relationship with Caesar and kills him. Brutus makes the political mistakes that bring down the republic that his ancestors created. He acts on his passions, does not gather enough evidence to make reasonable decisions and is manipulated by Cassius and the other conspirators.|$|E
25|$|Motivation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> {{of desire}} behind all {{deliberate}} actions of humans. Motivation {{is based on}} emotion—specifically, on the search for satisfaction (positive emotional experiences), and the avoidance of conflict. Positive and negative {{is defined by the}} individual brain state, which may be influenced by social norms: a person may be driven to self-injury or violence because their brain is conditioned to create a positive response to these actions. Motivation is important because it is involved in the performance of all learned responses. Within psychology, conflict avoidance and the libido are seen to be primary motivators. Within economics, motivation is often seen to be based on incentives; these may be financial, moral, or coercive. Religions generally posit divine or demonic influences.|$|E
25|$|Incidents {{of police}} {{brutality}} seem to still be occurring at a consistent rate, however it {{is yet to be}} seen whether the trial of body cameras will make a difference to the number of incidents occurring or to the number of police who are prosecuted for misconduct. Additionally, there needs to be more work done by the government to break down negative social stereotypes that can lead to prejudice, racial profiling and the kind of aggressive hatred which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> behind many instances {{of police brutality}} - the involvement of NGOs is valuable however the Austrian government needs to take a strong stance against abuse of power by police in order for real change to happen. One way to do this, as suggested by Amnesty International Austria, would be to disband the Bereitschaftspolizei, Vienna's riot police, as these officers have frequently been involved with human rights violations and situations of police brutality. Amnesty also suggest that Austria should adopt a National Action Plan against Racism (as is required by the 2001 Durban Declaration and Programme of Action) - something which they have previously refused to do. On a whole, Austria is moving slowly towards eradicating police brutality, however there needs to be much more done in order to ensure the rights of citizens are sufficiently protected.|$|E

500|$|Another {{effect of}} the mission was the {{promotion}} of the cult of Pope Gregory the Great by the Northumbrians amongst others; the first Life of Gregory is from Whitby Abbey in Northumbria. Gregory was not popular in Rome, and it was not until Bede's Ecclesiastical History began to circulate that Gregory's cult also took root there. Gregory, in Bede's work, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> behind the Gregorian mission, and Augustine and the other missionaries are portrayed as depending on him for advice and help in their endeavours. [...] Bede also gives {{a leading role in the}} conversion of Northumbria to Gregorian missionaries, especially in his Chronica Maiora, in which no mention is made of any Irish missionaries. By putting Gregory at the centre of the mission, even though he did not take part in it, Bede helped to spread the cult of Gregory, who not only became one of the major saints in Anglo-Saxon England, but continued to overshadow Augustine even in the afterlife; an Anglo-Saxon church council of 747 ordered that Augustine should always be mentioned in the liturgy right after Gregory.|$|E

2500|$|Followers {{participate}} in various socio-spiritual activities {{with the objective}} to earn the grace of the guru and thus attain association with God through voluntary service. These numerous activities stem directly from the ideals taught by Swaminarayan, to find spiritual devotion {{in the service of}} others. By serving and volunteering in communities to please the guru, devotees [...] are considered to be serving the guru. [...] This relationship <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> for the spiritual actions of devotees. The guru is Mahant Swami Maharaj, who is seen as embodiment of selfless devotion. Under the guidance of Mahant Swami Maharaj, followers observe the tenets of Swaminarayan through the above-mentioned practices, striving to please the guru and become close to God.|$|E

The Spirit is [...] "poured out" [...] at Pentecost, on the first Samaritan and Gentile believers, and on disciples who had been baptised only by John the Baptist, each time as a sign of God's approval. The Holy Spirit represents God's power (At his ascension, Jesus tells his followers, [...] "You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you"): through it the disciples are given speech to convert thousands in Jerusalem, forming the first church (the term is used {{for the first time in}} Acts 5).|$|E

2500|$|Avi Beker, an Israeli {{scholar and}} former Secretary General of the World Jewish Congress, {{regarded}} {{the idea of}} the chosen people as Judaism's defining concept and [...] "the central unspoken psychological, historical, and theological problem at the heart of Jewish-Gentile relations." [...] In his book The Chosen: The History of an Idea, and the Anatomy of an Obsession, Beker expresses the view that the concept of chosenness <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> behind Jewish-Gentile relations, explaining both the admiration and, more pointedly, the envy and hatred the world has felt for the Jews in religious and also secular terms. Beker argues that while Christianity has modified its doctrine on the displacement of the Jews, Islam has neither reversed nor reformed its theology concerning the succession of both the Jews and the Christians. According to Beker, this presents a major barrier to conflict resolution in the Arab-Israeli conflict.|$|E
2500|$|The attorneys' fees {{provision}} of Title III does provide incentive for lawyers to specialize {{and engage in}} serial ADA litigation, but a disabled plaintiff does not obtain financial reward from attorneys' fees unless they act as their own attorney, or as mentioned above, a disabled plaintiff resides {{in a state that}} provides for minimum compensation and court fees in lawsuits. Moreover, there may be a benefit to these [...] "private attorneys general" [...] who identify and compel the correction of illegal conditions: they may increase the number of public accommodations accessible to persons with disabilities.
