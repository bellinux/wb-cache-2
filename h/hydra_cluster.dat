The {{distance of the}} <b>Hydra</b> <b>cluster</b> was estimated as 7. 3 X 10 ^ 6 parsecs and the average apparent velocity of recession to be expected was given as v = 4100 km. /sec. No observations of the red shift for nebulae in the <b>Hydra</b> <b>cluster</b> were available at the time. Dr. Hubble subsequently obtained a spectrum plate for NGC 3309 which nebula {{is a member of}} the <b>Hydra</b> <b>cluster.</b> He kindly informs me that the apparent velocity of recession for NGC 3309 is of the order of 3950 km. /sec., a value which is in good agreement with our original estimate.

Because of the scarce available literature data, we selected {{a small sample of}} five blue compact dwarf (BCD) candidates in Antlia for observation. Using the Gemini South and GMOS camera, we acquired the Halpha imaging needed to detect star-forming regions in this sample. With the long-slit spectroscopic data of the brightest seven knots detected in three BCD candidates, we derived their basic chemical properties. Using archival VISTA VHS survey images, we derived K_S magnitudes and surface brightness profile fits for the whole sample to assess basic physical properties. FS 90 - 98, FS 90 - 106, and FS 90 - 147 are confirmed as BCDs and cluster members, based on their morphology, K_S surface photometry, oxygen abundance, and velocity redshift. FS 90 - 155 and FS 90 - 319 did not show any Hα emission, and they could not be confirmed as dwarf cluster star-forming galaxies. Based on our data, we studied some fundamental relations to compare star forming dwarfs (BCDs and dIs) in the LV and in the Virgo, Fornax, <b>Hydra,</b> and Antlia <b>clusters.</b> Star-forming dwarfs in nearby clusters appear to follow same fundamental relations in the near infrared with similar objects in the LV, specifically the size-luminosity and the metallicity-luminosity, while other more fundamental relations could not be checked in Antlia due to lack of data.

Our HST/WFPC 2 data yield normal globular cluster colors and hence metallicities for this galaxy.

40|$|The {{kinematics}} of the {{diffuse light}} in the densest regions of the nearby clusters can be unmasked using the planetary nebulae (PNs) as probes of the stellar motions. The position-velocity diagrams around the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) identify the relative contributions from the outer halos and the intracluster light (ICL), defined as the light radiated by the stars floating in the cluster potential. The kinematics of the ICL can then be used to asses the dynamical status of the nearby cluster cores and to infer their formation histories. The cores of the Virgo and Coma are observed to be far from equilibrium, with mergers currently on-going, while the ICL properties in the Fornax and <b>Hydra</b> <b>clusters</b> show the presence of sub-components being accreted in their cores, but superposed to an otherwise relaxed population of stars. Finally the comparison of the observed ICL properties with those predicted from Lambda-CDM simulations indicates a qualitative agreement and provides insights on the ICL formation.

40|$|Using {{two-dimensional}} velocity {{maps and}} I-band photometry, {{we have created}} mass models of 40 spiral galaxies using the Milgrom relation (the basis of modified Newtonian dynamics, or MOND) to complement previous work. A Bayesian technique is employed to compare several different dark matter halo models to Milgrom and Newtonian models. Pseudo-isothermal dark matter halos provide the best statistical fits to the data in a majority of cases, while the Milgrom relation generally provides good fits as well. We also find that Milgrom models give mass-to-light ratios that roughly correlate with galaxy color, as predicted by stellar population models. A subsample of galaxies in the <b>Hydra</b> <b>cluster</b> follow a tight relation between mass-to-light and color, but one that is significantly different from relations found in previous studies. Ruling out the Milgrom relation with rotational kinematics is difficult due to systematic uncertainties in the observations as well as underlying model assumptions.

40|$|A semi-analytic {{model of}} cluster cooling flows is presented. The model assumes that episodic nuclear {{activity}} followed by radiative cooling without mass-dropout cycles the cluster gas between a relatively homogeneous, nearly isothermal post-outburst {{state and a}} cuspy configuration in which a cooling catastrophe initiates the next nuclear outburst. Fitting the model to Chandra data for the <b>Hydra</b> <b>cluster,</b> a lower limit of 284 Myr until the next outburst of Hydra A is derived. Density, temperature and emission-measure profiles at several times prior to the cooling catastrophe are presented. It proves possible to fit the mass M(?) with entropy index P?-? less than ? to a simple power-law form, which is almost invariant as the cluster cools. We show that radiative cooling automatically establishes this power-law form if the entropy index was constant throughout the cluster gas at some early epoch or after an active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity cycle. To high precision, the central value of ? decreases linearly with time. The fraction of clusters in a magnitude-limited sample that have gas cooler than T is calculated, and is shown to be small for T= 2 keV. Similarly, only 1 per cent of clusters in such a sample contain gas with Pp-? < 2 keV cm 2. Entropy production in shocks is shown to be small. The entropy that is radiated from the cluster can be replaced if a few per cent of the cluster gas passes through bubbles heated during an outburst of the AGN...|$|E

This very low surface brightness object, HCC- 087, was originally classified as an early-type dwarf in the <b>Hydra</b> <b>Cluster</b> Catalogue (HCC), but our re-analysis of the ESO-VLT/FORS images of the HCC unearthed {{a clear indication of}} an S-shaped morphology and a large spatial extent. Its shape, luminosity (M_V = – 11. 6 mag), and physical size (at a half-light radius of 3. 1 kpc and a full length of ~ 5. 9 kpc) are comparable to the recently discovered NGC 4449 B and the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal, all of which are undergoing clear tidal disruption. Aided by N-body simulations we argue that HCC- 087 is currently at its first apocenter, at 150 kpc, around the cluster center and that it is being tidally disrupted by the galaxy cluster's potential itself. An interaction with the nearby (50 kpc) S 0 cluster galaxy HCC- 005, at M_* ~ 3 × 10 ^(10) M_☉ is rather unlikely, as this constellation requires a significant amount of dynamical friction and thus low relative velocities. The S-shaped morphology and large spatial extent of the satellite would, however, also appear if HCC- 087 would orbit the cluster center. These features appear to be characteristic properties of satellites that are seen {{in the process of being}} tidally disrupted, independent of the environment of the destruction.

40|$|The X-ray data {{obtained}} with XMM-Newton {{are used to}} investigate the complex structure of the gas in {{the atmosphere of the}} Virgo cluster around M 87. We construct a simple model for the temperature and density distribution. This model implies that the cumulative mass of the cluster gas is a power law of its entropy index, kT n- 2 / 3, similar to the <b>Hydra</b> <b>cluster.</b> This supports the idea that such power laws are a direct consequence of gas cooling in a gravitational potential. In the cluster atmosphere, hot bubbles of gas injected by the active galactic nuclei (AGN) are rising buoyantly. We estimate the age of these structures from the synchrotron radio data and find that this 'radiative age' is consistent with the estimated dynamical time-scale. However, this requires a spatial separation of the relativistic particles from the magnetic field. The age estimates suggest an activity cycle of the AGN in M 87 of roughly 10 8 yr. We show that the largest radio structures are consistent with being the remnants of buoyant bubbles injected by the AGN during an even earlier activity cycle. The wakes behind the currently rising hot bubbles uplift cold gas from the cluster centre. Using a simple model for the trajectory of the cold gas, we demonstrate that the observations by XMM-Newton of a mix of hot and cold gas in the cluster atmosphere {{in the vicinity of the}} radio structure can be explained in this scenario.

We find that NGC 3311 has a huge population of ~ 16, 000 GCs, closely similar to the prototypical high specific frequency Virgo giant M 87. The color-magnitude distribution shows that the metal-poor blue GC sequence and the metal-richer red sequence are both present, with nearly equal numbers of clusters. Bimodal fits to the color distributions confirm that the blue sequence shows the same trend of progressively increasing metallicity with GC mass that has previously been found in many other large galaxies; the correlation we find corresponds to a scaling of GC metallicity with mass of Z ~ M^ 0. 6. By contrast, the red sequence shows no change of mean metallicity with mass, but it shows an upward extension to much higher than normal luminosity into the UCD-like range, strengthening the potential connections between massive GCs and UCDs. The GC luminosity function, which we measure down to the turnover point at M_I = - 8. 4, also has a normal form like those in other giant ellipticals. Within the Hydra field, another giant elliptical NGC 3309 is sitting just 100 " from the cD NGC 3311. We use our data to solve simultaneously for the spatial structure and total GC populations of both galaxies at once. Their specific frequencies are S_N (NGC 3311) = 12. 5 +/- 1. 5 and S_N (NGC 3309) = 0. 6 +/- 0. 4. NGC 3311 is completely dominant and entirely comparable with other cD-type systems such as M 87 in Virgo. Comment: 15 pages, 15 figures. Accepted to the Astrophysical Journal.

40|$|We report Suzaku {{observations}} of the northern half of the <b>Hydra</b> A <b>cluster</b> out to ~ 1. 4 Mpc, reaching the virial radius. This is the first Suzaku {{observations of}} a medium-size (kT ~ 3 keV) cluster out to the virial radius. Two observations were conducted, north-west and north-east offsets, which continue in a filament direction and a void direction of the large-scale structure of the Universe, respectively. The X-ray emission and distribution of galaxies elongate in the filament direction. The temperature profiles in the two directions are mostly consistent with each other within the error bars and drop to 1. 5 keV at 1. 5 r_ 500. As observed by Suzaku in hot clusters, the entropy profile becomes flatter beyond r_ 500, in disagreement with the r^ 1. 1 relationship that is expected from accretion shock heating models. When scaled with the average intracluster medium (ICM) temperature, the entropy profiles of clusters observed with Suzaku are universal and do not depend on system mass. The hydrostatic mass values in the void and filament directions are in good agreement, and the Navarro, Frenk, and White universal mass profile represents the hydrostatic mass distribution up to ~ 2 r_ 500. Beyond r_ 500, the ratio of gas mass to hydrostatic mass exceeds {{the result of the}} Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe, and at r_ 100, these ratios in the filament and void directions reach 0. 4 and 0. 3, respectively. We discuss possible deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium at cluster outskirts. We derived radial profiles of the gasmass- to-light ratio and iron-mass-to-light ratio out to the virial radius. Within r_ 500, the iron-mass-to-light ratio of the <b>Hydra</b> A <b>cluster</b> was compared with those in other clusters observed with Suzaku.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{and evolution of}} dwarf galaxies is relatively difficult to understand because of their faint emission in all regimes that require large aperture telescopes. We intend to study the evolution of star forming dwarf galaxies in clusters. We selected Fornax and <b>Hydra</b> <b>clusters</b> to complement our previous study of Virgo. On the basis of available literature data, we selected ten star-forming candidates in Fornax and another ten objects in Hydra. We used Gemini South with GMOS to acquire H-alpha images necessary to detect star-forming regions in the two galaxy samples. We then performed long-slit spectroscopy for the brightest six candidates, to derive their chemical properties. Finally, we employed the VLT with HAWK-I to observe all galaxies in the K' band to derive their main physical properties. We studied the morphology of our two samples, finding five objects in Fornax and six in Hydra with structures {{consistent with those of}} star-forming dwarfs, i. e., dwarf irregulars (dIs) or blue compact dwarfs (BCDs). About four other objects are probably dwarf spirals, while three objects remained undetected in both visible and near infrared. On the basis of visible bright emission lines, we derived oxygen abundances for ten star-forming candidates with values between 8. 00 and 8. 78. Most fundamental properties of star-forming galaxies in Fornax and Hydra appear similar to corresponding properties of dIs and BCDs from Virgo and the Local Volume (LV). The luminosity-metallicity and metallicity-gas fraction relations in the LV and Virgo appear to be followed by Fornax and Hydra samples, suggesting that the chemical evolution of the two clusters seems consistent with the predictions from the closed box model, although larger samples are needed to investigate the role of possible environmental effects.

40|$|We {{perform a}} weak-lensing {{study of the}} nearby cool-core galaxy <b>clusters,</b> <b>Hydra</b> A ($z= 0. 0538 $) and A 478 ($z= 0. 0881 $), of which {{brightest}} cluster galaxies (BCGs) host powerful activities of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). For each cluster, the observed tangential shear profile is well described either by a single Navarro [...] Frenk [...] White model or a two-component model including the BCG as an unresolved point mass. For A 478, we determine the BCG and its host-halo masses from a joint fit to weak-lensing and stellar photometry measurements. We find that the choice of initial mass functions (IMFs) can introduce a factor of two uncertainty in the BCG mass, whereas the BCG host halo mass is well constrained by data. We perform a joint analysis of weak-lensing and stellar kinematics data available for the <b>Hydra</b> A <b>cluster,</b> which allows us to constrain the central mass profile without assuming specific IMFs. We find that the central mass profile ($r< 300 $kpc) determined from the joint analysis is in excellent agreement with those from independent measurements, including dynamical masses estimated from the cold gas disk component, X-ray hydrostatic total mass estimates, and the central stellar mass estimated based on the Salpeter IMF. The observed dark-matter fraction around the BCG for Hydra A {{is found to be}} smaller than those predicted by adiabatic contraction models, suggesting the importance of other physical processes, such as the the AGN feedback and/or dissipationless mergers.

40|$|Current high {{resolution}} observations of galaxy clusters reveal a dynamical intracluster medium (ICM). The wealth of structures includes signatures of interactions between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the ICM, such as cavities and shocks, {{as well as}} signatures of bulk motions, e. g. cold fronts. Aiming at understanding the physics of the ICM, we study individual clusters by both, deep {{high resolution}} observations and numerical simulations which include processes suspected to be at work, and aim at reproducing the observed properties. By comparing observations and simulations in detail, we gain deeper insights into cluster properties and processes. Here we present two examples of our approach: the large-scale shock in the <b>Hydra</b> A <b>cluster,</b> and sloshing cold fronts.
