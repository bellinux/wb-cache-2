40|$|Abstract only. The paper aims {{to present}} a {{comparative}} economic evaluation of different pond culture systems for <b>prawn</b> (Penaeus monodon) <b>and</b> <b>shrimp</b> (P. indicus <b>and</b> P. merguiensis) using standard economic tools and methods of analysis. The different culture systems include extensive and semi-intensive monoculture of <b>prawns</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrimps</b> <b>and</b> the extensive polyculture of these species with milkfish (Chanos chanos). Data used in the analysis were taken from both SEAFDEC AQD and industry experience. The technical data were gathered from researchers and private sector experiences in <b>prawn</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrimp</b> farming. Financial estimates were determined after the peculiarities of aquaculture vis-a-vis other business ventures in agriculture and industry were taken into consideration. The study shows that the extensive monoculture of <b>prawns</b> <b>and</b> the extensive polyculture of <b>prawn</b> with <b>shrimp</b> <b>and</b> milkfish are profitable culture systems. Return on investment (ROI) and payback period for prawn extensive monoculture systems range from 10 to 65 % and from 1. 4 to 8. 6 years, respectively. For polyculture systems, ROI ranges from 8 to 85 % and payback period from 1. 1 to 10. 5 years. The semi-intensive culture of prawn shows moderate results. This {{is largely due to}} higher capital requirements for semi-intensive culture as compared to extensive culture. The extensive and semi-intensive monoculture of shrimps on the other hand show poor results, with semi-intensive monoculture registering net losses after all costs are considered...|$|R

The bases of comparison include pond design characteristics, stocking density, food supply, water management, average production, technical, and other major input requirements. Common factors that may influence production for each system are also discussed. It is observed that <b>prawn</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrimp</b> production has been mainly characterized by the extensive system. Of the 200, 000 ha of brackishwater fishponds in the Philippines, about 25 % (50, 000 ha) are stocked with <b>prawns</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrimps</b> in monoculture or in polyculture with milkfish. Only a relatively small portion (less than 500 ha) of the area is utilized for semi-intensive culture. The dramatic increase in area utilization for extensive prawn production in recent years {{can be attributed to}} high market demand, increased hatchery-bred fry production, minimum technical requirements, and lower production cost and risks. The trend towards intensification among existing large fishfarms is hampered by rising capital costs for fishpond improvement and increasing operational expense and risks. However, intensification is gaining some attention and progress in limited areas, primarily to maximize utilization and production to avoid high investment cost of land for expansion. Further development and progress in the industry will be dependent on such factors as market price, availability of fry and feed at reasonable cost, supply of trained technicians, technical problems, financial situation, and economic viability of the operation...|$|R

Longer tails and banana species are highly valued. Peeling and breading to ease preparation obtain a high premium. Freezing, although commonly practiced, receives the highest discount among forms of preservation.
