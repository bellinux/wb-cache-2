5|$|Fans of Ultra {{were open}} about liking it {{and sent a}} {{significant}} amount of correspondence to Image and the Luna Brothers.

It extensively used character-centred shots, leading to what Lee described as an organic understanding of the character. It also featured on-screen sexual intercourse, framed in a medium shot, which Lee <b>intended</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sign and not simply a sex scene. Although Priceless, meant as a sequel to Subrosa, went through more than thirty drafts, it was ultimately cancelled despite interest from Alliance Atlantis and Citytv.|$|E

As it was not an FIA event, the car's illegality was not a factor. Nelson Piquet drove, coming fourth of the five cars competing.|$|E
