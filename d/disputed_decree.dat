50|$|The Trade <b>Dispute</b> <b>Decree</b> No.7 of 1976 {{set up the}} National Industrial Court; {{initially}} {{consisting of}} a president and four other members and a quorum {{of the president and}} two members. The initial jurisdiction of the court set forth in the Decree No.7 was dealing with trade union disputes and interpretation of collective bargaining agreements. From 1976 until 2006, the operations of the court was limited and its judgement barely respected. It operated on matters that emerged from arbitration or conciliatory labor disputes while it shared jurisdiction on most matters with the state and Federal High Court. The first president was Paul Atilade.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} conflict and conflict management in work environment. We say that in every work environment {{there is always the}} tendency for conflict to arise as long as people of different background interact. Conflict was found to be a universal phenomenon and so it is inevitable. What happens during the interaction of these people informed the need to investigate conflict and conflict management in work environment and its consequences. The epistemological bases of the discourse derive from the conceptual framework. The paper discusses the meaning of conflict, conflict management as well as possible causes of conflicts in work environment. It also looked at the dark side of conflict explaining the individual behavior under conflict situation. It was found that when we are in conflict, we tend to say things we do not mean and mean things we do not say, and that conflict arises when individual's expectation is negatively affected. We found that conflict is neither bad nor good depending on how it is handled. The paper peeped into available means of managing conflict in work environment which some involved statutory provisions of the Trade Union <b>Dispute</b> <b>Decree</b> 7 of 1976 in the case of Nigeria. It is not healthy not to experience conflict in work environment because it can be beneficial to the organization. The paper concludes that every forms of disaffection which leads to conflict in work environment should be eliminated...|$|R

40|$|Wydanie publikacji dofinansowane przez Komitet Badań NaukowychI have duelly {{analysed}} {{the role}} and impart of consequetive Nigerian governments on various aspects of trade-unionism and industrial relations in Nigeria from the year 1966 to the year 1998. I have therefore critically assessed the impact which these various governments have had on the Nigerian trade union movement during the 32 years of its existence. My analysis shows a definite and uncompromising policy of intervention and deep involvement {{in the affairs of}} Nigerian unions by mostly the various military governments which dominated Nigeria during the period analysed contary to what was the practice during the erstwhile civilian administration. For example on the negative side the ban on strikes from the year 1966 - 1979, but on the positive side however, several instances can be repeated from this publication where the military governments legislations and administrations were positively oriented toward the improvement of the trade unions, for example Decree (No. 36) of 1973, which gave effect to the Industrial Arbitration Tribunals award other examples are the trade union Decree of 1973 which compelled employers to accord recognition to any duly registered union and made illegal the use of funds in partisan parties also the trade <b>disputes</b> <b>decree</b> of 1976, which setup the National Industrial Court as the last institution in the apparatus for the settlement of trade disputes. But as noted the military never gave democracy any chance in Nigeria as noted they dominated in all affairs of the government by force to the day they finally left the Nigerian political stage in the year 1998. I duelly hope the present civilian government of Nigeria will make it it’s objective to correct all the wrongdoings of the military and lay a solid foundation for the Nigerian trade union movement.

5000|$|A decree of 23 December 1918 {{regulated}} wage agreements, {{laying down}} that a wage agreement {{that had been}} concluded in any branch of employment between the competent trade union authority and the competent employers’ authority had absolute validity, meaning that no employer could enter into any other agreement of his own initiative. In addition, an organisation of arbitral courts {{was set up to}} decide all <b>disputes.</b> A <b>decree</b> of 4 January 1919 compelled employers to reinstate their former labourers on demobilisation, while measures were devised to safeguard workers from arbitrary dismissal.

50|$|The {{election}} of the patriarch belonged to the Senate of Venice, and this practice sometimes led to differences between the republic and the Holy See. Likewise, parishioners elected their parish priests, by the right of patronage. Girolamo Quirini, O.P. (1519-54), had many disputes with the clergy, the Government, and the Holy See. To avoid these <b>disputes,</b> the Senate <b>decreed</b> that in future only senators should be eligible. Those elected after this were frequently laymen. Giovanni Trevisano, O.S.B. (1560), introduced the Tridentine reforms, founding the seminary, holding synods and collecting the regulations made by his predecessors (Constitutiones et privilegia patriarchatus et cleri Venetiarum). In 1581 the visita Apostolica was sent to Venice; a libellus exhortatorius was published, in which the visita highly praised the clergy of Venice.|$|R

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a perspective on}} two barriers created in the Brazilian legal system that were crucial for the stagnation of arbitration in Brazil. The anti-arbitration measures adopted from 1867 until 1996 were detrimental to the acceptance of arbitration as a common method of solving disputes in Brazil. Although the practice of arbitration in Brazil {{is not a new}} phenomenon – in fact, when Brazil was a colony of Portugal there were statutory provisions allowing the use of such alternative method of <b>dispute</b> resolution, two <b>Decrees</b> enacted in 1867 and 1878 provided a step back in the arbitration scenario. They determined that the arbitration agreement was a promise to submit disputes to arbitration instead of a contract to have future disputes arbitrated and that an international arbitral award had to be recognised in the jurisdiction where it was issued before its submission to recognition and enforcement in Brazil. However, Brazil overcame these impediments which, {{at the end of the}} last century, were repealed...|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{after twenty}} years of {{discussion}} public and private, and eighty-five conferences {{in the presence of}} the popes, the question was not solved but an end was put to the <b>disputes.</b> The pope's <b>decree</b> communicated on 5 September 1607 to both Dominicans and Jesuits, allowed each party to defend its own doctrine, enjoined each from censoring or condemning the opposite opinion, and commanded them to await, as loyal sons of the Church, the final decision of the Apostolic See. That decision, however, has not been reached, and both orders, consequently, could maintain their respective theories, just as any other theological opinion is held. The long controversy has aroused considerable feeling, and the pope, aiming at the restoration of peace and charity between the religious orders, forbade by a decree of the Inquisition (1 December 1611) the publication of any book concerning efficacious grace until further action by the Holy See. The prohibition remained in force during the greater part of the seventeenth century, although it was widely circumvented by the means of explicit commentaries of Thomas Aquinas.|$|R

I do not ask you to write, [...] nor to tell me whether you write, nor to make any reply to this [...] letter, beyond returning the inclosures in an envelope to me in [...] Downing Street. I will state briefly the grounds of my request, [...] thus limited. In 1844, when I was young as a cabinet minister, and [...] the government of Sir R. Peel was troubled with the O’Connell [...] manifestations, they made what I think was an appeal to Pope [...] Gregory XVI. for his intervention to discourage agitation in [...] Ireland. I should be very loath now to tender such a request at [...] Rome. But now a different case arises. Some members of the Roman [...] catholic priesthood in Ireland deliver certain sermons and [...] otherwise express themselves in the way which my inclosures [...] exhibit. I doubt whether if they were laymen {{we should not have}} [...] settled their cases by putting them into gaol. I need not describe [...] the sentiments uttered. Your eminence will feel them and judge [...] them as strongly as I do. But now as to the Supreme Pontiff. You [...] will hardly be surprised when I say that I regard him, if apprised [...] of the facts, as responsible for the conduct of these priests. For [...] I know perfectly well that he has the means of silencing them; and [...] that, if any one of them were in public to <b>dispute</b> the <b>decrees</b> of [...] the council of 1870 as plainly as he has denounced law and order, [...] he would be silenced.|$|R
2500|$|Since 1866 Chilean {{entrepreneurs}} José Santos Ossa and Francisco Puelma exploited {{deposits of}} sodium nitrate in Bolivian territories (salitreras [...] "Las Salinas" [...] and [...] "Carmen Alto" [...] and [...] from Antofagasta respectively) secured by concessions from the then President of Bolivia Mariano Melgarejo. Later, in 1868, British capital was associated and founded the Compañía Melbourne Clark. The company obtained {{a license to}} construct a railroad from Antofagasta to Salinas, and the company was renamed to Compañía de Salitres y Ferrocarril de Antofagasta (CSFA), with a minority of British capital of 34% [...] from the Antony Gibbs & Sons of London, which were also shareholder of salitreras in Peru. The company was established in Valparaíso, Chile. Its shareholders included a number of leading Chilean politicians. In 1871 a new Bolivian Government invalidated all contracts signed by Melgarejo. But on 22 November 1872 a Bolivian decree allowed the government to renegotiate the contracts, {{which is what the}} company and the Bolivian Government did. On 27 November 1873 the CSFA obtained from the Bolivian executive a license to exploit saltpeter duty-free for 15 years, but it was <b>disputed</b> whether the <b>decree</b> needed the authorization of the Bolivian Congress. Some lawyers placed emphasis on con cargo a dar cuenta a la próxima legislatura (Spanish for: [...] "to be accepted by the parliament"), while others on sólo en los casos de no avenimiento (Spanish for [...] "only in conflict cases").|$|R
