5|$|Each guest's {{positioning}} in {{the painting}} has its own meaning. In the foreground there is a dancer wearing the colours of that time period {{and there are many}} peasants in that area. In the middle there is the bride dancing with an older man, her <b>father.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> right of the work, there is a musician playing on a pijpzak, who is watching the dance from the side. Judging by the writing utensils hanging on his belt, he is a writer or possibly a middle-class painter. Behind him is a hanging tablecloth decorated with a crown and beneath it is the bride's table. Before her table, money collectors can be seen digging trenches while the wedding guests sit down and eat.|$|E

On February 17, 1841, he left home after a disagreement with his father and moved to Barnesville, Ohio. For four years he lived with the family of John Kelly, working as a blacksmith’s apprentice. Beginning in 1843, Deady attended Barnesville Academy, continuing his education there until four months beyond the time that his blacksmith apprenticeship ended. The apprenticeship had paid {{for the first six months}} of school. At the school he earned a certificate that allowed him to become a teacher on July 7, 1845, from his instructor Nathan R.

They presented aviation journalist Tim van Beveren, whom they had commissioned to publish a new report, which asserted that Lubitz could have fallen unconscious, that the cockpit door lock had malfunctioned on previous flights, and that potentially dangerous turbulence had been reported in the area {{on the day of the}} crash.

Arthur had left school by then and was helping his <b>father</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> farm. Joseph Brittan was heartbroken and there are indications that he went through a period of depression.

5|$|A {{few months}} later, the Emperor {{received}} word {{that his father}} had died on 10 March 1826, and that he had succeeded his <b>father</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese throne as King Dom PedroIV. Aware that a reunion of Brazil and Portugal would be unacceptable to the people of both nations, he hastily abdicated the crown of Portugal on 2 May in favor of his eldest daughter, who became Queen Dona MariaII. His abdication was conditional: Portugal was required to accept the Constitution which he had drafted and MariaII was to marry his brother Miguel. Regardless of the abdication, PedroI continued to act as an absentee king of Portugal and interceded in its diplomatic matters, as well as in internal affairs, such as making appointments. He found it difficult, at the very least, to keep his position as Brazilian emperor separate from his obligations to protect his daughter's interests in Portugal.|$|E

Establishing himself as a fisherman, Thomas Sr. achieved his mate and then skipper qualifications, entitling him to captain a fishing vessel sailing from the port. In 1902 he was taken on by Chambers, {{one of the largest}} boat owning families in Lowestoft, to crew and then captain their ketch George Borrow, in which he remained for thirteen years.

5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, Hansel (Lord) and Gretel (Collins), {{are searching}} for {{kindling}} while their father (Lea) chops firewood. He gives Gretel a compass so they won't be separated, but when they return, he {{is nowhere to be}} found. As they search they run into The Evil Queen (Parrilla) and are captured. She tells the two that she can help find their <b>father,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> condition that they retrieve an item belonging to her from The Blind Witch (Emma Caulfield). They must enter her gingerbread house when The Blind Witch is asleep and fetch The Evil Queen's leather satchel, but they must not eat a thing. They break in safely, but Hansel gives in to the temptation of taking a bite of a cupcake, causing The Blind Witch to wake up. While she cannot see the children, she can smell their scent. The Blind Witch locks them up and prepares the oven to roast them. The two, working together, are able to push the witch into her own oven as The Evil Queen, who is gleefully watching the events from her mirror, magically sends a bolt of fire through her mirror into the witch's oven, roasting her alive.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Piers Gaveston's early years; even his year of birth is unknown. He and Prince Edward of Caernarfon (born 25 April 1284) {{were said to be}} contemporaries (coetanei), so it can be assumed that he was born in or around 1284. Though one chronicle claims he {{accompanied}} his father to England in 1297, the first reliable reference to him is from Gascony later that year, when he served in the company of Edward I. In 1300 he sailed to England with his father and his older brother, Arnaud-Guillaume de Marsan. It was at this time that he {{became a member of the}} household of the young Prince Edward – the future Edward II. The King was apparently impressed by Gaveston's conduct and martial skills, and wanted him to serve as a model for his son. In 1304, the King awarded Gaveston the wardship of Roger Mortimer of Wigmore, after the death of Roger's <b>father,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> request of Edward, Prince of Wales. This put Gaveston in charge of Mortimer's possessions during the latter's minority, and served as proof of the King's confidence in his son's companion.|$|E

5|$|On the October 11 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Commissioner Shane McMahon and General Manager Daniel Bryan {{challenged}} Raw to three traditional Survivor Series elimination matches – involving each brand's best five male wrestlers, best five female wrestlers, and best five tag teams, respectively. The following week on Raw, Raw Commissioner Stephanie accepted the challenge. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Stephanie invited both Shane and Bryan {{to appear on}} the following week's Raw to address the interpromotional matches, which Shane and Bryan accepted. During this meeting, each commissioner and general manager touted the reasons for why their respective brand was better and eventually called out their respective male teams.

At Survivor Series, Team SmackDown defeated Team Raw, On the March 20 episode of Raw, Foley was fired as Raw General Manager for his actions.

5|$|Stephen succeeded his <b>father</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> throne {{following}} the latter's death in July 1463 {{and became the}} first Bosnian king to receive a crown from the Holy See. The kingdom's existence, however, was increasingly threatened by the Ottomans. King Stephen had the unanimous support of his noblemen in resistance to the Ottomans, but not of the common people. He maintained an active correspondence with Pope Pius II, who forgave him for the loss of Serbia and worked with him to preserve Bosnia for Christendom. The Hungarian king was placated, but all Western monarchs contacted by Stephen refused to assist him. Confident that at least Matthias would come to his aid, Stephen refused to deliver the customary tribute to the Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, which provoked an invasion. In May 1463, Mehmed marched into Bosnia, meeting little effective resistance, and captured Stephen, who was then beheaded. The execution marks the fall of the Kingdom of Bosnia to the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} in the pre-dawn hours as the young Nick Adams, his father, his uncle and their Indian guides row across a lake to a nearby Indian camp. Nick's father, a doctor, has been called out to deliver a baby {{for a woman who}} has been in labor for days. At the camp, they find the woman in a cabin lying on a bottom bunkbed; her husband lies above her with an injured foot. Nick's father is forced to perform a {{caesarian}} operation on the woman with a jack-knife because the baby is in the breech position; he asks Nick to assist by holding a basin. The woman screams throughout the operation, and when Nick's uncle tries to hold her down, she bites him. After the baby is delivered, Nick's father turns to the woman's husband on the top bunk and finds that he fatally slit his throat with a straight razor during the operation. Nick is sent out of the cabin, and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story ends with only Nick and his <b>father</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lake, rowing away from the camp. Nick asks his father questions about birth and death, and thinks to himself that he will never die, as he watches his father row.|$|E

On returning to Prussia he became an intimate of the crown prince, afterwards Frederick the Great, whom he later accompanied in the Rhine campaign of 1734. This intimacy, in view of his personal relations with the king, made Winterfeldt's position very difficult, for Frederick William and his son were badly estranged over the Katte Affair; eventually the prince was brought before a court-martial by his <b>father,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> charge of attempting to desert, and was condemned to death.
