5000|$|Polaroid Corporation invented and {{produced}} {{the widest range}} of instant film. Roll film was distributed in two separate negative and positive rolls and developed inside the camera. It was introduced in 1948 and was manufactured until 1992. Sheet film was introduced in 1958 for 4x5" [...] film holder #500. Each sheet contains a reagent pod, negative and receiving positive, and was loaded separately and developed outside the film holder. In 1973 Polaroid introduced 8x10" [...] Instant <b>film.</b> <b>Pack</b> film was distributed in a <b>film</b> <b>pack</b> which contained both negative and positive sheets and was developed outside the camera. It was introduced in 1963. Integral film is also distributed in a <b>film</b> <b>pack,</b> but each film envelope contains all the chemical layers to expose, develop, and fix the photo. It was introduced in 1972.|$|E

50|$|According {{to former}} Kodak {{employees}} at the Eastman House photographic museum, Kodak stopped producing film packs when the last employee trained to assemble them (which required working with the very sharp metal frame in total darkness) retired in the 1980s. This rendered all traditional <b>film</b> <b>pack</b> holders in the world obsolete at once. Polaroid film packs, though mechanically similar, are not (and never were) available in standard film sizes. The Fuji QuickChange system was {{sometimes referred to as}} a <b>film</b> <b>pack</b> system but, as noted above, was a mechanical multi-sheet holder.|$|E

40|$|Rancidity {{development}} during frozen storage (– 20 °C) {{of sierra}} fish (Scomberomorus sierra) was studied. Fillets were packed in low-density polyethylene films {{with and without}} butylated hydroxytoluene added (BHT-LDPE and LDPE respectively). Fillets stored with no package were used as control. Special attention {{was given to the}} effect of previous ice storage (0, 3, 6, 9 and 15 days) {{on the quality of the}} frozen fish. Physical (pH and texture) and chemical (peroxide value, PV and thiobarbituric acid index, TBA-i) analyses were carried out. Lipid oxidation increased with ice storage time in fish muscle without <b>film</b> <b>packing,</b> being greater than the <b>film</b> <b>packed</b> muscle (with and without antioxidant). An effect of previous ice storage time was observed on the frozen product (in all treatments). However, fish muscle with <b>film</b> <b>packing</b> containing antioxidant showed less lipid deterioration. Under the conditions applied in this study, the plastic films with antioxidant prevented the lipids oxidation during the cold handling of the sierra muscle...|$|R
5000|$|Graflex and Polaroid {{produced}} <b>film</b> <b>pack</b> holders {{that could}} be loaded in subdued light. Film packs were available from various film manufacturers in 12 and 16-sheet units. The classic <b>film</b> <b>pack</b> consisted of several [...] "sheets" [...] of film (actually much thinner than standard sheet film, as they were cut from large-format roll film, for economy and physical flexibility) taped together and wound {{in a series of}} S-bends around a metal frame. To [...] "advance" [...] the film, the user pulled a paper tab that protruded {{from the side of the}} <b>film</b> <b>pack.</b> The tab was attached—facing the opposite direction—to the junction of each sheet and its intervening section of tape. The thin film and only slight tension this system provided resulted in poor film flatness, and negatives are often sharp enough only for contact printing. They were primarily used by press photographers, and demand fell off dramatically as photojournalists converted to roll film cameras.|$|E

5000|$|Polaroid SX-70 {{film was}} {{introduced}} in 1972, and was a market success despite some problems with the batteries on early <b>film</b> <b>packs.</b> The original SX-70 film was improved once in the mid-1970s (New Improved Faster Developing!) and replaced in 1980 by the further advanced [...] "SX-70 Time-Zero Supercolor" [...] product, in which the layers in the film card were altered to allow a much faster development time (hence the [...] "time zero"). It also had richer, brighter colors than the original 1972 product. There were also professional market varieties of the SX-70 film including 778 (Time Zero equivalent) and the similar 708, Time Zero film without a battery, intended for use in applications such as the [...] "Face Place" [...] photo booth and professional or laboratory film-backs, where a battery is not needed.

50|$|Fuji's {{instant film}} {{products}} {{are based upon}} the improvements made to Polaroid's SX-70 instant film system that the Eastman Kodak Company sold in the 1970s and 1980s - namely the ability to expose the film through {{the rear of the}} photograph and the reversal of the dye layers' order so that development in the blue layer is visible first. As a result of these changes, the image {{does not need to be}} taken via a reflex mirror in order to reverse the image (as all Polaroid integral film cameras do). Colour balance and tonal range are also improved over Polaroid integral instant films. Fuji's decision to integrate the pressure plate springs and batteries into the camera bodies rather than the disposable <b>film</b> <b>pack</b> itself helps make the Instax system more economical per exposure than Polaroid's equivalents.|$|E
50|$|Pictures {{from the}} SX-70, by contrast, ejected {{automatically}} and developed quickly without chemical residue. Polaroid founder Edwin H. Land announced the SX-70 {{at a company}} annual meeting in April 1972. On stage, {{he took out a}} folded SX-70 from his suit coat pocket and in ten seconds took five pictures, both actions impossible with previous Land Cameras. The company first sold the SX-70 in Miami, Florida in late 1972, and began selling it nationally in fall 1973. Although the high cost of $180 for the camera and $6.90 for each <b>film</b> <b>pack</b> of ten pictures ($ and $, respectively, adjusted for inflation) limited demand, Polaroid sold 700,000 by mid-1974. In 1973 - 4, the Skylab 3 and 4 astronauts used an SX-70 to photograph a video display screen to be able to compare the Sun's features from one orbit to the next.|$|E

5000|$|The Speed Graphic {{was a slow}} camera. Setting {{the focal}} plane shutter speed {{required}} selecting both a slit width and a spring tension. Each exposure required the photographer to change the film holder, open the lens shutter, cock the focal plane shutter, remove the dark slide from the inserted film holder, focus the camera, [...] and release the focal plane shutter. Conversely, if the lens shutter were used, the focal plane shutter (on the Speed Graphic and Pacemaker Graphic models with both shutters) had to be opened prior to cocking using the [...] "T" [...] or TIME setting, and then releasing the shutter in the lens. If indoors, the photographer also had to change the flashbulb. Each film holder contained one or two pieces of sheet film {{which had to be}} loaded into the film holder in complete darkness. Faster shooting could be achieved with the Grafmatic film holder, which is a six sheet film [...] "changer" [...] that holds each sheet in a septum. [...] Even faster exposures could be taken if the photographer was shooting <b>film</b> <b>packs</b> of 12 exposures, or later 16 exposures (discontinued in the late 1970s). With <b>film</b> <b>packs</b> one could shoot as fast as one could pull the tab and cock the shutter, and <b>film</b> <b>packs</b> could be loaded in daylight. A roll film adapter that used 120 or 220 film was available for 2.25 x 3.25, 3.25 x 4.25 and 4 x 5 inch cameras that permitted 8 to 20 exposures per roll, depending on the model of the adapter. Photographers had to be conservative and anticipate when the action was about to take place to take the right picture. The cry, [...] "Just one more!" [...] if a shot was missed was common. President Harry Truman introduced the White House photographers as the [...] "Just One More Club." ...|$|R
5000|$|Chris Justice at Classic-Horror.com commented [...] "The {{music is}} also classic Carpenter, and {{although}} the composer actually scrapped his original score and rewrote it to better match the film's vibe, viewers benefit greatly from his acute sense of rhythm, composition, and tone.
