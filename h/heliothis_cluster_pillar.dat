On top of these runs the sloped cornice with a parapet in three panels of quatrefoil open-work.|$|R
60|$|After another {{glimpse at}} the cathedral, too, I realize how utterly I {{have failed in}} {{conveying}} the idea of its elaborate ornament, its twisted and <b>clustered</b> <b>pillars,</b> and numberless devices of sculpture; nor did I mention the venerable statues that stand all round {{the summit of the}} edifice, relieved against the sky,--the highest of all being one of the Saviour, on the topmost peak of the front; nor the tall tower that ascends {{from one side of the}} building, and is built of layers of black and white marble piled one upon another in regular succession; nor the dome that swells upward close beside this tower.|$|R

The fine arches with <b>clustered</b> <b>pillars</b> on which the tower rests are the glory of the church indoors, recalling the days when there were four guilds here, each guild keeping a light burning on these piers. Three of the four brackets for the lights are still here, one carved with a face and one a grotesque little fellow with his legs doubled behind him.|$|R
60|$|We {{entered through}} a side portal, {{and sat down}} on a bench in the nave, and kept {{ourselves}} quiet; for the organ was sounding, and the choristers were chanting in the choir. The nave and transepts are very noble, with <b>clustered</b> <b>pillars</b> and Norman arches, and a great height under the central tower; the whole, however, being covered with plaster and whitewash, except the roof, which is of painted oak. This latter adornment has the merit, I believe, of being veritably ancient; but certainly I should prefer the oak of its native hue, for the effect of the paint is to make it appear as if the ceiling were covered with imitation mosaic-work or an oil-cloth carpet.|$|R

6000|$|October 5th.--I {{have been}} {{two or three times}} into the cathedral; [...] . the whole {{interior}} is of marble, in alternate lines of black and white, each layer being about eight inches in width and extending horizontally. It looks very curiously, and might remind the spectator of a stuff with horizontal stripes. Nevertheless, the effect is exceedingly rich, these alternate lines stretching away along the walls and round the <b>clustered</b> <b>pillars,</b> seen aloft, and through the arches; everywhere, this inlay of black and white. Every sort of ornament that could be thought of seems to have been crammed into the cathedral in one place or another: gilding, frescos, pictures; a roof of blue, spangled with golden stars; a magnificent wheel-window of old painted glass over the entrance, and another {{at the opposite end of}} the cathedral; statues, some of marble, others of gilded bronze; pulpits of carved marble; a gilded organ; a cornice of marble busts of the popes, extending round the entire church; a pavement, covered all over with a strange kind of mosaic work in various marbles, wrought into marble pictures of sacred subjects; immense <b>clustered</b> <b>pillars</b> supporting the round arches that divide the nave from the side aisles; a clere-story of windows within pointed arches;--it seemed as if the spectator were reading an antique volume written in black-letter of a small character, but conveying a high and solemn meaning. I can find no way of expressing its effect on me, so quaint and venerable as I feel this cathedral to be in its immensity of striped waistcoat, now dingy with five centuries of wear. I ought not to say anything that might detract from the grandeur and sanctity of the blessed edifice, for these attributes are really uninjured by any of the Gothic oddities which I have hinted at.|$|R

60|$|That {{morning in}} the long {{galleries}} of the bishop's imagination a fresh painting had been added. It was a big wall painting rather {{in the manner of}} Puvis de Chavannes. And the central figure had been the bishop of Princhester himself. He had been standing upon the steps of the great door of the cathedral that looks upon the marketplace where the tram-lines meet, and he had been dressed very magnificently and rather after the older use. He had been wearing a tunicle and dalmatic under a chasuble, a pectoral cross, purple gloves, sandals and buskins, a mitre and his presentation ring. In his hand he had borne his pastoral staff. And the <b>clustering</b> <b>pillars</b> and arches of the great doorway were painted with a loving flat particularity that omitted nothing but the sooty tinge of the later discolourations.|$|R

In this paper, we have performed a statistical {{study of the}} average light transmission, over the range of wavelengths 450 - 1400 nm, for two-dimensional photonic structures with different homogeneity (quantified by the Shannon index). The photonic structure is a square lattice of circular pillars and the homogeneity is varied by <b>clustering</b> <b>pillars</b> in the crystal unit cells. We have calculated the light transmission for 50 different crystal realizations (permutating cluster position in the crystal) for each Shannon index value. Such Monte Carlo Markov Chain method produced the "a posteriori" distribution of the light transmission. We have observed a linear trend of the average transmission {{as a function of}} the crystal homogeneity. Furthermore, we have found a linear dependence of the average light transmission on the mean distance between pillars in the photonic structures...|$|R
50|$|The other church, St James's Church, {{is quite}} elaborate. It {{was built in}} 1874, {{completed}} in 1880, by the third Earl of Eldon, the architect was George Edmund Street (1824-1881). St James's Church resembles a miniature of an early English cathedral. It is a cruciform building, with an apse, central tower and narthex, built throughout of Purbeck stone. Its tower dominates the landscape. The tower, which is somewhat disproportionate in size {{to the rest of}} the church, was made large enough to contain a full peal of eight bells, which were cast and installed by John Taylor & Co., of Loughborough, in 1880. Inside the <b>clustered</b> <b>pillars</b> and other details are made of Purbeck marble, quarried from Lord Eldon’s estate and worked by his own craftsmen. It did not replace the existing church immediately and in effect for over forty years it was the private chapel of the Eldon family.|$|R
6000|$|October 11th.--Again I went to {{the cathedral}} this morning, and spent an hour {{listening}} to the music and looking through the orderly intricacies of the arches, where many vistas open away among the columns of the choir. There are five clustered columns {{on each side of}} the nave; then under the dome there are two more arches, not in a straight line, but forming the segment of a circle; and beyond the circle of the dome there are four more arches, extending to the extremity of the chancel. I should have said, instead of [...] "clustered columns" [...] as above, that there are five arches along the nave supported by columns. This cathedral has certainly bewitched me, to write about it so much, effecting nothing with my pains. I should judge the width of each arch to be about twenty feet, and the thickness of each <b>clustered</b> <b>pillar</b> is eight; or ten more, and the length of the entire building may be between two and three hundred feet; not very large, certainly, but it makes an impression of grandeur independent of size.

60|$|If {{the peace}} of the simple village had moved the child more strongly, because of the dark and troubled ways that lay beyond, and through which she had journeyed with such failing feet, what was the deep {{impression}} of finding herself alone in that solemn building, where the very light, coming through sunken windows, seemed old and grey, and the air, redolent of earth and mould, seemed laden with decay, purified by time of all its grosser particles, and sighing through arch and aisle, and <b>clustered</b> <b>pillars,</b> like the breath of ages gone! Here was the broken pavement, worn, so long ago, by pious feet, that Time, stealing on the pilgrims' steps, had trodden out their track, and left but crumbling stones. Here were the rotten beam, the sinking arch, the sapped and mouldering wall, the lowly trench of earth, the stately tomb on which no epitaph remained--all--marble, stone, iron, wood, and dust--one common monument of ruin. The best work and the worst, the plainest and the richest, the stateliest and the least imposing--both of Heaven's work and Man's--all found one common level here, and told one common tale.|$|R
60|$|Raised {{several feet}} above the pavement, against every <b>clustered</b> <b>pillar</b> along the nave of the cathedral, is placed a statue of Gothic sculpture. In various places are sitting statues of popes of Sienese nativity, all of whom, I believe, have a hand raised {{in the act of}} blessing. Shrines and chapels, set in grand, heavy frames of {{pillared}} architecture, stand all along the aisles and transepts, and these seem in many instances to have been built and enriched by noble families, whose arms are sculptured on the pedestals of the pillars, sometimes with a cardinal's hat above to denote the rank of one of its members. How much pride, love, and reverence in the lapse of ages must have clung to the sharp points of all this sculpture and architecture! The cathedral is a religion in itself, --something worth dying for to those who have an hereditary interest in it. In the pavement, yesterday, I noticed the gravestone of a person who fell six centuries ago in the battle of Monte Aperto, and was buried here by public decree as a meed of valor.|$|R

60|$|July 1st.--Immediately {{after our}} arrival yesterday, {{we went out}} and inquired our way to the cathedral, which we reached through a good deal of Scotch dirt, and a rabble of Scotch people of all sexes and ages. The women of Scotland have a faculty of looking {{exceedingly}} ugly as they grow old. The cathedral I have already noticed in the record of my former visit to Scotland. I did it no justice then, nor shall do it any better justice now; but it is a fine old church, although it makes a colder and severer impression than most of the Gothic architecture which I have elsewhere seen. I do not know why this should be so; for portions of it are wonderfully rich, and everywhere there are arches opening beyond arches, and <b>clustered</b> <b>pillars</b> and groined roofs, and vistas, lengthening along the aisles. The person who shows it is an elderly man of jolly aspect and demeanor; he is enthusiastic about the edifice, and makes it the thought and object of his life; and being such a merry sort of man, always saying something mirthfully, and yet, in all his thoughts, words, and actions, having reference to this solemn cathedral, he has the effect of one of the corbels or gargoyles,--those ludicrous, strange sculptures which the Gothic architects appended to their arches.|$|R
60|$|But as yet, that Friday {{afternoon}}, {{there was}} no hurry, and, instead of setting about a search for lodgings at once, we drove up into the town, {{as soon as we}} had tea, and visited York Minster while it was still the gray afternoon and not yet the gray evening. I thought the hour fortunate, and I do not see yet how we could have chosen a better hour out of the whole twenty-four, for the inside or the outside of the glorious fane, the grandest and beautifulest in all England, as I felt then and I feel now. If I were put to the question and were forced to say in what its supreme grandeur and beauty lay, I should perhaps say in its most ample simplicity. No doubt it is full of detail, but I keep no sense of this from that mighty interior, with its tree-like, <b>clustered</b> <b>pillars,</b> and its measureless windows, like breadths of stained foliage in autumnal woodlands. You want the scale of nature for the Minster at York, and I cannot liken it to less than all-out-doors. Some cathedrals, like that of Wells, make you think of gardens; but York Minster will not be satisfied with less than an autumnal woodland, where the trees stand in clumps, with grassy levels about them, and with spacious openings to the sky, that let in the colored evening light.|$|R

60|$|Inside of the minster {{there is}} a long and lofty nave, transepts of the same height, and side-aisles and chapels, dim nooks of holiness, where in Catholic times the lamps were {{continually}} burning before the richly decorated shrines of saints. In the audacity of my ignorance, as I humbly acknowledge it to have been, I criticised this great interior as too much broken into compartments, and shorn of half its rightful impressiveness by the interposition of a screen betwixt the nave and chancel. It did not spread itself in breadth, but ascended to the roof in lofty narrowness. One large body of worshippers might have knelt down in the nave, others in each of the transepts, and smaller ones in the side-aisles, besides an indefinite number of esoteric enthusiasts in the mysterious sanctities beyond the screen. Thus it seemed to typify the exclusiveness of sects rather than the worldwide hospitality of genuine religion. I had imagined a cathedral with a scope more vast. These Gothic aisles, with their groined arches overhead, supported by <b>clustered</b> <b>pillars</b> in long vistas up and down, were venerable and magnificent, but included too much of the twilight of that monkish gloom out of which they grew. It is no matter whether I ever came to a more satisfactory appreciation of this kind of architecture; the only value of my strictures being to show the folly of looking at noble objects in the wrong mood, and the absurdity of a new visitant pretending to hold any opinion whatever on such subjects, instead of surrendering himself to the old builder's influence with childlike simplicity.|$|R
50|$|The temple {{stands on}} an ornate base (pitha). The {{building}} includes a sanctum, a vestibule, and two halls (gudha-mandapa and mukha-mandapa). The sanctum has a circumambulatory path with three transepts. The gudha-mandapa has lateral transepts, and four clusters of pillars; each <b>cluster</b> contains four <b>pillars.</b> The vestibule has four pillars in a row, which are {{aligned with the}} four clusters of the gudha-mandapa. The shikhara (tower) of the shrine makes it around 30 m high.|$|R
6000|$|In {{another part}} of the High Street, up a pretty steep slope, and on one side of a public green, near an edifice which I think is a medical college, stands St. Mungo's Cathedral. It is hardly of cathedral dimensions, though a large and fine old church. The price of a ticket of {{admittance}} is twopence; so small that it might be as well to make the entrance free. The interior is in excellent repair, with the nave and side aisles, and <b>clustered</b> <b>pillars,</b> and intersecting arches, that belong to all these old churches; and a few monuments along the walls. I was going away without seeing any more than this; but the verger, a friendly old gentleman, with a hearty Scotch way of speaking, told me that the crypts were what chiefly interested strangers; and so he guided me down into the foundation-story of the church, where there is an intricacy and entanglement of immensely massive and heavy arches, supporting the structure above. The view through these arches, among the great shafts of the columns, was very striking. In the central part is a monument; a recumbent figure, if I remember rightly, but it is not known whom it commemorates. There is also a monument to a Scotch prelate, which seems to have been purposely defaced, probably in Covenant times. These intricate arches were the locality of one of the scenes in [...] "Rob Roy," [...] when Rob gives Frank Osbaldistone some message or warning, and then escapes from him into the obscurity behind. In one corner is St. Mungo's well, secured with a wooden cover; but I should not care to drink water that comes from among so many old graves.|$|R
6000|$|It {{stands in}} the midst of a small open space,--or a space that looks small in {{comparison}} with the vast bulk of the cathedral. I was not so much impressed by its exterior as I have usually been by Gothic buildings; because it is rectangular in its general outline and in its towers, and seems to lack the complexity and mysterious plan which perplexes and wonder-strikes me in most cathedrals. Doubtless, however, if I had known better how to admire it, I should have found it wholly admirable. At all events, it has a satisfactory hugeness. Seeking my way in, I at first intruded upon the Registry of Deeds, which occupies a building patched up against the mighty side of the cathedral, and hardly discernible, so small the one and so large the other. I finally hit upon the right door, and I felt no disappointment in my first glance around at the immensity of enclosed space;--I see now in my mind's eye a dim length of nave, a breadth in the transepts like a great plain, and such an airy height beneath the central tower that a worshipper could certainly get a good way towards heaven without rising above it. I only wish that the screen, or whatever they call it, between the choir and nave, could be thrown down, so as to give us leave to take in the whole vastitude at once. I never could understand why, after building a great church, they choose to sunder it in halves by this mid-partition. But let me be thankful for what I got, and especially for the height and massiveness of the <b>clustered</b> <b>pillars</b> that support the arches on which rests the central tower. I remember at Furness Abbey I saw two tall pillars supporting a broken arch, and thought it, the most majestic fragment of architecture that could possibly be. But these pillars have a nobler height, and these arches a greater sweep. What nonsense to try to write about a cathedral! ...|$|R
60|$|We next {{went to the}} Temple Church, and, {{finding the}} door ajar, made free to enter beneath its Norman arches, which {{admitted}} us into a circular vestibule, very ancient and beautiful. In {{the body of the}} church beyond we saw a boy sitting, but nobody either forbade or invited our entrance. On the floor of the vestibule lay about half a score of Templars,--the representatives of the warlike priests who built this church and formerly held these precincts,--all in chain armor, grasping their swords, and with their shields beside them. Except two or three, they lay cross-legged, in token that they had really fought for the Holy Sepulchre. I think I have seen nowhere else such well-preserved monumental knights as these. We proceeded into the interior of the church, and were greatly impressed with its wonderful beauty,--the roof springing, as it were, in a harmonious and accordant fountain, out of the <b>clustered</b> <b>pillars</b> that support its groined arches; and these pillars, immense as they are, are polished like so many gems. They are of Purbeck marble, and, if I mistake not, had been covered with plaster for ages until latterly redeemed and beautified anew. But the glory of the church is its old painted windows; and, positively, those great spaces over the chancel appeared to be set with all manner of precious stones,--or {{it was as if the}} many-colored radiance of heaven were breaking upon us,--or as if we saw the wings of angels, storied over with richly tinted pictures of holy things. But it is idle to talk of this marvellous adornment; it is to be seen and wondered at, not written about. Before we left the church, the porter made his appearance, in time to receive his fee,-- which somebody, indeed, is always ready to stretch out his hand for. And so ended our visit to the Temple, which, by the by, though close to the midmost bustle of London, is as quiet as if it were always Sunday there.|$|R

60|$|Worcester Cathedral {{would have}} {{impressed}} me much had I seen it earlier; though its aspect is less venerable {{than that of}} Chester or Lichfield, having been faithfully renewed and repaired, and stone-cutters and masons were even now {{at work on the}} exterior. At our first visit, we found no entrance; but coming again at ten o'clock, when the service was to begin, we found the door open, and the chorister-boys, in their white robes, standing in the nave and aisles, with elder people in the same garb, and a few black-robed ecclesiastics and an old verger. The interior of the cathedral has been covered with a light-colored paint at some recent period. There is, as I remember, very little stained glass to enrich and bedim the light; and the effect produced is a naked, daylight aspect, unlike what I have seen in any other Gothic cathedral. The plan of the edifice, too, is simple; a nave and side aisles, with great <b>clustered</b> <b>pillars,</b> from which spring the intersecting arches; and, somehow or other, the venerable mystery which I have found in Westminster Abbey and elsewhere does not lurk in these arches and behind these pillars. The choir, no doubt, is richer and more beautiful; but we did not enter it. I remember two tombs, with recumbent figures on there, between the pillars that divide the nave from the side aisles, and there were also mural monuments,--one, well executed, to an officer slain in the Peninsular war, representing him falling from his horse; another by a young widow to her husband, with an inscription of passionate grief, and a record of her purpose finally to sleep beside him. He died in 1803. I did not see on the monument any record of the consummation of her purpose; and so perhaps she sleeps beside a second husband. There are more antique memorials than these two on the wall, and I should have been interested to examine them; but the service was now about to begin in the choir, and at the far-off end of the nave the old verger waved his hand to banish us from the cathedral. At the same time he moved towards us, probably to say that he would show it to us after service; but having little time, and being so moderately impressed with what I had already seen, I took my departure, and so disappointed the old man of his expected shilling or half-crown. The tomb of King John is somewhere in this cathedral.|$|R

The principle is based on the ability of a catalyst surface site to accept a ingle electron from an electron donor like perylene to form charge transfer complexes and the amount of adsorbed species is measured quantitatively by UV-vis spectroscopy. Fina 1, an attempt has been made to correlate the acidity determined by the two independcnt methods and the catalytic activity of present systems in the benzoylation of toluene with benzoyl chloride. Incorporation of Fe and Cr has changed the properties of AI pitlared montmorillonite. Fe pillared systems {{have been found to be}} vcry good catalysts for benzoylation reaction. Extensive research on pillared smectites has proven their applications in the field of heterogeneous catalysis and adsorption l. 5. Several studies have shown that pillared clays with single metal oxide <b>clusters</b> as <b>pillars</b> in the inter layer region are active catalysts for cracking reactions, alkylation reaction...|$|R

Our approach is {{based on the idea that}} local creative knowledge can be used in the production of a valuable tourist experience. Since the main components of creative knowledge are heritage, identity, material culture, lifestyle and savoir faire, the local issue is clearly very important. However, local creative knowledge needs to be embedded into a full-fledged economic production process in order to become a development asset for the community. The possibility of defending and strengthening creative <b>clusters</b> as <b>pillars</b> of tourist production faces two major challenges: the structure of the market to which it is directed (tourism), and the global development of the world economy, which tends to disenfranchise production processes from locally embedded knowledge, dissipating place advantages. The viability of a process of “commodification” of creative knowledge can then be viewed in the light of such turbulent environment, focusing on regions where the pressure to market local resources to visitors is higher. There especially, a specific tool as the institution of Collective Intellectual Property Rights on culture-based goods and landscape elements may contribute towards the stated aims...|$|R
