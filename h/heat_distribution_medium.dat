In the experiment, as an ultrasound source, a piezoelectric transducer which has 28 KHz resonance frequency was used. Transducer was placed behind heat source and ran in sweeping mode from frequency 28 985 Hz to 27 397 Hz at about 20 W power. 50 Ω chrome-nickel resistance heater wire of a hairdryer was used under 220 V AC voltage as a heat source and its power is adjusted about 100 W by a dimmer.

For isothermal resin infiltration, the model incorporates submodels which describe cure of the resin and changes in resin viscosity due to cure, resin flow through the reinforcement preform and <b>distribution</b> <b>medium</b> and compaction of the preform during the infiltration.

40|$|For better {{characterizing the}} <b>heat</b> <b>distribution</b> of data centers, Multi-zone Model are {{considered}} in this paper, modularizing {{the cold and}} hot aisle space of a data center into several regular modules. Upon studying the thermal transmission between every two modules, the <b>heat</b> <b>distribution</b> of all cold and hot aisles in a data center was figured out. Firstly, while considering the thermal transmission, Multi-zone Heat-mass Balanced Model, a model improved from a traditional one, was established. Three modules, which are wall flow module, thermal plume module and thermal transmission module, consists the model. The model characterizes the thermal transmission in both vertical and horizontal direction by integrating the heat conduction of walls, wall convective heat exchange and convective heat exchange among sub-regions. Then, Multi-zone <b>Heat</b> <b>Distribution</b> Model were built by combining the established modules, wall flow module, thermal plume module and thermal transmission module, with Heat-mass Balanced Model.

40|$|A {{district}} heating (DH) system {{is one of}} the most important components of infrastructures in cold areas. Proper DH network design should balance the initial investment and the <b>heat</b> <b>distribution</b> cost of the DH network. Currently, this design is often based on a recommended value for specific pressure loss (R = ∆P/L) in the main lines. This will result in a feasible network design, but probably not be optimal in most cases. The paper develops a novel optimization model to facilitate the design by considering the initial investment in the pipes and the <b>heat</b> <b>distribution</b> costs. The model will generate all possible network scenarios consisting of different series of diameters for each pipe in the flow direction of the network. Then, the annuity on the initial investment, the <b>heat</b> <b>distribution</b> cost, and the total annual cost will be calculated for each network scenario, taking into account the uncertainties of the material prices and the yearly operating time levels. The model is applied to a sample DH network and the results indicate that the model works quite well, clearly identifying the optimal network design and demonstrating that the <b>heat</b> <b>distribution</b> cost is more important than the initial investment in DH network design...|$|R

This vehicle is spherically blunted, 12. 84 deg/ 7 deg biconic with the fore-cone bent upward 7 deg to provide self-trim capability. A straight biconic with the same nose radius and the same half-angles was also tested. The free-stream Reynolds numbers based on model length were equal to about 2 x 10 (5) or 9 x 10 (5). The angle of attack, referenced to the aft-cone, was varied from 0 deg to 20 deg. <b>Heating</b> <b>distributions</b> predicted with a parabolized Navier-Stokes (PNS) code are compared with the measurements for the present Reynolds numbers and range of angles of attack.
