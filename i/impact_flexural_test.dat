In {{order to}} {{determine}} the impact resistance of lightweight aggregate concrete (LWC), especially the effect of steel fibers on impact resistance of LWC, a series of drop-weight tests, recommended by the ACI committee 544, have been carried out in the present study. <b>Impact</b> and <b>flexural</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out on lightweight aggregate concrete reinforced with five different percentages of steel fibers 0. 0 %, 0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, 1. 5 % and 2. 0 % by volume of concrete.

These resins were then used to prepare thermosets and composites reinforced with sisal fibers. Different techniques were used to characterize raw materials and/or thermosets and composites, including inverse gas chromatography, thermogravimetric analysis, and mechanical <b>impact</b> and <b>flexural</b> <b>tests.</b> The substitution of phenol by sodium lignosulfonate in the formulation of the composite matrices increased the impact strength of the respective composites from approximately 400 Jm(- 1) to 800 J m(- 1) and 1000 J m(- 1), showing a considerable enhancement from the {{replacement of}} phenol with sodium lignosulfonate. The wettability of the sisal fibers increased when the resins were prepared from sodium lignosulfonate, generating composites in which the adhesion at the fiber-matrix interface was stronger and favored the transference of load from the matrix to the fiber during impact. Results suggested that the composites experienced a different mechanism of load transfer from the matrix to the fiber when a bending load was applied, compared to that experienced during impact. The thermogravimetric analysis results demonstrated that the thermal stability of the composites was not affected by the use of sodium lignosulfonate as a phenolic-type reagent during the preparation of the matrices.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to evaluate quantitatively and comparatively the effect of embedding optical fibers (OF) on the mechanical behavior of a carbon fiber-epoxy composite in order to verify whether their presence can possibly degrade the mechanical performance of the host material. The existing literature on this subject is not conclusive {{about the nature and}} intensity of this effect. Adding more reliable data to our systematic study contributes to this discussion favoring the conclusion about a harmful influence as a consequence of optical fiber embedment. Three kinds of mechanical tests have been performed in this work: <b>impact</b> <b>tests,</b> static <b>flexural</b> <b>tests,</b> and fatigue tests. The results of some experiments point to a possible detrimental influence related to the presence of the OF, being it different in nature and intensity for each of these tests. The mechanical behavior in static loading conditions seems to be not significantly affected {{as a consequence of the}} presence of the OF, while that in impact and fatigue tests are strongly affected, even though this influence being physically distinct from each other. Based on these results, some discussion is made about the possible failure mechanisms that can explain the detected differences.
