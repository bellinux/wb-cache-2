The number of organisms implicated in hyalohyphomycosis is increasing and the most clinically important species belong to the genera Fusarium, Scedosporium, Acremonium, Scopulariopsis, Purpureocillium and Paecilomyces. Severely immunocompromised patients are particularly vulnerable to infection, and clinical manifestations range from colonization to chronic localized lesions to acute invasive and/or disseminated diseases.

Therapy should include voriconazole and surgical debridement where possible or posaconazole as salvage treatment.

40|$|A novel panfungal PCR assay which detects the small-subunit rRNA gene {{sequence}} {{of the two major}} fungal organism groups was used to test whole-blood specimens obtained from a series of blood or bone marrow transplant recipients. The 580 -bp PCR product was identified after amplification by panfungal primers and hybridization to a 245 -bp digoxigenin-labeled probe. The lower limit of detection of the assay was approximately four organisms per milliliter of blood. Multiple whole-blood specimens from five patients without fungal infection or colonization had negative PCR results. Specimens from 11 infected patients had positive PCR results. Blood from three patients with pulmonary aspergillosis had positive PCR results: one patient’s blood specimen obtained in the week prior to the diagnosis of infection by a positive bronchoalveolar lavage fluid culture result was positive by PCR, and blood specimens obtained from two patients 1 to 2 days after lung biopsy and which were sterile by culture were positive by PCR.
