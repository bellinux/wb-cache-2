5|$|The Hotel Valley Ho is a {{striking}} example of the mid-century modern architectural style. Varney's use of masonry, cast and poured concrete, natural stone, and wide expanses of glass make for a close connection between the building and its environment. Stone floor and wall patterns link the exterior entry and the lobby, as does {{the extension of the}} redwood ceiling. The hotel is now considered one of the finest examples of organic architecture. Rooms in the two adjacent wings added in the late 1950s are unusual, and remarkably forward-thinking even by mid-century <b>design</b> <b>standards,</b> for their high nine-foot-ceilings. The prevailing trend at the time of original construction was low-ceilinged rooms, in some cases with ceilings only seven feet above ground level, but the Valley Ho's rooms feel exceptionally roomy and airy thanks to its original decision to buck design trends.|$|E

These <b>design</b> <b>standards</b> have been applied to London Overground stations, signage, rolling stock and publicity. London Overground also uses the TfL corporate typeface, New Johnston, on its signage, publicity, stationery and on its fleet of trains. In common with other TfL services, the Overground is denoted by its own colour, a vivid orange (Pantone 158C). The use of an orange colour was inherited from the former East London line prior to its transfer from Underground to Overground.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper seeks to: {{identify}} {{the importance of}} a <b>design</b> <b>standard</b> for tactile ground surface indicators (TGSIs); discuss the problem of the existing standard of TGSIs in China; and advocate an all-round approach that the consideration of a <b>design</b> <b>standard</b> of TGSIs should be on policy, implementation and management perspectives. Design/methodology/approach: TGSIs in China were taken as a case study, while those in other countries/cities were used as supplementary reference cases. Intensive field observations on the quality of TGSIs in various public places were carried out in the Chinese mainland between 2005 and 2009. The public places included transportation terminals, shopping centres and universities. The research activities included intensive field observations and direct interviews. Different types of TGSIs were reviewed by using product analysis methods. Findings: For inclusion, a standard for TGSIs is important. It is an effective tool in design quality assurance. There are three perspectives to ensuring the quality of a design standard: policy, implementation, and management. Research limitations/implications: Further case studies are expected to be conducted in other cities in order to generate a more comprehensive understanding related to the topic. Continuous studies are also necessary since the living environment is changing all the time. The general public's participation to establish a good <b>design</b> <b>standard</b> for TGSIs is important. Practical implications: The findings provide reference and direction for an all-round approach consideration in a <b>design</b> <b>standard</b> for TGSIs; and for social inclusion. Social implications: The findings illustrate how inclusion can be achieved by setting up a <b>design</b> <b>standard</b> of TGSIs in China (as a case study) by considering an all-round perspective. Originality/value: The work and study are new in China. The findings provide insights for China and other countries, and individual cities, to review the needs of visually impaired persons.

25|$|It {{would take}} {{nearly four decades}} to {{complete}} from the initial parkway proposal by TSPC chair Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1925 {{to the opening of}} the last segment in 1963, due in part to a lengthy hiatus resulting from World War II. Construction technology and highway <b>design</b> <b>standards</b> changed during the construction of the road, changes whose effect is still visible to drivers today. Since its completion it has been renovated, particularly in Dutchess and Westchester counties, reflecting the change in its role from park access route and scenic drive to important regional transportation artery.|$|E
