6000|$|Daun, {{picking his}} steps and positions, latterly with {{threefold}} precaution, got into Konigsgratz neighborhood, {{a week after}} Friedrich; and looked down with enigmatic wonder upon Friedrich's new settlement there. Forage abundant all round, and the corn-harvest growing white;--here, strange to say, has Friedrich got planted in the inside of those innumerable Daun redoubts, and [...] "woods of abatis;" [...] and might make a very pretty [...] "Bohemian Campaign" [...] of it, after all, were Daun the only adversary he had! Judges are of opinion, that Daun, with all his superiority of number, could not have disrooted Friedrich this season. [Tempelhof, ii. 170-176, 185;--who, unluckily, in soldier fashion, here as too often elsewhere, does not give us the Arithmetical Numbers of each, but counts by [...] "Battalions" [...] and [...] "Squadrons," [...] which, except in time of Peace, are a totally uncertain quantity:--guess vaguely, 75,000 against 30,000.] Daun did try him by the Pandour methods, [...] "1,000 Croats stealing in upon Konigsgratz at one in the morning," [...] and the like; but these availed nothing. By the one effectual method, that of beating him in battle, Daun never would have tried. What did <b>disroot</b> Friedrich, then?--Take the following dates, and small hints of phenomena {{in other parts of}} the big Theatre of War. [...] "Konitz" [...] is a little Polish Town, midway between Dantzig and Friedrich's Dominions:-- ...|$|E

5000|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{internal}} structure of the TAK, and apparently not even the Turkish secret service MİT succeeded in elucidating the organization. An employee of the later banned Kurdish German news agency MHA told Süddeutsche Zeitung in 2005 that representatives of the TAK would always remain anonymous and tight-lipped. The Freedom Hawks recruited a new generation of [...] "frustrated young Kurds", raised in the slums of Istanbul, Izmir and Ankara, after their parents had to flee their Kurdish villages in the 1990s. Other Kurdish observers saw the Freedom Hawks as a socially <b>disrooted</b> youth, a new urban guerilla born out of despair.|$|R
6000|$|GRAND CORDON DISRUPTED: ERFURT COUNTRY, 16th FEBRUARY-2d MARCH. [...] "About {{six weeks}} after this Frankfurt achievement, certain Reichsfolk and Austrian Auxiliaries are {{observed}} to be cutting down endless timber, '18,800 palisades, 6,000 trees of 60 feet,' and other huge furnishings, from the poor Duke of Gotha's woods; evidently meaning to fortify themselves in Erfurt. Upon which Prince Henri detaches a General Knobloch thitherward, Duke Ferdinand contributing 4,000 to meet him there; which combined expedition, after some sharp knocking and shoving, entirely <b>disrooted</b> the Austrians and Reichsfolk, and sent them packing. Had them quite torn out {{by the end of}} the month; and had planned to 'attack them on two sides at once' (March 2d), with a view of swallowing them whole,--when they (these Reichs Volscians, in such a state of flutter) privately hastened off, one and all of them, the day before."

Old General Lehwald, {{marching in}} the hollow ground near Habelschwert (hollow of the young Neisse River, twenty miles south of Glatz), with intent to cut that Country free; the Enemy, whom he is in search of, appears in great force,--posted on the uphill ground ahead, half-frozen {{difficult}} stream in front of them, cannon on flank, Pandour multitude in woods; all things betokening inexpugnability {{on the part of}} the Enemy. So that Lehwald has to take his measures; study well where the vital point is, the root of that extensive Austrian junglery, and cut in upon the same. By considerable fire of effort, the uphill ground, half-frozen stream, sylvan Pandours, cannon-batteries, and what inexpugnabilities there may be, are subdued; Austrian wide junglery, the root of it slit asunder rolls homeward simultaneously, not too fast: nay it halted, and re-ranked itself twice over, finding woods and quaggy runlets to its mind; but was always slit out again, <b>disrooted,</b> and finally tumbled home, having had enough. 'Wenzel Wallis,' Friedrich asserts with due scorn, 'was all this while in a Chapel; praying ardently,' to St. Vitus, or one knows not whom; 'without effect; till they shouted to him, [...] "Beaten, Sir! Off, or you are lost!" [...] upon which he sprang to saddle, and spurred with both heels (PIQUA DES DEUX).' [ OEuvres de Frederic, iii. 79. 80.] That was the feat of Lehwald, clearing the Glatz Country with one good cut: a skilful Captain; now getting decidedly oldish, close on sixty; whom we shall meet again a dozen years hence, still in harness.|$|R

'Well, my sister.' 'O,' she said, [...] 'What do you here? and in this dress? and these? [...] Why who are these? a wolf within the fold! [...] A pack of wolves! the Lord be gracious to me! [...] A plot, a plot, a plot to ruin all!' [...] 'No plot, no plot,' he answered. 'Wretched boy, [...] How saw you not the inscription on the gate, [...] LET NO MAN ENTER IN ON PAIN OF DEATH?' [...] 'And if I had,' he answered, 'who could think [...] The softer Adams of your Academe, [...] O sister, Sirens though they be, were such [...] As chanted on the blanching bones of men?' [...] 'But you will find it otherwise' she said. [...] 'You jest: ill jesting with edge-tools! my vow [...] Binds me to speak, and O that iron will, [...] That axelike edge unturnable, our Head, [...] The Princess.' 'Well then, Psyche, take my life, [...] And nail me like a weasel on a grange [...] For warning: bury me beside the gate, [...] And cut this epitaph above my bones; [...] Here lies a brother by a sister slain, [...] All {{for the common good}} of womankind.' [...] 'Let me die too,' said Cyril, 'having seen [...] And heard the Lady Psyche.' [...] I struck in: [...] 'Albeit so masked, Madam, I love the truth; [...] Receive it; and in me behold the Prince [...] Your countryman, affianced years ago [...] To the Lady Ida: here, for here she was, [...] And thus (what other way was left) I came.' [...] 'O Sir, O Prince, I have no country; none; [...] If any, this; but none. Whate'er I was [...] <b>Disrooted,</b> what I am is grafted here. [...] Affianced, Sir? love-whispers may not breathe [...] Within this vestal limit, and how should I, [...] Who am not mine, say, live: the thunderbolt [...] Hangs silent; but prepare: I speak; it falls.' [...] 'Yet pause,' I said: 'for that inscription there, [...] I think no more of deadly lurks therein, [...] Than in a clapper clapping in a garth, [...] To scare the fowl from fruit: if more there be, [...] If more and acted on, what follows? war; [...] Your own work marred: for this your Academe, [...] Whichever side be Victor, in the halloo [...] Will topple to the trumpet down, and pass [...] With all fair theories only made to gild [...] A stormless summer.' 'Let the Princess judge [...] Of that' she said: 'farewell, Sir--and to you. [...] I shudder at the sequel, but I go.' ...|$|R
