40|$|Many {{carbon based}} {{nanomaterials}} exhibit nonlinear optical response {{over a large}} wavelength range when irradiated with intense laser light what makes them promising candidates for optical limiting purposes. Besides nonlinear absorption some of these well studied nanostructures like carbon nanotubes or carbon black owe their prominent limiting efficiency particularly to induced nonlinear scattering. In this paper, our investigations on carbon nanohorns are presented—a new and very promising nonlinear optical material. It offers excellent properties like a low optical limiting threshold and a high nonlinear attenuation when tested with nanosecond laser pulses at wavelengths of 532 nm or 1064 nm. At moderate <b>irradiation</b> <b>levels</b> near the nonlinear threshold our measurements performed on colloidal carbon nanohorns reveal broadband nonlinear absorption as the dominant optical limiting effect.

40|$|Abstract. HANARO {{has been}} used for {{radioisotope}} production, material and <b>fuel</b> <b>irradiation</b> tests, beam application research and neutron activation analysis. In the initial stage of a normal operation, the usage time of the irradiation holes located in the core was less than 40 % of the reactor operation day. To raise the number of users and utilization areas of the irradiation holes, equipments and facilities have been developed such as various capsules. Starting with the capsule containing MoO 3 in 1999, the development of the capsule for an Ir- 192 production contributed to the utilization of the irradiation holes in the core. Another area for increasing the utilization of HANARO was the <b>fuel</b> <b>irradiation</b> tests to develop new fuels. Various fuel tests have been performed. The major fuel tests were U 3 Si fuel produced by an atomization process, a rod type U-Mo fuel for a new research reactor fuel, U-Zr fuel, a large grained UO 2 pellet developed for a high burn-up in KAERI. As a result of the steady efforts to improve HANARO’s utilization, the usage time of the irradiation holes is more than 90 % of the reactor operation day. 1...|$|R

40|$|Within the European High Temperature Reactor Technology Network (HTR-TN) {{and related}} {{projects}} {{a number of}} HTR <b>fuel</b> <b>irradiations</b> are planned in the High Flux Reactor Petten (HFR) with the objective to explore the potential of recently produced fuel for even higher temperature and burnup. For these irradiation tests a specific installation was designed and installed, dubbed the ¿Sweep Loop Facility (SLF) ¿. The SLF is tasked with three functions, namely temperature control, surveillance of safety parameters and analysis of fission gas release for three individual capsules in two separate experiments. This paper describes the gas activity measurement technique and shows how qualitative and quantitative analysis of volatile fission products can be performed on-line. The fractional release of these fission products, defined as the ratio between release rate of a gaseous fission isotope (measured) to its instantaneous birth rate (calculated), is a licensing-relevant experimental result of HTR <b>fuel</b> <b>irradiation</b> experiments, because it determines the operational (as opposed to accidental) source term for radioactivity release. The newly developed data acquisition system allows for higher measurement frequencies if activity values increase, thus enabling follow-up of transients.

40|$|The X 501 {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} EBR II {{as part of the}} Integral Fast Reactor program to demonstrate minor actinide burning {{through the use of a}} homogeneous recycle scheme. The X 501 subassembly contained two metallic fuel elements loaded with relatively small quantities of americium and neptunium. Interest in the behavior of minor actinides (MA) during <b>fuel</b> <b>irradiation</b> has prompted further examination of existing X 501 data and generation of new data where needed in support of the U.

The X 501 experiment is one of the few MA bearing <b>fuel</b> <b>irradiation</b> tests conducted worldwide, and knowledge can be gained by understanding the changes in fuel behavior due to addition of MAs. Of primary interest are the effect of the MAs on fuel cladding chemical interaction and the redistribution behavior of americium. The quantity of helium gas release from the fuel and any effects of helium on fuel performance are also of interest. It must be stressed that information presented at this time is based on the limited PIE conducted in 1995 – 1996 and, currently, represents a set of observations rather than a complete understanding of fuel behavior.

40|$|Temperature {{measurements}} in {{the nuclear}} field require {{a high degree of}} reliability and accuracy. Despite their sheathed form, thermocouples subjected to nuclear radiations undergo changes due to radiation damage and transmutation that lead to significant EMF drift during long-term <b>fuel</b> <b>irradiation</b> experiment. For the purpose of a High Temperature Reactor <b>fuel</b> <b>irradiation</b> to take place in the High Flux Reactor Petten, a dedicated fixed-point cell was jointly developed by LNE-Cnam and JRC-IET. The developed cell to be housed in the irradiation rig was tailor made to quantify the thermocouple drift during the irradiation (about two year duration) and withstand high temperature (in the range 950 °C- 1100 °C) in the presence of contaminated helium in a graphite environment. Considering the different levels of temperature achieved in the irradiation facility and the large palette of thermocouple types aimed at surveying the HTR fuel pebble during the qualification test both copper (1084. 62 °C) and gold (1064. 18 °C) fixed-point materials were considered. The aim {{of this paper is to}} first describe the fixed-point mini-cell designed to be embedded in the reactor rig and to discuss the preliminary results achieved during some out of pile tests as much as some robustness tests representative of the reactor scram scenarios.

40|$|Evolutionary {{aspects of}} high {{mutation}} pressure were studied in laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster that have irradiation histories up to 600 generations. Dose-response regressions for the x-ray induction {{of various types}} of mutation were obtained from six of these populations. The sensitivity of these irradiated populations relative to an unirradiated control population was characterized by dose reduction factors. Sensitivity decreased stepwise with the stepwise increase in <b>irradiation</b> <b>levels</b> to which the populations had been exposed every generation (0 R, 2 kR, 4 kR, 8 kR; 1 R = 0. 258 mC/kg) but remained the same over hundreds of generations when the <b>irradiation</b> <b>levels</b> were constant. Resistance is controlled by single genetic factors. Additional factors evolved in subpopulations exposed to increased <b>irradiation</b> <b>levels,</b> and different factors evolved in populations that were kept separate {{from the beginning of}} their irradiation histories. Two of three factors persisted in subpopulations no longer irradiated, but one factor disappeared; this last one behaved like a transposon.

The resistance factors enable populations to achieve an equilibrium between the amounts of environmental mutagens and intrinsic mutation rates...|$|R
40|$|Fracture {{properties}} of Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) steels show large variations {{with changes in}} temperature and <b>irradiation</b> <b>levels.</b> Brittle behavior is observed at lower temperatures and/or higher <b>irradiation</b> <b>levels</b> whereas ductile mode of failure is predominant at higher temperatures and/or lower <b>irradiation</b> <b>levels.</b> In addition to such temperature and radiation dependent fracture behavior, significant scatter in fracture toughness has also been observed. As a consequence of such variability in fracture behavior, accurate estimates of fracture {{properties of}} RPV steels are of utmost importance for {{safe and reliable operation}} of reactor pressure vessels. A cohesive zone based approach is being pursued in the present study where an attempt is made to obtain a unified law capturing both stable crack growth (ductile fracture) and unstable failure (cleavage fracture). The parameters of the constitutive model are dependent on both temperature and failure probability. The effect of irradiation has not been considered in the present study. The use of such a cohesive zone based approach would allow the modeling of explicit crack growth at both stable and unstable regimes of fracture. Also it would provide the possibility to incorporate more physical lower length scale models to predict DBT. Such a multi-scale approach would significantly improve the predictive capabilities of the model, which is still largely empirical...|$|R
