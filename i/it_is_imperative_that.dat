Being given the lower frequency of service on weekdays and Saturdays, except Thursdays (racing), we can perfectly accept the reduction to ten trips to those going from the racecourse to the forest, but, concerning the part of the journey from Trianon to the racecourse, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>that</b> the Chief Engineer (Lechelas) keeps the minimum to 30, otherwise there will be a kind of abandonment of the line, because for this small distance, it will not be possible to get reasonable traffic with more frequent departures.|$|E
5|$|Parents {{are assumed}} to have the child's best {{interests}} in mind. Ethically, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>that</b> the medical practitioner informs the parents about the benefits and risks of the procedure and obtain informed consent before performing it. Practically, however, many parents {{come to a decision}} about circumcising the child before he is born, and a discussion of the benefits and risks of the procedure with a physician has not been shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the decision. Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents' desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and harms) such non-medical factors in determining the child's best interests and may ethically perform the procedure. Equally, without a clear medical benefit relative to the potential harms, a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute enough as benefits to outweigh the potential harms and refuse to perform the procedure. Medical organization such as the British Medical Association state that their member physicians are not obliged to perform the procedure in such situations.|$|E

25|$|All lens {{constants}} are estimates, {{to begin}} with. To obtain {{the best possible}} results, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>that</b> these constants be optimized. Optimization {{is a process that}} is user-specific and incorporates the various systematic errors attributable to measurement of ocular parameters. In order to optimize a lens-constant, the user must back calculate the formula so that the actual post-operative refractive error is included. This means that one must calculate the constant so that a recalculation of the formula would predict exactly the same refractive error as actually observed.|$|E
25|$|The {{captain of}} the Ollie K Wilds stated that the windows of his pilot house were closed, {{and that he did}} not hear the Frosta's horn. A {{previous}} accident involving the George Prince followed a similar scenario. On that occasion, the {{captain of the}} ferry stated that he did not hear the sounding of vehicle horns or the shouts of passengers. The morning of the accident, the windows were likely closed, and this may have prevented Auletta from hearing the Frosta's horn. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>that</b> a lookout be designated and posted outside to listen for and relay signals from other vessels.|$|E

25|$|Patients {{deficient}} in B12 despite normal absorption functionality may be treated through oral administration {{of at least}} 6mg of the vitamin in pill form. Patients who suffer from irreversible causes of deficiency, such as pernicious anemia or old age, will need lifelong treatment with pharmacological doses of B12. Strategy for treatment {{is dependent on the}} patient's level of deficiency as well as their level of cognitive functioning. Treatment for those with severe deficiency involves 1000mg of B12 administered intramuscularly daily for one week, weekly for one month, then monthly {{for the rest of the}} patients life. Daily oral supplementation of B12 mega-doses may be sufficient in reliable patients, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>that</b> the supplementation be continued on a lifelong basis as relapse may occur otherwise.|$|E

500|$|After {{the failure}} of the all-conservative government, the Grand Duchess turned to the leading liberal politician, Victor Thorn, to form a new government. [...] After Eyschen's premiership of 27 years, two governments had come and gone in three months, and the Luxembourgish people were {{becoming}} disillusioned with {{the failure of}} the politicians. [...] Thorn's nature was to be a conciliatory leader, and he made a direct appeal to the Chamber of Deputies to support his government, no matter the deputies' individual ideological persuasions: [...] "If you want a government that acts, and is capable of acting, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>that</b> all parties support this government." [...] This support was forthcoming from all parties, but only on the condition that each was invited into the government; Thorn was left with no choice but to afford them this. [...] The resulting grand coalition cabinet included every leading light in Luxembourgish politics; besides Thorn himself, there were the conservatives Léon Kauffmann and Antoine Lefort, the socialist leader Dr Michel Welter, and the liberal Léon Moutrier.|$|E
500|$|White Dog's roots {{lie with}} a 1970 autobiographical novel written by Romain Gary {{of the same}} name. The story was {{purchased}} for use by Paramount in 1975, with Curtis Hanson selected to write the screenplay and Roman Polanski hired to direct. Before shooting commenced, Polanski was charged with statutory rape and fled the country, leaving the production in limbo. Over a span of six years, the project was given to various writers and producers, who all focused on the stray dog story from Gary's original work. Gary's activist wife was replaced in the script with a young, unmarried actress because Paramount wanted to contrast the dog's random attacks with a loving relationship between the protagonist and the dog. Paramount executives noted that they wanted a [...] "Jaws with paws" [...] and indicated that they wanted any racial elements to be downplayed. In one memo, the company noted: [...] "Given the organic elements of this story, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>that</b> we never overtly address through attitude or statement the issue of racism per se." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lung {{transplantation}} or pulmonary transplantation is {{a surgical}} procedure {{in which a}} patient's diseased lungs are partially or totally replaced by lungs which come from a donor. Donor lungs can be retrieved from a living donor or a deceased donor. A living donor can only donate one lung lobe. With some lung diseases a recipient may only need to receive a single lung. [...] With other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>that</b> a recipient receive two lungs. While lung transplants carry certain associated risks, they can also extend life expectancy and {{enhance the quality of}} life for end-stage pulmonary patients.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Bennet of the Longbourn estate {{has five}} daughters, but his {{property}} is entailed, meaning {{that none of}} the girls can inherit it. His wife has no fortune, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>that</b> {{at least one of the}} girls marry well in order to support the others on his death. Jane Austen's opening line, “It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife" [...] is a sentence filled with irony and playfulness. The novel revolves around the necessity of marrying for love, not simply for monetary reasons, despite the social pressures to make a good [...] match.|$|E

2500|$|Due to the Komondor's size, power, {{speed and}} temperament, {{a lack of}} {{obedience}} training can result in danger to others. [...] Komondors generally take well to training if started early (ideally between 4–8 months). A Komondor can become obstinate when bored, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>that</b> training sessions be upbeat and happy. Praise is a must, as are consistent and humane corrections. Once a Komondor gets away with unfriendly or hostile behavior, it will always think such behavior is appropriate. Therefore, consistent corrections even with a young puppy are necessary to ensure a well-adjusted adult. Socialization is also extremely important. The Komondor should be exposed to new situations, people and other dogs as a puppy. Because it is a natural guard dog, a Komondor that is not properly socialized may react in an excessively aggressive manner when confronted with a new situation or person.|$|E
2500|$|Owing to the {{delicate}} {{nature of the}} materials, and the incalculable historic and aesthetic value of stained glass work, any and all treatments should be planned and performed by professional conservators and craftspeople, who have been specially trained in the peculiarities of the medium.

[...] For this reason, all projects should begin with a conservation plan that incorporates research in such topics as {{the history of the}} windows or building, the materials involved, and past alterations, as a key element of all conservation decisions. [...] The type of conservation treatment employed should reflect this research, as well as the needs of the building as a whole, and should always be documented for reference in the future (CVMA 2004).|$|E
2500|$|Removal {{of debris}} (wax, shed skin, and pus) from {{the ear canal}} {{promotes}} direct contact of the prescribed medication with the infected skin and shortens recovery time. When canal swelling has progressed {{to the point where}} the ear canal is blocked, topical drops may not penetrate far enough into the ear canal to be effective. [...] The physician may need to carefully insert a wick of cotton or other commercially available, pre-fashioned, absorbent material called an ear wick and then saturate that with the medication. [...] The wick is kept saturated with medication until the canal opens enough that the drops will penetrate the canal without it. [...] Removal of the wick does not require a health professional. Antibiotic ear drops should be dosed in a quantity that allows coating of most of the ear canal and used for no more than 4 to 7 days. [...] The ear should be left open.
