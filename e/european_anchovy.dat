40|$|The use of {{comprehensive}} gas chromatography (GCxGC) {{is a very}} useful approach {{in order to obtain}} a high resolution separation of complex samples. With comprehensive GCxGC (unlike "heart-cut" 2 D GC) the whole sample injected into the system is subjected to two different stationary phases, resulting in a more effective separation than that obtained with conventional one-dimensional (1 -D) GC. GCxGC is usually coupled on-line with mass spectrometry, since the resulting bidimensional chromatographic trace needs unambiguous peak identification. The main object of this study was the application of GCxGC/MS to the analysis of both saponifiable and unsaponifiable lipid fractions of different edible matrices. The fatty acids of pomegranate seed oil (Punica granatum), <b>European</b> <b>anchovy's</b> brain (Sardina pilchardus), Berberè (a mix of spices) and the not-saponifiable fraction of Coffea var. robusta were characterized by comprehensive multidimensional gas chromatography with a non-polar (5 % phenyl polysiloxane) /medium polar (50 % phenyl poly-siloxane) column set equipped with a quadrupole mass-spectrometer...|$|R
40|$|The {{sustained}} {{exploitation of}} marine populations {{requires an understanding}} of a species' adaptive seascape so that populations can track environmental changes from short- and long-term climate cycles and from human development. The analysis of the distributions of genetic markers among populations, together with correlates of life-history and environmental variability, can provide insights into the extent of adaptive variation. Here, we examined genetic variability among populations of mature <b>European</b> <b>anchovies</b> (n = 531) in the Adriatic (13 samples) and Tyrrhenian seas (2 samples) with neutral and putative non-neutral microsatellite loci. These genetic markers failed to confirm the occurrence of two anchovy species in the Adriatic Sea, as previously postulated. However, we found fine-scale population structure in the Adriatic, especially in northern areas, that was associated with four of the 13 environmental variables tested. Geographic gradients in sea temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen appear to drive adaptive differences in spawning time and early larval development among populations. Resolving adaptive seascapes in Adriatic anchovies provides a means to understand mechanisms underpinning local adaptation and a basis for optimizing exploitation strategies for sustainable harvests...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAnisakid {{nematodes}} {{belonging to}} the species Anisakis pegreffii are distributed {{in a wide variety}} of fishes from the Mediterranean Sea and they are known to cause the human zoonosis anisakiasis. The present study investigated, for the first time, the response of A.  pegreffii larvae (identified to species level by allozymes and mtDNA cox 2 sequence analysis) to the storage temperature of <b>European</b> <b>anchovies,</b> Engraulis encrasicolus. The larval motility of A.  pegreffii was studied in 1300 fish specimens, captured from a highly infested area (FAO 37. 2. 1, 43 ° 8 ′N, 14 ° 16 ′E), maintained under different temperatures (2  °C, 5  °C, 7  °C), and examined at different time intervals (immediately after fishing, 24  h, 48  h and 72  h). Parasitological analysis was carried out with the UV-press method. The results showed that the increase of infection values with A.  pegreffii in the fillets of anchovies was statistically positively related to the increase of the temperature (at 5  °C and 7  °C) and time of storage (after 24  h, 48  h, and 72  h). Accordingly, a significant statistical correlation between the increasing of the worm burden in the fillets and a decreasing of A.  pegreffii in the viscera was observed. In contrast, those fish constantly maintained at 2  °C showed no statistically significant variation in infection either in the viscera or the fillets, after 24, 48 and 72  h. In the same batches of anchovies, larvae of the non-zoonotic nematode parasite Hysterothylacium aduncum (identified to the species level by ITS rDNA sequences analysis) were found, but they were never observed infecting the musculature of the anchovies. Our results suggest that temperature plays an important role in the post-mortem motility of A.  pegreffii larvae in anchovies. In addition, the presence of A.  pegreffii in the fillets inspected immediately after their capture indicates that intra-vitam migration may also occur. As a consequence, the importance of the adoption of rules to prevent human anisakiasis, as the deep freezing to − 20  °C for 24  h, was underlined...|$|R

However, spatio-temporal irregularities in the dynamics of the Sub-Area VIII stock as well as scant knowledge on the IXa anchovy biology lead ICES to recommend more studies on population dynamics and possible relationships between areas. The present work describes morphometric differences between the two stocks based on the analysis of 10 samples collected within the area from Bay of Biscay to the Bay of Cadiz during two consecutive years (2000 and 2001). Distances on a “Truss Network” were computed from 2 D landmark coordinates obtained from digitized images of each individual and corrected from the effect of fish size. Principal Component Analysis was applied to the shape data, as well as a Multidimensional Scaling to the squared Mahalonobis distances (D 2) between every pair of sample centroids to visualise clustering. The significance of the computed D 2 distances was also statistically tested. Finally, Artificial Neural Networks were applied to assess the robustness of sample groups highlighted in the previous analyses. Results indicate a separation between samples from the Bay of Biscay and those from Division IXa, which is stable over time, as well as a north-south cline along the Portuguese and Bay of Cadiz area. This variability is mainly caused by differences on the shape of the medium-posterior region of the body...|$|R
