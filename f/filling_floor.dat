40|$|In {{the present}} study both {{experimental}} measurements and calculation models {{have been used to}} investigate the practical performance of reflective foils in air <b>filled</b> <b>floor</b> cavities. The laboratory measurements were performed in a pivotal guarded hot-box. Both heat flow down through the floor area and the temperature distribution in the cavities were measured. The number of reflective foils and the amount of edge insulation at the edge beams has been varied as well as the environmental temperature conditions. Measured and calculated results show good agreement for most of the tested timber floor variants...|$|R
2500|$|The {{intermediate}} plains {{material and}} smooth plains material probably also consist of mixtures of relatively fine crater ejecta and volcanic materials {{that appear to}} form a continuous sequence. Both units are thicker than the intercrater plains unit. The intermediate plains material is widespread in intercrater areas in the west half of the quadrangle and <b>fills</b> <b>floors</b> of older craters and basins in the southern part. Smooth plains material, the youngest plains unit, occurs as scattered patches in low areas and covers the floors of many craters of c4 age and older. In some crater floors, especially smaller ones, differentiation between smooth plains and intermediate plains materials is difficult and the choice becomes arbitrary.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Members of an alunite-natroalunite solid {{solution}} series occur in intimate association with hydrated halloysite in deposits within caves of the Guadalupe Mountains, namely Carlsbad Cavern and Lechuguilla Cave. The alunite and natroalunite crystals consist of cube-like rhombs; crystal diameters range from 0. 5 to 8 p~m. This mineral association {{is found in}} sediments within bedrock pockets, solution cavity <b>fills,</b> <b>floor</b> deposits and wall residues. Sulfur stable isotope values (~ 345, CTD) for cave alunite and natroalunite are negative [+ 0. 1 to- 28. 9 per mill (%o); n = 12 and mean = 16. 8 %~] and are comparable to the cave gypsum and native sulfur values reported by other investigators. The association of alunite/ natroalunite with hydrated halloysite in these cave deposits uggests that the cave-forming waters con-tained significant concentrations of sulfuric acid. Formation of these minerals {{is related to the}} excavation of the carbonate rocks that formed Carlsbad Cavern, Lechuguilla Cave and other caves of the Guadalupe Mountains. The sulfuric acid-bearing waters, when exposed to clay-rich sediments, converted clay min-erals and quartz to alunite/natroalunite and hydrated halloysite...|$|R

It forms planar to gently undulating surfaces and both embays tracts of cratered terrain and <b>fills</b> crater <b>floors.</b> Both upper and lower contacts with other plains units are gradational. These gradations suggest that the assignment of age to plains deposits on Mercury is partly dependent on the relative abundance of superposed secondary craters, whose densities vary widely {{as a function of}} nearby source craters.|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} ways to test whether an {{architectural}} space is functional, comfortable, physically sustainable and even at times fashionable. However, except function and style, architectural spaces sometimes seek to fulfill humans’ specific spiritual needs. Physical records and precedent data are not efficient for designers to reach occupancies’ phenomenological notion of the space. This project aimed to map occupancies’ phenomenological movement tracks within orthogonal space and curved space. A pavilion with orthogonal and curved surfaces was set up with in College of Design for one week. Visitors were invited to draw their movement track on scaled floor plan of the pavilion when they finished their exploration of the space. Instead of mapping their actual movement within the pavilion, this project recorded movement happened in occupancies’ mind. I scanned these <b>filled</b> <b>floor</b> plans and overlaid them in one diagram. I generated the conclusion through analysis of this diagram and observation of occupancies’ movement. Compared to an orthogonal space, a curved space may not lead to richer interactions in physical sense. However, a curved space can help occupancies link the external space and their movement. By doing this, architectural spaces help them frame there memory, preserving every moment with in the space...|$|R
50|$|Millousi {{began the}} 2015 season by once again {{competing}} at the Cottbus World Cup. She {{did not make}} the beam final after only scoring a 12.466 in qualifications after an error. At the European Championships in Montpellier, Millousi made an error on the uneven bars and did not qualify to the final. On beam, Millousi hit a decent routine with a 0.1 penalty for a 14.166, qualifying her to the beam final in 8th place. In the final, she was in position for her first European Championships medal right until the end of her routine, where she fell on her double pike dismount, scoring a 13.266 and finishing in 5th place. After her disappointing European Championships, Millousi competed at the Baku European Games where she qualified to the all-around final. After making errors on bars, beam and floor Millousi ended up with only a 49.599 all-around score. Next Millousi competed at the Hungarian Grand Prix, winning the gold medal on beam and the bronze medal on floor. Millousi ended her season with a disappointing performance at the World Championships in Glasgow performing on three events. She hit bars for a 13.066, a wobbly beam set with a low-landed double pike for a 13.766 and an error <b>filled</b> <b>floor</b> routine for an 11.633.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the iconic and established business model that has {{evolved in the}} fashion industry, which embraces the constructs of fast fashion, high frequency drops into retail stores and the associated relationships with seasonal appropriateness and design analysis. These issues provide for the timely consideration of alternate business systems that will support positive and sustainable practices within the fashion industry. Over {{the past fifty years}} there has been a radical shift in the system of fashion; fast disposable fashion is now the norm rather than the exception. Fashion has moved from an historical formulaic process of two significant collections a year of spring/summer and autumn/winter, to multi layered delivery drops on a fast track turn around. The year is punctuated by the constant flow of new product that quickly <b>fills</b> <b>floor</b> space in anticipation of quick turn around sales. Major retail outlets now have over-arching markdown strategies embedded into their buying systems and fashion obsolescence is a reality of the industry. The contemporary business model for most of the millions employed within the modern day fashion sector is an exceptionally fast paced industry, where a team scans the world for styling ideas, adapted from those that already exist so as to reinterpret as their own. Ideas from all tiers of the fashion world are reinvented and regurgitated into variations on a theme...|$|R
50|$|After the Second World War, music changed. Jazz clubs, {{burdened}} by new taxes and legislation limiting venues' ability to employ musicians and dancers or host dancing, employed only smaller bands and <b>filled</b> dance <b>floors</b> with tables. Musicians, {{immersed in the}} new world of bebop and cool jazz wanted patrons to pay attention and listen, not dance. The rise of rock and roll and bebop in the 1950s saw a further decline in the popularity of jazz for dancing, and Lindy Hop slipped from the public eye, replaced by Rock and Roll dancing, East Coast Swing, West Coast Swing and other dances.|$|R

40|$|Raised {{access floor}} panels {{currently}} have a chipboard core and are encapsulated within {{thin layer of}} galvanised steel. Two key problems with these raised access floor panels are that they are heavy because of the chipboard and expensive, {{as the cost of}} steel has increased significantly over the past few years. The consequence of the raised access floor panel’s mass is that they are difficult to handle, they are expensive to transport and they add considerably to the load on a structures foundation. Glass fibre <b>filled</b> epoxy of <b>floor</b> panels were designed and optimised to achieve lighter weights without compromising their strength using Altair Hypermesh software. A material weight reduction of the glass fibre <b>filled</b> epoxy <b>floor</b> panel was achieved by optimised design of the panes using an evolutionary structural optimisation (ESO) method and the introduction of panel ribs. The lighter weight of new raised floors panel would {{have a significant impact on}} the loadings of buildings foundation and allow architects to reduce the carbon footprint of a building resulting in reduced construction costs. In addition, a reduction in the weight of the new raised access floor panels would reduce the transportation costs of the panels...|$|R
