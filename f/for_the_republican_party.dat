5|$|A growing {{population}} and political concerns (admitting two states meant having four new senators <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party)</b> caused Dakota Territory {{to be divided}} in half and President Benjamin Harrison signed proclamations formally admitting South Dakota and North Dakota to the union on November 2, 1889. Harrison had the papers shuffled to obscure which one was signed first and the order went unrecorded.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, William McKinley {{was elected}} President of the United States. McKinley, a Republican and former Governor of Ohio, {{defeated}} the joint Democratic and Populist nominee, William Jennings Bryan, {{as well as}} minor-party candidates.

5|$|Lame duck {{incumbent}} president Bill Clinton was a Democrat, {{and the field}} for nomination for President of both parties was wide open. Bush was governor of Texas in June 1999 when he announced his candidacy for President of the United States.

5|$|Louie Broady Nunn {{was born}} in Park, Kentucky– a small {{community}} {{on the border of}} Barren and Metcalfe counties– on March 8, 1924. His given name, Louie, honored a deceased friend of his father's; his middle name, Broady, was a surname in his mother's family. Louie was the youngest of the four sons born to Waller Harrison and Mary (Roberts) Nunn; their youngest child, Virginia, was their only daughter. The Nunns were farmers and operated a general store, though Waller suffered from a congenital heart condition and severe arthritis and was limited to light chores. The eldest brother, Lee Roy, became an influential campaigner and fundraiser <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{election}} in Delta County occurred on October 6, 1870, to establish {{control in the}} newly formed county. Cooper held its first {{election in}} 1881, establishing an aldermanic government. Around that time, the first county courthouse was built in Cooper. Delta County, in addition to Cooper, voted for the Democratic Party in every presidential election from its incorporation in 1870 until 1968. However, the Populist Party won numerous local and county government positions during the 1890s and the early 1900s. In the 1970s, politics in Delta County shifted, {{and most of the}} county began voting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 1968 Democratic Convention, {{a motion}} {{had been passed}} to {{establish}} a commission to reform the Democratic Party nomination process. In 1969, McGovern was named chair of the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, {{also known as the}} McGovern–Fraser Commission; due to the influence of former McCarthy and Kennedy supporters on the staff, the commission significantly reduced the role of party officials and insiders in the nomination process, increased the role of caucuses and primaries, and mandated quotas for proportional black, female, and youth delegate representation. A somewhat unintended consequence of the commission's reforms was a massive {{increase in the number of}} presidential primaries; this became true <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> as well. The U.S.presidential nominating process has been different ever since, with scholars and politicians debating whether all the changes are for the better.|$|E

5|$|Ford reluctantly {{agreed to}} run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a {{challenge}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>party</b> nomination. Former Governor of California Ronald Reagan and the party's conservative wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in South Vietnam, for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the Panama Canal. (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries, including North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, and California, but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the Republican Convention in Kansas City, Missouri. The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more liberal Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.|$|E
5|$|The California Gold Rush (1848–1855) {{began on}} January 24, 1848, when gold {{was found by}} James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California. The news of gold brought some 300,000 people to California {{from the rest of}} the United States and abroad. The sudden influx of {{immigration}} and gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy, and California became one of the few American states to go directly to statehood without first being a territory, in the Compromise of 1850. The Gold Rush had severe effects on Native Californians and resulted in a precipitous population decline from disease, genocide and starvation. By the time it ended, California had gone from a thinly populated ex-Mexican territory to the home state of the first nominee <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
5|$|While still teaching, Hatfield {{served in}} both houses of the Oregon Legislative Assembly. He won {{election}} to the Oregon Secretary of State's office at the age of 34 and two years later was elected as the 29th Governor of Oregon. He was the youngest person to ever serve in either of those offices, and served two terms as governor before election to the United States Senate. In the Senate he served for 30years, and now holds the record for longest tenure of any Senator from Oregon. At the time of his retirement, he was 7th most senior Senator as well as second most senior Republican. In 1968, he was considered a candidate to be Richard Nixon's running mate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> presidential ticket.|$|E
5000|$|In presidential elections, Warren County voted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party's</b> {{candidate}} in every election from 1936 through 1988, often {{by a wide}} margin.

50|$|Two {{individuals}} ran <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>party's</b> nomination, {{money manager}} Ken Simpler and Sher Valenzuela, former Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor in 2012. <b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> primary campaign was a bitter one, marked by infighting and with outside spending behind both candidates, who criticised each other frequently.|$|R
5|$|New {{polls in}} January {{indicated}} voter support was growing for Toomey, who now held a projected nine percentage point lead over Specter and an eight-point lead over Sestak. Specter continued to lead against Sestak in the Democratic primary poll, {{this time by}} a 21-point margin. Some political scientists believed Toomey's gain over Specter {{could be attributed to}} voter distrust of establishment candidates and growing dissatisfaction with the health care proposal pending in Congress. However, some Democratic leaders felt Sestak's challenge to Specter was having a detrimental effect not only to Specter, but to the Democratic party in general and their prospects for ultimately winning the general election. This feeling was enhanced by the growing national support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>party,</b> and especially by the unexpected victory of the Tea Party-backed Republican Scott Brown in a special election for a traditionally Democratic Massachusetts Senate seat. Specter acknowledged to The New York Times that the national political mood might work against him in the primary, but insisted he was not discouraged and expressed confidence in his ability to survive.|$|E
