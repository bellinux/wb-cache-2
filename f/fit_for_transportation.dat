We collected information from all side of the project – history of the transportation network, social environment, technical choices – reading documentation and interviewing stakeholders. Major problems emerging during the executing phases turn out to be managerial and referable to project management areas. So we addressed to the modern theory of project management based on complexity, which seemed to be <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> urban <b>transportation</b> projects...|$|R
60|$|In {{considering}} the wide distribution of certain genera, we should {{bear in mind}} that some are extremely ancient, and must have branched off from a common parent at a remote epoch; so that in such cases there will have been ample time for great climatal and geographical changes and for accidents of transport; and consequently for the migration of some of the species into all quarters of the world, where they may have become slightly modified in relation to their new conditions. There is, also, some reason to believe from geological evidence that organisms low in the scale within each great class, generally change at a slower rate than the higher forms; and consequently the lower forms will have had a better chance of ranging widely and of still retaining the same specific character. This fact, together with the seeds and eggs of many low forms being very minute and better <b>fitted</b> <b>for</b> distant <b>transportation,</b> probably accounts <b>for</b> a law which has long been observed, and which has lately been admirably discussed by Alph. de Candolle in regard to plants, namely, that the lower any group of organisms is, the more widely it is apt to range.|$|R
40|$|Copenhagen has a {{well-developed}} {{public transportation}} system, mixed with private {{means of transportation}} such as cars and bicycles. As we pursue a sustainable eco-friendly transport system it becomes clear, that car transportation has too high an environmental impact and takes up too much road space. Copenhagen, being an old city, is very compact and not very <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> car <b>transportation.</b> As we investigate the possibilities for a sustainable eco-friendly transport system, {{it becomes clear that}} {{we need to get the}} cars out of Copenhagen. This will have to be done in collaboration with the development of a sustainable public transportation system. The new Metro Cityring will provide a solid base for implementing car-free zones within central Copenhagen. This has to be done alongside the expansion of the electric-powered bus system, already existing and operating at a smaller scale in the city center. Furthermore, we will implement congestion fees for cars entering Copenhagen. In order to change the current system, we use the theories of sociotechnical regimes, and transition management. In order to aim our goals at a ‘real’ sustainable solution we use Industrial Ecology, not only to define our sustainable goals, but also to analyze the current system from a sustainable point of view...|$|R

Selection will be realized by using TOPSIS method. Theoretical part focuses on issues of business in road transport, trucks and combinations in road transport and limits of their dimensions and weights. It also describes some methods of multi-criteria decision making. Practical part focuses directly on selection of suitable semitrailer combination <b>for</b> <b>transportation</b> of long timbers and also selection of truck <b>for</b> <b>transportation</b> of ACTS containers according to the defined criteria. One of the aims is also mapping of the market and choices which exist when selecting combination <b>for</b> <b>transportation</b> of long timbers...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Assessing {{the contextual}} factors that {{influence}} walking <b>for</b> <b>transportation</b> is important to develop more walkable environments and promote physical activity. To advance previous research focused on residential environments and overall walking <b>for</b> <b>transportation,</b> {{the present study investigates}} objective environmental factors assessed around the residence, the workplace, the home [...] work itinerary, and the home [...] supermarket itinerary, and considered overall walking <b>for</b> <b>transportation</b> but also walking to work and to shops. METHODS: Data from the RECORD Study involving 7290 participants recruited in 2007 - 2008, aged 30 - 79 years, and residing in the Paris metropolitan area were analyzed. Multilevel ordinal regression analyses were conducted to investigate environmental characteristics associated with self-reported overall walking <b>for</b> <b>transportation,</b> walking to work, and walking to shops. RESULTS: High individual education was associated with overall walking <b>for</b> <b>transportation,</b> with walking to work, and walking to shops. Among workers, a high residential neighborhood education was associated with increased overall walking <b>for</b> <b>transportation,</b> while a high workplace neighborhood education was related to an increased time spent walking to work. The residential density of destinations was positively associated with overall walking <b>for</b> <b>transportation,</b> with walking to work, and with walking to shops, while the workplace density of destinations was positively associated with overall walking <b>for</b> <b>transportation</b> among workers. Environmental factors assessed around the itineraries were not associated with walking to work or to the shops. CONCLUSION: This research improves our understanding {{of the role of the}} environments on walking <b>for</b> <b>transportation</b> by accounting <b>for</b> some of the environments visited beyond the residential neighborhood. It shows that workers' walking habits are more influenced by the density of destinations around the workplace than around the residence. These results provide insight for the development of policies and programs to encourage population level active commuting...|$|R

An expedition was immediately set on foot, not only to surprise this place, but to scour the country, and bring off all horses <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> the dragoons, or for battalion service, with as many saddles and bridles as could be found.|$|R
