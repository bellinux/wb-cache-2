However, the ways these two variables adjust {{to each other in}} the short run and generate co-movement have changed across these sample periods. In the pre- 1979 sample period, when a positive gap opens up with <b>headline</b> inflation rising above core inflation, the gap is eliminated mainly as a result of <b>headline</b> inflation not reverting and core inflation moving toward <b>headline</b> inflation. These dynamics suggest <b>headline</b> inflation would be better than core inflation in assessing the permanent component of inflation. In post- 1979 sample periods, however, the positive gap is eliminated as a result of <b>headline</b> inflation reverting more strongly toward core inflation than core inflation moving toward <b>headline</b> inflation, suggesting core inflation would be better than <b>headline</b> inflation in assessing the permanent component of inflation. This change in headline-core inflation dynamics may be due to the Federal Reserve having convinced the public it would no longer accommodate shocks to food and energy prices.
