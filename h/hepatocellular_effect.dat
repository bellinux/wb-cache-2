40|$|Epidemiological and {{biological}} data on HRT {{and breast cancer}} risk are reviewed. Some aspects deserve consideration. (1) The majority of epidemiological data have been gathered from populations where high estrogen doses (] 1. 25 mg daily of conjugated estrogens) were used as first line therapy. (2) HRT does not increase the risk in overweight women, even in the series in which a risk increase (in longterm users) is found. This could be {{as a result of}} the fact that oral estrogens, through their metabolic and <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>effects,</b> reverse some biological features of obesity (e. g. increased insulin-like growth factor I activity and decreased sex hormone binding globulin level) which potentially increase breast cancer risk, so balancing the estrogen stimulation. (3) The progestin addition seems to increase the risk when the 19 nor-testosterone derivatives are used. These androgenic compounds contrast the metabolic and <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>effects</b> of oral estrogens. To sum up, the possibility does exist that even the longterm use of oral estrogens at the right (‘low’) dose, with the addition of a non-androgenic progestin, will be shown to be associated with a very limited breast cancer risk increase. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Controlled {{studies and}} most {{observational}} studies published {{over the last}} 5 years suggest that the addition of synthetic progestins to estrogen in hormone replacement therapy (HRT), particularly in continuous-combined regimen, increases the breast cancer (BC) risk compared to estrogen alone. By contrast, a recent study suggests that the addition of natural progesterone in cyclic regimens does not affect BC risk. This {{finding is consistent with}} in vivo data suggesting that progesterone does not have a detrimental effect on breast tissue. The increased BC risk found with the addition of synthetic progestins to estrogen could be due to the regimen and/or the kind of progestin used. Continuous-combined regimen inhibits the sloughing of mammary epithelium that occurs after progesterone withdrawal in a cyclic regimen. More importantly, the progestins used (medroxyprogesterone acetate and 19 -Nortestosterone-derivatives) are endowed with some non-progesterone-like effects, which can potentiate the proliferative action of estrogens. Particularly relevant seem to be the metabolic and <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>effects</b> (decreased insulin sensitivity, increased levels and activity of insulin-like growth factor-I, and decreased levels of SHBG), which contrast the opposite effects induced by oral estrogen...|$|R
40|$|Available {{epidemiologic}} {{data suggest}} {{the possibility that}} the use of oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) 0. 625 mg/day as a first-choice dose could be associated with a very limited (if any) breast cancer risk increase. Some biological peculiarities of oral CEE back the possi-bility of a limited detrimental effect on breast tissue, due to either direct or indirect actions. Direct actions. Some experimental findings suggest that the 17 a-dihydroderivatives of equilenin and equilin (15 % of the CEE components) have a non-estrogenic or even an anti-estrogenic effect on breast tissue. This could partially counterbalance the stimulatory action of the other CEE components. Indirect actions. Oral estrogens, through their meta-bolic and <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>effects</b> (emphasized by the first liver passage) cause a sharp increase in sex hormone bind-ing globulin (SHBG) level which is followed by a lower quantity of both estrogen and androgen in the free, bioavailable, form. More importantly, they cause a decrease in circulating insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) activity, due to both a reduction in IGF-I synthesis by the liver and an increase in IGF-binding protein- 1 level. A strong relationship between breast cancer risk and the con-centration of circulating IGF-I in premenopausal women has been recently found. Actually, estrogens and IGF-I have a synergistic effect on cell proliferation, and IGF-I is necessary for maximum estrogen-receptor activation in breast cancer cell lines. The possibility does exist that the SHBG level increase and the IGF-I bioavailability decrease, caused by oral CEE, balance the increased estrogen stimulation on breast tissue...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that PPAR&# 945; agonists stimulate Kupffer cells in rodents which in turn, release mitogenic factors leading to hepatic hyperplasia, and eventually cancer. However, Kupffer cells do not express PPAR&# 945; receptors, and PPAR&# 945; agonists stimulate hepatocellular proliferation in both TNF&# 945;- and TNF&# 945; receptor-null mice, casting doubt on the involvement of Kupffer cells in the mitogenic response to PPAR&# 945; agonists. This study was therefore designed to investigate whether the PPAR&# 945; agonist PFOA and the Kupffer cell inhibitor methylpalmitate produce opposing <b>effects</b> on <b>hepatocellular</b> proliferation and Kupffer cell activity in vivo, {{in a manner that}} would implicate these cells in the mitogenic effects of PPAR&# 945; agonists. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated intravenously via the tail vein with methylpalmitate 24 hrs prior to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and were sacrificed 24 hrs later, one hr after an intraperitoneal injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Sera were analyzed for TNF&# 945; and IL- 1 &# 946;. Liver sections were stained immunohistochemically and quantified for BrdU incorporated into DNA. Results Data show that PFOA remarkably stimulated hepatocellular proliferation in the absence of significant changes in the serum levels of either TNF&# 945; or IL- 1 &# 946;. In addition, methylpalmitate did not alter the levels of these mitogens in PFOA-treated animals, {{despite the fact that it}} significantly blocked the <b>hepatocellular</b> proliferative <b>effect</b> of PFOA. Correlation between hepatocellular proliferation and serum levels of TNF&# 945; or IL- 1 &# 946; was extremely poor. Conclusion It is unlikely that mechanisms involving Kupffer cells play an eminent role in the hepatic hyperplasia, and consequently hepatocarcinogenicity attributed to PPAR&# 945; agonists. This conclusion is based on the above mentioned published data and the current findings showing animals treated with PFOA alone or in combination with methylpalmitate to have similar levels of serum TNF&# 945; and IL- 1 &# 946;, which are reliable indicators of Kupffer cell activity, despite a remarkable difference in hepatocellular proliferation. </p...|$|R

After a 70 % partial hepatectomy, the rats were euthanized on post-operative days (POD) 2, 4 or 8. Hepatocyte proliferation was estimated by immunohistochemistry for Ki- 67 antigen using stereological methods on sections prepared by systematic uniform random sampling. ResultsSeven animals (12 %) died after surgery. Death rates were similar in treated rats and controls. At hepatectomy, the body weight was significantly lower in group S rats. The liver weight and regeneration rates were lower in group S rats on PODs 2, 4 and 8. Hepatocyte proliferation was significantly lower in group S animals on PODs 2 and 4.

However, it remains unclear whether SIRT 1 functions as an oncogene or tumor suppressor. We sought to elucidate the role of SIRT 1 in liver cancer {{under the influence of}} c-Myc and to determine the prognostic significance of SIRT 1 and c-Myc expression in human <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma. The <b>effect</b> of either over-expression or knock down of SIRT 1 on cell proliferation and survival was evaluated in both mouse and human liver cancer cells. Nicotinamide, an inhibitor of SIRT 1, was also evaluated for its effects on liver tumorigenesis. The prognostic significance of the immunohistochemical detection of SIRT 1 and c-Myc was evaluated in 154 hepatocellular carcinoma patients. SIRT 1 and c-Myc regulate each other via a positive feedback loop and act synergistically to promote hepatocellular proliferation in both mice and human liver tumor cells. Tumor growth was significantly inhibited by nicotinamide in vivo and in vitro. In human hepatocellular carcinoma, SIRT 1 expression positively correlated with c-Myc, Ki 67 and p 53 expression, as well as high á-fetoprotein level. Moreover, the expression of SIRT 1, c-Myc and p 53 were independent prognostic indicators of hepatocellular carcinoma.

40|$|AbstractBACKGROUND & AIM: Aflibercept {{known as}} ziv-aflibercept in the United States is a soluble decoy {{receptor}} of both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor- 1 and - 2 known to inhibit the binding of VEGF and placental growth factor (PlGF) to VEGF receptor- 1 and - 2. Here, we analyzed {{the mechanisms of}} the antitumor effects of aflibercept in mouse hepatoma models. METHODS: In in vitro studies, we determined the effects of aflibercept on human umbilical vein cell (HUVEC) proliferation and bone marrow (BM) cell differentiation to endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). In in vivo experiments, aflibercept was injected intraperitoneally in hepatoma cell tumor-bearing mice, and its inhibitory effects on tumor growth and BM cell migration to tumor tissues were evaluated. RESULTS: Aflibercept suppressed phosphorylation of VEGF receptor- 1 and - 2 in HUVEC and dose-dependently inhibited VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation. It suppressed the differentiation of BM cells to EPCs and migration of BM cells to tumor tissues. It also suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival time of tumor-bearing mice without side effects. In tumor tissues, aflibercept upregulated the expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 -α, VEGF, PlGF, fibroblast growth factor- 2, platelet derived growth factor-BB, and transforming growth factor-α and reduced microvascular density. It also reduced sinusoidal density in noncancerous liver tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated potent antitumor activity for aflibercept in a mouse model of <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma.

40|$|The tumor {{suppressors}} retinoblastoma (RB) and p 53 {{are important}} regulators {{of the cell}} cycle. Although human cancer cells inactivate RB and p 53 by many mechanisms, the cooperative roles of these proteins in tumorigenesis are complex and tissue specific. We analyzed the cooperation of RB and p 53 in liver development and pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Spontaneous and carcinogen-induced (diethylnitrosamine) tumorigenesis were studied in mice with liver-specific deletions of Rb and/or p 53 (Rbf/f;albcre+, p 53 f/f;albcre+ and Rbf/f; p 53 f/f;albcre+ mice). Genotype, histologic, immunohistochemical, microarray, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot, and comparative genomic hybridization analyses were performed using normal and tumor samples. Comparative microarray analyses were performed against publicly available human microarray data sets. Deletion of RB and p 53 from livers of mice deregulated the transcriptional programs associated with human disease. These changes were not sufficient for spontaneous tumorigenesis; potent quiescence mechanisms compensated for loss of these tumor suppressors. In response to hepatocarcinogen-induced damage, distinct and cooperative roles of RB and p 53 were revealed; their loss affected cell cycle control, checkpoint response, and genome stability. In damaged tissue, combined loss of RB and p 53 resulted in early lesion formation, aggressive tumor progression, and gene expression signatures and histologic characteristics of advanced human <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma. The <b>effects</b> RB and p 53 loss {{are determined by the}} tissue environment; cell stresses that promote aggressive disease reveal the functions of these tumor suppressors.

40|$|Sustained {{activation}} of the c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway mediates the development and progression of experimental diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Delineating the mechanism of JNK overactivation {{in the setting of}} a fatty liver is therefore essential to understanding the pathophysiology of NAFLD. Both human and experimental NAFLD are associated with oxidative stress and resultant lipid peroxidation, which have been proposed to mediate the progression of this disease from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis. The ability of oxidants and the lipid peroxidation product 4 -hydroxynonenal (HNE) to activate JNK signaling suggested that these two factors may act synergistically to trigger JNK overactivation. The effect of HNE on hepatocyte injury and JNK activation was therefore examined in cells under chronic oxidant stress from overexpression of the prooxidant enzyme cytochrome P 450 2 E 1 (CYP 2 E 1), which occurs in NAFLD. CYP 2 E 1 -generated oxidant stress sensitized a rat hepatocyte cell line to death from normally nontoxic concentrations of HNE. CYP 2 E 1 -overexpressing cells underwent a more profound depletion of glutathione (GSH) in response to HNE secondary to decreased γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase activity. GSH depletion led to over{{activation of}} JNK/c-Jun signaling at the level of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 that induced cell death.

Previous {{studies have shown that}} modulation of hepatic transporters by endogenous ligands and xenobiotics may represent a coordinated, hepatoprotective response of the liver against cellular distress. Altered disposition of xenobiotics, metabolites, and mediators of toxicity may contribute to peroxisome proliferator-mediated hepatoprotection. ^ The final studies examined the role of vanin- 1 in CFB-mediated hepatoprotection. Differential gene expression profiling analysis was utilized to identify potential mechanistic pathways of PPARα-mediated hepatoprotection.

Both cysteamine and cystamine are capable of preventing APAP hepatotoxicity in rodents and humans. Administration of peroxisome proliferators has been shown to increase the mRNA levels of vanin- 1, which may increase hepatic cysteamine and cystamine, providing hepatoprotection. ^ This investigation provides evidence suggesting that CFB-mediated hepatoprotection results from multiple mechanisms, including enhanced detoxification and anti-oxidant pathways as well as altered disposition of xenobiotics and mediators of toxicity.

The <b>effects</b> of external beam radiotherapy are improved by combining it with chemotherapy. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether such a synergistic effect could be demonstrated in vitro with internal radiation therapy. Methods: HepG 2 cells were cultured from Day 0 to Day 8 under the following conditions: exposure for 4 hr on Day 2 to increasing concentrations of 5 -fluorouracil (5 FU), doxorubicin or cisplatin (CDDP); exposure from Day 2 to Day 8 to increasing concentrations of 131 -liodide; exposure on Day 2 to low-toxicity doses of drugs for 4 hr, followed by exposure to 131 Iat increasing concentrations; and exposure to increasing concentrations of 131 I from Day 2 to Day 8, with exposure for 4 hr on Day 6 to the drugs. Cell toxicity was assessed by enzyme release (lactate dehydroge-nase and aspartate aminotransferase) in the culture medium and on cell survival (protein and tetrazolium dye test). All cultures were run in triplicate. Results: A dose- and time-dependent toxicity was demonstrated with doxorubicin and CDDP but not with 5 FU. When HepG 2 cells were exposed to 131 I,the toxicity was rather low, but significant, and was time- and dose-dependent. Treating these cells with combination radiotherapy and chemotherapy resulted in a toxicity that was significantly greater than that with 131 Ior chemo therapy drugs alone. Conclusion: The radiosensitivity of HepG 2 cells is low; combining a chemotherapeutic drug with a radiothera-peutic agent improves the radiosensitivity in a synergistic fashion.

40|$|Cholestatic liver injury {{following}} extra- or intrahepatic {{bile duct}} obstruction causes nonparenchymal cell proliferation and matrix deposition leading to end-stage liver disease and cirrhosis. In cholestatic conditions, nitric oxide (NO) is mainly {{produced by a}} hepatocyte-inducible NO synthase (iNOS) {{as a result of}} enhanced inflow of endotoxins to the liver and also by accumulation of bile salts in hepatocytes and subsequent hepatocellular injury. This study was aimed to investigate the role of NO and S-nitrosothiol (SNO) homeostasis in the development of hepatocellular injury during cholestasis induced by bile duct ligation (BDL) in rats. Male Wistar rats (200 - 250 g) were divided into four groups (n= 10 each), including sham-operated (SO), bile duct-ligated (BDL), tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA, 50 mg/kg) and S-methylisothiourea (SMT, 25 mg/kg) treated. After 7 days, BDL rats showed elevated serum levels of gamma-glutamiltranspeptidase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, LDH, and bilirubin, bile duct proliferation and fibrosis, compared with the SO group. TUDCA treatment did not significantly alter these parameters, but the iNOS inhibitor SMT ameliorated hepatocellular injury, as shown by lower levels of circulating hepatic enzymes and bilirubin, and a decreased grade of bile duct proliferation and fibrosis. Both TUDCA and SMT treatments reversed Mrp 2 canalicular pump expression to control levels. However, only SMT treatment significantly lowered the increased levels of plasma NO and S-nitrosation (S-nitrosylation) of liver proteins in BDL rats. Moreover, BDL resulted in a reduction of the S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR/Adh 5) enzymatic activity and a downregulation of the GSNOR/Adh 5 mRNA expression that was reverted by SMT, but not TUDCA, treatment. A total of 25 liver proteins, including S-adenosyl methionine synthetase, betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase, Hsp 90 and protein disulfide isomerase, were found to be S-nitrosated in BDL rats.

This study investigated the effect of A. muciniphila on immune-mediated liver injury and potential underlying mechanisms. Twenty-two C 57 BL/ 6 mice were assigned to three groups (N = 7 – 8 per group) and continuously administrated A. muciniphila MucT or PBS by oral gavage for 14 days. Mouse feces were collected for gut microbiota analysis on the 15 th day, and acute liver injury was induced by Concanavalin A (Con A, 15 mg/kg) injection through the tail vein. Samples (blood, liver, ileum, colon) were assessed for liver injury, systemic inflammation, and intestinal barrier function. We found that oral administration of A. muciniphila decreased serum ALT and AST and alleviated liver histopathological damage induced by Con A. Serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL- 2, IFN-γ, IL- 12 p 40, MCP- 1, MIP- 1 a, MIP- 1 b) were substantially attenuated. A. muciniphila significantly decreased hepatocellular apoptosis; Bcl- 2 expression increased, but Fas and DR 5 decreased. Further investigation showed that A. muciniphila enhanced expression of Occludin and Tjp- 1 and inhibited CB 1 receptor, which strengthened intestinal barriers and reduced systemic LPS level. Fecal 16 S rRNA sequence analysis indicated that A. muciniphila increased microbial richness and diversity. The community structure of the Akk group clustered distinctly from that of mice pretreated with PBS. Relative abundance of Firmicutes increased, and Bacteroidetes abundance decreased. Correlation analysis showed that injury-related factors (IL- 12 p 40, IFN-γ, DR 5) were negatively associated with specific genera (Ruminococcaceae_UCG_ 009, Lachnospiraceae_UCG_ 001, Akkermansia), which were enriched in mice pretreated with A. muciniphila. Our results suggested that A. muciniphila MucT had beneficial effects on immune-mediated liver injury by alleviating inflammation and <b>hepatocellular</b> death.

Recent human {{studies have shown that}} the magnitude of inhibitory interactions caused by the reversible CYP 1 A 2 inhibitor fluvoxamine decreases as liver function worsens, and virtually vanishes in patients with more advanced <b>hepatocellular</b> insufficiency. This <b>effect</b> of liver dysfunction is independent of the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the CYP 1 A 2 substrate, since it has been observed with both high- and low-clearance drugs. It is most probably due to reduced uptake of the inhibitory drug by the cirrhotic liver. In order to ascertain whether this is a general phenomenon, the following questions remain to be addressed: 1) whether the inhibition of any CYP isoform is reduced in liver disease; 2) whether the effect of liver dysfunction depends on the chemical nature of the inhibitory drug, since both reduced in vivo inhibition and in vitro uptake by the cirrhotic liver have so far been shown only for basic drugs; 3) lastly, if similar effects can also be observed with irreversible and quasi-irreversible inhibitors, as their accumulation kinetics in the hepatocyte may differ from those of a reversible inhibitor. Although many in vivo and in vitro studies have examined the inducibility of drug-metabolizing enzymes in liver disease, available data are incomplete and conflicting, since both well-preserved and severely curtailed responses to inducing agents have been reported. The reasons for these variable responses are most probably methodological, i. e., differences in the type and degree of liver dysfunction of the animals and patients examined, and in the type and dosage of the inducing agent used. Nonetheless, the results of those few studies which used pathologically homogeneous animal or patient groups suggest that, like basal enzyme expression, drug-inducible expression is also substantially preserved in mild to moderate liver disease, whereas it is lost in severe hepatic dysfunction. For a definitive conclusion, further studies are necessary which examine etiologically homogeneous patient groups and stratify patients rigorously according to their functional hepatic reserve. Such studies should also examine inducers with different physicochemical properties and acting by different mechanisms, since the expression of both hepatic transporters and nuclear receptors may be differentially affected by liver function impairment...|$|R
