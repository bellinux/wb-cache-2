40|$|Increasing {{composting}} activity will be {{an integral}} part of meeting the obligations of EU Directives, however, the extent to which composting at home can play its part still remains poorly defined. Reliable and comprehensive statistics on home composting are very difficult to obtain as the activity cannot be monitored effectively. It is an activity that is entirely in the hands of the people, and it is the voluntary behaviours of those people, that will ultimately determine the success of home composting within any waste management strategy. Understanding home composting means understanding the people that compost. To date, most waste management strategies have concentrated on recycling with relatively little attention being paid to home composting. According to requirements of EU Directives and legislation on landfilling of waste sustainable waste management practices need to be developed. Composting of organic waste provides a viable alternative to landfill at the present time. Although home composting is rated highly on the hierarchy of control, little has been achieved in Ireland to develop home composting as an effective means of diverting the organic <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> from landfill.

However, working stage of WHRB is challenging as design is prepared depending on site constraints and it is expected to deliver high efficiency even when dealing with high velocity and high temperature flows. CFD is widely used to investigate the flow pattern, pressure drop across ducting and particle trajectory within various equipment. CFD can be used to address problems with existing geometrical or performance errors like erosion of duct material due to ash particles, flow non-uniformity at tube bundles entry. Such problems may lead to lower efficiency of the equipment. Therefore, CFD can provide insight in the behavior of the system and contribute to resolving the problem.

Fenton's reagent was found to oxidize preferably biodegradable organic matter of leachate. In consequence, {{a decrease in the}} biodegradability of leachates was observed after Fenton treatment for both leachates. Nevertheless, Fenton reaction proved to be a feasible technique for the oxidation of the leachate under study, and it can be considered a suitable treatment for this type of wastewaters...|$|R
