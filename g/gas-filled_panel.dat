40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{improvements in}} domestic refrigerator/freezers, are directly {{influenced by the}} overall thermal performance of the cabinet and doors. An advanced system for reducing heat gain is <b>Gas-Filled</b> <b>Panel</b> thermal insulation technology. Gas-Filled Panels contain a low-conductivity, inert gas at atmospheric pressure and employ a reflective baffle to suppress radiation and convection within the gas. This paper presents energy use test results for a 1993 model 500 liter top mount refrigerator/freezer operated with its original doors and {{with a series of}} alternative prototype doors. <b>Gas-Filled</b> <b>Panel</b> technology was used in two types of prototype refrigerator/freezer doors. In one design, panels were used in composite with foam in standard metal door pans; this design yielded no measurable energy savings. In the other design, special polymer door pans were fitted with panels that fill nearly all of the available insulation volume; this design yielded a 6. 5 % increase in energy efficiency for the entire refrigerator/freezer. The EPA Refrigerator Analysis computer program has been used to predict the change in daily energy consumption with the alternative doors. The computer model also projects a 25 % energy efficiency improvement for a refrigerator/freezer that would use <b>Gas-Filled</b> <b>Panel</b> insulation throughout the cabinet as well as the doors...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{data are}} {{presented}} on the thermal resistance of composite panels that incorporate superinsulation embedded in urethane foam. Composite panels were fabricated using {{four types of}} advanced insulations (three types of evacuated panel superinsulation and one type of <b>gas-filled</b> <b>panel),</b> and three foam blowing agents (CFC- 11, HCFC- 141 b, and HCFC- 142 b/ 22 blend). Panels were also fabricated with only the urethane foam {{to serve as a}} baseline. Thermal measurements were performed using an ASTM C 518 Heat Flow Meter Apparatus. The thermal resistances of the panels were measured over a two-year period to detect whether any significant changes occurred. A computer model was used to analyze the data, adjusting for differences in size of the advanced insulations, and extrapolating to different sizes of composite panels...|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€”The {{application}} of traditional thermal insulation materials requires thicker building envelopes {{in order to}} satisfy the requirements of the emerging zero energy and zero emission buildings. This work summarizes the steps from the state-of-the- art thermal insulation materials and solutions, like vacuum insulation <b>panels</b> (VIP), <b>gas-filled</b> <b>panels</b> (GFP) and aerogels which all have various drawbacks, to our concepts and experimental investigations for making superinsulation materials (SIM) like e. g. nano insulation materials (NIM) ...|$|R
40|$|With their thermal {{conductivity}} down to 10 mW/(mK), <b>gas-filled</b> <b>panels</b> (GFPs) {{are regarded as}} possible high performance thermal insulating solutions for building applications. However, thermal conductivities of respectively 46 and 40 mW/(mK) have so far been achieved for prototype air-filled and argon-filled panels, values slightly higher than currently traditional building insulation materials. Compared to other high performance thermal insulation materials and solutions, e. g. vacuum insulation panels (VIPs), the future of GFPs may therefore be questioned. Nevertheless, {{the application of a}} low-conductive gas and reflective barriers may have a potential in the development of new high performance thermal insulation materials. Within this work, a state-of-the-art review is given on the knowledge of GFPs for building applications today...|$|R
40|$|Vacuum {{insulation}} panels (VIPs) {{are regarded}} as one of the most promising high performance thermal insulation solutions on the market today. Thermal performances 3 to 6 times better than still-air are achieved by applying a vacuum to an encapsulated microporous material, resulting in a great potential combining the reduction of energy consumption in buildings with slim constructions. However, thermal bridging due to the panel envelope and a degradation of thermal performance through time occurs with the current technology. Both effects have to be taken into account in building applications and will diminish the overall thermal performance. This paper is as far as we know the first comprehensive review on VIPs. The properties, possibilities and requirements of foil encapsulated VIPs for building applications are studied based on literature study, with emphasis on the thermal bridging and the degradation through time. An extension is made towards <b>gas-filled</b> <b>panels</b> and aerogels, showing that VIPs are only one way to achieve a high performance thermal insulation solutions. Combining the technology of these solutions and others could lead to a new leap forward in high performance thermal insulation solutions. Possibilities such as vacuum insulation materials and nano insulation materials are proposed. status: publishe...|$|R
