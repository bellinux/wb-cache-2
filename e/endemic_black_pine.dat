40|$|The Salzmann pine (Pinus nigra ssp. salzmannii) is an <b>endemic</b> {{subspecies}} of <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> {{native to}} the Western Mediterranean basin. In Spain, Salzmann pine covers extensive areas (approx. 350 000 ha), while in France where few scattered populations subsist, its distribution area is estimated at approx. 3 000 ha. We used a dendroecological approach to understand the impact of climate fluctuations on Salzmann pine from France. Spatial and temporal variability of radial growth response was compared in three ecologically different populations (Conflent, Gorges du Tarn, Saint-Guilhem-le-D,sert). The Conflent population showed a strong sensitivity to spring precipitation deficits (March to June), while at Gorges du Tarn and Saint-Guilhem sites, autumn (October) {{of the previous year}} and winter (February) temperatures explained more variance than precipitations and were, respectively, negatively and positively correlated to radial growth. Although covering a limited distribution range in France, Salzmann pine demonstrated large differences in radial growth response to climate and soil variations...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{intensification}} of agriculture, there were a bigger and more often habitat loss and their fragmentation. These led to the decreasing {{of the size of}} suitable habitats and their isolation. The isolation of landscape fragments is a basic geographical characteristic, which {{plays an important role in}} the ecological invasions. The invasions generally cause major economic damages and they affect the loss of biological diversity in the stands. In this work, we focused on the effects of <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus nigra). This wood plant has been occurred in the Czech Republic since the Tertiary period and disappeared by the subsequent disintegration of continents. The aim of this study is to determine the influence of <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus nigra) on the invertebrates compared with the native stands of scots pine (Pinus sylvetris). The experiment was conducted at 35 plots in Central Bohemia (18 plots of Scots pine, 17 plots of <b>black</b> <b>pine).</b> The invertebrates were captured by light traps. The total abundance and biomass of invertebrates were determined from the captured samples. From the processed data was not proven negative impact on non-native <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> to overall abundance and biomass of invertebrates. This fact is most likely due to the phylogenetic relationship of both pine species. There were not found any differences in abundance and biomass of most herbivorous groups of invertebrates. However, in the <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> stands was reported a higher incidence of carnivorous species of invertebrates. The stands of the <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> have no negative impact on number of invertebrates in the Czech Republic, actually there was demonstrated even higher affinity of carnivorous species of invertebrates to the <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> trees...|$|R

40|$|Litter {{quality is}} an {{important}} determinant of soil organic matter formation. Changes of organic components were investigated along decomposition of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) leaf litter and <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus nigra Arn.) needle litter in the native adjacent coeval forest stands. To this purpose, data from proximate analyses were compared with those from CPMAS 13 C NMR. Newly shed leaf litter of black locust had significantly higher concentrations of ADSS (acid detergent soluble substances) as well as lower concentrations of cellulose and AUR (acid unhydrolyzable residues that include lignin) and higher AUR-to-Cellulose ratio than that of <b>black</b> <b>pine.</b> The 13 C CPMAS NMR spectra of newly shed leaf litter of black locust and <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> revealed that O-Alkyl-C components (including cellulose and hemicelluloses) accounted, respectively, for 53. 8 % and 61. 4 % of the total area of the spectra. All other C fractions were relatively more abundant in black locust than in <b>black</b> <b>pine.</b> Within individual sampling periods, relationships between residual litter mass and concentrations of ADSS, cellulose and AUR were examined, as were relationships between residual litter C and NMR fractions. Four periods were defined based {{on the slopes of}} the decomposition curve, with the length of period I defined by the start of a net decrease of AUR. Proximate analyses and NMR data showed changes in chemical composition over the decomposition process, as well as changes in decay rates of the residues, following different paths in the two litters. ADSS decayed faster in black locust litter; in contrast cellulose and AUR decayed faster in that of <b>black</b> <b>pine.</b> AUR concentration increased in both litters during decomposition; however, compared to <b>black</b> <b>pine,</b> the remaining litter of black locust was richer in AUR, despite the lower initial concentration, and had a higher AUR-to-Cellulose ratio. Phenol-C and Aryl-C decayed faster in black locust litter, while Alkyl-C decayed faster in that of <b>black</b> <b>pine.</b> In both litters, mass loss in periods was negatively correlated to concentration of AUR {{at the start of the}} periods. C loss in periods was negatively correlated to the concentration at the start of the periods of MC-to-PC (an index of lignin content) in black locust litter and positively correlated to Alkyl-C and O-Alkyl-C in that of <b>black</b> <b>pine.</b> Phenol-C, O-Alkyl-C and Aryl-C were the most decomposable C fractions in black locust. O-Alkyl-C and Alkyl-C were the most decomposable C fractions in <b>black</b> <b>pine.</b> Limit value was lower in <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> than in <b>black</b> locust. Consequently the different pattern of litter decomposition can affect the size of C sequestration in the forest floor and the quality of accumulated organic carbon...|$|R

40|$|Tree species {{influence}} {{organic matter}} sequestration in forest soil. We explored {{the pattern of}} soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic nitrogen (SON) sequestration in two 40 -year-old, adjacent forest stands, one with <b>Black</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus nigra Arn.) and one with Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.). We compared the patterns of annual carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sequestration in the organic and mineral soil layers of the two forests with literature data for < 100 years old deciduous and coniferous forests from different climatic zones. Carbon and N inputs, with aboveground litter fall, were significantly higher in the <b>Black</b> <b>pine</b> than in the Black locust stand. In the soil profile of the <b>Black</b> <b>pine</b> stand, the amount of SOC was significantly higher and that of SON significantly lower than in the Black locust stand. The average annual sequestration rates were 41. 3 and 75. 0 g C m- 2, and 2. 9 and 2. 6 g N m- 2, respectively, in the Black locust and the <b>Black</b> <b>pine</b> stands. In both forests most of SOC and SON was stored in the organic layers (OL and OF+OH). In the mineral soil layers the amount of SOC was similar for the two stands whereas the amount of SON was significantly higher in the Black locust stand (23. 7 vs 14. 6 g N m- 2). In all soil layers, the concentrations of water soluble organic matter (WSOM) {{were higher in the}} Black locust stand compared to that with <b>Black</b> <b>pine.</b> Manganese accumulated in the OF+OH layer of the <b>Black</b> <b>pine</b> stand. The results suggest different sequestration patterns, with higher SOC sequestration rates in the <b>Black</b> <b>pine</b> stand and higher SON sequestration rates in the Black locust stand. Comparison with literature data suggests this to be a generality in C and N sequestration patterns for coniferous and deciduous forests...|$|R
