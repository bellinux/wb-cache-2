United National Climate Change Conference, Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia, 3 - 14 December 2007, 39 pp. RONO: DB 05225 Summary for policymakers. Grasslands cover about 70 % of the world?s agricultural area. They have {{a crucial role}} in terms of food production and in the delivery of ecosystem services such as water supplies, biodiversity and carbon sequestration. The <b>grasslands</b> <b>of</b> the world face a range of challenges from climate change including the effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, increasing temperatures, changes in precipitation regime and higher concentrations of ground level ozone. These factors threaten productivity, species composition and quality, with potential impacts not only on livestock production but also on other aspects of the multifunctional role <b>of</b> <b>grasslands.</b> In a previous work we considered the contribution grasslands make to greenhouse gas emissions and the potential <b>of</b> genetic <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> key <b>grassland</b> species to reduce these emissions and enhance carbon sequestration in grassland soils. In this paper we summarize the targets and approaches plant breeding programmes should adopt to enable grasslands to adapt to climate change whilst realizing their potential contributions to food security and reducing the environmental impact of livestock agriculture. We focus on the following major challenges: (i) Developing grassland crops with improved drought tolerance and enhanced water use efficiency. (ii) Improving tolerance of saline soils (iii) Tolerance of floods and related consequences of changes in rainfall patterns (iv) Maintaining nutrient use efficiency and forage quality In general the most advanced examples are from work carried out on the key species <b>of</b> temperate <b>grasslands.</b> State <b>of</b> the art genomic approaches are beginning to be deployed in these crops.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, global changes {{have altered the}} {{structure}} and properties of natural and semi-natural mountain grasslands. Those changes have contributed to grassland loss mainly through colonization by woody species at low elevations, and increases in biomass and greenness at high elevations. Nevertheless, the interactions between agropastoral components; i. e., ecological (grassland, environmental, and geolocation properties), social, and economic components, and their effects on the grasslands are still poorly understood. We estimated the vulnerability <b>of</b> dense <b>grasslands</b> in the Central Pyrenees, Spain, based on the connectivity loss (CL) among grassland patches that has occurred between the 1980 s and the 2000 s, {{as a result of}} i) an increase in biomass and greenness (CL-IBG), ii) woody encroachment (CL-WE), or iii) a decrease in biomass and greenness (CL-DBG). The environmental and <b>grassland</b> components <b>of</b> the agropastoral system were associated with the three processes, especially CL-IBG and CL-WE, in relation with the succession of vegetation toward climax communities, fostered by land abandonment and exacerbated by climate warming. CL-IBG occurred in pasture units that had a high proportion <b>of</b> dense <b>grasslands</b> and low current livestock pressure. CL-WE was most strongly associated with pasture units that had a high proportion of woody habitat and a large reduction in sheep and goat pressure between the 1930 s and the 2000 s. The economic component was correlated with the CL-WE and the CL-DBG; specifically, expensive pastures were the most productive and could maintain the highest rates of livestock grazing, which slowed down woody encroachment, but caused grassland degradation and DBG. In addition, CL-DBG was associated with geolocation <b>of</b> <b>grasslands,</b> mainly because livestock tend to graze closer to passable roads and buildings, where they cause grassland degradation. To properly manage the grasslands, an integrated management plan must be developed that includes an understanding of all components of the agropastoral system and takes into account all changes that have occurred in dense mountain grasslands.

40|$|Abstract. With seeds {{collected}} in 2001 – 2002 from semi natural <b>grasslands</b> <b>of</b> Estonia, plot trials {{were established in}} 2003 {{in order to determine}} the ability of lucerne populations, their suitability for breeding purposes and prospective ways of use. In the sum of dry matter yields of the sowing year and three years of use, one natural population (Reigi) exceeded the standard variety by 6. 0 %, but in the crude protein yield it was within the experimental error inferior to the standard. From plant breeding perspective this population is of interest. However, it must be checked whether the location where seeds were collected was not a former sowing place of some existing foreign variety. The rest of the tested populations can be divided into two groups based on their growth rhythm and dry matter yield: 1) with modest regrowth, predominantly yellow-flowered forms of Medicago falcata L. type spreading by rhizomes deserve attention as initial material for breeding of specific varieties for landscape management. Particular longevity of the variety and low management costs are highly valued, but the biochemical composition of the yield (dry matter and crude protein yields account for 48. 0 – 55. 7 % and 49. 6 – 59. 2 % respectively, compared to the standard variety) is of minor importance, 2) yellow- and multicolour-flowered populations of M. media Pers., which dry matter and crude protein yields ranged between 65. 8 – 92. 0 % and 64. 5 – 86. 2 % respectively, in comparison with standard variety.

40|$|Understanding the {{influences}} of different utilization patterns in different grassland types on grassland traits is essential for grassland conservation and <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> management. Grazing, mowing, and fencing {{have the potential to}} substantially affect vegetation characteristics. The general pattern and mechanisms for relationships between vegetation characteristics and abiotic factors are fundamental issues in ecology. The effect of the key factors on vegetation traits under different management practices has been rarely comprehensively elucidated in previous studies,especially across the temperate grasslands in the Hulunbuir region. Therefore, the principal purposes of this study were: (1) to analyze the effects of different management practices on vegetation characteristics using data investigated from 23 sites across the temperate grasslands; (2) to explore the relationship of environmental factors with vegetation dynamics, and to identify the main factors using correlation analysis; and (3) to predict the evolution of vegetation dynamics with the major factors using the generalized additive modelat the landscape scale. The study area is situated at the western part of Mt. Daxing'anling, Hulunbuir, Inner Mongolia, China. Samples were collected in the grasslands utilized for grazing (always from 10 sampled sites), mowing (since 2003, from 6 sampled sites), and fencing (since 2003, from 7 samples sites). In each site, we investigated above ground biomass, below ground, litter, coverage and soil properties in five plots (1 m x 1 m) at a 10 m interval along a transect. Data pertaining to the environmental factors and vegetation characteristics in different utilization types were compared using ANOVA. The relationship of the main elements with vegetation traits was analyzed using CA in these utilization types. GAM analysis was conducted to explore the evolutionary trend of vegetation dynamics with respect to the critical factors at the landscape scale. Fencing and mowing practices, which can improve vegetation traits, and increase grassland carbon sink, should be continued to promote the Hulunbuir grasslands, rather than grazing management. Thus, appropriate reforms concerning the proper utilize the grassland (e. g. mowing and fencing) is necessary to ensure sustainability of the grassland ecological system, and what is more, the effects of the ecological project in the sustainable development of the temperate grasslands in the Hulunbuir region should be gradually explored...|$|E

40|$|The grasslands, {{like the}} {{majority}} of the terrestrial systems, are complex ecosystems and such complexity comes from the high number of biotic and abiotic elements which form this systems and from the interactions between the same elements, which could vary in time and space their nature and intensity. Keeping attention to this complexity and knowing that there is an equilibrium state in which the plant community has the maximum possible number of species, for a certain soil-climate context, this research work is centred on the description of the components <b>of</b> the <b>grassland</b> ecosystem, <b>of</b> the relations which exist between them and on the possible way of management, to achieve improvements in the future, in terms of productivity of phytocoenosis, of soil defending, of biodiversity conservation and also in terms of improving the life conditions of human population. In particular, the main target of this phD was to create an exhaustive knowledge structure about Apennines grasslands, because until now, all the studies made were partial, tending to characterize the herbaceous communities from a phytosociological viewpoint, but not ecological-functional. Moreover, considering the size of the study area and the complexity of the research and of the management <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> ecosystems, we thought to share the research work in the three years, the timing and the operations. In fact, the research plan was structured like a “pyramid” at the base of which there is the phytosociological research which is the support to all the other studies, while regarding on the timing we decided to concentrate each year in a bioclimatic belt, following this scheme: 1 th year: − bibliography research − phytosociological survey <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher mesotemperate and lower supratemperate belts − set up a sampling method for the ecological survey 2 th year: − phytosociological survey <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher supratemperate belt − Ecological structure analysis <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher mesotemperate and lower supratemperate belts − sinecological analysis <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher mesotemperate and lower supratemperate belts − analysis of the vegetation for a zootechnical characterization <b>of</b> <b>grasslands</b> <b>of</b> higher mesotemperate and higher/lower supratemperate belts 3 th year: − phytosociological survey <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> orotemperate and criotemperate belts − ecological structure analysis <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher supratemperate belts − sinecological analysis <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher supratemperate belt − zootechnical characterization <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher mesotemperate and higher/lower supratemperate belts [ [...] . ] In the three years it was possible to finish all the phytosociological, ecological and zootechnical researches for the <b>grasslands</b> <b>of</b> higher mesotemperate and lower/higher supratemperate belts; then it was possible to implement phytosociological and sinecological knowledges <b>of</b> the <b>grasslands</b> <b>of</b> orotemperate belt and to realize a phytosociological placement of the herbaceous commmunities of criotemperate belt...|$|R

40|$|To {{improve our}} {{understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> dynamics under {{different levels of}} utilization, a functional description of the vegetation was introduced in a deterministic model. The selected traits and their parameterization {{were based on the}} results of a long-term experiment in which temperate grasslands were managed for 12 years with three levels of herbage use: high, medium and low. The integration of functional attributes of the community species within the model’s parameters can be seen as a new step in the study <b>of</b> the <b>grassland</b> ecosystem. With this tool, it is possible to decrease the number of interconnections in the system and consequently decrease the complexity. In this work a, functional definition <b>of</b> three different <b>grassland</b> communities was introduced into the sub-vegetation model. This was done by interchanging the model’s parameters with the functional attributes of the communities. From the conceptual point of view, the sub-vegetation model works adequately and it seems suitable to simulate the dynamic <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> vegetation described by functional traits. The model fits experimental data well for high levels of utilization, but was poorly adjusted at medium and low levels of herbage use. We believe this is due to a better simulation of green biomass fluxes than for senescence or reproductive fluxes. Some possible <b>improvements</b> <b>of</b> the model are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of GeographyMelinda DanielsThe Lesser Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) is {{a prairie}} grouse of {{conservation}} {{concern in the}} Southern Great Plains. In response to declining population numbers and ongoing threats to its habitat, the Lesser Prairie-Chicken was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in May 2014. In western Kansas, the Lesser Prairie-Chicken occupies the Sand Sagebrush Prairie, Mixed-grass Prairie, and Short-grass/CRP Mosaic Ecoregions. Since {{the beginning of the}} 20 th century, the overall range and population has declined by 92 % and 97 % respectively. Much of this decline is attributed to the loss and fragmentation <b>of</b> native <b>grasslands</b> throughout the Lesser Prairie-Chicken range. Whereas much of the loss and degradation <b>of</b> native <b>grassland</b> have been attributed to anthropogenic activities such as conversion <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> to cropland and energy exploration, federal legislation since the 1980 s to convert cropland on highly erodible soils to perennial grasses through the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) may curtail or reverse these trends. My objective was to document changes in the areal extent and connectivity <b>of</b> <b>grasslands</b> in the identified Lesser Prairie-Chicken range in Kansas from the 1950 s to 2013 using remotely sensed data. I hypothesized that the total amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> decreased between the 1950 ’s and 2013 because of an increase in agricultural practices, but predicted an increase <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> between 1985 and 2013 in response to the CRP. To document changes in grassland, land cover maps were generated through spectral classification of LANDSAT images and visual analysis of aerial photographs from the Army Map Service and USDA Farm Service Agency. Landscape composition and configuration were assessed using FRAGSTATS to compute a variety of landscape metrics measuring changes in the amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> present as well as changes in the size and configuration <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> patches. Since 1985, the amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> in the Lesser Prairie-Chicken range in Kansas has increased by 210, 9963. 3 ha, a rise of 11. 9 %, while the mean patch size and area-weighted mean patch size <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> increased 18. 2 % and 23. 0 % respectively, indicating grassland has become more connected during this time in response to the CRP. Prior to the implementation of CRP, the amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> had been decreasing since 1950, as 66, 722. 0 ha <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> was converted to croplands. The loss <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> had a considerable effect on the patch size <b>of</b> <b>grasslands,</b> as mean patch size and area-weighted mean patch size decreased by 8. 8 % and 11. 1 % respectively. The primary driver <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> loss between 1950 and 1985 was the emergence of center pivot irrigation, which had its greatest impact in western and southwestern parts of the range in Kansas. In particular, while the amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> in Range 5, a region of the Lesser Prairie-Chicken range found in southwest Kansas, has increased overall since the 1950 s by 4. 7 %, the area-weighted mean patch size has decreased by 53. 0 % in response to center pivot irrigation fragmenting the landscape. While the CRP has been successful in increasing and connecting grassland throughout the Lesser Prairie-Chicken range to offset the loss <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> since the 1950 s, continuation of the CRP faces an uncertain future in the face of rising commodity prices, energy development, and reduction in program scope leaving open the possibility that these areas that have created habitat for Lesser Prairie-Chickens could be lost. As time progresses, a reduction in the scope of the CRP would reduce the amount of habitat available to Lesser Prairie-Chickens, threatening the persistence of their population...|$|R
