50|$|An <b>isoclinic</b> <b>line</b> connects {{points of}} equal {{magnetic}} dip, and an aclinic {{line is the}} <b>isoclinic</b> <b>line</b> of magnetic dip zero.|$|E
5000|$|An isogon (from [...] or gonia, meaning 'angle') is a {{contour line}} for a {{variable}} which measures direction. In meteorology and in geomagnetics, the term isogon has specific meanings which are described below. An isocline (from [...] or klinein, meaning 'to lean or slope') is a line joining points with equal slope. In population dynamics and in geomagnetics, the terms isocline and <b>isoclinic</b> <b>line</b> have specific meanings which are described below.|$|E
30|$|If 0 < h< x^*< h+p< K holds, {{then the}} point E^*(x^*,y^*) {{is between the}} {{impulsive}} set M and the phase set N. The <b>isoclinic</b> <b>line</b> ẋ= 0 intersects the impulsive set M at the point F_ 1 (h,y_F_ 1). The impulsive set M intersects the x-axis at the point M^'(h, 0), and the intersection point of the phase set N and the x-axis is the point N^'(h+p, 0).|$|E
40|$|A {{measurement}} system of stress distribution in granular systems were developed using photoelasticity. Stress transmission among {{two types of}} acrylic resin cylinders with diameters of 8 mm or 10 mm and a height of 10 mm were measured by using the stress {{measurement system}} based on photoelasticity. Photoelastic fringe patterns of <b>isoclinic</b> <b>lines</b> and isochromatic lines in the acrylic resin cylinders were observed. As a preliminary result，we observed the stress distribution and heterogeneous stress transmission in the granular system under compression. A contact network of a granular system {{was obtained from the}} photoelastic fringe pattern...|$|R
50|$|Magnetic dip {{results from}} the {{tendency}} of a magnet to align itself with lines of magnetic field. As the Earth's magnetic field lines are not parallel to the surface, {{the north end of}} a compass needle will point downward in the northern hemisphere (positive dip) or upward in the southern hemisphere (negative dip). The range of dip is from -90 degrees (at the South Magnetic Pole) to +90 degrees (at the North Magnetic Pole). Contour lines along which the dip measured at the Earth's surface is equal are referred to as <b>isoclinic</b> <b>lines.</b> The locus of the points having zero dip is called the magnetic equator or aclinic line.|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} article {{demonstrates the}} application of PhotoStressR method in stress analysis of a rotating disc of a constant thickness, which was made of a photoelastic material PS- 1 A. Isoclinic fringes were observed on the rotating disc using linear polarized light at revolutions 5 000 RPM. Observations were carried out under angle parameter 0 o to 90 o with 10 o increase. A set of isostatic lines of I and II set was made from the set of obtained <b>isoclinic</b> <b>lines.</b> During gradual increase of rotations of the rotating disc up to 17 000 RPM, and with circular polarized light, we observed the distribution of colourful isochromatic fringes on the rotating disc. The field of isochromatic fringes, gained experimentally, at 15 000 RPM was compared with the field which was gained {{by means of a}} numerical analysis...|$|R
