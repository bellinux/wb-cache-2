500|$|During {{the late}} 19th century, <b>glass</b> <b>blowers</b> were {{difficult}} to find. Belgium was the largest exporter of window glass to the United States, and plant manager Heagany previously used the skills of <b>glass</b> <b>blowers</b> from that country in his Kokomo glass works. [...] In Hartford City, Heagany again relied upon Belgian workers for the skilled positions in his glass works.|$|R

500|$|The glass {{blowing machine}} used by American Window Glass {{factories}} {{was created by}} Pittsburgh resident John H. Lubbers, and he continued to contribute improvements to the machine over the next decade. [...] By using the Lubbers machine, human <b>glass</b> <b>blowers</b> were replaced with a machine operator paid 30 percent of the <b>glass</b> <b>blower</b> wage. The machine was also five times more productive than the human blowers. It could make windows four times as large because a larger cylinder was extracted from the tank of molten glass. [...] Thus, the highest–paid skilled workers in the United States were considered obsolete. In the case of Hartford City, machines replaced most of the human <b>glass</b> <b>blowers</b> by 1908.|$|R
500|$|In {{the first}} step of the glass-making process, molten glass was {{extracted}} from the pot or tank. The <b>glass</b> <b>blower</b> and his helper used a blowpipe, which was typically [...] to [...] long, to create a bubble of molten <b>glass.</b> The <b>glass</b> <b>blower</b> manipulated the bubble into a cylinder, and removed it from the pot or tank. The cylinders were [...] to [...] in diameter, and [...] or [...] long.|$|R

500|$|The {{window glass}} {{manufacturing}} process used by Hartford City Glass {{was known as}} the Cylinder Method. [...] The process was labor-intensive, and required the services of a <b>glass</b> <b>blower</b> and <b>glass</b> cutter—who were both highly skilled and well paid. The <b>glass</b> <b>blower</b> led a small production crew that included skilled and unskilled workers. At older plants, the <b>glass</b> <b>blower's</b> workstation was adjacent to a ceramic pot located inside the furnace. Each pot contained molten glass created by melting a batch of ingredients that included sand, soda, and lime. [...] At newer plants such as the Hartford City works, tanks were used instead of pots. The tanks were essentially huge brick pots with multiple workstations. A tank furnace is more efficient than a pot furnace, but more costly to build.|$|R

50|$|On the {{recommendation}} of Frank Thrower, a potter and amateur glassware designer, the trust recruited Eskil Vilhemson, a Swedish glass manufacturer, to be the company's Managing Director. A team of Scandinavian <b>glass</b> <b>blowers</b> came with him to Torrington, {{some of whom are}} still there to this day, and the factory opened in June 1967 under the name of Dartington Glass. A year later in 1969 more <b>glass</b> <b>blowers</b> followed, one Italian and a couple from Denmark.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} step of the glass-making process, molten glass was {{extracted}} from the pot or tank. The <b>glass</b> <b>blower</b> and his helper used a blowpipe, which was typically 4 ft to 5 ft long, to create a bubble of molten <b>glass.</b> The <b>glass</b> <b>blower</b> manipulated the bubble into a cylinder, and removed it from the pot or tank. The cylinders were 12 in to 16 in in diameter, and 4 ft or 5 ft long.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>glass</b> <b>blowers</b> faced a major {{challenge}} in the 1880s from a new union, the American Flint Glass Workers' Union of North America (AFGWU). Flint glass, commonly known as [...] "crystal", was made in closed pots to protect the glass from impurities (unlike green glass), and generally the flint glass workforce was more highly skilled. The AFGWU formed in Pittsburgh in 1878, and within four short years had locals throughout West Virginia and Ohio and was spreading east. Feeling threatened by the new union, the <b>Glass</b> <b>Blowers</b> waged several bitter jurisdictional strikes against the AFGWU in the 1880s and 1890s. The union's jurisdictional fight was an important one. Highly skilled workers like <b>glass</b> <b>blowers</b> made up 15 {{percent of the entire}} workforce. While 45 percent of American workers made just enough money in the 1880s to be at or above the poverty line ($500 a year), another 30 percent made less than that. A shocking 10 percent of all full-time workers made so little money they were considered absolutely destitute. <b>Glass</b> <b>blowers,</b> however, made 60 to 100 percent more than the average worker, and were considered the [...] "cream" [...] of the working class.|$|R
