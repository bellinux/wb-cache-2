5|$|The shaded north {{slopes of}} cinder cones provide more {{protection}} from <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight</b> and prevailing southwesterly winds {{and have a}} more persistent snow cover (an important water source in early spring). These parts of cinder cones are therefore colonized by plants first.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds are diurnal: they feed, breed {{and defend}} territories during the day. Many {{of the family}} are, however, {{reluctant}} to enter areas of <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight</b> where it breaks through the forest canopy. Antbirds will engage in anting, a behaviour in which ants (or other arthropods) are rubbed on the feathers before being discarded or eaten. While this has conventionally been considered a way to remove and control feather parasites, {{it has been suggested}} that for antbirds it may simply be a way to deal with the distasteful substances in prey items.|$|E

50|$|To further {{optimize}} {{the use of}} solar light, a heliostat can be installed which tracks {{the movement of the}} sun, thereby <b>directing</b> <b>sunlight</b> into the light tube at all times of the day as far as the surroundings´ limitations allow, possibly with additional mirrors or other reflective elements that influence the light path. The heliostat can be set to capture moonlight at night.|$|R

5|$|The shuttle {{has moved}} into <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight</b> and Mission Control is unable to rotate it into a safe position, putting the astronauts' lives in danger. Generoo {{believes}} that the uplink is being sabotaged. Belt orders the uplink to be cut, allowing the astronauts to rotate the craft manually. Over the objections of Generoo and the agents, Belt orders the mission to proceed and lies to the press about its progress. Belt tells Mulder that the shuttle program may be cancelled if the mission is not completed successfully.|$|E
5|$|In {{its natural}} habitat, N. rajah grows in open areas, {{where it is}} exposed to <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight</b> – it {{therefore}} needs to be provided with {{a significant amount of}} light in cultivation as well. To meet this need, many growers have used metal halide lamps in the 500–1000watt range, with considerable success. The plant should be situated a fair distance from the light source, 1 to 2 m is recommended. Depending on location, growers can utilise natural sunlight as a source of illumination. However, this is only recommended for those living in equatorial regions, where light intensity is sufficient to satisfy the needs of the plant. A photoperiod of 12hours is comparable to that experienced in nature, since Borneo lies on the equator.|$|E
5|$|Metal armour was {{of limited}} {{use in the}} hot, wet {{tropical}} climate. It was heavy {{and had to be}} constantly cleaned to prevent rusting; in <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight,</b> metal armour became unbearably hot. Conquistadores often went without metal armour, or only donned it immediately prior to battle. They were quick to adopt quilted cotton armour based upon that used by their native opponents, and commonly combined this {{with the use of a}} simple metal war hat. Shields were considered essential by both infantry and cavalry; generally this was a circular target shield, convex in form and fashioned from iron or wood. Rings secured it to the arm and hand.|$|E
50|$|A Grubb Parson 60 cm {{diameter}} two-mirror {{fused quartz}} coelostat mounted on 11 m tower platform <b>directs</b> <b>sunlight</b> via a flat mirror into a 60 m long underground horizontal 'tunnel'. A 38 cm aperture f/90 achromat forms a 34 cm diameter solar image at the focal plane. The telescope has {{an option to}} mount a 20 cm achromat, which provides an f/90 beam to form a 17 cm image.|$|R
30|$|A solar {{reflector}} {{was designed}} through the repurposing of satellite dishes into a reflective parabolic mirror {{to serve as}} the sole heat source for synthetic chemical reactions [9]. The surface of the satellite dish was completely covered with Mylar® tape to give it reflective properties capable of generating heat when directed at the sun. The feed horn of the satellite dish was removed and reaction flasks were placed in this position in order to achieve maximum intensity from the <b>directed</b> <b>sunlight.</b>|$|R

5|$|Nest size {{depends on}} species of bumblebee. Most form colonies of between 50 and 400 individuals, but colonies have been {{documented}} as small as ~20 individuals and as large as 1700. These nests are small compared to honeybee hives, which hold about 50,000 bees. Many species nest underground, choosing old rodent burrows or sheltered places, and avoiding places that receive <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight</b> {{that could result in}} overheating. Other species make nests above ground, whether in thick grass or in holes in trees. A bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honeybee; the cells are instead clustered together untidily. The workers remove dead bees or larvae from the nest and deposit them outside the nest entrance, helping to prevent disease. Nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter.|$|E
5|$|P. fimbriata {{is found}} in the rain forests of India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Malaysia {{including}} Malacca, Indonesia, and in Australia's Northern Territory and Queensland. It lives on foliage, tree trunks, boulders, and rock walls. Throughout its range, this is the most common species of the genus Portia. Queensland specimens of P. fimbriata live near running water and where there is moderate light, while Northern Territory specimens live in caves where the light varies from rather dark at the back to much brighter around the mouths. Other populations of Portia also live with higher light levels than in Queensland, and some members of these other populations are found in webs exposed to <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight</b> for part of the day. In Queensland, P. fimbriata shares its environment with a common prey, the very abundant Jacksonoides queenslandicus, and with large populations of other non-Portia salticids and non-salticid web-building spiders.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers of}} sundews, as with nearly all {{carnivorous}} plants, are held {{far above the}} leaves by a long stem.This physical isolation of the flower from the traps was originally thought to be an adaptation meant to avoid trapping potential pollinators; a recent study, however, indicated Drosera species attract distinct types of insects as pollinators and prey, with little overlap. Instead, the tall flower stalks probably help raise the flowers to a height where they are noticeable to pollinators. The mostly unforked inflorescences are spikes, whose flowers open {{one at a time}} and usually only remain open for a short period. Flowers open in response to light intensity (often opening only in <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight),</b> and the entire inflorescence is also helitropic, moving in response to the sun's position in the sky.|$|E
5000|$|The Reichstag dome is a {{large glass}} dome with a 360 degree view of the {{surrounding}} Berlin cityscape. The debating chamber of the Bundestag, the German parliament, can be seen below. A mirrored cone {{in the center of}} the dome <b>directs</b> <b>sunlight</b> into the building, and so that visitors can see the working of the chamber. The dome is open to the public and can be reached by climbing two steel, spiraling ramps that are reminiscent of a double-helix. [...] The Dome symbolizes that the people are above the government, as was not the case during National Socialism.|$|R

30|$|A solar {{reflector}} {{was designed}} through the repurposing of unused satellite dishes into a reflective parabolic mirror {{that will serve}} as the sole heat source to drive synthetic chemical reactions to completion [17]. To transform the satellite dishes into solar reflectors, the surface of the dish was completely covered with Metalized Mylar® tape to attain the reflective properties needed to generate heat. It was discovered that the feed horn of the satellite dish is located at the focal point. Therefore, the feed horn of the dish was removed and reaction flasks were placed in this position in order to achieve maximum intensity from the <b>directed</b> <b>sunlight.</b>|$|R
5|$|The region's {{precipitation}} pattern is bimodal, meaning agriculture is sustained through snowfall during winter and autumn and rainfall during spring and summer. The climate is semi-arid. Water for farming and consumption {{was provided by}} summer rains, winter snowfall, and seeps and springs in and near the Mesa Verde villages. At , the middle mesa areas were typically ten degrees Fahrenheit (5.5°C) cooler than the mesa top, which reduced {{the amount of water}} needed for farming. The cliff dwellings were built to take advantage of solar energy. The angle of the sun in winter warmed the masonry of the cliff dwellings, warm breezes blew from the valley, and the air was ten to twenty degrees warmer in the canyon alcoves than {{on the top of the}} mesa. In the summer, with the sun high overhead, much of the village was protected from <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight</b> in the high cliff dwellings.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{in which}} the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight</b> {{into the darkness of}} Earth's shadow, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope. A shroud of multi-layer insulation keeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell {{in which the}} telescope and instruments sit. Within the shell, a graphite-epoxy frame keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned. Because graphite composites are hygroscopic, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space.|$|E
25|$|Sunlight: Trees {{generally}} {{require a}} good deal of sun, and most bonsai need <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight</b> during the growing season to thrive. Some shade-tolerant species of bonsai cannot thrive with too much <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight,</b> however, and it is the grower's role to site the bonsai specimens to provide the correct lighting for each type. Most bonsai will be located in an area that gets several hours of direct daylight. Shade-tolerant bonsai can be placed behind barriers (walls, buildings), sited on shaded benches or stands, or shaded by netting to reduce the impact of <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight.</b>|$|E
25|$|Exposure to {{the intense}} {{radiation}} of <b>direct,</b> unfiltered <b>sunlight</b> {{would lead to}} local heating, though that would likely be well distributed by the body's conductivity and blood circulation. Other solar radiation, particularly ultraviolet rays, however, may cause severe sunburn.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} known to {{withstand}} temperatures down to at least -2 or -5 degrees Celsius if kept completely dry. It is not known {{to do well in}} <b>direct,</b> intense <b>sunlight,</b> mainly in summer months. It is also sensitive to red spider mite.|$|R

Supplemental floodlights were used when the sun was inadequate.|$|R

Robert Metcalf, a microbiologist at California State University in Sacramento, USA, has found that a solar box designed in the 1970 s can cook food for a whole family in two to four hours and can also sterilize water and pasteurize milk.
