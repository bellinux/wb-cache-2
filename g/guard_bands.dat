In this case, the <b>guard</b> <b>band</b> can be reduced to a total of 127 byte: 64 byte (minimum frame) + 63 byte (remaining length that cannot be pre-empted).

50|$|To {{partially}} {{mitigate the}} loss of bandwidth through the <b>guard</b> <b>band,</b> the standard IEEE 802.1Qbv includes a length-aware scheduling mechanism. This mechanism is used when store-and-forward switching is utilized: after the full reception of an Ethernet frame {{that needs to be}} transmitted on a port where the <b>guard</b> <b>band</b> is in effect, the scheduler checks the overall length of the frame. If the frame can fit completely inside the <b>guard</b> <b>band,</b> without any infringement of the following high priority slice, the scheduler can send this frame, despite an active <b>guard</b> <b>band,</b> and reduce the waste of bandwidth. This mechanism, however, cannot be used when cut-through switching is enabled, since the total length of the Ethernet frame needs to be known a priori. Therefore, when cut-through switching is used to minimize end-to-end latency, the waste of bandwidth will still occur. Also, this does not help with the minimum achievable cycle time. Therefore, length-aware scheduling is an improvement, but cannot mitigate all drawbacks that are introduced by the <b>guard</b> <b>band.</b>|$|R
