50|$|Historians credit Britain with {{a highly}} {{successful}} record of mobilising the home front for the war effort, in terms of mobilising the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximising output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people. Much of this success {{was due to the}} systematic planned mobilisation of women, as workers, soldiers and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription. The women supported the war effort, and made the rationing of consumer goods a success. In some ways, the government over-responded, evacuating too many children in the first days of the war, closing cinemas as frivolous then reopening them when the need for cheap entertainment was clear, sacrificing cats and dogs to save a little space on shipping pet food, only to discover an urgent need to keep the rats and mice under control. In the balance between compulsion and voluntarism, the British relied successfully on voluntarism. The success of the government in providing new services, such as hospitals and school lunches, as well as egalitarian spirit, contributed to widespread support for an enlarged welfare state. Munitions production rose dramatically, and the quality remained high. Food production was emphasised, in large part to free shipping for munitions. Farmers increased the number of acres under cultivation from 12,000,000 to 18,000,000 (from about 50,000 to 75,000 km2), and the <b>farm</b> <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> was expanded by a fifth, thanks especially to the Women's Land Army.|$|E

The data suggested an ageing <b>farm</b> <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> in the study area, Abia State.

With a coefficient of multiple determination (R 2 -value) of 0. 895 and a highly significant F-ratio, the regression model showed that the socio-economic variables strongly influenced adult equivalent labour supply. It is suggested that governments and policy makers must articulate rural development strategies that can reduce the high rate of youth outmigration from rural areas.

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} on 224 randomly selected farmers, comprising those participating and non-participating in a goat corssbreeding project in Burundi, and 54 farmers chosen as `breeders' by the project. Participating farmers were similar to the average goat farmers in the region in terms of land size (0. 86 ha) and quality, and labour force available on the <b>farm</b> (<b>labour</b> <b>force</b> unit). The flock size was unchanged (6 heads), but its composition showed {{an increase in the}} proportion of Alpine crossbreds in participating farmers' flocks with a decline in the proportion of Small East African goats. Involvement in the crossbreeding programme was associated with differences in the cropping system (more fodder crops, maize and patatoes). With the adoption of the promoted practices, the livestock system required more labour and appeared to substitute off-farm employment for the head of household, indirectly indicating the profitability of farming dual=purpose goats. The project effectively adressed representative farmers, but was modifying the farming system far beyond the goat component.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, the dairy {{industry}} {{has grown in}} land area, number of cows, milk production and dairy exports {{to the point where}} it is New Zealand’s premier exporter. Growth has been accompanied by significant structural changes to the industry. In particular, many small, family owned and managed farms, that were characterised by high levels of self employment, have been replaced by large scale ‘factory’ style, irrigated farms that depend on non family, often casualized and seasonal workers, who work very long hours. Staffing these farms has been problematic and recruitment and retention have been regularly highlighted issues. Such issues have cast doubt on the social sustainability of the dairy industry. The future of the dairy industry to a large degree depends on its people. Many of these people are now migrants, who have become ‘essential’ because traditional sources of labour are inadequate. Does a dependence on migrant workers jeopardise the future stability and sustainability of dairy production? Can all stakeholders in the industry benefit from migratory staff in such a way that all parties achieve a winning outcome, as for the horticultural Recognised Seasonal Employer Scheme. A profound change in the dairy industry may be necessary to ensure that stakeholders make the effort necessary to negotiate such a multi win outcome, which might provide a lasting rather than a temporary solution.

5|$|Farm incomes {{have fallen}} {{over the years}} as a result of cheap food {{policies}} in the United Kingdom, the lowering of world commodity prices and the removal of production-based subsidies. Particularly hard hit have been the incomes of hill farms in Wales which averaged £15,000 in 2014, as against £23,000 for lowland livestock farms and £59,000 for dairy <b>farms.</b> The <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> has been dwindling for many years as a result of increased mechanisation and changes in farming practices. Fewer farmers are needed today because they are able to produce more food from their land. Hay is no longer the main source of winter feed for livestock and has largely been replaced by silage, particularly baled silage wrapped in film that can be handled mechanically. This has reduced the manpower needed on farms, and there has been an increase of use by farmers of specialised contractors who provide services in silage making, harvesting and fencing. Another problem facing Welsh farmers is their distance from the main distribution centres used by supermarkets which are mostly located near centres of population in England.|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of this report {{examines}} some changes in New Zealand rural population since 1881 and more recent demographic characteristics. It shows that during the twentieth century, the proportion of people living in rural areas has dramatically decreased. The rural population has kept some distinctive characteristics and it differs from the urban population notably by having a higher proportion of children and a lower proportion of young adults and elderly people. Employment opportunities in urban areas and better availability of care facilities for older people can be considered as the main factors attracting people in these age categories away from rural areas. It has to be noted that at the same time, rural areas are also attracting important numbers of new inhabitants, which can probably be explained by the growing popularity of lifestyle blocks. The second part of the report concerns farm labour change. While the absolute numbers of agriculture and fishery workers in New Zealand have not followed an overall trend of decrease, their proportion in total labour force has been falling over the last decades. The profile of agricultural workers has also undergone changes, with notably an increase in highly qualified workers and a decrease in the numbers of workers with no qualification. Just like in the national population, changes have been observed as well in the ethnic composition of the <b>farm</b> <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> over time. To conclude, some elements concerning the labour market dynamics are examined. These show that the agricultural sector has the highest worker turnover rate, while the average hourly earnings in this industry remain less than the average in the total population...|$|E
40|$|Cet article traite des {{exclusions}} légales et sociales qui affectent la main-d’œuvre agricole saisonnière véhiculée quotidiennement au Québec, dont la grande majorité sont des immigrants résidant à Montréal. Une recherche sociale sur le terrain a révélé, sur certaines fermes, un haut roulement de main-d’œuvre et des conditions de travail en deçà du seuil légalement et humainement admissible : non-respect des personnes, du temps de travail, des normes de santé et sécurité, discrimination. À partir des résultats de cette étude, de recherches sur les modifications de l'agriculture québécoise au XXe siècle ainsi que de l'analyse de contenu de mémoires de l'Union des producteurs agricoles (UPA), les auteures mettent en lumière le rôle de l'UPA dans les exclusions légales successives des salariés agricoles et remettent en question son discours sur la pénurie de main-d’œuvre, contredite par la recherche. This {{article examines}} the situation of seasonal farm workers in Quebec, the majority of whom are immigrants living in Montreal. These workers are employed on a casual and on-call basis and are transported to their work on a dally basis. Drawing {{on the results of}} a recent fieldwork study, on historical studies of the changes in Quebec agriculture in the 20 th century and on a content analysis of several briefs by the Union des producteurs agricoles (UPA - the Quebec Farmers' Union), the authors attempt to determine the legal and social exclusions affecting this particular labour force. The paper first describes how, during the last twenty years, the expansion of the agricultural sector {{in the context of a}} decrease in the number of family workers and increase in hired farm help, has affected the profile of agricultural manpower in Quebec. In certain sectors requiring training (e. g., dairy, pork), hired labour has remained infrequent, whereas in the horticultural sector, which hires unskilled workers for harvesting, there has been a large increase in the number of hired workers. These changes explain why agricultural producers in the horticultural sector now hire immigrant farm workers who are residents of Montreal. The study indicates that seasonal agricultural workers transported on a dally basis make up a significant part of the hired <b>farm</b> <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> in Quebec and that these workers are employed on farms that employ tens, and even hundreds of workers during harvest time. The results of the fieldwork study are then presented, with a focus on the contrast between the principal labour standards and occupational health and safety legislation that applies to farm workers, and the actual working conditions revealed in the study. The research revealed high labour turnover and particularly difficult working conditions, although these vary greatly between farms. These include low wages, fallure to observe regulations concerning working time, unhealthy conditions, little concern for worker safety, humiliating attitudes and language, and discrimination. The study thus reveals that labour shortage problems, which have been decried by the UPA, in fact conceal poor working conditions. Finally, the authors challenge the UPA's backward-looking discourse, which has not changed despite the socio-economic transformations discussed in the article. The UPA bases its arguments on two interrelated postulates: (1) that agriculture is a specialsector due to its distinctive nature as compared with other economic sectors; and (2) that the model of relations is familial,since it is based on the producer's family. The organization has relied on these arguments to demand, and in large part to obtain, the exclusion of agricultural workers from the scope of the Act respecting Labour Standards,claiming that farmers already respect the Act's provisions. The Commission des droits de la personne(Quebec Human Rights Commission), which opposed the exclusion during consultations on the draft legislation (in 1979, and again in 1990 when the law was amended), has maintained that such an exclusion results in adverse-effect discrimination based on social condition and ethnie origin. However, the legislative provision excluding agricultural workers has not yet given rise to a legal challenge based on the Quebec Charter of Rights and Human Freedoms. In the authors' view, the legal route holds out little promise for improving the employaient situation of these workers, given the precarious nature of this poor and vulnerable labour force, which is generally made up of recent immigrants. However, the authors propose some other possible solutions: first of all, amendments to both federal and Quebec labour law, which traditionally exclude agricultural workers; and secondly, changes of a political nature that would allow these workers to join together and to create an independent monitoring organization. These steps are a necessary precondition to achieving the more profound change that is needed at the humanitarian level to put a stop to the attacks on the human dignity of these seasonal agricultural workers who are transported to their work on a dally basis.

Most authors primarily regard this problem throuhgh changes in the basic characteristics of the agricultural population and the <b>labour</b> <b>force,</b> considering factors like the size of the agricultural population, the natural population increase, sex and age structure and the like, whereas the quantification of real employment and the balance of the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> is analyzed as a "statical form of evaluation" (the number of farmers, i. e. work -active persons, per unit area).

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{examines}} the supply and utilisation of labour resources among farmers in Ikwuano-Umuahia Local Government Area of Abia State. A total of 175 small scale farmers {{were randomly selected}} and interviewed {{with the use of}} structured questionnaires in five out of the nine autonomous communities that make up the local government area. The data collected were analysed and the results showed that average family <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> of 200 man days was not enough to cultivate the average farm size of 2. 158 hectares. Labour shortage exists. Farmers are making up for this shortage by using communal and hired labour. Each farmer uses on the average 48. 0 mandays of communal labour and 222. 24 mandays of hired labour in order to cultivate the average farm size. Shortage of <b>farm</b> <b>labour</b> was found to be due to increasing rate of migration of rural <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> to the urban centres, non-farm employment, non-availability of saving technologies e. g. fertilizers etc [...] A labour demand function was estimated against the following independent variables: Wage rate, farm size,cost of capital, cost of other inputs, family labour in mandays, communal labour and hired labour in mandays.
