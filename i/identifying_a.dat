5|$|In most patients, {{the direct}} {{cause for the}} {{cerebral}} sinus thrombosis is not readily apparent. <b>Identifying</b> <b>a</b> source of infection is crucial; it is common practice to screen for various forms of thrombophilia (a propensity to form blood clots).|$|E

5|$|A URL is a URI that, in {{addition}} to <b>identifying</b> <b>a</b> web resource, specifies the means of acting upon or obtaining the representation of it, i.e. specifying both its primary access mechanism and network location. For example, the URL http://example.org/wiki/Main_Page refers to a resource identified as /wiki/Main_Page whose representation, {{in the form of}} HTML and related code, is obtainable via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (http:) from a network host whose domain name is example.org.|$|E
5|$|Tacitus' {{narrative}} emphasizes {{both political}} and psychological motivation. The characterisation of Tiberius throughout the first six books is mostly negative, and gradually worsens as his rule declines, <b>identifying</b> <b>a</b> clear breaking point {{with the death of}} his son Drusus in 23 AD.|$|E
5|$|A few early sets {{experimented with}} {{alternate}} art for cards. However, Wizards {{came to believe}} that this impeded easy recognition of a card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when <b>identifying</b> <b>a</b> card at a glance. Consequently, alternate art is now only used sparingly and mostly for promotional cards. When older cards are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed that they will be printed with new art to make the older cards more collectible.|$|E

50|$|A {{telephone}} number prefix (1+6 digits) normally suffices to uniquely <b>identify</b> <b>a</b> rate center; if number pooling and local number portability {{were not in}} use, it would also uniquely <b>identify</b> <b>a</b> wire center.|$|R
5|$|Herdwick lambs {{are born}} black, {{and after a}} year they lighten to a dark brown colour (the sheep are called hoggs or hoggets at this stage). After the first shearing, their fleece lightens further to grey. Rams are horned, and ewes polled. For shows and auctions, Herdwicks {{traditionally}} have their wool ruddied up (the local term for raddled) with dye. Rams are also ruddied when put out with the ewes to show which have been mated, and the dye is also one method (called a smit) of marking sheep for ownership. Before chemical dyes became available, this dye was made from either iron ore or graphite mixed with grease. For many years the legal method of <b>identifying</b> <b>a</b> particular shepherd's sheep were notches cut out of a sheep's ear, called lug marks—now replaced by ear tags.|$|E
5|$|Playa de Oro {{virus was}} first {{identified}} in rodents collected in 2004 {{as part of}} a survey of wild mammals at Playa de Oro in Manzanillo, Colima, western Mexico. The discovery was published in 2008 by Yong-Kyu Chu and colleagues. Among 600 small mammals, antibodies against the hantavirus Sin Nombre virus were found in 23 individuals (out of 358 studied) of Oryzomys couesi, a rice rat that was the most common species found, six (out of 87) of the cotton rat Sigmodon mascotensis, and one (out of 77) of the pygmy mouse Baiomys musculus. In addition, twelve O.couesi and one S.mascotensis yielded hantavirus RNA. Viruses were found in males more often than in females. Because the amino acid sequences in sequenced parts of the virus's genome differed by as much as 7 to 10% from closely related hantaviruses, Chu and colleagues identified the virus found at Playa de Oro as a new species, called Playa de Oro virus or OROV. Although the authors could not prove that the virus fulfilled all the criteria for <b>identifying</b> <b>a</b> new virus species, they argued that it was likely that it did fulfill those criteria. It is currently treated as a probable species in the Hantavirus genus.|$|E

5000|$|Conceptually, an Internet {{addresses}} {{consists of}} a netid and a hostid. The netid <b>identifies</b> <b>a</b> network and the hostid <b>identifies</b> <b>a</b> host. The term host is misleading in that an individual computer can have multiple network interfaces each having its own Internet address. An Internet Address <b>identifies</b> <b>a</b> connection to the network, not an individual computer. The netid is used by routers to decide where to send a packet.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> {{response}} that <b>identifies</b> <b>a</b> card that {{need not be}} inverted, or that fails to <b>identify</b> <b>a</b> card {{that needs to be}} inverted, is incorrect. The original task dealt with numbers (even, odd) and letters (vowels, consonants).|$|R
40|$|An {{imaging system}} for {{identifying}} {{the location of}} the center of mass (COM) in an image. In one aspect, an imaging system includes a plurality of photosensitive elements arranged in a matrix. A center of mass circuit coupled to the photosensitive elements includes a resistive network and a normalization circuit including at least one bipolar transistor. The center of mass circuit <b>identifies</b> <b>a</b> center of mass location in the matrix and includes: a row circuit, where the row circuit <b>identifies</b> <b>a</b> center of mass row value in each row of the matrix and <b>identifies</b> <b>a</b> row intensity for each row; a horizontal circuit, where the horizontal circuit <b>identifies</b> <b>a</b> center of mass horizontal value; and a vertical circuit, where the vertical circuit <b>identifies</b> <b>a</b> center of mass vertical value. The horizontal and vertical center of mass values indicate the coordinates of the center of mass location for the image...|$|R
25|$|To {{identify}} their territories, male tigers mark trees by spraying urine and anal gland secretions, {{as well as}} marking trails with scat. Males show a grimacing face, called the Flehmen response, when <b>identifying</b> <b>a</b> female's reproductive condition by sniffing their urine markings.|$|E
25|$|When a linga is identified, {{there are}} three possibilities; the sign may be present in all, some or none of the sapakṣas or vipakṣas. <b>Identifying</b> <b>a</b> sign assumes that it {{is present in the}} pakṣa, and the first {{condition}} is met. Dignaga combined these in his Hetucakra.|$|E
25|$|These steps go {{far beyond}} the simple task of <b>identifying</b> <b>a</b> small number of {{financial}} and non-financial measures, but illustrate the requirement for whatever design process is used to fit within broader thinking about how the resulting balanced scorecard will integrate with the wider business management process.|$|E

25|$|Hilbert's axioms: Hilbert's axioms had {{the goal}} of <b>identifying</b> <b>a</b> simple and {{complete}} set of independent axioms from which the most important geometric theorems could be deduced. The outstanding objectives were to make Euclidean geometry rigorous (avoiding hidden assumptions) and to make clear the ramifications of the parallel postulate.|$|E
25|$|Units of the Second AIF prefixed {{their numbers}} with a '2/' (pronounced 'second') to {{distinguish}} themselves from Militia units. Where such a unit {{did not exist}} in the First AIF or the Militia, the '2/' was not initially used, but later it was generally adopted as <b>identifying</b> <b>a</b> unit of the Second AIF.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC)-end {{sequencing}} (end-sequence profiling): Identifies chromosomal breakpoints by {{generating a}} BAC library from a cancer genome and sequencing their ends.

25|$|Common descent {{describes}} how, {{in evolutionary}} biology, {{a group of}} organisms share a most recent common ancestor.

25|$|The {{only one}} of the late 1st/early 2nd Century Apostolic Fathers to use the term is Polycarp (c. 69 – c. 155) who warned the Philippians that {{everyone}} who preached false doctrine was an antichrist. His use of the term Antichrist follows that of the New Testament in not <b>identifying</b> <b>a</b> single personal Antichrist, but a class of people.|$|E
