40|$|An {{association}} was demonstrated recently between elevated in vitro production of interferon (IFN) ±g by intervillous blood mononuclear cells (IVBMCs) and protection against placental malaria (PM). Because human immunode®ciency virus (HIV) ±infected pregnant women have increased susceptibility to PM, {{loss of the}} IFN-g response in these women may impair their ability to control PM. Measurement of cytokines in culture supernatants by ELISA revealed that IFN-g responses by HIV-positive IVBMCs were impaired, especially after malarial an-tigen stimulation. Interleukin (IL) ± 4 and IL- 10 responses also were reduced in <b>HIV-positive</b> <b>persons,</b> the latter more so in <b>HIV-positive,</b> PM-positive <b>persons.</b> In contrast, tumor necrosis factor±a production generally was enhanced in PM-positive and <b>HIV-positive</b> <b>persons.</b> Over-all, cytokine production was reduced in <b>HIV-positive</b> <b>persons</b> with CD 4 T cell counts! 500 / mL, particularly in response to malarial antigen. Thus, HIV-mediated cytokine dysregulation and impairment of the protective IFN-g response {{may contribute to the}} increased susceptibility of HIV-positive pregnant women to malaria.

50|$|More recently, Blankson has led {{investigations}} of elite suppressors of HIV-1 infection. Elite suppressors {{are people who}} are infected with HIV-1 but naturally suppress the amount of virus in their blood to very low, almost undetectable levels without use of antiretroviral drugs. Only 1 <b>HIV-positive</b> <b>person</b> out of approximately 300 is in this category. Blankson and other investigators suggest the biological mechanisms of this rare phenomenon may hold the key to new treatments for HIV.

We determined the prevalence of and risk factors for hyperlactatemia in <b>HIV-positive</b> <b>persons</b> to assess the relevance of lactate venous blood concentrations during antiretroviral therapy. Methods: We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study of venous lactate determinations with 282 consecutive <b>HIV-positive</b> <b>persons</b> who, in addition to a physical examination, had blood samples taken every 3 – 4 months for routine biochemical, immunologic, and viral assessment. The frequencies of hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis were determined, and the risk factors were analyzed by a multivariate logistic regression model.

40|$|Mortality {{rates for}} those {{infected}} with human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) have decreased substantially {{in recent years}} as a result of improved medical effectiveness (Jensen-Fangel et al., 2004; Keiser et al., 2004; Mocroft et al., 2003; Van Sighem et al., 2005). Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has transformed HIV from a terminal to a chronic disease (Lohse et al., 2007), this transformation has not changed the way the public views the disease (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, 2007). The fact that HIV remains a highly stigmatized disease throughout the world (Herek, Capitanio, & Widaman, 2002) is also significant in Denmark (Danish AIDS Foundation, 2009). Although overt expressions of HIV-related stigma have declined during the past decade, nearly one in four Danes remain fearful of having direct contact with an HIV-positive person; every 5 th <b>HIV-positive</b> <b>person</b> has told two or fewer people that they are infected; and every 3 rd <b>HIV-positive</b> <b>person</b> is afraid that their HIV status will become known in their social circle (Carstensen & Dahl, 2008; Danish AIDS Foundation).

40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo {{retrospectively}} {{determine the}} prevalence of anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) antibody in <b>HIV-positive</b> <b>persons</b> with different routes of HIV exposure and to describe its characteristics in order to guide vaccination policy. MethodsThe prevalence of anti-HAV antibody was compared between 1580 <b>HIV-positive</b> <b>persons</b> seeking medical attention and 2581 HIV-negative controls seeking health check-ups, who had undergone anti-HAV tests between 2004 and 2007. Comparisons were also made among groups of the HIV-positive patients who had acquired HIV via different routes of transmission. A multivariate logistic regression model was built to identify independent variables associated with anti-HAV seropositivity. ResultsThe overall prevalence of anti-HAV antibody was 60. 9 % in the HIV-positive and 48. 0 % in the controls (p< 0. 001). The overall adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for positive anti-HAV antibody was 2. 604 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 106 – 3. 219) in <b>HIV-positive</b> <b>persons</b> compared with HIV-negative <b>persons.</b> In addition, <b>HIV-positive</b> {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM), heterosexuals, and injecting drug users (IDU) all had significantly higher AOR for positive anti-HAV antibody than HIV-negative <b>persons.</b> In <b>HIV-positive</b> <b>persons,</b> older age (AOR 1. 284, 95 % CI 1. 246 – 1. 322) and IDU (AOR 5. 137, 95 % CI 3. 499 – 7. 542) were independently associated with an increased prevalence of anti-HAV antibody. Nearly 90 % of the IDU had become seropositive for HAV after age 36 – 40 years, compared with heterosexuals and MSM after age 46 – 50 years, and controls after age 51 – 55 years.

40|$|Abstract: The {{construction}} of disease risks as knowable, calculable and preventable in dominant social science {{and public health}} discourses has fostered {{a certain kind of}} logic about individual risk and the responsibility for infection. Disease control measures that have developed out of this logic typically fail to recognise the socio-structural roots of many high-risk behaviours that are linked to the spread of infection. Instead, they hold the disease carrier responsible for managing his/her own risk of infection of others, and rely on constraining the agency of the carrier (e. g. by constraining movement, contact or occupation). In occupations associated with a high risk of infection, the idea of responsibility of the actor implicitly raises issues of ‘‘professional responsibility’’. Using the case of ‘‘Typhoid Mary’ ’ and a hypothetical case of ‘‘HIV Jane’’, this paper explores some of the problems with making sex workers responsible for the prevention of HIV transmission. It argues that for the notion of ‘‘responsibility’ ’ to make any sense, the <b>HIV-positive</b> <b>person</b> must {{be in a position to}} exercise responsibility, and for this they must have agency...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of review: When {{should people}} with HIV start treatment? This {{question}} is widely debated. The recent momentum to initiate treatment at a CD 4 cell count above 350  cells/mm 3 {{is driven by}} the potential population benefits of antiretroviral treatment reducing infectiousness together with operational concerns. These are important. However, we focus on the clinical benefits and risks for the person taking treatment, and how this may vary depending on the background health setting. Recent findings: We refer to the recent guideline changes and the limited evidence on which they are based. Many studies that have informed guideline changes reference plausible benefits, but have limited follow-up and are not designed to assess the potential risks. We note historical examples to show that expert opinion in the absence of data warrants caution. Summary: Results from well powered studies designed to look at the question of when to start treatment are essential for quantifying the benefits and risks of earlier treatment. Meanwhile, the decision of when to start must be taken by the <b>HIV-positive</b> <b>person</b> in consultation with their health worker based on accurate information. That choice will vary depending on a person's individual health, their reason to want to treat and the resources of the health-care facility...|$|E

Background. <b>HIV-positive</b> <b>persons</b> have increased rates of coronary artery disease (CAD). The relative contribution of genetic background, HIV-related factors, antiretroviral medications, and traditional risk factors to CAD has not been fully evaluated {{in the setting of}} HIV infection. Methods. In the general population, 23 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were shown to be associated with CAD through genome-wide association analysis. Using the metabochip, we genotyped 1875 HIV-positive, white individuals enrolled in 24 HIV observational studies, including 571 participants with a first CAD event during the 9 -year study period and 1304 controls matched on gender and cohort. Results. A genetic risk score built from 23 CAD-associated SNPs contributed significantly to CAD (P= 2. 9 x 10 - 4). In the final, multivariable model, participants with an unfavorable genetic background (top genetic score quartile) had a CAD odds ratio (OR) of 1. 47 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 05 - 2. 04).

Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii are pathogenic yeasts that may cause meningoencephalitis. C. neoformans primarily infects immunocompromised patients and occurs worldwide, whereas C. gattii primarily mainly infects otherwise healthy persons and has been thought to occur in subtropical regions (1 – 3). However, the recent outbreak of infection with C. gattii on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada (4), expansion of this outbreak to mainland Canada and the Pacific Northwest region of the United States (5), and identification of C. gattii isolates in Europe (6) show that C. gattii can also occur in temperate climates. Molecular techniques can distinguish 7 haploid genotypic groups within C. neoformans and C. gattii (7 – 9; F. Hagen and T. Boekhout, unpub. data).

40|$|HIV {{disclosure}} is {{a complex}} phenomenon. The choice of disclosure or non-disclosure {{is a reflection of}} how each <b>HIV-positive</b> <b>person</b> experiences and deals with HIV/ AIDS in their everyday life. In this study, we qualitatively explore the experiences of disclosing HIV status to family members and children among HIV-positive women living in Thailand. Due to fear of stigma and discrimination, the women decided to tell only a few people, usually their sig-nificant others including parents and children. Although most women received good support from their family members, some were rejected and discriminated against by their family members. This stems from lack of knowledge about HIV/AIDS among family members. Women found disclosure to their children a difficult decision to make. Only some women told their children about their HIV status. They wished to protect their children from emotional burden. This protection also appeared in their attempts to prepare their children for dealing with HIV/AIDS. Support from family members {{played a major role in}} the lives of HIV-positive women. Although disclosure has been pro-moted as a means of ending stigma and discrimination, our data suggested that disclosure may not be positive for some women. This has implications for health promotion in HIV health care. Healthcare providers need to appreciate the ramifications of promoting disclosure to HIV-positive women who are mothers.

Methods included Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and time-varying Cox regression models. Of 2, 137 HIV-seronegative IDUs at enrollment, 148 became HIV-positive within 4 years (incidence: 3. 3 cases/ 100 person-years; 95 % confidence interval: 2. 8, 3. 9). An annual HIV incidence decline of 0. 06 cases/ 100 person-years prior to 2000 was followed by a more rapid annual decline of 0. 24 cases/ 100 person-years during and after 2000. Behavioral trends included increasing cocaine and heroin use and decreasing proportions of IDUs reporting any syringe-sharing or sharing a syringe with an <b>HIV-positive</b> <b>person.</b> In multivariate analyses, HIV seroconversion was associated with male gender, unstable housing, intravenous cocaine use, and sharing syringes or having sex with an HIV-positive partner. Always acquiring syringes from safe sources conferred a reduced risk of HIV acquisition among participants recruited after 2004, but this association was not statistically significant for participants recruited earlier. In conclusion, HIV incidence has declined in this cohort, with an acceleration of the reduction in HIV transmission after 2000. ...|$|E

To this end, in 2006, we conducted a cross-sectional study involving clinical centers in five Italian cities. Each center was asked to enroll 100 persons aged 18 years or older who had a diagnosis of HIV infection that dated back at least 2 years. Data were collected with a specifically designed questionnaire, administered during a structured interview. The McNemar chi(2) test was used to compare the data before and after the diagnosis. A total of 497 persons participated (65. 5 % males; median age of 40 years; age range, 34 - 45 years). The most common exposure categories were: heterosexual contact (43. 4 %), homosexual contact (27. 2 %), and injecting drug use (20. 6 %).
