25|$|Some LCDs mimic needle tuners with {{a needle}} graphic that moves {{in the same way}} as a genuine needle tuner. Somewhat misleadingly, many LED {{displays}} have a 'strobe mode' that mimics strobe tuners by scrolling the flashing of the LEDs cyclically to simulate the display of a true strobe. However, these are all just <b>display</b> <b>options.</b> The way a regular tuner 'hears' and compares the input note to a desired pitch is exactly the same, with no change in accuracy. For more on how strobe tuners work see the dedicated section.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{adventure}} {{games have}} been presented as interactive movies; these are games {{where most of the}} graphics are either fully pre-rendered or use full motion video from live actors on a set, stored on a media that allows fast random access such as laserdisc or CD-ROM. The arcade versions of Dragon's Lair and Space Ace are canonical examples of such works. The game's software would present a scene and then <b>display</b> <b>options</b> for the player to continue on, the choice leading to the game playing a new scene from the media. The video may be augmented by additional computer graphics; Under a Killing Moon used a combination of full motion video and 3D graphics. Because these games are limited by what has been pre-rendered or recorded, {{there is a lack of}} player interactivity in these titles, with wrong choices or decisions leading quickly to an ending scene.|$|E

2500|$|The F-15E {{prototype}} was {{a modification}} of the two-seat F-15B. The F-15E, despite its origins, includes significant structural changes and much more powerful engines. The aft fuselage was designed to incorporate the more powerful engines with advanced engine bay structures and doors. [...] The advanced structures utilized Superplastic forming and diffusion bonding (SPF/DB) technologies. [...] The back seat is equipped for a weapon systems officer (WSO pronounced 'wizzo') to work the new air-to-ground avionics. The WSO uses multiple screens to display information from the radar, electronic warfare, or Thermographic cameras, monitor aircraft or weapons status and possible threats, select targets, and use an electronic moving map to navigate. Two hand controls are used to select new displays and to refine targeting information. Displays can be moved from one screen to another, chosen from a menu of <b>display</b> <b>options.</b> Unlike earlier two-place jets (e.g. the F-14 Tomcat and Navy variants of the F-4), whose back seat lacked flying controls, {{the back seat of}} the F-15E cockpit is equipped with its own stick and throttle so the WSO can take over flying, albeit with reduced visibility.|$|E
