5|$|Gunnerkrigg Court {{is set in}} a {{boarding}} school in a country that resembles the United Kingdom, identifiable from the <b>grey</b> <b>skies</b> and mandatory uniforms. The comic contains other clues about the setting, such as the house system that is described {{at the end of the}} first chapter. This system is similar to that used by many UK schools, including the one the author attended; Siddell has even stated that the school in which Gunnerkrigg Court takes place is modeled after his own secondary school.|$|E
5|$|The group come {{together}} for a dance routine on a rooftop with a backdrop of dark <b>grey</b> <b>skies</b> and strikes of lightning. All four group members are also seen pacing through a dark city wearing figure hugging outfits. The video {{draws to a close}} when the man who the group have built an unhealthy fixation to is seen tied to a chair as the group walks towards him, before the words 'To Be Continued' appear on the screen. In an interview with Owen Myers of Popjustice, Jesy Nelson said the music video will be continued on their 2013 DNA Tour.|$|E
25|$|The {{return to}} London in October was a letdown. The <b>grey</b> <b>skies</b> and bad food {{compared}} unfavorably with his recent retreat, {{and he was}} suffering from digestive problems (these recurred throughout much of his later life), though it was also good to be home. But he already had plans to return to Paris.|$|E

500|$|Stage 6 was a [...] route {{starting}} {{at the headquarters of}} Oman Air on the edge of Muscat International Airport. The route first followed the coast west, before turning inland and heading east. The race crossed two classified climbs on the edge of Muscat, before finishing on the corniche at Muttrah with three laps of a finishing circuit. The weather conditions were much more suitable for racing, with <b>grey</b> <b>skies</b> and the temperature approximately [...] lower than the previous day.|$|E
500|$|The album's climax {{is found}} in the title track, {{described}} by the artist as [...] "a personal breakthrough" [...] and is initially born out of a <b>Grey</b> <b>Skies</b> demo, [...] "Soft," [...] previously released on Ass-Sordid Demos II. [...] "Ki" [...] builds into a cyclical progression of arpeggios which Martin Popoff of Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles described as the album's [...] "proggiest" [...] moment. It leads into [...] "Quiet Riot", an acoustic version of [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize" [...] with new lyrics. [...] "Quiet Riot", Townsend explained, [...] "basically sums up the idea that, although I am 'damaged,' I'm fine, and have chosen to make my life better." ...|$|E
500|$|The race {{began in}} Bergamo with <b>grey</b> <b>skies</b> and rain falling. The race {{began with a}} {{succession}} of attacks; eventually an eleven-rider group escaped to form the day's principal breakaway. These were Stefan Schumacher (...) , Enrico Barbin (...) , Jan Polanc (Lampre-Merida), Matteo Busato (...) , Dennis van Winden (LottoNL-Jumbo), Simon Geschke (Giant-Alpecin), Pierpaolo De Negri (Nippo-Vini Fantini), Marco Canola (...) , Cesare Benedetti (Bora-Argon 18), Jérôme Coppel (...) and Oscar Gatto (...) [...] The break had a lead that extended to over eight minutes after the Colle Brianza, while the peloton was controlled principally by Astana, with some assistance from Movistar and Team Sky. By {{the foot of the}} Madonna del Ghisallo, the lead had been cut to just two and a half minutes.|$|E

500|$|Devin Townsend {{was born}} in New Westminster, British Columbia, on May 5, 1972. Townsend picked up the banjo when he was five, and began playing guitar when he was 12. As an early {{teenager}} he befriended Brian [...] "Beav" [...] Waddell, who would later play guitars {{as part of the}} Devin Townsend Band and bass on the Devin Townsend Project. He participated in several metal bands while he was in high school, and founded <b>Grey</b> <b>Skies</b> at the age of 19. Around the same time he joined a popular local group called Caustic Thought, replacing Jed Simon on guitar and playing alongside bassist Byron Stroud, both of whom would later become members of Townsend's flagship band, Strapping Young Lad. In 1993, Townsend began writing material under the name Noisescapes, a project he later described as [...] "just as violent as Strapping Young Lad".|$|E
500|$|Melinda Houston, {{writing for}} The Age, called Sense and Sensibility [...] "a {{gorgeous}} adaptation {{of her most}} frivolous work" [...] and added, [...] "It's all beautifully made, beautifully cast, and the script snaps and crackles. Maybe Eleanor isn't quite as flawed as originally drawn but that's unlikely to detract from your enjoyment." [...] Lenny Ann Low from The Sydney Morning Herald stated, [...] "The locations, costumes and acting are excellent, with a particularly striking use of light – cold and <b>grey</b> <b>skies</b> foretelling doom through to rich candlelight signalling new passions." [...] The New York Times critic Ginia Bellafante said, [...] "There's nothing glaringly wrong with this new Sense and Sensibility, the last in Masterpiece's winter-long homage to Austen; it is both lush and tidy. But it alters the emotional chemistry, {{and the result is}} an adaptation that feels more arid than Mr. Lee's effort." ...|$|E
2500|$|Daily {{temperatures}} oscillate between lows of [...] to [...] and highs of [...] to [...] Occasional coastal fogs on some {{mornings and}} high clouds in some afternoons and evenings can be present. Summer sunsets are colorful, labeled by locals as [...] "cielo de brujas" [...] (Spanish for [...] "sky of witches"), since the sky commonly turns shades of orange, pink and red around 7 pm. Winter weather is dramatically different. <b>Grey</b> <b>skies,</b> breezy conditions, higher humidity and cooler temperatures prevail. Long (1-week or more) stretches of dark overcast skies are not uncommon. Persistent morning drizzle occurs occasionally from June through September, coating {{the streets with}} {{a thin layer of}} water that generally dries up by early afternoon. Winter temperatures vary little between day and night. They range from lows of [...] to [...] and highs of [...] to , rarely exceeding [...] except in the easternmost districts.|$|E

2500|$|Amanda Dobbins of New York {{magazine}} {{concluded that}} [...] "the secretly devastating video" [...] for [...] "Someone like You" [...] will remind Adele's ex-lover {{what he has}} done by leaving her. A writer of The Huffington Post praised the simplicity and the sadness in the video. Sarah Dean of the same publication called it an [...] "uncomplicated, moving film" [...] and wrote, [...] "the video is nothing more than Adele wandering around the deserted city of love alone, under its <b>grey</b> <b>skies,</b> singing her sorrowful notes, but because it's her, we don't need any more." [...] That was somehow echoed by Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine who said that the video was [...] "simply constructed as the song's vocal-and-piano arrangement." [...] Marc Hogan of Spin said that the scene in which Adele looks in the camera, [...] "speak for itself" [...] about the sadness in the video. Andrew Matson of The Seattle Times said, [...] "the song of the year now has a simple, perfect video: Adele in Paris, singing and strolling, apparently processing the breakup detailed in the song's lyrics. The look on her face during the 'I wish nothing but the best for you' line is the best, just gutting, a real achievement how she plays it cold but not sarcastic. I think in times of emotional devastation, everyone wants stand on a bridge over the Seine on a cold day, squinting into the wind, sorting it out." ...|$|E

6000|$|This is {{a perfect}} {{realisation}} of that eerie sentiment which comes upon us, not so often among mountains and water-falls, as it does on some half-starved common at twilight, or in walking down some grey mean street. It is {{the song of the}} beauty of refuse; and Browning was the first to sing it. Oddly enough it {{has been one of the}} poems about which most of those pedantic and trivial questions have been asked, which are asked invariably by those who treat Browning as a science instead of a poet, [...] "What does the poem of 'Childe Roland' mean?" [...] The only genuine answer to this is, [...] "What does anything mean?" [...] Does the earth mean nothing? Do <b>grey</b> <b>skies</b> and wastes covered with thistles mean nothing? Does an old horse turned out to graze mean nothing? If it does, there is but one further truth to be added--that everything means nothing.|$|E
