25|$|Polo saddles are English-style, close contact, {{similar to}} jumping saddles; {{although}} most polo saddles lack a flap under the billets. Some players {{will not use}} a saddle blanket. The saddle has a flat seat and no knee support; the rider adopting a forward-leaning seat and closed knees dissimilar to a classical dressage seat. A breastplate is added, usually attached to the front billet. A standing martingale must be used: so, a breastplate is a necessity for safety. The tie-down is usually supported by a neck strap. Many saddles also have an overgirth. The stirrup irons are heavier than most, and the stirrup leathers are wider and thicker, for added safety when the player stands in the stirrups. The legs of the pony are wrapped with polo wraps from below the knee to the fetlock to minimize pain. Jumping (open front) or gallop boots are sometimes used along with the polo wraps for added protection. Often, these wraps match the team colours. The pony's mane is most often roached (<b>hogged),</b> and its tail is docked or braided {{so that it will}} not snag the rider's mallet.|$|E

Batting first, they had been worried by the opponents' captain Ben Hutton, who took three for 42, including top-scorer Ronnie Irani, as Essex were 118 for 6 at one point. The Dutch international Ryan ten Doeschate made 44 off 37 balls, with four fours, and played a major part in getting the Essex total to 202 for 8. Middlesex' top-order were taken out by Essex' bowlers, as only Paul Weekes passed 20 from the top seven, while Ed Smith and Ed Joyce both recorded ducks. At 102 for 6, and with skipper Hutton gone for 2, Middlesex still needed 101 runs with only four wickets in hand, but a patient 71-run partnership between Weekes and Ben Scott left Middlesex to hit 31 runs {{for the last three}} wickets when Weekes was lbw to Danish Kaneria. Scott <b>hogged</b> the strike, but couldn't get the necessary boundaries, and Middlesex finished their 45 overs on 198 for 9, five runs short of a victory that would have put them level on points with Essex.|$|E

40|$|The lean <b>hog</b> futures {{contract}} is replacing the live <b>hog</b> {{futures contract}} at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange {{beginning with the}} February 1997 contract. The lean <b>hog</b> futures will be cash settled based on a broad-based lean <b>hog</b> price index, eliminating terminal markets from the price discovery process.

Frozen pork bellies futures are also examined for the cash meats. Both long- term and short-term hedges are simulated, using the minimum- variance approach, which utilizes only unconditional information, and the Myers-Thompson approach that incorporates conditional information. The results show that the lean <b>hog</b> futures should perform better than either the live <b>hog</b> or the frozen pork bellies futures as a hedging instrument for Omaha cash <b>hogs</b> and cash loins.

40|$|In {{response}} {{to increases in}} extracellular osmolarity, Saccharomyces cerevisiae activates the <b>HOG</b> 1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which is composed {{of a pair of}} redundant MAPK kinase kinases, namely, Ssk 2 p and Ssk 22 p, the MAPK kinase Pbs 2 p, and the MAPK <b>Hog</b> 1 p. <b>Hog</b> 1 p is activated by Pbs 2 p through phosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine residues. Activated <b>Hog</b> 1 p is essential for survival of yeast cells at high osmolarity. However, expression of constitutively active mutant kinases, such as those encoded by SSK 2 deltaN and PBS 2 (DD), is toxic and results in a lethal level of <b>Hog</b> 1 p activation. Overexpression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase Ptp 2 p suppresses the lethality of these mutations by dephosphorylating <b>Hog</b> 1 p. A catalytically inactive Cys-to-Ser Ptp 2 p mutant (Ptp 2 (C/S) p) is tightly bound to tyrosine-phosphorylated <b>Hog</b> 1 p in vivo. Disruption of PTP 2 leads to elevated levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated <b>Hog</b> 1 p following exposure of cells to high osmolarity. Disruption of both PTP 2 and another protein tyrosine phosphatase gene, PTP 3, results in constitutive <b>Hog</b> 1 p tyrosine phosphorylation {{even in the absence of}} increased osmolarity. Thus, Ptp 2 p and Ptp 3 p are the major phosphatases responsible for the tyrosine dephosphorylation of <b>Hog</b> 1 p. When catalytically inactive <b>Hog</b> 1 (K/N) p is expressed in <b>hog</b> 1 delta cells, it is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated. In contrast, <b>Hog</b> 1 (K/N) p, expressed together with wild-type <b>Hog</b> 1 p, is tyrosine phosphorylated only when cells are exposed to high osmolarity. Thus, the kinase activity of <b>Hog</b> 1 p is required for its own tyrosine dephosphorylation. Northern blot analyses suggest that <b>Hog</b> 1 p regulates Ptp 2 p and/or Ptp 3 p activity at the posttranscriptional level...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the impact of {{structural}} changes in <b>hog</b> production manure management practices.
