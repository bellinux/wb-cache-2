The substance {{is intended to}} be used as a flavour modifier and the current evaluation is only applicable to this use. Information on the ratios of diastereoisomers of the substance has been provided (cis 20 - 40 % and trans 60 - 80 %). Information on the ratio of enantiomers is lacking. The available data on genotoxicity do not preclude the evaluation of the candidate substance [FL-no: 16. 119] through the Procedure. The substance was evaluated through the B-side of the Procedure. A 'No Observed Adverse Effect Level' (NOAEL) of 55 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day could be derived for [FL-no: 16. 119] from a 90 -day subchronic toxicity study in rats. This NOAEL provides an adequate margin of safety of 1. 4 x 10 (6), based on the 'Maximised Survey-Derived Daily Intake' (MSDI) of 2. 4 mu g/capita per day.

The substance has not been reported to occur in natural source materials of botanical or animal origin. It {{is intended to be}} used as both the parent compound and its hemisulfate monohydrate salt as a <b>flavouring</b> <b>substance</b> with modifying properties in specific categories of food.

40|$|Detecting {{the taste}} {{components}} within a <b>flavoured</b> <b>substance</b> relies on exposing chemoreceptors within the mouth to the chemical components of ingested food. In our paper, {{we show that}} the evaluation of taste components can also {{be influenced by the}} tactile quality of the food. We first discuss how multisensory factors might influence taste, flavour and smell for both typical and atypical (synaesthetic) populations and we then present two empirical studies showing tactile-taste interactions in the general population. We asked a group of non-synaesthetic adults to evaluate the taste components of <b>flavoured</b> food <b>substances,</b> whilst we presented simultaneous cross-sensory visuo-tactile cues within the eating environment. Specifically, we presented foodstuffs between subjects that were otherwise identical but had a rough versus smooth surface, or were served on a rough versus smooth serving-plate. We found no effect of the serving-plate, but we found the rough/smoothness of the foodstuff itself significantly influenced perception: food was rated as significantly more sour if it had a rough (versus smooth) surface. In modifying taste perception via ostensibly unrelated dimensions, we demonstrate that the detection of tastes within flavours may be influenced by higher level cross-sensory cues. Finally, we suggest that the direction of our cross-sensory associations may speak to the types of hedonic mapping found both in normal multisensory integration, and in the unusual condition of synaesthesia. © 2015...|$|R

40|$|The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has {{conducted}} an assessment {{on the use}} of <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> in infant and follow-on formula and in foods for special medical purposes intended for infants and young children. In the opinion of the BfR, <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> are neither required to improve acceptance of such products nor to support development of taste sensation. […] Since infant formula is a standardised product, even the addition of <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> does not provide the spectrum of flavours that breast milk offers infants. Based on the current state of knowledge, flavoured infant foods cannot, therefore, support the development of a baby’s sense of taste and smell in the way that breast milk can. Babies are especially vulnerable during {{the first few months of}} life: the body’s detoxification systems […]. Therefore, international expert committees emphasise that the ADI values derived for food additives are not to be applied to babies up to the age of 12 weeks. […] The BfR is of the opinion that the rationale behind the use of food additives in baby food should also apply to the use of <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> in baby foods. […] <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> should be used neither in the production of infant formula nor in balanced diets intended for babies aged less than three months.

What's more, it has long been known that in animal experiments coumarin can trigger the formation of tumours. More recent scientific findings indicate that there is no genotoxic mechanism of action, something which had been suspected for a long time. The European Commission thereupon submitted a draft amendment to the Flavourings Directive which envisages removing the existing constraints on coumarin. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) took another look at coumarin from the angle of consumer health protection.

40|$|The supplementing {{of wheat}} flour with enzyme {{preparations}} containing amylases, proteinases and lipoxygenase {{has been widely}} adopted in mills and bakeries. While the three enzymes are present in sound wheat, they normally occur in levels insuf-ficient to produce optimal technological effects. In milling sound, mature wheat these enzyme are retained in low levels and the flour is fortified with controlled amounts of enzyme (R�� � 1975). Since wheat flour contains an adequate amount of native β-amylase, the supplementation of flour with amylase aims at an increase in α-amylase activity. Originally, malted barley flour was used to this aim, than it was replaced by malted wheat flour and recently by fungal α-amylase.

The Panel concluded that the 56 substances [FL-no: 02. 125, 02. 138, 02. 152, 02. 170, 02. 175, 02. 176, 02. 195, 02. 201, 02. 222, 02. 229, 02. 234, 05. 061, 05. 082, 05. 137, 05. 143, 05. 170, 05. 174, 05. 188, 05. 203, 05. 217, 05. 218, 05. 220, 05. 226, 08. 074, 08. 100, 08. 102, 09. 341, 09. 368, 09. 377, 09. 562, 09. 567, 09. 569, 09. 572, 09. 575, 09. 612, 09. 638, 09. 640, 09. 643, 09. 672, 09. 673, 09. 674, 09. 831, 09. 838, 09. 854, 09. 855, 09. 871, 09. 872, 09. 884, 09. 885, 09. 897, 09. 898, 09. 928, 09. 937, 09. 938, 09. 939 and 09. 950] do not give rise to safety concern at their levels of dietary intake, estimated {{on the basis of}} the MSDI approach. Besides the safety assessment of these <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances,</b> the specifications for the materials of commerce have also been considered. Adequate specifications including complete purity criteria and identity for the materials of commerce have been provided for all 56 candidate substances...|$|E
40|$|Food {{is asked}} to {{evaluate}} substances used as flavourings, or present in flavourings or present in other food ingredients with flavouring properties. In particular, the Panel {{is asked to}} advise the Commission on the implications for human health of furfural and furfural diethylacetal in the diet. The Panel noted that the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) had expressed an opinion on furfural and furfural diethylacetal in December 2002 and took cognizance of the documentation used in arriving at that opinion. The Panel also considered additional data on the potential genotoxicity of furfural not {{available at the time}} of the SCF opinion. The new toxicological data on the genotoxic potential of furfural addressed the reservation of the SCF concerning the mechanism by which furfural induced tumours (hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas) and whether this was a thresholded process. The Panel concluded that, the new study in a transgenic mouse strain demonstrated that furfural did not induce gene mutations in vivo. Based on this, together with earlier studies reviewed by the SCF, the Panel concluded that the tumour induction was secondary to chronic toxic liver injury and was probably thresholded. Since furfural diethylacetal is rapidly converted to furfural at physiological pH, the Panel established an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for furfural and the furfural component of furfural diethylacetal of 0. 5 mg/kg bw based on a NOAEL (no-observed-adverse-effect level) for hepatotoxicity in a 90 -day study in rats of 54 mg/kg bw/day to which a safety factor of 100 was applied. The Panel notes that the available estimates of intake from all sources (natural and use as a chemically defined <b>flavouring</b> <b>substance)</b> suggest that intakes in consumers may approach the ADI and that refined estimates of intake in the EU are desirable...|$|R
50|$|Concluding, the {{treatment}} of lyophilization (freeze dried) of donkey’s milk demonstrated that the natural colour, <b>flavours,</b> nutrients, bioactive <b>substances</b> of the fresh donkey milk are retained. Instead, with the spray-drying method, another way to dry products, the milk is being heated whereby vitamins and other important bioactive substances will get lost. In addition Freeze-dried don't require chemical preservatives and can be either consumed directly or re hydrated easily. However, this method for its high costs is practiced only by a few companies.|$|R
40|$|The EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids was {{requested}} {{to evaluate the}} genotoxic potential of one <b>flavouring</b> <b>substance</b> from subgroup 1. 1. 1 (b) of FGE. 19 in the Flavouring Group Evaluation 226 (FGE. 226). The flavour industry provided genotoxicity studies for the substance 4, 5 -epoxydec- 2 (trans) -enal [FL-no: 16. 071]. Based on these data, the Panel concluded in FGE. 226 that 4, 5 -epoxydec- 2 (trans) -enal did not induce gene mutations in bacterial cells but was positive in an in vitro micronucleus assay, so, 4, 5 -epoxydec- 2 (trans) -enal is considered an in vitro genotoxic agent. The negative results obtained in an in vivo micronucleus assay cannot overrule the positive results of the in vitro micronucleus assay with and without S 9 -mix {{due to the lack}} of demonstration of bone marrow exposure. Following this, the flavour industry has provided plasma analysis of a satellite group of rats treated with 4, 5 -epoxydec- 2 (trans) -enal in order to investigate the systemic exposure of animals in the in vivo micronucleus assay. However, the plasma analysis did not provide enough evidence of target tissue exposure. An in vivo Comet assay in rodents was recommended in FGE. 226, in order to investigate possible genotoxic effects at the first site of contact (e. g. stomach/duodenum cells) and in the liver. An in vivo Comet assay in liver and duodenum was provided that suggests that 4, 5 -epoxydec- 2 (trans) -enal [FL-no: 16. 071] did not induce DNA damage in the duodenum of rats. However, the genotoxic effect observed in vitro was confirmed in the in vivo Comet assay in the liver of rats. The Panel concluded that 4, 5 -epoxydec- 2 (trans) -enal [FL-no: 16. 071] does raise a safety concern with respect to genotoxicity and, therefore, it cannot be evaluated according to the Procedure...|$|R
