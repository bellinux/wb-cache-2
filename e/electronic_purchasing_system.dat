40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to identify {{one of the}} necessary conditions for self-healing, or self-repair, in complex systems, and to propose means for satisfying this condition in heterogeneous distributed software. The condition identified here is the following: For a system with a wide and open range of possible configurations to be self healing, it must possess suitable regularities, which can be relied upon to be satisfied by all possible configurations of the system, and which must be invariant of its failures. We observe that self healing in physical artifacts, {{as well as in}} biological systems, are largely based on regularities engendered by the laws of nature. But since laws of nature have no effective sway over the behavior of software, we propose means for imposing artificial laws over a given distributed system, which are designed to induce desired regularities in them. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by applying it to a simple example of <b>electronic</b> <b>purchasing</b> in enterprise <b>systems.</b> 1...|$|R

Data for this report came from a survey of consumers (N = 411) with a structured questionnaire design. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), ANOVA and Post-hoc (for multiple comparisons) were used to achieve the objectives of the study. To contribute to an internationally valid and reliable research instrument for consumer decision-making style in the context of <b>electronic</b> <b>purchasing,</b> new constructs were identified, which we will call Electronic Consumer Style Inventory (ECSI). Consistent with the hypotheses, in general, the extracted factors in consumers’ electronic buying decision-making style are found to be significant on the basis of respondent gender and age.
