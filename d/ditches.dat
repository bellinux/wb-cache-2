5|$|Colchester {{has been}} {{inhabited}} since pre-Roman Britain, but the ancient route to Ipswich followed a different path, leaving Duncan's Gate and heading east of Castle Park and crossing the River Colne, thereby heading northeast {{to meet the}} current road. An excavation in 1930 found evidence of road <b>ditches</b> on this alignment.|$|E
5|$|Maiden Castle {{expanded}} westwards, and {{the ditch}} {{was extended to}} enclose the neighbouring Hog Hill. The peaks of the two hills encompassed by the new, larger hill fort were separated by a dry valley. A shaft dug into the valley was possibly used as a water source. Almost immediately after the single ditch enclosure was expanded to , work began on making the defences more elaborate. The existing rampart was heightened to , and more ramparts and <b>ditches</b> were added. On {{the south of the}} fort, four ramparts and three <b>ditches</b> were added, but because of the steepness of the northern slope of the hill the fourth rampart did not extend all the way round, and only three ramparts were built on the northern side. At the same time, the eastern entrance was again made more complex through the addition of further earthworks, lengthening the approach to the site.|$|E

5|$|Southampton's town {{walls are}} a {{sequence}} of defensive structures built around the town in southern England. Although earlier Roman and Anglo-Saxon settlements around Southampton had been fortified with walls or <b>ditches,</b> the later walls originate with the move of the town to the current site in the 10th century. This new town was defended by banks, <b>ditches</b> and the natural curve {{of the river and}} coastline. The Normans built a castle in Southampton but made no attempts to improve the wider defences of the town until the early 13th century, when Southampton's growing prosperity as a trading centre and conflict with France encouraged the construction of a number of gatehouses and stone walls to the north and east sides of the settlement.|$|E

The nationally restricted brackish water-crowfoot (Ranunculus baudotii) and sea clubrush (Scirpus maritimus) indicate the slightly brackish nature of the water.|$|E

It is able to survive in other habitats also.|$|E

5|$|Chatteris is {{situated}} between Huntingdon, St Ives, Peterborough, March and Ely, {{in the middle}} of The Fensâ€”the lowest-lying area in the United Kingdomâ€”with most of the land surrounding the town being below sea level, although the highest point in the Fens (36 feet above sea level) is within Chatteris's parish boundaries. The peaty land surrounding the town is largely used for agriculture, drained by numerous <b>ditches</b> and dykes, and there are two large drainage rivers near the town â€“ the Forty Foot Drain, also known as Vermuyden's Drain, and the Sixteen Foot Drain.|$|E

5|$|Cow Tower is an {{artillery}} tower {{that was built}} in the city of Norwich, Norfolk, England, between 1398 and 1399. Norwich was a prosperous city in the late 14th century, with a population of around 5,000 involved in key medieval industries and forming a centre for international trade. Between 1297 and 1350 the city had erected a circuit of defensive stone walls and <b>ditches,</b> both to impress upon outsiders the status of Norwich as a great city, but also to defend against invasion or civil disorder.|$|E

5|$|A major {{contributor}} to the sedimentation of the Little Applegate River is McDonald <b>Ditch,</b> an irrigation <b>ditch</b> near McDonald Creek. Built in 1920 to provide water to residents of nearby Wagner Creek, the <b>ditch</b> has failed numerous times, sending several tons of dirt and mud downstream. The Talent Irrigation District approved purchasing a $10,000 monitoring system for the <b>ditch</b> in September 2010, and applied for a $100,000 United States Bureau of Reclamation grant to replace the <b>ditch</b> with pipes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{drainage}} <b>ditch</b> {{is important}} for the plain reservoir, the water table in the dam foundation outside the enclosed dam can be lowered by the <b>ditch,</b> and some leakage water can be pumped from the <b>ditch</b> return to the reservoir. So the design of the drainage <b>ditch</b> {{is the key to the}} plain reservoir. The finite element method is used to investigate the effects of the position, width, depth and the relief well of the <b>ditch</b> on the drainage effects. The results show that the drainage flow is proportional to the depth of the drainage <b>ditch,</b> and is inversely proportional to the distance between the <b>ditch</b> and dam, and the relief well can increase the drainage flow and lower the grounder water table...|$|R
5|$|DedakoviÄ‡'s second-in-command, Branko BorkoviÄ‡, {{was another}} former JNA {{officer who had}} volunteered for service in Vukovar. The two men {{established}} a unified command structure, organised the defenders into a single brigade and implemented an integrated defence system. A defensive ring of six sectors was established, each assigned to one unit within the 204th Brigade. The defenders used a network of cellars, canals, <b>ditches</b> and trenches to redeploy around the sectors as needed.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, landowners {{along the}} slough had formed three {{drainage}} districts to control floods. They dug <b>ditches,</b> deepened existing water channels, and built levees {{to keep the}} rivers and the slough from flooding agricultural, industrial, and commercial property. Hoping to flush the slough with clean water from the river, city engineers created the crosscutting Peninsula Canal. The project largely failed because daily tides reversed the slough's flow and because {{both ends of the}} canal were at nearly the same elevation.|$|E
5|$|In practice, {{there was}} a wide number of {{variations}} to this common design. A castle could {{have more than one}} bailey: at Warkworth Castle an inner and an outer bailey was constructed, or alternatively, several baileys could flank the motte, as at Windsor Castle. Some baileys had two mottes, such as those at Lincoln. Some mottes could be square instead of round, such as at Cabal Trump. Instead of single <b>ditches,</b> occasionally double-ditch defences were built, as seen at Berkhamsted. Local geography and the intent of the builder produced many unique designs.|$|E
50|$|The Osgood <b>Ditch</b> is a 9.2 mi {{section of}} mining <b>ditch</b> located in {{southern}} Josephine County, Oregon, and northern Del Norte County, California. The <b>ditch</b> supplied {{water from the}} East Fork of the Illinois River to the High Gravel and Cameron mines, two hydraulic mines that conducted placer gold mining operations in the Upper Illinois Valley. The <b>ditch</b> was dug around 1900, {{at the same time}} that the High Gravel Mine was built. It took its name from F.H. Osgood, who purchased the mine shortly after its construction and expanded the <b>ditch.</b> When the Cameron Mine began hydraulic operations in the 1910s, the <b>ditch</b> brought water to that mine as well. The <b>ditch</b> was last used in 1942, after which point both mines had shut down.|$|R
