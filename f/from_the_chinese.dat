5|$|Although the UN aerial {{reconnaissance}} observed on November 27 that the Chinese {{forces on the}} UN right flank were moving rapidly into the Eighth Army's rear, Walker still ordered {{the rest of the}} Eighth Army to continue the offensive north. Convinced that the collapse of the ROK II Corps was merely a small counterattack by the Chinese, Walker ordered the US I and IX Corps to shift eastward in order to cover the ROK II Corps' sector. By that time, however, the US I and IX Corps had already suffered heavy losses <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> counteroffensive at Kujang-dong, Ipsok and Yongsan-dong.|$|E
5|$|Burzahom's ceramic {{industry}} was mostly of hunting based culture and is different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> Neolithic pottery.

Pottery made in Burzahom showed close affinity to those found in the Swat valley in Pakistan, particularly in respect of its shapes and decorations of the black ware pottery. The burial practices and type of tools recovered from the site were inferred as having close resemblance to those found in the North Chinese Neolithic culture.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{suffering}} over 50 percent casualties by {{this time}} and with few reinforcements, 3rd Ranger Company remained on the line, and {{was used as a}} reconnaissance element for the division. As the 3rd Infantry Division advanced, pressing gains <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese,</b> the company was used to guard a vital bridge over the Hantan River. It then massed with several combat engineers and other division elements to form Task Force Rogers. The task force then probed north searching for Chinese concentrations, but did not encounter any Chinese troops.|$|E

Using a blacklist provided by China, hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners were turned away by the national airline or detained if they managed {{to make it to}} the country. The blacklisting ignited protests by Icelandic citizens and members of parliament. In 2011, Iceland's foreign minister Össur Skarphéðinsson issued an apology for violating Falun Gong practitioners' freedom of expression and movement.|$|E
5|$|In the division's {{first few}} months on the line, Chinese forces {{conducted}} three raids in its sector. In retaliation, the 245th Tank Battalion sent nine tanks to raid Agok. Two companies of Chinese forces ambushed and devastated a patrol from the 179th Infantry a short time later. In the spring, the division launched Operation Counter, which {{was an effort to}} establish 11 patrol bases around Old Baldy Hill.

5|$|Shortly after this, however, Chinese infiltrators began {{appearing}} {{regularly in the}} undermanned 2nd Company's area, and by 15 May, Queen discovered the Chinese were moving in force to Hill 581, several miles from their position, from which the Chinese could fortify and attack Hill 258. Queen led the platoon on a sneak attack of the Chinese force on 17 May, covered by 7th Division artillery fire. At 15:00, they engaged the surprised Chinese, conducting a double envelopment supported by continued artillery fire. By 17:00, the Rangers secured Hill 581 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese,</b> who suffered 50 killed and 90 wounded in the attack.|$|E
5|$|The Teochew dialect {{became the}} lingua franca among the Chinese {{in many parts}} of Johor and Riau, as the {{majority}} of the Chinese from these areas were of Teochew origin, many of whom were descended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> coolies who had worked in the gambier and pepper plantations. The Teochews form the second-largest dialect group among Chinese Singaporeans, and many families can trace their family ancestry to immigrants who were Kangchu or coolies in these plantations.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Buddhism during {{the sixth century}} was a catalyst for large-scale temple building using complicated techniques in wood. Influence <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> Tang and Sui Dynasties led to {{the foundation of the}} first permanent capital in Nara. Its checkerboard street layout used the Chinese capital of Chang'an as a template for its design. A gradual increase in the size of buildings led to standard units of measurement as well as refinements in layout and garden design. The {{introduction of}} the tea ceremony emphasised simplicity and modest design as a counterpoint to the excesses of the aristocracy.|$|E

5|$|With no {{government}} enforcement <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> or the British {{aside from a}} few raids by the Hong Kong Police, the Walled City became a haven for crime and drugs.

5|$|A new offer {{had arrived}} for Pei <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> {{government}} in 1982. With {{an eye toward}} the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the Bank of China. The Chinese government was preparing for {{a new wave of}} engagement with the outside world and sought a tower to represent modernity and economic strength. Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement. Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal. Although the architect remained pained by his experience with Fragrant Hill, he agreed to accept the commission.|$|E
