5|$|The {{first act}} {{in this new}} war was Philip's seizure of 230 grain ships that had been waiting {{on the far side}} of the Bosphorus to be convoyed past Byzantion by Chares. He used the grain for his own {{supplies}} and the ships' timbers to build siege engines. However, what happened over the next few months is unclear; although to judge by Philip's activities in 339 BC, he cannot have spent more than three months besieging Byzantion. The walls of Byzantion were very tall and strong, and the city was full of defenders, and well supplied by sea; it is therefore possible Philip gave up on the siege, rather than waste time and men trying to assault it. The Greeks viewed this, and the abandonment of the siege of Perinthos, as a glorious victory. Philip's motives are as unclear as ever; Cawkwell suggests that, since he was now at war with Athens, he decided to <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> root of the problem, rather than be detained at Byzantion.|$|E

Passengers {{arriving at}} the SkyPier board buses to the terminal and arriving air passengers board ferries at the pier for their ride back to the PRD.

As of August 2007, SkyPier serves Shenzhen's Shekou and Fuyong, Dongguan's Humen, Macau, Zhongshan and Zhuhai.

25|$|Almost all {{civil work}} is {{dealt with by}} either the High Court or County Courts. Prior to the Act, there was a simple {{financial}} boundary to decide which cases would go to which court—any contract or tort case valued at less than £5,000 {{would go to the}} County Courts, while any case valued at more than that would <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> High Court. Section 1 of the Act allows the Lord Chancellor to change the financial boundaries after consultation with senior judges such as the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls, and also allows the Lord Chancellor to create categories based on things other than the financial value of the case, such as the complexity involved or the importance of any legal question likely to be raised. An exception to this rule is that the Lord Chancellor cannot ask a County Court to hear any case of judicial review.|$|E

Bennington commented on the collaborations, stating that [...] "We really felt like {{if we need to}} be inspired and move in another direction. I think when we got Page in, Mike had written this chorus and sang it, and his voice had this tone, and it was unlike anything I'd heard from him before. And I was like, [...] "Dude this is crazy, this sounds like a Helmet song! It's cool!" [...] And we were like, [...] "Dude, why don't we {{see if we can get}} like Page in here?" [...] You know?

500|$|Jones v Kaney [...] UKSC 13 is a 2011 {{decision}} of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom on whether expert witnesses retained by a party in litigation can be sued for professional negligence, or whether they {{have the benefit of}} immunity from suit. [...] The case involved a psychologist (Kaney) instructed as an expert witness in a personal injury claim, who was said to have negligently signed a statement of matters agreed with the expert instructed by the opposing side, in which she made a number of concessions that weakened the claim considerably. As a result, according to the injured claimant (Jones), he had to settle the claim for much less than he would have obtained had his expert not been careless. [...] To succeed in the claim, he had to overturn an earlier Court of Appeal decision that had decided that preparation of a joint statement with the other side's expert was covered by immunity from suit. [...] Kaney therefore succeeded in getting the claim struck out before trial on an application heard by Mr Justice Blake in the High Court of Justice. [...] The judge issued a certificate allowing the claimant to [...] "leapfrog" [...] the Court of Appeal and <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court to appeal against his decision.|$|E

This fulfills an early promise by Villages of Urbana developer Tom Natelli, who dedicated the land for the park in 2004. The goal of {{the first phase of}} new development of Urbana District Park was to provide athletic facilities, as well as several passive recreational amenities for the southern region of Frederick County, which was lacking in open sports fields. The $5.9 million Phase I construction included two multipurpose fields, one football/lacrosse field, one baseball field, one softball field, one little league field, a new entrance drive, parking, walking/ biking trails, water and electric utilities, restrooms, picnic pavilions, playground, park maintenance facility, landscaping/reforestation and various site amenities. Three parking lots create a total of 466 spaces. One of the most convenient features of the park is that its walking trails connect to the main Villages of Urbana walking trails, meaning you could travel along the walking trails from within Urbana and <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> park without having to leave the trail.|$|E
