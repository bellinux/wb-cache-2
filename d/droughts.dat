40|$|<b>Drought</b> is {{the leading}} natural {{disaster}} in the United States in terms of monetary losses. The National Research Council (1995) estimates that <b>drought</b> costs the United States an average of $ 6 – 8 billion per year. Because of these losses and the great effects of <b>drought</b> on many citizens’ quality of life, <b>drought</b> planning is gaining widespread support in the United States. However, U. S. <b>drought</b> planning within the agricultural sector has historically focused on response measures that help producers, primarily farmers, deal with and recover from <b>drought.</b> It {{has been found that}} these often ad-hoc <b>drought</b> responses are very expensive and do little to reduce ongoing <b>drought</b> vulnerability (Wilhite, 1997). Subsequently, current national <b>drought</b> planning efforts, as discussed in Preparing for <b>Drought</b> in the 21 st Century (National <b>Drought</b> Policy Commission, 2000), have shifted to an emphasis on <b>drought</b> mitigation programs—that is, modifying operations before a <b>drought</b> strikes {{in order to reduce the}} impending negative impacts. In terms of agricultural <b>drought</b> planning, these programs necessitate increased communication between agricultural producers, private businesses, and government planners. Since its inception in 1995, the National <b>Drought</b> Mitigation Center (NDMC) has striven to promote <b>drought</b> mitigation planning and increase the communication between federal, state, and local <b>drought</b> planners. Essential in these endeavors is input from agricultural producers that deal with <b>drought</b> at the “ground level. ” Therefore, a study was undertaken to gain insight into agricultural producers’ perceptions of current <b>drought</b> issues, which yielded valuable information on several topics, including perceptions of <b>drought</b> vulnerability, the use of climate forecast information, the implementation of <b>drought</b> mitigation measures, and the roles of external groups in <b>drought</b> planning...|$|R
5|$|All such {{episodes of}} severe drought {{correlate}} with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. El Niño-related <b>droughts</b> {{have also been}} implicated in periodic declines in Indian agricultural output. Nevertheless, ENSO events that have coincided with abnormally high sea surfaces temperatures in the Indian Ocean—in one instance during 1997 and 1998 by up to —have resulted in increased oceanic evaporation, resulting in unusually wet weather across India. Such anomalies have occurred during a sustained warm spell {{that began in the}} 1990s. A contrasting phenomenon is that, instead of the usual high pressure air mass over the southern Indian Ocean, an ENSO-related oceanic low pressure convergence centre forms; it then continually pulls dry air from Central Asia, desiccating India during what should have been the humid summer monsoon season. This reversed air flow causes India's <b>droughts.</b> The extent that an ENSO event raises sea surface temperatures in the central Pacific Ocean influences the extent of drought.|$|E

5|$|Climate-related natural {{disasters}} cause massive losses of Indian life and property. <b>Droughts,</b> flash floods, cyclones, avalanches, landslides {{brought on by}} torrential rains, and snowstorms pose the greatest threats. Other dangers include frequent summer dust storms, which usually track from north to south; they cause extensive property damage in North India and deposit large amounts of dust from arid regions. Hail is also common in parts of India, causing severe damage to standing crops such as rice and wheat.|$|E
40|$|<b>Drought</b> is firstly a {{resource}} issue, {{and with its}} development it evolves into a disaster issue. <b>Drought</b> events usually occur in a determinate but a random manner. <b>Drought</b> {{has become one of}} the major factors to affect sustainable socioeconomic development. In this paper, we propose the generalized <b>drought</b> assessment index (GDAI) based on water resources systems for assessing <b>drought</b> events. The GDAI considers water supply and water demand using a distributed hydrological model. We demonstrate the use of the proposed index in the Dongliao River basin in northeastern China. The results simulated by the GDAI are compared to observed <b>drought</b> disaster records in the Dongliao River basin. In addition, the temporal distribution of <b>drought</b> events and the spatial distribution of <b>drought</b> frequency from the GDAI are compared with the traditional approaches in general (i. e., standard precipitation index, Palmer <b>drought</b> severity index and rate of water deficit index). Then, generalized <b>drought</b> times, generalized <b>drought</b> duration, and generalized <b>drought</b> severity were calculated by theory of runs. Application of said runs at various <b>drought</b> levels (i. e., mild <b>drought,</b> moderate <b>drought,</b> severe <b>drought,</b> and extreme <b>drought)</b> during the period 1960 – 2010 shows that the centers of gravity of them all distribute in the middle reaches of Dongliao River basin, and change with time. The proposed methodology may help water managers in water-stressed regions to quantify the impact of <b>drought,</b> and consequently, to make decisions for coping with <b>drought...</b>|$|R
