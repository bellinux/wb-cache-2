25|$|There {{are also}} brief glosses on six minor judges: Shamgar (3:31), Tola and Jair (10:1–5), Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon (12:8–15). Some {{scholars}} have inferred that the minor <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> actual adjudicators, whereas the major <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> leaders and didn't actually make legal judgements. The only time a major <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> {{said to have}} made legal judgments was Deborah (4:4).|$|R

50|$|Additionally, {{the county}} <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> a {{statutory}} member of several important boards, including the juvenile {{board and the}} county election commission. Finally, the <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> designated by a long-standing executive order of the governor, pursuant to the Texas Disaster Act of 1974, as the executive officer for civil defense within the county. The county <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> elected county wide to a four-year term coinciding with the term of the governor.|$|R
5|$|Muslims {{are obliged}} to follow the {{decisions}} of Syariah courts in matters concerning their religion. The Islamic <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> expected to follow the Shafi'i legal school of Islam, which is the main madh'hab of Malaysia. The jurisdiction of Syariah courts is limited to Muslims in matters such as marriage, inheritance, divorce, apostasy, religious conversion, and custody among others. No other criminal or civil offences are {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Shariah courts, which have a similar hierarchy to the Civil Courts. Despite being the supreme courts of the land, the Civil Courts do not hear matters related to Islamic practices.|$|E
5|$|The Texas {{constitution}} {{defines the}} responsibilities of county governments, which serve as agents of the state. What are called commissioners court and court <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> elected {{to serve as the}} administrative arm.

5|$|The {{governor}} {{also can}} influence the state court system through the appointment of judges. In Indiana, when vacancies occur on the Supreme Court, Tax Court, and circuit courts, the Judicial Nominating Commission interviews candidates and sends a list of three candidates for each vacancy to the governor, who chooses one. Justices of the peace and superior courts <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> elected in Indiana; if a vacancy occurs (such as by death or resignation) the governor may make an appointment, who holds the office until the next general election. The authority to make such appointments gives the governor considerable sway in setting {{the makeup of the}} judiciary.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, at {{the request}} of the Court, the {{legislature}} simplified its organization. The regional sections were abolished and the responsibilities of the Senior Associate Chief Judge and the Associate Chief <b>Judges</b> <b>were</b> redefined. To coordinate the Court’s activities throughout its territory, ten Coordinating <b>Judges</b> <b>were</b> appointed. In some regions, the Coordinating <b>Judge</b> <b>was</b> assisted by one or more Associate Coordinating Judges responsible for the coordination of one of the divisions.|$|R

5|$|The {{interview}} and speech events are {{graded by two}} to three judges. The scores from the <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> averaged to give a maximum of 1,000 points per event. The essay is graded with a rubric and is read by two different judges whose scores are then averaged. If {{the difference between the}} judges' scores differs by 200 points or more, then a third reader is asked to grade the student's essay. The two scores that are closest in value are averaged to give the final score.|$|E
5|$|On occasion, a {{judge will}} leave {{office at the}} end of a term, in which case a general {{election}} determines their replacement. If the Supreme Court needs an additional judge on a temporary basis due to illness, an unfilled position, or a justice is disqualified from sitting on a case due to a conflict of interest, the court can appoint a senior judge to serve as a judge pro tempore. Senior <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> all former, qualified judges (a minimum of 12 years on the bench) that have retired from a state court. Only former Supreme Court justices, elected Oregon circuit court judges, or elected Oregon Court of Appeals judges can be assigned to temporary service on the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|The Governor's {{power to}} appoint and {{nominate}} the judges of the Supreme and Superior Courts, {{with the consent}} of the Senate, is established.

The term of office of Justices and Judges, including their retirement ages and pensions, is stated. Impeachment of Justices and Judges is also legalized, and their inabiling of powers until acquitted. During their term, the <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> restricted to one public office and may not practice law outside the state government. The powers of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court are enumerated. Terms specifying costs of the facilities and materials used by the Justice Department are listed.|$|E

50|$|When the NFL began play, {{only three}} {{officials}} (referee, umpire, and head linesman) were used. The field <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> added in 1929 {{and the back}} judge in 1947. In response to scrambling quarterbacks (Fran Tarkenton in particular), the line <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> added in 1965 to watch {{the opposite side of}} the line of scrimmage. The side <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> added for 1978, when the NFL implemented new rules to open up the passing game.|$|R

5|$|World Fantasy Award nominees and {{winners are}} decided by judges and {{attendees}} of the World Fantasy Convention. A ballot is posted in June for attendees {{of the current}} and previous two conferences to determine two of the finalists, with the two most-nominated selected, and a panel of five judges adds three or more nominees before voting on the overall winner. The panel of judges is typically made up of fantasy authors, {{as well as other}} fantasy professionals and is chosen each year by the World Fantasy Awards Administration, which has the power to break ties if the <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> deadlocked. The awards administration is a subgroup of the World Fantasy Convention Board, which selects sites for upcoming World Fantasy Conventions. Both the board and the judges panel are largely made up of professionals in the field of fantasy. The judges for the 2014 awards, for example, were authors Andy Duncan, Kij Johnson, Oliver Johnson, and Liz Williams, and editor John Klima.|$|E
5|$|The {{judiciary}} in {{the state}} consists of the Allahabad High Court in Allahabad, the Lucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court, district courts and session courts in each district or Sessions Division, and lower courts at the tehsil level. The President of India appoints the {{chief justice of the}} High Court of the Uttar Pradesh judiciary on the advice of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India as well as the Governor of Uttar Pradesh. Other <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> appointed by the President of India on the advice of the Chief Justice of the High Court. Subordinate Judicial Service, categorized into two divisions viz. Uttar Pradesh civil judicial services and Uttar Pradesh higher judicial service is another vital part of the judiciary of Uttar Pradesh. While the Uttar Pradesh civil judicial services comprise the Civil Judges (Junior Division)/Judicial Magistrates and civil judges (Senior Division)/Chief Judicial Magistrate, the Uttar Pradesh higher judicial service comprises civil and sessions judges. The Subordinate judicial service (viz. The district court of Etawah and the district court of Kanpur Dehat) of the judiciary at Uttar Pradesh is controlled by the District Judge.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject-matter}} of {{a dispute}} must be justiciable before the High Court {{will hear the}} case. A decision by an executive authority will generally be considered non-justiciable if the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, and <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> ill-equipped to decide the case because of their limited training, experience and access to materials; if a judicial pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands {{in the conduct of}} affairs traditionally falling within its purview; or if the decision involves the exercise of a prerogative power that the democratically elected branches are entrusted to take care of. Nonetheless, a dispute may prima facie involve a non-justiciable area but the courts may decide that there is a justiciable matter within it, or the courts may be able to isolate a pure question of law from what is seemingly a non-justiciable issue. Because of the principle that all powers have legal limits, the Attorney-General's exercise of prosecutorial discretion and the power to pardon or grant clemency to convicted persons exercised by the President on the Cabinet's advice are both justiciable in exceptional cases, for instance, where the powers have been exercised unconstitutionally or in bad faith.|$|E
