2500|$|The {{contour mining}} method {{consists}} of removing overburden from the seam {{in a pattern}} following the contours along a ridge or around the hillside. This method is most commonly used in areas with rolling to steep terrain. It was once common to deposit the spoil on the downslope side of the bench thus created, but this method of spoil disposal consumed much additional land and created severe landslide and erosion problems. To alleviate these problems, {{a variety of methods}} were devised to use freshly cut overburden to refill mined-out areas. These <b>haul-back</b> or lateral movement methods generally consist of an initial cut with the spoil deposited downslope or at some other site and spoil from the second cut refilling the first.

40|$|Comparative fishing {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the selectivity and efficiency of escape mechanisms installed in traditional snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) traps. Performance of the different trap types (control, traditional, experimental) were compared {{on the basis of}} size distribution caught, numbers of animals per trap haul (CPUEN), and size selectivity. The study demonstrated that either 95 or 100 mm diameter escape mechanisms installed into traditional 14. 0 cm mesh traps resulted in 38 – 47 % fewer undersized pre-recruit (101 mm CW). Qualitative underwater behavioural observations were also conducted for snow crab in response to baited traps, corroborating current understandings as well as documenting new observations related to crab behaviour during capture, escape, <b>haul-back,</b> and interspecific competition with Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) ...|$|E
40|$|Marine mammal {{by-catch}} in 11 {{pelagic trawl}} fisheries operated by four different {{countries in the}} northeast Atlantic was studied. Observers accompanied commercial fishing vessels and monitored 374 tows totalling 1771 h of towing during 377 days fishing. Three species of marine mammal were identified in by-catches (white-sided dolphin, Lagenorhynchus acutus, common dolphin, Delphinus delphis and grey seal Halichoerus grypus) and a fourth, bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus, was probably present. Dolphins were caught {{in four of the}} 11 fisheries and seal in one. In those fisheries with cetacean by-catch, rates varied from 0. 0606 to 0. 1000 per tow and 0. 0107 to 0. 0137 per hour of towing and were highest in the French sea bass fishery and lowest in the French tuna fishery. Grey seals were caught in the Irish Celtic Sea herring fishery at a rate of 0. 0513 per tow or 0. 0396 per hour of towing. The mean SD dolphin catch rate for all fisheries combined was 0. 0480. 013 per tow (one dolphin per 20. 7 tows), or 0. 01850. 0019 per hour of towing (one dolphin per 98 h of towing) and, for all marine mammals, 0. 0590. 019 (1 per 17. 0 tows) or 0. 01240. 0121 (1 per 80. 6 h of towing). 95 % confidence intervals, calculated on untransformed data, for all fisheries combined were 0. 4 – 1. 6 dolphins per 100 h of towing. No operational factors were correlated with by-catch rates but the <b>haul-back</b> procedure was identified as a potentially important factor. All dolphin by-catches occurred during the night which may be a due to an association between cetaceans and trawlers at night. White-sided dolphins and grey seals were observed feeding around the net during towing and thi...|$|E
