The authors present a network model of transborder cooperation between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus based on the case of the Kaliningrad and Grodno regions. The model is developed on the basis of the well-known and widely accepted PERT. It covers the three main stages of the whole transborder cooperation process identified in the case of the two regions — the Kaliningrad and Grodno: organisational and analytical support, methodological and technological support, and the development of a complex cooperation programme. The working version of the model includes approximately 150 events. As to its purpose, it is a representation of a well-balanced established international coordination programme of transboundary cooperation at a level of two regions. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the dynamics}} of the multilevel governance of migration flows between West Africa and Europe. Firstly, I examine bilateral, multilateral and <b>interregional</b> frames of <b>cooperation</b> on human mobility. Secondly, I analyse the type of governance emerging from the cooperation, focusing on his main axis -readmission and externalisation of control- and on the tools used to prompt the negotiation, and particularly on the linkage with development and the subsequent emergence of a ‘migratory conditionality’ in this field. Thirdly, I underline how, during the last decade and more clearly after the recent La Valletta’s EU-Africa summit on migration, a hegemonic European securitarian approach of human mobility had spread and has produced a de facto displacement of the Euro-African border. Finally, I consider the consequences of this rise of the immigration issue between Africa and Europe, {{from the point of view}} of States as well as people on the move...|$|R
