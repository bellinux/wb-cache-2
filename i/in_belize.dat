5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Belize,</b> a {{hurricane}} warning was issued about 23hours before Iris moved ashore. A state of national emergency was declared on October8 as Hurricane Iris neared landfall. All emergency response committees were activated to quickly begin recovery efforts. A mandatory evacuation was issued for Stann Creek and Toledo coastal villages and all offshore islands. The main hospital <b>in</b> <b>Belize</b> City was evacuated {{as a precaution}} and the city itself was placed under a voluntary evacuation order. Overall, 11,380people evacuated their homes <b>in</b> <b>Belize,</b> including many <b>in</b> <b>Belize</b> City. These evacuations were later credited for limiting the death toll. Hurricane Keith had struck the nation a year prior, preparing some citizens for what to expect. Disaster response teams arrived the day after Iris was projected to make landfall. Pan American Health Organization staff were on standby <b>in</b> <b>Belize,</b> Guatemala and Honduras and were ready to respond to any post-storm disease outbreaks.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Belize,</b> a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for the entire country at 0000UTC on October12. It was discontinued about nine hours later.

A small craft warning was declared along the coast and advised marines to take precautions. At Punta Negra, the National Guard of Belize evacuated residents on October13. However, no impact was reported <b>in</b> <b>Belize.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{with its}} first landfall, Hurricane Dean damaged crops {{throughout}} its impact area. In Puebla it destroyed 135,000ha (335,000acre) {{of corn and}} more than 22,000ha (54,000acre) of coffee, while in Veracruz 15,000ha (37,000acre) of various crops were lost. Unlike <b>in</b> <b>Belize</b> and the Eastern Caribbean, the storm spared the sugarcane crop in Veracruz.|$|E
5|$|Destruction was {{heaviest}} <b>in</b> <b>Belize</b> and totaled $250million (2001USD). Because Iris was compact, {{the damage}} was largely confined to 72% of the houses in the Toledo district and 50% of the houses in the Stann Creek district. The hurricane damaged or destroyed 3,718homes nationwide, and wrecked more than 95% of the homes in 35villages in the poorest parts of the country. Iris left about 15,000people homeless, many receiving assistance {{from the government and}} the local Red Cross chapter. High winds also damaged large swaths of forest and crops, mostly affecting the banana industry. Iris killed 24people <b>in</b> <b>Belize,</b> including 20 who died when a scuba diving boat capsized near Big Creek. The storm also killed eight people and damaged about 2,500homes in neighboring Guatemala, and later dropped heavy rainfall in southern Mexico, where two people died.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the major}} damage <b>in</b> <b>Belize,</b> the name Iris was retired {{in the spring}} of 2002 by the World Meteorological Organization and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Belize,</b> the {{hurricane}} was less severe than initially predicted, though Mitch still caused heavy rainfall across the country. Numerous rivers exceeded their crests, though the rainfall was beneficial to trees in mountainous areas. The flooding caused extensive crop damage and destroyed many roads. Throughout the country, eleven people {{died because of}} {{the hurricane}}.|$|E
5|$|In the Windward Islands, {{lightning}} caused two indirect {{deaths in}} Trinidad. Chantal dropped light to moderate rainfall across its path, most significantly in Quintana Roo in Mexico where it caused widespread mudslides. Damage <b>in</b> <b>Belize</b> totaled $4million (2001USD; $ USD), {{due to the}} combined impact of high waves, moderate winds, and rainfall. Overall damage was minor.|$|E
5|$|Offshore islands <b>in</b> <b>Belize</b> {{reported}} {{winds of}} up to 60mph (95km/h). Edith produced flooding in a few towns in the southern portion of the country, with some buildings damaged. Heavy damage was reported near Monkey River Town. Impact in Mexico, if any, is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Taking {{a similar}} path to Hurricane Fifi four years prior, Greta {{threatened}} {{to reproduce the}} devastating effects of the catastrophic storm; however, damage and loss of life was significantly less than feared. In Honduras, about 1,200homes were damaged, about half of which in towns along the coastline. The storm damaged about 75% of the houses on Roatán along the offshore Bay Islands, {{and there was one}} death in the country. In the Belize Barrier Reef, Greta downed trees and produced high waves, while on the mainland, there was minimal flooding despite a high storm surge. In Dangriga where it made landfall, the hurricane damaged or destroyed 125houses and the primary hospital. <b>In</b> <b>Belize</b> City, a tornado flipped over a truck and damaged four houses. Damage <b>in</b> <b>Belize</b> was estimated at $25million (1978USD), and there were four deaths.|$|E

It was reported for the first time from the Russian Far East in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Despite Dean's {{significant}} damage, it did {{not have}} severe effects on infrastructure, and the non-agricultural sectors of most affected nations recovered quickly. Most cruise lines diverted their ships away from the Western Caribbean in anticipation of Hurricane Dean's passage, though by August 27 all were back on schedule, except those with damaged ports <b>in</b> <b>Belize</b> and the Yucatán. The Lesser Antilles and the Greater Antilles were especially quick to resume servicing cruise lines, as their ports opened within days.|$|E

5|$|Following Carmen's passage, {{officials}} {{feared the}} worst for {{an area of}} 1,000mi2 (2,590km2) where communication was lost <b>in</b> <b>Belize.</b> A reconnaissance task force was sent out from Belize City the day after Carmen made landfall to assist any residents stranded by the storm. One person was killed {{off the coast of}} Belize after being washed off his boat by large swells produced by Carmen. Three other fishermen were listed as missing following similar incidents.

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{breeding}} biology of the black catbird.
