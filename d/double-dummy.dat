Every person in the room was engaged at whist except Mrs. Flounce, who still remained quiescent behind her tea and cakes. It did not happen that the party was made up of a number of exact fours. There were two over; two middle-aged ladies, a maiden and a widow: and they, perhaps more happy than any of the others, certainly more silent for neither of them had a partner to scold, were hard at work at <b>double-dummy</b> in a corner.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Double-dummy</b> {{bridge is}} not simply win/lose/draw and not exactly zero-sum, but constant-sum since two playing sides compete for 13 tricks. It is trivial to {{transform}} a constant-sum game into a zero-sum game. Moreover, the goal (and the risk management strategy) in general contract bridge depends {{not only on the}} contract but also on the form of tournament. However, since the <b>double-dummy</b> version is deterministic, the goal is simple: one can without loss of generality aim to maximize the number of tricks taken.|$|E
50|$|Efficient <b>double-dummy</b> solvers {{are key to}} {{successful}} bridge-playing programs. Also, {{as the amount of}} computation increases with sample size, techniques such as importance sampling are used to generate sets of samples that are of minimum size but still representative.|$|E

5000|$|Although <b>double-dummy</b> {{bridge is}} in {{practice}} a competition between two generalised players, each [...] "player" [...] controls two {{hands and the}} cards must be played in a correct order that reflects four players. (It makes a difference which of the four hands wins a trick and must lead the next trick.) ...|$|E
50|$|In <b>double-dummy</b> play, it {{is obvious}} that on the play of the A, East can safely throw a spade, as his partner still guards South's 2 menace. However, East cannot see declarer's hand and if he throws the A, then he has been pseudo-squeezed. In another layout, if East throws a spade on the A, South makes the rest of the tricks.|$|E
50|$|An {{experienced}} West {{will try}} to make things as difficult as possible for South so that the correct route to 12 tricks is not certain. Making the key discard before the final winner is cashed will introduce as much ambiguity as possible. Although in <b>double-dummy</b> it is impossible to go wrong, occasionally South will make the wrong decision in competition.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{relatively}} inexpensive to compute [...] "sure winners" [...] in various positions in a <b>double-dummy</b> solver. This information improves the pruning. It {{can be regarded}} as a kind of evaluation function, however while the latter in other games is an approximation {{of the value of the}} position, the former is a definitive lower bound on the value of the position.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the course}} of <b>double-dummy</b> game tree search, one can {{establish}} equivalence classes consisting of cards with apparently equal value in a particular position. Only one card from each equivalence class needs {{to be considered in}} the subtree search, and furthermore, when using a transposition table, equivalence classes can be exploited to improve the hit rate. This has been described as partition search by Matthew Ginsberg.|$|E
50|$|Regardless of bridge robots' {{level of}} play, {{computer}} bridge already {{has changed the}} analysis of the game. Commercially available <b>double-dummy</b> programs can solve bridge problems in which all four hands are known, typically within a fraction of a second. These days, few editors of books and magazines will solely rely on humans to analyse bridge problems before publications. Also, more and more bridge players and coaches utilize computer analysis in the post-mortem of a match.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is common}} to go two steps further with Crowhurst. First, a suit {{combination}} is a two-person zero-sum game. That means the two defenders play as one; they are of one mind. They know each other's cards and thereby, knowing the dummy, they know declarer's hand too. (That particular is properly called <b>double-dummy</b> defense.) One plan governs both their plays. If they choose to randomize their plays (see [...] "Mixed strategy" [...] below), {{they are able to}} randomize together.|$|E
50|$|While {{bridge is}} a game of {{incomplete}} information, a <b>double-dummy</b> solver analyses a simplified version of the game where there is perfect information; the bidding is ignored, the contract (trump suit and declarer) is given, and all players are assumed to know all cards from the very start. The solver can therefore use many of the game tree search techniques typically used in solving two-player perfect-information win/lose/draw games such as chess, go and reversi. However, there are some significant differences.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous {{strategy}} games {{have been proven}} hard in a complexity class, meaning that any problem in that complexity class can be reduced in polynomial time to that problem. For example, generalized [...] chess has been proven -complete (both in [...] and -hard), effectively meaning that it is among the hardest problems in [...] However, {{since there is no}} natural structure to exploit in <b>double-dummy</b> bridge towards a hardness proof or disproof, unlike in a board game, the question of hardness remains.|$|E
50|$|At {{least since}} Crowhurst (1964), the {{analysis}} of suit combinations routinely makes further simplifications along the same lines. Most fundamental, the play of any suit combination is a zero-sum game. In effect, the two sides agree on {{the relation of the}} suit to the entire hand so that their opposite entire objectives reduce to opposite objectives in the suit. (The <b>double-dummy</b> nature of the defense, below, makes this an important unexplored objective.*) The bottom line is that their opposite objectives can be expressed {{in terms of the number}} of tricks won and lost in the featured suit.|$|E
40|$|Compared {{to other}} games, {{particularly}} chess, {{the research in}} computer bridge is immature, and the best bridge-playing programs are mediocre. In this paper we {{address the problem of}} designing a fast <b>double-dummy</b> bridge game (i. e., a simplified bridge game with perfect information) solver. Although th size of the game tree we generated for searching the best line of play is huge (about on the order of 13 ! Δ 2 39 10 21, even if we assume the average branching factor for players to follow suit is just 2), we show that, through varieties of searching techniques and some efficient moves ordering and pruning heuristics, most <b>double-dummy</b> bridge hands can be solved within a reasonable amount of time.

40|$|Abstract. The game of Bridge {{provides}} {{a number of}} research areas to AI researchers due to the many components that constitute the game.

Declarer play can be accomplished through planning and inference.

40|$|ObjectivesWe prospectively {{assessed}} cardiac and pulmonary {{function in}} patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) treated with ticagrelor, clopidogrel, or placebo in the ONSET/OFFSET (A Multi-Centre Randomised, Double-Blind, <b>Double-Dummy</b> Parallel Group Study of the Onset and Offset of Antiplatelet Effects of AZD 6140 Compared With Clopidogrel and Placebo With Aspirin as Background Therapy in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease) study. BackgroundTicagrelor reduces cardiovascular events more effectively than clopidogrel {{in patients with}} acute coronary syndromes. Dyspnea develops in some patients treated with ticagrelor, {{and it is not}} known whether this is associated with changes in cardiac or pulmonary function. MethodsIn all, 123 stable aspirin-treated CAD patients randomly received either ticagrelor (180 mg load, then 90 mg twice daily; n = 57), clopidogrel (600 mg load, then 75 mg daily; n = 54), or placebo (n = 12) for 6 weeks in a double-blind, <b>double-dummy</b> design. Electrocardiography, echocardiography, serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and pulmonary function tests were performed before (baseline) and 6 weeks after drug administration and/or after development of dyspnea. ResultsAfter drug administration, dyspnea was reported by 38. 6 %, 9. 3 %, and 8. 3 % of patients in the ticagrelor, clopidogrel, and placebo groups, respectively (p < 0. 001). Most instances were mild and/or lasted < 24 h, although 3 patients discontinued ticagrelor because of dyspnea. Eight of 22 and 17 of 22 ticagrelor-treated patients experiencing dyspnea did so within 24 h and 1 week, respectively, after drug administration. In all treatment groups, and in ticagrelor-treated patients with dyspnea, there were no significant changes between baseline and 6 weeks in any of the cardiac or pulmonary function parameters.
