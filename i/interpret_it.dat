5|$|The {{cause of}} Smart's eclipse may be traced {{in part to}} a {{prejudice}} of the age, one which was founded in reason but developed in fear. There was one inescapable fact which hampered any clear perception of Smart's work—he had been confined for madness. It was easier to use a difficult allusion or unusual image as evidence of madness than to <b>interpret</b> <b>it.</b> What could cause a fundamentally rational group of people to react so irrationally? To some degree, it was the fear of 'enthusiasm'.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Troilus' romance {{developed}} {{within the context}} of the male-centred conventions of courtly love and thus the focus of sympathy was to be Troilus and not his beloved. As different authors recreated the romance, they would <b>interpret</b> <b>it</b> in ways affected both by the perspectives of their own times and their individual preoccupations. The story as it would later develop through the works of Boccaccio, Chaucer and Shakespeare is summarised below.|$|E
5|$|Extraterrestrial {{technology}} could have profound {{impacts on the}} nature of human culture and civilization. Just as television provided a new outlet {{for a wide variety of}} political, religious, and social groups, and as the printing press made the Bible available to the common people of Europe, allowing them to <b>interpret</b> <b>it</b> for themselves, so an extraterrestrial technology might change humanity in ways not immediately apparent. Harrison speculates that a knowledge of extraterrestrial technologies could increase the gap between scientific and cultural progress, leading to societal shock and an inability to compensate for negative effects of technology. He gives the example of improvements in agricultural technology during the Industrial Revolution, which displaced thousands of farm laborers until society could retrain them for jobs suited to the new social order. Contact with an extraterrestrial civilization far more advanced than humanity could cause a much greater shock than the Industrial Revolution, or anything previously experienced by humanity.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, {{the sword}} of the snout can hardly refer to the horns of a bull, {{but it is more}} natural to <b>interpret</b> <b>it</b> as the tusks of a boar. In English, the lines can be {{translated}} as but the giant beast coloured its tusk red on Egil.|$|E
25|$|Some {{commentators}} on the Aganna-Sutta {{from the}} Pāli Canon, {{a record of}} the teachings of Gautama Buddha, <b>interpret</b> <b>it</b> as showing women as responsible for the downfall of the human race. However, Buddhist interpretation is generally that it shows lust in general, rather than women, as causing the downfall.|$|E

5000|$|Children, {{teenagers}} and a teacher's assistant have occasionally been punished or removed from school {{for making the}} gesture. In some cases this was because authority figures <b>interpreted</b> <b>it</b> as a signal for threatening real violence, while in others they <b>interpreted</b> <b>it</b> as unacceptably supportive of gun violence in general. [...] These have often been labeled [...] "ridiculous" [...] by some commentators.|$|R
25|$|Epigraphic {{evidence}} {{for the use of}} the Old Hungarian script in medieval Hungary dates to the 10th century, for example, from Homokmégy The latter inscription was found on a fragment of a quiver made of bone. Although there have been several attempts to <b>interpret</b> <b>it,</b> the meaning of it is still unclear.|$|E
25|$|As {{the site}} has {{suffered}} from looting and amateur excavations since shortly after Tiwanaku's fall, archeologists must attempt to <b>interpret</b> <b>it</b> {{with the understanding that}} materials have been jumbled and destroyed. This destruction continued during the Spanish conquest and colonial period, and during 19th century and the early 20th century. Other damage was committed by people quarrying stone for building and railroad construction, and target practice by military personnel.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} mass media on attitudes toward intellect are {{certainly}} multiple and ambiguous. On the one hand, mass communications greatly expand {{the sheer volume of}} information available for public consumption. On the other hand, much of this information comes pre-interpreted for easy digestion and laden with hidden assumption, saving consumers the work of having to <b>interpret</b> <b>it</b> for themselves. Commodified information naturally tends to reflect the assumptions and interests of those who produce it, and its producers are not driven entirely by a passion to promote critical reflection.|$|E

25|$|There {{were three}} consonants, the voiced dental fricative, voiced palato-alveolar affricate, and voiceless palato-alveolar affricate, which Genie did not spontaneously {{pronounce}} until 1973 and only inconsistently pronounced after that time. Until 1973, instead of pronouncing alveolar lateral approximants and retroflex approximants as separate sounds she articulated both {{in a manner}} that Curtiss described as a sound somewhere in between. Genie would also typically, although not always, simplify or delete consonant clusters. The one regular exception was that a rhotic approximant almost always remained intact because Genie seemed to <b>interpret</b> <b>it</b> {{as a part of the}} preceding vowel.|$|E
25|$|Many {{thousands}} of years later, human civilization has gone through many Rebirths, or Renaissances. The chance infusion of a mentality from 1949 through a freak combination of the active mode of the Dirac within a radio telescope results in the formation, after many adventures and an ultimate resurgence of Man, of the Quint, the Autarch of Rebirth V. A computer of this far future time uses the Dirac as both a means of communication and infinite memory storage (Midsummer Century). Its existence was foretold {{at the time of}} Capt. Weinbaum (in The Quincunx of Time), though no-one could <b>interpret</b> <b>it</b> then.|$|E
25|$|Énée then rushes {{on to tell}} of the devouring of {{the priest}} Laocoön by a sea serpent, after he had warned the Trojans to burn the horse. Énée interprets this {{as a sign of}} the goddess Athene's anger at the sacrilege. Against Cassandre's futile protests, Priam orders the horse to be brought within the city of Troy and placed next to the temple of Pallas Athene. There is a sound of what seems to be the clashing of arms from within the horse, but the Trojans, in their delusion, <b>interpret</b> <b>it</b> as a happy omen. Cassandre has watched the {{procession}} in despair, and as the act ends, resigns herself to death beneath the walls of Troy.|$|E

25|$|However, Robert D. Hare, a {{psychologist}} working in criminology, developed an influential Psychopathy Checklist {{based on the}} psychopath construct developed by Cleckley. Later two items {{were removed from the}} checklist in order to more clearly represent the structure of a two-factor analysis. Grandiosity, impulsivity and juvenile delinquency were not in Cleckley's criteria but were put into Hare's, who left out Cleckley's core criteria of no significant irrational thinking or anxiety. Hare has written that The Mask of Sanity has such detailed and complex descriptions and speculations that it can support a variety of different interpretations. He suggests it is necessary to <b>interpret</b> <b>it</b> with supporting evidence, though notes that it has virtually no empirical data to enable this.|$|E
25|$|In reality, {{the nature}} of Turing's death {{is a matter of}} {{considerable}} debate. The chemical castration period ended fourteen months before his death. The official inquest into his death ruled that he had committed suicide by consuming a cyanide-laced apple. Turing biographer Andrew Hodges believes the death was indeed a suicide, re-enacting the poisoned apple from Snow White, Turing's favourite fairy tale, with some deliberate ambiguity included to permit Turing's mother to <b>interpret</b> <b>it</b> as an accident. However, Jack Copeland, an editor of volumes of Turing's work and Director of the Turing Archive for the History of Computing, has suggested that Turing's death may have been accidental, caused by the cyanide fumes produced by an experiment in his spare room, and that the investigation was poorly conducted.|$|E
25|$|Another {{dominant}} {{message that}} was found in Protestant propaganda {{was the idea that}} every person should be granted access to the Bible to <b>interpret</b> <b>it</b> for themselves; this was the primary reason why Luther translated and published numerous copies of the New Testament during the Reformation years. Protestants questioned the belief that the Pope had the sole authority to interpret scripture. This can be seen in Luther’s publication titled To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, which criticized the Catholic belief that the Pope was supreme and could interpret scripture however he saw fit. To combat this, Luther put forth arguments from the Bible that indicated that everyone had the ability to interpret scripture and not just the Pope.|$|E

25|$|In epistemology, for example, the {{criticism}} of what Fodor calls the interpretationalist hypothesis accounts for the common-sense intuition (on which naïve physics is based) of the independence of reality from the conceptual categories of the experimenter. If the processes of elaboration of the mental modules are in fact independent of the background theories, then {{it is possible to}} maintain the realist view that two scientists who embrace two radically diverse theories see the world exactly in the same manner even if they <b>interpret</b> <b>it</b> differently. The point is {{that it is necessary to}} distinguish between observations and the perceptual fixation of beliefs. While it is beyond doubt that the second process involves the holistic relationship between beliefs, the first is largely independent of the background beliefs of individuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrine}} of Maya {{is used to}} explain the empirical reality in Advaita. Jiva, when conditioned by the human mind, is subjected to experiences of a subjective nature, states Vedanta school, which leads it to misunderstand Maya and <b>interpret</b> <b>it</b> as the sole and final reality. Advaitins assert that the perceived world, including people and other existence, {{is not what it}} appears to be". It is Māyā, they assert, which manifests and perpetuates a sense of false duality or divisional plurality. The empirical manifestation is real but changing, but it obfuscates the true nature of metaphysical Reality which is never changing. Advaita school holds that liberation is the unfettered realization and understanding of the unchanging Reality and truths – the Self, that the Self (Soul) in oneself is same as the Self in another and the Self in everything (Brahman).|$|E
25|$|The Jefferson-Wayles {{descendants}} {{and most}} historians denied for nearly 200 {{years that he}} was the father of Hemings' children. Since the mid-20th century, there have been challenges to that denial, as historians have re-examined some of the evidence and thought to <b>interpret</b> <b>it</b> differently. Disagreements have arisen since the late 20th century over how to interpret historical evidence related to the issue. According to an 1868 letter by Jefferson biographer Henry Randall to the historian James Parton, Jefferson's grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, said that Jefferson's surviving daughter Martha stated on her deathbed that Jefferson had been away from Monticello for 15 months before one of Hemings' children was born, so could not be the father. But historian Dumas Malone later documented that Jefferson had been at Monticello nine months before the birth of each of Hemings' children.|$|E
