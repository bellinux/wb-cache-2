5|$|Levels in {{the console}} {{versions}} of Underground were significantly {{larger than those}} of earlier Tony Hawk's games. Neversoft expanded each level until it ceased to run correctly, then shrunk it slightly. Most of the levels were modelled closely after real-world locations; the designers traveled to locales representative of each city {{in the game and}} took photographs and videos as reference. The New Jersey level was a replication of a neighborhood where team artist Henry Ji had grown up as a young skater. Neversoft wanted the player to become familiar with the basic game mechanics quickly and to notice Undergrounds differences from previous Tony Hawk's titles immediately. To accomplish this, they introduced the ability to travel on foot, and the ability to climb along ledges in the first few missions of the game. While Neversoft wanted to keep Underground realistic and relatable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>part,</b> <b>they</b> added driving side-missions as an enjoyable diversion and to push the boundaries of freedom in skateboarding games. However, these missions were intended not to take away from the main experience of skateboarding.|$|E
5|$|Using {{draconian}} drills {{that required}} officers to place atebrin tablets in their men's mouths, the army attempted {{to reduce the}} incidence of malaria to zero. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>part</b> <b>they</b> were successful but in the Aitape-Wewak campaign the 6th Division suffered an epidemic of malaria despite its best efforts. Fairley was urgently recalled from a tour of South East Asia Command and given orders by General Blamey to personally proceed to Wewak and investigate the situation. A special section was formed from the LHQ Medical Research Unit to assist the 6th Division and certain relapsing personnel were evacuated to Cairns. The epidemic was ultimately brought under control by doubling the dosage of atebrin. Fairley was forced to confront the fact—confirmed by research at Cairns—that an atebrin resistant strain of malaria had arisen. The ability of malaria to develop resistant strains would have profound implications in the post-war world.|$|E
5|$|The {{aim of the}} {{operation}} was to facilitate the withdrawal of PLAN combatants. South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha confined all South African troops to their base for 60 hours, allowing SWAPO guerillas {{to leave the country}} unhindered. Nine assembly points were established by the UN, with up to twelve soldiers and five military observers at each. Six of the assembly points (APs) were led by Australians: Captain Richard Bradshaw (contingent signals officer) at AP Charlie (Ruacana), Sergeant Kerry Ponting (Squadron workshop) at AP Foxtrot (Oshikango), Captain Mark Hender (Squadron Operations Officer) at AP Juliet (Okankolo), Lieutenant Stephen Alexander (Field troop commander) at AP Delta (Beacon 7, west of Oshikango), Lieutenant Mark Broome (Plant Troop Officer) AP Bravo (Ruacana) and Lieutenant Pat Sowry (Liaison Officer) AP Kilo (Oshikuku). Most of the assembly points had intense media scrutiny. The intention of {{the operation}} was for PLAN combatants to assemble at these points. They would then be escorted across the border north to the 16th parallel to their bases of confinement, but the operation was unsuccessful. Very few PLAN combatants passed through these points; <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>part,</b> <b>they</b> withdrew across the border by walking independently. It was estimated that 200 to 400 PLAN members remained in Namibia, absorbed into the local community. Agreement was subsequently reached in late April that the SADF personnel be restricted to their bases from 26 April; in effect, hostilities ended after that date.|$|E

25|$|The {{remaining}} animals form a monophyletic {{group called}} the Bilateria. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>part,</b> <b>they</b> are bilaterally symmetric, and often have a specialized head with feeding and sensory organs. The body is triploblastic, i.e. all three germ layers are well-developed, and tissues form distinct organs. The digestive chamber has two openings, a mouth and an anus, {{and there is also}} an internal body cavity called a coelom or pseudocoelom. There are exceptions to each of these characteristics, however—for instance adult echinoderms are radially symmetric, and certain parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures.|$|E

25|$|The Asian tiger {{mosquito}} particularly bites in forests during the day, so {{has been known}} as the forest day mosquito. Depending upon region and biotype, activity peaks differ, but <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>part,</b> <b>they</b> rest during the morning and night hours. They search for their hosts {{inside and outside of}} human dwellings, but are particularly active outside. The size of the blood meal depends upon the size of the mosquito, but it is usually around 2 μl. Their bites are not necessarily painful, but they are more noticeable than those from other kinds of mosquitoes. Tiger mosquitoes generally tend to bite a human host more than once if they are able to.|$|E
25|$|All {{segments}} {{shared the}} common elements of thrust faulting with {{a component of}} left-lateral slip, a general east-west strike and a northward dip, {{but they were not}} unified with regard to their connection to the associated underlying bedrock. The initial surveyors of the extensive faulting in the valley, foothills, and mountains reported only tectonic faulting, while excluding fissures and other features that arose from the effects of compaction and landsliding. In the vicinity of the Sylmar Fault segment, there was a low possibility of landslides {{due to a lack of}} elevation change, but in the foothills and mountainous area a large amount of landsliding occurred and more work was necessary to eliminate the possibility of misidentifying a feature. Along the hill fronts of the Tujunga segment some ambiguous formations were present because some scarps may have had influence from downhill motion, but <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>part</b> <b>they</b> were tectonic in nature.|$|E

500|$|Epworth's bass-oriented {{production}} was key {{to creating a}} universally appealing album and was also used as a musical background to the lyrics. Okereke has explained that the songs were crafted to balance dark lyrics with uplifting melodies. He called {{the final version of}} Silent Alarm [...] "technicolour" [...] due to its stylistic choices and indicated that Bloc Party achieved the aim of making the songs sound [...] "better and bigger" [...] when they were recorded in the studio. [...] Moakes later pointed out that the band members were relative novices when they entered the recording sessions, and that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>part</b> <b>they</b> only did what they were advised; this is an additional reason why the album is disjunct and not focused on any particular musical style.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the death}} during {{childbirth}} of Kent's wife, Elizabeth Lynes, he became romantically involved with her sister, Fanny. [...] Canon law prevented the couple from marrying, but they nevertheless moved to London and lodged at {{the property in}} Cock Lane, then owned by Parsons. [...] Several accounts of strange knocking sounds and ghostly apparitions were reported, although <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>part</b> <b>they</b> stopped after the couple moved out, but following Fanny's death from smallpox and Kent's successful legal action against Parsons over an outstanding debt, they resumed. [...] Parsons claimed that Fanny's ghost haunted his property and later his daughter. [...] Regular séances were held to determine [...] "Scratching Fanny's" [...] motives; Cock Lane was often made impassable by the throngs of interested bystanders.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} methods by which common {{starlings}} obtain their food but <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>part,</b> <b>they</b> forage {{close to the}} ground, taking insects from the surface or just underneath. Generally, common starlings prefer foraging amongst short-cropped grasses and are often found among grazing animals or perched on their backs, where they will also feed on the mammal's external parasites. Large flocks may engage in a practice known as [...] "roller-feeding", where the birds {{at the back of}} the flock continually fly to the front where the feeding opportunities are best. The larger the flock, the nearer individuals are to one another while foraging. Flocks often feed in one place for some time, and return to previous successfully foraged sites.|$|E
