In this context, an original approach for generating machining process based on machining knowledge is proposed in this paper. The core {{of this approach is}} to decompose a CAD model of complex <b>forging</b> <b>die</b> in geometric features. Technological data and topological relations are aggregated to a geometric feature in order to create machining features. Technological data, such as material, surface roughness and form tolerance are defined during <b>forging</b> process and <b>dies</b> design. These data are used to choose cutting tools and machining strategies. Topological relations define relative positions between the surfaces of the die CAD model. After machining features identification cutting tools and machining strategies currently used in HSM of <b>forging</b> <b>die,</b> are associated to them in order to generate machining sequences. A machining process model is proposed to formalize the links between information imbedded in the machining features and the parameters of cutting tools and machining strategies.

Geometrical features identification is based on machining knowledge formalization which is translated in the generation of maps from STL models.
