50|$|A 1997 {{study at}} South Georgia {{indicated}} that several thousand Antarctic fur seals were entangled in man-made debris from fishing vessels. Consequently, CCAMLR campaigned for compliance with MARPOL provisions relating to waste disposal at sea, and for cutting of any material jettisoned which could <b>form</b> <b>collars</b> to entangle seals. Subsequent monitoring of entangled fur seals confirmed that entanglement {{is still a}} persistent problem, but it has halved in recent years. However, the South Georgia fur seal population has approximately doubled in the same period, so that the overall total of animals entangled may even have increased. The particular reduction in entanglement due to packing bands {{and the fact that}} all such bands washed ashore over the last 2 years have been cut, does suggest a general improvement in standards of waste disposal on Southern Ocean fishing vessels.|$|R
50|$|It can be {{distinguished}} from the similar looking Lithospermum bejariense by having shorter corollas (6-10mm) and nutlets that <b>form</b> a <b>collar</b> around the base. It can {{be distinguished}} from the cedar glade endemic Lithospermum molle by having leaves with erect pustular-based hairs. Some rare collections from southern Kentucky appear to be intermediate with Lithospermum molle.|$|R

A few species, such as Saccoglossus kowalevskii, lack even the planktonic larval stage, hatching directly as miniature adults.|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} model of axisymmetric convection {{in the presence}} of a vertical magnetic flux bundle and rotation about the axis is presented. The model contains a compressible plasma described by the non-linear MHD equations, with density and temperature gradients simulating the upper layer of the Sunâ€™s convection zone. The solutions exhibit a central magnetic flux tube in a cylindrical numerical domain, with convection cells <b>forming</b> <b>collar</b> flows around the tube. When the numerical domain is rotated with a constant angular velocity, the plasma forms a Rankine vortex, with the plasma rotating as a rigid body where the magnetic field is strong, as in the flux tube, while experiencing sheared azimuthal flow in the surrounding convection cells, forming a free vortex. As a result, the azimuthal velocity component has its maximum value close to the outer edge of the flux tube. The azimuthal flow inside the magnetic flux tube and the vortex flow is prograde relative to the rotating cylindrical reference frame. A retrograde flow appears at the outer wall. The most significant convection cell outside the flux tube is the location for the maximum value of the azimuthal magnetic field component. The azimuthal flow and magnetic structure are not generated spontaneously, but decay exponentially in the absence of any imposed rotation of the cylindrical domain...|$|R

50|$|A simpler {{variant of}} the {{standard}} polo neck is the mock polo neck (or mock turtleneck), that resembles the polo neck with the soft fold at its top {{and the way it}} stands up around the neck, but both ends of the tube <b>forming</b> the <b>collar</b> are sewn to the neckline. This is mainly used to achieve the appearance of a polo neck where the fabric would fray, roll, or otherwise behave badly unless sewn. The mock polo neck clings to the neck smoothly, is easy to manufacture, and works well with a zip closure.|$|R

50|$|Both WC-1 and WC-2 have PAS domains {{that allow}} them to bind to other proteins. WC-1 and WC-2 {{typically}} heterodimerize in vivo to <b>form</b> the White <b>Collar</b> Complex (WCC), which acts as a transcription factor complex. In vitro, WC-1 can also homodimerize with itself and heterodimerize with other PAS proteins.|$|R
40|$|A study {{conducted}} at South Georgia in 1988 / 1989 indicated that several thousand Antarctic fur seals were entangled mainly in man-made material originating from fishing vessels. Consequently, the authority {{responsible for the}} management of Southern Ocean marine resources (CCAMLR) actively campaigned for compliance with the MARPOL provisions relating to waste disposal at sea, and for cutting of any material unavoidably jettisoned which could <b>form</b> <b>collars</b> to entangle seals. Five subsequent years of recording entangled fur seals confirms that entanglement is a persistent problem, although its incidence has been halved in recent years. However, the South Georgia fur seal population has approximately doubled in the same period, so that the overall total of animals entangled may even have increased. Nevertheless, because most seals entangled are juvenile males, the current rate of entanglement will have negligible effects on the reproductive rate of the South Georgia population, especially in relation to its current rate of population increase. The reduction in observed entanglement incidence cannot be attributed mainly to improved waste disposal practices because it has coincided with substantial reductions in fishing activity around South Georgia. However, the particular reduction in entanglement due to packing bands and the fact that all such bands washed ashore over the last 2 years have been cut, does suggest a general improvement in standards of waste disposal on Southern Ocean fishing vessel...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the development of}} multiple septa in elongated multinucleated cells (hyphae) of the filamentous ascomycete Ashbya gossypii in which septation is apparently uncoupled from nuclear cycles. A key player for this compartmentalization is the PCH protein Hof 1. Hyphae that are lacking this protein form neither actin rings nor septa but still elongate at wild-type speed. Using in vivo fluorescence microscopy, we present {{for the first time}} the coordination of cytokinesis and septation in multiseptated and multinucleated cells. Hof 1, the type II myosin Myo 1, the landmark protein Bud 3, and the IQGAP Cyk 1 <b>form</b> <b>collars</b> of cortical bars already adjacent to hyphal tips, thereby marking the sites of septation. While hyphae continue to elongate, these proteins gradually form cortical rings. This bar-to-ring transition depends on Hof 1 and Cyk 1 but not Myo 1 and is required for actin ring assembly. The Fes/CIP 4 homology (FCH) domain of Hof 1 ensures efficient localization of Hof 1, whereas ring integrity is conferred by the Src homology 3 (SH 3) domain. Up to several hours after site selection, actin ring contraction leads to membrane invagination and subsequent cytokinesis. Simultaneously, a septum forms between the adjacent hyphal compartments, which do not separate. During evolution, A. gossypii lost the homologs of two enzymes essential for cell separation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae...|$|R
