5|$|Poison {{was given}} a {{secondary}} outfit for Capcom Fighting All-Stars alongside her primary classic attire. Made of shiny, silvery material it consisted of boots that extended <b>halfway</b> <b>up</b> her thighs and a combined sleeveless shirt/short skirt with a plunging neckline. Gloves and a small hairband were also added, {{as well as a}} belt, with the handcuffs hanging off of it. Her arm straps were removed, though the strap around her neck remained.|$|E
5|$|Styracosaurus {{and other}} horned dinosaurs are often {{depicted}} {{in popular culture}} as herd animals. A bonebed composed of Styracosaurus remains is known from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, about <b>halfway</b> <b>up</b> the formation. This bonebed is associated with different types of river deposits. The mass deaths {{may have been a}} result of otherwise non-herding animals congregating around a waterhole in a period of drought, with evidence suggesting the environment may have been seasonal and semiarid.|$|E

5|$|The first {{buildings}} in Hadar were constructed {{at the start}} of the 20th century. Hadar was Haifa's cultural center and marketplace throughout the 1920s and into the 1980s, nestled above and around Haifa's Arab neighborhoods. Today Hadar stretches from the port area near the bay, approximately <b>halfway</b> <b>up</b> Mount Carmel, around the German Colony, Wadi Nisnas and Wadi Salib. Hadar houses two commercial centers (one in the port area, and one midway up the mountain) surrounded by some of the city's older neighborhoods.|$|E
5|$|The first toothless {{ancestors}} of Mysticetes {{appeared before the}} first radiation in the late Oligocene. Eomysticetus {{and others like it}} showed no evidence in the skull of echolocation abilities, suggesting they mainly relied on their eyesight for navigation. The eomysticetes had long, flat rostra that lacked teeth and had blowholes located <b>halfway</b> <b>up</b> the dorsal side of the snout. Though the palate is not well-preserved in these specimens, they are thought to have had baleen and been filter feeders. Miocene baleen whales were preyed upon by larger predators like killer sperm whales and Megalodon.|$|E
5|$|The {{bell tower}} rises , and <b>halfway</b> <b>up</b> its length {{is a large}} round sign. The sign denotes the school district, Pine Rock, and {{the year of the}} school's foundation. Originally, the sign graced the front {{exterior}} wall of the larger of the two rooms. The tower rises above the roof by about fifteen feet and at its top are four arches, one on each side. Wooden construction is found throughout the tower, its arches, {{and the rest of the}} schoolhouse, save the limestone and cement foundation. At the bottom of each of the four arches are balustrades decorated with spindles. Inside the tower is the school bell. The bell house is topped with a multi-gabled roof. The roof of the overall schoolhouse is covered with cedar shingles and features chimneys rising from each of the classrooms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{causeway}} {{has caused}} ecological problems, most notably accumulation of silt in the Johore Strait. This {{has led to}} disagreements with Malaysia. Singapore has rejected Malaysia's proposal to replace the causeway with a bridge, and Malaysia has since proposed the idea of {{what became known as}} [...] "the crooked half-bridge", descending <b>halfway</b> to link <b>up</b> with the low-level causeway.|$|R
5000|$|Confucius however didn't {{think that}} Ran Qiu's declining {{performance}} {{was due to}} a lack of ability.

25|$|Instead of slowing, George {{kept the}} pace, and Cummings {{struggled}} to keep <b>up.</b> <b>Halfway</b> through the final lap, Cummings gave up and started to walk, and since winning was the main concern today, George slowed to a walk when he was far enough ahead. Cummings, urged by his boosters, started to run again, which caused George to start to run again. He beat Cummings by some 65 yards {{in a time of}} 4:20, remarkably fast given his leisurely last lap.|$|R
5|$|They {{started the}} ascent at 19:00 {{and reached the}} first shelf about two hours later. Here, a field radio was stationed. Later the same evening, they reached the main shelf where the {{aircraft}} body lay. Although finding the remaining bodies, the team only salvaged some post, concluding {{that it would be}} too difficult for them to take down the bodies. They were down again at 01:30. At 10:00 on 20 June, the team again ascended the mountain. Bernt Porten climbed <b>halfway</b> <b>up</b> at least a dozen times, taking water up and bringing down bodies wrapped in tarpaulin. All three bodies and the climbers were down again at 21:00.|$|E
5|$|Zheng and Shuying {{returned}} to Putian where Huang Na {{was buried in}} a tomb <b>halfway</b> <b>up</b> a mountain near their house. While alive, Huang Na had asked that her surname be changed to her stepfather's, so her altar tablet bore the name Zheng Na. The couple decided to focus on raising their remaining child, with Zheng planning to pursue business opportunities in Guangzhou or Shenzhen. In January 2007, Jack Neo considered making a movie about the murder, but both families objected. A follow-up report in 2009 found that Shuying {{had given birth to}} another two children and was running a shoe distribution business in Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{have great}} powers of {{regeneration}} and can reproduce asexually, by budding, fragmentation, or by longitudinal or transverse binary fission. Some {{species such as}} certain Anthopleura divide longitudinally, pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and markings. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing <b>halfway</b> <b>up</b> the column before it splits horizontally. Some species can also reproduce by pedal laceration. In this process, a ring of material may break off from the pedal disc {{at the base of}} the column which then fragments, the pieces regenerating into new clonal individuals. Alternatively, fragments detach separately as the animal creeps across a surface. In Metridium dianthus, fragmentation rates were higher in individuals living among live mussels than among dead shells, and all the new individuals had tentacles within three weeks.|$|E
50|$|The last scene shows Sethee in {{hospital}} being operated on, he is unconscious but suddenly Dararai's ghost appears {{and it turns}} out her ghost wasn't part of Sethees mental mind but was real and was manipulating Sethee. She finally reveals that she forgives him and after clicking her fingers his mind goes back to normal but this makes Sethee conscious again and wakes him <b>up</b> <b>halfway</b> through his operation leaving him screaming in pain as Dararai disappears and the ending credits show.|$|R
5000|$|A dull {{summer is}} {{improved}} when Katharine, Mark, Jane and Martha find a magical coin-like talisman. The catch {{is that it}} grants half of any wish made by its bearer—a wish {{to be on a}} desert island sends them to the Sahara desert, and their mother ends <b>up</b> <b>halfway</b> home when she wishes to return home during a dull visit to her relatives. That [...] "half magic" [...] is a challenge, sometimes comical, until the children learn to double their wishes.|$|R
2500|$|Task Review: Impact had a slow start, {{but soon}} {{attracted}} customers, particularly younger ones when Paul {{was given a}} bear costume to wear, with the team working well and securing a sale just before closing time. Meanwhile, First Forte had difficulties, as Adele was openly rude to the Harrods staff on several occasions, and then gave <b>up</b> <b>halfway</b> through the task upon learning that Impact had a strong lead. Despite rallying well with the task later in the day, the problems from her, Ben's weak performance, and Impact's last minute sale, effectively ended any chance of a win.|$|R
5|$|Variance in {{recovered}} phylogenetic {{positions for}} Eolambia persisted in following years. In the 2009 description of Levnesovia, Hans-Dieter Sues and Alexander Averianov found that Protohadros occupied an intermediate position relative to Altirhinus and Probactrosaurus, being the sister group of Fukuisaurus (results reproduced below). Meanwhile, {{in accordance with}} the results of Horner and colleagues, Albert Prieto-Márquez and Mark Norell found in 2010 that Eolambia was instead the sister group of Protohadros. He also noted features of Eolambia that were convergent upon hadrosaurids: the presence of a single tooth carina; the nearly-square outer corner of the predentary; and the midpoint of the quadratojugal notch (which articulates with the quadratojugal) being located roughly <b>halfway</b> <b>up</b> the surface of the quadrate (being located less than 60% of the bone's height down from the top). In 2012, Holtz classified Eolambia as a primitive member of the Styracosterna along with Altirhinus.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} many minor {{problems}} all WindSeekers had in 2011, the first major accident occurred on June 2, 2012, on the Cedar Point installation. According to numerous news and rider reports, WindSeeker operated normally as the gondola made its way up the tower. Attached to the tower and gondola are a set of electrical cables that are located inside a plastic casing and are secured by two side panels to prevent the cables from moving around. At {{the top of the}} tower, winds were reportedly strong enough to push the electrical cables out of the socket on the tower causing the cables to move around freely. According to a rider riding WindSeeker {{at the time of the}} accident, as the gondola made its way back down the tower, the cables got stuck in the rotating gondola. The plastic casing began to be ripped apart as well as the cables causing the ride to come to a complete stop just over <b>halfway</b> <b>up</b> the tower. Because the electrical cables had been damaged, Cedar Point employees had to manually bring down the gondola. Riders were stuck on the ride for over an hour and no one was injured. WindSeeker at Cedar Point remained closed until the cause of the accident was found and fixed. The ride reopened on June 5, 2012.|$|E
5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because {{they thought it was}} a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was <b>halfway</b> <b>up</b> the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, William Grady Sims, {{mayor of}} Walnut Grove since 1981, was {{appointed}} by the Mississippi Department of Corrections {{as director of the}} independent Walnut Grove Transition Center, despite his lack of any correctional facility experience. This <b>halfway</b> house for <b>up</b> to 150 prisoners, both male and female, was set up in buildings that MDOC leased from Cecil McCrory, a businessman, consultant to numerous prison management and related companies, and former state legislator. The MODC operated the transition center directly with its own staff. Sims also profited from the revenues of the 18 vending machines he had installed at the youth prison.|$|R
5000|$|Eurogamer {{said of the}} PlayStation 3 version, [...] "Splatterhouse is only {{reasonably}} good at being the classless procession of shock and bad taste that it wants to be." [...] GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd said of the game, [...] "All the gore in the world can't disguise Splatterhouse's laundry list of clumsy mechanics." [...] He criticized the camera, load times, glitches and cheap deaths, but praised the story and the inspired artistic touches. IGN's Arthur Gies said, [...] "Some occasionally slick visuals and funky design are undermined by camera and framerate problems and enemy variety that dries <b>up</b> <b>halfway</b> through." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{brought a}} storm surge of 10–12 ft (3–3.5 m) to Tampa Bay. The highest rainfall total in Tampa was at 8.53 in (23.5 mm). However, the observer noted that winds probably blew {{water out of}} the gauge. The barometric pressure fell to , breaking a previous record set in 1910. The hurricane also brought sustained winds of 75 mph (119 km/h) and a storm tide of 10.5 ft (3 m). Damage from the wind was generally minor, while most of the impact wrought by the storm was due to abnormally high tides in Tampa and elsewhere in the area. Much of the city was flooded, with the worst along Bayshore Boulevard, where some of the most expensive properties were located. At Hyde Park, dwellings were inundated about <b>halfway</b> <b>up</b> the first story, prompting several people to be rescued by boat. Electrical poles and wires were washed away near the intersection of Bayshore Boulevard and Howard Avenue. The latter was also left impassible by car. In the Palmetto Beach neighborhood, much of the section was inundated. A group of about 40 volunteers rescued a number of women and children. A total of 50 homes were destroyed by cedar logs used to construct cigar boxes at the Tampa Box Company on 22nd Street.|$|E
