40|$|<b>Iatrogenic</b> <b>diseases</b> {{are due to}} {{negligence}} or malpractice (Pezza et al., 2008). In human medicine, {{these conditions}} are widely described (Weingart et al., 2000), mostly for insurance issues related to hospitalization, while in veterinary medicine are reported only occasional case reports. 4155 clinical records related to cattle admitted to the Clinic for Ruminants and Swine of the University of Milan between 2005 and 2017 were analyzed. Clinical cases that required admission because of an <b>iatrogenic</b> related <b>disease</b> were selected for this study. For case selection, 3 experienced veterinarians examined the clinical records, cross-compared the selection and pick 114 cases (2, 7 %). The <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>diseases</b> were primarily caused by farmers (93 %) than veterinary practitioner (7 %). <b>Iatrogenic</b> <b>diseases</b> were caused mostly by erroneous administration of drugs (47, 4 %), excessive traction at birth (17, 5 %), improper milk or colostrum administration, frequently performed by oroesophageal tubing (16, 7 %) or by forced administration using a nipple bottle (12, 3 %). As verified by our study, farmers often performs medical, nursing and zootechnical procedures without adequate competences and sometimes choose medical treatment for sick animals without professional consultation of veterinarians. The veterinarian rule is fundamental in farmer education. Clinicians, especially in some professional branches as neonatology, should be more responsible of their assignments, avoiding delegation of specific procedures to unskilled staff. The importance of communication in improving management and health in dairy farms has been recently demonstrated (Jansen and Lam, 2012; Jansen et al., 2010).

5000|$|Professor Levy was {{an outspoken}} critic of Ignaz Semmelweis' ideas, that childbed fever was an <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>disease.</b> Semmelweis theorized that {{decaying}} matter on the hands of doctors, who had recently conducted autopsies, was brought into contact with the genitials of birthgiving women during the medical examinations at the maternity clinic. Semmelweis proposed a radical hand washing theory using chlorinated lime, now a known disinfectant, and demonstrated dramatic reductions in mortality rates. In a rather infamous concluding remark, Professor Levy writes: [...] These are my impressions of Dr. Semmelweis's experiences; for these reasons I must judge provisionally that his opinions are not clear enough and his findings not exact enough to qualify as scientifically founded.|$|E
50|$|The tumor must {{be removed}} with as {{complete}} a surgical excision as possible. In nearly all cases, the ossicular chain must be included if recurrences are to be avoided. Due to the anatomic site of involvement, facial nerve paralysis and/or paresthesias may be seen or develop; this is probably due to mass effect rather than nerve invasion. In a few cases, reconstructive surgery may be required. Since this is a benign tumor, no radiation is required. Patients experience an excellent long term outcome, although recurrences can be seen (up to 15%), especially if the ossicular chain is not removed. Although controversial, metastases are not seen in this tumor. There are reports of disease in the neck lymph nodes, but these patients have also had other diseases or multiple surgeries, such that it may represent <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Semmelweis's key {{claim was}} that {{physicians}} contaminated their hands with [...] "cadaveric particles" [...] {{in the morgue}} while conducting autopsies.

When physicians later carried out gynaecological examinations, the cadaveric particles were absorbed by the patient, in particular if they {{came into contact with}} the freshly exposed uterus, or with genital tract lesions caused by the birth process. Semmelweis was convinced that every case of childbed fever was caused by resorption of cadaveric particles. With this etiology, Semmelweis identified childbed fever as purely an <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>disease</b> - that is, one caused by doctors.

50|$|In 1862 he was {{appointed}} second assistant to professor Carl Braun in the maternity clinic at Vienna General Hospital. He was encouraged by Braun to study airborne organisms {{as the source of}} childbed fever. As such, Mayrhofer was asked to support the position of Braun in his extremely bitter feud with Ignaz Semmelweis, who claimed that the disease was caused by contaminated hands, in effect blaming doctors for the horrific mortality rates at the time (i.e. that it was an <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>disease).</b> Mayrhofer referred to these organisms as vibrions. At first, Mayrhofer's work supported Braun's views and the results were published. In an 1865 publication, however, Mayrhofer concluded that infection was usually the result of contaminated hands thus rejecting Braun's concept and supporting Ignaz Semmelweis' rivalling theory. Openly disagreeing with his superior, his fate was sealed. Mayrhofer's work was rejected and he soon left the clinic. He entered into private practice. He {{was appointed}} privatdozent of obstetrics in 1870, and a few years later, adjunct professor within the same field.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of misconceptions that people have about the world, {{particularly}} the world as understood by science. There are common working (common sense) assumptions that contradict the conclusions of scientific study, such as the concept of impetus [...] On the other hand, there are misconceptions that emerge (or are installed) through the course of formal instruction - we can be termed didaskalogenic (born through teaching). Both the content associated with a particular subject, and its implications, are influenced by mode of instruction used to present it. Instructional strategies range from the Socratic to the passive lecture format. Given their inherently abstract nature, many scientific concepts, such as Newton's laws of motion directly conflict a [...] "working" [...] and immediate understanding of the world. Where this is the case, such conceptual conflicts can give rise to serious obstacles to students' acceptance and understanding of scientific ideas. In contrast, a wide range of other scientific ideas, assumptions, and concepts are not obviously related to practical experience. Students' misconceptions about these more abstract scientific ideas, for example, the atomic theory, the wave-particle nature of light, the cell theory of biological organization and continuity, and various aspects of modern evolutionary theory are often grounded in, and influenced by past instruction. In analogy to physician-induced (<b>iatrogenic)</b> <b>disease</b> (iatrogenesis), didaskologenic (or didaktikogenic) (from the Greek dáskalos for [...] "teacher") ideas (and misconceptions) arise from and are reinforced during the course of instruction. Particularly in the more abstract sciences, where many ideas are inherently counter-intuitive, didaskologenic scientific misconceptions often arise through the use of inappropriate analogies in the course of instruction.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the incidence, main causes, and risk factors of <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>disease</b> occurring in a department of internal medicine. METHODS: Over a 1 -year period, physicians systematically filled out a 2 -page questionnaire for all patients admitted to the ward. A database was created and the data were statistically analyzed. Patients undergoing immunosuppressive, chemo-, or radiation therapy were excluded. Missing data were completed by reviewing the patients' charts. The patients were then divided into two groups: those with and those without <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>disease.</b> The groups were compared using several parameters including gender, age, social features, days of hospitalization, associated illness, functional status, medical impression, prognosis, associated renal or liver function impairment, drugs taken daily, and outcome. In the group with <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>disease,</b> the type, severity, and predictability were also analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 879 patients admitted to the ward, 445 completed questionnaires and were included in the study. A total of 102 patients (22. 9 %) developed 121 iatrogenic events. Forty-four patients (43. 1 %) were admitted for iatrogenic illness, 10 (9. 8 %) developed life-threatening events, and in 3 (6. 8 %) it was the cause of death. Fifty-eight patients (56. 8 %) registered 77 episodes of <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>disease</b> during their hospital stay, 20 (19. 6 %) developed life-threatening events, and 9 (11. 7 %) died, 4 (5. 2 %) of an iatrogenic cause (nosocomial infections).

40|$|Objective: To {{provide the}} reader with {{an update on the}} {{disposition}} of nitroprusside in the body and the current therapy in managing cyanide and thiocyanate toxicity. Data Sources: Currently available literature reports were used to provide readers with a comprehensive framework that will enable them to monitor for, prevent, and if needed, treat patients with cyanide and/or thiocyanate toxicity. Additional sources were used to provide risk factors, which enable practitioners to identify patients predisposed to such toxicities while receiving nitroprusside.

Effective representation of exposomics knowledge is instrumental to melding nongenetic factors into data analytics for clinical research. There is still limited work in (1) modeling exposome entities and relations with proper integration to mainstream ontologies and (2) systematically studying their presence in clinical context. Through selected ontological relations, we developed a template-driven approach to identifying exposome concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). The derived concepts were evaluated in terms of literature coverage {{and the ability to}} assist in annotating clinical text. The generated semantic model represents rich domain knowledge about exposure events (454 pairs of relations between exposure and outcome).

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{relationship}} of HIV medical technologies to current styles of medical practice and highlights issues posed by the technologies for those working and/or living with HIV. The paper examines HIV anti-retroviral combination therapies and associated tests from the perspective of their prescribers. The prescribers were interviewed during the later part of 2002 at three London HIV clinics. Their comments, considered in light of other recent studies in the field, suggest that current therapies are part of a transitional phase in the epidemic which informs the identification and negotiation of known risks and uncertainty. An undetermined but extended life expectancy, afforded by anti-retroviral therapies, is understood against risk of <b>iatrogenic</b> <b>diseases</b> and/or viral drug resistance. The tension arising in this situation of unwanted and even uncertain phenomena poses ethical dilemmas and affects doctor/patient relations. Indeed, it also contributes to a reconfiguring of the lived experience of managing HIV. While the new technologies have offered considerable advances in the medical management of HIV, they are altering the nature of HIV medicine both materially and socially. The scenario is further complicated by the uneven allocation of resources and different patient health and disease states. The heterogeneity of resources, disease states and technological effects points to the need for ongoing and extended evaluation as the relationship between these and the everyday practice of medicine continues to change...|$|R
