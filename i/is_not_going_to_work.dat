[...] "The Bahraini army has done what the Egyptian army {{did not do}} and exactly what the United States and its other partners urged it not to do -- it has opened fire on its own people," [...] its Washington director said.

2500|$|In 2002, at age 13, vocalist Hayley Williams {{moved from}} her {{hometown}} Meridian, Mississippi to Franklin, Tennessee, {{where she met}} brothers Josh Farro and Zac Farro at a weekly supplemental program for home-schooled students. Shortly after arriving, she began taking vocal lessons with Brett Manning. Prior to forming Paramore, Williams and bassist Jeremy Davis, along with friend Kimee Read, {{took part in a}} funk cover band called The Factory, while Josh and Zac Farro had practiced together after school. The other members of what was soon to be Paramore had been [...] "edgy about the whole female thing" [...] of having Williams as vocalist, but, because they were good friends, she started writing for them. Williams said of the members when she first met them, [...] "They were the first people I met who were as passionate about music as I was." [...] The band was officially formed by Josh Farro (lead guitar/backing vocals), Zac Farro (drums), Davis (bass guitar) and Williams (lead vocals) in 2004, with the later addition of Williams' neighbor Jason Bynum (rhythm guitar). When Davis showed up, he was stunned to find out the drummer was only twelve years old. He admitted [...] "I had very, very, very, little faith in everyone in the band because of their age. I remember thinking, 'This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> because this kid is way too young,' but that first day of practice was amazing. I knew we were on to something." [...] According to Williams, the name [...] "Paramore" [...] came from the maiden name of the mother of one of their first bass players. Once the group learned the meaning of the homophone [...] "" [...] ("secret lover"), they decided to adopt the name, using the Paramore spelling.|$|E
