40|$|The {{influence}} of method of grinding of the cereal {{of the diet}} on production and egg quality was studied in 420 Hy-line brown egg-laying hens. The design was completely randomized with six treatments arranged as a 3 × 2 factorial with three cereals (barley, <b>dented</b> <b>maize</b> and soft wheat) and two grinding procedures (hammer mill vs. roller mill). Each treatment was replicated seven times and the experimental unit was an enriched cage with ten hens. Production was recorded every four weeks from 24 to 59 weeks of age and egg quality was measured at 40 and 56 weeks of age. For the entire experiment, feed intake was higher in hens fed wheat or maize than in hens fed barley (110. 8 and 110. 7 vs. 109. 7 g/d; P = 0. 014) {{but most of the}} differences were observed when the cereal was roller milled (P = 0. 009 for the interaction). Also, egg production was similar for the three diets when the cereal was hammer milled but tended to be lower for the barley than for the wheat or maize diets when the cereal was roller milled (P = 0. 09 for the interaction). None of the other productive or egg quality traits was affected by dietary treatment. We conclude that roller mills are useful to grind low fiber cereals, such as maize or wheat.

40|$|Although maize {{was early}} {{recognized}} as an excellent forage plant soon after its introduction in Europe, during a long time it was only bred for grain traits. However, the first recommendations of maize varieties for specific forage use are probably those given in the French VILMORIN-ANDRIEUX catalogues {{as early as the}} second mid of the 19 th century. The 1940 Dutch variety list distinguished several types of maize varieties and was already recommending three varieties for silage use. Whereas US hybrids were introduced in Europe in the early 1950 s, the significant extension of silage maize cropping began after the release of early flint x dent hybrids such as INRA 258 (1958) and a little later Brillant DK 202, Capella, LG 11, and Blizzard G 188 (between 1965 and 1975). The increase went on until 1990, with a decrease or stabilization following. The first generation of early European maize hybrids was mostly often based on crosses between flint Lacaune and dent Minnesota 13 lines. The registration of Dea (1980) in France and a few years later Golda in Germany both illustrated tremendous changes in <b>maize</b> <b>dent,</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} flint, germplasm and marked the onset of a second era in European maize hybrid breeding. Iodent and BSSS origins were thus substituting for Minnesota 13. Correlatively, the era of 1980 s was also marked by significant improvement of hybrid earliness. The actual maize breeding is characterized by a significantly greater introgression of medium late germplasm into early <b>dent</b> and flint <b>maize</b> lines. The beginning of this last period may be dated by the registration of Banguy (1992). The average genetic improvement in whole plant yield was close to 0. 10 t/ha. year during the period between 1958 and 1988, but reached 0. 17 t/ha. year between 1986 and 2004. In early maize, highly significant improvements of stalk standability, stalk rot and lodging resistance have been achieved between 1950 and 2004 in Europe. Physiological changes associated to these improvements are at least delayed senescence of leaves and stems, higher grain filling rate, and higher stress tolerance. Conversely to agronomic value, a steady decline in the average cell wall digestibility of hybrids was observed since the 1950 s, and maize of the next future have to give a better balance between agronomic and feeding value traits.

Until World War II, the main source of starch in the USA was tapioca but when Japan severed the supply lines of the States, they forced processors to turn to waxy maize.

It has a large ear with grains that are more white, round, and tender than the typical field corn grain. The dried grains are soaked and/or cooked in water with lime or wood ash, then rinsed thoroughly to remove the outer seed coat as well as any traces of the alkali salts (from the lime or ash)—this is an ancient process called nixtamalization. This creates a fresh, wet hominy, which can be dried for later use or ground into a flour called masa to make tortillas, tamales, atole, pozole, etc... (the dry hominy can also be ground to make dry masa). When boiling the grains, they open by themselves like a flower, and a loose foam appears. The primary use of cacahuazintle grain is in the embodiment of the traditional Mexican dish pozole. The Náhuatl name pozole, pozolli, means sparkling, probably from the foam produced when cooking this type of corn.|$|E

One of the major challenges in genome-enabled prediction is how to construct a training set of genotypes from a calibration set that represents the target population of genotypes, where the calibration set is composed of a training and validation set. A random sampling protocol of genotypes from the calibration set will lead to low quality coverage of the total genetic space by the training set when the calibration set contains population structure. As a consequence, predictive ability will be affected negatively, because some parts of the genotypic diversity in the target population will be under-represented in the training set, whereas other parts will be over-represented.

Grain yield, ears m- 2, kernels ear- 1, kernels row- 1, rows ear- 1, ear length and circumference, and kernel weight were measured. Environment and water regime altered maize yield components depending upon the timing and degree of stress present. Early-season stress reduced the number of ears m- 2, late-season stress reduced kernel weight, and mid-season stress reduced the number of kernels m- 2. The Mead 2013 environment produced the highest grain yield of 11. 7 Mg ha- 1, while the lowest average yield was 7. 0 Mg ha- 1 in the North Platte 2012 environment. Irrigation increased grain yield by 3. 1 to 3. 3 Mg ha- 1 at Mead and 8. 1 - 12. 7 Mg ha- 1 at North Platte. Hybrid altered yield and yield components, with the most differences in this study related to maturity classifications. Plant population had no effect on grain yield across populations which was 10. 7 Mg ha- 1. Ears m- 2 increased from 6. 6 to 9. 4 with increasing plant population while the number of rows ear- 1 decreased from 16. 2 to 15. 0, and kernels ear- 1 from 546 to 410. Kernels ear- 1 was the yield component most highly correlated with yield (R = 0. 47 to 0. 78) in the plant population study and North Platte dryland environment for the waxy study, while kernel weight was the most highly correlated (R = 0. 67) in the Mead and North Platte irrigated environments in the waxy study. Waxy maize was found to have a similar yield potential and interactions among yield components to <b>dent</b> <b>maize.</b> Results indicated that environment, plant population, hybrid and water regime affect maize grain yield and its components and that stress timing correlates with developing yield components.

40|$|Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium verticillioides are fungal plant {{pathogens}} {{that can}} cause yield losses, reductions in grain quality, and produce mycotoxins {{that can cause}} serious diseases in animals and humans when contaminated grain is consumed. Both pathogens can infect and cause disease in seedlings. F. graminearum infects cereals and other crops and produces mycotoxins including deoxynivalenol (DON), which {{can act as a}} virulence factor for Gibberella ear rot in maize and head blight of wheat. F. verticillioides infects maize and produces fumonisins, a group of mycotoxins with phytotoxic properties. Previous research into the role of these mycotoxins in seedling diseases has been conflicting. To assess the roles of deoxynivalenol and fumonisins in seedling disease, wild-type and mycotoxin non-producing mutants of both fungi were used to inoculate seeds in rolled-towel experiments. F. verticillioides isolates were used to infect dent and sweet varieties of maize while F. graminearum isolates were used to infect <b>dent</b> <b>maize,</b> soybeans and wheat. Plant weights, shoot lengths and disease severity (soybean only) were measured at 7 days. Additionally, infection levels were compared by quantifying fungal biomass present in plant tissue between fungal isolates using qPCR. Finally, an experiment to determine changes in gene expression in maize inbred B 73 when infected with wild-type or deoxynivalenol non-producing isolates of F. graminearum was performed to better understand the infection process and response of the plant to DON. Results of experiments with F. graminearum differed among the varieties for all crop species. In soybean, only the susceptible cultivar demonstrated significant differences between plants inoculated with the wild-type and the DON non-producing mutant for plant weight and length. In wheat, the wild type, but not the mutant, caused reductions in weight and length in the susceptible cultivar. The partially resistant variety was reduced in plant weight by both isolates, but neither isolate reduced shoot or root length. In maize, the wild type and the mutant had an impact on shoot length and plant weight for all three hybrids tested. In one susceptible hybrid the wild-type caused greater effects than the DON non-producing mutant. Results indicate that DON production is not required for pathogenicity in seedlings, but the wild-type isolate generally produced greater symptoms and there are interactions between host genotype and DON effects. Gene expression changes in maize in response to infection with wild-type and a DON- mutant revealed that different genes were expressed during early infection and plant germination in comparison to genes expressed after 7 days. There were minimal differences between the wild-type and the mutant isolates for any of the time points sampled. There were greater differences between wild-type infected plants and mock-inoculated plants. Experiments with Fusarium verticillioides in sweet and <b>dent</b> <b>maize</b> did not provide conclusive results about the effects of fumonisins on seedling disease. For hybrid <b>dent</b> <b>maize,</b> shoot length and plant weight were reduced by only two out of ten isolates tested, regardless of fumonisin production. Fungal biomass was higher in the root tissues than mesocotyl tissues but did not show consistent differences between fumonisin producing and non-producing isolates. In sweet maize {{there were no significant differences}} in plant weight or shoot length between plants inoculated with fumonisin-producing and non-producing isolates. All isolates were significantly different from the control for both plant weight and shoot length. Fungal biomass quantification for F. verticillioides in sweet maize was highly variable but fumonisin-producing strains did not consistently colonize the plant tissue to a greater extent than non-producing strains...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of 1 -allyloxy- 2 -hydroxy-propyl starches was studied using a statistical experimental design approach. The etherification {{of two different}} granular maize starches with allyl glycidyl ether (AGE) in a heterogeneous alkaline suspension was investigated. The optimal reaction conditions were found via experimental design and the obtained response factor, e. g. the degree of substitution (DS) of the starch hydroxyl group, was statistically evaluated. The effects of six process factors on DS, namely the starch concentration, the reaction time, the temperature, {{and the amount of}} NaOH, Na 2 SO 4 and AGE were investigated. The statistical analysis showed significant impact of the temperature, the amount of NaOH and the amount of AGE on the DS for both starches. Optimum conditions for the highest DS for waxy maize starch were: 0. 0166 % AGE (based on dry starch (ds)) and 1. 0 % NaOH (ds) at 34 °C in 4 h; on <b>dent</b> <b>maize</b> starch, these were 0. 0099 % AGE (ds) and 1. 0 % NaOH (ds) at 37 °C in 16 h...|$|E
