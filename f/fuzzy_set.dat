Furthering research and treatment of diabetes, the HbA1c was discovered by Samuel Rahbar. Iranian physics is especially strong in string theory, with many papers being published in Iran. Iranian American string theorist Kamran Vafa proposed the Vafa–Witten theorem together with Edward Witten.

30|$|In this section, firstly, some {{preliminaries}} of Pythagorean <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> {{and corresponding}} notations are described.

50|$|Work on type-2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> languished {{during the}} 1980s and early-to-mid 1990's, {{although}} {{a small number}} of articles were published about them.

50|$|Type-2 fuzzy {{sets and}} systems generalize Type-1 fuzzy sets and systems {{so that more}} {{uncertainty}} can be handled. From {{the very beginning of}} fuzzy sets, criticism was made {{about the fact that the}} membership function of a type-1 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> has no uncertainty associated with it, something that seems to contradict the word fuzzy, since that word has the connotation of lots of uncertainty. So, what does one do when there is uncertainty about the value of the membership function? The answer to this question was provided in 1975 by the inventor of fuzzy sets, Prof. Lotfi A. Zadeh 27, when he proposed more sophisticated kinds of fuzzy sets, the first of which he called a type-2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set.</b> A type-2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> lets us incorporate uncertainty about the membership function into <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> theory, and is a way to address the above criticism of type-1 fuzzy sets head-on.
