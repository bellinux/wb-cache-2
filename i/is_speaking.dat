5|$|Some have {{interpreted}} Bahá'u'lláh's writing style {{to conclude that}} Bahá'u'lláh had claimed divinity. Bahá'u'lláh, however, states himself that the essence of God will never descend into the human world. Statements where Bahá'u'lláh speaks with the voice of God are meant {{that he is not}} actually God, but that he <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> with the attributes of God.|$|E
5|$|Hazel: The {{daughter}} of the two lead characters, born in the first issue, who occasionally narrates the series. She has wings like her mother, horns like her father, and green-brown eyes unlike those of either of her parents. She spends most of her childhood {{growing up in the}} organic tree-like rocketship with which she and her parents escape Cleave. She is seen taking her first steps {{at the end of the}} third story arc, and <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> in simple phrases by the beginning of the fourth.

5|$|Larry's {{interactions}} with key women {{are accompanied by}} a detailed image of whomever he <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> with, unlike other non-player characters. With {{the exception of the}} prostitute, each of the women shun Larry at first, but respond favorably to gifts of varying sorts. Although {{it is not possible to}} woo all of the women, giving gifts is needed to advance to the game's final area, the hotel penthouse. To this end, money is essential to advance through the game. The only available method of augmenting Larry's funds is to gamble in the casino, playing blackjack and slots.|$|E

5|$|Many sources {{state the}} meaning of Rhondda as 'noisy', though this is a {{simplified}} translation without research. Sir Ifor Williams, in his work Enwau Lleoedd, suggests that the first syllable rhwadd {{is a form of}} the Welsh adrawdd or adrodd, as in 'recite, relate, recount', similar to the Old Irish rád; 'speech'. The suggestion is that the river <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> aloud, a comparison to the English expression 'a babbling brook'.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at {{the office}}, {{half of the}} office opts to stay behind. Robert California (James Spader) makes a {{spontaneous}} visit and asks them {{to come up with}} Dunder Mifflin/Sabre's next big idea. However, the office fails to impress Robert with their ideas. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) details an idea he has about cookie placement in the vending machine, but Robert gets the impression that he is extremely clever and <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> only in metaphors. Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who has been annoyed the entire day with Kevin being creative and Robert rejecting his ideas, later tricks Kevin into explaining an idea he has involving the Big Mac, and Robert realizes that there was no subtext to Kevin's ideas.|$|E

When Drake's verse is over, Rihanna pushes him and walks away with a smile.|$|E

5|$|Dishonoreds stealth {{system was}} {{originally}} {{based on that}} of the Thief series, which uses level lighting and shadows to determine whether an enemy can detect the player character's presence. However, {{it was decided that}} it was unrealistic that an enemy could stand directly in front of a player hiding in shadows and not detect them. It was also considered that making certain areas dark hid the designers' work and contrasted poorly with well-lit areas. Much of the ambient dialogue was written to be lengthy and add background detail to the game world and to entertain stealth players who may be in a single area for a long time. Conversely, main story dialogue was written to be short to compensate for the player being able to interrupt or kill the character who <b>is</b> <b>speaking.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scully theorizes that Gates {{has brought}} Kevin to a {{recycling}} plant he owns in Jerusalem, Ohio. Mulder {{thinks that he}} has headed to the airport, as a man matching Gates' description was reported headed there. Mulder thinks Scully believes that she's been chosen to protect Kevin. Scully arrives at the recycling plant where Gates tells Kevin that he must die for the 'New Age' to come. Gates attempts to jump into a paper shredding machine with Kevin, but Kevin grabs onto the side as Gates falls into the shredder. Scully is able to pull Kevin to safety. Two days later, Scully and Kevin say goodbye. Kevin tells Scully he'll see her again. Scully goes to the confessional {{for the first time}} in years, wondering if God <b>is</b> <b>speaking,</b> but that no one is listening.|$|E

25|$|The game also {{includes}} an alternate final level, where the final battle is played from Leo's perspective.

As he looks at himself in the mirror, Daniel sees Leo's reflection looking back at him.|$|E
25|$|Anyone {{who claims}} to speak God's words or teach in his name {{and is not a}} prophet the Bible terms a false prophet. One test given in the Old Testament in Deuteronomy {{contains}} a warning of those who prophecy events which do not come to pass and said they should be put to death. Elsewhere a false prophet may be someone who is purposely trying to deceive, is delusional, under the influence of Satan or <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> from his own spirit.|$|E

25|$|Every Yemenite Jew {{knew how}} to read from the Torah Scroll with the correct {{pronunciation}} and tune, exactly right in every detail. Each man who was called up to the Torah read his section by himself. All this was possible because children {{right from the start}} learned to read without any vowels. Their diction is much more correct than the Sephardic and Ashkenazic dialect. The results of their education are outstanding, for example if someone <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> with his neighbor and needs to quote a verse from the Bible, he speaks it out by heart, without pause or effort, with its melody.|$|E
25|$|Salvation is {{available}} through Jesus' work on the cross and is a gift from God made possible by grace through faith and not by human works. The PCG believes {{it is possible to}} lose one's salvation if one turns away from God. After salvation, a Christian can receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The evidence of this baptism <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> in other tongues. It believes in the doctrine of sanctification as a definite and progressive work of grace. It believes heaven and hell are real places. Heaven is for those who have received the gift of salvation, and hell is for those who have not.|$|E
25|$|Another {{aspect of}} microsociology aims {{to focus on}} {{individual}} behavior in social settings. One specific researcher in the field, Erving Goffman, claims that humans {{tend to believe that}} they are actors on a stage. He explains his theories in his book The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. He argues that as a result, individuals will further proceed with their actions based on the response of that individual's 'audience' or in other words, the people to whom he <b>is</b> <b>speaking.</b> Much like a play, Goffman believes that rules of conversing and communication exist: to display confidence, display sincerity, and avoid infractions which are otherwise known as embarrassing situations. Breaches of such rules are what make social situations awkward.|$|E
