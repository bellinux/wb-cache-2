500|$|Favreau {{wanted the}} film to be {{believable}} by showing {{the construction of the}} Iron Man suit in its three stages. Stan Winston, a fan of the comic book, and his company, who Favreau worked with on Zathura, built metal and rubber versions of the armors. The Mark I design was intended to look like it was built from spare parts. The back is less armored than the front, because Stark would use his resources for a forward attack. It also foreshadows the design of Stane's armor. A single [...] version was built, causing concern when a stuntman fell over inside it, though both the stuntman and the suit were unscathed. The armor was also designed to only have its top <b>half</b> <b>worn</b> at times. Stan Winston Studios built a , [...] animatronic version of [...] "Iron Monger" [...] (Obadiah Stane), a name which Obadiah Stane calls Tony Stark and himself earlier in the film as a reference, but is never actually used for the suit itself in the film. The animatronic required five operators for the arm, and was built on a gimbal to simulate walking. A scale model was used for the shots of it being built. The Mark II resembles an airplane prototype, with visible flaps. Iron Man comic book artist Adi Granov designed the Mark III with illustrator Phil Saunders. Granov's designs were the primary inspiration for the film's, and he came on board the film after he recognized his work on Jon Favreau's MySpace page. Saunders streamlined Granov's concept art, making it stealthier and less cartoonish in its proportions, and also designed the War Machine armor, but it was [...] "cut from the script about halfway through pre-production." [...] He explained that the War Machine armor [...] "was going to be called the Mark IV armor and would have had weaponized swap-out parts that would be worn over the original Mark III armor," [...] and that it [...] "would have been worn by Tony Stark in the final battle sequence." ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{specific risk}} factors for concussion severity among ice hockey players wearing full face shields compared with half face shields (visors). Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted during one varsity hockey season (1997 – 1998) with 642 male ice hockey players (median age 22 years) from 22 teams participating in the Canadian Inter-University Athletics Union. Half of the teams wore full face shields, and <b>half</b> <b>wore</b> <b>half</b> shields (visors) for every practice and game throughout the season. Team therapists and doctors recorded on structured forms daily injury, participation, and information on face shield use for each athlete. The main outcome measure was any traumatic brain injury requiring assessment or treatment by a team therapist or doctor, categorised by time lost from subsequent participation and compared by type of face shield worn. Results: Players who <b>wore</b> <b>half</b> face shields missed significantly more practices and games per concus-sion (2. 4 times) than players who wore full face shields (4. 07 sessions (95 % confidence interval (CI) 3. 48 to 4. 74) v 1. 71 sessions (95 % CI 1. 32 to 2. 18) respectively). Significantly more playing time was lost by players <b>wearing</b> <b>half</b> shields during practices and games, and did not depend on whether the athletes were forwards or defence, rookies or veterans, or whether the concussions were new or recur...|$|R
6000|$|I have printed {{the letters}} {{as they are}} placed in the inscription, in order that the reader may form {{some idea of the}} {{difficulty}} of reading such legends when the letters, thus thrown into one heap, are themselves of strange forms, and <b>half</b> <b>worn</b> away; any gaps which at all occur between them coming in the wrong places. There is no doubt, however, as to the reading of this fragment:--"T ... Sancte Marie Domini Genetricis et beati Estefani martiri ego indignus et peccator Domenicus T." [...] On these two initial and final T's, expanding one into Templum, the other into Torcellanus, M. Lazari founds an ingenious conjecture that the inscription records the elevation of the church under a certain bishop Dominic of Torcello (named in the Altinat Chronicle), who flourished {{in the middle of the}} ninth century. If this were so, as the inscription occurs broken off on a fragment inserted scornfully in the present edifice, this edifice must be of the twelfth century, worked with fragments taken from the ruins of that built in the ninth. The two T's are, however, hardly a foundation large enough to build the church upon, a hundred years before the date assigned to it both by history and tradition (see above, § VIII.): and the reader has yet to be made aware of the principal fact bearing on the question.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a drawing}} of an infant's shoe, <b>half</b> <b>worn</b> out, with the airy print of the blessed foot within; a thing {{that would make a}} mother smile or weep out of the very depths of her heart; and yet an actual mother would not have been likely to {{appreciate}} the poetry of the little shoe, until Miriam revealed it to her. It was wonderful, the depth and force with which the above, and other kindred subjects, were depicted, and the profound significance which they often acquired. The artist, still in her fresh youth, could not probably have drawn any of these dear and rich experiences from her own life; unless, perchance, that first sketch of all, the avowal of maiden affection, were a remembered incident, and not a prophecy. But it is more delightful to believe that, from first to last, they were the productions of a beautiful imagination, dealing with the warm and pure suggestions of a woman's heart, and thus idealizing a truer and lovelier picture of the life that belongs to woman, than an actual acquaintance with some of its hard and dusty facts could have inspired. So considered, the sketches intimated such a force and variety of imaginative sympathies as would enable Miriam to fill her life richly with the bliss and suffering of womanhood, however barren it might individually be.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was a very}} {{beautiful}} day, and though {{the shadow of the}} cathedral fell on this side, yet, it being about noontide, it did not cover the churchyard entirely, but left many of the graves in sunshine. There were not a great many monuments, and these were chiefly horizontal slabs, some of which looked aged, but on closer inspection proved to be mostly of the present century. I observed an old stone figure, however, <b>half</b> <b>worn</b> away, which seemed to have something like a bishop's mitre on its head, and may perhaps have lain in the proudest chapel of the cathedral before occupying its present bed among the grass. About fifteen paces from the central tower, and within its shadow, I found a weather-worn slab of marble, seven or eight feet long, the inscription on which interested me somewhat. It was to the memory of Robert Dodsley, the bookseller, Johnson's acquaintance, who, as his tombstone rather superciliously avers, had made a much better figure as an author than [...] "could have been expected in his rank of life." [...] But, after all, it is inevitable that a man's tombstone should look down on him, or, at all events, comport itself towards him [...] "de haut en bas." [...] I love to find the graves of men connected with literature. They interest me more, even though of no great eminence, than those of persons far more illustrious in other walks of life.

Two 3 –piece bogies were tested; both had constant force type friction wedge dampers. One bogie had constant force wedges housed in the bolster. The other bogie had constant force wedges housed in the sideframes. The bogies tested were not reconditioned with wedges <b>half</b> <b>worn</b> or more. Tests were completed using a coal wagon ballasted with scrap steel to simulate a loaded wagon. Track profile inputs were simulated using position controlled hydraulic cylinders. Both bogies were subjected to bounce tests at 3 and 7 Hz and sinusoidal rail profile inputs of wavelengths 3. 0 m with simulated vehicle speeds of 40 and 80 kph. Further variation in suspension behaviour was investigated by simulating variations in wheelset wheel diameters. Wheelset diameter mismatches of 24 mm were simulated for first and second axles on the bogie. Rail profile magnitudes tested were 24 mm peak to peak. The bounce tests illustrated the inadequacy of the friction damping at resonance. The simulation of rail profile inputs, which resulted in pitch motion of the bogie sideframes resulted in unexpected hysteresis performance. The work demonstrates {{the limitations of the}} friction dampers commonly used on freight bogies and highlights the need for more detailed mathematical models in wagon simulation...|$|E

40|$|The use of snow tyres in New Zealand is {{becoming}} more common due to lower priced late model second hand passenger cars being imported fitted with older <b>half</b> <b>worn</b> snow tyres. Inappropriate use of snow tyres has been anecdotally linked {{to a number of}} serious and fatal crashes nationally. A primary consideration for crash investigators is to establish whether or not the use of the snow tyres contributed to the cause of those crashes. This paper describes comparative testing of snow tyres and conventional tyres for both wet and dry road surfaces. Testing was undertaken for both cornering and straight line emergency braking. The tests were performed by NZ Police Serious Crash Unit staff. Preliminary test results indicated a significant reduction in traction for snow tyres when compared to conventional car tyres during cornering manoeuvres, and a considerable increase in stopping distances on wet surfaces under emergency braking situations. An analysis of the results from initial testing showed a reduction in cornering (lateral) traction of around 6. 0 % on a dry road and 9. 2 % in the wet. Regarding stopping distances under emergency braking, in the dry there was a reduction in stopping distance of around 13. 1 %, but an increase in stopping distance in the wet of 16. 0 %. This equates to an increase in stopping distance on a wet road surface of about 2. 6 metres at 50 km/h and about 10. 6 metres at a speed of 100 km/h. The research, although limited in extent, show that snow tyres do not offer as much grip as can be achieved with conventional tyres, particularly in wet conditions and also during cornering in wet or dry road conditions. Further testing is required to determine if the age of the snow tyres and/or the road surface type will {{have an effect on the}} results (asphalt, bitumen chip etc). This testing should clarify the relationship between tyre type, tread depth and friction...|$|E
