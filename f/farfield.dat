25|$|The main {{environmental}} concern with tidal energy {{is associated with}} blade strike and entanglement of marine organisms as high speed water {{increases the risk of}} organisms being pushed near or through these devices. As with all offshore renewable energies, there is also a concern about how the creation of EMF and acoustic outputs may affect marine organisms. It should be noted that because these devices are in the water, the acoustic output can be greater than those created with offshore wind energy. Depending on the frequency and amplitude of sound generated by the tidal energy devices, this acoustic output can have varying effects on marine mammals (particularly those who echolocate to communicate and navigate in the marine environment, such as dolphins and whales). Tidal energy removal can also cause {{environmental concern}}s such as degrading <b>farfield</b> water quality and disrupting sediment processes. Depending {{on the size of the}} project, these effects can range from small traces of sediment building up near the tidal device to severely affecting nearshore ecosystems and processes.|$|E
40|$|We {{deal with}} the problem of reconstructing {{material}} coefficients from the <b>farfields</b> they generate. By embedding small (single) inclusions to these media, located at points $z$ in the support of these materials, and measuring the <b>farfields</b> generated by these deformations we can extract the values of the total field generated by these media at the points $z$. The second step is to extract the values of the material coefficients from these internal values of the total field. The main difficulty in using internal fields is the treatment of their possible zeros. In this work, we propose to deform the medium using multiple (precisely double) and close inclusions instead of only single ones. By doing so, we derive from the asymptotic expansions of the <b>farfields</b> the internal values of the Green function, in addition to the internal values of the total fields. This is possible because of the deformation of the medium with multiple and close inclusions which generates scattered fields due to the multiple scattering between these inclusions. Then, the values of the index of refraction can be extracted from the singularities of the Green function. Hence, we overcome the difficulties arising from the zeros of the internal fields. We test these arguments for the acoustic scattering by a refractive index in presence of inclusions modeled by the impedance type small obstacles.

40|$|In this work, we are {{concerned}} with the inverse scattering by interfaces for the linearized and isotropic elastic model at a fixed frequency. First, we derive complex geometrical optic solutions with linear or spherical phases having a computable dominant part and an H^α-decaying remainder term with α < 3, where H^α is the classical Sobolev space. Second, based on these properties, we estimate the convex hull as well as non convex parts of the interface using the <b>farfields</b> of only one of the two reflected body waves (pressure waves or shear waves) as measurements. The results are given for both the impenetrable obstacles, with traction boundary conditions, and the penetrable obstacles.

Somatosensory evoked potentials(SEPs) to electrical stimulation of the median nerve on {{the left or right}} side were averaged and mapped out over the scalp. Stimulation on the side opposite to the missing hemisphere evoked brief P 9 and P 14 <b>farfields</b> and a slow N 18 negative potential of 15 ‐to 25 ‐msec duration bilaterally. No additional focal response was detected over the remaining (ipsilateral) hemisphere for 60 msec after the stimulus. Because long‐standing hemispherectomy entails massive retrograde degeneration of thalamocortical neurons, the preserved P 14 and N 18 responses must reflect neural activities generated below the thalamus that are volume conducted to the scalp bilaterally.

These scatterers are assumed to be included in a bounded domain Ω in R^ 3 which is embedded in an acoustic background characterized by an eventually locally varying index of refraction. The collection of the scatterers D_m, m= 1, [...] .,M is modeled by four parameters: their number M, their maximum radius a, their minimum distance d and the surface impedances λ_m, m= 1, [...] .,M. We consider the parameters M, d and λ_m's having the following scaling properties: M:=M(a) =O(a^-s), d:=d(a) ≈ a^t and λ_m:=λ_m(a) =λ_m, 0 a^-β, as a → 0, with non negative constants s, t and β and complex numbers λ_m, 0 's with eventually negative imaginary parts.

40|$|High-power, {{coherent}} radiation from semiconductor lasers is attractive for such diverse applications as free-space communication, optical data storage, and microsurgery. However, several factors conspire to prevent near-ideal performance from broad area devices and laser arrays. Waveguides wider {{than a few}} microns support many lateral modes with poor gain discrimination. Consequently, such modes are easily "mixed" by perturbations in gain and refractive index caused by gain saturation, thermal gradients, and inhomogeneities that are due to imperfect crystal growth. This causes spatially localized modes, multimode operation, and reduced spatial coherence, all of which lead to <b>farfields</b> broader than the "diffraction limit. " In this thesis, we have investigated the influence of gain saturation on the lateral modes of broad area structures and laser arrays. Analytical and numerical techniques {{have been developed to}} solve self-consistently for mode shapes and propagation constants as a function of injected current density above threshold. For example, our analysis indicates that the gain-saturated modes of broad area lasers consist of an integer number of phase-locked "filaments. " In gain-guided quantum well lasers, these nonlinear modes are observed to oscillate into narrow, single-lobed <b>farfields,</b> which broaden only slightly with increased power output up to the 500 mW level. Conversely, laser arrays have been widely touted as structures that suppress unwanted filamentation in favor of spatial mode control. Indeed, in this work we have demonstrated supermode control at the 100 mW power level by varying the diffraction region length in diffraction-coupled arrays. Both theoretically and experimentally, however, we have found the lateral modes of laser arrays to be unstable with increased current injection. Waveguides that are phase-matched below threshold become detuned under the influence of gain saturation, so that interguide power transfer is reduced. This decreases the injection-locking bandwidth, and ultimately, the spatial coherence. While undesirable for a laser oscillator, this property may be attractive for all-optical switching in nonlinear directional couplers. Finally, we have considered marrying the high-power, coherent output of broad area lasers and laser arrays with the broadband tunability possible in semiconductor lasers. In particular, the steplike density of states unique to quantum well structures results in gain spectra that are broader and flatter than comparable spectra of double heterostructure lasers. Experimentally, we have tuned uncoated, single quantum well stripe lasers in a grating-coupled external cavity over a range > 125 nm centered about 800 nm. Similarly tuned broad area lasers output in excess of 200 mW (pulsed) into a single longitudinal mode over 80 nm, and buried heterostructure lasers were operated continuously over 90 nm. We expect that in the future, such devices could provide a compact, rugged, more efficient alternative to dye lasers...|$|R
40|$|Let M be {{the number}} of bounded and Lipschitz regular {{obstacles}} D_j, j:= 1, [...] ., M having a maximum radius a, a<< 1, located in a bounded domain Ω of R^ 3. We {{are concerned with the}} acoustic scattering problem with {{a very large number of}} obstacles, as M:=M(a) :=O(a^- 1), a→ 0, when they are arbitrarily distributed in Ω with a minimum distance between them of the order d:=d(a) :=O(a^t) with t in an appropriate range. We show that the acoustic <b>farfields</b> corresponding to the scattered waves by this collection of obstacles, taken to be soft obstacles, converge uniformly in terms of the incident as well the propagation directions, to the one corresponding to an acoustic refraction index as a→ 0. This refraction index is given as a product of two coefficients C and K, where the first one is related to the geometry of the obstacles (precisely their capacitance) and the second one is related to the local distribution of these obstacles. In addition, we provide explicit error estimates, in terms of a, in the case when the obstacles are locally the same (i. e. have the same capacitance, or the coefficient C is piecewise constant) in Ω and the coefficient K is Hölder continuous. These approximations can be applied, in particular, to the theory of acoustic materials for the design of refraction indices by perforation using either the geometry of the holes, i. e. the coefficient C, or their local distribution in a given domain Ω, i. e. the coefficient K.

40|$|Semiconductor lasers {{with high}} beam quality and high optical output power are very {{attractive}} {{for a variety}} of applications such as molecular spectroscopy, fiber optic communication systems and nonlinear frequency conversion for laser TV. When easy and low-cost fabrication is a further requirement, devices based on tapered gain sections are the most promising candidates. Low modal gain, single quantum well InGaAs/AlGaAs devices emitting between 940 nm and 1040 nm were grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The lateral design consists of a tapered and a ridge-waveguide section having an overall length of 2. 5 mm. Whereas the length of the tapered structure determines the high output power, the high brightness requires a ridge-waveguide structure with sufficient length. Here the length of the tapered section has been chosen to 2 mm leading to an emitting facet width of 200 µm. Besides an electro-optical characterisation, the near fields and the beam quality parameters M 2 have been carefully investigated. The tendency of near field profiles towards filamentation at higher output powers can be described {{with the help of the}} linewidth enhancement factor alpha(exp H). Assuming a strong dependence of alpha(exp H) on the current density, this behaviour can be simulated in good accordance with the experiment. The corrected <b>farfields</b> and the linewidth enhancement factor have been measured to detect the influence of the carrier density on the beam quality. By increasing the length of the ridge section or the taper section, it is possible to reduce alpha(exp H). A smaller alpha(exp H) leads to a lower tendency of filamentation and hence to a better beam quality. By combining these two mechanisms, we achieved an optical output power of up to 4 W in continuous wave mode (cw) and 11. 6 W in quasi-cw mode. The wall plug efficiency reaches 42 % at a current of 4 A. The beam quality parameter M 2 remains nearly diffraction limited up to about 3. 5 W with values below 1. 3 resulting in an improved brightness of more than 260 MW/(cm 2 sr). In conclusion, the combination of a tapered structure and a ridge-waveguide structure is a promising design for applications, which depend on both high power and high brightness...|$|R
