5|$|For {{her role}} in the film Sophie's Choice (1982), Streep spoke both English and German with a Polish accent, as well as Polish itself. In The Iron Lady, she {{reproduced}} the vocal style of Margaret Thatcher from the time before Thatcher became Britain's Prime Minister, and after she had taken elocution lessons to change her pitch, pronunciation, and delivery. Streep has commented that using accents as part of her acting <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>technique</b> she views as an obvious requirement in her portrayal of a character.|$|E
5|$|Research on a cleaner, less {{energy-intensive}} lead {{extraction process}} continues; a major drawback is that either too much lead is lost as waste, or the alternatives {{result in a}} high sulfur content in the resulting lead metal. Hydrometallurgical extraction, in which anodes of impure lead are immersed into an electrolyte and pure lead is deposited onto a cathode, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>technique</b> that may have potential.|$|E
5|$|Soaring {{related to}} wind shear, also called dynamic soaring, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>technique</b> used by soaring birds like albatrosses, who can {{maintain}} flight without wing flapping. If the wind shear is of sufficient magnitude, a bird can {{climb into the}} wind gradient, trading ground speed for height, while maintaining airspeed. By then turning downwind, and diving through the wind gradient, they can also gain energy. It has also been used by glider pilots on rare occasions.|$|E

5|$|The inner Solar System {{has been}} made the goal of at least four {{unmanned}} programs. The first was Mariner in the 1960s and '70s, which made multiple visits to Venus and Mars and one to Mercury. Probes launched under the Mariner program were also the first to make a planetary flyby (Mariner 2), {{to take the first}} pictures from another planet (Mariner 4), the first planetary orbiter (Mariner 9), and the first to make a gravity assist maneuver (Mariner 10). This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>technique</b> where the satellite takes advantage of the gravity and velocity of planets to reach its destination.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>technique</b> {{used for}} determining the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, in which the crystalline atoms cause a beam of incident X-rays to diffract into many specific directions. By measuring the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams, a crystallographer can produce a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal. From this electron density, the mean positions of the atoms in the crystal can be determined, {{as well as their}} chemical bonds, their disorder, and various other information.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the time step chosen within the model {{is related to the}} {{distance}} between the points on the computational grid, and is chosen to maintain numerical stability. Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes, while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes. The global models are run at varying times into the future. The Met Office's Unified Model is run six days into the future, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model is run out to 10days into the future, while the Global Forecast System model run by the Environmental Modeling Center is run 16days into the future. The visual output produced by a model solution is known as a prognostic chart, or prog. The raw output is often modified before being presented as the forecast. This can be in the form of statistical techniques to remove known biases in the model, or of adjustment to take into account consensus among other numerical weather forecasts. MOS or model output statistics <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>technique</b> used to interpret numerical model output and produce site-specific guidance. This guidance is presented in coded numerical form, and can be obtained for nearly all National Weather Service reporting stations in the United States. As proposed by Edward Lorenz in 1963, long range forecasts, those made at a range of two weeks or more, are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere, owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved. In numerical models, extremely small errors in initial values double roughly every five days for variables such as temperature and wind velocity.|$|E

40|$|Video stimulated recall {{interviewing}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> research <b>technique</b> {{in which}} subjects view a video sequence of their behaviour and are then invited {{to reflect on}} their decision-making processes during the videoed event. Despite its popularity, this technique raises methodological issues for researchers, particularly novice researchers in education. The paper reports that while stimulated recall <b>is</b> <b>a</b> valuable <b>technique</b> for investigating decision making processes in relation to specific events, it <b>is</b> not <b>a</b> <b>technique</b> that lends itself as <b>a</b> universal <b>technique</b> for research. This paper recounts one study in educational research where stimulated recall interview was used successfully as a useful tool for collecting data with an adapted version of SRI procedure...|$|R
