40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} future of <b>the</b> <b>Uniting</b> Church through <b>the</b> use of scenario planning. This {{is the first time}} that this management technique has been used on an Australian church. 	Chapter 1 explains why the dissertation was written and how it was done. 	Chapter 2 provides an overview of <b>the</b> <b>Uniting</b> Church in Australia. 	Chapter 3 explains the management technique of scenario planning and the creation of scenarios (“futures”). 	Part II consists five chapters. Chapter 4 is an introduction to the four scenarios (or “futures”). 	Chapter 5 deals with the first scenario: “Word and Deed” and examines <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>Uniting</b> Church could become a church of a small number of large parishes providing both spiritual activities and social welfare. 	Chapter 6 deals with the second scenario: “Secular Welfare” and examines <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>Uniting</b> Church could let the parishes fade away and instead focus on the provision of social welfare (albeit derived from a Christian tradition). 	Chapter 7 deals with the third scenario: “Return to the Early Church”, which examines <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>Uniting</b> Church could reinvent itself as per the first three centuries of the Christian church. 	Chapter 8 deals with the fourth scenario: “Recessional” in which <b>the</b> <b>Uniting</b> Church is wound up and its assets dispersed. 	Part III, containing chapter 9, asks the question “Where to from here?” This chapter argues that <b>the</b> <b>Uniting</b> Church has fundamental organizational problems. It then examines some basic ideas to assist <b>the</b> <b>Uniting</b> Church to think about its future. The Appendix contains information on how I work with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in assessing their future. There is also a detailed Bibliography...|$|R

25|$|After the American Revolution, the United States {{immediately}} began juggling {{its foreign policy}} between many different views under the George Washington cabinet. Most notably, the rivalry between Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton arose due to their opposing views on <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States should align itself with Revolutionary France in its war against Great Britain in 1793. Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans, who viewed the French revolution as similar to the previous American revolution, believed the United States should declare war on Great Britain as an ally of France, citing the 1778 Franco-American alliance which was still technically in effect. However, Hamilton and the Federalists desired favorable terms with the Bank of England {{in the hopes of}} establishing enough credit with the Crown to establish an American national banking system. Hamilton's camp would take the day and influenced Washington to remain neutral during the conflict, destroying relations with France.|$|E
25|$|The Nochiya Tribes {{territory}} {{is unique in}} that it goes through three different countries: Turkey, Iran, and Iraq. The {{reason for this is}} because the Nochiya Tribes presence in the region predates these international borders, and because they were not consulted or considered when these international borders were drawn through their lands, similar to <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States often drew state borders through Native American tribal territory. The Turkey-Iran border was created in 1515 after the Battle of Chaldiran split the Targawar, Bagzadeh and Margawar Clans away from the central Şemdinli district in Turkey, with the Nochiyaye lands within the Zagros mountain range {{in the eastern part of}} their territory becoming part of Iran literally overnight. The Turkey-Iraq border was created in 1926, with the signing of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, and cut away the Bradost, Rawanduz, and Sherwan Clans from the Shamizdin district in Turkey. However, at this point, no Nochiyaye even live within the heart of their territory in Shamizdin anymore.|$|E

Special Operation units SO1 and SO14 merged in April 2015, to form RaSP (Royalty and Specialist Protection) which provides the roles above. The Diplomatic Protection Group (DPG) is responsible for providing armed officers that guard important residences such as Downing Street, but not Buckingham Palace and other palaces, as RaSP provides this. The Special Escort Group (SEG) are responsible for escorting the Royal Family, Prime Minister and other ministers, ambassadors and visiting heads of state, and occasionally prisoner transport. They use motorbikes to halt traffic, and use armed cars {{at the rear of}} the escort for armed assistance and traffic control. Once the escort has passed, the roads are immediately opened, different to <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States handle police escorts, which tend to close the road off completely. All SEG officers are armed, even the motorbike officers which utilize the Glock 17, and the car officers which utilize the more effective firearms such as the G36 and MP5 semi-automatic carbines.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, General Motors was {{concerned}} about <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would test the Volt to determine its official fuel economy rating. The controversy centered on whether, by including a gasoline engine, the Volt should be classified as a hybrid rather than an electric car as claimed by General Motors. If tested with the same EPA tests used by other hybrids, the Volt's EPA fuel economy rating would be around [...] due to the current EPA test for hybrids disallowing vehicles from boosting their mpg rating using stored battery power. General Motors stated that the Volt is an entirely new type of vehicle which the EPA's current fuel economy tests were not suited to rate and that a new test should be devised for this emerging class of hybrid-electrics. General Motors also advocated for a more simplified mpg calculation method {{to take into account}} the range of a plug-in hybrid while running solely on electricity. Because the Volt can travel [...] on batteries alone, GM argued that most drivers with a daily commute of less than that distance would drive only in electric mode, so long as they recharged their vehicle at work or at home overnight.|$|E
