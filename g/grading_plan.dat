Based on calculations of expected daily trips, turning movement analysis, and Highway Capacity Software analysis, the new site plan is designed to optimize parking spaces, landscaped areas, and access. Along with a newly designed <b>grading</b> <b>plan,</b> a hydrological flood analysis was done to design underground stormwater storage tanks and the final <b>grading</b> <b>plan.</b> The building itself was designed as a steel-braced moment frame designed to support gravity, wind, and seismic loading per the LRFD procedure. Utilizing the LRFD critical load combination the most economical size of structural members including beams, columns, girders, lateral bracing, and connections where chosen. The design was then entered into SAP 2000 to model the building behavior. Given the column loads and soil properties, the site s soil bearing capacity was calculated to design isolated footings with reinforcing tensile rebar.

40|$|Preparing the <b>grading</b> <b>plan</b> of {{the side}} slopes on a highway section is an {{effective}} way to obtain an overall three-dimensional view of the entire design area, and a design fitting the roadside topography. Flattening the slope on the ends where the cut or fill is light and gradually steepening it toward the controlling maximum is suggested by the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in order to achieve a smooth appearance. In the present technical note a method to obtain this goal is proposed and applied to a highway's cut area. Depending on the slope's height two different slope ratios are used. Cut slopes are rounded using a parabolic curve with a vertical axis centered on the point of intersection of the original ground surface and the backslope. The length of the curve is determined according to the slope height. The method suggested in the present technical note is a simple and effective way to produce a successful sideslope grading design...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Remediation of the South Fork Couer d’Alene River {{floodplain}} (the Flats) in Smelterville, Idaho, {{offered a}} unique opportunity to test ecological restoration theories regarding the relationship between plant community establishment and abiotic environmental conditions. Successful re-creation of the abiotic environment is the primary consideration for restoration of a given plant community type. Failure associated with many wetland restoration projects can often be traced to inappropriate soils and hydrologic conditions for the target community. This paper reports the preliminary results of an 80 ha floodplain restoration project that occurred without artificial replanting of herbaceous wetland plant communities. Over 760, 000 cubic meters of tailings-contaminated materials were removed from the floodplain. Ground-water modeling prior to excavation and re-grading served as the basis for developing post-excavation <b>grading</b> <b>plans.</b> <b>Grading</b> was coupled with placement of 15 cm of high quality native topsoil. Coversoils required relatively little amending following placement and establishment of final grades. No herbaceous wetland plants were installe...|$|R

40|$|The {{scope of}} the UA Civil Engineering Senior Design Capstone spans the {{different}} disciplines of the field including structural, geotechnical, hydrological and transportation engineering, while providing {{students the opportunity to}} apply their education to collaboratively design a realistic property development. Following this central goal, a team of civil engineering students each assumed the responsibilities of one of the four different disciplines and coordinated design efforts to establish a feasible project. The following capstone report focuses on the design of a property located in Oro Valley, AZ which is currently undeveloped and borders three other properties that were assigned to other capstone groups. As a part of the engineering report, the applicable zoning code requirements of the town of Oro Valley had to be followed while taking local traffic analysis and site hydrology into account.

30|$|Although the {{production}} data {{used in the}} paper are from special CBM areas, the general guidelines suggested in this paper do not alter with the data. When practicing the suggested method, the government can set a benchmark for the parameter values and the corresponding <b>grading</b> <b>plans</b> and subsidy levels. For example, suppose that the benchmark gas price is set at 1.5  CNY/m 3, and the corresponding subsidy amount is 0.3  CNY/m 3, the subsidy amount will be decreased to 0.2  CNY/m 3 when the gas price increases by 0.1  CNY/m 3. It is obvious that a differential subsidy policy can perform better than the existing one, even if the method of grading resources deployed for the policy is not perfect.|$|R
30|$|Differences {{were also}} found between {{elementary}} and middle school students, but only in homework planning. Elementary school students had higher results in planning when compared with middle school students. This result may reflect the progressive decreasing in the involvement in the studying activities and in the positive attitudes towards homework as the students advance in the educational system (Rosário et al., 2005). Hong et al. (2009) had also found that students from the 11 th <b>grade</b> <b>planned</b> homework less than the 7 th grade students. Taken together, these and our results can indicate that homework planning decreases as the school grade increases and that this decrease starts at early stages, but this hypothesis must be investigated using a longitudinal design in the future.|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} the {{development}} of a design for a proposed reading garden and educational playscape at the main branch of the Hancock County Public Library (HCPL) in Greenfield, IN. The problem addressed is building reading skill and interest and understanding of the environment throughout the community. The focus of the educational playscape is reading and environmental education for children ranging from preschool age to 12 th grade. The focus of the reading garden is to reignite reading interest in adults and older teens and connect the Greenfield community to their literary history. The site was designed to serve as an additional patch habitat for migratory water fowl and other transient wildlife, with the intent of educating visitors on the habitat needs of wildlife. A site plan, <b>grading</b> <b>plan,</b> planting plan, and site details were generated as part of this project. The final design addresses the above listed needs through an Authors' Walk with art installations, a reading garden, two playscapes, and a naturalized retention pond. The project location is the main branch of the Hancock County Public Library in Greenfield, IN. The library property is an eleven acre site, the southern half of which is already in use while the northern half is a field of weeds.
