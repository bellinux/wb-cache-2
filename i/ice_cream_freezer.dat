50|$|The modern {{design of}} {{industrial}} <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>freezers</b> ensures {{a high level}} of machine/operator interface and top quality of the produced ice cream.The manufacturing process of <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> production includes pasteurization, homogenization and maturation of the <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> mixture. The prepared mixture enters into the industrial double tube scraped crystallizer - heat exchanger, in which the processes of pre-freezing and churning of <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> are carried out. A refrigerant fluid evaporates and continually circulates in a vessel jacket.Usually, the initial temperature of an <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> mixture is 12-18 °C. After switching on a freezer, an evaporating temperature of a refrigerant decreases down to a range from −25 to −32 °C. The final temperature of the treated mixture into the scraped surface freezer is about −5 °C, with an ice concentration of approximately 30-50%, depending on the formula. During the freezing process ice crystals form on the inside cool surface of the crystallizer wall. They are removed by blades, mixed into the bulk, and continue to decrease its temperature and to improve heat transfer within the product.|$|R

40|$|Dietary fiber is {{currently}} {{added to a}} wide range of commercial food products including dairy, baked goods, and some frozen desserts. Different types of dietary fiber have different properties and functions when used in food. The most basic categories of dietary fiber are soluble and insoluble. Our objective was to determine if an acceptable frozen yogurt product supplemented with dietary fiber could be produced. Three different types of dietary fiber were used: Frutafit TEX! (inulin), Glucagel� (betaglucan), and Vitacel SMOOV 240 (cellulose). These three were used at the 3 %, 5 % and 7 % levels in the frozen yogurt. Frozen yogurt base was manufactured using nonfat milk, heavy cream, sugar, corn syrup solids, nonfat dry milk, stabilizer, water, and vanilla. The base was mixed with yogurt (ratio of 80 : 20) that had been cultured from nonfat milk, and a yogurt culture containing Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Fiber was weighed and blended with the base before the yogurt was added. Vanilla flavoring was added, and the treatments were frozen using a batch <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>freezer.</b> Microbiological enumeration was conducted on the treatments before being frozen. Titratable acidity and pH were also measured on the treatments before and after being frozen.

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science Institute, Human NutritionDelores H. ChambersFresh mangoes {{are highly}} perishable, and therefore, {{they are often}} {{processed}} to extend shelf-life and facilitate exportation. Studying the transformation that mango cultivars undergo throughout processing can aid in selecting appropriate varieties for products. In the 1 st part of this study, the flavor and texture properties of 4 mango cultivars available in the United States (U. S.) were analyzed. Highly trained descriptive panelists in the U. S. evaluated fresh, purée, and sorbet samples prepared from each cultivar. Purées were made by pulverizing mango flesh, passing it through a china cap, and heating it to 85 °C for 15 s. For the sorbets, purées were diluted with water (1 : 1), sucrose was added, and the bases were frozen in a batch <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>freezer.</b> Much of the texture variation among cultivars was lost after fresh samples were transformed into purées, whereas much of the flavor and texture variation among cultivars was lost once fresh mangoes and mango purées were transformed into sorbets. Compared to the other cultivars, Haden and Tommy Atkins underwent greater transformations in flavor throughout sorbet preparation, and processing reduced the intensities of some unpleasant flavors in these cultivars. Tommy Atkins was the only cultivar that had flavor differences from other cultivars when it was in sorbet. Results suggest that cultivar variation is generally not detectable in mango sorbet unless the cultivar has a distinct initial flavor. In the 2 nd part of this study, descriptive panelists in Thailand evaluated the flavor and texture properties of fresh samples and purées prepared from 6 cultivars grown in Thailand. Thermal processing had unique effects on the flavor of each cultivar, especially Nam Dok Mai and Chok Anun; Nam Dok Mai significantly decreased in mango identity and peach flavors after processing, whereas Chok Anun significantly increased in sweet, mango identity, and pineapple flavors. Although a slight amount of flavor variation among cultivars was lost because of thermal processing, most of the texture variation was eliminated. Because of significant changes in flavor and texture after heat treatment of mango cultivars, manufacturers should select cultivars for mango purées based on their properties after thermal processing...|$|E
50|$|Iron is {{more prone}} to rusting than (tinned) copper. Cast iron kitchen utensils, in particular, are however less prone to rust if, instead of being scoured to a shine after use, they are simply washed with {{detergent}} and water and wiped clean with a cloth, allowing the utensil to form a coat of (already corroded iron and other) material that then acts to prevent further corrosion (a process known as seasoning). Furthermore, if an iron utensil is solely used for frying or cooking with fat or oil, corrosion can be reduced by never heating water with it, never using it to cook with water, and when washing it with water to dry it immediately afterwards, removing all water. Since oil and water are immiscible, since oils and fats are more covalent compounds, and since it is ionic compounds such as water that promote corrosion, eliminating as much contact with water reduces corrosion. For some iron kitchen utensils, water is a particular problem, since {{it is very difficult}} to dry them fully. In particular, iron egg-beaters or <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>freezers</b> are tricky to dry, and the consequent rust if left wet will roughen them and possibly clog them completely. When storing iron utensils for long periods, van Rensselaer recommended coating them in non-salted (since salt is also an ionic compound) fat or paraffin.|$|R

40|$|Unilever is {{planning}} to expand its <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> production based on current conditions in China. Produc-tion expansion means increasing demands of raw materials e. g. milk powders, and requirements of energy use for processing, transporting and storing. From producing fresh milk for milk powders till storing <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> in <b>freezer</b> cabinets, the <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> chain implies large amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As a multi-national corporation with strong social responsibilities {{and one of the}} leading <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> manufacturers in China, Unilever would like to assess and mitigate GHG emissions from the perspective of <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> supply chain. Carbon footprint is the term applied in the study to evaluate global warming potential (GWP) of <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> chain. Unilever has done several relevant researches focusing on Europe. Due to data and information gaps between available approaches over European production and China’s conditions, this study was con-ducted through dividing its whole chain into several stages from dairy cows on farms till storage at selling points. Mass balance approach and scenario analyses were used to gain insight into the climate impacts hotspots of the <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> chain for Unilever in China. In the meanwhile, an overview of sub-systems concerned in the study, e. g. dairy farming systems and milking systems, was concisely ex-plained. Next to that, integrated scenario results were shown over what the carbon footprint of one litre <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> is, and what options could decrease it. Overall, the carbon footprint of <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> (only based on milk, excluding other ingredients) in China is 1. 2 - 1. 8 kg CO 2 equivalent per litre and energy use is 5. 8 - 10. 5 MJ per litre. Three stages of milk production on farms, manufacturing in plants and storing at selling points were found to be the GHG hotspots of the chain. The GWP mainly resulted from fossil fuels combustion for transportation and generation of electricity after the farm-gate. Carbon dioxide is the main GHG which has a significant influence on and contributes about 80 % to the total carbon footprint. Distributing <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> to selling points with various distances may result in more emissions. Considering the complexity, general conclusions with regard to mitigating GHG emissions of the <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> chain were drawn. Therefore, the most effective and pragmatic measures to decrease the cli-mate impact of <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> from the perspective of <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> chain for Unilever would be the follow-ing: mitigating the GHG emissions from dairy farms through effective manure management, replacing utilization of milk powders with liquid milk, planning the point of manufacturing to market served, and transforming energy mix through utilization of green energy,. This study did not come up with concrete policy recommendations but rather identifies a number of issues that merit further tailor-made investigations based on practical conditions in China. It will also contribute to a more detailed debate on policy proposals within different divisions of Unilever. ...|$|R
