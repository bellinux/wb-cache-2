25|$|The {{widespread}} use of such types of GM soybeans in the Americas has caused problems with exports to some regions. GM crops require extensive certification {{before they can be}} legally imported into the European Union, where there is considerable supplier and consumer reluctance to use GM products for consumer or animal use. Difficulties with coexistence and subsequent traces of cross-contamination of non-GM stocks have caused shipments to be rejected and <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> premium on non-GM soy.|$|E
25|$|Early {{transportation}} to Newport had relied mainly on rail, with trains from Albany arriving at Yaquina City, where passengers could board a ferryboat to Yaquina Bay. Optimism for Newport's early growth {{was based on}} the expectation that the railway would eventually reach Newport. It never did. In 1928, the Southern Pacific Railroad stopped service to Yaquina City. This may <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> temporary damper on the tourist business, but by 1930 highway projects were underway that would make the area more accessible than ever.|$|E
25|$|One of the Copenhagen Consensus panel experts later distanced {{himself from}} {{the way in which}} the Consensus results have been {{interpreted}} in the wider debate. Thomas Schelling now thinks that it was misleading to put climate change at the bottom of the priority list. The Consensus panel members were presented with a dramatic proposal for handling climate change. If given the opportunity, Schelling would <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> more modest proposal higher on the list. The Yale economist Robert O. Mendelsohn was the official critic of the proposal for climate change during the Consensus. He thought the proposal was way out of the mainstream and could only be rejected. Mendelsohn worries that climate change was set up to fail.|$|E

25|$|An early {{influence}} of the War on artists in the United Kingdom was the recruiting campaign of 1914-1915. Around a hundred posters were commissioned from artists by the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee of which {{two and a half}} million copies were distributed across the country. Private companies also sponsored recruitment posters: Remember Belgium, by the Belgian-born Frank Brangwyn and The Only Road for an Englishman by Gerald Spencer Pryse were two notable examples produced on behalf of the London Electric Railways. Although Brangwyn produced over 80 poster designs during the War, he was not an official war artist. His grim poster of a Tommy bayoneting an enemy soldier (“Put Strength in the Final Blow: Buy War Bonds”) caused deep offence in both Britain and Germany. The Kaiser himself is said to <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> price on Brangwyn’s head after seeing the image.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his body}} being {{identified}} by police and a priest before being burnt, {{there have also}} been stories that both Dan and Steve survived the fire. There is little evidence to support these claims. One man, James Ryan, said he was Dan Kelly. In 1934 he went on stage at the Brisbane Exhibition and told stories about the Kelly Gang. He died on 29 July 1948, after being struck by a train. The Ipswich City Council <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> memorial on his grave. In 2001, scientists took a small piece of bone from the grave of Charles Devine Tindall at Toowoomba, Queensland, {{to see if they could}} find DNA to prove he was Dan Kelly. Devine, who had burn scars on his body, told his family he was really Dan. He said he had hidden under the floor of the Glenrowan hotel and escaped after the fire. An archaeological dig at the site of the hotel by Adam Ford in 2008 found that there was no cellar or other hiding place under the floors. In October 1902, a Melbourne newspaper printed a story that Dan Kelly and Steve Hart were living in South Africa. The men had fought in the Boer War. Another man, Jim Davis from Darra (a suburb of Brisbane, Queensland), said in 1938 that he was Dan Kelly. He claimed that he, Steve Hart and Joe Byrne had escaped from the hotel. He also said he was born at the Eureka Stockade in 1854, which makes him too old to have really been Dan.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the events}} of Final Fantasy Tactics, the Fara church {{dominated}} the kingdom of Ivalice. The remake of Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions, refers to the Fara Church as Pharism.

Glabados is monotheistic and intensely political, underscoring much of Ivalice history. Followers of Glabados use the word [...] "Faram" [...] to affirm their prayers.

They were similar to the {{preceding}} Braunschweig-class ships—Deutschland was nearly identical, though the design was modified slightly after the lead ship was laid down. The four subsequent ships had a somewhat different boiler arrangement and slightly thicker armor compared to the Braunschweig-class ships. All five vessels of the Deutschland class dispensed with the turret mountings for the secondary [...] guns; all of these guns were mounted in casemates in the hull. The ships were built despite rumors of {{the capabilities of the}} revolutionary [...] then under construction.

500|$|Following the {{appearance}} of Arthur Curry, which {{became one of the}} highest rated episodes of that season, Smallville developers Al Gough and Miles Millar began work on an Aquaman pilot for The WB Television Network, with Justin Hartley as Arthur Curry. As work progressed on season five's [...] "Aqua", the character was recognized to have potential for his own series. The season five episode was never meant to be a backdoor pilot for an Aquaman television spin-off, so Alan Ritchson was never considered for the role. Gough stated in a November 2005 interview that the series would <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> different spin on the Aquaman mythology. Although Gough did not look at the new series as a true spin-off, he did suggest an interest in doing a crossover with Smallville. Aquaman is currently the only series to go into production, though it was ultimately not picked up by The CW network, which had formed from a merger between The WB and UPN during the production of the pilot.|$|E

Nevertheless, North Korea launched the rocket anyway, claiming the satellite was purely intended for peaceful, scientific purposes. Several nations, including the United States, Japan, and South Korea, have criticized the launch, and despite North Korean claims that the rocket was for peaceful purposes, it has been heavily criticized as an attempt to perform an ICBM test under the guise of a peaceful satellite launch. China also criticized the launch, however urged [...] "the relevant parties" [...] to [...] "refrain from taking actions that may further escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula".|$|E

2500|$|If a large {{population}} of pacu enters an ecosystem {{to which it is}} not native, the fish can have a very adverse effect. Pet stores sell pacu as small as [...] long and neglect to warn customers that fish growth is not inhibited by tank size, contrary to popular fish lore. [...] "Most UK dealers now refuse to stock this species due to the large size and expensive aquarium requirements it demands," [...] according to Practical Fishkeeping magazine's Matt Clarke. Incapable of maintaining large aquaria, overwhelmed hobbyists are suspected of illegally releasing their pacu into wild waterways. As tropical fish, pacu will die in cold weather; as newcomers to an ecosystem, pacu may out-compete native species for available food, habitat, and other resources, or displace them by introducing exotic parasites or diseases. Most wildlife resource authorities prohibit releasing exotic fish, including pacu, into the wild. Officials of one Texas lake <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> $100 bounty on the pacu caught there.|$|E
2500|$|The New York Times {{reported}} on July 9, 2008, that Dale Rathke, {{the brother of}} ACORN's founder Wade Rathke, {{was found to have}} embezzled $948,607.50 from the group and affiliated charitable organizations in 1999 and 2000. ACORN executives decided to handle it as an internal matter, and did not inform most of the board members or law enforcement, and instead signed an enforceable restitution agreement with the Rathke family to repay the amount of the embezzlement. $210,000 has already been repaid, and a donor, Drummond Pike, has offered to pay the remaining debt. The Times reported that, according to Wade Rathke, [...] "the decision to keep the matter secret was not made to protect his brother but because word of the embezzlement would <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> 'weapon' into the hands of enemies of ACORN, a liberal group that is a frequent target of conservatives who object to ACORN's often strident advocacy on behalf of low- and moderate-income families and workers."
