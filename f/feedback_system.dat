5|$|Glucocorticoids {{are under}} the {{regulatory}} influence of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Glucocorticoid synthesis is stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a hormone released into the bloodstream by the anterior pituitary. In turn, production of ACTH is stimulated {{by the presence of}} corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is released by neurons of the hypothalamus. ACTH acts on the adrenal cells first by increasing the levels of StAR within the cells, and then of all steroidogenic P450 enzymes. The HPA axis {{is an example of a}} negative <b>feedback</b> <b>system,</b> in which cortisol itself acts as a direct inhibitor of both CRH and ACTH synthesis. The HPA axis also interacts with the immune system through increased secretion of ACTH at the presence of certain molecules of the inflammatory response.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the hormones}} in the {{anterior}} pituitary are {{each part of}} an axis that is regulated by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus secretes a number of releasing hormones, often according to a circadian rhythm, into blood vessels that supply the anterior pituitary; {{most of these are}} stimulatory (thyrotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone and growth hormone-releasing hormone), apart from dopamine, which suppresses prolactin production. In response to the releasing hormone rate, the anterior pituitary produces its hormones (TSH, ACTH, LH, FSH, GH) which in turn stimulate effector hormone glands in the body, while prolactin (PRL) acts directly on the breast gland. Once the effector glands produce sufficient hormones (thyroxine, cortisol, estradiol or testosterone and IGF-1), both the hypothalamus and the pituitary cells sense their abundance and reduce their secretion of stimulating hormones. The hormones of the posterior pituitary are produced in the hypothalamus and are carried by nerve endings to the posterior lobe; their <b>feedback</b> <b>system</b> is therefore located in the hypothalamus, but damage to the nerve endings would still lead to a deficiency in hormone release.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the strong}} (i.e., unity gain) {{feedback}} and certain non-ideal characteristics of real operational amplifiers, this <b>feedback</b> <b>system</b> is prone to have poor stability margins. Consequently, the system may be unstable when connected to sufficiently capacitive loads. In these cases, a lag compensation network (e.g., connecting the load to the voltage follower through a resistor) {{can be used to}} restore stability. The manufacturer data sheet for the operational amplifier may provide guidance for the selection of components in external compensation networks. Alternatively, another operational amplifier can be chosen that has more appropriate internal compensation.|$|E
25|$|An {{unstable}} water jet, {{similar to}} the one shown in the flow instability section above, was not disturbed deliberately, but was allowed to rise to a free water surface. On contact with the surface, a slight jet asymmetry caused an unsymmetrical raised surface that fed back to the jet origin and began a process that looked like a weak version of the flow instability figure. If the jet was not powered, but warmer than the surrounding fluid, it would rise and when encountering the surface would generate a similar <b>feedback</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pharaoh ants use a {{positive}} <b>feedback</b> <b>system</b> of foraging. Each morning, scouts will search for food. When one finds it, it will instantly {{return to the}} nest. This causes several ants to follow the successful scout’s trail back to the food source. Soon, a large group will be upon the food. Scouts are thought to use both chemical and visual cues to remain aware of the nest location and find their way. If the colony is exploring a new region, they employ a land rush tactic, in which {{a large number of}} foragers randomly search, constantly releasing pheromones.|$|E

The primary contributions of this book lie in two aspects: the newly-proposed information-theoretic measures and the newly-discovered control performance limitations. We first propose a number of information notions to facilitate the analysis. Using those notions, classes of performance limitations of networked <b>feedback</b> <b>systems,</b> as well as state estimation systems, are then investigated. In general, the book presents a unique, cohesive treatment of performance limitation issues of networked <b>feedback</b> <b>systems</b> via an information-theoretic approach.

25|$|The {{continuous}} interplay (exchange or trade) done {{by economic}} actors in all markets sets the prices for all {{goods and services}} which, in turn, make the rational managing of scarce resources possible. At the same time, the decisions (choices) made by the same actors, while they are pursuing their own interest, determine the level of output (production), consumption, savings, and investment, in an economy, {{as well as the}} remuneration (distribution) paid to the owners of labour (in the form of wages), capital (in the form of profits) and land (in the form of rent). Each period, as if they were in a giant <b>feedback</b> <b>system,</b> economic players influence the pricing processes and the economy, and are in turn influenced by them until a steady state (equilibrium) of all variables involved is reached or until an external shock throws the system toward a new equilibrium point. Because of the autonomous actions of rational interacting agents, the economy is a complex adaptive system.|$|E
25|$|In the female, {{estradiol}} acts as {{a growth}} hormone for tissue of the reproductive organs, supporting {{the lining of the}} vagina, the cervical glands, the endometrium, and the lining of the fallopian tubes. It enhances growth of the myometrium. Estradiol appears necessary to maintain oocytes in the ovary. During the menstrual cycle, estradiol produced by the growing follicles triggers, via a positive <b>feedback</b> <b>system,</b> the hypothalamic-pituitary events that lead to the luteinizing hormone surge, inducing ovulation. In the luteal phase, estradiol, in conjunction with progesterone, prepares the endometrium for implantation. During pregnancy, estradiol increases due to placental production. The effect of estradiol, together with estrone and estriol, in pregnancy is less clear. They may promote uterine blood flow, myometrial growth, stimulate breast growth and at term, promote cervical softening and expression of myometrial oxytocin receptors. In baboons, blocking of estrogen production leads to pregnancy loss, suggesting estradiol has a role in the maintenance of pregnancy. Research is investigating the role of estrogens in the process of initiation of labor. Actions of estradiol are required before the exposure of progesterone in the luteal phase.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Dither {{signals are}} {{commonly}} used to compensate for nonlinearities in <b>feedback</b> <b>systems</b> in electronics and mechanics. Recently, theoretical results were proposed {{for the analysis of}} a particularly interesting class of nonsmooth <b>systems,</b> namely relay <b>feedback</b> <b>systems</b> with triangular dither. In this paper the class of dither signals is enlarged by considering square and trapezoidal dither: it is shown how the dither shape affects the behavior of nonsmooth <b>feedback</b> <b>systems,</b> differently from the case of dither in Lipschitz continuous systems.

500|$|Each puppet's {{head was}} fitted with about 10 thin {{tungsten}} steel wires. During the filming, dialogue was played {{into the studio}} using modified tape recorders that converted the feed into electronic pulses. Two of the wires relayed these pulses to the internal solenoid, completing the Supermarionation process. The wires, which were sprayed black to reduce their visibility, were made even less noticeable {{through the application of}} powder paint that matched the background colours of the set. Glanville explained the time-consuming nature of this process: [...] " [...] used to spend over half an hour on each shot getting rid of these wires, looking through the camera, puffing a bit more [...] here, anti-flare there; and, I mean, it's very depressing when somebody will say to us, 'Of course the wires showed.'"

2500|$|An {{inverted}} pendulum is {{a pendulum}} {{that has its}} center of mass above its pivot point. It is often implemented with the pivot point mounted on a cart that can move horizontally and may be called a cart and pole {{as shown in the}} photo. Most applications limit the pendulum to 1 degree of freedom by affixing the pole to an axis of rotation. Whereas a normal pendulum is stable when hanging downwards, an inverted pendulum is inherently unstable, and must be actively balanced in order to remain upright; this can be done either by applying a torque at the pivot point, by moving the pivot point horizontally as part of a <b>feedback</b> <b>system,</b> changing the rate of rotation of a mass mounted on the pendulum on an axis parallel to the pivot axis and thereby generating a net torque on the pendulum, or by oscillating the pivot point vertically. A simple demonstration of moving the pivot point in a <b>feedback</b> <b>system</b> is achieved by balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of one's finger. [...] The inverted pendulum is a classic problem in dynamics and control theory and is used as a benchmark for testing control strategies.|$|E
