40|$|Current {{efforts to}} {{determine}} the complete nucleotide sequence of the six murine and human T-cell receptor (TCR) loci are limited by the availability of overlapping genomic inserts cloned into a defined and characterized vector. In order to create these mapping and sequencing libraries, our laboratory has modified an existing cosmid vector pWE 15 (1, 2). The optimized version, pWE 15 A (3), contains a polylinker with 15 infrequently cleaved restriction enzyme sites, asymmetrically centered around the BamHI site, which is the cloning site used for the insertion of the genomic DNA described below. The modifications allow recovery of inserted DNA {{by the use of}} several restriction enzymes.

40|$|The cybernetic {{framework}} {{developed by}} Ramkrishna and coworkers is extended to metabolic engineering. A conceptual methodology is formulated that affords both {{the description of}} the regulation of arbitrarily complex metabolic networks as well as local genetic alterations to network structure. Additionally, a metabolic design framework is conceived in which Metabolic Control Analysis is applied to cybernetic models to yield sensitivity measurements that are directly cognizant of network regulation. This understanding is employed in the analysis of two realistic pathway systems, namely, the penicillin V biosynthetic network and the aspartate family of amino acids. In both cases cybernetic models describing the time evolution of the metabolic network are constructed and analyzed to determine likely routes genetic manipulation that yield performance enhancements. ^ Secondly, continuous biocatalysis of heterologous products is explored. Continuous operation of recombinant microorganisms is often impossible because of genetic instability. The outward manifestation of this phenomena is the loss of <b>insert</b> <b>bearing</b> population as a function of time. From a productivity standpoint continuous reactor operation would be the preferred operational route in the absence of such instabilities. Consequently, a conceptual cybernetic model describing the biocatalysis of heterologous products is formulated and analyzed to determine qualitative strategies that can be employed to eliminate genetic instability. These strategies take the form of the rational design of plasmid characteristics and promoter configuration as well as the formulation of nonlinear reactor control systems designed to control the level of <b>insert</b> <b>bearing</b> biomass in the reactor. ^ Lastly, we focus upon the more conceptual exercise of formulating guidelines that afford rational construction of cybernetic models. One of the conceptual roadblocks hindering the application of cybernetic models to nonlinear bioreactor control has been the issue of model formulation. The formulation of appropriately abstracted cybernetic models of microbial processes has proven difficult, in the past, using an entirely first principles approach. Accordingly, we present a set of postulates that have been formulated using tools from bifurcation theory that allow the rational formulation of cybernetic models, such that the model framework is guaranteed to possess desired behavioral characteristics. Three example models are formulated and analyzed using the abstraction procedure. ...|$|E
40|$|Rpb 5 -H 147 R is an AT-GC {{transition}} replacing CAC(His) by CGC(Arg) at a conserved {{and critical}} position of ABC 27 (Rpb 5 p), {{one of the}} five common and essential subunits shared by all three eukaryotic RNA polymerases. This mutation is viable at 25 degrees C, but has a lethal phenotype at 34 degrees C. A search for dosage-dependent suppressors identified five distinct clones that all bear a copy of the tRNA(His) GUG gene. Suppression was also observed with a small genomic <b>insert</b> <b>bearing</b> this tRNA gene and no other coding sequences, under conditions where there is a sevenfold increase in the cellular concentration of tRNA(His) GUG. Overexpressing tRNA(Arg) ICG, which normally decodes the suppressed CGC codon, counteracted suppression. Suppression is codon specific because it was abolished when replacing CGC by its synonymous codons CGA, CGU, or AGA, but was not detectably affected by several nucleotide substitutions modifying the surrounding sequence and is thus largely insensitive to the nucleotide context. It is proposed that overexpressing tRNA(His) GUG extends its decoding properties from CAC(His) to the noncognate CGC(Arg) codon through an illegitimate U x G pairing at the middle base of the anticodon. Accordingly, tRNA(His) GUG would compete with tRNA(Arg) ICG for chain elongation and generate a significant level of misreading errors under normal growth conditions...|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} a screening approach that utilizes an inverse {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) to detect P element insertions in or near previously cloned genes in Drosophila melanogaster. We used this approach {{in a large scale}} genetic screen in which P elements were mobilized from sites on the X chromosome to new autosomal locations. Mutagenized flies were combined in pools, and our screening approach was used to generate probes corresponding to the sequences flanking each site of insertion. These probes then were used for hybridization to cloned genomic intervals, allowing individuals carrying insertions in them to be detected. We used the same approach to perform repeated rounds of sib-selection to generate stable insertion lines. We screened 16, 100 <b>insert</b> <b>bearing</b> individuals and recovered 11 insertions in five intervals containing genes encoding members of the kinesin superfamily in Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, we recovered an insertion in the region including the Larval Serum Protein- 2 gene. Examination by Southern hybridization confirms that the lines we recovered represent genuine insertions in the corresponding genomic intervals. Our data indicates that this approach will be very efficient both for P element mutagenesis of new genomic regions and for detection and recovery of ``local'' P element transposition events. In addition, our data constitutes a survey of preferred P element insertion sites in the Drosophila genome and suggests that insertion sites that are mutable at a rate of ~ 10 (- 4) are distributed every 40 - 50 kb...|$|E
40|$|The {{mean average}} life is increasing; therefore, {{there is a}} need to {{increase}} the lifetime of the prostheses. To fulfil this requirement, new prosthetic designs and materials are being introduced. Two of the design parameters that may affect wear of total knee replacements, and hence the expected lifetime, are the insert conformity and material. Computational models have been used extensively for wear prediction and optimisation of artificial knee designs. The objective of the present study was to use a previously validated non-dimensional wear coefficient-based computational wear model to investigate the effect of insert conformity and material on the predicted wear in total knee replacements. Four different inserts (curved, lipped, partial flat and custom flat), with different conformity levels, were tested against the same femoral and under two different kinematic inputs (intermediate and high), with different levels of cross-shear. The <b>insert</b> <b>bearing</b> materials were either conventional or moderately cross-linked ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Wear predictions were validated against the experimental data from Leeds knee simulation tests. The predicted wear rates for the curved insert (most conformed) were more than three times those for the flat insert (least conformed). In addition, the computationally predicted average volumetric wear rates for moderately cross-linked UHMWPE bearings were less than half of their corresponding conventional UHMWPE bearings. Moreover, the wear of the moderately cross-linked UHMWPE was shown to be less dependent on the degree of cross-shear, compared to conventional UHMWPE. These results along with supporting experimental studies provide insight into the design variables, which may reduce wear in knee replacements...|$|E

40|$|AbstractQuick {{monitoring}} of the axial force of hangers of a suspension or a cable-stayed bridge are of significant importance since large vehicle loads may have affected, if not changed, the axial forces along {{the life cycle of}} the bridges. The axial force formulae do not consider changes of support type and shape of hangers with increasing axially tensile or compressive loads. Such changes may, theoretically, have lead to inaccurate axial force predictions. This study focused on predicting the axial force of models with different L/d ratios of solid circular cross section upon pinned-pinned supports using vibration techniques. The lengths of the specimens were 101. 2 cm and 139. 5 cm, measured from the centre to centre of the supports, and the diameter of both specimens was 24. 9 mm. Pinned-pinned type of supports and various axially tensile and compressive loads were applied. The supports were designed and manufactured so as to comply with ideal pinned-pinned conditions by <b>inserting</b> <b>bearings</b> of 10 ton capacity inside the confining system. In every applied load the time domain vibration signals were recorded and the natural frequencies were analyzed by means of the Fourier transformation technique. The experimental results show that the increasing natural frequencies with increasing tensile loads, as well as the decreasing natural frequencies with increasing compressive loads, are in line with the theoretical prediction. The change of rotational support conditions (purely pinned to semi-fixed) at higher axially tensile forces especially for the slender beam (139. 5 cm) is blamed to cause higher first natural frequency predictions. On the contrary, both beams in compression (101. 2 cm and 139. 5 cm) indicate better conformity within 45 % of their critical loads (between experiment and theory).
