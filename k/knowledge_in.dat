40|$|AbstractOne of the {{strengths}} of rough set theory {{is the fact that}} an unknown target concept can be approximately characterized by existing <b>knowledge</b> structures <b>in</b> a <b>knowledge</b> base. <b>Knowledge</b> structures <b>in</b> <b>knowledge</b> bases have two categories: complete and incomplete. In this paper, through uniformly expressing these two kinds of knowledge structures, we first address four operators on a knowledge base, which are adequate for generating new knowledge structures through using known knowledge structures. Then, an axiom definition of <b>knowledge</b> granulation <b>in</b> <b>knowledge</b> bases is presented, under which some existing knowledge granulations become its special forms. Finally, we introduce the concept of a knowledge distance for calculating the difference between two <b>knowledge</b> structures <b>in</b> the same <b>knowledge</b> base. Noting that the knowledge distance satisfies the three properties of a distance space on all knowledge structures induced by a given universe. These results will be very helpful for knowledge discovery from knowledge bases and significant for establishing a framework of granular computing <b>in</b> <b>knowledge</b> bases...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - This {{qualitative}} {{case study}} examined the roles of internal factors (organizational, individual, technological and <b>knowledge</b> factors) <b>in</b> <b>knowledge</b> transfer <b>in</b> a context of a mobile wellness solutions start-up in Finland. In order to answer the main research question the role of internal factors {{in the use of}} <b>knowledge</b> sources, <b>in</b> <b>knowledge</b> conversion and <b>in</b> relationships were studied. Design/Methodology/approach - Ten (10) semi-structured interviews were made that followed the themes of the framework that was constructed for this study. Thematic coding was used to analyze the empirical data. Findings - The findings showed that the organizational and individual factors appeared to have the biggest roles in the ways <b>in</b> which <b>knowledge</b> sources were used, how knowledge was conversed and also in the relationships inside the start-up and between the start-up and it's B- 2 -B -customer - and thus <b>in</b> <b>knowledge</b> transfer. The roles of the technological and knowledge factors were seen also relevant in the use of <b>knowledge</b> sources and <b>in</b> <b>knowledge</b> conversion, but they did not seem to have a direct role in relationships. Nevertheless, it was recognized that especially the role of <b>knowledge</b> factors <b>in</b> relationships was indirect: The ways knowledge was conversed inside the start-up had a role in the relationships between companies. The findings suggest that the start-up could be able to transfer knowledge better by using more knowledge sources, by conversing knowledge with more diverse means, by building an organizational culture that recognizes the importance on knowledge and by building closer relationships between the companies. Theoretical contribution - The study forms a holistic understanding about the roles of internal factors <b>in</b> <b>knowledge</b> transfer <b>in</b> a start-up context. It fills in the gap of paucity of studies of knowledge management and organizational learning in the context of start-ups by offering new understanding and new insights to the theories...|$|R
