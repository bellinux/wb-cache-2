40|$|This {{study is}} to our {{knowledge}} the first to evaluate the potential of a wet electrostatic precipitator (WESP) to prevent aerosol formation issues inside amine based carbon <b>capture</b> <b>installations.</b> A WESP is a suitable option since this study proves {{that it is very}} efficient for the removal of the mist precursors inside the flue gas to be treated. Although a significant capital investment cost may be involved, energy requirements (i. e. low pressure drop), maintenance and therefore operational costs are expected to be very low. However, it is shown here that the WESP must be installed at the right location, i. e. the flue gas to be treated must contain no or very low levels of SO 2. The reason is that the WESP's aerosol removal efficiency decreases strongly in the presence of SO 2 gas and in a certain range also with increasing voltages. This limits the positive effect that the WESP has on reducing the MEA emissions from the absorber since a large number of mist formation precursors remain in the flue gas. In the presence of SO 2, a WESP can actually produce H 2 SO 4 aerosols. It is shown that these newly created aerosols are very small (low nanometre range). This information is very important for future pilot and demo amine carbon <b>capture</b> <b>installations</b> thinking of implementing a WESP as countermeasure to aerosol formation issues. It implies that no or very low levels of SO 2 should still be present in the flue gas before entering the WESP. Since most of the amine carbon <b>capture</b> <b>installations</b> have a pre-scrubber (usually using NaOH to remove residual SO 2 in the flue leaving the power plant's FGD) in front of their amine absorber, the WESP must be installed behind this pre-scrubber and not in front of it...|$|R
40|$|The key aims in {{research}} and development in the coal-fired power sector are improving the efficiency of electricity generation and reducing CO 2 emissions. Modern power systems require power units {{to be able to work}} flexibly at part loads with high efficiency. This paper presents a conceptual 900 MW coal-fired power unit. The unit operates with advanced ultra-supercritical (A-USC) steam parameters 35 MPa/ 700 ◦C and at 49 % net efficiency. Improved efficiency results in significantly reduced CO 2 emissions. Further emission reduction requires the integration of coal-fired power plants with CO 2 <b>capture</b> <b>installation.</b> A newly-built power plant offers the possibility of fully optimized integration to reduce efficiency loss, which is related to the post-combustion capture process. CO 2 capture by wet chemical absorption MEA can be characterized by three indicators: the demand for heat, electric power to drive auxiliary equipment and cooling. In order to calculate these indicators the capture process was modeled in Aspen Plus. Calculated indicators for nominal and part load operation were used to model an integrated power unit in Ebsilon Professional 10. 0.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{changes in the}} operating parameters of a combined gas-steam cycle with a CO 2 <b>capture</b> <b>installation</b> and flue gas recirculation. Parametric equations are solved in a purpose-built mathematical model of the system using the Ebsilon Professional code. Recirculated flue gases from the heat recovery boiler outlet, after being cooled and dried, are fed together with primary air into the mixer {{and then into the}} gas turbine compressor. This leads to an increase in carbon dioxide concentration in the flue gases fed into the CO 2 <b>capture</b> <b>installation</b> from 7. 12 to 15. 7 %. As a consequence, there is a reduction in the demand for heat in the form of steam extracted from the turbine for the amine solution regeneration in the CO 2 capture reactor. In addition, the flue gas recirculation involves a rise in the flue gas temperature (by 18 K) at the heat recovery boiler inlet and makes it possible to produce more steam. These changes contribute to an increase in net electricity generation efficiency by 1 %. The proposed model and the obtained results of numerical simulations are useful in the analysis of combined gas-steam cycles integrated with carbon dioxide separation from flue gases...|$|R

In this work, CO 2 capture from an FPSO turbine exhaust gas using a supersonic separator is investigated. To assess the operational performance of the capture process, a Laval nozzle (converging- diverging geometry) model is implemented and successfully integrated in a steady-state process flow sheet simulator. The model includes equilibrium thermodynamics describing freeze-out of dry ice from a gas mixture containing CO 2. To determine under which conditions this process is thermodynamically and fluid dynamically feasible, different boundary conditions are explored. By integrating the supersonic separator unit in a flow sheet model, the interaction between the capture and the rest of the process is studied. The results indicate that supersonic expansion is a viable strategy for capturing CO 2 from off-shore gas turbines...|$|R

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Capture-recapture {{models have}} been widely used to {{estimate}} the size of a target wildlife population. There are three major sources of variations that can affect capture probabilities: time (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>capture</b> probabilities vary with time or trapping occasion), behavioral response (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>capture</b> probabilities vary due to a trap response of animals to the first capture), and heterogeneity (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>capture</b> probabilities vary by individual animal). There are eight models regarding possible combinations of these factors, including M 0, Mt, Mb, Mh, Mtb, Mth, Mbh, and Mtbh. A capture-recapture model (Mb model) was created to present the behavioral response effect. The objective Bayesian analysis for the population size was developed and compared with common maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs). Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the objective Bayesian over MLEs. Two real examples about a deer mouse are presented and one R package (OBMbpkg) was built for application. Companion diagnostics (CDx) for personalized medicine is commonly applied to in vitro diagnostic (IVD) industry and clinical trials for specific disease or treatment with biomarkers (e. g. molecular targets). The Bayesian method with Gibbs sampler was used to estimate the potential bias caused by imperfect CDx under the targeted design, where only patients with a positive diagnosis were enrolled the clinical trials. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the Bayesian method and to compare with the EM algorithm. The Bayesian model selection method with G-prior was used to test treatment effects of targeted drugs for patients with biomarkers under the targeted design. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the Bayesian method and to compare it with the original method and EM method when sample size is small. Eventually a biomarker-stratified design was studied, while patients enrolled in clinical trials could be divided into two groups (i. e., those with a positive or negative diagnosis).
