50|$|<b>Ethylparaben</b> (ethyl para-hydroxybenzoate) is the {{ethyl ester}} of {{p-hydroxybenzoic}} acid. Its formula is HO-C6H4-CO-O-CH2CH3. It {{is a member}} of the class of compounds known as parabens.|$|E
50|$|Parabens are esters of para-hydroxybenzoic acid, {{from which}} the name is derived. Common {{parabens}} include methylparaben (E number E218), <b>ethylparaben</b> (E214), propylparaben (E216), butylparaben and heptylparaben (E209). Less common parabens include isobutylparaben, isopropylparaben, benzylparaben and their sodium salts. The general chemical structure of a paraben is shown at the top right of this page, where R symbolizes an alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl.|$|E
50|$|Butylparaben is weakly {{estrogen}}ic, {{meaning it}} mimics natural estrogen in the body. For example, parabens {{can bind to}} estrogen receptors and regulate estrogen responsive gene products in experimental cell systems. Long-chained parabens, like butylparaben, are more estrogenic than short-chained parabens, like methyl- or <b>ethylparaben.</b> This difference is attributed to the greater lipophilicity of the former. A scientific review found that butylparaben displayed the most competitive binding to rat estrogen receptors when tested along with methyl, ethyl, and propylparabens.|$|E

Parameters influencing the extraction efficiency, such as the type of extraction and dispersive solvent, the volume of extraction and dispersive solvent, salt effect, pH, extraction time, were optimized and resulted in enrichment factors (EFs) of 84 for methylparaben, 103 for <b>ethylparaben,</b> 115 for propylparaben and 126 for butylparaben. The limits of detection for parabens were 1. 52, 1. 06, 0. 32 and 0. 17 ng/mL, respectively. Excellent linearity with coefficients of correlation from 0. 9970 to 0. 9997 was observed in the concentration range of 5 – 1, 000 ng/mL.

40|$|Parabens are {{effective}} preservatives {{widely used in}} cosmetic products and processed food, with high human exposure. Recent evidence suggests that parabens exert estrogenic effects. This work investigated the potential interference of parabens with the estrogen-activating enzyme 17 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 β-HSD) 1 and the estrogen-inactivating 17 β-HSD 2. A ligand-based 17 β-HSD 2 pharmacophore model was applied to screen a cosmetic chemicals database, followed by in vitro testing of selected paraben compounds for inhibition of 17 β-HSD 1 and 17 β-HSD 2 activities. All tested parabens and paraben-like compounds, except their common metabolite p-hydroxybenzoic acid, inhibited 17 β-HSD 2. <b>Ethylparaben</b> and ethyl vanillate inhibited 17 β-HSD 2 with IC 50 values of 4. 6 ± 0. 8 and 1. 3 ± 0. 3 µM, respectively. Additionally, parabens size-dependently inhibited 17 β-HSD 1, whereby hexyl- and heptylparaben were most active with IC 50 values of 2. 6 ± 0. 6 and 1. 8 ± 0. 3 µM. Low micromolar concentrations of hexyl- and heptylparaben decreased 17 β-HSD 1 activity, and <b>ethylparaben</b> and ethyl vanillate decreased 17 β-HSD 2 activity.

40|$|Poster Session 236 - Biodegradation of Heterocyclics & Aromatic Compounds (Division Q) : {{abstract}} no. 2779 BACKGROUND: Pharmaceuticals {{and personal}} care products (PPCPs) have been worldwide distributed, and attracted increasing attention over the past decades. During wastewater treatment, biodegradation under aerobic conditions plays important role in removal of hazard substances, including PPCPs. Most of previous studies focused on the detection method establishment and occurrence of PPCPs. Some combined methods of biodegradation and other removal processes, have been conducted {{over a wide range}} of compound categories. However, so far no researches have been conducted to reveal the PPCPs biodegradation in the activated sludge system. Thus, this study aims to investigate biodegradation processes of selected PPCPs under aerobic conditions in the activated sludge process. METHODS: Removal of twelve PPCPs (acyclovir, ranitidine, fluconazole, carbamazepine, fluoxetine, mefenamic acid, benzylparaben, <b>ethylparaben,</b> methylparaben, propylparaben, benzophenone- 1 and benzophenone- 3) in activated sludge process was investigated using the batch reactors. Solid phase extraction and ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were used to determine the concentrations of the PPCPs. RESULTS: At environmental relevant concentrations, fluconazole and carbamazepine showed no evident reduction by biodegradation, adsorption, volatilization and hydrolysis in activated sludge process for 48 hr, while 99 % of benzylparaben, <b>ethylparaben,</b> fluoxetine, methylparaben, and propylparaben were removed by biodegradation and adsorption within 1 hr under the same condition. Activated sludge process removed 99 % of acyclovir, benzophenone- 1, benzophenone- 3, and metronidazole within 15 hr, while mefenaic acid and ranidine were mainly reduced within 24 hr and 48 hr, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Most PPCPs can be effectively removed by bacteria in acticvated sludge within 48 hr. However, bacteria failed to metabolize fluconazole and carbamazepine under aerobic conditions. Future work should focus on the mechanisms for those PPCPs which are biodegradable.

From an allergological perspective, parabens constitute weak sensitizers. As a matter of fact, contact allergy incidence to these substances has always been low, and today reaches negligible levels, given their banning from most cosmetic products. Contact allergy highest percentages used to be associated to topical parabens containing drugs which were applied on lesional skin (wounds, ulcers, preexisting contact dermatitis).

All these analytes were separated in a single run using 60 mM tetraborate buffer solution (TBS) pH = 9. 2 as a BackGround Electrolyte (BGE) by using an uncoated fused silica capillary of I. D. = 50 m m and applying a voltage of 25 kV {{in the first part of}} the electropheretic run (up to 5. 8 min) and 30 kV for the remaining time. The hydrodynamic pressurization of the inlet vial was 20 psi at 7. 2 min. up to the end of analysis. Total separation time was of 7. 5 min. The method was then successfully validated and applied to the simultaneous determination of active ingredients and preservatives. Good repeatability, linearity, and sensitivity were demonstrated. Precision of migration time (t m) was RSD% c) was RSD% 2 1. 000. LOD and LOQ, accuracy (recovery) and ruggedness were evaluated for each analyte demonstrating the good reliability of the method.

40|$|A new multi-residue {{method for}} the {{determination}} of 25 acidic/neutral pharmaceuticals (antibiotics, anti-inflammatory/analgesics, lipid regulating agents, diuretics, triazides, H 2 -receptor antagonists, cardiac glicozides and angiotensin II antagonists) and personal care products (sunscreen agents and preservatives) in surface water with the usage of a new technique: ultra performance liquid chromatography–negative electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) was developed and validated. The novel UPLC system with 1. 7 μm particle-packed column allowed for good resolution of analytes with the application of low mobile phase flow rates (0. 05 mL min− 1) and short retention times (from 4. 7 min to 13. 3 min) delivering a fast and cost-effective multi-residue method. SPE with the usage of Oasis MCX strong cation-exchange mixed-mode polymeric sorbent was chosen for sample clean-up and concentration. The influence of mobile-phase composition, matrix assisted ion suppression and SPE recovery on {{the sensitivity of the}} method was identified and quantified. The instrumental limits of quantification varied from 0. 2 μg L− 1 to 30 μg L− 1. The method limits of quantification were at low nanogram per litre levels and ranged from 0. 3 ng L− 1 to 30 ng L− 1. The instrumental and method intra-day and inter-day repeatabilities were on average less than 5 %. The method was successfully applied for {{the determination of}} PPCPs in River Taff. Thirteen compounds were determined in river water at levels ranging from a single to a few hundred nanograms per litre. Among them were ten pharmaceuticals (aspirin, salicylic acid, ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, mefenamic acid, furosemide, sulfasalazine and valsartan) and three personal care products (methyl- and <b>ethylparaben</b> and 4 -benzophenon...|$|E
40|$|The alkyl esters of {{p-hydroxybenzoic}} acid (PHBA) known as parabens (Pbens) {{are widely used}} as preservatives in food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. Several in vivo and in vitro studies have shown these compounds to be estrogenic. Here, for the first time, we present evidence of their estrogenicity using a morphometric analysis of uteri from mice treated with the preservatives methylparaben (MePben), <b>ethylparaben</b> (EtPben), propylparaben (PrPben), and butylparaben (BuPben) compared with estradiol (E 2). Different groups of adult ovariectomized (Ovx) CD 1 mice were subcutaneously (sc) treated daily for three days with two different equimolar doses (362 and 1086 mmol/kg) of the Pbens: MePben (55 and 165 mg/kg), EtPben (60 and 180 mg/kg), PrPben (65 and 195 mg/kg), BuPben (70 and 210 mg/kg), E 2 (10 mg/kg; 0. 036 mmol/kg), and vehicle (propyleneglycol; V, 10 mL/kg). On the fourth day, uteri were dissected, blotted, weighed, {{and placed in a}} fixative solution for 24 h. The paraffin embeded uteri were cut to obtain 7 mm thick transversal sections. Luminal epithelium heights (LEH), glandular epithelium heights (GEH), and myometrium widths (MW) were measured. The highest Pbens dose was able to produce uterotrophic effects (38 to 76 %) compared to E 2 efects (100 %). The relative uterotrophic potency to E 2 (100) was from 0. 02 to 0. 009. Significant increases (PB/ 0. 05) in LEH, GEH, and MW as compared with V were obtained: LEH from 87 to 113 % (E 2 153 %), GEH from 10 to 40 % (E 2 60 %), and MW from 35 to 43 % (E 2 88 %). These results confirm that Pbens at the doses assayed here induce estrogenic histological changes in the uteri of Ovx mice. Toxicology and Industrial Healt...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of five esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (parabens) were measured using HPLC-MS/MS at four serial locations across the human breast from axilla to sternum using human breast tissue collected from 40 mastectomies for primary {{breast cancer in}} England between 2005 and 2008. One or more paraben esters were quantifiable in 158 / 160 (99 %) of the tissue samples and in 96 / 160 (60 %) all five esters were measured. Variation was notable with respect to individual paraben esters, location within one breast and similar locations in different breasts. Overall median values in nanograms per gram tissue for the 160 tissue samples were highest for n-propylparaben [16. 8 (range 0 – 2052. 7) ] and methylparaben [16. 6 (range 0 – 5102. 9) ]; levels were lower for n-butylparaben [5. 8 (range 0 – 95. 4) ], <b>ethylparaben</b> [3. 4 (range 0 – 499. 7) ] and isobutylparaben 2. 1 (range 0 – 802. 9). The overall median value for total paraben was 85. 5 [*]ng[*]g− 1 tissue (range 0 – 5134. 5). The source of the paraben cannot be identified, but paraben was measured in the 7 / 40 patients who reported never having used underarm cosmetics in their lifetime. No correlations were found between paraben concentrations and age of patient (37 – 91 [*]years), length of breast feeding (0 – 23 [*]months), tumour location or tumour oestrogen receptor content. In view of the disproportionate incidence of breast cancer in the upper outer quadrant, paraben concentrations were compared across the four regions of the breast: n-propylparaben was found at significantly higher levels in the axilla than mid (P[*]=[*] 0. 004 Wilcoxon matched pairs) or medial (P[*]=[*] 0. 021 Wilcoxon matched pairs) regions (P[*]=[*] 0. 010 Friedman ANOVA) ...|$|E
40|$|The alkyl esters of {{p-hydroxybenzoic}} acid known as parabens (Pbens) {{are used as}} preservatives in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations. They have been reported as estrogenic. Here, we present evidence for the in vivo and in vitro bioactivities and receptor binding affinities of methylparaben (MePben), <b>ethylparaben</b> (EtPben), propylparaben (PrPben), and butylparaben (BuPben) {{compared with those of}} estradiol (E 2). Estrogenicity was studied using the uterotrophic assay in immature (Im) and adult ovariectomized (Ovx) CD 1 mice, and in immature female Wistar rats (IW). Animals were subcutaneously (sc) treated for three consecutive days with different molar equivalent doses ranging from 3. 62 to 1086 mmol/kg body weight of Pbens, E 2 (0. 036 mmol/kg), or vehicle. Pbens increased uterine weight in Im and Ovx animals and their relative uterotrophic effect to E 2 (100) (RUEE 2) were from 34 to 91. The relative uterotrophic potencies related to E 2 (100) (RUPE 2) of these compounds were from 0. 003 to 0. 007. The E 2 ED 50 for CD 1 animals able to increase the uterine weight was 7 mg/kg (0. 9 / 55 confidence limits); and that of Pbens ranged from 18 to 74 mg/kg. In IW rats, the ED 50 were from 33 to 338 mg/kg. All Pbens, except MePb, competed with [3 H]E 2 for the estrogen receptor binding sites. The uterotrophic effects of Pbens in Im mice have a positive correlation with the side-chain length of the ester group of these compounds. The E 2 and Pbens relative binding affinities (RBA) and Ki values correlated to their estrogenic activity. The NOELs values for Pbens uterotrophic activity in Im were from 0. 6 to 6. 5 mg/kg per day; and Ovx from 6 to 55 mg/kg. The NOELs IW ranged from 16. 5 to 70 mg/kg indicating that Im were more susceptible than Ovx and IW to these effects. The data shown here confirm the estrogenicity o...|$|E
