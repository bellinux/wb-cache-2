Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 59). Banking sector in Bangladesh is underdeveloped but recent expansion of private banks has created an opportunity to grow in this highly competitive market. From the begging the banks were more traditional is service and was ideologically challenged in product innovation. Some of the multinational banks operating in Bangladesh created a vast opportunities for modern banking. Moreover, export business operation {{of the country is}} fully dependent on banking services. It is the one and only method of foreign transaction and currency conversion. The growing success of Textile sector {{has proved to be a}} worth full indicator for the banks to expand and increase the profitability. Almost every bank provides foreign exchange facilities. Thus this internship report is prepared by focusing on the <b>export</b> <b>operation</b> and short- term financing of Jamuna Bank Limited. The only focus of this report was to observe the export procedure and financing related with <b>export</b> <b>operation.</b> The internship started by describing the history of banks in Bangladesh and JBL’s short introductory background. Then the report continued by describing different product and services offered by the bank. The internship was designed to provide the real life job experience and the later part was fully focused on the job description. The project of the report has been prepared to understand the overall <b>export</b> <b>operation</b> and financing (export bill purchase) of the bank. However, a critical analysis has also been done to show the performance of the bank comparing with other banks and also with its own branches. Finally, the report has conducted some recommendations for the bank as a suggestive tool for future improvement which might be helpful to expand and introduce new banking services to the customers.

40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} key firm- and industry-specific {{restrictions}} {{to the performance}} of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in services trade. For this purpose, we use firm-level data from firms in France operating in different services sectors over the time period 1998 to 2007 and formulate two-part models consisting of (i) (dy namic) export equations and (ii) (dynamic) export share equations. Our results confirm the view that a relatively low share of SMEs engage in services trade. In line with the new-new trade theory, our results also corroborate that more productive SMEs have a higher export probability. The key finding of this paper is that the export decisions of SMEs in services sectors are estimated to be extremely persistent, implying that trade pol icy efforts, including the allocation of scarce trade promotion budgets, should be directed at addressing the barriers faced in establishing the first <b>export</b> <b>operation.</b> Finally, our sub-sectoral estimates reveal considerable heterogeneity across different types of services...|$|E

The analysis measures NPV mean and standard deviation for a range of exchange rate volatilities and evaluates their effect on these statistics. The research further considers what effect this has on the real option value of deferring the decision to invest. In considering practical mitigation of this currency risk a further analysis is done in which a simple hedging strategy is used.

40|$|Although a {{loosely coupled}} component-based {{framework}} offers flexibility and versatility for building and deploying large-scale multi-physics simulation systems, {{the performance of}} such a system can suffer from excessive buffering of data objects {{which may or may}} not be transferred between components. By taking advantages of the collective properties of parallel simulation components, which is common for data-parallel scientific applications, an optimization method, which we call buddy-help, can greatly enhance overall performance. Buddy-Help can reduce the time taken for buffering operations in an exporting component, when there are timing differences across processes in the exporting component. The optimization enables skipping unnecessary buffering operations, once another process, which has already performed the collective <b>export</b> <b>operation,</b> has determined that the buffered data will never be needed. Because an analytical study would be very difficult due to the complexity of the overall coupled simulation system, the performance improvement enabled by buddy-help is investigated via a micro-benchmark specifically designed to illustrate the behavior of coupled simulation scenarios under which buddy-help can provide performance gains. ...|$|E

The study will need to take into consideration some changes regarding the requirement of a simple exchange, with two products, which are necessary for the comprehension of this trade process.
