5|$|Previously {{the police}} used a {{decentralized}} <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> <b>system</b> {{developed during the}} mid-1990s. As late as 2012 servers were still being run with Windows NT 4.0 from 1996 and log-on times were typically twenty minutes. The new IT-system D#2 was introduced in 2011 and will have been taken into use by all divisions by 2012. D#2 will be operated by ErgoGroup and will have two redundant server centers. Personnel {{have access to the}} system via thin clients. The police have a system to raise a national alarm to close border crossings and call in reserve personnel. The one time it was activated the message was not received by any of the intended recipients. Since 2009 it has been possible to report criminal damage and theft of wallets, bicycles and mobile telephones without a known perpetrator(s) online.|$|E

50|$|Even though <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> <b>systems</b> allow {{businesses}} {{to be conducted}} at a faster pace, that quicker pace {{is not without its}} flaws. <b>Information</b> <b>technology</b> <b>systems</b> are extremely vulnerable to security breaches.
