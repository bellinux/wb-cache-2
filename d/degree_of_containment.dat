30|$|Coupled thermal and poromechanical {{processes}} play {{an important}} role in a number of problems of interest in geomechanics such as stability of boreholes and hydraulic fracturing in geothermal reservoirs or high temperature petroleum-bearing formations. This is due to that fact that when rocks are heated/cooled, the bulk solid as well as the pore fluid tends to undergo expansion/contraction. A volumetric expansion can result in significant pressurization of the pore fluid depending on the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> and the thermal and hydraulic properties of the fluid as well as the solid. The net effect is a coupling of thermal and poromechanical processes. A few analytical procedures have been developed and used to solve geomechanics problems of interest involving coupled thermal and poromechanical problems (Delaney 1982; Wang and Papamichos 1994; Li et al. 1998; Ghassemi and Diek 2002; Ghassemi and Zhang 2004).

In this paper we adopt a multidimensional model that supports partial containment and extend this model in order to support the change <b>of</b> the <b>degree</b> (percentage) <b>of</b> <b>containment,</b> because this <b>degree</b> can change over time.

Borderline pathology combined {{with high levels of}} comorbidity, stigma, and treatment uncertainty, increase the challenges of caring for someone with this diagnosis in an emergency setting.

The maintenance of safety requires prioritisation and necessitates a practical and respectful approach, which avoids notions of attention-seeking behaviour. Clinical assessment should distinguish between self-harm and suicide attempts where possible and take into account acute on chronic risk. The emergency clinician will need to consider the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> required in the emergency department and is encouraged to maintain transparency and honesty with the client regarding treatment decisions.

However, the authors {{are not aware of}} any published evidence or international guidance on the level of pressure differential required for BL- 3 laboratories. This uncertainty was reflected in a survey of BL- 3 laboratories in the United Kingdom where a range of pressure differentials between 30 and 100 Pascals (Pa) were found. In this paper, an attempt is made to address this issue. The authors have developed techniques to quantify the effectiveness of containment laboratories in preventing the egress of airborne microorganisms. A potassium iodide (KI) aerosol tracer method was adapted to measure the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> in an experimental facility and in five working BL- 3 laboratories. The level of laboratory containment was expressed as the laboratory protection factor (LPF). Using this technique, it was found that providing an anteroom increased the LPF by approximately one order of magnitude. No direct relationship was found between the magnitude of negative pressure and LPF. There was, however, a direct relationship between inflow velocity and LPF: A volumetric inflow of 10 m 3 /min into a laboratory through an anteroom gave a LPF of greater than 10 5.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of worker exposure to radioactive materials during accidents at nuclear facilities {{is a principal}} concern of the DOE. The KBERT analysis tool has been developed at Sandia National Laboratories under DOE support {{to address this issue}} by assisting in the estimation of risks posed by accidents at chemical and nuclear facilities. KBERT is an acronym for Knowledge-Based system for Estimating hazards of Radioactive material release Transients. KBERT's primary purpose is to predict doses to in-facility workers due to accidental releases of radioactivity. Models are also in KBERT for predicting doses to the public based upon plume dispersal models. This report gives detailed instructions on how a user, starting with knowledge of design, layout and potential hazards of a facility, can use KBERT to assess the risks to workers in that facility and to the public as a result of releases from the facility. A key feature of KBERT is the inclusion of the non-facility-specific material release, radioactive decay, and dose databases (i. e., knowledge bases) that might also be needed for such an assessment. The material release characteristics are based on the 1994 DOE Handbook for airborne release fractions/rates and respirable fractions for nonreactor nuclear facilities. Another important feature of KBERTis the inclusion of a transparent interface between KBERTand the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's CONTAIN code. This interface enables KBERT to use the validated and proven flow models in CONTAIN to predict inter-room airflows. Potential applications of KBERT include the evaluation of the consequences of evacuation practices, the effect of personal protection equipment, and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> of hazardous materials...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} challenges facing chemical engineers today is developing more efficient processes that reduce the discharge of greenhouse gasses (GHG) and the usage of material and energy resources. Furthermore, industrial manufacturers are making major efforts to incorporate inherently safer design concepts when developing or retrofitting processes. With the recent discoveries of shale gas, there is a growing interest in monetization pathways that convert gas to chemicals and fuels. The Fisher-Tropsch gas-to-Liquid (GTL) process is regarded as a promising alternative to producing liquid transportation fuels. A typical GTL plant requires substantial mass, energy, and financial resources. The syngas production section, in particular, accounts for approximately 50 - 75 % of the total capital costs and about 60 - 70 % of the total energy requirements. Also, the GTL plants have several trains for the syngas production section to accommodate large-scale capacities. Focus on this work is to investigate possible improvements to the GTL process in two areas: 1) tailgas recycling and 2) lower steam-to-carbon (S/C) ratio for autothermal reforming (ATR). The results from these cases are analyzed in terms of cost, inherent safety, and environmental sustainability. Ultimately, the aim of this research is to support the decision makers in understanding the multi-objective insights and in using these insights to make better decisions in design and operation. This study provides a comparative approach for four different operating cases from various perspectives: economics, inherent safety, and environmental sustainability. In the inherent safety analysis, a fire and explosion hazard analysis are used to choose the least hazardous material for a fuel. The release rate is estimated at the failure case in order to evaluate the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> loss. For the environmental sustainability, the carbon efficiency of the overall process and CO 2 emissions are evaluated. The operating conditions and results are validated against pilot test results from industry in order to verify the degree of carbon deposition during operation. The results are used to establish tradeoffs among the various objectives...|$|E
40|$|Bifurcating {{developmental}} branching morphogenesis {{gives rise}} to complex organs such as the lung and the ureteric tree of the kidney. However, a few quantitative methods or tools exist to compare and distinguish, at a structural level, the critical features of these important biological systems. Here we develop novel graph alignment techniques to quantify the structural differences of rooted bifurcating trees and demonstrate their application {{in the analysis of}} developing kidneys from in normal and mutant mice. We have developed two graph based metrics: graph discordance, which measures how well the graphs representing the branching structures of distinct trees graphs can be aligned or overlayed; and graph inclusion, which measures the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> of a tree graph within another. To demonstrate the application of these approaches we first benchmark the discordance metric on a data set of 32 normal and 28 Tgf beta(+/-) mutant mouse ureteric trees. We find that the discordance metric better distinguishes control and mutant mouse kidneys than alternative metrics based on graph size and fingerprints - the distribution of tip depths. Using this metric we then show that the structure of the mutant trees follows the same pattern as the normal kidneys, but undergo a major delay in elaboration at later stages. Analysis of both controls and mutants using the inclusion metric gives strong support to the hypothesis that ureteric tree growth is stereotypic. Additionally, we present a new generalised multi-tree alignment algorithm that minimises the sum of pairwise graph discordance and which can be used to generate maximum consensus trees that represent the archetype for fixed developmental stages. These tools represent an advance in the analysis and quantification of branching patterns and will be invaluable in gaining {{a deeper understanding of the}} mechanisms that drive development.

40|$|RNA {{molecules}} {{will tend}} to adopt a folded conformation through the pairing of bases on a single strand; the resulting so-called secondary structure {{is critical to the}} function of many types of RNA. The secondary structure of a particular substring of functional RNA may depend on its surrounding sequence. Yet, some RNAs such as microRNAs retain their specific structures during biogenesis, which involves extraction of the substructure from a larger structural context, while other functional RNAs may be composed of a fusion of independent substructures. Such observations raise the question of whether particular functional RNA substructures may be selected for invariance of secondary structure to their surrounding nucleotide context. We define the property <b>of</b> self <b>containment</b> to be the tendency for an RNA sequence to robustly adopt the same optimal secondary structure regardless of whether it exists in isolation or is a substring of a longer sequence of arbitrary nucleotide content. We measured <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> self <b>containment</b> using a scoring method we call the self-containment index and found that miRNA stem loops exhibit high self containment, consistent with the requirement for structural invariance imposed by the miRNA biogenesis pathway, while most other structured RNAs do not.

40|$|Individual {{sandstone}} beds {{containing a}} co-genetic mud-clast-rich (MCR) division are being increasingly described from the distal reaches of many deep-water fan systems. These deposits, termed hybrid event beds, {{are considered to}} record a flow whose composition and rheology changed significantly to become increasingly more argillaceous (clay-rich), MCR and turbulence-suppressed during the deposition of a single event bed. Studies of confined systems, in which gravity flows were affected by confining sea-floor topography, have documented similar deposits recording turbulence suppression in proximity to confining sea-floor topography (e. g., basin margins). In new research from a confined, contained system from the Castagnola Basin of NW Italy, lateral transects of individual sandstone beds 5 km in extent show that individual sandstone beds contain a co-genetic MCR division which is often; 1) extensive across the basin rather than localised adjacent to confining topography; 2) exhibits rapid, significant and repeated variation in depositional character over short length scales (tens to hundreds of metres), specifically {{in terms of the}} thickness of co-genetic MCR divisions and the size and abundance of clasts contained within them; and 3) exhibits variation in depositional character over larger length scales (> 1 km) which is non-systematic in relation to palaeoflow direction or increasing proximity towards the counter slope of the downstream confining northern basin margin. A suite of factors within the Castagnola Basin is thought to have resulted in the deposition of these co-genetic MCR divisions whose thickness and distribution are less predictable in relation to confining sea-floor topography than those described from other confined uncontained settings. Specific factors include; 1) recent and voluminous entrainment of muddy substrate at seemingly random locations across the basin floor and their support and transport within a high sediment concentration gravity flow; and 2) containment (ponding) of gravity flows within a confined basin, which is thought to have established extensive and complex three dimensional flow dynamics across the basin following flow interaction with multiple basin margins. This research highlights the role of entrainment of muddy substrate and subsequent transport processes of muddy substrate for developing co-genetic MCR divisions, as well as the importance of understanding the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> depositional systems experienced when considering the spatial distribution of depositional facies, and thus reservoir quality, in topographically complex settings...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To develop {{approaches}} to the evaluation of programmes whose strategic objectives are to halt or slow weed spread. Location: Australia. Methods: Key aspects in the evaluation <b>of</b> weed <b>containment</b> programmes are considered. These include the relevance of models that predict the effects of management intervention on spread, the detection of spread, evidence for containment failure and metrics for absolute or partial containment. Case studies documenting either near-absolute (Orobanche ramosa L., branched broomrape) or partial (Parthenium hysterophorus (L.) King and Robinson, parthenium) containment are presented. Results: While useful for informing containment strategies, predictive models cannot be employed in containment programme evaluation owing to the highly stochastic nature of realized weed spread. The quality of observations {{is critical to the}} timely detection of weed spread. Effectiveness of surveillance and monitoring activities will be improved by utilizing information on habitat suitability and identification of sites from which spread could most compromise <b>containment.</b> Proof <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> failure may be difficult to obtain. The default option of assuming that a new detection represents containment failure could lead to an underestimate <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> success, the magnitude of which will depend on how often this assumption is made. Main conclusions: Evaluation <b>of</b> weed <b>containment</b> programmes will be relatively straightforward if containment is either absolute or near-absolute and may be based on total containment area and direct measures <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> failure, for example, levels of dispersal, establishment and reproduction beyond (but proximal to) the containment line.

40|$|The {{engineering}} {{profession has}} been called upon by the public {{in recent years to}} provide ever increasing <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> for low level waste contained in shallow subsurface waste containment facilities. To provide this protection, the use of engineered liners or barriers has become a common design feature. In many cases, these barriers are constructed out of natural clays or artificial mixtures of clay minerals. The use of soil barriers to contain waste products consisting of strong electrolyte solutions, has met with mixed success. Clays of lowest permeability are also those whose behavior is the most influenced by the presence of salt solutions. Failures of clay liners exposed to electrolyte solutions have not been well documented. The mechanism for failure seems {{to be the result of}} shrinkage of the clay, which then leads to the development of a secondary structure of cracks and fissures. Field cases of liner failure have often been described as occurring as a result of "osmotic desiccation". The general objective of this study was to define, and quantify, the mechanisms controlling the rate and magnitude of volume change in clay soils exposed to strong electrolyte solutions. A review of the literature presented two possible mechanisms termed osmotically consolidation. Osmotically induced consolidation occurs as a result of for osmotic volume change. induced consolidation and These were osmotic rapid flow of water out of the sample in response to osmotic gradients. Osmotic consolidation occurs as as result of a reduction in the net electrostatic repulsive stresses between clay particles. A general theoretical description of osmotically induced consolidation and osmotic consolidation was developed. A phenomenological approach was adopted to describe fluid flow in response to osmotic gradients. A Darcy type flow law was used to related osmotic flows to osmotic gradients through a conductivity term called the osmotic permeability. To describe osmotic consolidation, the osmotic pressure of the pore fluid was selected as a stress state variable. Volume changes were linked to the osmotic pressure of the pore fluid through a constitutive relationship. The soil property used to define changes in soil volume due to osmotic pressure changes was called the osmotic compressibility. A numerical solution to the theoretical description of osmotic flow and volume change was developed using finite element techniques. This model was used to characterize the processes of osmotic and osmotically induced consolidation. A laboratory program was undertaken to monitor the osmotic flow and volume change in two clays; Regina Clay and an Ottawa SandI Na montmorillonite mixture. From the results of these tests the dominant mechanism of volume change for these clays was found to be osmotic consolldatipn. The test procedures developed allowed the soil properties describing osmotic flow and volume change to be evaluated. A technique was developed by which the electrostatic repulsive stresses within a clay could be measured indirectly through laboratory testing. The results indicated that the onset of fracturing may be predicted by comparing the change in the net repulsive stress that occurs as result of changing pore fluid concentrations, to the confining stress within the soil...|$|R

The system model contains {{a description of the}} node, network, processing in respective sub-models.

The report contributes with a taxonomy by which failures can be described. The resulting failure model is affected by the model of the system and by the model of how processing is done in the system. The class of system is assumed to be strongly partitioned which provides a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> error <b>containment</b> for real-time processes executed in the same node and also for processes executed on different nodes. The smallest unit of failure is therefore the process. The system model uses a broadcast communication network similar to Flexray, i. e. it supports both time-triggered and event-triggered communication. The class of system is chosen based on the requirements of safety-critical applications such as x-by-wire. The processing model for the system is presented in which operation is divided into sequentially executed primitive operations, called CDR-operations (Compute and Distribute Result operations). A CDR-operation involves a producer process which computes a result and distributes the result via broadcast communication to consumer processes.

40|$|This {{case study}} {{presents}} psychotherapeutic work with „JD‟, an African male in his mid-twenties {{with a history}} of sexual abuse and early deficiencies in maternal provision. The focus of the study is on the difficulty of attempting to comprehend and provide <b>containment</b> (the operationalization <b>of</b> <b>containment),</b> as a trainee therapist working with this particular patient. „JD‟ presented with a number of interpersonal fears, complaints of isolation, an unbearable sense of confusion and uncertainty as well repressed anger and resentment. This clinical combination of difficulties, when mixed in with the author‟s own challenges as a trainee therapist, made therapeutic work challenging. The therapist employed a broadly defined psychodynamic framework, with a particular emphasis on „containing‟ „JD‟s unbearable levels of distress and anxiety whilst attempting to aid in the process of ascribing meaning to his confusing and difficult experiences. This undertaking was a challenging task, given that the concept <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> is not necessarily clear-cut (particularly for a trainee therapist) and in addition, that the patient seemingly lacked a sense <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> whilst growing up. The case study aims to illustrate and explore the challenges of operationalizing and providing the function <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> in psychotherapy with due consideration to the contributions of both the therapist‟s and patient‟s dynamics. In assessing the difficulties involved in attempting to provide containment in this therapy, it becomes apparent that for a beginner therapist the provision <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> is easily complicated by his/her narcissistic anxieties and countertransference reactions. It is proposed that aspects <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> as elaborated by more contemporary theorists may be possible to provide as a trainee therapist, but that working with projective identification as understood by a more classic Bion informed notion <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> is more difficult to master.
