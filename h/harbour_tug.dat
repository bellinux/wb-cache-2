The bridge was closed in 1983 to motor vehicles and is slowly deteriorating, especially after it sustained damage when a ship accidentally rammed it some years ago.

25|$|By {{the first}} half of the 1st century AD, {{steering}} gear mounted on the stern were also quite common in Roman river and harbour craft as proved from reliefs and archaeological finds (Zwammderdam, Woerden 7). A tomb plaque of Hadrianic age shows a <b>harbour</b> <b>tug</b> boat in Ostia with a long stern-mounted oar for better leverage. Interestingly, the boat already featured a spritsail, adding to the mobility of the harbour vessel. Further attested Roman uses of stern-mounted steering oars includes barges under tow, transport ships for wine casks, and diverse other ship types. Also, the well-known Zwammerdam find, a large river barge at the mouth of the Rhine, featured a large steering gear mounted on the stern. According to new research, the advanced Nemi ships, the palace barges of emperor Caligula (37-41 AD), may have featured 14 m long rudders.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the dangers}} posed by British naval forces, the Kriegsmarine made {{another attempt to}} supply the {{invasion}} by sea. On 24 May, Oberleutnant-zur-See Österlin, who had led the Maleme Flotilla, was given the task of transporting two Panzer II light tanks over to Kastelli Kisamou. Österlin commandeered a small wooden lighter at Piraeus and arranged for the tanks to be lowered onto it. At dusk the next day, the lighter, towed by the small <b>harbour</b> <b>tug</b> Kentauros, left Piraeus and headed south towards Crete. Reports of British naval units operating nearby convinced Admiral Schuster to delay the operation and he ordered Österlin to make for a small harbour on the German-occupied island of Kithira. At a meeting in Athens on 27 May, Luftwaffe Generals Richthofen, Jeschonnek and Löhr pressed Schuster to get the tanks delivered somehow before [...] "...the Englander claws himself erect again". One of Richthofen's liaison officers had returned from the island on 26 May; the paratroopers were in poor condition, lacking in discipline and [...] "at loose ends". He stressed the [...] "absolute and immediate need" [...] for [...] "reinforcement by sea shipment of heavy weaponry if the operation is to get ahead at all." ...|$|E

He sailed close to the cliff of the Great Isabel, throwing a penetrating glance from the deck {{at the mouth of the}} ravine, tangled in an undisturbed growth of bushes. He sailed close enough to exchange hails with the workmen, shading their eyes on the edge of the sheer drop of the cliff overhung by the jib-head of a powerful crane. He perceived that none of them had any occasion even to approach the ravine where the silver lay hidden; let alone to enter it. In the harbour he learned that no one slept on the island.

40|$|The {{shipping}} {{industry is}} reliant on port authorities for the facilitation of safe entry and {{departure of ships}} at the ports. This role can not be fulfilled without the assistance of <b>harbour</b> <b>tugs</b> which are run by the marine operations section of the Transnet National Ports Authority. The tugs have {{to be safe and}} efficient in the process of pulling and pushing ships around the <b>harbour.</b> <b>Harbour</b> <b>tugs</b> are expensive to acquire and to maintain. The marine operations business has to make appropriate choices of tug propulsion design in order to realise the benefits of the tugs acquired by the ports authority. This can be achieved by analysing the current tugs that the operations are using, which will then serve as valuable information when the time for asset replacement is due. The researcher chose to use the two tug propulsion designs currently used by the Port Elizabeth <b>harbour</b> <b>tugs</b> as a basis for this analysis. The analysis links the three factors of maintenance management, equipment efficiency and equipment safety, to the minimisation of operational costs as perceived by the tug personnel, the pilots and the marine managers. This study seeks to verify the link between these factors and the perceived minimisation of operational costs. Available literature was reviewed and data was collected using a suitably designed questionnaire for this research. This research paper has led to recommendations that should inform the tug acquisition decisions and raise the awareness of the marine employees to relate the factors set out above to minimise operational cost...|$|R
