5000|$|... (f) The impulse timer is a D type {{positive}} {{edge triggered}} flip flop. Input information applied at D {{is transferred to}} Q on the occurrence of the positive edge of the clock pulse. thus when the comparator output (e) is positive Q goes positive or remains positive at the next positive clock edge. Similarly, when (e) is negative Q goes negative at the next positive clock edge. Q controls the electronic switch to generate the current impulse into the integrator. Examination of the waveform (e) during the initial period illustrated, when Vin is 0.4 V, shows (e) crossing the threshold well before the trigger edge (positive edge of the clock pulse) {{so that there is}} an appreciable delay before the impulse starts. After the start of the impulse there is further delay while (e) climbs back past the threshold. During this time the comparator output remains high but goes low before the next trigger edge. At that next trigger edge the impulse timer goes low to follow the comparator. Thus the clock determines the duration of the impulse. For the next impulse the threshold is crossed immediately before the trigger edge and so the comparator is only briefly positive. Vin (a) goes to full scale, +Vref, shortly {{before the end of the}} next impulse. For the remainder of that impulse the capacitor current (c) goes to zero and hence the integrator slope briefly goes to zero. Following this impulse the full scale positive current is flowing (c) and the integrator sinks at its maximum rate and so crosses the threshold well before the next trigger edge. At that edge the impulse starts and the Vin current is now matched by the reference current so that the net capacitor current (c) is zero. Then the integration now has zero slope and remains at the negative value it had at the start of the impulse. This has the effect that the <b>impulse</b> <b>current</b> remains switched on because Q is stuck positive because the comparator is stuck positive at every trigger edge. This is consistent with contiguous, butting impulses which is required at full scale input.|$|E

40|$|Magnetoforming {{technology}} {{often requires}} <b>impulse</b> <b>current</b> amplitudes {{of several hundred}} kiloamps, at pulse durations between 30 Âµs and > 100 Âµs. Often, it is required to provide the impulse via a flexible transmission line (cable) {{in order to allow}} the forming coil to be positioned correctly. These cables have to withstand the high pulse currents without deterioration for a large number of pulses. In addition, it is necessary to minimise the inductance of the cable connection, as an increase in inductance negatively influences the efficiency of the installation as a whole, whence low-inductance coaxial cables are required which are able to fulfil all of these requirements simultaneously. Manufacturers normally do not specify the <b>impulse</b> <b>current</b> capability of coaxial cables, as this is not necessary for most standard applications.

The performance of most earth electrode geometries is now fairly well understood under these conditions.

In this thesis, both modelling and experimental studies were carried out using high frequency and <b>impulse</b> <b>current</b> injection. Generic earth electrodes as well as the full earthing grid of an operating substation were investigated. The studies carried out in this work have confirmed some of the previous findings published in the open literature, and have clarified some aspects of conduction in earthing systems. The literature review on injuries due to lightning currents has highlighted the importance of good earthing systems. A comprehensive parametric simulation study was conducted on vertical rods, horizontal electrodes as well as earth grids under variable frequency and impulse currents. The effects of geometry and soil characteristics were also studied. It was demonstrated that significant inductive effects appear at high frequency, {{and the size of the}} earthing systems was found to reach an 'effective dimension' beyond which negligible performance benefit is obtained. For horizontal electrodes the concept of effective length is investigated and for grids the effective area was used instead. The Simulation techniques developed for these simple electrodes were applied to an operating transmission substation, and similar trends were seen under high frequency and <b>impulse</b> <b>current</b> conditions. The safety voltages were calculated but no conclusion could be drawn as there are no recommended safety guidelines for safety at high frequency and <b>impulse</b> <b>current.</b> These Generic studies have led to a new proposal for earthing systems so that the short fall of poor performance due to inductive effects and 'effective dimensions' are minimized.
