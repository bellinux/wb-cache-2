2500|$|Gough {{planned to}} attack on 13 November, with five {{divisions}} from II and V Corps astride the Ancre river, which flowed between Thiepval and Beaumont Hamel. Gough intended {{to reduce the}} head of the German salient between Thiepval and Serre, the main effort coming from V Corps with the 63rd, 51st, 2nd and 3rd divisions, against positions north of the Ancre, which had not been seriously attacked since 1 July. It was hoped that the intervening nineteen weeks of trench warfare, had substantially reduced German fighting power. Three objective lines were set, the first running from Beaucourt Station (opposite St Pierre Divion)–up Beaumont Hamel valley–eastern outskirts of Beaumont Hamel–Redan Ridge–west of Serre, requiring an advance of [...] over three German trench lines and four trench lines in places. The second line was [...] further <b>forward,</b> <b>running</b> west of Beaucourt–east slope of Redan Ridge–east of Serre–west to the boundary of V and XIII Corps, which would be advanced towards Star Wood. The final objective (third line) was set at Beaucourt–the Puisieux road valley–second line.

60|$|The Loons--for {{so these}} folks were called--had been doing many things, some playing together, some working at tasks and some {{gathered}} in groups to talk; {{but at the}} sound of strange voices, which echoed rather loudly through the clearing, all turned {{in the direction of the}} intruders.

60|$|Æneas pressed {{steadily}} on, {{though in}} a state continually of the highest excitement and apprehension. He kept stealthily along wherever he could find the deepest shadows, under walls, and through the most obscure and the narrowest streets. He was in constant fear lest some stray dart or arrow should strike Anchises or Creusa, or lest some band of Greeks should come suddenly upon them, in which case he knew well that {{they would all be}} cut down without mercy, for, loaded down as he was with his burden, he would be entirely unable to do any thing to defend either himself or them. The party, however, for a time seemed to escape all these dangers, but at length, just as they were approaching the gate of the city, and began to think that they were safe, they were suddenly alarmed by a loud uproar, and by a rush of men which came in toward them from some streets in that quarter of the city, and threatened to overwhelm them. Anchises was greatly alarmed. He saw the gleaming weapons of the Greeks who were rushing toward them, and he called out to Æneas to fly faster, or to turn off some other way, in order to escape the impending danger. Æneas was terrified by the shouts and uproar which he heard, and his mind was for a moment confused by the bewildering influences of the scene. He however hurried <b>forward,</b> <b>running</b> this way and that, wherever there seemed the best prospect of escape, and often embarrassed and retarded in his flight by the crowds of people who were moving confusedly in all directions. At length, however, he succeeded in finding egress from the city. He pressed on, without stopping to look behind him till he reached the appointed place of rendezvous on the hill, and then gently laying down his burden, he looked around for Creusa. She was nowhere to be seen.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of the McDavid Knee Brace on <b>forward</b> and backward <b>running</b> kinematics and ground reaction forces. The subjects were 10 past history of knee problems or any other physical disabilities that could affect their performance. The subjects were unpaid volunteers. Stride length and stride frequency values were determined during forward and backward treadmill run under each experimental condition (with a brace and without a brace). An ANOVA indicated no significant knee brace effect for either forward or backward treadmill running stride length or stride frequency. In the second phase of this study, ground reaction forces were determined for each experimental condition. The ground reaction peak forces under each experimental condition were not significantly different during either <b>forward</b> or backward <b>running.</b> Other statistical analysis of other dependent variables of <b>forward</b> and backward <b>running</b> indicated no significant bracing effect for ankle, knee and hip angular acceleration, angular displacement and angular velocity. Within the limitation of this study it is concluded that the McDavid Knee Brace had no effect on <b>forward</b> or backward <b>running</b> kinematics or ground reaction forces.

50|$|After {{attempting}} the hit, the fencer {{continues to}} move <b>forward,</b> <b>running</b> past {{his or her}} opponent, to avoid the riposte {{if he or she}} was parried, or a counterattack. If the fencer moves past as quickly as possible the opponent generally only has one chance to hit the fleching fencer as he/she passes. Rules prevent body contact with the opponent in foil. Infraction of the rule may result in a warning, awarding a touch to the opponent, and/or expulsion from the competition. In épée, contact merely results in a stopping of play without penalty, unless it was done with jostling, brutality, or to avoid being hit.|$|E
