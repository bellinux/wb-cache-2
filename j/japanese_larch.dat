40|$|Open-pollinated {{hybridisation}} {{seed orchards}} of European and <b>Japanese</b> <b>larches</b> produce mixed progenies combining a highly variable proportion of hybrids along with pure parental species. For several reasons, {{it is desirable}} to identify and to sort out hybrids from pure species at the seedling stage. Taxa identification of 1 – 2 yr-old seedlings was attempted using non-destructive assessment of several traits, including morphology, phenology, growth and architecture parameters. Two sets of progenies originating from 10 open-pollinated hybridisation seed orchards were used, relying in a first step on taxa identification of individual seedlings with diagnostic molecular markers. Based on 21 traits assessed, some clear trends in pure species and hybrid features were apparent but due to the large and overlapping ranges of taxa characteristics, no single parameter allowed unambiguous identification of taxa. Combination of traits through linear discriminant analysis made possible correct classification of 90. 2 % to 98. 6 % of individuals depending on the orchard although {{there were a few}} problematic orchards. Two traits appeared particularly pertinent for discriminating young plants taxa, namely 1 st-yr leaf retention (marcescence) and the bark colour of 2 nd-year shoot increments.

40|$|Yield of bulk {{collected}} provenances of Larix sukaczewii {{was compared}} to first generation Russian larch hybrids and three other tree species native to Scandinavia. The hybrids were full sib families of selected European and Russian larch (L. decidua x L. sukaczewii) or <b>Japanese</b> and Russian <b>larch</b> (L. kaempferii x L. sukaczewii). Two provenances of L. sukaczewii were compared.

We characterized two-AP 2 domain genes named LmAP 2 L 1 and LmAP 2 L 2. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that LmAP 2 L 1 and LmAP 2 L 2 were orthologous to Norway spruce PaAP 2 L 1 and PaAP 2 L 2 and that L 1 forms seemed to be specific to Pinaceae. RT-PCR analysis showed that larch APETALA 2 were differentially expressed during late somatic embryogenesis and first steps of germination. Whereas LmAP 2 L 2 was constitutively expressed during this process, LmAP 2 L 1 expression only appeared during late somatic embryogenesis when embryos were able to germinate. Furthermore, LmAP 2 L 1 {{seemed to be the}} preferential expressed form during embryo germination.

40|$|Growth model forlarch in {{pure and}} even-aged stands. Adistance {{independent}} tree growth {{model has been}} determined forpure and even-aged larch stands (Larix sp.) growing in Walloon Region (South Belgium). This model has been built from 2578 <b>larches</b> (<b>Japanese,</b> European and Hybrid larches) in 99 stands. It enables to predict tree circumference increment from circumference, dominant height, basal area, age and site index of stands. Estimating increments of 1283 larches in 48 stands {{has been used to}} validate the model that gives unbiased estimates of the increments (mean error = - 0. 002 cm with standard deviation of 0. 60 cm). The mean absolute error of estimates is 0. 46 cm. year - 1. The model has also been tested to predict the increment of larches in French experimental plots having very different silvicultural treatments. The residues of these estimations depend on the stand basal area: the lesser the stand basal area, the higher the residues of the estimation. A correction factor, linked to basal area through a Bailey and Clutter curve, has been introduced to extend the validity of the model to stands with a basal area lower than 12 m 2. ha - 1. This factor does not affect the increment estimations if the stand characteristics are close to mean value of the sample used to build the model (correction factor close to 1). The introduction in the model of competition indexes distance dependant or site qualitative variables does not significantly improve the growth model...|$|R
40|$|Open pollinated seed from {{selected}} {{trees were}} jointly collected by IBL and INRA in native stands of Larix decidua ‘polonica’ in Swietokrzyskie Mont. in 1987. From this collection {{a network of}} progeny trials was set up. Altogeth er 157 progenies were collected and shared among France, Poland and Belgium. Eight progeny trials (4 in France, 2 in Poland and 2 in Belgium) were established in the nineties. The aim of the experiment was to investigate genetic variability at the stand and progeny levels and the behaviour of the half sib families in various environmental conditions. Network aim was also to study the possibilities of long-distance seed transfer in ecologically contrasting environments. The growth and architecture of trees (stem form and branch angle) were recorded ten years after planting in the field. Polish sites were better in growth than the Western European sites. In contrast, stem form was on average slightly worse in Polish conditions compared to French and Belgian sites. In France, polonica larch suffered on some sites from several defects connected to growth (drought cracks), sensitivity to wind storm and to Meria laricina. Compared to sudetan larch and hybrid larch controls from seed orchards, polonica larch looked in Belgium on average less good for both growth and stem form. In France, polish larch competed well with other European larch origins (sudetan, alpine) or species (<b>Japanese</b> and hybrid <b>larch)</b> except {{with some of the}} best commercial varieties of hybrid larch.

40|$|Future {{climate changes}} {{may lead to}} an {{interest}} of alternative and foreign forest tree species in order to spread the risks in forestry. Douglas fir, Sitka spruce, Freemont cottonwood and hybrid aspen are examples of popular foreign tree species that along with western red cedar could have a future in the Swedish forests. Södra Skogsägarna and SLU have collaboration in establishment of foreign species in Swedish forests. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze and present the establishment of western red cedar, and to survey and illustrate injuries of freeze drying and other damages like deer browsing, vegetation and insect attacks. The study included four different provenances, and spruce as a reference, planted in two locations – Asa and Släne. Western red cedar is despite its name a conifer of the cupressaceae family with defined secondary characteristic and gets along well with an overstory. Western red cedar grows often in mixed stands with similar conifers and its natural habitat is within and in the area near to British Columbia. The study included two series of field inventories, one made in the summer and one in the autumn 2013, three growing seasons after plantation. Every second row in the western red cedar plantations were planted with hybrid larch, a cross between <b>Japanese</b> and European <b>larch,</b> to improve a favorable climate for the main trees which are sensitive to freeze, and also to spread the economic risks. The results showed that the reference spruce had a greater establishment than the western red cedar but the results also proves western red cedar to be a possible alternative tree species in these two locations. The study showed good growth even though western red cedar was affected by injuries from freeze and pine weevil. Of the four provenances there was one that had a lower survivorship than the others, Yola Creek, which was more coastal than the other reported provenances. Den här studien har jämfört etableringen av jättetuja med fyra olika provenienser och en referensgran på två olika lokaler samt studerat skador av frosttorka och övriga skador. Södra Skogsägarna och SLU har ett samarbete kring främmande trädslag med syftet att studera etableringsförsök. Jättetuja, Thuja plicata, ofta benämnt som western red cedar, är ett barrträdslag inom familjen cupressaceae och växer ofta i blandbestånd tillsammans med andra liknande barrträdslag.
