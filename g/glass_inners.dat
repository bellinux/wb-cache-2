40|$|Cloud-to-ground {{lightning}} strikes produce natural {{glasses on the}} surface of the Earth, called fulgurites. These natural glasses are tubular in shape with a central void surrounded by an <b>inner</b> <b>glass,</b> and the <b>inner</b> <b>glass</b> is surrounded by an outer crust or toasted region. Previous studies report different kinds of melts existing in several different types of fulgurites; however, little to no chemical data has been collected that tracks chemical variations from the <b>inner</b> <b>glass</b> to the outer crust of a fulgurite. This study uses microprobe and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer analytical techniques to collect transects of chemical composition from the <b>inner</b> <b>glass</b> to the outer crust of eleven fulgurites. Five of the eleven fulgurite samples show a well-mixed, volatile-depleted <b>inner</b> <b>glass,</b> enclosed in a poorly mixed volatile enriched outer melt, suggesting that these fulgurites formed from the vaporization and condensation of materials on the inner fulgurite wall. The remaining six fulgurites show poorly mixed melts in both the <b>inner</b> <b>glass</b> and outer crust regions, and most likely originated as lightning-produced melting phenomena. These data suggest that certain enigmatic natural glasses, such as Edeowie, Dakhleh and other unknown desert glasses, may be lightning-produced, in contrast to the meteorite burst or impact related origins that have commonly been propounded...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of different pore fluids present in unsaturated soils (water and air) complicates {{the measurement of}} sample volume change. Since volume change of the air phase is difficult due to the compressibility of the fluid, it becomes necessary to measure sample volume change by measuring the change in volume {{of water in the}} surrounding triaxial cell. This paper introduces and assesses a new double cell triaxial cell developed by Wykeham Farrance. The design of the new triaxial system is similar to the Wheeler modified triaxial cell (Wheeler, 1988) but uses a <b>glass</b> <b>inner</b> cell wall, to avoid problems of absorption of water by Perspex. Furthermore, the cell has been designed to use a high capacity suction probe that can be fitted through the base pedestal.

30|$|The {{difference}} of temperature between <b>glass</b> <b>inner</b> surface and water {{has a significant}} impact on distillate productivity. Wind flow can increase that temperature difference, which can eventually increase the yield. According to El-Sebaii (2000), daily productivity increases with increase in wind flow up to a certain wind speed but has no significant affect after that speed and the effect of wind is more at summer and at higher water masses. For his experimented stills, that optimum speed was found to be 10 and 8 m/s on typical summer and winter days, respectively. Soliman (1972) has also researched on the effect of wind on solar distillation. He found that at lower ambient temperature increasing wind speed increases the temperature difference between water and glass cover of the still. This will eventually increase radiation, conduction and convection losses at higher rate than the increase in rate of evaporation. The scenario is opposite at higher temperature. Therefore, the still can be placed at a place where it will receive high wind at summer and low wind at winter.|$|R

Up to 405 W of output power was achieved without the need for active water or forced air cooling. The slope efficiency of this source was 74 % and maximum outer heat sink temperature was ~ 140 °C. This arrangement allowed for significant weight and size savings to be achieved with the active fibre laser head weighing less than 100 g. We will discuss the design choices and trade-offs of metal coated active fibre on high power fibre laser systems as well as the prospects for further power scaling to the kW level...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to study}} {{the possibility of the}} application, to analyze the thermal performance, and to figuring the energy performance of naturally ventilated double-skin fa??ade in the hot and humid climate region with Indonesia???s climate as a case study. Ventilated double-skin fa??ade can be defined as a fa??ade construction, which comprises of the outer glass, the shading device, and the <b>inner</b> <b>glass.</b> The outer <b>glass</b> and the <b>inner</b> <b>glass</b> form a cavity air space as a channel for the air flow to pass from the lower air inlet to the upper air outlet. The research runs firstly by numerical simulation to predict the solar heat gain and the thermal performance of the cases. The cases were based on the combination of the thickness of the glass skin and the distance between the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>glasses,</b> including the orientation of double-skin fa??ade. The result of the numerical simulation hereafter was used to calculate the U-value and the Shading Coefficient (SC) of the double-skin fa??ades. After determining the U-value and the SC of double-skin fa??ade, the next step of the research was to calculate the heat load of the double-skin fa??ade model building using MicroHASP/TES. The heat load resulted from the calculation tool was used to designing the air-conditioning system of the double-skin fa??ade building model and then simulated it using LCEM Tool afterward to evaluate the energy performance of the building model. The results of the numerical calculation show that the naturally ventilated double-skin fa??ade was effective to minimize the solar heat gain and the thermal transmittance. Proper combination of the thickness of the outer and the <b>inner</b> <b>glasses</b> can significantly reduce the solar heat gain as well as the proper arrangement of the distance between the outer and the <b>inner</b> <b>glasses</b> can reduce the thermal transmittance. In comparison to the single-skin fa??ade, naturally ventilated double-skin fa??ade was perform better in reducing heat load with no condensation occurred {{on the surface of the}} <b>inner</b> <b>glass</b> during building operation time from 08 : 00 - 17 : 00, even at rainy season. Moreover, reflectance, absorptance, and transmittance of solar radiation in double-skin fa??ade are varying based on the angle incidence of solar radiation. When the angle incidence is lower than 70 ??, the percentage of transmittance, reflectance and absorptance of the solar radiation is low and relatively constant. The percentage of reflected solar radiation will increase rapidly and the percentage of absorbed and transmitted solar radiation will decrease when the solar incidence angle is higher than 70 ??. Furthermore, the simulation on the energy performance of ventilated double-skin fa??ade showed the advantages in reducing primary energy consumption. The annual total energy consumption of the double-skin fa??ade window system was 12 % lower than other window systems (8 mm single-glass and 6 mm pair glass window types). Moreover, the system COP for both 8 mm glass single-skin fa??ade and 6 mm pair glass was 3. 21, and double-skin fa??ade window system is 3. 32. The system COP can be improved by installing double-skin fa??ade obviously. Consequently, the ventilated double-skin fa??ade is efficient and useful in reducing energy consumption in buildings in the hot and humid climate area...|$|R

40|$|A novel Taylor-Couette {{system has}} been {{constructed}} for investigations of transitional as well as high Reynolds number turbulent flows in very large aspect ratios. The flexibility of the setup enables studies {{of a variety of}} problems regarding hydrodynamic instabilities and turbulence in rotating flows. The inner and outer cylinders and the top and bottom endplates can be rotated independently with rotation rates of up to 30 Hz, thereby covering five orders of magnitude in Reynolds numbers (Re = 101 – 106). The radius ratio can be easily changed, the highest realized one is η = 0. 98 corresponding to an aspect ratio of 260 gap width in the vertical and 300 in the azimuthal direction. For η < 0. 98 the aspect ratio can be dynamically changed during measurements and complete transparency in the radial direction over the full length of the cylinders is provided by the usage of a precision <b>glass</b> <b>inner</b> cylinder. The temperatures of both cylinders are controlled independently. Overall this apparatus combines an unmatched variety in geometry, rotation rates, and temperatures,which is provided by a sophisticated high-precision bearing system. Possible applications are accurate studies of the onset of turbulence and spatio-temporal intermittent flow patterns in very large domains, transport processes of turbulence at high Re, the stability of Keplerian flows for different boundary conditions, and studies of baroclinic instabilities...|$|R
40|$|The current primary {{standards}} at NPL for {{the measurement of}} absorbed dose to water in high energy photon and electron beams are graphite calorimeters. However, the quantity of interest in radiation dosimetry is absorbed dose to water. Therefore, a new absorbed dose to water standard based on water calorimetry has been developed for use in high energy photon and electron beams. The calorimeter operates at 4 deg C, with temperature control being provided by liquid cooling. The sealed <b>glass</b> <b>inner</b> vessel of the calorimeter was designed to minimise the effect of non-water materials on the measurement of absorbed dose. The temperature sensing thermistor probes were designed and constructed so that glass is the only material in contact with high purity water inside the vessel. Initial measurements of absorbed dose to water made in 6, 10, and 19 MV photons, and 16 MeV electrons agreed, within the measurement uncertainties of approximately 1. 5 % (95 % c. l.), with those determined by graphite calorimetry. These measurements confirmed the feasibility of the calorimeter design. Significant improvements {{have been made to}} the temperature measurement system, the water phantom and its temperature controlled enclosure since these measurements were performed, reducing the estimated uncertainty on the measurement of absorbed dose to water to 1 % (95 % c.
