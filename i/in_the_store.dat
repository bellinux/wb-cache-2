5|$|Walsh was on {{the team}} that {{captured}} criminal Arthur Barker, son of gangster Ma Barker, in Chicago in 1935 and was later involved in tracking Public Enemy Number One Al Brady in 1937. On October 12 of that year, {{he was with the}} group of FBI agents who ambushed and killed Brady in a shoot-out at a Bangor, Maine sporting goods store. While waiting for Brady to arrive, he acted as a clerk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> for several days and arrested Brady Gang member James Dalhover. As the operation leader, Walsh's job was to alert thirteen other agents, as well as over 30 other state and local policemen, of any gang member's arrival by pulling a cord on the window. As they were interrogating Dalhover <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> Clarence Lee Shaffer, Jr., another gang member, entered the building and began firing at the agents. While arresting Dalhover, Walsh took bullets to his hand, shoulder and right chest, but quickly returned to work.|$|E

5|$|It is {{speculated that}} cowrie shells {{may have been}} the {{principal}} currency at Gedi. Cowrie shells have been recovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> rooms of the houses and found in greater abundance than struck coins, represented by only two coins of Chinese origin. The use of cowries as currency is supported by their historical use as tender in various parts of Africa, and Kirkman estimated the exchange rate of cowrie shells to the gold dinar to be 400,000 to 1. However, there are examples of locally struck coins at contemporary sites, but none have been recovered at Gedi. The use of beads as a currency has also been proposed by J. F. Schofield, who claims that a {{decline in the number of}} beads recovered in the upper stratigraphic layers reflects a decline in their value around the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Marcus {{continued}} {{throughout his}} tenure to hold tightly to his father's assurance {{that he would}} be able to maintain and act on his political convictions while running the business. He supported the United Nations in its early years, an unpopular position in Dallas for that time. In the early 1950s he began to explore the ramifications of ending the store's participation in the then-common practice of excluding black customers from shopping <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> and while his legal advisors cautioned against that step, he offered support for any black entrepreneur looking to establish a quality store and, in 1954, began to hire black staff in some departments.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the other}} boys ran {{across the street to}} tell Curtis Jones what {{happened}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>store.</b> When the older man with whom Jones was playing checkers heard the story, he urged the boys to leave quickly, fearing violence. Bryant told others of the events at the store, and the story spread quickly. Jones and Till declined to tell his great-uncle Mose Wright, fearing they would get in trouble. Till said he wanted to return home to Chicago. Carolyn's husband Roy Bryant was on an extended trip hauling shrimp to Texas and did not return home until August 27.|$|E

Air {{curtains}} {{are commonly}} used to cut off air flow between <b>the</b> cold <b>store</b> and hot environment, and reduce heat and mass transfer {{in order to maintain}} <b>the</b> low temperature <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold <b>store.</b> CFD can be used to predict operation rule of air curtain used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold <b>store</b> intuitively and modelling is {{the most important part of}} numerical simulation of air curtain used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold <b>store.</b> <b>In</b> this study, different numerical models including standard εκ − model (with and without boussinesq approximation) and RSM (with and without boussinesq approximation) were used to simulate the temperature field and air flow field <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold <b>store</b> and operation rule of air curtain used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold <b>store</b> after air curtain opened for 60 s. Meanwhile, the actual operation of air curtain used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold <b>store</b> was tested and the simulation values were compared with the experimental values. The results showed that the velocity of the central mainstream decayed slowly, but the velocity of both sides of air curtain decayed fast. The optimal model used to predict the temperature field and air flow field <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold <b>store</b> and operation rule of air curtain used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold <b>store</b> was standard εκ − model with boussinesq approximation, the relative error was within 20 %.

5|$|Till {{arrived in}} Money, Mississippi, on August 21, 1955.

The {{teenagers}} were children of sharecroppers and had been picking cotton all day. The market mostly served the local sharecropper population and was owned by a white couple, 24-year-old Roy Bryant and his 21-year-old wife Carolyn. Carolyn was alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> that day; her sister-in-law was {{in the rear of}} the store watching children.

5|$|Although much {{is known}} of Little's {{investment}} activities in his adult life, {{little is known about}} his early years. Jacob Little was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts on March 17, 1794. The son of a successful local shipbuilder and of Quaker origin, Little exhibited a strong understanding of money and financial markets from an early age. In 1817 he emigrated to New York City and became a clerk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> of Jacob Barker, a highly successful financier, merchant, and politically well-connected founding member of the Democratic Party political machine Tammany Hall. Little spent five years in apprenticeship under Barker before moving out in 1822 to start his own business with $700 he had accrued over the length of his employment. He bought a small office {{in the basement of a}} Wall Street building, which served as his base of operations for the next twelve years, before moving out of his old office to a new one in the basement of the old exchange building in 1834, from which he opened a brokerage—the start of his investment career.|$|E

5|$|Logan and Mac {{continue}} to make progress on his business school report, but Mac has to call Max (Adam Rose) to continue. Desmond goes skinny dipping at his party, while Mac and Max flirt in front of Logan. Veronica discovers that Desmond’s bag was actually switched with another person’s. Veronica and Piz retrieve it, and on the car ride home, they briefly discuss their kiss at the party before playing a CD with some of Desmond’s unreleased newer material. Keith reconnects with Leo D’Amato (Max Greenfield), who presents a case involving the Fitzpatricks to him. They stake out where the Fitzpatricks are, and Keith sees Vinnie Van Lowe helping them. However, they quickly learn that Vinnie is actually investigating the case and has trapped them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>store.</b> Veronica and Piz supposedly get stuck in traffic and tell Desmond to play some of his newer songs until they get there, but they actually are at the concert venue and just want him to expose the audience to his solo material.|$|E
5|$|The Gurdon Bill Store {{is named}} for Gurdon Bill, {{who was born in}} 1784. The land was {{originally}} purchased by Bill and his partner, Philip Gray, in 1818. Clouette notes that four years later, Bill was the sole owner of the property; a record from 1819 says Gray sold his interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> to Bill for $500. Bill continued to run the store until shortly before his death in 1856. At age 21, Bill went to Plainfield Academy and later went on to work with various merchants before setting up the store in North Groton, later incorporated as Ledyard, Connecticut. Clouette notes a brief passage of the store out of the Bill family, soon reacquired, before it was sold to the Congregational Society in 1875. The Congregational Society has made limited use of the store, preserving its historical integrity. Local historians speculate that the store's final transaction was made in 1868; afterwards the store was boarded up and left essentially unused.|$|E
