25|$|It is also <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> very {{wall that}} Cal built to {{effectively}} imprison {{the population of}} Mega City One helped in the city's defence {{on a number of}} occasions, including attacks from Sabbat's zombies. However its most prominent role was when the wall's weaponry functioned as an anti-missile defence system against Sov-block missiles during the Apocalypse War.|$|E
25|$|De la Gardie {{had been}} partly {{responsible}} for the treaty with France and had worked hard to increase the young King Charles's power. It might seem <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> treaty helped moving Sweden into a deep crisis financially, which, together with the level of power Charles had attained, in turn led to the reduction. Thus, De la Gardie contributions came to be a large factor behind his own fall from power and richness.|$|E
25|$|Cavalry {{were rarely}} {{used by the}} Assyrians or many other Mesopotamians until the 9th century BC, when their use is {{mentioned}} {{during the reign of}} Tukulti-Ninurta II. Before then, many nomads or steppe warriors relied on cavalry, who raided Assyrian lands. The Assyrians had to counter this mobile form of warfare and so beat their opponents, notably the Iranians, at their own game. Perhaps the greatest outside influence is that of the Iranian Medes. It is <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> raiding by that people assisted Assyrian attempts in building a cavalry army with which to destroy the Kingdom of Elam. However, Assyrian attempts were not without difficulties; horse archers were used but could not use their bows and the reins of their horses at the same time. As a result, cavalry under Ashurnasirpal are depicted in pairs, with one rider holding both reins and the other shooting with a bow. The Assyrians experienced fewer problems with cavalry when they were deployed as lancers; under Tiglath Pileser III, the Assyrian Cavalry continued to be paired of but this time each warrior held his own lance and controlled his own horse. By the 7th century BC, mounted Assyrian warriors were well armed with a bow and a lance, and armored with lamellar armour, while their mounts were equipped with fabric armour, providing limited yet useful protection in close combat and against missiles. Cavalry were to form the core of the later Assyrian armies.|$|E
5000|$|... "Born to Run" [...] named [...] "The {{unofficial}} youth anthem of New Jersey" [...] by the New Jersey state legislature; something Springsteen {{always found}} to be <b>ironic,</b> considering <b>that</b> <b>the</b> song [...] "is about leaving New Jersey" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic review noted [...] "With a {{reputation}} as one of the originators of cool jazz, it's <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> over <b>the</b> years tenor saxophonist Warne Marsh gained a following of musicians mainly associated with the avant-garde, spearheaded by multi-reedist Anthony Braxton. These musicians heard what this disc demonstrates: that cool didn't always mean smoothed out".|$|R
50|$|Overall, however, it {{was entirely}} {{necessary}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> B1s be introduced, because the LNER was operating {{a large number of}} engines that were well past their economic life. It was somewhat <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> among <b>the</b> engines <b>that</b> came under threat {{with the arrival of the}} B1s were <b>the</b> ones <b>that</b> Thompson admired <b>the</b> most: the engines of the North Eastern Railway designed by Vincent Raven (his father-in-law).|$|R
500|$|Another {{approach}} to critique {{taken in the}} classroom has been to propose the insignificance of female characters in the story as sexist. While Bilbo {{may be seen as}} a literary symbol of small folk of any gender, a gender-conscious approach can help students establish notions of a [...] "socially symbolic text" [...] where meaning is generated by tendentious readings of a given work. By this interpretation, it is <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first authorized adaptation was a stage production in a girls' school.|$|E
500|$|... "Everybody" [...] was commercially {{released}} as Madonna's first single in October 6, 1982, and {{came with a}} Lou Beach-designed sleeve depicting a hip hop–style NYC street scene. Because of the ambiguous nature of the record sleeve and the R groove of the song, Madonna was widely {{believed to be a}} black artist when the single was released. According to Matthew Lindsay of The Quietus, it was <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> record sleeve did not depict Madonna on the cover, as she would become [...] "the face of the 80s." ...|$|E
500|$|McGovern {{supported}} {{economic stimulus}} efforts during the late-2000s recession, including the Economic Stimulus Act in February 2008 and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (which established the Troubled Asset Relief Program) in October 2008. He supported the Obama administration's 2009 stimulus package. Responding to Republican criticism of Democratic budgetary priorities, he chided the GOP for {{running up the}} national debt under George W. Bush, saying: [...] "It is somewhat <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> very people who drove this economy into a ditch are now complaining {{about the size of}} the tow truck." [...] He voted to instate the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act in February 2010.|$|E
50|$|In 1941 Berrangé {{was charged}} with special duties by Brigadier General Collyer, Military Secretary to General Smuts. These duties {{included}} seeking out fascists who might be infiltrating the armed forces. It is <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> after <b>the</b> Second World War Berrangé would find himself increasingly involved in defending {{the human rights of}} those prosecuted by the Nationalist Government some of whose members had been supporters of the Nazis.|$|R
50|$|It's <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> Loria and <b>the</b> Marlins {{held their}} celebration in Miami on Remembrance Day Canadian {{equivalent}} of Veterans Day because there's {{a generation of}} fans north of <b>the</b> border <b>that</b> will never forget how Loria's actions led to the Expos leaving town.|$|R
5000|$|Dick Enberg, the play-by-play {{announcer}} of {{the broadcast}} on NBC, noted: [...] "And wasn't it <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> Denver got <b>the</b> ball back on the two-yard line? Wasn't it just one year ago where the Broncos were on their own two before putting together what became 'The Drive'?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Lastly, {{he found}} it <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Court had relied on the {{plurality}} standard in O'Connor, since its discussion would make it even harder to assess what the operating realities of the workplace were. [...] "Any rule that requires evaluating whether a given gadget is a 'necessary instrumen for self-expression, even self-identification,' on top of assessing {{the degree to which}} 'the law's treatment of [...] evolve,' ... is (to put it mildly) [...] unlikely to yield objective answers." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, the Swans {{came under}} {{enormous}} public scrutiny, even from AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou, for their unorthodox, [...] "boring" [...] defense-oriented tactics that included tightly controlling the tempo {{of the game}} and starving the opposition of possession (in fact, seven teams that season had their lowest possession total whilst playing against the Swans). Swans coach Paul Roos maintained that playing contested football was the style used by all recent Premiership-winning teams, and felt that it was <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> much criticised strategy proved ultimately successful.|$|E
2500|$|It is now <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Eels have {{themselves}} {{been discovered}} to have breached the Salary Cap by cheating the system since 2013. On 3 May 2016 they were fined $1,000,000, stripped of the 2016 Auckland Nines title and docked all competition points earned thus far. The club {{will be able}} to earn competition points going forward assuming they can correct their player payments to salary cap requirements. [...] As of 11 September 2017, Parramatta has never defeated Melbourne in a finals game having lost all five encounters in The 1999 preliminary final, 2006 qualifying final, 2007 preliminary final, The 2009 NRL Grand Final and The 2017 qualifying final.|$|E
50|$|Other size-dependent {{property}} changes include {{quantum confinement}} in semiconductor particles, surface plasmon resonance in some metal particles and superparamagnetism in magnetic materials. What would appear <b>ironic</b> is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> changes in physical properties {{are not always}} desirable. Ferromagnetic materials smaller than 10 nm can switch their magnetisation direction using room temperature thermal energy, thus making them unsuitable for memory storage.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Getler, a Public Broadcasting Service ombudsman, criticized <b>the</b> decision; writing <b>that</b> [...] "it {{would have}} been a greater bow to freedom of {{expression}} and against guilt by association for the program and PBS to stick by her ... it struck me as <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> at <b>the</b> very time PBS is fighting against new Federal Communications Commission rulings about indecency <b>that</b> <b>the</b> network argues will inhibit documentary filmmakers and freedom of speech, it delivers a subjective punishment to a popular performer for something done seven years ago that was clearly a spoof".|$|R
5000|$|Elisabeth Flynn (Sharon Small, series 8) {{joined the}} team {{after she was}} {{promoted}} following an on-the-job injury. Her personal crusade was against knife-crime, making it <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was <b>the</b> first case <b>that</b> fell onto her desk. She sees Ronnie as a dinosaur, and has a deep desire to modernise the police force. She appears only in the final episode of the series.|$|R
2500|$|Clinton {{condemned}} on 12 July {{both the}} attacks and the incumbent government, stating that al-Assad had [...] "lost legitimacy", and that [...] "President Assad is not indispensable {{and we have}} absolutely nothing invested in him remaining in power." [...] Robert Stephen Ford, the US ambassador to Syria, criticised the government on the embassy's Facebook page, stating: [...] "On July 9, a 'mnhebak' group threw rocks at our embassy, causing some damage. They resorted to violence, unlike the people in Hama, who have stayed peaceful... and how <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Syrian Government lets an anti-US demonstration proceed freely while their security thugs beat down olive branch-carrying peaceful protesters elsewhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harry Blackmun wrote a dissent {{signed by}} Brennan and Marshall. He {{argued that the}} {{majority}} had read Wilko too narrowly and understated {{the significance of the}} 1975 reforms. While allowing that arbitration was not as problematic as it had been, he still felt there were valid concerns. [...] "It is thus <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Court's decision, no doubt animated by its desire to rid the federal courts of these suits, actually may increase litigation about arbitration." [...] John Paul Stevens added one of his own expressing surprise that the Court would so casually overturn what had been settled law in all the circuits for the past three decades.|$|E
2500|$|Another, similar {{controversy}} arose when Wolkoff {{decided to}} use [...] "5 Pointz" [...] as the name for the new condominiums being constructed on 5 Pointz's site. He had claimed to own {{the rights to the}} building's name because he owned the building; however, an application to trademark the name was rejected in March 2014 because it was too close to a similar, existing trademark. Wolkoff has said that the name refers to the building site, not the art; his comment had insulted some artists at the site, with two artists saying that [...] "it's <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> same corporation which single-handedly destroyed all the artwork known as 5Pointz is trying to capitalize on its name" [...] and that [...] "the disrespect continues".|$|E
5|$|Mother Jones {{magazine}} additionally commented {{upon the}} key theme of satire over {{conflict between the}} critical success of Star Trek and the decision to cancel the program by the studio executives. <b>The</b> magazine noted <b>that</b> writer Michael O'Donoghue's work for the sketch was among the highest caliber scripts he had written for Saturday Night Live. Mother Jones found it <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> sketch the Enterprise was defeated not by its traditional enemies such as the Klingons, but by a stupid NBC executive {{in charge of the}} network's programming schedule.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{the wildest}} {{of them all}} {{and he was the}} strongest so it’s <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> we all ended up sober and he fought his demons. Bobby Gillespie and me ended up sober, Andrew Innes is {{practically}} sober and even Tim Abbot is sober but unfortunately the strongest one didn’t end up sober and it’s <b>ironic</b> and heartbreaking <b>that</b> <b>the</b> strongest one physically died at 49.He was a truly beautiful, gentle person. I guess it’s that old cliche of live fast die young… ...|$|R
5000|$|Using a web camera, Hu {{participated in}} a European {{parliamentary}} hearing in Brussels in November 2007 about human rights in China. At the hearing he said: “It is <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> one of <b>the</b> people in charge of organizing the Olympic Games {{is the head of}} the Bureau of Public Security, which is responsible for so many human rights violations. It is very serious <b>that</b> <b>the</b> official promises are not being kept before the games.” ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the last}} section of his dissent Blackmun found some {{prospect}} for relief. Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, then chair of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, had had similar concerns {{and was surprised to}} hear the SEC take the opposite position in its amicus brief from what its representatives had consistently told his subcommittee. He advised lower courts to [...] "take seriously their duty to review the results of arbitration to the extent possible under the Arbitration Act." [...] In fact, he concluded, he foresaw more investors bringing such complaints to their attention. [...] "It is thus <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Court's decision, no doubt animated by its desire to rid the federal courts of these suits, actually may increase litigation about arbitration." ...|$|E
2500|$|The same year, Rollins {{recorded}} another landmark {{piece for}} saxophone, bass and drums trio: Freedom Suite. His original sleeve notes said, [...] "How <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Negro, who {{more than any}} other people can claim America's culture as his own, is being persecuted and repressed; that the Negro, who has exemplified the humanities in his very existence, is being rewarded with inhumanity." [...] The title track is a nineteen-minute improvised bluesy suite; {{the other side of the}} album features hard bop workouts of popular show tunes. Oscar Pettiford and Max Roach provided bass and drums, respectively. The LP was available only briefly in its original form, before the record company repackaged it as Shadow Waltz, the title of another piece on the record.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{aircraft}} produced {{under this}} system was the S.E.1, ostensibly a refurbishment of a Blériot XII. This {{was destroyed in}} a crash before flight testing was complete, killing Ridge. In the hands of Geoffrey de Havilland the Voisin which had been donated to the Army Air Battalion by the Duke of Westminster was reborn as the B.E. 1, a neat biplane with an excellent performance which first took to the air in December 1911, and this was followed rapidly {{by a series of}} similar aircraft, ostensibly improvements of the motley collection of aircraft in the Factory's possession, which in some cases did not even retain the original engine. [...] It is <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first visible fruits of a programme intended to bring order to chaos were the result of a subversion of the system.|$|E
5000|$|This {{game was}} {{published}} in Swedish by Äventyrsspel under the name Empire. This created <b>the</b> <b>ironic</b> situation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game was named [...] "Imperium" [...] in English ("Imperium" [...] is the Swedish word for [...] "Empire") and [...] "Empire" [...] in Swedish ("Empire" [...] not a Swedish word). The name change came about because Äventyrspel was concerned about possible confusion with their Star Wars licensed role-playing products released {{at the same time}} as this game.|$|R
5000|$|The {{imposing}} crib {{structure was}} a first on the Great Lakes. The pier was reconstructed in 1870—a massive undertaking that was hampered by <b>the</b> <b>ironic</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> viable 'building season' is far shorter than even the normal operating season for the light—and used a [...] "bird cage" [...] lantern, which makes it {{one of only three}} built on the Great Lakes. The lantern originally held the first fourth order Fresnel lens on the Great Lakes.|$|R
50|$|This last salvo {{of abuse}} brings Petruchio {{back from the}} dead: he sits up in his coffin, {{prompting}} in Maria a state of final bafflement if not total respect. <b>The</b> two pledge <b>that</b> they will start life anew together amidst the richly comic and <b>ironic</b> mood <b>that</b> ends <b>the</b> play.|$|R
2500|$|Literal and metaphorical {{references}} to eyesight appear throughout Oedipus Rex. Clear vision {{serves as a}} metaphor for insight and knowledge, but the clear-eyed Oedipus is blind to the truth about his origins and inadvertent crimes. The prophet Tiresias, on the other hand, although literally blind, [...] "sees" [...] the truth and relays what is revealed to him. [...] "Though Oedipus' future is predicted by the gods, even after being warned by Tiresias, he cannot see the truth or reality beforehand because his excessive pride has blinded his vision…" [...] Only after Oedipus has physically blinded himself does he gain a limited prophetic ability, as seen in Oedipus at Colonus. It is deliberately <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> [...] "seer" [...] can [...] "see" [...] better than Oedipus, despite being blind. In one line (Oedipus the king, 469), Tiresias says: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1952, Hurston {{supported}} {{the presidential campaign}} of Senator Robert A. Taft. Like Taft, Hurston was against Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policies. She also shared his opposition to Roosevelt and Truman's interventionist foreign policy. In the original draft of her autobiography, Dust Tracks on a Road, Hurston compared the United States government to a [...] "fence" [...] in stolen goods and to a Mafia-like protection racket. Hurston thought it <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> same [...] "people who claim {{that it is a}} noble thing to die for freedom and democracy ... wax frothy if anyone points out the inconsistency of their morals.... We, too, consider machine gun bullets good laxatives for heathens who get constipated with toxic ideas about a country of their own." [...] She was scathing about those who sought [...] "freedoms" [...] for those abroad but denied it to people in their home countries: [...] Roosevelt [...] "can call names across an ocean" [...] for his Four Freedoms, but he did not have [...] "the courage to speak even softly at home." [...] When Truman dropped the atomic bombs on Japan she called him [...] "the Butcher of Asia." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Loebner Prize tests {{conversational}} intelligence; {{winners are}} typically chatterbot programs, or Artificial Conversational Entities (ACE)s. Early Loebner Prize rules restricted conversations: Each entry and hidden-human conversed {{on a single}} topic, thus the interrogators were restricted to one line of questioning per entity interaction. The restricted conversation rule was lifted for the 1995 Loebner Prize. Interaction duration between judge and entity has varied in Loebner Prizes. In Loebner 2003, at the University of Surrey, each interrogator was allowed five minutes to interact with an entity, machine or hidden-human. Between 2004 and 2007, the interaction time allowed in Loebner Prizes was more than twenty minutes. In 2008, the interrogation duration allowed was five minutes per pair, because the organiser, Kevin Warwick, and coordinator, Huma Shah, consider {{this to be the}} duration for any test, as Turing stated in his 1950 paper: [...] " ... making the right identification after five minutes of questioning". They felt Loebner's longer test, implemented in Loebner Prizes 2006 and 2007, was inappropriate for the state of artificial conversation technology. It is <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 2008 winning entry, Elbot from Artificial Solutions, does not mimic a human; its personality is that of a robot, yet Elbot deceived three human judges that it was the human during human-parallel comparisons.|$|E
5000|$|Burris had {{reportedly}} {{not mentioned}} fund-raising contacts allegedly made {{to him by}} Blagojevich's brother, Robert Blagojevich, in his testimony, but then filed an affidavit with Democrat impeachment committee chair Barbara Flynn Currie, listing three such contacts, shortly after February 5. Word of the new information did not reach the public, or the Republicans in the House, until its release in the Chicago Sun-Times on February 13.

5000|$|The perfect iconic {{goddess of}} True Blue had all gone. In <b>the</b> same way <b>that</b> sixties beauties like Nico, Marianne Faithfull and Brigitte Bardot set about {{destroying}} their beauty {{after they were}} famous, the very thing they felt limited them, Madonna annihilated hers.
