2500|$|Wyatt was a {{brilliant}} but facile designer, whose work is not characterized by any markedly individual style. At the time he began practice the fashionable architects were the brothers Adam, whose style of interior decoration he proceeded to imitate with such success that they complained of plagiarism {{in the introduction to}} their Works in Architecture, which appeared in 1773. Many years later Wyatt himself told George III that [...] "there had been no regular architecture since Sir William Chambers [...] that when he came from Italy he found the public taste corrupted by the Adams, and he was obliged to comply with it". Much of Wyatt's classical work is, in fact, in a chastened Adam manner with ornaments in Coade stone and [...] "Etruscan" [...] medallions executed in many cases by the painter Biagio Rebecca, who was also employed by his rivals. It was not until towards {{the end of his life}} that he and his brother Samuel (with whom must be associated their nephew Lewis) developed the severe and fastidious style of domestic architecture which is characteristic of the Wyatt manner at its best. But among Wyatt's earlier works there are several (e.g., the Christ Church gateway and the mausoleum at Cobham) which show a familiarity with Chambers Treatise on the <b>Decorative</b> <b>Part</b> of Civil Architecture, and so permit the belief that if his artistic integrity had been greater Wyatt might have continued the Chambers tradition instead of falling in with the [...] "corrupt taste" [...] of the brothers Adam. Had he been given the opportunity of designing some great public building, it is possible that he would have shown himself a true disciple of Chambers; but his career as a government architect coincided with the Napoleonic wars, and his premature death deprived him of participation in the metropolitan improvements of the reign of George IV.|$|E

The main and also most <b>decorative</b> <b>part</b> of the Clock Tower is the part where you set the clock. The entrance to the clock tower encircled by large marble blocks is located on the north side and about a hundred stairs leads to the clock, to its peak of approximately 32 m. These steps lead to the top where in the past the big metal bells stood indicating the time. In 1927 there was set the first clock mechanism developed by the German company Konfage. Those required to ring the bells were replaced with so called sajdzhii (clock keepers) who were responsible for maintaining the clock and the clock mechanism. First there was a white clock face with black numbers and hands, and was smaller than the present. This clock mechanism was replaced in 1936. When they were placed 15 new bells, heavy 900 kg - a sign of gratitude for the construction of the Memorial Cemetery of German soldiers killed in the First World War. In 1962 the mechanism was restored, and in 1970 there was placed a keyboard mechanism to play new songs. The Clock Tower is one of the 180 towers in the world which has embedded such mechanism.|$|E

40|$|Neue Museen is a 16 mm {{film about}} the radical, modernist {{exhibition}} designs of Italian post-war architect Franco Albini and his collaboration with museum director Caterina Marcenaro in the early 1950 s. The film is shot in the galleries of the Palazzo Bianco and Palazzo Rosso, and the Museo di Sant’Agostino, in Genoa. Albini and Marcenaro’s desire was to literally ‘float’ art in the museum, and the film reconstructs Albini’s unprecedented and extraordinary hydraulic lifting and rotating support for Giovanni Pisano’s ‘Fragment from the Tomb of Margaret Of Brabant’ (1313). This device, which now looks utterly eccentric, {{can be seen as}} one of the first examples of interactive museum sculpture display. The film focuses on Albini and Marcenaro’s stated desire to “emphasise the atmosphere of purity and tranquillity that surrounds a real masterpiece” as a particularly explicit example of the modernist ideology of the museum to radically decontextualise art from its surroundings. As Catherine Marcerano suggests in an article from 1954 (Museum vol. 7 no. 4, 1954) : “In the interests of education, the Palace concept was abandoned and the museum criterion strictly adhered to. In other words, the works of art were treated not as the <b>decorative</b> <b>part</b> of a given setting, but as a world in themselves, sufficient to absorb the visitor’s full attention”.
