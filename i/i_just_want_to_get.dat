2500|$|Following a pitch {{invasion}} by fans after the 2009 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final, the GAA {{confirmed that the}} presentation of the Sam Maguire Cup would take place in Croke Park's Hogan Stand. The GAA insisted that it still remained worried about {{the health and safety of}} fans and expects an accident to happen [...] "one of these days". Kerry captain Darren O'Sullivan expressed his indifference about the location: [...] "If they give [...] out in the car park around the back, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> my hands on it". During the presentation, Tadhg Kennelly did his dance which he previously did when he won the AFL Grand Final with the Sydney Swans in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Delhomme {{finished}} {{the game with}} 16 completions out of 33 attempts for 323 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions for a passer rating of 113.6. He was seen standing on the field during the Patriots' post-game celebration; he later commented: [...] "I wanted {{to catch up to}} the moment of {{what it feels like to}} be on the other side, to be on this side, the losing side. To let it sink in, to hurt, so when we start practice in the fall, the two-a-days and there are days during the season when I’m tired and I want to go home, but I need to watch that extra film. I want to get back there, but I want to get on the other side of that field. They rope you off, the losing team basically. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on the other side of that rope. I just wanted to watch and let it sink in and hurt a little bit. When I have a tough day, I’ll just think about that feeling and it will make me dig down just a little deeper." ...|$|E

I shall go straight out to the Rockies. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> where I can forget your look and the words with which your father turned me out of his house.

[...] Five hundred dollars for the pair, you know." [...] "With you the feet have nearly been the soul; [...] And if you're going to sell them to the devil, [...] I {{want to see you}} do it. When's he coming?" [...] "I half suspect you knew, and came on purpose [...] To try to help me drive a better bargain." [...] "Well, if it's true! Yours are no common feet. [...] The lawyer don't know what it is he's buying: [...] So many miles you might have walked you won't walk. [...] You haven't run your forty orchids down. [...] What does he think?--How are the blessed feet? [...] The doctor's sure you're going to walk again?" [...] "He thinks I'll hobble. It's both legs and feet." [...] "They must be terrible--I mean to look at." [...] "I haven't dared to look at them uncovered. [...] Through the bed {{blankets}} I remind myself [...] Of a starfish laid out with rigid points." [...] "The wonder is it hadn't been your head." [...] "It's hard to tell you how I managed it. [...] When I saw the shaft had me by the coat, [...] I didn't try too long to pull away, [...] Or fumble for my knife to cut away, [...] I just embraced the shaft and rode it out-- [...] Till Weiss shut off the water in the wheel-pit. [...] That's how I think I didn't lose my head. [...] But my legs got their knocks against the ceiling." [...] "Awful. Why didn't they throw off the belt [...] Instead of going clear down in the wheel-pit?" [...] "They say some time was wasted on the belt-- [...] Old streak of leather--doesn't love me much [...] Because I make him spit fire at my knuckles, [...] The way Ben Franklin used to make the kite-string. [...] That must be it. Some days he won't stay on. [...] That day a woman couldn't coax him off. [...] He's on his rounds now with his tail in his mouth [...] Snatched right and left across the silver pulleys. [...] Everything goes the same without me there. [...] You can hear the small buzz saws whine, the big saw [...] Caterwaul to the hills around the village [...] As they both bite the wood. It's all our music. [...] One ought as a good villager to like it. [...] No doubt it has a sort of prosperous sound, [...] And it's our life." [...] "Yes, when it's not our death." [...] "You make that sound as if it wasn't so [...] With everything. What we live by we die by. [...] I wonder where my lawyer is. His train's in. [...] I want this over with; I'm hot and tired." [...] "You're getting ready to do something foolish." [...] "Watch for him, will you, Will? You let him in. [...] I'd rather Mrs. Corbin didn't know; [...] I've boarded here so long, she thinks she owns me. [...] You're bad enough to manage without her." [...] "And I'm going to be worse instead of better. [...] You've got to tell me how far this is gone: [...] Have you agreed to any price?" [...] "Five hundred. [...] Five hundred--five--five! One, two, three, four, five. [...] You needn't look at me." [...] "I don't believe you." [...] "I told you, Willis, when you first came in. [...] Don't you be hard on me. I have to take [...] What I can get. You see they have the feet, [...] Which gives them the advantage in the trade. [...] I can't get back the feet in any case." [...] "But your flowers, man, you're selling out your flowers." [...] "Yes, that's one way to put it--all the flowers [...] Of every kind everywhere in this region [...] For the next forty summers--call it forty. [...] But I'm not selling those, I'm giving them, [...] They never earned me so much as one cent: [...] Money can't pay me for the loss of them. [...] No, the five hundred was the sum they named [...] To pay the doctor's bill and tide me over. [...] It's that or fight, and I don't want to fight-- [...] <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> settled in my life, [...] Such as it's going to be, and know the worst, [...] Or best--it may not be so bad. The firm [...] Promise me all the shooks I want to nail." [...] "But what about your flora of the valley?" [...] "You have me there. But that--you didn't think [...] That was worth money to me? Still I own [...] It goes against me not to finish it [...] For the friends it might bring me. By the way, [...] I had a letter from Burroughs--did I tell you?-- [...] About my Cyprepedium reginæ; [...] He says it's not reported so far north. [...] There! there's the bell. He's rung. But you go down [...] And bring him up, and don't let Mrs. Corbin.-- [...] Oh, well, we'll soon be through with it. I'm tired." [...] Willis brought up besides the Boston lawyer [...] A little barefoot girl who in the noise [...] Of heavy footsteps in the old frame house, [...] And baritone importance of the lawyer, [...] Stood for a while unnoticed with her hands [...] Shyly behind her. [...] "Well, and how is Mister----" [...] The lawyer was already in his satchel [...] As if for papers that might bear the name [...] He hadn't at command. [...] "You must excuse me, [...] I dropped in at the mill and was detained." [...] "Looking round, I suppose," [...] said Willis. [...] "Yes, [...] Well, yes." [...] "Hear anything that might prove useful?" [...] The Broken One saw Anne. [...] "Why, here is Anne. [...] What do you want, dear? Come, stand by the bed; [...] Tell me what is it?" [...] Anne just wagged her dress [...] With both hands held behind her. [...] "Guess," [...] she said. [...] "Oh, guess which hand? My my! Once on a time [...] I knew a lovely way to tell for certain [...] By looking in the ears. But I forget it. [...] Er, let me see. I think I'll take the right. [...] That's sure to be right even if it's wrong. [...] Come, hold it out. Don't change.--A Ram's Horn orchid! [...] A Ram's Horn! What would I have got, I wonder, [...] If I had chosen left. Hold out the left. [...] Another Ram's Horn! Where did you find those, [...] Under what beech tree, on what woodchuck's knoll?" [...] Anne looked at the large lawyer at her side, [...] And thought she wouldn't venture on so much. [...] "Were there no others?" [...] "There were four or five. [...] I knew you wouldn't let me pick them all." [...] "I wouldn't--so I wouldn't. You're the girl! [...] You see Anne has her lesson learned by heart." [...] "I wanted there should be some there next year." [...] "Of course you did. You left the rest for seed, [...] And for the backwoods woodchuck. You're the girl! [...] A Ram's Horn orchid seedpod for a woodchuck [...] Sounds something like. Better than farmer's beans [...] To a discriminating appetite, [...] Though the Ram's Horn is seldom to be had [...] In bushel lots--doesn't come on the market. [...] But, Anne, I'm troubled; have you told me all? [...] You're hiding something. That's as bad as lying. [...] You ask this lawyer man. And it's not safe [...] With a lawyer at hand to find you out. [...] Nothing is hidden from some people, Anne. [...] You don't tell me that where you found a Ram's Horn [...] You didn't find a Yellow Lady's Slipper. [...] What did I tell you? What? I'd blush, I would. [...] Don't you defend yourself. If it was there, [...] Where is it now, the Yellow Lady's Slipper?" [...] "Well, wait--it's common--it's too common." [...] "Common? [...] The Purple Lady's Slipper's commoner." [...] "I didn't bring a Purple Lady's Slipper [...] To You--to you I mean--they're both too common." [...] The lawyer gave a laugh among his papers [...] As if with some idea that she had scored. [...] "I've broken Anne of gathering bouquets. [...] It's not fair to the child. It can't be helped though: [...] Pressed into service means pressed out of shape. [...] Somehow I'll make it right with her--she'll see. [...] She's going to do my scouting in the field, [...] Over stone walls and all along a wood [...] And by a river bank for water flowers, [...] The floating Heart, with small leaf like a heart, [...] And at the sinus under water a fist [...] Of little fingers all kept down but one, [...] And that thrust up to blossom in the sun [...] As if to say, 'You! You're the Heart's desire.' [...] Anne has a way with flowers to take the place [...] Of that she's lost: she goes down on one knee [...] And lifts their faces by the chin to hers [...] And says their names, and leaves them where they are." [...] The lawyer wore a watch the case of which [...] Was cunningly devised to make a noise [...] Like a small pistol when he snapped it shut [...] At such a time as this. He snapped it now. [...] "Well, Anne, go, dearie. Our affair will wait. [...] The lawyer man is thinking of his train. [...] He wants to give me lots and lots of money [...] Before he goes, because I hurt myself, [...] And it may take him I don't know how long. [...] But put our flowers in water first. Will, help her: [...] The pitcher's too full for her. There's no cup? [...] Just hook them {{on the inside of the}} pitcher. [...] Now run.--Get out your documents! You see [...] I have to keep on the good side of Anne. [...] I'm a great boy to think of number one. [...] And you can't blame me in the place I'm in. [...] Who will take care of my necessities [...] Unless I do?" [...] "A pretty interlude," [...] The lawyer said. [...] "I'm sorry, but my train-- [...] Luckily terms are all agreed upon. [...] You only have to sign your name. Right--there." [...] "You, Will, stop making faces. Come round here [...] Where you can't make them. What is it you want? [...] I'll put you out with Anne. Be good or go." [...] "You don't mean you will sign that thing unread?" [...] "Make yourself useful then, and read it for me. [...] Isn't it something I have seen before?" [...] "You'll find it is. Let your friend look at it." [...] "Yes, but all that takes time, and I'm as much [...] In haste to get it over with as you. [...] But read it, read it. That's right, draw the curtain: [...] Half the time I don't know what's troubling me.-- [...] What do you say, Will? Don't you be a fool, [...] You! crumpling folkses legal documents. [...] Out with it if you've any real objection." [...] "Five hundred dollars!" [...] "What would you think right?" [...] "A thousand wouldn't be a cent too much; [...] You know it, Mr. Lawyer. The sin is [...] Accepting anything before he knows [...] Whether he's ever going to walk again. [...] It smells to me like a dishonest trick." [...] "I think--I think--from what I heard to-day-- [...] And saw myself--he would be ill-advised----" [...] "What did you hear, for instance?" [...] Willis said. [...] "Now the place where the accident occurred----" [...] The Broken One was twisted in his bed. [...] "This is between you two apparently. [...] Where I come in is what I want to know. [...] You stand up to it like a pair of cocks. [...] Go outdoors if you want to fight. Spare me. [...] When you come back, I'll have the papers signed. [...] Will pencil do? Then, please, your fountain pen. [...] One of you hold my head up from the pillow." [...] Willis flung off the bed. [...] "I wash my hands-- [...] I'm no match--no, and don't pretend to be----" [...] The lawyer gravely capped his fountain pen. [...] "You're doing the wise thing: you won't regret it. [...] We're very sorry for you." [...] Willis sneered: [...] "Who's we?--some stockholders in Boston? [...] I'll go outdoors, by gad, and won't come back." [...] "Willis, bring Anne back with you when you come. [...] Yes. Thanks for caring. Don't mind Will: he's savage. [...] He thinks you ought to pay me for my flowers. [...] You don't know what I mean about the flowers. [...] Don't stop to try to now. You'll miss your train. [...] Good-bye." [...] He flung his arms around his face.|$|E

5000|$|After nearly 30 {{years of}} {{creating}} music for Converge, Supermachiner and Irons, {{in addition to}} creating artwork not limited to album covers for dozens of bands, Jacob Bannon had an epiphany. [...] "I've {{had a lot of}} things going on in my life in the past couple of years that have made me realize that time is not infinite. The songs that you create, the art that you create, needs to go to the public if that is the intention." [...] Over his career, Bannon created music that was never publicly released, but started to change his mind about these methods. [...] "When I kept writing songs and filing them away and not sharing them with people, that was doing me a disservice creatively, so I'm now at a point in my life where <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it out to people." ...|$|E

[...] So we ended up with big sort of ballads that were almost like U2 and some grindcore stuff and some really blasty, screamy shit, and other stuff...I would love to leave some sort of legacy.

I'm pretty {{positive}} it's gonna happen... probably next year (...) We talked to some other people, and drummer Audie Desbrow would not be a person I would want to play with ever again in my life. There were some bridges burned there that I just can’t forgive, and I’m a very forgiving person. I just can’t let that one go. I have to stand up for myself..." [...] Russell's stance towards Desbrow seemed to have changed course by 2006 when he told Mitch Lafon: [...] "I talked to Michael Lardie the other day and he is into doing it. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hold of Tony Montana and Audie Desbrow. I think that would be very special for our 25th anniversary tour to have the same guys... we haven't played together in a very long time." [...] Later in 2006, guitarist Mark Kendall officially announced that Great White had re-formed its classic lineup. The re-formed lineup of Russell, Kendall, Lardie, McNabb and Desbrow played their first date together in more than 5 years on 27 January 2007 at the Keyclub in Hollywood performing in the Harpseals.org Benefit Concert for the Seals 2007.

He made stage tours in the 1980s and his last role was in Cinderella, a pantomime at Birmingham's Alex Theatre in 1989. He lived {{for a number of}} years in a tiny flat in Northolt, west London. His then agent, David Daly, said that:He was a very private man. He just decided that he would withdraw. He found a place to live and simply went into hiding. In some ways, it was not unlike him; if he decided that things weren't right, he would withdraw into himself and not contact anybody.In 1995 John Mills tried to rehouse him through the Actors Benevolent Fund but Steel refused. Steel told a journalist in 1997:This is a very difficult time for me. You can see that by where I'm living.
