25|$|The {{development}} of quadraphonic records {{was announced in}} 1971. These recorded four separate sound signals. This was achieved on the two stereo channels by electronic matrixing, where the additional channels were combined into the main signal. When the records were played, phase-detection circuits in the amplifiers were able to decode the signals into four separate channels. There were two main systems of matrixed quadraphonic records produced, confusingly named SQ (by CBS) and QS (by Sansui). They proved commercially unsuccessful, but were an important precursor to later surround sound systems, as seen in SACD and <b>home</b> <b>cinema</b> today.|$|E

500|$|In a DVD {{review of}} the third series of Spooks, Michael Mackenzie of <b>Home</b> <b>Cinema</b> had mixed views of Adam's introduction, stating [...] "despite ardent protests from both cast and crew, Tom and Adam are {{almost exactly the same}} character." [...] In the fifth series, Mackenzie felt more open towards Adam, stating Adam Carter [...] "isn't exactly James Bond [...] he doesn't jet around the world, bedding {{multiple}} women and engaging in fisticuffs atop precarious construction rigs, but he does rush around London with a gun in his hand and occasionally ends up {{on the receiving end of}} the odd beating." [...] David Blackwell of Enterline Media was receptive of Adam in the fourth series, as he felt Adam became [...] "more fleshed out and interesting." [...] However, Blackwell was critical of Adam's role in the following fifth series, stating it is [...] "too much" [...] about him.|$|E
500|$|The third series {{received}} generally favourable reviews. In {{review of}} the DVD release of the series, Michael Mackenzie of <b>Home</b> <b>Cinema</b> was disappointed by the [...] "complete decimation of the group around which the show effectively revolved," [...] and had reservations for the introductions of the new characters, stating [...] "despite ardent protests from both cast and crew, Tom and Adam are {{almost exactly the same}} character. The same goes for his wife Fiona, who more or less steps into Zoe's shoes (they even look similar!), and in the final episode, it becomes abundantly clear that, in the next season, Zafar Younis (Raza Jaffrey) will be taking Danny's place while ensuring that the [...] "minority" [...] checkbox remains ticked." [...] However, at the same time, Mackenzie thought [...] "the psychology surrounding cast changes like these is extremely interesting." [...] In terms of the storylines, the reviewer stated [...] "Spooks third season [...] is something of a step down from both its predecessors," [...] although the series [...] "has a number of fine moments." [...] Mackenzie ended up rating the series eight stars out of ten.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{towards the}} character was generally mixed. In a DVD {{review of the}} first series, Michael Mackenzie of <b>Home</b> <b>Cinema</b> thought Macfadyen {{was not a very}} good actor and believed [...] "he seems to be in some sort of contest with Keanu Reeves to see how long he can maintain the same lifeless facial expression," [...] but thought the character himself, particularly his personal life, mostly worked well for the most part as it continues [...] "as a standard soap opera." [...] In review of the second series, Dennis Landmann of MovieFreak praised the [...] "drama and intensity that builds around his character," [...] noting Tom's somewhat [...] "haunted soul" [...] and the last five minutes of the last episode [...] "were so powerful they affected how I felt {{for the next couple of}} days; I kept thinking about the character and the tragic events that happened to him." [...] In the third series, Mackenzie praised the episode where Tom tries to clear his name, but thought his exit was [...] "not particularly satisfying." [...] However, David Blackwell of Enterline Media thought that his farewell scene was [...] "one of [...] best moments of the first two episode (in addition to the way Tom acts in the opening episode)." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{advantage}} of tactile transducers used for low frequencies {{is that they}} allow a listening environment that is not filled with loud low frequency waves. This helps the drummer in a rock music band to monitor his or her kick drum performance without filling the stage with powerful, loud low frequency sound from a 15" [...] (40cm) subwoofer monitor and an amplifier, which can [...] "leak" [...] into other drum mics and lower {{the quality of the}} sound mix. By not having a large, powerful subwoofer monitor, a bass shaker also enables a drummer to lower the sound pressure levels that they are exposed to during a performance, reducing the risk of hearing damage. For <b>home</b> <b>cinema</b> or video game use, bass shakers help the user avoid disturbing others in nearby apartments or rooms, because even powerful sound effects such as explosion sounds in a war video game or the simulated rumbling of an earthquake in an adventure film will not be heard by others. However, some critics argue that the felt vibrations are disconnected from the auditory experience, and they claim that that music is less satisfying with the [...] "butt shaker" [...] than sound effects. As well, critics have claimed that the bass shaker itself can rattle during loud sound effects, which can distract the listener.|$|E

HTIB systems typically include a DVD or Blu-ray player, a surround sound amplifier, five surround speakers, a subwoofer cabinet, cables and a remote.

50|$|In the 1950s, {{home movies}} became {{popular in the}} United States and {{elsewhere}} as Kodak 8 mm film (Pathé 9.5 mm in France) and camera and projector equipment became affordable. Projected with a small, portable movie projector onto a portable screen, often without sound, this system became the first practical home theater. They were generally used to show home movies of family travels and celebrations, but they also doubled {{as a means of}} showing some commercial films, or even private stag films. Dedicated <b>home</b> <b>cinemas</b> were called screening rooms at the time and were outfitted with 16 mm or even 35 mm projectors for showing commercial films. These were found almost exclusively in the homes of the very wealthy, especially those in the movie industry.|$|R

Outdoor <b>home</b> <b>cinemas</b> are popular with BBQ parties and pool parties. Some specialist outdoor home-cinema companies are now marketing packages with inflatable movie screens and purpose-built AV systems. Some people have expanded the idea and constructed mobile drive-in theaters that can play movies in public open spaces. Usually, these require a powerful projector, a laptop or DVD player, outdoor speakers or an FM transmitter to broadcast the audio to other car radios.|$|R
