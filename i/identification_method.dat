25|$|Tattoos {{are also}} placed on animals, though rarely for {{decorative}} reasons. Pets, show animals, thoroughbred horses, and livestock are sometimes tattooed with identification and other marks. Tattooing with a 'slap mark' {{on the shoulder}} or on the ear is the standard <b>identification</b> <b>method</b> in commercial pig farming. Branding is used for similar reasons and is often performed without anesthesia, but is different from tattooing as no ink or dye is inserted during the process, the mark instead being caused by permanent scarring of the skin. Pet dogs and cats are sometimes tattooed with a serial number (usually in the ear, or on the inner thigh) via which their owners can be identified.

25|$|Diernhofer {{first used}} the name Streptococcus dysgalactiae in 1932, {{describing}} a streptococcus of veterinary origin. Subsequently, Frost reported {{the discovery of}} the human pathogen Streptococcus equisimilis in 1936. Contemporarily, though, Rebecca Lancefield devised a classification of streptococci based on their carbohydrate-antigens, and successively described streptococci belonging to group C (1933) and group G (1935). The correlation of group carbohydrate specificity with the proposed species S.dysgalactiae and S.equisimilis, however, were not explored in detail. The Lancefield classification soon became the preferred laboratory <b>identification</b> <b>method</b> for streptococci, and the names S.dysgalactiae and S.equisimilis fell into disuse. In 1980, they were even removed from the List of Approved Bacterial species. Three years later, though, DNA hybridization studies revealed extensive similarities between the entities Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus equisimilis, large-colony-forming group C and group G streptococcus of human origin, and certain large-colony-forming group C, G and L streptococci of animal origin. Accordingly, they were fused to one species, Streptococcus dysgalactiae. However, subsequent molecular investigations indicated heterogeneity within this new species, and in 1996 it was divided into S.dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis and S.dysgalactiae subspecies dysgalactiae.|$|E
25|$|All {{the recent}} {{advances}} in molecular genetics clearly permit the analysis of microbial communities at much finer and functional scales and potentially with more confidence than previous methods. The classical AM fungal <b>identification</b> <b>method</b> of spore extraction from soil and further spore morphological analysis is fraught with complicating issues due to the various strategies and forms of AM fungi, e.g., lack of sporulation in certain species, seasonality, high unculturability, possible misidentification (human error), and new evidence of multi-nucleate spores and high genetic variation within clonal AM species. Because of these various problems, in the past researchers likely misrepresented the true composition of AM fungal communities present at any {{one point in time}} or place. Additionally, by following the traditional extraction, culture and microscopic identification methods, {{there is no way to}} determine active/functioning AM fungal populations, which are likely the most important when attempting to relate plant-AM symbiotic interactions and mechanisms to ecological or ecosystem function. This is especially true in the case of root colonization analyses, which can determine percentage of roots colonized by AM fungi. The major problem with this analysis is in field soils, which contain multiple species of AM fungi in association with a target plant at the same time (see Ecology of AM). The identification of the associated fungal symbionts is impossible without the use of molecular methods. Though genetic analysis of AM fungal communities has advanced a great deal in the past decade, the methodology is not yet completely refined. Below is an overview of the methods used in molecular genetic analyses of AM fungi, along with applications to research, future directions and some of their problems.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{modeling}} of Lithium-ion batteries usually utilizes discrete-time system <b>identification</b> <b>methods</b> to estimate parameters of discrete models. However, in real applications, {{there is a}} fundamental limitation of the discrete-time methods in dealing with sensitivity when the system is stiff and the storage resolutions are limited. To overcome this problem, this paper adopts direct continuous-time system <b>identification</b> <b>methods</b> to estimate the parameters of equivalent circuit models for Lithium-ion batteries. Compared with discrete-time system <b>identification</b> <b>methods,</b> the continuous-time system <b>identification</b> <b>methods</b> provide more accurate estimates to both fast and slow dynamics in battery systems and are less sensitive to disturbances. A case of a 2 nd-order equivalent circuit model is studied which shows that the continuous-time estimates are more robust to high sampling rates, measurement noises and rounding errors. In addition, the estimation by the conventional continuous-time least squares method is further improved in the case of noisy output measurement by introducing the instrumental variable method. Simulation and experiment results validate the analysis and demonstrate the advantages of the continuous-time system <b>identification</b> <b>methods</b> in battery applications...|$|R

40|$|Service {{identification}} {{is one of}} the earliest and very crucial activities in a service engineering lifecycle and requires adequate methodological support in order to be successful.
