Escaping the dimension with his body drastically mutated, his memories and sanity initially lost, he now wields various <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> as weapons, while searching for fragments of the shattered Soul Edge that soothe the pain caused by his separation from the dimension's energies.|$|E
5|$|Demand for {{electricity}} grows with great rapidity {{as a nation}} modernises and its economy develops. The United States showed a 12% increase in demand during each year {{of the first three}} decades of the twentieth century, a rate of growth that is now being experienced by emerging economies such as those of India or China. Historically, the growth rate {{for electricity}} demand has outstripped that for other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Universe can {{be defined}} as {{everything}} that exists, everything that has existed, and everything that will exist. According to our current understanding, the Universe consists of spacetime, <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> (including electromagnetic radiation and matter), and the physical laws that relate them. The Universe encompasses all of life, all of history, and some philosophers and scientists suggest that it even encompasses ideas such as mathematics and logic.|$|E

50|$|T.Ohta {{suggested}} that the concept <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> quality may be more intuitive if one considers examples where the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> remains constant but the amount <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> flowing, or transferred is varied. For instance if we consider only the inertial <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> then the <b>energy</b> quality <b>of</b> a moving body is higher when it moves with a greater velocity. If we consider only the heat <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> then a higher temperature has higher quality. And if we consider only the light <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> then light with higher frequency has greater quality (Ohta 1994, p. 90). All these differences in energy quality are therefore easily measured with the appropriate scientific instrument.|$|R

5|$|UND is {{classified}} by the Carnegie Foundation as a doctoral/research-intensive institution. This level of research activity {{is shown in}} UND's research statistics which, in fiscal year 2006, included program awards that reached $94.3 million, sponsored program expenditures that reached $81.2 million, and an overall research portfolio that included $315 million in total ongoing and committed accounts. Research activity at UND focuses on health sciences, nutrition, energy and environmental protection, aerospace, and engineering. As {{a major component of}} the Red River Valley Research Corridor, UND operates many research units including the Energy and Environmental Research Center, the School of Medicine, the Center for Rural Health, the Center for Innovation, the Upper Midwest Aerospace Consortium, the Bureau of Governmental Affairs, the Bureau of Educational Services and Applied Research, and the Social Science Research Institute. The Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC), located on the eastern fringes of the UND campus, has been recognized as a leader in researching cleaner, more efficient <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b> The EERC operates a number of research units at UND including the National Center for Hydrogen Technology.|$|E

25|$|Matter is {{composed}} of such things as atoms, electrons, neutrons, and protons. It has intrinsic or rest mass. In the limited range of recognized experience {{of the nineteenth century}} it was found that such rest mass is conserved. Einstein's 1905 theory of special relativity showed that it corresponds to an equivalent amount of rest energy. This means that it can be converted to or from equivalent amounts of other (non-material) <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> for example kinetic energy, potential energy, and electromagnetic radiant energy. When this happens, as recognized in twentieth century experience, rest mass is not conserved, unlike the total mass or total energy. All <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> contribute to the total mass and total energy.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{electromagnetic}} mass {{is not considered}} anymore {{as the cause of}} mass per se, because the entire mass (not only the electromagnetic part) is proportional to energy, and can be converted into different <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> which is explained by Einstein's mass–energy equivalence.|$|E

25|$|In February 2012, President Sarkozy {{decided to}} {{extend the life of}} {{existing}} nuclear reactors beyond 40 years, following the Court of Audit decision that this is the best option as new nuclear capacity or other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> would be more costly and available too late.
