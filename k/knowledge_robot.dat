40|$|Abstract—A {{significant}} obstacle {{for service}} robots is the execu-tion of complex tasks in real environments. For example, {{it is not}} easy for service robots to find objects that are partially observable and are located at a place which is not identical but near the place where the robots saw them previously. To overcome the challenge effectively, <b>robot</b> <b>knowledge</b> represented as a semantic network can be extremely useful. This paper presents an ontology-based unified <b>robot</b> <b>knowledge</b> framework that integrates low-level data with high-level <b>knowledge</b> for <b>robot</b> intelligence. This frame-work consists of two sections: knowledge description and knowl-edge association. Knowledge description includes comprehensively integrated <b>robot</b> <b>knowledge</b> derived from low-level knowledge regarding perceptual features, part objects, metric maps, and primitive behaviors, as well as high-level knowledge about percep-tual concepts, objects, semantic maps, tasks, and contexts. Knowl-edge association uses logical inference with both unidirectional and bidirectional rules. This characteristic enables reasoning to be performed even when only a partial information is available. The experimental results that demonstrate the advantages of using the proposed knowledge framework are also presented.

40|$|Knowledge {{representation}} {{is a traditional}} field in artificial intelligence. Researchers have developed various ways to represent and share information among intelligent agents. Agents that share resources, data, information, and knowledge perform better than agents working alone. However, previous research also reveals that sharing knowledge among {{a large number of}} entities in an open environment is a problem yet to be solved. Intelligent robots are designed and produced by different manufacturers. They have various physical attributes and employ different knowledge representations. Therefore, any non-standard or non-widely-adopted technology is unsuitable to provide a satisfactory solution to the knowledge sharing problem. In this research, we pose <b>robot</b> <b>knowledge</b> sharing as an activity to be developed in an open environment- the World Wide Web. Just as search engines like Google provide enormous power for information exchange and sharing for humans, we believe a searching mechanism designed for intelligent agents can provide a robust approach for sharing <b>knowledge</b> among <b>robots.</b> We have developed: (1) a <b>knowledge</b> representation for <b>robots</b> that allows Internet access, (2) a knowledge organization and search indexing engine, and (3) a query/reply mechanism between robots and the search engine...|$|R

40|$|The {{challenge}} of sharing and communicating information {{is crucial in}} complex human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios. Ontologies and symbolic reasoning are the state-of-the-art approaches for a natural representation of knowledge, especially within the Semantic Web domain. In such a context, scripted paradigms have been adopted to achieve high expressiveness. Nevertheless, since symbolic reasoning is a high complexity problem, optimizing its performance requires a careful design of the <b>knowledge.</b> Specifically, a <b>robot</b> architecture requires the integration of several components implementing different behaviors and generating a series of beliefs.

40|$|Dynamic task {{allocation}} is {{an essential}} requirement for multi-robot systems functioning in unknown dynamic environments. It allows robots to change their behavior in response to environmental changes or actions of other robots {{in order to improve}} overall system performance. Emergent coordination algorithms for task allocation that use only local sensing and no direct communication between robots are attractive because they are robust and scalable. However, a lack of formal analysis tools makes emergent coordination algorithms difficult to design. In this paper we present a mathematical model of a general dynamic task allocation mechanism. Robots using this mechanism have to choose between two types of task, and the goal is to achieve a desired task division in the absence of explicit communication and global <b>knowledge.</b> <b>Robots</b> estimate the state of the environment from repeated local observations and decide which task to choose based on these observations. We model the robots and observations as stochastic processes and study the dynamics of individual robots and the collective behavior. We analyze the effect that the number of observations and the choice of decision functions have on the performance of the system. We validate the mathematical models on a multi-foraging scenario in a multi-robot system. We find that the model’s predictions agree very closely with experimental results from sensor-based simulations. ...|$|R

Technical support not only for information storage and retrieval but also for information selection, process planning, and decision support is needed.

In this paper, it is predicted that smart and mobile computing units embedded in a variety of things, such as TV sets and cars, will bring computing power close to their users.
