5|$|Protohistoric {{refers to}} the period when American Indians were exposed to European trade items and large {{population}} shifts occurred because of introduced European diseases and warfare, but {{there is very little}} direct written documentation. Explorers such as Marquette and Joliet occasionally documented American Indians along the Mississippi in Iowa, {{but it was not until}} the early 19th century that regular written accounts of American Indians in Iowa became common. American Indians in the early Protohistoric period continued many aspects of Oneota culture, but soon almost all <b>indigenous</b> <b>technology</b> disappeared, including ceramics and stone tool production. It was during this period that the Meskwaki (Fox) and Sauk appeared in eastern Iowa, displaced from their homelands in the east. Important protohistoric sites include Milford; Blood Run; Gillett Grove; and Iowaville.|$|E

25|$|China's {{semiconductor}} industry has despite extensive governmental support had many problems {{in areas such}} as innovative new designs. This may be due to factors such as poorly guided state and local government support for soon outdated technologies and geographically scattered efforts, lacking engineering education, and poor protection of intellectual property. This may change by factors such a new emphasis on market mechanisms rather than direct support, concentration of efforts, return of Chinese who have studied abroad, increased pressure on foreign companies to transfer technology, indigenous Chinese technological standards, and increased demands for <b>indigenous</b> <b>technology</b> in the local market.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the factors that}} drive technology utilisation, learning and transfer among women farmers in Nigeria. It assesses both modern and <b>indigenous</b> <b>technologies</b> used in farming activities. Three states were purposively selected from the six that comprise the South West geopolitical zone of the country. Structured questionnaire was administered to 180 women smallholder farmers who were randomly selected in equal proportion across the three states. Some 128 copies of questionnaire were retrieved representing {{a response rate of}} about 71 %. The study reveals that majority of the women (about 67 %) use <b>indigenous</b> <b>technologies</b> while only a few (17 %) and 16 % use modern technologies and a combination of both respectively. Family and friends are the main source of learning <b>indigenous</b> <b>technologies</b> while extension agents are the major source of modern. The study uses spearman correlation to determine the drivers of the dependent variables. Age, level of education, years of experience and learning intensity are significantly correlated with technology utilisation at 1 % level of confidence while primary occupation and learning have significant correlation with technology learning at 5 % and 1 % confidence level respectively. The study also reveals that farmers’ age, experience and availability of learning system are have significant correlation with technology transfer. The study advocates the introduction of need and gender-specific new technologies. There is the need for integration of <b>indigenous</b> <b>technologies</b> into research {{so that it can be}} attractive to the older women. Also, farmers should be integrated into the technology development process. This will help in sustaining the rising interest of younger women in adapting modern and <b>indigenous</b> <b>technologies</b> in agriculture. The study also advocates the need for deeper and broader interactions among key actors, such as, R&D institutions, extension agents, NGOs, CBOs and farmers on the effectiveness and variety of channels used in technology learning, utilisation and transfer. Appropriate public policy interventions should also be introduced to develop ‘smallholder-friendly’ technologies, especially among women, to curb market failures in technology adoption...|$|R

40|$|Research into <b>Indigenous</b> Knowledge System <b>Technology</b> (IKST) {{has been}} {{receiving}} increasing attention from research institutions and Government Ministries in Namibia {{during the last}} five years. Indigenous communities in Namibia possess a rich traditional knowledge expressed in many practices in their communities. This study aims to present and identify general indigenous practices that have potentials for development in four regions in Namibia. These regions were Omaheke, Oshikoto, Omusati and the Kavango. These <b>indigenous</b> <b>technologies</b> covered medical, pharmaceutical, indigenous food, tanning, construction and infrastructure technologies and household equipment of the local. This research article also presents Namibia’s best <b>Indigenous</b> Knowledge System <b>Technology</b> practices as compared to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Netherlands organisation for international cooperation in higher education (Nuffic) protocols.

40|$|The {{abandonment}} of indigenous and traditional ways of {{relating to the}} landscape and making use of the environment are historically tied, since the epoch of conquest, to the imposition of development models that respond to foreign demands.
