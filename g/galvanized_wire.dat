Actual tensile strength of corroded wires did not decrease with corrosion levels, whereas elongation and torsional strength decreased sharply after the zinc layer was partly depleted and the steel started to corrode. The accumulated amounts of diffusive hydrogen of corroded wires with and without induced tension were almost the same and were well below a critical value of 0. 7 ppm. Therefore, induced tensions of steel wires {{did not affect the}} amount of diffusive hydrogen and below the critical concentration to cause brittleness. Fatigue strength did not change only when the galvanized layer was corroded, but it significantly decreased after the steel corrosion below the galvanized layer progressed. The corrosion fatigue life under wet conditions was shorter than that under dry conditions. The endurance life of pre-split steel wires was decreased in stress amplitude and increased in load frequency under fluctuating loading and corrosive environment, the aggressive media accelerated the growth rate of the fatigue crack...|$|R

Elsewhere <b>galvanized</b> <b>wire</b> or even rope may be used because of its availability and cheapness.3 types of {{stainless steel}} wire are commonly used. Type 1 x 19 is a non-flexible wire used for standing rigging such as stays.

Type 7 x 19 is used for all halyards, wire sheets, vangs and strops that must run through a pulley (sheave). The common way of attaching wire is to form a small loop at the end which is fixed in place by clamping a soft metal swage over the free ends. Talurite is a common brand of swagging. The wire loop is then fastened to a rigging screw with a bow shackle to the chain plate. Kevlar rope is sometimes used in place of wire in small sailboats.|$|E
