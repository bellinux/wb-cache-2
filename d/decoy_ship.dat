5|$|The {{merchant}} ship SS Mamari III was converted to resemble Hermes as a <b>decoy</b> <b>ship</b> {{to confuse the}} Axis where Hermes was actually operating. The superstructure was mainly a wooden mock-up. She {{was a part of}} the phantom fleet of mock-up British warships designated as Fleet Tender C. On 4 June 1941, when she was sailing down the east coast of England to Chatham Dockyard in Kent to be converted back to a {{merchant ship}}, the decoy Hermes hit a submerged wreck and ran aground off Norfolk during a German aerial attack. Before being refloated she was totally disabled by German E-boats commanded by Niels Bätge. The Germans initially thought they had sunk an aircraft carrier.|$|E
500|$|On 14 August, the 59-ton British fishing smack Bona Fide {{was stopped}} by a U-boat, boarded, and sunk with {{explosives}} [...] east-northeast of Lowestoft. According to the website Uboat.net, this attack was likely by UB-4, because she was operating in the area on her fourteenth patrol. Regardless of the identity of Bona Fides attacker, UB-4 did approach a group of smacks in the vicinity the next day, but unbeknownst to UB-4s commander, Gross, one of the fishing vessels was actually a British <b>decoy</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E
500|$|In July, I'll Try {{was renamed}} Nelson and Boy Alfred became Ethel & Millie, {{in an effort}} to {{maintain}} their cover. The boats continued to operate together and Crisp's crew was augmented with two regular seamen and a Royal Marine rifleman, providing the Nelson with a crew of ten, including Crisp and his son. The smacks set out as usual on 15 August and pulled in a catch during the morning before making a sweep near the Jim Howe Bank in search of cruising enemies. At 2.30 pm, Crisp spotted a German U-boat on the surface [...] away. The U-boat also sighted the smack and both vessels began firing at once, the U-boat's weapon scoring several hits before Nelson's could be brought to bear. By this stage in the war, German submarine captains were aware of the <b>decoy</b> <b>ship</b> tactics and no longer stopped British merchant shipping, preferring to sink them from a distance with gunfire.|$|E
50|$|A {{traditional}} legend is of wreckers deliberately <b>decoying</b> <b>ships</b> on to coasts using tricks (in particular false lights), so {{that they}} run ashore and can be plundered. While this has been depicted in many stories and legends, it is uncertain that this has ever happened.|$|R
5|$|Six {{days into}} her first war patrol, on 22 March 1916, U-68 was sunk by , a British Q-ship, with all hands. U-68 sank no ships in her brief career. A post-war German study found fault with U-68s captain for not {{following}} established procedures for avoiding <b>decoy</b> <b>ships.</b>|$|R
5|$|A post-war German study faulted U-68s commander, Kptlt. Güntzel, {{for failing}} to follow {{established}} procedures for dealing with neutral-flagged vessels {{in order to avoid}} <b>decoy</b> <b>ships</b> like Farnborough. According to the report, Güntzel had broken almost all the rules when approaching Farnborough. However, Kommodore Hermann Bauer, the commander of the German High Seas Fleet U-boats, in his post-war memoirs, reports Güntzel was an inexperienced captain and had not, contrary to usual practice, been first sent to sea under a more experienced U-boat captain to gain knowledge.|$|R

5000|$|At this time, the U.S. Navy {{began looking}} for a smaller coastal vessel {{to serve as a}} Q-ship, {{complementing}} the larger <b>decoy</b> <b>ships</b> , , and [...] Purchased on 16 November 1942, for about US$12,000, the schooner was renamed Irene Forsyte and given hull designation symbol IX-93 on 7 December. She was delivered to the Thames Shipyard of New London, Connecticut, for conversion. Fitted with new engines, quick-firing armament, as well as concealed radar and sonar equipment, the auxiliary was commissioned 26 August 1943, Lieutenant Commander Richard Parmenter in command.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{option was}} to arm and man <b>decoy</b> <b>ships</b> with hidden guns, the {{so-called}} Q-ship. A variant {{on the idea}} was to equip small vessels with a submarine escort. In 1915, three U-boats were sunk by Q-ships, and two more by submarines accompanying trawlers. In June also [...] was sunk by [...] while attacking Taranaki, and in July U-23 was sunk by C-27 attacking Princess Louise. Also in July U-36 was sunk by the Q-ship Prince Charles, and in August and September [...] and [...] were sunk by Baralong, the former in the notorious Baralong Incident.|$|R
5000|$|During the First World War Granton harbour {{was used}} as the base for mine-sweeping equipment: mainly Scottish {{trawlers}} and their crews, called into active service and conscripted as part of the Royal Navy Reserve. During this period the harbour was officially renamed as [...] "HMS Gunner" [...] when referred to in military documents, in reference to the name of the largest trawler in its fleet. The harbour was then home to mine-sweepers, <b>decoy</b> <b>ships</b> (Q-ships), and anti-submarine vessels. The north section held smaller support vessels specifically built for Navy use, including 24 motor launches, 18 paddle mine-sweepers, and 30 boom-defence vessels, with a total of 103 craft.|$|R
50|$|Various sources record her {{simply as}} having been sunk on 24 May by a German <b>decoy</b> <b>ship,</b> though this clashes with the known attack on V100 on the 26th and the {{observations}} reported by Wilson and Goodhart in subsequent days. It {{is quite possible that}} this is a garbling of an encounter between one of the Russian submarines and a decoy vessel around the same time. The German <b>decoy</b> <b>ship</b> Kronprinz Wilhelm (known as Schiff K) did attack two submarines during E18s patrol in May. K rammed the Russian Gerpard and the following day took the Russian Bars under fire in Hano Bay, the Germans thought they had sunk both submarines, E18 was not in the area of these actions.|$|E

There he meets the chief of Vayuputras, Mithra, who {{turns out to be}} his maternal uncle. Mithra convinces the Vayuputras that Shiva is the real Neelkanth and gives him the Pashupathiastra which acts on a specific target, rather than annihilating everything like the Brahmastra. Meanwhile, Parvateshwar uses <b>decoy</b> <b>ships</b> to give an impression to Kali {{that he was going to}} attack Panchavati.

The Kriegsmarine employed hundreds of auxiliary Vorpostenboote during the war, mostly civilian ships that were drafted and fitted with military equipment, for use in coastal operations.|$|R
50|$|Assigned to the 5th Naval District, Helvetia {{initially}} was deployed as a <b>decoy</b> <b>ship</b> teamed with a U.S Navy submarine following her during antisubmarine patrols off the United States East Coast. It was hoped that her innocent appearance would lure unsuspecting German submarines {{to the surface}} to attack her with gunfire, allowing the submerged U.S. Navy submarine nearby to torpedo and sink them. However, Helvetia never encountered a German submarine.|$|E

With the aid of Gambit, Storm regains her adult memories and defeats Nanny and the Orphan-Maker, sending the cyborg duo and their ship crashing into a swamp.|$|E
50|$|Sailing to Boston on 23 April, Big Horn {{entered the}} Boston Navy Yard for {{conversion}} to a Q-ship. A disguised heavily armed merchantman, the <b>decoy</b> <b>ship</b> {{was intended to}} lure unsuspecting U-boats {{to the surface and}} sink them with gunfire. While at Boston, Big Horn completed her disguise as a fleet oiler and was given extra watertight integrity - in case she was torpedoed - by the installation of thousands of sealed empty drums in her cargo tanks. That work was completed on 22 July 1942.|$|E
5000|$|With Bibulus’s {{death in}} early 48 BC, Libo was given {{command of the}} Pompeian fleet, {{comprising}} some fifty galleys. [...] He continued blockading Oricum, but {{came to the conclusion}} that if could close off Brundisium from the sea, Caesar could receive no additional reinforcements, and he could redeploy the fleet elsewhere. Moving off to Brundisium, he caught the local commander, Mark Antony, unprepared. Libo burnt a number of storage ships, captured one full of grain, and landed troops on the island that commanded the entrance to the harbour, expelling a squad of Antony’s troops in the process. Confident of success, he sent a letter to Pompey, advising him that he had secured the harbour and that the rest of the fleet should be repaired and rested. [...] Antony, in the meantime, managed to trick Libo into pursuing some <b>decoy</b> <b>ships,</b> causing Libo’s squadron to be trapped and attacked. Most of Libo’s fleet managed to escape, but the troops he landed on the island were trapped and captured.|$|R

50|$|Arabia {{was built}} as a {{commercial}} fishing schooner {{of the same name}} in 1903 at Essex, Massachusetts. With World War I raging, the German submarine U-117 created havoc with the New England commercial fishing fleet during the summer of 1918, and the U.S. Navy acquired Arabia on 13 August 1918 from the Commonwealth Fisheries Company for use as a <b>decoy</b> <b>ship</b> in antisubmarine operations against U-117. She was assigned the naval registry identification number 3434 and commissioned on 14 August 1918 at Boston, Massachusetts, as USS Arabia (ID-3434) with Lieutenant, junior grade, Lester F.

50|$|Stevenson's {{narration}} {{begins with}} a series of seemingly unrelated vignettes, of which the only one that is readily sensible occurred during World War I, leading the last survivors of a sinking <b>decoy</b> <b>ship,</b> Stevenson managed to sink a German submarine, and with the British survivors wounded and with no way of taking prisoners, killed the Germans as they attempted to surrender. That incident still haunts him. Quite wealthy, he runs a flotilla of coastal steamers in a desultory but increasingly profitable way. He awakens, after having been taken, injured, from a damaged car, on a night on which he has been drinking heavily.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} {{the year}} 49 BC, Caesar, already the ruler of Gaul, had {{captured}} Italy, Spain, Sicily, and Sardinia out of Optimates control. In early 48 BC, he prepared to sail with seven legions to Greece to face Pompey. Caesar had entrusted the defense of Illyricum to Gaius Antonius, Antony's younger brother, and Publius Cornelius Dolabella. Pompey's forces, however, defeated them and assumed control of the Adriatic Sea along with it. Additionally, the two legions they commanded defected to Pompey. Without their fleet, Caesar lacked the necessary transport ships to cross into Greece with his seven legions. Instead, he sailed with only two and placed Antony in command of the remaining five at Brundisium with instructions to join him as soon as he was able. In early 48 BC, Lucius Scribonius Libo was given command of Pompey's fleet, comprising some fifty galleys. Moving off to Brundisium, he blockaded Antony. Antony, however, managed to trick Libo into pursuing some <b>decoy</b> <b>ships,</b> causing Libo’s squadron to be trapped and attacked. Most of Libo’s fleet managed to escape, but several of his troops were trapped and captured. With Libo gone, Antony joined Caesar in Greece by March 48 BC.|$|R

50|$|Robert H. McCurdy {{remained}} in the Norfolk area until mid-August 1918, when she moved to Lewes, Delaware, joining the submarine tender USS Savannah (Submarine Tender No. 8) there as a unit of Division 8 of the United States Atlantic Fleet submarine force. She operated from Lewes as a <b>decoy</b> <b>ship</b> teamed with a U.S Navy submarine following her during antisubmarine patrols off the United States East Coast.

5000|$|The concept {{behind the}} use of Arabia as a <b>decoy</b> <b>ship</b> was for her to deploy into U-117s presumed {{operating}} area teamed with a U.S Navy submarine, which would follow her.

Also, the initial claims of Vincennes being called for help by a cargo ship attacked by Iranian gunboats have been ruled out. That leads to claims that the Iranian gunboats were provoked by helicopters inside Iranian waters {{and not the other}} way around. This might have contributed to the mistakes made.|$|R
