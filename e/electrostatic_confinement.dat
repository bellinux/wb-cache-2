25|$|Over the years, fusion {{researchers}} have investigated various confinement concepts. The early {{emphasis was on}} three main systems: z-pinch, stellarator and magnetic mirror. The current leading designs are the tokamak and inertial confinement (ICF) by laser. Both designs are being built at very large scales, most notably the ITER tokamak in France, and the National Ignition Facility laser in the USA. Researchers are also studying other designs that may offer cheaper approaches. Among these alternatives there is increasing interest in magnetized target fusion and inertial <b>electrostatic</b> <b>confinement.</b>|$|E
40|$|We study {{electron}} transport in quasi-one-dimensional wires {{at relatively}} weak <b>electrostatic</b> <b>confinements,</b> where the Coulomb interaction distorts the ground state, {{leading to the}} bifurcation of the electronic system into two rows. Evidence of finite coupling between the rows, resulting in bonding and antibonding states, is observed. At high dc source-drain bias, a structure is observed at 0. 5 (2 e^ 2 /h) due to parallel double-row transport, along with a structure at 0. 25 (2 e^ 2 /h), providing further evidence of coupling between the two rows.

By means of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations it is shown how conductance is modulated {{by the presence of}} the DNA intruder {{and as a result of}} competing <b>electrostatic</b> and <b>confinement</b> factors. The theoretical results reproduce quantitatively the experimental ones and are summarized in a conductance diagram that allows distinguishing the region of reduced conductivity from the region of enhanced conductivity as a function of molarity and the pore dimension.

2500|$|The fusor is an {{apparatus}} invented by Philo T. Farnsworth in 1959 to create nuclear fusion.

40|$|The {{significance}} of basic experiments on field-aligned plasma-potential structure formed by local {{electron cyclotron resonance}} (ECR) is claimed based on {{the historical development of}} the investigation on electric double layer and <b>electrostatic</b> potential <b>confinement</b> of open-ended fusion-oriented plasmas. In the presence of a single ECR point in simple mirror-type configurations of magnetic field, a potential dip (thermal barrier) appears around this point, being followed by a subsequent potential hump (plug potential) along a collisionless pJasma flow. The observed phenomenon gives a clear-cut physics to the formation of field-aligned plug potential with thermal barrier, which is closely related to the double layer formation triggered by a negative dip.

5000|$|What {{particularly}} interested Farnsworth about {{the device was}} its ability to focus electrons at a particular point. One {{of the biggest problems}} in fusion research is to keep the hot fuel from hitting the walls of the container. If this is allowed to happen, the fuel cannot be kept hot enough for the fusion reaction to occur. Farnsworth reasoned that he could build an <b>electrostatic</b> plasma <b>confinement</b> system in which the [...] "wall" [...] fields of the reactor were electrons or ions being held in place by the multipactor. Fuel could then be injected through the wall, and once inside it would be unable to escape. He called this concept a virtual electrode, and the system as a whole the fusor.|$|R
40|$|We combine <b>electrostatic</b> and {{magnetic}} <b>confinement</b> {{to define a}} quantum dot in bilayer graphene. The employed geometry couples $n$-doped reservoirs to a $p$-doped dot. At magnetic field values around $B = 2 ~$T, Coulomb blockade is observed. This demonstrates that the coupling of the co-propagating modes at the $p$-$n$ interface is weak enough to form a tunnel barrier, facilitating transport of single charge carriers onto the dot. This result may be of use for quantum Hall interferometry experiments...|$|R

In the case of SOI capacitors, the electron density has been computed for a large range of effective field (between 0. 1 MV/cm and 1 MV/cm) and for various silicon film thicknesses (between 5 nm and 20 nm). A good agreement with the Schroedinger-Poisson results is obtained both on the total inversion charge and on the electron density profiles.

Ballistic transport phenomena, including the quenching of the Hall resistance, the last Hall plateau, and a strong negative bend resistance, are observed at 4 K in cross junctions with sharp corners. In a ring geometry, we have observed Aharonov-Bohm interference that exhibits characteristics {{different from those of the}} GaAs counterpart due to the ballistic nature of electron transport and the narrowness of the conducting channel width.

2500|$|There {{are also}} <b>{{electrostatic}}</b> <b>confinement</b> fusion devices. These devices confine ions using electrostatic fields. The best known is the Fusor. This device has a cathode inside an anode wire cage. Positive ions fly towards the negative inner cage, and are heated by the electric {{field in the}} process. If they miss the inner cage they can collide and fuse. Ions typically hit the cathode, however, creating prohibitory high conduction losses. Also, fusion rates in fusors are very low because of competing physical effects, such as energy loss {{in the form of}} light radiation. Designs have been proposed to avoid the problems associated with the cage, by generating the field using a non-neutral cloud. These include a plasma oscillating device, a [...] a penning trap and the polywell. The technology is relatively immature, however, and many scientific and engineering questions remain.|$|E

At yet higher electric fields, impact ionization leads to an exponential increase of the current in the ⟨ 111 ⟩ oriented Ge NW segments.

30|$|With {{the fast}} {{development}} and improvement of experimental techniques [1 – 9], much important physical properties in QD molecules such as electronic structures, electronic transport, and thermoelectric effects et al have widely attracted academic attention [10 – 29]. QDs {{can be realized}} by etching a two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) {{below the surface of}} AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures or by an <b>electrostatic</b> potential. <b>Confinement</b> of particles in all three spatial directions results in the discrete energy levels such like an atom or a molecule. We can therefore think of QDs as artificial atoms or molecules. The small sizes of QDs make the phase-coherent of waves become more important, and quantum interference phenomena emerge when the particles moves along different transport paths. Fano resonances, known in the atomic physics, arise from quantum interference effects between resonant and nonresonant processes [30]. The main embodying of the Fano resonances is the asymmetric line profile in the transmission spectrum, which originates from the coexistence the resonant transmission peak and the resonant transmission dip. The first experiment observation of the asymmetrical Fano line shape in the QD system has been reported in a single-electron transistor [31].|$|R

The present model is significantly expanded over Brophy’s original work by including self-consistent calculations of the internal neutral pressure, electron temperature, primary electron density, <b>electrostatic</b> ion <b>confinement</b> (due to the ring-cusp fields), plasma potential, discharge stability, and time dependent behavior during recycling. The model only requires information on the thruster geometry, ion optics performance and electrical inputs such as discharge voltage and currents, etc. to produce accurate performance curves of discharge loss versus mass utilization efficiency.

40|$|Ultra Thin Body (UTB) MOSFETs offer a {{solution}} to the extreme challenges facing the scaling of single gate MOSFETs to nanometre dimensions [1]. Working UTB transistors with a channel length of 6 nm have been successfully demonstrated already [2]. It is clear, however that in order to achieve a reasonable electrostatic integrity at channel lengths smaller than 10 nm the silicon channel thickness in such devices has to be reduced below 3 nm. At such thickness the atomic scale roughness of the top and bottom interfaces, which is on the scale of ± 1 atomic layer (~ 3 nm on each side), will introduce appreciable UTB thickness variation. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 in a cartoon of a 10 nm gate length UTB MOSFET constructed using Photoshop ™ from real TEM images of Si/SiO 2 and PolySi/SiO 2 interfaces. It has been demonstrated experimentally that, averaged over a large sample, the body thickness variation results in an extra quantum mechanical shift in the threshold voltage and mobility degradation with the reduction in body thickness [3]. The correlation length of the interface roughness, which determines the body thickness variation, is comparable to the dimensions of the nanoscale UTB MOSFETs and therefore the pattern of the body thickness in each individual device is expected to be different. This inevitably will introduce parameter variations related to local <b>electrostatic,</b> quantum <b>confinement</b> and mobility variations...|$|R

These new coupled size-effects illustrated for Silicon clusters arise out of the size-dependency of the mechanical strain which has traditionally been ignored and devoid in classical continuum field theories (and what is typically employed by most current studies of strain-quantum dot coupling). The surface energies which induce the aforementioned size-effect are themselves found to be size-dependent for extremely small cluster size and peak within a very narrow cluster size range (0. 6 – 2 nm) ...|$|R

We show that the charge transfer from doped NCs towards a two-dimensional layer experimentally follows a simple phenomenological law, corresponding to formation of an interface dipole linearly increasing with the NC diameter. This feature leads to analytically predictable junction properties down to quantum size regimes: NC depletion width independent of the NC size and varying as N 1 = 3 D, and depleted charge linearly increasing with the NC diameter and varying as N 1 = 3 D.

40|$|Abstract. We analyze {{transport}} {{data from}} a quantum point contact (QPC), fabricated on a modulation doped Si/SiGe heterostructure, to extract experimental estimates for the valley splitting. The experimental data are fit to a form derived from a valley coupling theory {{that takes into account}} the fact that the quantum well is grown on a miscut substrate. The results of the fitting analysis are compared to results obtained by fitting to a simple phenomenological form; both methods indicate that <b>electrostatic</b> and magnetic <b>confinement</b> enhance the valley splitting by reducing the lateral spatial extent of the electronic wavefunction. Consequently, the valley splitting can be much larger than the spin splitting for small magnetic fields. We observe different valley splittings for the two lowest orbital modes of the QPC, supporting the notion that when steps are present at the quantum well interface, the spatial extent of the wavefunction plays a dominant role in determining the valley splitting...|$|R
