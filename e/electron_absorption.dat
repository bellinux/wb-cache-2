40|$|An {{analysis}} of the <b>electron</b> <b>absorption</b> signature observed by the Cosmic Ray System (CRS) on Voyage 2 near the orbit of Mimas is presented. We find that these observations cannot be explained as the absorption signature of Mimas. Combing Pioneer 11 and Voyager 2 measurements of the electron flux at Mimas's orbit (L= 3. 1), we find an electron spectrum {{where most of the}} flux above approx 100 keV is concentrated near 1 to 3 MeV. The expected Mimas absorption signature is calculated from this spectrum neglecting radial diffusion. A lower limit on the diffusion coefficient for MeV electrons is obtained. With a diffusion coefficient this large, both the Voyager 2 and the Pioneer 11 small-scale <b>electron</b> <b>absorption</b> signature observations in Mimas's orbit are enigmatic. Thus we refer to the mechanism for producing these signatures as the Mimas ghost.

It {{is the first time}} the electron pressure profile in a tokamak plasma can be measured directly with a time resolution of 1 ms. The diagnostic measures simultaneously the emission and absorption of the second harmonic electron cyclotron frequencies. Microwaves are injected from the high field side and detected at the low field side in the equatorial midplane. The transmitted power is measured after a single pass through the plasma column. The absorption measurements are complicated by nonresonant losses: refraction of the injected microwaves (losses up to 100 %), and scattering of microwaves by density fluctuations (losses 2 %- 3 %). A fast algorithm {{has been developed}} to obtain a quantitative measure for these nonresonant losses. This calculation method is based on a parametrization of the experimental data. Combining the <b>electron</b> cyclotron <b>absorption</b> (ECA) measurements and the parametrization provides a reliable tool for determining the optical depth, the electron temperature, and the electron pressure.
