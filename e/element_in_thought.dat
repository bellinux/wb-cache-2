Examples include the insertion of game <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> <b>thoughts,</b> perceptions and dreams, the use of specific vocabulary or slang – typical to the game world – in everyday conversations, and the association of real-life objects with game elements. Results from an online survey with habitual players of World of Warcraft confirm {{the existence of this}} phenomenon and show that the occurrence of these game-biased perceptions and associations is reinforced by increasing playing time and narrative involvement...|$|R

40|$|J. S. Mill regards {{individuality}} as {{the most}} fundamental of human interests – the principal condition of and main ingredient in self-development. But {{in addition to the}} individualist-functionalist <b>element</b> <b>in</b> Mill’s <b>thought</b> there is also a strong element of fallibilism derived from an empiricist view of the nature and possibilities of human knowledge. A corollary of Mill’s fallibilism is his conception of human nature as essentially open and incomplete. His doctrine of individuality and self-development, on the other hand, implies that the individual is definable by certain necessary and permanent characteristics. Following a discussion of the empiricist and fallibilist strain in Mill’s liberalism, the present paper offers an interpretation of Mill’s view that reconciles these two seemingly discordant <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> his understanding of man...|$|R

30|$|Zadeh (1973) {{explains}} that the conventional quantitative techniques of system analysis are incompatible for addressing humanistic systems. He notes that as the complexity of a system increases, the precision of statements about its behavior leads to exclusive characteristics, and precise quantitative analyses {{of the behavior of}} a humanistic system are then likely to be irrelevant. An alternative approach, he suggests, is based on the notion that the key <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> human <b>thought</b> processes are not numbers but labels of fuzzy sets. The logic that plays a basic role in fuzzy theory is that the most important facet of human thinking is the ability to summarize information into linguistic characteristics that are relevant to the task at hand.|$|R

Then we discuss the elements of Castoridis’ critique of bureaucracy as a way to distinguish between totalitarian society and democracy. This is the basis for understanding {{the relation between}} the imaginary, freedom and autonomy as basic elements of democracy. Finally the paper discusses Castoridis’ new notion of democracy as a kind of self-limitation and creation of collective meaning as the basis for social legitimacy...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> Yeats' <b>thought</b> is his view of the tragic basis of art. This conception, which can best be called a tragic aesthetic, was developed shortly after 1900 in three prose works [...] certain fragments of the Samhain publication (1904), "Poetry and Tradition" (1907), and "The Tragic Theatre" (1910). The tragic view developed in these essays became the conceptual basis behind much of Yeats' poetry and therefore {{played a central role in}} the direction of his career. This thesis traces the lineaments of Yeats' tragic aesthetic in these early essays, determining its outline in the dreamy, often vague language in which it is expressed, and shows its impact on his poetry from 1904 to the end of his career in 1939...|$|R
5000|$|This {{view was}} {{challenged}} by Bernard Bailyn and Gordon S.

[...] Garry Wills, on the other hand, maintains that it was neither the Lockean tradition nor the classical republican tradition that drove the revolution, but instead Scottish moral philosophy, a political philosophy that based its conception of society on friendship, sensibility and the controlled passions. Thomas Pangle and Michael Zuckert have countered, demonstrating numerous <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> the <b>thought</b> of more influential founders that have a Lockean pedigree.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the intricate {{problem of how}} to make a proper assessment of the esoteric <b>element</b> <b>in</b> the <b>thought</b> of the Russian philosopher Nikolai Berdiaev (1874 - 1948). It argues that the only viable solution is to take an integrative approach that attempts to incorporate a set of different perspectives. In line with this argument, a tripartite model is applied, which reveals a certain complexity in Berdiaev's esotericism and in his relation to contemporary esoteric currents. On the one hand, it demonstrates Berdiaev's palpable interest in esotericism and the presence of esoteric motifs in his philosophy, but on the other, his great reservations about esoteric movements such as Anthroposophy and Theosophy, and his desire to establish a Christian Theosophy that in his opinion would differ from these currents of thought...|$|R

50|$|Against this, Khatami {{shows how}} {{he is able to}} {{overcome}} this conception in the name of an ontetic subjectivity gained by stepping back to the Persian traditional philosophy. There are two crucial elements to Khatami's appropriation of Persian philosophy: first, the focus on cognition, and the connection of cognition with Being; second, the focus on Being itself as the event of prior and partial disclosure in which we are already involved and that can never be made completely transparent. Both of these elements are connected with Khatami's response to the subjectivist <b>element</b> <b>in</b> modern <b>thought.</b> By turning back to the direct experience, and to the concept of Being as prior and partial disclosure, Khatami was able to develop an alternative to subjectivism that also connected with the ideas taken from Suhravardi, and Mulla Sadra, and of the hermeneutical ontology of Heidegger.|$|R
5000|$|A {{classic example}} of a binary {{opposition}} is the presence-absence dichotomy.

40|$|The {{standard}} {{reading of}} Rawls’ political theory puts great emphasis on Rawls’ liberalism and {{the primacy of}} basic liberties. The standard reading usually ignores Rawls’ remark that {{he is trying to}} develop most appropriate moral basis for a democratic society. An alternative reading, offered in the article, tries to bring out the democratic <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> Rawls’ <b>thought</b> and present Rawls’ concern for social justice as an attempt to offer a plausible account of a democratic community and the preconditions for democratic legitimacy. Still, the alternative reading has to be carefully distinguished from the interpretation of Rawls offered by Richard Rorty who claims that Rawls is only articulating the liberal and democratic features of present day societies without ambitions to justify their practices and political culture. For the alternative democratic readings of Rawls it is crucial to understand the “problem of stability” and Rawls’ solution to it...|$|R
40|$|This article {{traces the}} mixed {{fortunes}} of what intellectuals like Paul Tiyambe Zeleza {{refer to as}} the ‘posts’ (poststructuralism, postmodernism and postcolonialism) in African studies. It documents the historical processes and intellectual developments that, starting from the 1980 s, laid the ground for an integration of deconstructive <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> the <b>thought</b> of African scholars. Despite the support garnered from scholars like Achille Mbembe, the ‘posts’ have encountered in African studies a high degree of opposition, if not outright hostility. Deconstructionism was perceived by many theorists to dangerously depart from the pressing ethico-political concerns and humanistic imperatives of the African intellectual agenda. Mbembe's concept of Afropolitanism is similarly being criticized for magnifying some of the theoretical prejudices and weaknesses of which the ‘posts’ (and particularly postcolonial studies) had already been accused. The article concludes by discussing some theoretical solutions put forward by African scholars to move away from rigid conceptions of cultural essentialism while retaining a notion of identity stable enough to be mobilized politically and ideologically...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This article {{seeks to}} {{demonstrate}} that implicit within Weber’s writings on charisma are tools that can enable a processual, social constructionist understanding of charismatic formation. A corollary of this point is that Weber’s writings represent an historically crucial {{turning point in the}} progression from a Carlylian idea of leaders as inherently powerful to a non-essentialist, sociological perspective, and that Weber’s inspiration for this progression is best understood not through reference to his nineteenth-century forbearers in the social sciences, but rather in his contrast with the very few theological writers (namely Rudolph Sohm and the writers of the New Testament) who actually had employed charisma as a term prior to Weber’s famous appropriation of it. A reinterpretation and retranslation of Weber’s writings on charisma that gives priority to the social constructionist <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> his <b>thought</b> can provide tools for navigating through many of the interpretational controversies that have plagued charisma research.
