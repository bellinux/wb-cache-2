5|$|Characteristics differ {{between various}} groups of Icelandic horses, {{depending}} on the focus of individual breeders. Some focus on animals for pack and draft work, which are conformationally distinct from those bred for work under saddle, which are carefully selected <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to perform the traditional Icelandic gaits. Others are bred solely for horsemeat. Some breeders focus on favored coat colors.|$|E
5|$|Labradors are {{powerful}} and indefatigable swimmers noted <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> {{to tolerate the}} coldest of water for extended periods of time. Their ability to work quietly alongside hunters while watching for birds to fall from the sky, marking where they land, and then using their outstanding nose to find and retrieve dead or wounded birds has made them the king of waterfowl retrievers.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia nigrocincta, {{commonly}} known as the jumper ant or jumping jack, is an ant of the genus Myrmecia. The species was first described by Frederick Smith in 1858. Colonies of this ant are abundant in eastern Australia. Ants of this species are known <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to jump several inches, and they also have a powerful, venomous sting. Rather than foraging on the ground, M. nigrocincta prefer to forage in trees where they are known to pollinate certain flowers.|$|E

5|$|Planarians, a {{subgroup}} of seriates, are famous <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to regenerate if divided by cuts across their bodies. Experiments show that, in fragments {{that do not}} already have a head, a new head grows most quickly on those closest to the original head. This suggests {{the growth of a}} head is controlled by a chemical whose concentration diminishes from head to tail. Many turbellarians clone themselves by transverse or longitudinal division, and others, especially acoels, reproduce by budding.|$|E

5|$|The {{domestic}} cat (Felis silvestris catus or Felis catus) is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They {{are often}} called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats {{when there is}} no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.|$|E

5|$|According to Pulitzer Prize winner Jhumpa Lahiri, Narayan's {{short stories}} {{have the same}} {{captivating}} feeling as his novels, with most of them less than ten pages long, and taking about as many minutes to read. She adds that between the title sentence and the end, Narayan provides the reader something novelists struggle to achieve in hundreds more pages: a complete insight {{to the lives of}} his characters. These characteristics and abilities led Lahiri to classify him as belonging to the pantheon of short-story geniuses that include O. Henry, Frank O'Connor and Flannery O'Connor. Lahiri also compares him to Guy de Maupassant <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to compress the narrative without losing the story, and the common themes of middle-class life written with an unyielding and unpitying vision.|$|E

They have also transported supplies and personnel as part of relief efforts following natural disasters in Australia, Japan, New Zealand and several other countries. The C-17s are highly regarded throughout the Australian military <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to carry large amounts of cargo across long distances, and the process through which they were acquired {{has been identified as}} an example of good practice in defence procurement.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{with the}} options {{available}} for treating sexual dysfunction in men (for whom results are concretely observable), those available for women are limited. For example, PDE5 inhibitors, oral medications for treating erectile dysfunction in men, {{have been tested}} <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to increase sexual responses such as arousal and orgasm in womenâ€”but no controlled trials {{have been done in}} women with SCI, and trials in other women yielded only inconclusive results. In theory, women's sexual response could be improved using a vacuum device made to draw blood into the clitoris, but few studies on treatments for sexual function in women with SCI have been carried out. There is a particular paucity of information outside the area of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes are {{generally}} globular proteins, acting {{alone or in}} larger complexes. The sequence of the amino acids specifies the structure which in turn determines the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Although structure determines function, a novel enzymatic activity cannot yet be predicted from structure alone. Enzyme structures unfold (denature) when heated or exposed to chemical denaturants and this disruption to the structure typically causes a loss of activity. Enzyme denaturation is normally linked to temperatures above a species' normal level; as a result, enzymes from bacteria living in volcanic environments such as hot springs are prized by industrial users <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to function at high temperatures, allowing enzyme-catalysed reactions to be operated {{at a very high}} rate.|$|E
5|$|Roman Catholic {{and more}} {{traditional}} Protestant clergy wear green vestments at liturgical celebrations during Ordinary Time. In the Eastern Catholic Church, green {{is the color}} of Pentecost. Green is one of the Christmas colors as well, possibly dating back to pre-Christian times, when evergreens were worshiped <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to maintain their color through the winter season. Romans used green holly and evergreen as decorations for their winter solstice celebration called Saturnalia, which eventually evolved into a Christmas celebration. In Ireland and Scotland especially, green is used to represent Catholics, while orange is used to represent Protestantism. This is shown on the national flag of Ireland.|$|E

5|$|The Terrans are {{a fictional}} future version of {{humanity}} in the StarCraft series. The Terrans {{are the most}} splintered of the StarCraft species, consisting of multiple factions that not only fight the other races but each other as well.

The Terrans have been dedicated a full campaign in each real-time strategy video game installment to date, and are defined in-game by their specialization of units and tactics of defense and mobility.
