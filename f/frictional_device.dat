A pin-on-disc tribometer was adapted for this purpose. The originality of this metrology is the use of a pin comprising a transmissive infrared window and an optical fiber two-color pyrometer. Local temperatures are evaluated at the pin–disc interface thanks to the optical fiber inserted in the pin. The experimental local temperatures correlate well with the disc surface temperature calculated with an analytical solution found in the literature for a pin-on-disc <b>frictional</b> <b>device.</b> In addition, disc temperature at the exit from the contact area is measured by a monochromatic pyrometer. The monochromatic temperature is corrected by taking into account the emissivity obtained by two-color pyrometry. Results show that the difference between the local temperatures in the pin-disc contact area and the corrected temperature obtained by the monochromatic pyrometry at the exit from the contact area remains weak. Besides, a good correlation was found between the local contact temperature and the friction torque. Thus, the knowledge of the local contact temperature is necessary to determine the modification of the tribological behavior at the pin-on-disc interface...|$|E
40|$|Friction-induced {{oscillations}} {{occur in}} many engineering systems, often resulting in noise, vibration, and excessive or uneven wear. This research addresses {{the suppression of}} such oscillations, especially with application to braking systems, {{through the use of}} high-frequency dither signals. Brake squeal is an annoying and elusive problem too often present in braking systems of automobiles, trucks and aircraft. In previous work, the effectiveness of high-frequency dither to eliminate squeal in an automotive disc brake assembly was demonstrated experimentally. The main features of the dither-squeal cancellation system was the application of a high frequency variation in the brake pressure force accomplished by means of a piezoelectric stack placed behind one of the brake pads. This thesis contains a theoretical and numerical treatment of the application of dither to frictional systems. Two types of systems are investigated. The first is a classic, mass-on-a-moving belt problem, which experiences friction-induced oscillations similar to those encountered in brake applications. The system is first studied using an analytical technique based on the method of averaging. It is shown that, depending on the system, friction, dither-waveform, and belt-speed parameters, dither can stabilize an unstable system. However, in some cases, dither can destabilize an initially stable system. These results are verified numerically using time integration. The second type of system analyzed in this thesis is an annular plate with a rotating <b>frictional</b> <b>device.</b> The method of multiple scales is used to predict subcritical regions of instability; the results are validated using Floquet theory. The thesis treats both tangential and normal dither, the latter being closer to the brake application. It is found that normal dither, in addition to being harder to analyze, is much less effective than tangential dither. Ph. D. Committee Co-Chair: Aldo A. Ferri; Committee Co-Chair: Kenneth A.

The A.minus hook is suitable for fibres, already a feasible substrate for illustration of a viable frictional, probabilistic attachment mechanism that is biomimetic to A.minus, whereas the grasshopper and bee tarsi would be suitable for a silent probabilistic frictional attachment mechanism with further work on a suitable supplementary substrate.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{numerical}} {{and analytical}} results of previous literature contributions, the paper investigates the dynamic behaviour of a structural two-way straight cable-net façade subjected to medium-level blast loads. Numerical studies are dedicated, specifically, to a cable-net prototype already experimentally investigated under seismic loads. Several numerical finite-element (FE) models are developed in ABAQUS/Standard. A geometrically simplified, lumped-mass FE-model (M 01), a detailed cable-glass model (M 02) and a further simplified but computationally efficient cable-glass model (M 03) are presented. The models are assessed and calibrated to test data of literature, {{as well as}} to simplified SDOF analytical formulations, in order to investigate the dynamic response of the façade under high-rate impulsive loads. Since axial forces in the cables and maximum stresses in the glass panels abruptly increase when the explosion occurs, specific viscoelastic and <b>frictional</b> <b>devices</b> are applied at the connection between glass and cables, {{as well as at the}} end of the cables. The main advantage of the presented technological solution is given by the partial dissipation of the incoming energy. In the first case, viscoelastic connectors add flexibility to the point-supported glass elements, hence reducing the amount of incoming blast energy. In the latter case, <b>frictional</b> <b>devices</b> dissipate through friction mechanisms the strain energy stored by the bearing cable-net. A proper combination of these multiple devices, in conclusion, can manifest a marked increase of structural efficiency for the examined structural typology...|$|R
40|$|Superconducting (SC) strands are {{composite}} materials: {{they are}} usually made of a normal metal matrix where superconducting filaments are embedded. The main {{purpose of this paper}} consists in developing a simple but effective approach based on rheological models, to simulate the global elastic-plastic behavior of SC wires. In particular, starting from Prandtl generalized scheme, the strand elastic modulus and elastic-plastic tangent modulus are obtained at different temperatures. The wire mechanics is studied by taking into consideration both the longitudinal behavior (along the axis of the wire) and the transversal one (on the plane section of the wire itself). Concerning the longitudinal axis, the constitutive materials are represented by a system of mechanisms arranged in parallel: normal metals are represented by a series of springs and <b>frictional</b> <b>devices,</b> while superconducting filaments are considered as a single spring, because of their elastic properties. Concerning the transversal behavior, the scheme is more complex, therefore the cross section is subdivided into stripes. Each stripe, which is represented by a series of springs and <b>frictional</b> <b>devices,</b> is arranged in parallel with the other ones. Finally, to show the effectiveness of the presented method, three different wires are taken into consideration and results obtained are compared with numerical ones previously calculated by means of virtual testing homogenization and finite element (FE) analysis. The presented approach allows studying the elastic- plastic behavior of complex composite materials in a simple way, without the need of FE method or the use of complex homogenization techniques...|$|R
40|$|The main {{scope of}} this paper is to present {{rheological}} models that can simulate the non-linear behavior of superconducting strands at different temperatures. In detail, these models estimate the values of the elastic modulus (E) and the elastic-plastic tangent modulus (H) in a very simple and efficient way. Superconducting strands are composite materials; they are usually made of a normal metal matrix where superconducting filaments are embedded. The wire mechanics is studied by taking into consideration both the longitudinal behavior (along the axis of the wire) and the transversal one (on the plane section of the wire itself). Concerning the longitudinal axis, the constitutive materials are represented by a system of mechanisms arranged in parallel: normal metals are represented by a series of springs and <b>frictional</b> <b>devices,</b> while superconducting filaments are considered as single springs, because of their elastic behavior. With respect to the transversal plane, two models are developed. In the first one all materials are considered as a composition of systems of mechanisms (springs and <b>frictional</b> <b>devices)</b> arranged in series. In the second one, which is more accurate, the cross section of the wire is subdivided into different stripes. Each stripe is represented again by a composition of mechanisms and is considered in parallel with the other stripes. Different wires are taken into consideration and their elastic modulus and elastic-plastic tangent modulus are obtained. The three models developed for each strand are compared with numerical results obtained in previous works with the finite element method and virtual testing technique...|$|R

40|$|We propose in {{this paper}} an {{analytical}} study of the temperature distribution in a solid subjected to moving heat sources. The power dissipated by the heat sources is considered nonuniform. The study was made in steady state. The model is three-dimensional. It is valid regardless of the relative velocity of the source. We have considered three cases of semi-elliptic {{distribution of the power}} with: (i) the maximum {{at the center of the}} source, (ii) the maximum at the inlet of the source, (iii) the maximum at the output of the source. These configurations simulate the conformity imperfection of contact due to wear and / or the non-uniformity of contact pressure in <b>frictional</b> <b>devices.</b> We compare the temperature change for these different scenarios and for different relative velocities, considering the same total power dissipation. The reference case is that of a uniform source dissipating the same power...|$|R
40|$|Evolutionarily {{optimized}} <b>frictional</b> <b>devices</b> {{of insects}} are usually adapted to attach {{to a variety}} of natural surfaces. Orthopteran attachment pads are composed of hexagonal outgrowths with smooth flexible surfaces. The pads are designed to balance the weight of the insect in different positions and on different materials. In a scanning electron microscopy study followed by freezing-substitution experiments, the ultrastructural architecture of the pad material was visualized. In friction experiments, the interaction was measured between the attachment pad and a polished silicon surface. The inner structure of this material contains distally directed rods, branching close to the surface, and spaces filled with fluid. The specific design of the pad material provides a higher frictional force in the distal direction. Frictional anisotropy is more enhanced at higher normal forces and lower sliding velocities. It is concluded that optimal mechanical functionality of biosystems {{is the result of a}} combination of surface structuring and material design...|$|R
40|$|A glazing fac¸ade {{subjected}} to blast loads has a structural behaviour that strongly differs fromthe typical response of a glazing system {{subjected to}} ordinary loads. Consequently, sophisticatedmodelling techniques {{are required to}} identify correctly its criticalities. The paper investigates the behaviour of a cable-supported fac¸ade subjected to high-level blast loading. Nonlinear dynamic analyses are performed in ABAQUS/Explicit using a sophisticated FE-model (M 01), calibrated to dynamic experimental and numerical results. The structural effects of the total design blast impulse, as well as only its positive phase, are analyzed. At the same time, the possible cracking of glass panels is taken into account, since this phenomenon could modify {{the response of the}} entire fac¸ade. Finally, deep investigations are dedicated to the bearing cables, since subjecting them to elevated axial forces and their collapse could compromise the integrity of the cladding wall. Based on results of previous studies, <b>frictional</b> <b>devices</b> differently applied at their ends are presented to improve the response of the fac¸ade under the impact of a high-level explosion. Structural effects of various solutions are highlighted through dynamic simulations. Single vertical devices, if appropriately calibrated, allow reducing significantly the axial forces in cables, and lightly the tensile stresses in glass panes...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the structural response of a high-level air blast loaded cable-supported façade. Since the glass panels and the cables present a typical brittle behavior and {{are subjected to}} elevated tensile stresses when a high-level explosion occurs, multiple dissipative devices are simultaneously introduced in the conventional glazing system to mitigate the maximum effects of the design blast wave. Dynamic analyses are performed using a sophisticated FE-model to describe accurately {{the response of the}} façade equipped by dissipative devices. Based on numerical results of previous contributions, viscoelastic spider connectors (VESCs) are introduced in the points of connection between glass panels and pretensioned cables, to replace “rigid” spider connectors commonly used in practice. At the same time, rigid-plastic <b>frictional</b> <b>devices</b> (RPDs) are installed {{at the top of the}} bearing cables to mitigate furthermore the bracing system. As a result, due to the combined use of VESCs and RPDs opportunely calibrated, the maximum tensile stresses in the glass panels and in the cables appear strongly reduced. In addition, the proposed devices do not trouble the aesthetics of such transparent structural systems. At last, simple design rules are presented to predict the response of cable-supported façades subjected to high-level dynamic loads and to preliminary estimate the mechanical parameters of combined VESCs and RPDs...|$|R

40|$|Ring springs are <b>frictional</b> <b>devices</b> {{consisting}} of {{inner and outer}} ring elements assembled to form a spring stack. External load applied to the spring produces sliding action across mating ring interfaces. Large amounts of energy, as much as 60 - 70 % of the total cycle energy, may be absorbed in overcoming frictional forces. This thesis details the characteristics and dynamic behaviour of ring spring systems and describes the design and testing of a seismic isolation system that uses ring springs. Initially the characteristics and fundamental dynamic behaviour of single-degree-of-freedom mass/ring spring systems are studied. This study uses a model based upon the non-linear force/deflection characteristics of the ring spring. A prototype ring spring cartridge that enables dynamic inputs {{to be applied to}} a ring spring was then designed and subjected to short duration shock excitation. Experimental results are compared with those given by computer simulation and are seen to be in good agreement. Ring springs have been identified as suitable devices for use in earthquake-resistant structures. A particularly attractive candidate for use of ring springs is in protecting columnar structures during earthquakes. To enable further study, a pivotal rocking seismic isolation system was developed. So that computational analyses of these systems could be undertaken, the ring spring model has been incorporated within the computer program RUAUMOKO. Dynamic analyses using RUAUMOKO show that pivotal rocking isolation systems can significantly reduce structural loads during short period type earthquakes. Subsequently, a pivotal rocking seismic isolation system was designed and manufactured. Shaker table tests were then carried out on the rocking system for a range of earthquake inputs. The experimental results show that for columnar structures with fundamental periods in the range of dominant spectral accelerations, structural loads can be significantly reduced during short period type earthquakes. Experimental results compare well with those given by computer simulation, thus confirming the effectiveness of the isolation system. The work outlined in this thesis has established a basis from which further research can be undertaken. The pivotal rocking seismic isolation system developed has potential application to protecting a wide range of columnar structures during short period type earthquakes...|$|R
40|$|In {{structural}} engineering, vibrations {{created by}} transient loads input {{energy to the}} structure. Control devices {{can be used to}} dissipate this energy in a civil structure. In this research, a new semi-active dissipation device is studied: the Modified Friction Device (MFD). The MFD is a control device that consists of a spring, a viscous element and a braking element similar to car brakes. Because it is still a conceptual design, the <b>device's</b> <b>frictional</b> behavior has been modeled using the LuGre friction model that takes the stiction and Stribeck effect into account in the dynamic behavior. Then, several simulations have been run to evaluate how the device behaves and how it dissipates energy in a structure under seismic and wind loads. Three interesting results emerged. Firstly, the LuGre friction model is a very good approximation for this device, as the comparison between experimental data from a friction device and the model to adapt the model parameters showed. Secondly, the MFD can display a behavior similar to the MR damper but with a more mechanically robust and reliable system. Thirdly, several control schemes have been implemented and the MFD {{can be used as a}} force actuator as well as a passive device. Furthermore, this device meets realistic constraints of control and constructability. by Mohamed Abdellaoui Maane. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|Friction {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and {{influential}} mechanical interactions of two structures on both the macroscopic scale and especially the microscopic scale. On the microscopic scale, friction becomes the prime component of mechanical forces exerted on <b>devices.</b> <b>Frictional</b> anisotropy is an interesting characteristic of certain materials and can be used to control frictional properties in various applications. In this study, we measured the anisotropic frictional behavior of two silver (Ag) thin films: a continuous film and a thin film consisting of tilted nanorods angled at an average angle of 70 o to the surface normal. Scratches, eight microns in length, were performed on the films with normal loads ranging from 50 ÂµN to 8, 000 ÂµN using a conical tip with a 100 micron tip radius. The coefficient of friction (COF) of the tilted nanorods was measured for scratches performed along, against, and perpendicular to the tilt direction. In addition, the deformation of the individual scratches was visually characterized with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The tilted nanorods demonstrated significant frictional anisotropy with the COF of scratches performed against the tilt direction being over 30 percent lower than those performed along the tilt direction. Furthermore, for normal loads up to 2000 ÂµN, the tilted nanorod sample displayed a lower COF than the thin film for scratches performed against the tilt direction. Visual deformation analysis showed a large increase in damage as the normal load was systematically raised from 50 ÂµN to 8000 ÂµN. In addition, the deformations of the nanorods are shown to be dependent on the direction of the scratch...|$|R
