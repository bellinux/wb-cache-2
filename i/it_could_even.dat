Recent research by ex-Wuppertal Institute member Joachim Spangenberg, working with neo-classical economists, shows that the transition, if focused on improving resource productivity, leads to higher economic growth than business as usual, {{while at the same time}} reducing pressures on the environment and enhancing employment.|$|E

25|$|Egyptologists such as Thomas Schneider, Michael Haase, and Rainer Stadelmann {{wonder if}} the {{compiler}} of the Turin Canon actually took into account that the cattle count was performed biennially {{during the first half}} of the Old Kingdom period, whilst tax collection during the 19th dynasty was held every year. In sum, all these documents would prove that Khufu ruled for at least 26 or 27 years, and possibly for over 34 years, if the inscription in the relieving chambers point to a biennial cattle count. Indeed, if the compiler of the Turin Canon did not take into account a biennial cattle count, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> mean that Khufu ruled for 46 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} Aemilius' {{invasion}} of Samnium {{may have been}} exaggerated; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> have been entirely invented by a later writer to bring the war to an end with Rome in a suitably triumphant fashion. The sparse mentions of praetors in the sources for the 4th century are generally thought to be historical; it is possible therefore that as praetor Ti. Aemilius really {{was involved in the}} peace negotiations with the Samnites. The First Samnite War ended in a negotiated peace rather than one part dominating the other. The Romans had to accept that the Sidicini belonged to the Samnite sphere, but their alliance with the Campani was a far greater prize. Campania's wealth and manpower was a major addition to Rome's strength.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{there is}} a range of ulterior motives for Israel's denial of Palestinian statehood. If Palestine were {{declared}} a state, then immediately, Israel, by its present occupation of the West Bank will be in breach of the United Nations Charter. Palestine, as a state, could legitimately call upon the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense under Article 51 of the Charter to remove Israel from the occupied territories. Palestine, as a state, {{would be able to}} accede to international conventions and bring legal action against Israel on various matters. Palestine could accede to various international human rights instruments, such as the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> join the International Criminal Court and file cases against Israel for war crimes.

500|$|In October 1940 Hitler {{disclosed}} to Benito Mussolini {{that he intended}} to leave the Netherlands semi-independent because he wanted that country to retain its overseas colonial empire after the war. This factor was removed after the Japanese took over the Netherlands East Indies, the primary component of that domain. The resulting German plans for the Netherlands suggested its transformation into a Gau Westland, which would eventually be further broken-up into five new Gaue or gewesten (historical Dutch term for a type of sub-national polity). Fritz Schmidt, a ranking German official in the occupied Netherlands who hoped to become the Gauleiter of this new province on Germany's western periphery stated that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> be called Gau Holland, as long as the Wilhelmus (the Dutch national anthem) and similar patriotic symbols were to be forbidden.

500|$|The Mary Rose {{was kept}} in reserve from 1522 to 1545. She was once more caulked and {{repaired}} in [...] 1527 in a newly dug dock at Portsmouth and her longboat was repaired and trimmed. Little documentation about the Mary Rose between 1528 and 1539 exists. A document written by Thomas Cromwell in 1536 specifies that the Mary Rose and six other ships were [...] "made new" [...] during his service under the king, though it is unclear which years {{he was referring to}} and what [...] "made new" [...] actually meant. A later document from January 1536 by an anonymous author states that the Mary Rose and other ships were [...] "new made", and dating of timbers from the ship confirms some type of repair being done in 1535 or 1536. This would have coincided with the controversial dissolution of the monasteries that resulted in a major influx of funds into the royal treasury. The nature and extent of this repair is unknown. Many experts, including Margaret Rule, the project leader for the raising of the Mary Rose, have assumed that it meant a complete rebuilding from clinker planking to carvel planking, and that it was only after 1536 that the ship took on the form that it had when it sank and that was eventually recovered in the 20th century. Marsden has speculated that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>even</b> mean that the Mary Rose was originally built in a style that was closer to 15th-century ships, with a rounded, rather than square, stern and without the main deck gunports.|$|E
