5|$|As a {{complete}} normed space, Hilbert spaces are by definition also Banach spaces. As such they are topological vector spaces, in which topological notions like the openness and closedness of subsets are well-defined. Of special importance {{is the notion}} of a closed linear subspace of a Hilbert space that, with the <b>inner</b> <b>product</b> induced by restriction, is also complete (being a closed set in {{a complete}} metric space) and therefore a Hilbert space in its own right.|$|E

40|$|Zeros of {{orthogonal}} polynomials {{associated with}} two different Sobolev <b>inner</b> <b>products</b> involving the Jacobi measure are studied. In particular, {{each of these}} Sobolev <b>inner</b> <b>products</b> involves a pair of closely related Jacobi measures.

Existence, real character, location and interlacing properties for the zeros of these Jacobi-Sobolev orthogonal polynomials are deduced. © 2010 SBMAC...|$|R
40|$|Complete {{solutions}} {{are given in}} a closed analytic form for unambiguous discrimination of three 	general pure states with real mutual <b>inner</b> <b>products.</b> For this purpose, we first establish some general 	results on unambiguous discrimination of n linearly independent pure states. The uniqueness of 	solution is proved. The condition under which the problem is reduced to an (n− 1) -state problem is 	clarified. After giving the solution for three pure states with real mutual <b>inner</b> <b>products,</b> we examine 	some difficulties in extending our method {{to the case of}} complex <b>inner</b> <b>products.</b> There is a class of 	set of three pure states with complex <b>inner</b> <b>products</b> for which we obtain an analytical solution...|$|R
5|$|Riemannian {{manifolds}} are manifolds whose tangent {{spaces are}} endowed with a suitable <b>inner</b> <b>product.</b> Derived therefrom, the Riemann curvature tensor encodes all curvatures of a manifold in one object, which finds applications in general relativity, for example, where the Einstein curvature tensor describes {{the matter and}} energy content of space-time. The tangent space of a Lie group can be given naturally {{the structure of a}} Lie algebra and can be used to classify compact Lie groups.|$|E
5|$|The <b>inner</b> <b>product</b> {{between two}} state vectors {{is a complex}} number known as a {{probability}} amplitude. During an ideal measurement of a quantum mechanical system, {{the probability that a}} system collapses from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate is given by the square of the absolute value of the probability amplitudes between the initial and final states. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator—which explains the choice of self-adjoint operators, for all the eigenvalues must be real. The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator.|$|E
5|$|The {{mathematical}} {{concept of}} a Hilbert space, named after David Hilbert, generalizes the notion of Euclidean space. It extends the methods of vector algebra and calculus from the two-dimensional Euclidean plane and three-dimensional space to spaces with any finite or infinite number of dimensions. A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the structure of an <b>inner</b> <b>product</b> that allows length and angle to be measured. Furthermore, Hilbert spaces are complete: there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used.|$|E
50|$|Chebyshev {{iteration}} {{avoids the}} computation of <b>inner</b> <b>products</b> as {{is necessary for}} the other nonstationary methods. For some distributed-memory architectures these <b>inner</b> <b>products</b> are a bottleneck with respect to efficiency. The price one pays for avoiding <b>inner</b> <b>products</b> is that the method requires enough knowledge about spectrum of the coefficient matrix A, that is an upper estimate for the upper eigenvalue and lower estimate for the lower eigenvalue. There are modifications of the method for nonsymmetric matrices A.|$|R

5|$|Vector {{spaces are}} the subject of linear algebra and are well {{characterized}} by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces arise naturally in mathematical analysis, as function spaces, whose vectors are functions. These vector spaces are generally endowed with additional structure, which may be a topology, allowing the consideration of issues of proximity and continuity. Among these topologies, those that are defined by a norm or <b>inner</b> <b>product</b> are more commonly used, as having a notion of distance between two vectors. This is particularly the case of Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces, which are fundamental in mathematical analysis.|$|E
25|$|An <b>inner</b> <b>product</b> {{naturally}} induces {{an associated}} norm, thus an <b>inner</b> <b>product</b> space {{is also a}} normed vector space. A complete space with an <b>inner</b> <b>product</b> is called a Hilbert space. An (incomplete) space with an <b>inner</b> <b>product</b> is called a pre-Hilbert space, since its completion {{with respect to the}} norm induced by the <b>inner</b> <b>product</b> is a Hilbert space. <b>Inner</b> <b>product</b> spaces over the field of complex numbers are sometimes referred to as unitary spaces.|$|E
25|$|In linear algebra, an <b>inner</b> <b>product</b> {{space is}} a vector space with an {{additional}} structure called an <b>inner</b> <b>product.</b> This additional structure associates each pair of vectors in the space with a scalar quantity known as the <b>inner</b> <b>product</b> of the vectors. Inner products allow the rigorous introduction of intuitive geometrical notions such as {{the length of a}} vector or the angle between two vectors. They also provide the means of defining orthogonality between vectors (zero <b>inner</b> <b>product).</b> <b>Inner</b> <b>product</b> spaces generalize Euclidean spaces (in which the <b>inner</b> <b>product</b> is the dot product, also known as the scalar product) to vector spaces of any (possibly infinite) dimension, and are studied in functional analysis.|$|E

It turns out that it is only sufficient to compute the pairwise <b>inner</b> <b>products</b> among the feature maps for the observed covariate vectors and these <b>inner</b> <b>products</b> are simply given by the values of the kernel function evaluated at the corresponding pairs of covariate vectors. The pairwise <b>inner</b> <b>products</b> so obtained may therefore be represented {{in the form of a}} [...] symmetric non-negative definite matrix also known as the kernel matrix.|$|R

25|$|Since {{the notions}} of vector length and angle between vectors can be {{generalized}} to any n-dimensional <b>inner</b> <b>product</b> space, this is also true for {{the notions of}} orthogonal projection of a vector, projection of a vector onto another, and rejection of a vector from another. In some cases, the <b>inner</b> <b>product</b> coincides with the dot product. Whenever they don't coincide, the <b>inner</b> <b>product</b> is used instead of the dot product in the formal definitions of projection and rejection.|$|E
25|$|Spacetime is {{equipped}} with an indefinite non-degenerate bilinear form, variously called the Minkowski metric, the Minkowski norm squared or Minkowski <b>inner</b> <b>product</b> {{depending on the context}} The Minkowski <b>inner</b> <b>product</b> is defined as to yield the spacetime interval between two events when given their coordinate difference vector as argument. Equipped with this <b>inner</b> <b>product,</b> the mathematical model of spacetime is called Minkowski space. The analogue of the Galilean group for Minkowski space, preserving the spacetime interval (as opposed to the spatial Euclidean distance) is the Poincaré group.|$|E
25|$|To measure {{distances}} and angles on manifolds, the manifold must be Riemannian. A 'Riemannian manifold' is a differentiable manifold {{in which each}} tangent space is equipped with an <b>inner</b> <b>product</b> ⟨⋅,⋅⟩ in a manner which varies smoothly from point to point. Given two tangent vectors u and v, the <b>inner</b> <b>product</b> ⟨u,v⟩ gives a real number. The dot (or scalar) product is a typical example of an <b>inner</b> <b>product.</b> This allows one to define various notions such as length, angles, areas (or volumes), curvature and divergence of vector fields.|$|E
