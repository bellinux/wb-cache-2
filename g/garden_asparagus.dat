50|$|Asparagus rust {{is found}} {{worldwide}} wherever <b>garden</b> <b>asparagus</b> (Asparagus officinalis) is grown. As with many crop diseases, rust disease caused by Puccinia asparagi spreads rapidly due to poor field maintenance and close proximity of crop fields - asparagus rust was enabled to establish itself from New Jersey to California in five years. The disease {{has long been}} known in Europe, but did not attain prominence in the United States until 1902. Since then, the rust has spread to every important asparagus-growing region in the United States. Even in areas with climate ill suited to support vegetation, such as the Imperial Valley of California, have reported severe rust damage, with many crop fields having 100% infection rate. Puccinia asparagi also attacks a number of nonedible species of asparagus, including A. brouseopetii, A. caspius, A. maritimus, A. medeoloides, asparagus fern (A. plumosus), and A. verticillatus. It has also been observed to attack the common onion, Welsh or Spanish onion, chives, and shallot.|$|E
40|$|<b>Garden</b> <b>asparagus</b> (Asparagus officinalis L.) is {{a commercially}} {{important}} crop species utilized for its excellent source of vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber. However, after harvest the tissue hardens and its quality rapidly deteriorates because spear cell walls become rigidified due to lignification and substantial increases in heteroxylan content. This latter observation prompted us {{to investigate the}} in vitro xylan xylosyltransferase (XylT) activity in asparagus. The current model system for studying heteroxylan biosynthesis, Arabidopsis, whilst a powerful genetic system, displays relatively low xylan XylT activity in in vitro microsomal preparations compared with <b>garden</b> <b>asparagus</b> therefore hampering our ability to study the molecular mechanism(s) of heteroxylan assembly. Here, we analyzed physiological and biochemical changes of <b>garden</b> <b>asparagus</b> spears stored at 4 °C after harvest and detected {{a high level of}} xylan XylT activity that accounts for this increased heteroxylan. The xylan XylT catalytic activity is at least thirteen-fold higher than that reported for previously published species, including Arabidopsis and grasses. A biochemical assay was optimized and up to seven successive Xyl residues were incorporated to extend the xylotetraose (Xyl 4) acceptor backbone. To further elucidate the xylan biosynthesis mechanism, we used RNA-seq to generate an Asparagus reference transcriptome and identified five putative xylan biosynthetic genes (AoIRX 9, AoIRX 9 -L, AoIRX 10, AoIRX 14 _A, AoIRX 14 _B) with AoIRX 9 having an expression profile that is distinct from the other genes. We propose that Asparagus provides an ideal biochemical system to investigate the biochemical aspects of heteroxylan biosynthesis and also offers the additional benefit of being able to study the lignification process during plant stem maturation.

50|$|La Quintinie {{supervised}} the gardens {{until his death}} in 1688. His post was occupied briefly by his colleague, Nicolas Besnard, and then was taken over François Le Normand in 1690. Le Normand's two sons and their descendants ran the potager du Roi for the next ninety years. They created a new <b>garden</b> for raising <b>asparagus,</b> and had to make major reparations to the garden after the extreme cold spell of 1709.|$|R
50|$|The New Garden {{was laid}} out by Lady Strickland after she married Lord Strickland in 1926. An Englishwoman, Lady Strickland came from a culture that reveres gardens and, being {{extremely}} wealthy in her own right, {{she was able to}} indulge her passion for gardens by letting her imagination run loose on the grounds of Villa Bologna. Thus, assisted by her friend, Count Giuseppe Teuma Castelletti, she laid out large gardens along the western side of the villa. The New Garden was most likely inspired by Villa Frere and La Mortola in Italy. She greatly increased the acreage of the estate, bringing the total up to around 7.3 acres and she added a line of cypresses recalling the famous gardens of La Mortola on the Italian Riviera. Moreover, she planted Malta’s first grapefruit and avocado trees, an exotic vegetable <b>garden,</b> including <b>asparagus,</b> and cherry trees as well as tangerines. Furthermore, she increased the height of the property’s walls and adorned them with crenels as well as hexagonal towers. Among the trees she added are carob trees, Norfolk pines and palm trees. Perhaps the most spectacular additions she put in were the Dolphin Pond and the Sunken Pond, two ponds that, for beauty and character, have no equal in Malta. Finally, she installed a watering system of irrigation channels made of stone and supplied by an underwater reservoir.|$|R

60|$|The Rev. Wilfrid Gaspilton, in one {{of those}} {{clerical}} migrations inconsequent-seeming to the lay mind, had removed from the moderately fashionable parish of St. Luke’s, Kensingate, to the immoderately rural parish of St. Chuddocks, somewhere in Yondershire. There were doubtless substantial advantages connected with the move, but there were certainly some very obvious drawbacks. Neither the migratory clergyman nor his wife were able to adapt themselves naturally and comfortably to the conditions of country life. Beryl, Mrs. Gaspilton, had always looked indulgently on the country as a place where people of irreproachable income and hospitable instincts cultivated tennis-lawns and rose-gardens and Jacobean pleasaunces, wherein selected gatherings of interested week-end guests might disport themselves. Mrs. Gaspilton considered herself as distinctly an interesting personality, and from a limited standpoint she was doubtless right. She had indolent dark eyes and a comfortable chin, which belied the slightly plaintive inflection which she threw into her voice at suitable intervals. She was tolerably well satisfied with the smaller advantages of life, but she regretted that Fate had not seen its way to reserve for her some of the ampler successes for which she felt herself well qualified. She would have liked to be the centre of a literary, slightly political salon, where discerning satellites might have recognised the breadth of her outlook on human affairs and the undoubted smallness of her feet. As it was, Destiny had chosen for her that she should be the wife of a rector, and had now further decreed that a country rectory should be the background to her existence. She rapidly made up her mind that her surroundings did not call for exploration; Noah had predicted the Flood, but no one expected him to swim about in it. Digging in a wet garden or trudging through muddy lanes were exertions which she did not propose to undertake. As long as the <b>garden</b> produced <b>asparagus</b> and carnations at pleasingly frequent intervals Mrs. Gaspilton was content to approve of its expense and otherwise ignore its existence. She would fold herself up, so to speak, in an elegant, indolent little world of her own, enjoying the minor recreations of being gently rude to the doctor’s wife and continuing the leisurely production of her one literary effort, The Forbidden Horsepond, a translation of Baptiste Leopoy’s L’Abreuvoir interdit. It was a labour which had already been so long drawn-out that it seemed probable that Baptiste Lepoy would drop out of vogue before her translation of his temporarily famous novel was finished. However, the languid prosecution of the work had invested Mrs. Gaspilton with a certain literary dignity, even in Kensingate circles, and would place her on a pinnacle in St. Chuddocks, where hardly any one read French, and assuredly no one had heard of L’Abreuvoir interdit.|$|R
40|$|Received Smith's {{letter from}} Holkham, [Norfolk, home of Sir Thomas William Coke]. Supposes Smith {{occupied}} "by the business which has so long disgraced {{the house of}} Lords, but more so everyone {{of those who have}} brought such foul matters before them" [probably "trial" of Queen Caroline], his opinion same as Lord Harewood's speech in today's paper and regardless of whatever party is more in the wrong the business in hand is "insanity & is more likely to shake the government than the attempts of the Radicals". Prince Leopold seems to have had "some tiff" with the King [George III (1738 - 1820) ] lately. His son and daughter-in-law have been placing single trees and shrubs on the lawn "so zealously that the Lady carries various articles, & even digs". His son has renounced foxhunting. His own health generally good but debility and rheumatism leave him helpless at hedges and when shooting has to be pulled through. His <b>garden</b> thriving: had <b>asparagus</b> on the 3 rd and peas today, the former raised in a "pigeon holed frame" invented by McPhail which prevents manure vapours affecting the bed so the produce is sweeter. Disapproves of [Thomas] A[ndrew] Knight's "filthy practice of drenching [his] fig, & his pines, with a mixture of piegons' dung & water the colour of Porter" to guarantee multiple crops from his fig tree, received a letter reporting nine crops in fifteen months. Too few woodcocks this season to prove his theory that only males come over in first flight; encloses exterior quill feathers [not extant] of the male as example, females have a white line running most of the way from the quill to the extremity, small ink sketch illustrating this. Copying and "tearing out likenesses in paper"; there is much chance in tracing them, encloses example of "old Mrs Warburton, well known in the society at York 30 or 40 years ago", requests its return. Just requested specimen of 'Menziesia caerulea' from Scotland and will attempt to procure 'Menziesia polifolia' through his sister, Lady Roche, in Dublin...|$|R
