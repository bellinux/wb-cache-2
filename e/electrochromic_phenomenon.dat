40|$|V 20 s etc.) have {{recently}} received much attention owing to their interesting electrical, optical and electrochromic properties [1]. The <b>electrochromic</b> <b>phenomenon</b> {{is based on}} the ability of certain materials to change their light-absorbing properties while under the influence of an applied electrical field. This phenomenon is particularly interesting in view of its application in display and "smart win-dow " devices [1]. Among these oxides, WO 3 has attracted the most attention. However, recent work seems to indicate that the electrochromic response of the molybdenum oxide is also aesthetically superior to other electrochromic materials because it absorbs light more uniformly and appears more neutral in color [2]. Transition metal oxides thin films have been prepared by various methods including thermal or electron beam evaporation, RF sputtering [3, 4]; chemical vapor deposition, spray, sol-gel and spin coating [5 - 8]; and recently for WO 3, oxidation of tungsten metal [9] and electro-deposition from tungsten-hydrogen peroxide solu-tion [10]. In this communication, we report the first preparation of molybdenum oxide thin films by electrodeposition and the effect of the heat treat-ment on their electrochromic properties. The electrochemical cell used was a stan-dard three-electrode system. Indium tin oxide (ITO) conducting glass (Applied Films, 20 ~/a) and plati-num foil were used as working and counter electro-des, and Ag/AgCI(3. 8 M KCI) as a reference elec-trode. A PAR Model 372 potentiostat and an HP Model 7005 B X-Y plotter were used for electro-chemical measurements. The spectroelectrochemi-stry studies were carried out with a Philips Model PU 8620 spectrometer. The deposition solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of molybdenum foil in 6 ml of hydrogen peroxide (30 %). When the metal wa...|$|E
40|$|<b>Electrochromic</b> <b>phenomena</b> {{accompanying}} the ferroelectric domain inversion in congruent RuO 2 -doped z-cut LiNbO 3 crystals {{at room temperature}} are observed in experiments. During the electric poling process, the electrochromism accompanies the ferroelectric domain inversion simultaneously in the same poled area. The electrochromism is completely reversible when the domain is inverted from the reverse direction. The influences of electric field and annealing conditions on domain inversion and electrochromism are also discussed. We propose the reasonable assumption that charge redistribution within the crystal structure caused by domain inversion is the source for electrochemically oxidation and reduction of Ru ion to produce the electrochromic effect.

40|$|The {{manifestation of}} <b>electrochromic</b> <b>phenomena</b> makes Prussian blue (PB) thin films very attractive, {{especially}} because they exhibit four-color polyelectrochromicity. In this work PB thin films were prepared by simple and low cost shemical deposition method. The films were deposited onto fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates. An electrochromic test device (ECTD) was constructed by using these films as working electrodes, and FTO coated glass as an opposite electrode {{in aqueous solution}} of 1 mol/dm 3 KCl as supporting electrolyte. The electrochemical properties of the films were characterized by cyclic voltammetry. The obtained films exhibited electrochromism, changing color from deep blue in as deposited state into green, and back to blue and colorless. Visible transmittance spectra of PB films were studied in-situ in as deposited, colored and bleached states. From those spectra, contrast ratio (CR) and the optical band gaps Eg were evaluated. The dependence of the optical density (OD) on charge density was examined and the coloration efficiency (CE) was calculated to be 149. 8 cm 2 C- 1. The time response during the film switching between transparent and blue states was also examined...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, imaging {{membrane}} potential {{has become a}} fruitful approach to study neural circuits, especially in invertebrate preparations with large, resilient neurons. At the same time, particularly in mammalian preparations, voltage imaging methods suffer from poor signal to noise and secondary side effects, and they fall short of providing single-cell resolution when imaging of the activity of neuronal populations. As an introduction to these techniques, we briefly review different voltage imaging methods (including organic fluorophores, SHG chromophores, genetic indicators, hybrid, nanoparticles and intrinsic approaches), and illustrate some of their applications to neuronal biophysics and mammalian circuit analysis. We discuss their mechanisms of voltage sensitivity, from reorientation, <b>electrochromic</b> or electro-optical <b>phenomena,</b> to interaction among chromophores or membrane scattering, and highlight their advantages and shortcomings, commenting on the outlook for development of novel voltage imaging methods...|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{materials}} science, band structure engineering has become important since the bandgap {{is one of the}} most important factors controlling physical properties. Especially, the search for polymers that possess narrow bandgaps is a current tonic because such polymers are expected to be promising candidates for intrinsic organic conductors and nonlinear optical devices. Therefore, it is important to create new types of narrow-bandgap polymers and to examine the factors controlling bandgaps for further understanding the narrow-bandgap systems. From these viewpoints, in Chapter 1, the discovery of narrow-bandgap polymers and the pathway of the research are overlooked and connected to a new molecular design. By the analysis of factors controlling bandgaps, two molecular designs were extracted. One is the copolymerization of aromatic and o-quinoid units. Another is the alternation of strong electron-donating and electron-accepting moieties. On the basis of them, periodic copolymers consisted of aromatic-donor (A: thiophene and N-methylpyrrole) and ο-quinoid-acceptor (Q: thieno[3, 4 -b]pyrazine, quinoxaline, 2, 1, 3 -benzothiadiazole, [1, 2, 5]thiadiazolo[3, 4 -g]quinoxaline, benzo[1, 2 -c; 4, 5 -c 2 ̆ 7]bis[1, 2, 5]-thiadiazole, pyrazino[2, 3 -g]quinoxaline, and pyrazino[2, 3 -b]quinoxaline) segments were planned to obtain new narrow bandgap systems. A series of triheterocyclic monomers (A-Q-A) which were expected to polymerize by electrochemical oxidative coupling was designed to investigate the structure-property relationship. The o-quinoid-acceptor heterocycles have no hydrogen atoms at peripheral positions, that would relieve the steric repulsion between adjacent segments. Chapter 2 deals with preparation and properties of the series of triheterocyclic monomers. Since the properties of polymers are considered to correlate straightforwardly to those of monomers, the properties of monomers were examined in detail. The monomers were synthesized through the coupling reaction of dihalo-substituted compounds with stannane compounds in the presence of a Pd(II) catalyst. To estimate the properties of monomers roughly and to facilitate discussion later, MO calculations of each segment were carried out by the MNDO-PM 3 method. The results indicated that the HOMO level of N-methylpyrrole is higher than that of thiophene, and that the LUMO energies of ο-quinoid-acceptor heterocycles range widely. Electronic spectra of the monomers with thiophene as aromatic-donor unit exhibited a trend that the monomer with ο-quinoid-acceptor unit whose LUMO level is lower has a longer absorption maximum. On the other hand, the absorption bands of the monomers containing N-methylpyrrole displayed small blue shifts compared with the corresponding thiophene analogs against the speculation based on the MO calculations. To solve this problem, X-ray analysis of some monomers with thiophene and conformational analysis of the other monomers were performed. They revealed that the molecules containing thiophene have almost coplanar conformations, while the molecules containing N-methylpyrrole have torsional geometries. It was expected that the nonplanar conformations cause the reduction of effective delocalization. Cyclic voltammetry measurements of the monomers displayed an irreversible oxidation wave and a reversible or quasi-reversible reduction wave, indicating amphoteric redox properties. The difference between anodic and cathodic peak potentials depended on the LUMO levels of o-quinoid-acceptor heterocycles. Chapter 3 describes syntheses and properties of the variety of the corresponding polymers. Electrochemical polymerization of the monomers stated above on Pt and ITO electrodes by a repetitive potential cycling method was attempted. All the cyclic voltammograms but one showed the outlooks indicating the smooth growth of polymers deposited on an electrode over a period of polymerization. The resulting polymers were relatively stable under ordinary conditions but insoluble to all the organic solvents even when longer alkyl chains were introduced. Cyclic voltammograms of the polymers on a Pt disk electrode needed to be measured under certain strict conditions to gain clear reproducible voltammograms. Most of the polymers containing thiophene units showed both p- and n- doping processes, indicating amphoteric redox properties similarly to the monomers. The p-doping wave was broad and irreversible, while the n-doping wave was quasi-reversible (and sharp in the case of the polymers without alkyl substituents). On the other hand, the polymers with N-methylpyrrole units hardly showed n-doping probably because the special conformations disturbed the tonic transport. Some polymers exhibited characteristic waves possibly due to the charge trapping. The small difference between the onset potentials of p- and n-doping, which corresponds to the bandgap in the conversion of V into eV, suggested that the resulting polymers had narrow bandgaps. Electronic spectra of the polymers on an ITO-coated glass electrode were measured ex situ under control of potentials. From the onset of the absorbance of neutral polymers, optical bandgaps were estimated. As oxidized electrochemically, many polymers displayed characteristic <b>electrochromic</b> <b>phenomena.</b> The bandgaps were a range of 0. 5 to 1. 8 eV. The value of 0. 5 eV is one of the narrowest bandgaps reported so far. Consequently, it was elucidated that the molecular design adopted in this thesis produced the new narrow-bandgap system effectively and that the structural modification tuned the bandgaps subtly...|$|R
