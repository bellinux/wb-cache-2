5|$|A {{possible}} transitional form of microorganism {{between a}} prokaryote and a <b>eukaryote</b> {{was discovered in}} 2012 by Japanese scientists. Parakaryon myojinensis is a unique microorganism larger than a typical prokaryote, but with nuclear material enclosed in a membrane as in a <b>eukaryote,</b> {{and the presence of}} endosymbionts. This is seen to be the first plausible evolutionary form of microorganism, showing a stage of development from the prokaryote to the <b>eukaryote.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{superphylum}} – TACK – {{has been}} proposed that includes the Thaumarchaeota, Aigarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, and Korarchaeota. This superphylum {{may be related to}} the origin of eukaryotes. More recently, the superphylum Asgard has been named and proposed to be more closely related to the original <b>eukaryote</b> and a sister group to TACK.|$|E
50|$|This {{controversy}} was {{summarized in}} 2005:There {{is no consensus}} among biologists concerning {{the position of the}} <b>eukaryotes</b> in the overall scheme of cell evolution. Current opinions on the origin and position of <b>eukaryotes</b> span a broad spectrum including the views that <b>eukaryotes</b> arose first in evolution and that prokaryotes descend from them, that <b>eukaryotes</b> arose contemporaneously with eubacteria and archeabacteria and hence represent a primary line of descent of equal age and rank as the prokaryotes, that <b>eukaryotes</b> arose through a symbiotic event entailing an endosymbiotic origin of the nucleus, that <b>eukaryotes</b> arose without endosymbiosis, and that <b>eukaryotes</b> arose through a symbiotic event entailing a simultaneous endosymbiotic origin of the flagellum and the nucleus, in addition to many other models, which have been reviewed and summarized elsewhere.The oldest known fossilized prokaryotes were laid down approximately 3.5 billion years ago, only about 1 billion years after the formation of the Earth's crust. <b>Eukaryotes</b> only appear in the fossil record later, and may have formed from endosymbiosis of multiple prokaryote ancestors. The oldest known fossil <b>eukaryotes</b> are about 1.7 billion years old. However, some genetic evidence suggests <b>eukaryotes</b> appeared as early as 3 billion years ago.|$|R

50|$|These {{findings}} on sexuality in Giardia, above, {{have important implications}} for understanding the origin of sexual reproduction in <b>eukaryotes.</b> Even though sexual reproduction is widespread among extant <b>eukaryotes,</b> it seemed unlikely, until recently, that sex is a primordial and fundamental feature of <b>eukaryotes.</b> A probable reason for the view that sex may not be fundamental to <b>eukaryotes</b> was that sexual reproduction previously appeared to be lacking in certain human pathogenic single-celled <b>eukaryotes</b> (e.g. Giardia) that diverged from early ancestors in the eukaryotic lineage.|$|R
5|$|The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{has been}} an {{important}} model organism in modern cell biology for much of the twentieth century, {{and is one of the}} most thoroughly researched eukaryotic microorganisms. It was the first <b>eukaryote</b> whose genome was sequenced. In the twentyfirst century, the filamentous mould Aspergillus has been adopted for genome studies.|$|E
5|$|Palaeobotanists study ancient {{plants in}} the fossil record to provide {{information}} about the evolutionary history of plants. Cyanobacteria, the first oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms on Earth, are thought to have given rise to the ancestor of plants by entering into an endosymbiotic relationship with an early <b>eukaryote,</b> ultimately becoming the chloroplasts in plant cells. The new photosynthetic plants (along with their algal relatives) accelerated the rise in atmospheric oxygen started by the cyanobacteria, changing the ancient oxygen-free, reducing, atmosphere to one in which free oxygen has been abundant for more than 2 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Serpins are {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} and largest superfamily of protease inhibitors. They were initially believed to be restricted to <b>eukaryote</b> organisms, but have since been found in bacteria, archaea and some viruses. It remains unclear whether prokaryote genes are the descendants of an ancestral prokaryotic serpin or the product of horizontal gene transfer from eukaryotes. Most intracellular serpins belong to a single phylogenetic clade, whether they come from plants or animals, indicating that the intracellular and extracellular serpins may have diverged before the plants and animals. Exceptions include the intracellular heat shock serpin HSP47, which is a chaperone essential for proper folding of collagen, and cycles between the cis-Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
50|$|The protein {{sequences}} of NAGS between prokaryotes, lower <b>eukaryotes</b> and higher <b>eukaryotes</b> {{have shown a}} remarkable lack of similarity. Sequence identity between prokaryotic and eukaryotic NAGS is largely <30%, while sequence identity between lower and higher <b>eukaryotes</b> is ~20%.|$|R
5000|$|Protists are a {{large group}} of diverse {{eukaryotic}} microorganisms, mainly unicellular animals and plants, that do not form tissues. <b>Eukaryotes</b> emerged in evolution more than 1.5 billion years ago. [...] The earliest <b>eukaryotes</b> were likely protists. Mating and sexual reproduction are widespread among extant <b>eukaryotes.</b> Based on a phylogenetic analysis, Dacks and Roger proposed that facultative sex was present in the common ancestor of all <b>eukaryotes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Vertical {{transmission}} of heritable material, {{a cornerstone of}} the Darwinian theory of evolution, is inadequate to describe the evolution of <b>eukaryotes,</b> particularly microbial <b>eukaryotes.</b> This is because eukaryotic cells and eukaryotic genomes are chimeric, having evolved {{through a combination of}} vertical (parent to offspring) and lateral (trans-species) transmission. Observations on widespread chimerism in <b>eukaryotes</b> have led to new and revised hypothesis for the origin and diversification of <b>eukaryotes</b> that provide specific predictions on the tempo (early vs continuous transfers) and mode (nature of donor and recipient lineages) of lateral gene transfers (LGTs). Analyses of available data indicate that LGTs in <b>eukaryotes</b> largely fall into two categories: (1) LGTs from organelles to the nucleus, only a few of which appear to have occurred {{at the time of the}} origin of <b>eukaryotes,</b> and (2) anomalous LGTs involving diverse donor and recipient lineages. Further testing of hypotheses on the origin and diversification of <b>eukaryotes</b> will require complete genome sequences from a number of diverse <b>eukaryotes</b> and prokaryotes combined with sequences of targeted genes from a broad phylogenetic sample...|$|R
5|$|The {{origin of}} the endomembrane system {{is linked to the}} origin of eukaryotes {{themselves}} and the origin of eukaryoties to the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria. Many models have been put forward to explain the {{origin of the}} endomembrane system (reviewed in). The most recent concept suggests that the endomembrane system evolved from outer membrane vesicles the endosymbiotic mitochondrion secreted. This OMV-based model for the origin of the endomembrane system is currently the one that requires the least amount of novel inventions at <b>eukaryote</b> origin and explains the many connections of mitochondria with other compartments of the cell.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{hypotheses}} {{about the origin}} of mitochondria: endosymbiotic and autogenous. The endosymbiotic hypothesis suggests that mitochondria were originally prokaryotic cells, capable of implementing oxidative mechanisms that were not possible for eukaryotic cells; they became endosymbionts living inside the <b>eukaryote.</b> In the autogenous hypothesis, mitochondria were born by splitting off a portion of DNA from the nucleus of the eukaryotic cell at the time of divergence with the prokaryotes; this DNA portion would have been enclosed by membranes, which could not be crossed by proteins. Since mitochondria have many features in common with bacteria, the endosymbiotic hypothesis is more widely accepted.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of a}} {{synthesized}} protein can {{be measured}} {{by the number of}} amino acids it contains and by its total molecular mass, which is normally reported in units of daltons (synonymous with atomic mass units), or the derivative unit kilodalton (kDa). The average size of protein increases from Archaea, Bacteria to <b>Eukaryote</b> (283, 311, 438 residues and 31, 34, 49 kDa respecitvely) due bigger number of protein domains constituting proteins in higher organisms. For instance, yeast proteins are on average 466 amino acids long and 53 kDa in mass. The largest known proteins are the titins, a component of the muscle sarcomere, with a molecular mass of almost 3,000 kDa and a total length of almost 27,000 amino acids.|$|E
50|$|Despite these {{environmental}} constraints, <b>eukaryotes</b> developed multicellularity {{during the}} Boring Billion {{and a major}} diversification of <b>eukaryotes</b> occurred at the supergroup level between 1.9 and 0.75 Ga. Key biological innovations such as cell differentiation, sexual reproduction, and eukaryotic photosynthesis separated <b>eukaryotes</b> into animals, algae, and fungi.|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecent {{studies have}} {{provided}} evidence for gene transfers from prokaryotes to <b>eukaryotes</b> and between <b>eukaryotes.</b> The mechanisms and frequencies of these transfers remain {{the subject of}} speculation, but the findings provide ample reason to seriously consider interspecies gene transfer as an important evolutionary process in <b>eukaryotes...</b>|$|R
5000|$|As {{early as}} 2010, the major {{competitor}} {{to the three}} domains scenario for the origin of <b>eukaryotes</b> was the [...] "two domains" [...] (2D) scenario, in which <b>eukaryotes</b> emerged from within the archaea. The discovery of a major group within the Archaea, Lokiarchaeota, to which <b>eukaryotes</b> are more genetically similar than to other archaeans, is {{not consistent with the}} Neomura hypothesis. Instead, it supports the hypothesis that <b>eukaryotes</b> emerged from within one group of archaeans: ...|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} of <b>eukaryote</b> microorganisms {{was a major}} bottleneck to higher evolution on Earth. Including <b>eukaryote</b> microorganisms in the payload can bypass this barrier. Multicellular organisms are even more desirable, but being much heavier than bacteria, fewer can be sent. Hardy tardigrades (water-bears) may be suitable but they are similar to arthropods and would lead to insects. The body-plan of rotifers could lead to higher animals, if the rotifers can be hardened to survive interstellar transit.|$|E

500|$|Unicellular <b>eukaryotes</b> {{consist of}} a single cell {{throughout}} their life cycle. [...] This qualification is significant since most multicellular <b>eukaryotes</b> {{consist of a}} single cell called a zygote only {{at the beginning of}} their life cycles. Microbial <b>eukaryotes</b> can be either haploid or diploid, and some organisms have multiple cell nuclei.|$|R
5000|$|The nuclear DNA {{and genetic}} {{machinery}} of <b>eukaryotes</b> is {{more similar to}} Archaea than Bacteria, leading to a controversial suggestion that <b>eukaryotes</b> should be grouped with Archaea in the clade Neomura. In other respects, such as membrane composition, <b>eukaryotes</b> are similar to Bacteria. Three main explanations for this have been proposed: ...|$|R
25|$|Cell {{division}} {{in a typical}} <b>eukaryote</b> finishes with the generation of a final cytoplasmic bridge between the two daughter cells termed the midbody. This structure is built of microtubules that originally made up part of the mitotic spindle.|$|E
25|$|All {{secondary}} chloroplasts {{come from}} {{green and red}} algae—no secondary chloroplasts from glaucophytes have been observed, probably because glaucophytes are relatively rare in nature, making them {{less likely to have}} been taken up by another <b>eukaryote.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chloroplasts are {{believed}} to have arisen after mitochondria, since all eukaryotes contain mitochondria, but not all have chloroplasts. This is called serial endosymbiosis—an early <b>eukaryote</b> engulfing the mitochondrion ancestor, and some descendants of it then engulfing the chloroplast ancestor, creating a cell with both chloroplasts and mitochondria.|$|E

2500|$|The {{lengths of}} Okazaki {{fragments}} in prokaryotes and <b>eukaryotes</b> are different as well. [...] Prokaryotes have Okazaki fragments that are quite longer {{than those of}} <b>eukaryotes.</b> [...] <b>Eukaryotes</b> typically have Okazaki fragments that are 100 to 200 nucleotides long, whereas prokaryotic E. coli can be 2,000 nucleotides long. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown.|$|R
25|$|With one {{exception}} (the amoeboid Paulinella chromatophora), all chloroplasts can probably {{be traced back}} to a single endosymbiotic event, when a cyanobacterium was engulfed by the <b>eukaryote.</b> Despite this, chloroplasts can be found in an extremely wide set of organisms, some not even directly related to each other—a consequence of many secondary and even tertiary endosymbiotic events.|$|E
25|$|While the {{evolution}} of sex dates to the prokaryote or early <b>eukaryote</b> stage, the origin of chromosomal sex determination may have been fairly early in eukaryotes (see Evolution of anisogamy). The ZW sex-determination system is shared by birds, some fish and some crustaceans. XY sex determination is used by most mammals, but also some insects, and plants (Silene latifolia). X0 sex-determination is found in certain insects.|$|E
25|$|A winter annual with a {{relatively}} short life cycle, A. thaliana is a popular model organism in plant biology and genetics. For a complex multicellular <b>eukaryote,</b> A. thaliana has {{a relatively}} small genome of approximately 135 megabase pairs (Mbp). It was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, and is a popular tool for understanding the molecular biology of many plant traits, including flower development and light sensing.|$|E
50|$|Some {{differences}} exist between <b>eukaryotes</b> and prokaryotes. The conversion of D-threo-isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate is catalyzed in <b>eukaryotes</b> by the NAD+-dependent EC 1.1.1.41, while prokaryotes employ the NADP+-dependent EC 1.1.1.42. Similarly, {{the conversion of}} (S)-malate to oxaloacetate is catalyzed in <b>eukaryotes</b> by the NAD+-dependent EC 1.1.1.37, while most prokaryotes utilize a quinone-dependent enzyme, EC 1.1.5.4.|$|R
50|$|Cytoskeletal {{proteins}} {{are usually}} associated with cell shape, DNA segregation and cell division in prokaryotes and <b>eukaryotes.</b> Which proteins fulfill which task is very different. For example, DNA segregation in all <b>eukaryotes</b> happens through use of tubulin, but in prokaryotes either WACA proteins, actin-like or tubulin-like proteins can be used. Cell division is mediated in <b>eukaryotes</b> by actin, but in prokaryotes usually by tubulin-like (often FtsZ-ring) proteins and sometimes (Crenarchaeota) ESCRT-III, which in <b>eukaryotes</b> still has {{a role in the}} last step of division.|$|R
50|$|The {{origin and}} {{function}} of meiosis are fundamental to understanding the evolution of sexual reproduction in <b>Eukaryotes.</b> There is no current consensus among biologists on the questions of how sex in <b>Eukaryotes</b> arose in evolution, what basic function sexual reproduction serves, and why it is maintained, given the basic two-fold cost of sex. It is clear that it evolved over 1.2 billion years ago, and that almost all species which are descendents of the original sexually reproducing species are still sexual reproducers, including plants, fungi, and animals.Meiosis is a key event of the sexual cycle in <b>Eukaryotes.</b> It is {{the stage of the}} life cycle when a cell gives rise to two haploid cells (gametes) each having half as many chromosomes. Two such haploid gametes, arising from different individual organisms, fuse by the process of fertilization, thus completing the sexual cycle.Meiosis is ubiquitous among <b>eukaryotes.</b> It occurs in single-celled organisms such as yeast, as well as in multicellular organisms, such as humans. <b>Eukaryotes</b> arose from prokaryotes more than 2.2 billion years ago and the earliest <b>eukaryotes</b> were likely single-celled organisms. To understand sex in <b>eukaryotes,</b> it is necessary to understand (1) how meiosis arose in single celled <b>eukaryotes,</b> and (2) the function of meiosis.|$|R
