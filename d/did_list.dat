When national polls <b>did</b> <b>list</b> Hunter, he consistently got three percent or less support among Republicans.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, a 2015 {{meta-analysis}} {{revealed that}} {{the positive effects of}} CBT on depression have been declining since 1977. The overall results showed two different declines in effect sizes: 1) an overall decline between 1977 and 2014, and 2) a steeper decline between 1995 and 2014. Additional sub-analysis revealed that CBT studies where therapists in the test group were instructed to adhere to the Beck CBT manual had a steeper decline in effect sizes since 1977 than studies where therapists in the test group were instructed to use CBT without a manual. The authors reported that they were unsure why the effects were declining but <b>did</b> <b>list</b> inadequate therapist training, failure to adhere to a manual, lack of therapist experience, and patients' hope and faith in its efficacy waning as potential reasons. The authors did mention that the current study was limited to depressive disorders only.|$|E

2500|$|Guinness World Records {{has called}} the CN Tower [...] "the world's tallest {{self-supporting}} tower" [...] and [...] "the world's tallest free-standing tower". [...] Although Guinness <b>did</b> <b>list</b> this description of the CN Tower under the heading [...] "tallest building" [...] at least once, it has also listed it under [...] "tallest tower", omitting it from its list of [...] "tallest buildings." [...] In 1996, Guinness changed the tower's classification to [...] "World's Tallest Building and Freestanding Structure". Emporis and the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat both listed the CN Tower as the world's tallest free-standing structure on land, and specifically state that the CN Tower is not a true building, thereby awarding the title of world's tallest building to Taipei 101, which is [...] shorter than the CN Tower.

[...] The Court then applied the Daubert standard to a decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal. [...] The Quebec Court had held that greater liberality should be applied by the Court in receiving pro-defense scientific evidence in a criminal case.

2500|$|The Israel Central Bureau of Statistics classifies [...] "Israelis {{who left}} the country" [...] as Israelis who lived outside Israel {{for more than one}} year continuously, but who prior to that year lived in Israel for at least 90 days continuously, thus {{distinguishing}} between those {{who left the}} state and those who left in the past and returned for a short visit. In the 1950s and 1960s, indeed until the early 1970s, the Statistical Abstract published by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics <b>did</b> <b>list</b> emigration figures. Subsequently the practice was suspended, this avoided conflict with other Israeli government entities who cited much larger numbers of emigrants than the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics published estimates. Emigration estimates can still be inferred from current population projections by the CBS: Between the years 1990 to 2005 emigration assumptions from Israel by the CBS averaged 14,000 people per year. 1993, 1995 and 2001–2002 saw relatively high levels of emigration. The rate of the emigrants from Israel decreased during those years from 3 per thousand to 1 per thousand {{as a result of an}} increase in total Israeli population. This total estimate includes both the Israeli Arab emigrants and Israeli Jews who may have died while abroad. The CBS analyzed the border control data and computed a [...] "gross balance" [...] of 581,000 Israelis living abroad during the period 1948–1992. In other words, there were 581,000 more exits from Israel than re-entries on the part of Israeli residents (i.e., persons living in Israel whether native-born or born elsewhere). About half of the persons leaving Israel named the United States as their destination. Assuming that they stayed in the United States, and that no other Israelis came to the United States via other countries, the [...] "gross balance" [...] of Israelis residing in the United States would be 290,500. Zvi Eisenbach, working from Israeli data, has calculated that about 74 percent of American Israelis are Jews. Thus, the gross balance of Israeli Jews in the United States over the period 1948–1992 is adjusted down to 216,000. Gold and Phillips subtracted from this number 25,000 persons who would have died, leaving 265,500. Since the gross balance subtracts reentrances to Israel from exits out of Israel, Gold and Phillips subtracted 18,400 more persons who may be assumed to have returned to Israel in 1993 (the number that re-entered Israel in 1992), for an adjusted gross balance of 172,848 Jewish Israelis living in the United States.|$|E
