25|$|Eakins' {{attitude}} toward realism in painting, and {{his desire to}} explore the heart of American life proved influential. He taught hundreds of students, among them his future wife Susan Macdowell, African-American painter Henry Ossawa Tanner, and Thomas Anshutz, who taught, in turn, Robert Henri, George Luks, John Sloan, and Everett Shinn, future members of the Ashcan School, and other realists and artistic heirs to Eakins' philosophy. Though <b>his</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a household name, and though during his lifetime Eakins struggled {{to make a living}} from his work, today he is {{regarded as one of the}} most important American artists of any period.|$|E
2500|$|According to some critics, Sparks was {{inspired}} by the 1992 best-selling novel The Bridges of Madison County in writing Nights in Rodanthe. The Bridges of Madison County has a few similarities to Nights in Rodanthe: the characters are roughly of the same age and their relationships had ended. Sparks, said he was more guided by his novel The Notebook than The Bridges. He explained that the latter is a story of adultery while <b>his</b> <b>is</b> <b>not.</b> The main male character of The Bridges was a loner without children, while Paul has children. In his official website, Sparks writes, [...] "The list [...] could go on and on, but I think you get the point." ...|$|E
2500|$|Variety {{called it}} [...] "ndoubtedly {{the best thing}} Vitaphone has ever put on the screen... {{abundant}} power and appeal." [...] Richard Watts, Jr. of the New York Herald Tribune called it a [...] "pleasantly sentimental orgy dealing with a struggle between religion and art.... <b>his</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> essentially a motion picture, but rather a chance to capture for comparative immortality the sight and sound of a great performer." [...] The Exhibitors Heralds take was virtually identical: [...] "scarcely a motion picture. It should be more properly labeled an enlarged Vitaphone record of Al Jolson in half a dozen songs." [...] The film received favorable reviews in both the Jewish press and in African American newspapers such as the Baltimore Afro-American, the New York Amsterdam News, and the Pittsburgh Courier. The headline of the Los Angeles Times review told a somewhat different story: [...] "'Jazz Singer' Scores a Hit—Vitaphone and Al Jolson Responsible, Picture Itself Second Rate." [...] Photoplay dismissed Jolson as [...] "no movie actor. Without his Broadway reputation he wouldn't rate as a minor player." ...|$|E

2500|$|Zelena and Hook {{are both}} {{chained to the}} wall in Emma’s basement, as Zelena thinks Emma is {{preparing}} a spell to take her magic. Emma says she’s giving her dark magic to Zelena. Hook asks why keep it a secret, and {{she says that she}} did this because she knew he would want to stop her. She says the dark magic must be put into a vessel, and then Emma will cut her down. Emma says that’s why she needed the baby out. She reminds him that Zelena killed Marian and Neal, but Hook says that it’s still [...] "cold-blooded murder." [...] Hook says Merlin must have a better solution, but she says that he can’t help them anymore. Hook asks what happened to Merlin, and he asks her again why she’s really doing this. Mary asks David and Regina how Emma can use Zelena to end dark magic, but they can't figure it out. Regina says no one hurts her sister except for her and tells them she’s going to show Emma what dark magic is really like. Mary Margaret and David argue with Regina over going to war with Emma. Regina says Emma gave her the dagger because they knew {{she was the only one}} who could act. Emma comes out and says when she’s done with Zelena, they will all be better off. Regina says that <b>his</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> right, but Emma says she knows Regina will be happier when Zelena is gone. Emma uses Excalibur to freeze them, while putting up a magic barrier around the house.|$|E

"Mr. Burton," [...] the {{professor}} interposed, [...] "I beg {{that you will}} not misunderstand Mr. Bomford. <b>His</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a militant disbelief, it is simply a case of suspended judgment.

6000|$|... "Nevertheless, {{there is}} no harm in trying. I have an idea that this malady of <b>his</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{permanent}} and incurable. The very violence with which the germ of loquacity has attacked him gives me hope. You must remember that before this seizure he was rather a noticeably silent man. Sometimes I {{think that it is}} just Nature's way of restoring the average, and that soon the fever may burn itself out. Or it may be that a sudden shock ... At any rate, have courage." ...|$|E
60|$|This gallantry of <b>his</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> perhaps, seen to best {{advantage}} in the affair of Charlotte de Montmorency To begin with he was, as I have said, in his fifty-sixth year, an age at which it is difficult, without being ridiculous, to unbridle a passion for a girl of twenty. Unfortunately for him, Charlotte {{does not appear to}} have found him so. On the contrary, her lovely, empty head was so turned by the flattery of his addresses, that she came to reciprocate the passion she inspired.|$|E
60|$|But Gray <b>was</b> <b>not</b> esteemed a prophet. <b>His</b> {{suggestions}} <b>were</b> <b>not</b> adopted nor <b>his</b> plans acted on, though unquestionably {{his wisdom}} and energy gave {{an impulse to}} railway development, {{of which we are}} reaping the benefit to-day. <b>His</b> labours <b>were</b> <b>not</b> in vain.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} from his book; <b>his</b> eyes <b>were</b> <b>not</b> cold or malevolent, <b>his</b> mouth <b>was</b> <b>not</b> cynical; he <b>was</b> ready and willing to hear what I might have to say: <b>his</b> spirit <b>was</b> of vintage too mellow and generous to sour in one thunder-clap.|$|R
60|$|His {{voice trailed}} off. He <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a very {{intelligent}} young man, but even {{he could see that}} <b>his</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a position where righteous indignation could be assumed with any solid chance of success. As a substitute he tried pathos.|$|R
6000|$|Forester {{then called}} upon {{each of the}} boys, in succession, to give his opinion on the point. Marco {{was in favor of}} going down the river, but all the rest, though they said that they should like to go very much, thought it would not answer, as it would be almost {{impossible}} to get the boat up again over the rips. After the consultation was concluded, Forester said, [...] "Well, boys, you have all given wise opinions except Marco, and <b>his</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> wise. Now we'll go aboard the boat." ...|$|E
6000|$|Shakspeare {{is of no}} age. It is idle to {{endeavour}} to support his phrases by quotations from Ben Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, &c. His language is entirely his own, and the younger dramatists imitated him. The construction of Shakspeare's sentences, whether in verse or prose, is the necessary and homogeneous vehicle of his peculiar manner of thinking. <b>His</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{the style of the}} age. More particularly, Shakspeare's blank verse is an absolutely new creation. Read Daniel[1]--the admirable Daniel--in his [...] "Civil Wars," [...] and [...] "Triumphs of Hymen." ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{impossible}} to argue against a critic's subjective {{sense of what is}} likely. Possibly that sense is born of the feeling that the Cretan linear script, for example, or the Cyprian syllabary, looks very odd and outlandish. The critic's imagination boggles at the idea of an epic written in such scripts. In that case <b>his</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the scientific imagination; he is checked merely by the unfamiliar. Or his sense of unlikelihood may be a subconscious survival of Wolf's opinion, formed by him {{at a time when the}} existence of the many scripts of the old world was unknown.|$|E

Therefore, this {{faith is}} deceitful, even such as will leave thee under wrath, {{in the day}} of God Almighty; for true {{justifying}} faith puts the soul, as sensible of its lost condition by the law, upon flying for refuge unto Christ's righteousness, which righteousness of <b>His</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an act of grace, by which He maketh, for justification, thy obedience accepted with God; but His personal obedience to the law, in doing and suffering for us what that required at our hands; this righteousness, I say, true faith accepteth; under the skirt of which, the soul being shrouded, and by it presented as spotless before God, it is accepted, and acquit from condemnation.[292] ...|$|E

By dinner time he would be calm, the opera would soothe him still more, and {{by the time it was}} over he would be quite ready to take Mademoiselle Somebody out to supper. With the first glass of champagne his sorrow would be drowned for ever. If any wound remained at all, it would be the wound to his vanity." ...|$|E
