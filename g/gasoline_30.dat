40|$|Although {{most people}} are thought to receive their highest acute {{exposures}} to gasoline while refueling, relatively little is actually known about personal, nonoccupational exposures to gasoline during refueling activities. This {{study was designed to}} measure exposures {{associated with the use of}} an oxygenated fuel under cold conditions in Fairbanks, Alaska. We compared concentrations of gasoline components in the blood and in the personal breathing zone (PBZ) of people who pumped regular unleaded gasoline (referred to as regular gasoline) with concentrations in the blood of those who pumped an oxygenated fuel that was 10 % ethanol (E- 10). A subset of participants in a wintertime engine performance study provided blood samples before and after pumping <b>gasoline</b> (<b>30</b> using regular gasoline and 30 using E- 10). The biological and environmental samples were analyzed for selected aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in gasoline (benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, m-/p-xylene, and o-xylene); the biological samples were also analyzed for three chemicals not found in gasoline (1, 4 -dichlorobenzene, chloroform, and styrene). People in our study had significantly higher levels of gasoline components in their blood after pumping gasoline than they had before pumping gasoline. The changes in VOC levels in blood were similar whether the individuals pumped regular gasoline or the E- 10 blend. The analysis of PBZ samples indicated that there were also measurable levels of gasoline components in the air during refueling. The VOC levels in PBZ air were similar for the two groups. In this study, we demonstrate that people are briefly exposed to low (ppm and sub-ppm) levels of known carcinogens and other potentially toxic compounds while pumping gasoline, regardless of the type of gasoline used...|$|E
40|$|Liquefied {{petroleum}} gas (LPG) is increasingly being examined {{as an alternative}} to gasoline use in automobiles as interest grows in reducing air pollutant emissions. In this study, emissions of regulated (CO, THC, NO(x)) and unregulated air pollutants, including CO(2), particulate matter (PM), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and BTEX (acronym for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene), were measured before and after conversion of nine gasoline-powered automobiles to LPG/ gasoline dual-fuel retrofits. The tests were conducted on a standard chassis dynamometer in accordance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency FTP- 75 test procedure, with the exception that all tests were conducted under hot-start driving conditions. The influences of LPG on air pollutant emission levels and carcinogenic potency were investigated and compared with gasoline. The results showed average emission factors of 0. 14 g/km, 0. 33 mg/km, 0. 09 g/km, 0. 44 g/km, and 197 g/km for CO, THC, NO,, PM, and CO(2), respectively, for LPG/ gasoline dual-fuel retrofits. Paired-sample t-test results indicated that the emissions of CO (p = 0. 03), THC (p = 0. 04), and CO(2) (p = 4. 6 x 10 (- 3)) were significantly reduced with the retrofit in comparison with gasoline-powered automobiles. The reduction percentages were 71 %, 89 %, and 14 % for CO, THC, and CO(2), respectively. The average total PAH emission factor for LPG was 217 mu g/km, which is significantly lower than gasoline (863 mu g/km; p = 0. 05). The PAH corresponding carcinogenicities (BaP(eq)) were calculated via toxic equivalencies based on benzo(a) pyrene (BaP). Paired-sample t-test results for total BaPeq emissions showed no significant difference between <b>gasoline</b> (<b>30.</b> 0 mu g/km) and LPG (24. 8 mu g/km) at a confidence level of 95 %. The discrepancy between PAH and BaP(eq) emissions resulted from the higher emission percentages of high molecular weight PAHs for LPG, which might be from lubricant oil. The average emission factors of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene were 351, 4400, 324, and 1100 mu g/ km, respectively, with LPG as fuel, which were all significantly lower than those for gasoline (95 % confidence level.

Therefore, it has enormous {{economic and social}} benefits to convert heavier crude oils into high value petroleum products.

40|$|The Energy Policy Act {{requires}} the Secretary of Energy {{to determine the}} feasibility of producing sufficient replacement fuels to replace at least 30 percent of the projected consumption of motor fuels by light duty vehicles in the year 2010. The Act also {{requires the}} Secretary to determine the greenhouse gas implications {{of the use of}} replacement fuels. A replacement fuel is a non-petroleum portion of gasoline, including certain alcohols, ethers, and other components. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory Refinery Yield Model has been used to study the cost and refinery impacts for production of {open_quotes}low petroleum{close_quotes} gasolines, which contain replacement fuels. The analysis suggests that high oxygenation is the key to meeting the replacement fuel target, and a major contributor to cost increase is investment in processes to produce and etherify light olefins. High oxygenation can also increase the costs of control of vapor pressure, distillation properties, and pollutant emissions of gasolines. Year-round low petroleum <b>gasoline</b> with near- <b>30</b> percent non-petroleum components might be produced with cost increases of 23 to 37 cents per gallon of gasoline, and with greenhouse gas emissions changes between a 3 percent increase and a 16 percent decrease.

The study was significant for several reasons: 1) it is the first ever known study of its kind done on Georgia; 2) Georgia has a ninety five percent dependence rate on other states and foreign countries (indirectly) for her supply of energy resources; 3) the impact of the oil embargo on consumption, prices and the economy at large is necessary both as a post moterm and for future policy decisions.

40|$|Crude oil {{and natural}} gas often contain acid gases (H 2 S and CO 2) and trace amounts of benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) and these are all harmful to human health, {{environment}} and industrial equipment. Acid gases in chemical industry and vehicles cause corrosion to parts of engines, refinery equipment and catalysts deactivation in catalytic processes. Human exposure to H 2 S, even in low concentrations, causes burning of eyes, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, and skin irritations. Inhalation of high doses of BTX may cause skin and respiratory tract irritation. Increased energy demand and exploitation of sourer feedstock have made regulatory agencies worldwide to promulgate stricter regulations on sulfur emissions. US EPA requires a reduction of sulfur in <b>gasoline</b> from <b>30</b> ppm to 10 ppm by 2017. Crude oil and gas must be subjected to more efficient desulfurization processes. The separated acid gases and BTX is further processed in Claus process for chemical and energy recovery. 	Currently, BTX poses several technical and operational problems that result in higher operational costs and increased toxic gas emissions in Claus plants. BTX destruction in the thermal stage of Claus process was identified as the solution.

40|$|Ethanol biofuel {{could play}} an {{important}} role in reducing petroleum consumption by enabling a substantial increase in the fuel efficiency of gasoline engine vehicles. This ethanol boosted engine concept uses a small amount ethanol to increase the efficiency of use of a much larger amount of <b>gasoline</b> by approximately <b>30</b> %. <b>Gasoline</b> consumption and the corresponding CO 2 emissions would thereby be reduced by approximately 25 %. In combination with the additional reduction that results from the substitution of ethanol for gasoline as a fuel, the overall reduction in gasoline consumption and CO 2 emissions is greater than 30 %. The concept uses appropriately controlled direct injection of ethanol into the engine cylinders. The direct injection provides suppression of engine knock at high pressure. This allows high pressure operation of a much smaller, highly turbocharged engine with the same performance as a larger engine. The engine can also use a higher compression ratio. The engine downsizing and higher compression ratio results in a large increase in fuel efficiency. This approach involves only modest changes to the present gasoline engine systems and fueling infrastructure. The increase in vehicle cost could be modest (approximately $ 600) and the fuel savings payback time could be approximately 2 years. This leveraged use of ethanol to increase gasoline engine efficiency could substantially increase its energy value and help to alleviate concerns about a low energy output / input ratio (energy provided by the ethanol/energy needed to produce the ethanol). Thus the ethanol boosting concept can facilitate increased use of biofuel in addition to providing a cost-effective way to increase gasoline engine efficiency...|$|R
40|$|C 02 {{emissions}} {{are one of}} the main causes of the greenhouse effect. Reactions between C 02 and H 2, such as methanol synthesis and methanation, could {{play an important role in}} reducing these emissions. The low methanol yield, both selectivity and conversion, is the main problem in the methanol synthesis. Methanation could be considered as another alternative process, because recent research showed that the yield in methanation'process is high, the conversion of C 02 to C~ was nearly 100 %. By using a combination of the Zero Emission Petrol Vehicle (ZEPV) concept, catalytic hydrogenation of CO 2 and methanol to gasoline (MTG) process gasoline can be re-synthesised from recycle C 02. The objectives of this thesis are to examine the methanol sY!lthesis behaviour in the lab scale tubular catalytic reactor, to investigate the effect of molecular Sieve 4 A (MS 4 A) on this synthesis and to analyse the feasibility study for a re-syn fuel refinery. First, methanol synthesis experiments were performed on a CuO/ZnO/AhOJ catalyst at 190 - 2200 C, 1 bar, 3600 - 7200 h-I and H 2 /C 02 = 3 - 4. The results indicated that methanol was produced from reaction between H 2 and CO 2 at those conditions. A maximum C 02 conversion was reached at 1900 C, 1 bar, 3600 h-I and H 2 /C 02 = 4. The numerical model results predicted that the initial rate of methanol synthesis increase sharply at pressures into 50 atm and is then relativ~ly constant at pressures above 50 atm. At 50 atm, the initial rate ratio is predicted to increase 35 - 45 times than the initial rate at 1 atm. The presence of water is one of the problems affecting the synthesis. Then to investigate the effect of adding a desiccant, methanol synthesis using a CuO/ZnO/AhOJ catalyst and a MS 4 A were carried out at the conditions with the maximum CO 2 conversion. The results showed that MS 4 A adsorbed water hence the conversion of C 02 increased from 1. 13 % to 2. 12 %. According to the numerical model, these conversions are predicted 35 - 45 times at pressure around 50 atm. Finally, material and energy balances were calculated for four possible chemical pathways for this re-synthesis (the direct CO 2 hydrogenation, the Camere process, the methane to methanol process and the electrolysis process) to determine energy requirements in the re-syn fuel refineries. By using the ZEPV concept, some 70 MT/year of C 02 from the combustion of about 22 MT/year of <b>gasoline</b> in around <b>30</b> million vehicles in UK can be liquefied at 70 bar and stored on board. This liquid C 02 is available to be converted back to gasoline via methanol. The 30 % conversion, which was obtained from combination of experiment and numerical model results, was applied for direct hydrogenation of CO 2. For the other chemical pathways, the conversion used was based on previous studies. Carrying out this recycling in a set of geographically distributed 're-syn fuel' refineries using offshore wind energy has no further requirement for exploration of crude oil, no limitation of raw material and furthermore no cost penalty for the emitted carbon value. The economic analysis shows that the present (2008) forecourt price for the typical oil refinery (98 p/l) is lower than this forecourt price for the 're-syn fuel' refinery using the offshore wind energy (l 09 p/l). By predicting that the wind energy cost will be reduced to as Iowa 2. 5 plkWh in the future (2020), it is estimated that the forecourt price of gasoli~e from this futuristic sustainable resynthesis refinery would be decreased to 89 p/l. This forecourt price is cheaper than the current gasoline forecourt price from a typical conventional oil refinery. Based on this preliminary economic assessment, gasoline re-synthesis from recycled CO 2 using offshore wind energy is both perfectly sustainable and almost competitive for today and will be cheaper than gasoline from crude oil in the future.
