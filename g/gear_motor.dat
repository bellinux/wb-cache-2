50|$|The jacking <b>gear</b> <b>motor</b> is {{designed}} to rotate the shaft at approximately 1/10rpm. Most jacking gear motors are rated at 5hp. The jacking <b>gear</b> <b>motor</b> assembly applies power and torque to the reduction gear by a flexible coupling or clutch that can freely engage and disengage to the high-pressure pinion (driving gear). Engaging is accomplished {{by means of a}} simple lever. Some newer propulsion arrangements utilize an automatic control system located in the engine room. Jacking gears often feature a lock to prevent the shaft from turning during current or tide changes or when being towed.|$|E

50|$|A <b>gear</b> <b>motor</b> (external gear) {{consists}} of two gears, the driven gear (attached to the output shaft {{by way of a}} key, etc.) and the idler gear. High pressure oil is ported into one side of the gears, where it flows around the periphery of the gears, between the gear tips and the wall housings in which it resides, to the outlet port. The gears then mesh, not allowing the oil from the outlet side to flow back to the inlet side. For lubrication, the <b>gear</b> <b>motor</b> uses a small amount of oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the motor housing. An especially positive attribute of the <b>gear</b> <b>motor</b> is that catastrophic breakdown is less common than in most other types of hydraulic motors. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the motor gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a novel three-speed <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> that {{integrates}} a basic epicyclic-type gear train with an exterior-rotor brushless DC (BLDC) motor to form a compact structural assembly. Unlike existing <b>gear</b> <b>motors,</b> the proposed device provides three speed ratios including an under drive, a direct drive, and an over drive, and is operated with a single clutch-to-clutch shaft. It provides a wider speed range than the traditional <b>geared</b> <b>motor.</b> Such an integrated design can be appropriately employed in high driving torque and low rotational speed applications or high rotational speed and low driving torque applications...|$|R
40|$|A DC motor's {{performance}} is usually {{characterized by a}} series of tests, which are conducted by pass/fail criteria. In most cases, these tests are adequate to address the performance characteristics under environmental and loading effects with some uncertainties and decent power/torque margins. However, if the motor performance requirement is very stringent, {{a better understanding of the}} motor characteristics is required. The purpose of this paper is to establish a standard way to extract the torque components of the brushless <b>motor</b> and <b>gear</b> box characteristics of a high <b>gear</b> ratio <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> from the composite <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> testing and motor parameter measurement. These torque components include motor magnetic detent torque, Coulomb torque, viscous torque, windage torque, and gear tooth sliding torque. The Aerospace Corp bearing torque model and MPB torque models are used to predict the Coulomb torque of the motor rotor bearings and to model the viscous components. Gear tooth sliding friction torque is derived from the dynamo <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> test data. With these torque data, the <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> mechanical efficiency can be estimated and provide the overall performance of the <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> versus several motor operating parameters such as speed, temperature, applied current, and transmitted power...|$|R

50|$|September 21, 1992 KORL, CESSNA 210L, N2013S, Injuries: 1 Uninjured: Pilot {{stated that}} while {{attempting}} to extend the landing gear the gear hydraulic motor operated but the gear did not extend. After several seconds of <b>gear</b> <b>motor</b> operation the circuit breaker for the <b>gear</b> <b>motor</b> popped. Further attempts to extend the gear by normal and emergency procedures were unsuccessful. A gear up landing was made. After the accident the aircraft was raised and the landing gear was extended by use of the manual gear extension emergency hydraulic pump. According to maintenance personnel a wire to the nose landing gear squat switch was chafed and grounded which caused the system to be signaled for gear up at all times. They further stated the pilot could not extend the gear by use of the backup hydraulic pump because the gear down solenoid had overheated during attempts to lower the gear and froze in the gear up position. After the solenoid cooled after landing {{they were able to}} manually lower the gear. Probable cause(s): Undetected chafing and grounding of a wire to the nose landing gear squat switch which resulted in the landing gear being signaled at all times for gear up when electrical power was applied to the system. Contributing to the accident was the overheating of the gear down solenoid which caused it to stick in the gear up position and prevented the gear from being manually extended.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{field of}} {{research}} which deals with tactile sensation is called haptics. Many researchers have been investigated haptics in recent years. In the past research, 4 ch bilateral controller based on torque/force sensorless approach is developed so as to achieve high transparency as teleoperation systems. In actual system with <b>geared</b> <b>motor,</b> however, the high transparency leads to instability because of disturbances. In particular, the <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> has a large joint friction which affects the torque/force sensorless control, though its cost is low. This means that the high quality of tactile sensation is not expected in case the <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> is used in experimental system. To improve the effect of friction, linear motor is often utilized in the past research, though its cost is high. To address this issue, this paper focuses on a novel control strategy to realize low cost teleoperation systems based on the <b>geared</b> <b>motor,</b> that is, master and slave systems. To reduce the effect of joint friction, a novel approach to master and slave control by force feedback based virtual impedance controller is proposed. By using the proposed method, position and force controllers can be designed independently {{and it is one}} of remarkable features. To verify the validity of proposed method, the performance of the controller is analyzed and evaluated by using “Reproducibility ” and “Operationality”. Furthermore experimental validation is conducted with 1 -DOF manipulator...|$|R

50|$|Rotating paddle level sensors are a {{very old}} and {{established}} technique for bulk solid point level indication. The technique uses a low-speed <b>gear</b> <b>motor</b> that rotates a paddle wheel. When the paddle is stalled by solid materials, the motor is rotated on its shaft by its own torque until a flange mounted on the motor contacts a mechanical switch. The paddle can be constructed {{from a variety of}} materials, but tacky material must not be allowed to build up on the paddle. Build-up may occur if the process material becomes tacky because of high moisture levels or high ambient humidity in the hopper. For materials with very low weight per unit volume such as Pearlite, Bentonite or fly ash, special paddle designs and low-torque motors are used. Fine particles or dust must be prevented from penetrating the shaft bearings and motor by proper placement of the paddle in the hopper or bin and using appropriate seals.|$|E
5000|$|Based on this {{experience}} and after much discussion, Rob and Brian decided to attempt an event to drive over Mount Suswa in the Rift Valley. Two controls would be sited {{on either side}} of the Volcano and whoever did it in the shortest distance would be the winner. One Sunday morning in early 1989 the two set off, with motor bikes, headed for the southern slopes of Mount Suswa. After an exhausting day mostly [...] "carrying" [...] the bikes, and still only halfway up Suswa they had to head back to base, the idea wasn’t going to work! They sat looking across the Suswa plains with Lake Magadi in the distance, several small hills and large luggas in the foreground. Why not put a control on the top of each hill and one at the bottom of the escarpment? The competitors would have to find their way across the luggas to get to the hills! The following weekend, prepared with camping <b>gear,</b> <b>motor</b> bikes and their families, they spent two days driving and riding around the area setting out what eventually became the venue for the first ever Rhino Charge. Thirty-one competing vehicles entered 4 February 1989 event won by Travers Allison in a Suzuki Jeep. Distance was measured with the vehicle’s standard odometer. These pioneers probably had no idea of the huge interest this small event would attract in the years to come.At the core of the Rhino Charge is a highly dedicated group of individuals that comprise the Rhino Charge Committee. Over 25 years later, many of the original committee members are still deeply involved in the Charge. Rob and Ken are no longer with us, while Brian is still assisting the preparation of the Rhino Charge in many ways. Their legacy is a concept that has developed into the toughest offroad event on the continent and possibly anywhere. It has gained international acclaim and attracts entries from all over the world. The Kudos of winning the Rhino Charge is highly coveted in Kenya and elsewhere. Few Kenyans are not touched by the event in some way, whether taking part, being involved in the organisation, or digging into their pockets for sponsorship. By April every year, the Rhino Charge Fever hits Kenya. Wherever you go, cars are being prepared in garages, tested on and off the road. Shops are full of camping equipment, and the words [...] "where are we going this time?" [...] are heard everywhere. Then, on the Madaraka Day weekend, the exodus begins, and thousands of enthusiasts head for the hills for another Rhino Charge.|$|E

When using the vibrator, the electric power harvesting is based on piezoelectric effect and piezoelectric vibrator consists of a magnetic type oscillator, a cantilever, a bimorph actuator and controllers. Low frequency operating technique using piezoelectric vibrator is very important because normal vibration sources in the environment such as building, human body, windmill and ship have low frequency characteristics. We can know from this study results that there are many energy sources such as vibration, wind power and wave power. Also, these can be used to the energy harvesting system using smart device like piezoelectric element...|$|R
