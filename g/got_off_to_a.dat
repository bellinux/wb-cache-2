5|$|Grabner <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{hot start}} with the Rangers, scoring his first hat-trick as a Ranger against the Tampa Bay Lightning on October 30. He {{finished}} the season second on the team in goals with 27, his highest single-season total since his rookie season in 2010-11.|$|E
5|$|The Giants' record rebounded to 9–7 in 1984, and Taylor had {{his fourth}} All-Pro season. He <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> quick start, {{recording}} four sacks in a September game. In the playoffs the Giants defeated the Los Angeles Rams 16–13, but lost 21–10 to the eventual champion 49ers.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{operations}} for the incursion <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> slow start. Reconnaissance flights over the operational area were restricted since MACV believed that they might serve as a signal of intention. The role of the Air Force in the planning for the incursion itself was minimal at best, in part to preserve the secrecy of Menu which was then considered an overture to the thrust across the border.|$|E
50|$|His 2009 season <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{excellent}} {{start with}} three stages {{and the overall}} of the 2009 Tour Down Under.|$|R
50|$|Márquez {{began his}} {{professional}} career after the 1992 Olympics and <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> impressive start, winning his first 25 bouts.|$|R
500|$|The {{game was}} competitive. The Giants <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> early 3–0 lead, then the Colts scored two touchdowns <b>to</b> take <b>a</b> 14–3 halftime lead.|$|R
5|$|Asashōryū <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bad {{start in}} the July tournament by losing to Toyonoshima on the first day. After a second loss to maegashira Tochinonada on day five, he {{pulled out of the}} tournament on the sixth day citing pain in his elbow. The September tournament {{unfolded}} in a similarly poor fashion. After compiling a lacklustre 5–4 record through the first nine days, Asashōryū forfeited his tenth-day match to maegashira Gōeidō and withdrew. He had elbow pain, and presented a medical certificate.|$|E
5|$|In the {{shortened}} 2011–12 NBA season, the Blazers <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 7–2 start. But {{the team}} quickly began to collapse, as starting point guard Raymond Felton, among others, struggled with McMillan's {{new approach to}} a running-style offense. The team gained some notability as Aldridge was named to his first All-Star Game. Despite Aldridge's performance, {{the rest of the}} team became more inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|New York's 1988 season <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{turbulent}} start due an offseason scandal involving Taylor. Taylor had abused cocaine, {{violating the}} NFL's substance abuse policy and {{was suspended for}} the first four games of the season. Taylor's over-the-edge lifestyle was becoming an increasing concern for fans and team officials. After his return, however, Taylor recorded 15.5 sacks in 12 games. The intense worry and scrutiny would prove to be for naught as {{for the rest of his}} career Taylor would pass his drug tests.|$|E
50|$|Melbourne's season <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> optimal start, {{winning the}} Pre-Season Challenge Cup. A 0-0 draw {{resulted}} in a penalty shoot-out, with Victory winning 8-7 on penalties against Wellington Phoenix.|$|R
5|$|The series <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> unfortunate {{start by}} {{reproducing}} a photograph on page {{two of the}} editorial that purported to be of Eddy, but was in fact of someone else.|$|R

5|$|Speedie resurfaced in 1960, when he {{was named}} the end coach for the new American Football League's Houston Oilers under former {{teammate}} and Oilers head coach Lou Rymkus. The Oilers won the AFL championship in 1960, but Rymkus was fired after the team <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> slow start the following year. Team owner Bud Adams urged Speedie {{to stay on the}} staff, but Speedie resigned out of loyalty to Rymkus.|$|E
5|$|Super Bowl XXV {{took place}} amidst a {{background}} of war and patriotism. The Persian Gulf War had begun {{less than two weeks}} previous, and the nation rallied around the Super Bowl as a symbol of America. The Giants <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> quick 3–0 lead; however, the Bills scored the next 12 points. The Giants responded by running a nearly eight-minute drive, which culminated in a 14-yard touchdown pass from Hostetler to Stephen Baker.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{won their}} first 10 {{games of the}} 1990 season, setting a record for the best start in the team's history. The San Francisco 49ers also <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> strong start, {{matching}} New York with their own 10–0 start. Although both teams lost their next game, their Week 13 matchup was still eagerly anticipated. The Giants held the 49ers' vaunted offense to seven points, but scored just three themselves.|$|E

50|$|After leaving Northampton Town {{by mutual}} consent, Mckay signed for Scottish Premier League club Inverness Caledonian Thistle, along with Aaron Doran from Blackburn Rovers. Upon joining, his Inverness career <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> unfortunate start after {{suffering}} an early injury.|$|R
5|$|The captive {{breeding}} program, {{led by the}} San Diego Wild Animal Park and Los Angeles Zoo, {{and with}} other participating zoos around the country, including the Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden, <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> slow start due to the condor's mating habits. However, utilizing the bird's ability to double clutch, biologists began removing the first egg from the nest and raising it with puppets, allowing the parents to lay another egg.|$|E
5|$|The first {{televised}} {{match was}} Razor Ramon versus Ted DiBiase. DiBiase <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> quick start by attacking Ramon before the match began. Ramon quickly turned the match around with several clotheslines. DiBiase regained control before untying a turnbuckle cover. Ramon won the match after ramming DiBiase's {{head into the}} exposed turnbuckle and using the Razor's Edge to get the pin.|$|E
5|$|After {{the triumph}} of the {{previous}} season, the 1945–46 season was a complete loss for Kennedy. He <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> slow start, beginning the season at right wing before being returned to his center position and he also fell ill. By January Kennedy had only 5 points in 21 games and was then lost {{for the rest of the}} season due to an injury to his foot, when a Boston Bruin player's skate dug into his boot. With the Leafs also losing Captain Syl Apps to injury Toronto missed the playoffs.|$|E
50|$|The Blue Raiders <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> early lead when Logan Kilgore found Malcolm Beyah for a 26-yard {{touchdown}} pass. Carson Wiggs added a {{field goal}} as Purdue's response score to make it 7-3 {{at the end of}} the 1st quarter.|$|R
50|$|The event <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{elaborate}} {{start on}} the evening of 1 November at Sports Stadium, Bathinda with performances by Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, Sukhwinder Singh and other Punjabi artists, as well as a laser and fireworks show.|$|R
50|$|Born in Treviso, Sartor's Serie <b>A</b> career <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> inauspicious start, as {{he scored}} an own goal past goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi on his debut (and only game) for Juventus, in a 0-2 defeat at ACF Fiorentina on 6 December 1992.|$|R
5|$|Bayern <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{good start}} under Ancelotti, {{defeating}} Dortmund 2–0 in the 2016 DFL-Supercup. Despite being eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Real Madrid and the semi-finals of the DFB-Pokal by Borussia Dortmund, {{they managed to}} clinch a fifth consecutive Bundesliga title with three matches remaining following a 6–0 away win over VfL Wolfsburg. Ancelotti was sacked by Bayern on 28 September 2017 and replaced by interim manager Willy Sagnol, following a 3–0 loss to PSG in the 2017–18 Champions League group stage and a slow start to the Bundesliga season that found them in third place.|$|E
5|$|Because California {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's Mike Imoh fielded the ball at the goal line and returned it 40yards. Bryan Randall <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> good start, completing two passes for 26yards, and Kevin Jones ran the ball another 16yards. After pushing inside the California red zone, however, the California defense stiffened and Tech was prevented from gaining another first down. Kicker Carter Warley attempted his third field goal of the game—this one a 28-yard kick—but as before, the kick was no good.|$|E
5|$|Benzema <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{good start}} for the 2008–09 season, scoring twice in Lyon's opening league match against Toulouse. The {{following}} three weeks, he scored goals against Rhône-Alpes rivals Grenoble and Saint-Étienne and scored a goal against Nice, converting a penalty in the dying seconds. Lyon won all three matches. As {{a result of his}} early goals, Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas quelled the many transfer rumors surrounding Benzema by placing a €100million price tag on the striker. He was also nominated alongside Franck Ribéry to be featured on the French cover of the video game FIFA 09.|$|E
50|$|After {{a largely}} {{unsuccessful}} underage career with 'the Barr's', Barry-Murphy {{had joined the}} club's senior team by 1972. His career <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> inauspicious start that year when he was sent off in a club game and received a two-month suspension.|$|R

5000|$|The Chamber <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> initial {{slow start}} with its primary {{supporters}} focusing {{most of their}} efforts on tariff policy lobbying, especially in setting up a [...] "Protection Union", in direct opposition to the [...] "Free Traders" [...] led by Sir Henry Parkes.|$|R
5|$|Butler <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mediocre start, losing {{twice in}} the 76 Classic 82–73 to 22nd-ranked Minnesota and to 19th-ranked Clemson 70–69. After the tournament Butler's record stood at 4–2 and the team dropped to #23 in the AP Poll and #20 in the Coaches' Poll. Butler won its next two games before falling to 13th-ranked Georgetown 72–65 in the Jimmy V Classic. The team won its next two games beating #15 Ohio State 74–66 and edging out former conference rival Xavier 69–68, both at home. After losing 67–57 at UAB three days later, Butler stood at 9–4 and {{fell out of the}} AP rankings. However, the team {{remained}} in the Coaches Poll at #23.|$|E
5|$|In 1927–28 Australian season, Woodfull {{played in}} five matches and was highly {{productive}} {{in the last}} three. He scored 99 and 191 not out in a victory over New South Wales, before adding 106 in an innings triumph over South Australia. He rounded off the season with 94 and 81 not out in a draw in the return match against New South Wales. He ended the Australian campaign with 645 runs at 129.00.

5|$|Miami <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{good start}} {{doing just that}} as it raced out to four {{consecutive}} wins to begin the season, including a victory over nationally ranked rival No. 9 Florida State. On October 11, however, Miami traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to face the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and suffered its first loss of the season to the undefeated Irish, who {{would go on to}} be ranked No. 1 in the country. This defeat was followed in succession by two others, but the Hurricanes were able to stop the slide on November 8 with a homecoming win over East Carolina. Miami added two more wins {{before the end of the}} season, and brought the regular season to a close with an overall record of 83.|$|E
50|$|As {{it turned}} out, Zuvella <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{extremely}} slow {{start with the}} Yankees, going hitless in his first 28 at bats. By {{the end of the}} season, he was reassigned to the Yankees' triple-A affiliate, the Columbus Clippers, and Wayne Tolleson was given the starting shortstop job.|$|R
50|$|Malik's Worcestershire career <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{excellent}} start, when after claiming 6-41 {{in a minor}} {{match against}} Cardiff UCCE he marked his first-class debut for his new county with 5-88 against Kent, his first victim being Test batsman Rob Key. Shortly afterwards, Malik took 4-42 in a totesport League game against Sussex.|$|R
50|$|The game <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> inauspicious {{start for}} K-State, as kick {{returner}} James Johnson fumbled the opening kickoff and was recovered by Iowa State's James Smith at the Wildcat 32. The Cyclones (2-8, 1-5 Big 12) quickly capitalized, as Brett Meyer found Derrick Catlett from one-yard {{out for the}} early 7-0 advantage.|$|R
