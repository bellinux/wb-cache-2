The activities of marine geodesy are related to the utilization of satellite technology, electronic distance measurement, geodetic astronomy, gravimetric geodesy, and the potentially usable very long baseline interferometry. Assessments are made of the different accuracy and/or precision requirements involved in the various approaches. It is shown that marine geodesy is highly relevant to man's various practical and scientific operations at sea, including those on the continental shelves...|$|R

30|$|Stereo DTMs of Warrego Valles and Elysium Planitia are {{demonstrated}} in Figs. 2 (b), 2 (c) and 3 (b). Compared with the Eberswalde Crater, the stereo <b>geodetic</b> <b>controlling</b> was performed under harsh conditions. Over Warrego Valles, the target CTX stereo pair (P 07 003633 1378 and P 08 _ 004266 _ 1377) was taken under long exposing time (2 – 3 times than the normal CTX image strip) of CCD over steep slope terrain. As the sensor to target relationship cannot be simply interpolated into generic function, the accurate sensor modeling {{especially in the}} regression of pointing information was therefore difficult to achieve. Note that basically the sensor model was the mapping function from target to image coordinate. The employment of the high order polynomial form to address in the generic sensor model would increase the instability. Consequently, the constructed stereo terrain was slanted into one direction and the discontinuities distributed along the boundary of CTX and HRSC DTMs (h 0453 _ 0000) were obvious. To address this issue, the non-rigorous sensor model was built up only in a portion of CTX pairs and applied in stereo interpretation. However, the discontinuity up to 60 m vertically still remained along upper left portion of CTX DTM as shown in Fig. 2 (b). The details in fluvial channels and crater could be clearly observed and the dimension was measureable with the stereo DTM. As for the HiRISE data of Warrego Valles, mismatching CCD overlapping flaw {{was found in the}} acquired stereo pair. This was caused by the high frequency oscillation of spacecraft (McEwen et al., 2007) and the proper solution using USGS’s ISIS software was proposed by Kirk et al. (2008). Together with the CCD mismatching issue, complicated geological features extensively populating over Warrego Valles also affect the performance of tie points setting algorithm between CCD lines in USGS ISIS. Due to the factors described above, the processing of HiRISE stereo pair in Warrego Valles will be possible after the publication of USGS HiJACK routine (Mattson et al., 2009), with which the interruption in CCD boundaries was minimized. With the resultant high-resolution 3 D topography of HIRISE, it is expected that the transportation mechanism interpretation can be applied to identify the origin of Warrego Valles.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the Higher Geodesy Laboratory of NTU and the Seismology Department of the Institut de Physique A Globe de Paris have {{carried out a}} {{research}} program concerning {{the evaluation of the}} tectonic behaviour of the Gulf of Corinth, in Greece, based on geodetic data. The area being one of the densely populated, seismically active parts of Greece, was considered suitable for monitoring deformations. Aus, a <b>geodetic</b> GPS <b>control</b> network of 193 points, spread over a broad area (of about 10 000 km(2)) {{on both sides of the}} Gulf, was established within seven years. During this period several points were re-occupied. Thus the GPS data acquired are sparse both in space and time. In order to estimate the deformation over longer periods of time 142 of the network points were chosen to belong to the Hellenic triangulation network. In the present paper, statistically acceptable strain parameters are evaluated via a multi-epoch deformation model using GPS data alone as well as in combination with positional information from old geodetic surveys...|$|R

Reconstructing three-dimensional structural changes in the forest over time is possible using archived aerial photographs and photogrammetric techniques, which have recently been introduced to a larger audience {{with the advent of}} digital photogrammetry. This paper explores the feasibility of constructing an accurate time-series of archived aerial photographs spanning 42 years using different types of geometric data and estimation methods for image orientation. A recent airborne laser scanning (lidar) data set was combined with the image block and assessed for geometric match. The results suggest {{that it is possible to}} establish the multitemporal geometry of an image block to an accuracy that is better than 0. 5 m in 3 D and constant over time. Even <b>geodetic</b> ground <b>control</b> points can be omitted from the estimation if the most recent images have accurate direct sensor orientation, which is becoming a standard technique in aerial photography. This greatly reduces the costs and facilitates the work.
