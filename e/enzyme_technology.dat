40|$|Prebiotics were {{initially}} defined as nondigestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity {{of one or}} {{a limited number of}} bacteria in the colon, and thus improve host health. A recent refinement of this definition maintains that prebiotics are selectively fermented ingredients that allow specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confer benefits upon host well-being and health. The most studied prebiotics are the fructans inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides. Over the past years, we used a multidisciplinary approach—in part funded by Healthgrain—to study the properties of arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides (AXOS) as a novel prebiotic dietary fibre. We here report on a pilot-scale process for extraction of AXOS from wheat bran and on studies of their prebiotic effects in chickens and rats as well as in humans.

50|$|Research has {{explored}} {{the possibility of}} replacing SSL {{with the use of}} enzymes. Enzyme technologies, by themselves, {{have not been able to}} completely replace SSL. A major limitation of enzymes is the production of gummy bread of unpredictable quality. Also, enzymes often do not augment dough strength, which is necessary to prevent loaf collapse during baking. Currently, enzymes are being used in conjunction with SSL to maximize the shelf life of bread. SSL is very good at increasing softness of bread during the first week after baking. <b>Enzyme</b> <b>technology</b> works best after the first 5 days of shelf life. Therefore, bread with optimal softness throughout the desired shelf life is obtained by using a combination of these technologies.|$|E

The AGP collapses the two weeks of glucose data and plots only by time allowing for underlying patterns to be identified. It uses five smoothed frequency curves to represent glucose exposure, variability and stability while simultaneously identifying periods of significant hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.

40|$|Dietary fiber is {{a complex}} {{nutritional}} concept whose definition and method of analysis has evolved over time. However, literature {{on the role of}} dietary fiber on mineral bioavailability has not followed pace. Although in vitro studies revealed mineral binding properties, both animal and human studies failed to show negative effects on mineral absorption, and even in some cases reported absorption enhancing properties. The existing literature suggests that dietary fibers have negative effects on mineral absorption in the gastrointestinal tract largely due to mineral binding or physical entrapment. However, colonic fermentation of dietary fibers may offset this negative effect by liberating bound minerals and promoting colonic absorption. However, existing studies are limited since they did not control for more potent mineral absorption inhibitors such as phytates and polyphenols. Animal studies have mostly been on rats and hence difficult to extrapolate to humans. Human studies have been mostly on healthy young men, who likely to have an adequate store of iron. The use of different types and amounts of fibers (isolated/added) with varying physiological and physicochemical properties makes it difficult to compare results. Future studies can make use of the opportunities offered by <b>enzyme</b> <b>technologies</b> to decipher the role of dietary fibers in mineral bioavailability...|$|R
40|$|The cereal non-starch {{polysaccharide}} dietary fibres beta-glucan and arabinoxylan (AX), which {{can contribute to}} health, occur both under a soluble and an insoluble form. The latter can enzymically be solubilised. Barley and wheat, rich in beta-glucan and AX respectively, can thus be valuable sources of soluble fibre. The objective of Solfibread, an EU sponsored research project (www. solfibread. com), was to enhance the health promoting effect of bread by providing and implementing technologies for increased barley and wheat soluble fibre levels in consumer acceptable staple food bread products. Specific objectives were to optimise the production of barley flour {{both in terms of}} nutritional as well as functional effects, to investigate the functional potential of barley proteins, to identify efficient endoxylanases and characterise barley endoxylanase inhibitors, to investigate the beta-glucan in breadmaking and to optimise the production of bread containing milled barley products in terms of both health promoting and organoleptic properties. We demonstrate that we were successful in developing and industrially implementing technology for milling hull-less barley into flour. We were equally successful in the development of palatable breads with added value in terms of health promoting effects through increasing the levels of both soluble beta-glucan and AX and new <b>enzyme</b> <b>technologies.</b> status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} {{has been developed}} to rapidly screen enzyme inhibitor candidates from complex mixtures, such as those created by combinatorial synthesis. Inhibitor libraries are screened by using immobilized <b>enzyme</b> <b>technologies</b> and electrospray ionization ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The library mixture is first sprayed into the mass spectrometer, and compounds are identified. The library is subsequently incubated with the immobilized enzyme of interest under the correct conditions (buffer, pH, temperature) by using an excess of enzyme to ensure a surplus of sites for ligand binding. The immobilized enzyme/inhibitor mixture is centrifuged, and an aliquot of supernatant is again analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Potential inhibitors are quickly identified by comparison of the spectra before and after incubation with the immobilized enzyme. Non-inhibitors show no change in ion intensity after incubation, whereas weak inhibitors exhibit a visible decrease in ion abundance. Once inhibitor candidates have been identified, the library is reinjected into the mass spectrometer, and tandem mass spectrometry is {{used to determine the}} structure of the inhibitor candidates as needed. This method has been successfully demonstrated by identifying inhibitors of the enzymes pepsin and glutathione S-transferase from a 19 - and 17 -component library, respectively. It is further shown that the immobilized enzyme can be recycled and reused for continuous screening of additional new libraries without adding additional enzyme...|$|R
