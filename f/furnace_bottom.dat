40|$|AbstractIn {{electric}} furnaces destined for experimental geochemical investigations, a small temperature gradient (TG) always exists, {{and it is}} difficult to avoid it.

Long-term runs with quartz and water at 300 Â°C have shown the attainment of equilibrium at TG equal to - 0. 16 Â°/cm. At TG equal to 0. 25 Â°/cm, the silica re- precipitated from the ampoule bottom onto its walls above the meniscus, and the aqueous silica concentration was reduced and became 300 times lower than quartz solubility. The obtained results were explained by the combined action of slow convection of water and thermal diffusion of silica.

This automated technique is able to simultaneously measure inter particle variations in chemistry (energy dispersive X-ray spectra) and size (shape). Two key variables for application in geopolymers, Si:Al ratio and size, are measured using FS&CT for coal combustion fly ash and its fraction of potentially reactive aluminium-silicate particles. These measurements have been preliminary related to the reactivity of the fly ash in NaOH-solutions with high liquid/solid ratios as well as low liquid/solid ratios (geopolymers).
