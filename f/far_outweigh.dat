25|$|Some goalkeepers {{have scored}} goals. Other than by {{accident}} when a long kicked clearance reaches {{the other end}} of the field and evades the opposing goalkeeper with the aid of strong winds and/or unexpected bounces, this most commonly occurs where a goalkeeper has rushed up to the opposite end of the pitch to give his team a numerical advantage in attack, leaving his own goal undefended. As such, it is normally only done late in a game at set-pieces where the consequences of scoring <b>far</b> <b>outweigh</b> those of conceding a further goal, such as for a team trailing in a knock-out tournament.|$|E
25|$|Trees {{should not}} be labeled as polluters because their total {{benefits}} on air quality and emissions reduction <b>far</b> <b>outweigh</b> the possible consequences of BVOC emissions on ozone concentrations. Emission of BVOCs increase exponentially with temperature. Therefore, higher emissions will occur at higher temperatures. In desert climates, locally native trees adapted to drought conditions emit significantly less BVOCs than plants native to wet regions. As discussed above, the formation of ozone is also temperature dependent. Thus, {{the best way to}} slow the production of ozone and emission of BVOCs is to reduce urban temperatures and the effect of the urban heat island. As suggested earlier, {{the most effective way to}} lower temperatures is with an increased canopy cover.|$|E
25|$|Wallenstein's army marched north, occupying Mecklenburg, Pomerania, and Jutland itself, but proved {{unable to}} take the Dano-Norwegian capital Copenhagen {{on the island of}} Zealand. Wallenstein lacked a fleet, and neither the Hanseatic ports nor the Poles would allow the {{building}} of an imperial fleet on the Baltic coast. He then laid siege to Stralsund, the only belligerent Baltic port with sufficient facilities to build a large fleet; it soon became clear, however, that the cost of continuing the war would <b>far</b> <b>outweigh</b> any gains from conquering the rest of Denmark.

25|$|In the past, {{mortality}} rates for females in child-bearing age groups {{were higher than}} for males at the same age. This {{is no longer the}} case, and female human life expectancy is considerably higher than that of males. The reasons for this are not entirely certain. Traditional arguments tend to favor sociology-environmental factors: historically, men have generally consumed more tobacco, alcohol and drugs than women in most societies, {{and are more likely to}} die from many associated diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis and cirrhosis of the liver. Men are also more likely to die from injuries, whether unintentional (such as occupational, war or car accidents) or intentional (suicide). Men are also more likely to die from most of the leading causes of death (some already stated above) than women. Some of these in the United States include: cancer of the respiratory system, motor vehicle accidents, suicide, cirrhosis of the liver, emphysema, prostate cancer, and coronary heart disease. These <b>far</b> <b>outweigh</b> the female mortality rate from breast cancer and cervical cancer.|$|E
25|$|Studies from China, Denmark, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom {{show that}} regular cyclists live longer because {{the health effects}} <b>far</b> <b>outweigh</b> the risk of crashes. A {{reduction}} in the number of cyclists is likely to harm the health of the population more than any possible protection from injury. UK figures show that it takes at least 8000 years of average cycling to produce one clinically severe head injury and 22,000 years for one death. De Jong developed a mathematical model to evaluate the health-risk trade-offs of all-age mandatory helmet laws, if they were to be introduced in various North American and Western European countries. He concluded that helmet laws appear to offer net health benefit only in those countries with more dangerous bicycling environments under optimistic assumptions of the efficacy of helmets. Newbold suggested improvements to the De Jong model, and, using published cycling statistics for the United States in his revised model, found that mandatory bicycle helmet laws would seem to have positive net public health benefits there. However, Newbold stressed that there were many parameters to these models which require further research to properly quantitate, and that results should be considered provisional rather than definitive.|$|E

500|$|Many {{supporters}} of Native American mascots {{feel that the}} financial cost of changing mascots would <b>far</b> <b>outweigh</b> the benefits. Sales of merchandise with team mascots and nicknames ranging from T-shirts to beer cozies generate {{millions of dollars in}} sales each year, and teams contend that a change in team mascots would render this merchandise useless. The cost of removing images from uniforms and all other items, which must be paid out of local school funds, is a greater factor for secondary schools. Opponents feel that despite the cost of a change in team mascots, it should be done to prevent what they believe is racial stereotyping. Clyde Bellecourt, when director of the American Indian Movement stated: [...] "It's the behavior that accompanies all of this that's offensive. The rubber tomahawks, the chicken feather headdresses, people wearing war paint and making these ridiculous war whoops with a tomahawk {{in one hand and a}} beer in the other; all of these have significant meaning for us.

500|$|Criticism of {{the style}} of the book has {{centered}} on its political aspects. Heinlein's discussions of his political beliefs were criticized as [...] "didactic", and the novel was derided for [...] "exposition [...] inserted in large indigestible chunks". Author Ken MacLeod's 2003 analysis of the political nature of Starship Troopers stated that it was [...] "a book where civics infodumps and accounts of brutal boot-camp training <b>far</b> <b>outweigh</b> the thin and tensionless combat scenes". Scientist and author John Brunner compared it to a [...] "Victorian children's book", while the Science Fiction Handbook published in 2009 said that the novel provided [...] "compelling images of a futuristic military" [...] and that it raised important questions, even for those who disagree with its political ideology. However, it stated that the story was weak as a tale of an alien encounter, as it did not explore alien society in any detail, but presented the Arachnids as nameless and faceless creatures that wished to destroy humanity. Anthony Boucher, founder of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, remarked in 1960 that Heinlein had [...] "forgotten to insert a story". A 1979 summary said that though Heinlein's vision might verge on fascism, his tightly controlled narrative made his ideology seem [...] "vibrantly appealing".|$|E
500|$|Perhaps Browner's biggest triumph came in 1997, {{when she}} {{convinced}} Clinton {{to support a}} stringent tightening of the Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards regarding permissible levels of the ground-level ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot. [...] The decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade. [...] There was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration, with opposition from the president's economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said {{the costs of the}} new standards would <b>far</b> <b>outweigh</b> any benefits and that Browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the EPA's scientific reviews on the matter. [...] Over eighty environmental and health groups, who had grown quite frustrated with the administration's preference for minimal-cost incremental actions in the area, pressured Vice President Gore to take a stand on the matter, but he remained silent. [...] Browner's adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost single-handedly, in private meetings, Congressional testimony, and public debate, and had come {{in the face of a}} silence from the White House that had put at risk her standing within the administration. [...] Some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination. [...] Ultimately, Gore lent behind-the-scenes support in favor of the new regulations, which was a key factor in Clinton's final decision in Browner's favor. [...] Overall, the New York Times termed Browner's actions [...] "a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura" [...] and Time magazine labelled Browner the [...] "Queen of Clean Air". [...] As the decision was announced, one which would affect hundreds of American cities and towns, Browner said: [...] "These new standards will provide new health protections to 125million Americans, including 35million children." ...|$|E
