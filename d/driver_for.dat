50|$|All {{hardware}} developers provide device <b>drivers</b> <b>for</b> {{their products}} over {{a range of}} operating systems. But some developers of graphics hardware provide no free and open-source <b>drivers</b> <b>for</b> their hardware and they provide little or no technical documentation to support independent development of free and open-source device <b>drivers</b> <b>for</b> their products. The free and open-source device <b>drivers</b> available <b>for</b> hardware with support <b>for</b> independent <b>driver</b> development are generally of much higher quality in terms of completeness, stability, security performance than <b>drivers</b> <b>for</b> hardware that lack such support.|$|R

5|$|Webber {{was signed}} as test <b>driver</b> <b>for</b> the Arrows F1 team for 2000, and also gained {{sponsorship}} from Australian beer company Foster's whilst competing in Formula 3000. Webber took victory in round {{two of the}} season at Silverstone, and finished the series with two fastest laps and three podiums {{on his way to}} third overall—the highest position of any rookie that year. Contract issues meant that Webber was never able to drive the Arrows A21 car, and rejected a full contract offer for 2001 in July. However, he was offered a three-day evaluation test for Benetton {{at the end of the}} year, outpacing F1 drivers Ralf Schumacher and Giancarlo Fisichella at Estoril. The results were good enough to earn him the test driver role with the team for 2001, and he also agreed to take on team boss Flavio Briatore as manager in return for finance for a further F3000 season. Webber joined the championship-winning Super Nova Racing team, and despite winning at Imola, Monaco and Magny-Cours, he finished second overall to British driver Justin Wilson. Webber was replaced as test <b>driver</b> <b>for</b> Benetton for 2002 by Fernando Alonso, but Briatore managed to secure Webber a contract to race alongside Alex Yoong in the Stoddart-owned Minardi team, making him the first Australian in Formula One since David Brabham in 1994.|$|E
