40|$|The use {{of carbon}} for plasma-facing {{components}} in ITER {{is assumed to}} cause the safety limit of a maximum of 350 g tritium in the reactor vessel to be exceeded. Tritium is trapped primarily in amorphous hydrocarbon layers on the reactor vessel's surfaces. Within this paper a diagnostic method, the laser-induced thermal desorption spectroscopy (LDS), will be developed to measure in situ the hydrogen inventory in the surface of plasma-facing components in fusion experiments. Its capabilities will be demonstrated in TEXTOR. In LDS, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge</b> a laser beam is used to heat a spot on a surface close to the plasma to a temperature of 1400 to 2100 K {{to a depth of}} 100 μm. Trapped hydrogen will be released into the plasma where it emits line radiation. The emitted H$_{α}$-light is quantitatively measured. The amount of released hydrogen is calculated from the intensity of this emission using conversion factors (S/XB) $_{eff}$. The laser light (Nd:YAG, 1064 nm) is conducted via light fibres. At TEXTOR, a 5 mm$^{ 2 }$ sized homogeneous laser spot is created with a pulse duration of 1. 5 ms, and an Energy of 5 J, typically. Below the laser spot a volume of at most 1 mm$^{ 3 }$ is desorbed. The generated temperature is calculated numerically and indirectly deduced from surface changings. Depending on the conditions during the layer formation the hydrogen content of the hydrocarbon layer will vary and different fractions of the released molecules (H$_{ 2 }, CH_{ 4 }, C_{ 2 }H_{ 4 }$) are created during the laser heating. Hydrogen-rich layers release a greater fraction of hydrocarbons whereas graphite exposed in the erosion zone releases principally hydrogen molecules. The release of atomic hydrogen by laser desorption was not found. The emitted light is measured by means of narrow-band interference filters and a CCD-camera. The fraction of the light emission which lies outside the observation volume is estimated using simulations of the emission by the neutral gas transport Monte Carlo code EIRENE for each molecular fraction. Conversion factors (S/XB) $_{eff}$ were measured in various reference plasmas (T$_{e}$ = 22 – 30 eV, n$_{e}$ = 1 – 11 x 10 $^{ 18 }$ m$^{- 3 }$ and T$_{e}$ = 50 – 74 eV, n$_{e}$ = 1 – 5 x 10 $^{ 18 }$ m$^{- 3 }$) by desorbing prepared graphite samples which release a known amount of hydrogen with a known molecular distribution. LDS measurements were carried out in TEXTOR at hydrocarbon layers deposited on a graphite test limiter. The desorbed layers had been deposited within up to 3 minutes of plasma exposure, which is 40 % of an ITER plasma discharge. The measured hydrogen inventories could be validated in post-mortem analyses. For the first time, LDS allowed for measuring the hydrogen inventory in the erosiondominated zone of a graphite limiter during a plasma discharge. The inventory was found to be larger <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge</b> than between two discharges. The deduced dynamic hydrogen inventory <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge</b> is 1 – 8 x 10 $^{ 20 }$ atoms/m$^{ 2 }$, depending on the plasma conditions (H$^{+}$ flux density, plasma temperature). This is in line with a mean retention time of 1. 9 to 3. 6 ms. It was shown that LDS allows a sensitive measurement (detection limit below 10 $^{ 20 }$ m$^{- 2 }$) of hydrogen inventories in the surface of plasma-facing components during a plasma discharge...|$|E

There are many tools to analyze the plasma response to the power modulations under quasi-stationary conditions.

40|$|A {{change of}} the {{particle}} density (by gas puff, pellets or impurity seeding) <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge</b> in tokamak produces a radial current and implicitly a torque and rotation that can modify the state of confinement. After ionization the newly born ions will evolve toward the periodic neoclassical orbits (trapped or circulating) but {{the first part of}} their excursion, which precedes the periodicity, is an effective radial current. It is short, spatially finite and unique for each new ion, but multiplied by the rate of ionization and it can produce a substantial total radial current. The associated torque induces rotation which modify the transport processes. We derive the magnitude of the radial current induced by ionization by three methods: the analysis of a simple physical picture, a numerical model and the neoclassical drift-kinetic treatment. The results of the three approaches are in agreement and show that the current can indeed be substantial. Many well known experimental observations can be reconsidered under this perspective. In reactor-grade plasma the confinement can be strongly influenced by adequate particle fuelling. Comment: Extended form of the paper presented at EPS 40 Conference (Espoo, 2013).

Moreover, the emission intensity from the radiative state of Ar^ + * provides the necessary data on the ground state ions density Ar^ + [...] [36].|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} bipolar pulsed power source for DBD {{discharges}} operating at high frequency, in the range around 20 kHz. The main characteristic of this power source is the low power consumption (around 30 watts) and the great volume of <b>plasma</b> produced inside <b>the</b> reactor. The reactor mixes the effect corona and the well known effects of dielectric barrier between electrodes. The electrical characterization of the power source and <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge</b> is presented {{as well as a}} FEM model to simulate the electrical field distribution inside the reactor. Whit this electrical characterization of <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>the</b> efficiency of the power source is demonstrated to be 76. 9 %. As an application, the NOx removal is proposed. 1...|$|R
40|$|Chaotic {{behavior}} in <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge</b> is experimentally studied. <b>The</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge</b> {{is generated by}} twelve-phase altemating current power supply systems. A new type of chaotic state wIth a doublc scroll type attractor is observed. Strange attractors、Poincare sections correlation dimensions are calculated to quantitatively characterize the chaotic state. A nonlinear Schrodinger type equation is considered for qualitative description of observed chaos...|$|R

A {{significant increase in the}} film roughness (p 0. 05) was observed for the thermal properties of the antimicrobial films after DBD plasma treatment...|$|R
40|$|A plasma {{electrothermal}} thruster includes a capillary passage {{in which a}} <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge</b> is formed and directed out of an open end of the passage into a supersonic nozzle. Liquid supplied to the capillary passage becomes partially atomized to cool a confining surface of <b>the</b> passage. <b>The</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge</b> is formed as the atomized liquid flows out of the open end into a supersonic equilibrium nozzle. The discharge can have a duration greater than the two way travel time of acoustic energy in the capillary to cause <b>the</b> <b>plasma</b> to flow continuously through <b>the</b> nozzle <b>during</b> <b>the</b> time of the discharge pulse...|$|R
