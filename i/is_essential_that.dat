5|$|In DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases {{make copies}} of DNA polynucleotide chains. To {{preserve}} biological information, it <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction {{by the lack of}} base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> Shraddha be {{performed}} by the sonusually the eldestor male relative of the paternal branch of the family, limited to the preceding three generations. However, on Sarvapitri amavasya or matamaha, the daughter's son can offer Shraddha for the maternal side of his family if a male heir is absent in his mother's family. Some castes only perform the shraddha for one generation. Prior to performing the rite, the male should have experienced a sacred thread ceremony. Since the ceremony is considered inauspicious due to its association with death, the royal family of Kutch, the king or heirs of the throne are prohibited from conducting Shraddha.|$|E

To give LTBI treatment to someone with active TB is a serious error: the TB will not be adequately treated {{and there is a}} risk of developing drug-resistant strains of TB.|$|E
25|$|The use of two lasers to {{heat the}} sample reduces the axial {{temperature}} gradient, this which allows for thicker samples to be heated more evenly. In order for a double-sided heating system to be successful it <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> the two lasers are aligned {{so that they are}} both focused on the sample position. For in situ heating in diffraction experiments, the lasers need to be focused to the same point in space where the X-ray beam is focused.|$|E
25|$|Drawing {{molecules}} {{requires a}} transformation between molecular coordinates (usually, but not always, in Angstrom units) and the screen. Because many molecules are chiral it <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> the handedness {{of the system}} (almost always right-handed) is preserved. In molecular graphics the origin (0, 0) is usually at the lower left, while in many computer systems the origin is at top left. If the z-coordinate {{is out of the}} screen (towards the viewer) the molecule will be referred to right-handed axes, while the screen display will be left-handed.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{melamine}} as fertilizer for crops {{had been}} envisaged during the 1950s and 1960s {{because of its}} high nitrogen content (2/3). However, melamine is much more expensive to produce than are other common nitrogen fertilizers, such as urea. To be effective as a fertilizer, it <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> the plant nutrients are released or made available {{in a manner that}} matches the needs of the growing crop. The nitrogen mineralization process for melamine is extremely slow, making this product both economically and scientifically impractical for use as a fertilizer.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the groups}} who {{originally}} supported the change to the Act also said that a law change was not a fully adequate response {{to protect children from}} abuse. The New Zealand Anglican Bishops said 'It <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> changes to section 59 go hand in hand with increased access to high quality public educational programmes, which encourage non-violent discipline and child rearing.' The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) also put pressure on the New Zealand Government for education and promotion of changing attitudes and parenting practice.|$|E

The scale is based on naturalistic observations completed by Ainsworth {{over a period of several}} hours and thus has no short procedure outline. Her method uses a nine-point scale (nine being very high and one being very low) in a number of important maternal traits. In order for this measurement to be accurate, it <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> the researcher has developed good observations and insight into the behaviour of the caregiver.|$|E

25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> the {{overproduction}} of {{uric acid}} be controlled {{in order to}} reduce the risk of nephropathy, nephrolithiasis, and gouty arthritis. The drug allopurinol is utilized to stop the conversion of oxypurines into uric acid, and prevent the development of subsequent arthritic tophi (produced after having chronic gout), kidney stones, and nephropathy, the resulting kidney disease. Allopurinol is taken orally, at a typical dose of 3–20mg/kg per day. The dose is then adjusted to bring the uric acid level down into the normal range (<3nbsp&mg/dL). Most affected individuals can be treated with allopurinol all through life.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> {{there is}} some {{connection}} between a misrepresentation and a claimant's entry into the contract. For instance in Attwood v Small Mr Small made false claims about the capabilities of mines and steelworks, which he was selling to Mr Attwood. Mr Attwood said he would verify the claims before he bought. He employed agents to check. The agents said the claims were true. It turned out they were not. But the House of Lords held that Mr Attwood could not escape the contract, since he did not rely on Mr Small. He relied on his agents.|$|E
25|$|In close-quarters {{fighting}} {{there is}} no more deadly weapon than the knife. In choosing a knife there are two important factors to bear in mind: balance and keenness. The hilt should fit easily in your hand, and the blade should not be so heavy that it tends to drag the hilt from your fingers in a loose grip. It <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> the blade have a sharp stabbing point and good cutting edges, because an artery torn through (as against a clean cut) tends to contract and stop the bleeding. If a main artery is cleanly severed, the wounded man will quickly lose consciousness and die.|$|E

25|$|Often {{more than}} one ELS related to some topic can be {{displayed}} simultaneously in an ELS letter array. This is produced by writing out the text in a regular grid, with exactly {{the same number of}} letters in each line, then cutting out a rectangle. In the example below, part of the King James Version of Genesis (26:5–10) is shown with 33 letters per line. ELSs for BIBLE and CODE are shown. Normally only a smaller rectangle would be displayed, such as the rectangle drawn in the figure. In that case there would be letters missing between adjacent lines in the picture, but it <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> the number of missing letters be the same for each line.|$|E
25|$|The next rower ('seven' in an eight) sits {{directly}} behind stroke and is typically both fit and skilled: this rower {{acts as a}} buffer between the stroke {{and the rest of}} the crew. They closely follow the rhythm set by the stroke and help transmit this rhythm to the rest of the boat, and particularly to the rowers rowing on the same side as seven, since rowers tend to look at the blades on their side of the boat to check their timing. If the strokeman increases or decreases the stroke rate it <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> seven follows this change so that it is translated to the rest of the crew. Number seven usually watches the back of stroke so that they can time when to move up the slide and copy their rhythm. The job of seven is to emulate the rhythm of the strokeman.|$|E
25|$|When we {{point out}} the need of {{opposing}} Trotskyism we discover a very strange phenomenon, that voices are raised in its defense {{in the ranks of}} certain organizations and among certain circles in certain parties. These voices belong to people who themselves are intoxicated with this counter-revolutionary ideology. The Trotskyists have long been transformed into the agents of Fascism, into the agents of the German Gestapo. We saw this on the ground during the May putsch in Catalonia; we saw this clearly in the disturbances that occurred in various other places. And everybody will realize this when the trial opens against the P.O.U.M. leaders who were caught spying. And we realize that the hand of Fascism is behind every attempt to demoralize our home front, to undermine the authority of the Republic. Therefore it <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> we wipe out Trotskyism with a firm hand, for Trotskyism is no longer a political option for the working class but an instrument of the counter-revolution.|$|E

25|$|Known as {{a classic}} example of a Gentle Giant, the Saint Bernard is calm, patient and sweet with adults, and {{especially}} children. However St. Bernards, like all very large dogs, must be well socialized with people and other dogs in order to prevent fearfulness and any possible aggression or territoriality. The biggest threat to small children is being knocked over by this breed's larger size. Overall they are a sweet, gentle, calm, loyal and affectionate breed, and if socialized are very friendly. Because of its large adult size, it <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> proper training and socialization begin while the St. Bernard is still a puppy, so as to avoid the difficulties that normally accompany training large dogs. An unruly St. Bernard may present problems for even a strong adult, so control needs to be asserted {{from the beginning of the}} dog's training. While generally not instinctively protective, a St. Bernard may bark at strangers, and their size makes them good deterrents against possible intruders.|$|E
25|$|Opioid effects (adverse or otherwise) can be {{reversed}} with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone or naltrexone. These competitive antagonists bind to the opioid receptors with higher affinity than agonists {{but do not}} activate the receptors. This displaces the agonist, attenuating or reversing the agonist effects. However, the elimination half-life of naloxone can be shorter {{than that of the}} opioid itself, so repeat dosing or continuous infusion may be required, or a longer acting antagonist such as nalmefene may be used. In patients taking opioids regularly it <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> the opioid is only partially reversed to avoid a severe and distressing reaction of waking in excruciating pain. This is achieved by not giving a full dose but giving this in small doses until the respiratory rate has improved. An infusion is then started to keep the reversal at that level, while maintaining pain relief. Opioid antagonists remain the standard treatment for respiratory depression following opioid overdose, with naloxone being by far the most commonly used, although the longer acting antagonist nalmefene may be used for treating overdoses of long-acting opioids such as methadone, and diprenorphine is used for reversing the effects of extremely potent opioids used in veterinary medicine such as etorphine and carfentanil. However, since opioid antagonists also block the beneficial effects of opioid analgesics, they are generally useful only for treating overdose, with use of opioid antagonists alongside opioid analgesics to reduce side effects, requiring careful dose titration and often being poorly effective at doses low enough to allow analgesia to be maintained.|$|E
500|$|As {{recently}} as the 1950s, hatches had wooden covers that would be broken apart and rebuilt by hand, rather than opened and closed. [...] Newer vessels have hydraulic-operated metal hatch covers that can often be operated by one person. [...] Hatch covers can slide forwards, backwards, or to the side, lift up or fold up. It <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>that</b> the hatch covers be watertight: unsealed hatches lead to accidental cargo hold flooding, which has caused many bulkers to sink.|$|E
