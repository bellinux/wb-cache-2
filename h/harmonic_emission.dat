50|$|High {{harmonic}} generation (HHG) is the nonlinear process where intense laser radiation is converted from one fixed frequency to high harmonics of that frequency by ionization and recollision of an electron. It was first observed in 1987 by McPherson et al. who successfully generated <b>harmonic</b> <b>emission</b> {{up to the}} 17th order at 248 nm in neon gas.HHG is seen by focusing an ultra-fast, high-intensity, near-IR pulse into a noble gas at intensities of (1013-1014 W/cm2) and it generates coherent pulses in the XUV to Soft X-ray (100-1 nm) region of the spectrum. It is realizable on a laboratory scale (table-top systems) as opposed to large free electron-laser facilities.|$|E
50|$|A static VAR {{compensator}} {{can also}} be used for voltage stability. However, a STATCOM has better characteristics than an SVC. When the system voltage drops sufficiently to force the STATCOM output current to its ceiling, its maximum reactive output current will not be affected by the voltage magnitude. Therefore, it exhibits constant current characteristics when the voltage is low under the limit. In contrast the SVC's reactive output is proportional to the square of the voltage magnitude. This makes the provided reactive power decrease rapidly when voltage decreases, thus reducing its stability. In addition, the speed of response of a STATCOM is faster than that of an SVC and the <b>harmonic</b> <b>emission</b> is lower, however STATCOMs typically exhibit higher losses and may be more expensive than SVCs, so the (older) SVC technology is still widespread.|$|E

It is found that grid stabilization of the plasma column has very little effect on the emission spectrum. Measurements of the shape and location of the <b>harmonic</b> <b>emission</b> lines are described in detail. On the basis of a microwave interferometer measurement of the electron density, it is concluded that the existence of a hybrid layer somewhere on the plasma column is a necessary condition for the observation of <b>harmonic</b> <b>emission.</b> The relaxation time and the cathode voltage dependence of the <b>harmonic</b> <b>emission</b> are investigated using a pulse modulation technique. It is found that the emission intensity increases rapidly with the magnitude of the cathode voltage and that the relaxation time decreases with increasing neutral gas pressure. High intensity nonharmonic radiation is observed and identified as resulting from a beam-plasma wave instability thereby eliminating the same instability as a possible source of the <b>harmonic</b> <b>emission.</b> It is found that the collective experimental results are in reasonable agreement with the single particle electrostatic radiation theory of Canobbio and Croci. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for sustainable energy {{is one of}} the driving forces behind the increasing use of wind power by means of wind-turbines in electric power systems. Modern wind turbines commonly employ variable-speed-generator technology associated with a power-electronic converter as part of the grid connection. A drawback of the use of power electronics is the presence of <b>harmonic</b> <b>emissions.</b> Consequently a systematic study on distortion from wind power installations is needed; this holds for individual wind turbines as well for complete installations. In the work, measurements and analysis of <b>harmonic</b> <b>emissions</b> were performed on a number of wind-turbines in several wind parks in Northern Sweden. The measurements on the individual wind turbines reveal that the <b>harmonic</b> <b>emissions</b> are different from each other, even for different turbines from the same manufacturer. However in general the characteristic harmonics dominate the <b>harmonic</b> <b>emissions.</b> Furthermore, a long-term measurement shows that the dominant frequencies in the emission change with time. The total emission from a wind park into the public grid is determined by the emission from individual turbines and by the properties of the wind park. To study the impact of the wind park on the propagation a ``transfer function'' method has been introduced, and applied by means of calculation and simulation. The method is based on a mathematical model that predicts the harmonic propagation from the wind turbines to the public grid in the frequency range up to 50 kHz. Applying the model to three example parks reveals that, the amplitudes at the resonance frequency are strongly dependent on the resistance of both underground cables and transformer, especially at high frequencies. In other words, the higher order harmonics are damped a lot. In conclusion, wind park <b>harmonic</b> <b>emissions</b> into the public grid are due to the combination of emission from individual wind turbines and the propagation through the collection grid.

40|$|High {{harmonic}} generation (HHG) is understood through a three-step model. A strong laser field ionizes an atom or molecule. The free electron propagates in the laser field and may recombine with the atom or molecule {{leading to the}} generation of extreme ultraviolet or soft x-ray light at odd harmonics of the fundamental. Since the wavelength of the recombining electron is {{on the order of}} internuclear distances in molecules, HHG acts as a probe of molecular structure and dynamics. Conversely, control of the molecules leads to control of the properties (intensity, phase, and polarization) of the <b>harmonic</b> <b>emission.</b> Rotationally exciting molecules provides field-free molecular alignment at time intervals corresponding to fractions of the rotational period of the molecule. Alignment is necessary for understanding how the <b>harmonic</b> <b>emission</b> depends on molecular structure and alignment. Additionally, HHG acts as a probe of the rotational wavepackets. This thesis reports three experiments on HHG from rotationally excited molecules. Before we can use HHG as a probe of complex molecular dynamics or control harmonic properties through molecules, the <b>harmonic</b> <b>emission</b> from aligned, linear molecules must first be understood. To that end, the first experiment measures the intensity and phase of harmonics generated from N 2 O and N 2 near times of strong alignment revealing interferences during recombination. The second experiment demonstrates HHG as a sensitive probe of rotational wavepacket dynamics in CO 2 and N 2 O, revealing new revival features not detected by any other probe.
