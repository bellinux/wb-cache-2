Here, we study such rapid accretion of the primordial gas on to intermediate-mass (10 ^ 2 - 10 ^ 5 M_sun) BHs under anisotropic radiation feedback. We perform two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations that solve the flow structure across the Bondi radius, from far outside of the Bondi radius down to a central part which is larger than a circum-BH accretion disc. The radiation from the unresolved circum-BH disc is analytically modeled considering self-shadowing effect. We show that the flow settles into a steady state, where the flow structure consists of two distinct parts: (1) bipolar ionized outflowing regions, where the gas is pushed outward by thermal gas pressure and super-Eddington radiation pressure, and (2) an equatorial neutral <b>inflowing</b> <b>region,</b> where the gas falls toward the central BH without affected by radiation feedback. The resulting accretion rate {{is much higher than}} {{that in the case of}} isotropic radiation, far exceeding the Eddington-limited rate to reach a value slightly lower than the Bondi one. The opening angle of the equatorial <b>inflowing</b> <b>region</b> is determined by the luminosity and directional dependence of the central radiation. We find that photoevaporation from its surfaces set the critical opening angle of about ten degrees below which the accretion to the BH is quenched. We suggest that the shadowing effect allows even stellar-remnant BHs to grow rapidly enough to become high-redshift supermassive BHs.

The calculations involve either proton or oxygen additions in the <b>inflow</b> <b>region,</b> initially located at two distances from the current sheet. Protons are found to be much more tightly coupled into the evolution of the reconnecting system and, therefore, they effect an immediate slowdown of the reconnection process, as soon as the flux tubes they reside on become involved. Oxygen, on the other hand, has, within the limits of the calculations, a much less pronounced effect on the reconnection electric field. The difference is attributed to the lack of tight coupling to the magnetic field of the oxygen populations.

40|$|Relativistic Sweet-Parker type {{magnetic}} reconnection is {{investigated by}} relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamic (RRMHD) simulations. As an initial setting, we assume anti-parallel magnetic fields and a spatially uniform resistivity. A perturbation {{imposed on the}} magnetic fields triggers magnetic reconnection around a current sheet, and the plasma inflows into the reconnection region. The inflows are then heated due to ohmic dissipation in the diffusion region, and finally become relativistically hot outflows. The outflows are not accelerated to ultra-relativistic speeds (i. e., Lorentz factor ~ 1), even when the magnetic energy dominates the thermal and rest mass energies in the <b>inflow</b> <b>region.</b> Most of the magnetic energy in the <b>inflow</b> <b>region</b> is converted into the thermal energy of the outflow during the reconnection process.

40|$|Flow {{vorticity}} is {{a fundamental}} property of turbulent convection in rotating systems. Solar supergranules exhibit a preferred sense of rotation, which depends on the hemisphere. This {{is due to the}} Coriolis force acting on the diverging horizontal flows. We aim to spatially resolve the vertical flow vorticity of the average supergranule at different latitudes, both for outflow and <b>inflow</b> <b>regions.</b> To measure the vertical vorticity, we use two independent techniques: time-distance helioseismology (TD) and local correlation tracking of granules in intensity images (LCT) using data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Both maps are corrected for center-to-limb systematic errors. We find that 8 -h TD and LCT maps of vertical vorticity are highly correlated at large spatial scales. Associated with the average supergranule outflow, we find tangential (vortical) flows that reach about 10 m/s in the clockwise direction at 40 latitude. In average <b>inflow</b> <b>regions,</b> the tangential flow reaches the same magnitude, but in the anti-clockwise direction. These tangential velocities are much smaller than the radial (diverging) flow component (300 m/s for the average outflow and 200 m/s for the average inflow). The results for TD and LCT as measured from HMI are in excellent agreement for latitudes between - 60 and 60. From HMI LCT, we measure the vorticity peak of the average supergranule to have a full width at half maximum of about 13 Mm for outflows and 8 Mm for inflows. This is larger than the spatial resolution of the LCT measurements (about 3 Mm). On the other hand, the vorticity peak in outflows is about half the value measured at inflows (e. g. 4 /(10 ^ 6 s) clockwise compared to 8 /(10 ^ 6 s) anti-clockwise at 40 latitude).

Sorption experiments indicate that the equilibrium P concentration is 0. 19 ± 0. 07 μM. Particle size is correlated with sediment P; coarse sediment contains and sorbs much less extractable P than fine sediment does. Measurements of water samples indicate that sediment resuspension probably releases P from sediment to overlying water during base flow, but the effect during floods is less clear.

It is shown that this offers solutions to a number of paradoxes and problems that arise if the LLBL and BPS precipitations are thought of as being on closed field lines.

We study {{the correlations between}} fluid divergence and vorticity, and that between vorticity (kinetic helicity) and magnetic field. We find that the vorticity (kinetic helicity) around small-scale fields exhibits a hemispherical pattern (in sign) similar to that followed by the magnetic helicity of large-scale active regions (containing sunspots). We identify this pattern to {{be a result of}} the Coriolis force acting on supergranular-scale flows (both the outflows and inflows), and is consistent with earlier studies using local helioseismology. Further, we show that the magnetic fields cause transfer of vorticity from supergranular <b>inflow</b> <b>regions</b> to outflow regions, and that they tend to suppress the vortical motions around them when magnetic flux densities exceed about 300 G (HMI).

40|$|Abstract. In various space plasma environments, {{like the}} solar corona, Earth’s {{magnetopause}} {{or in the}} magnetotail, magnetic reconnection can be observed. During the reconnection process, magnetic energy is converted into plasma energy, which is of crucial importance for the plasma and magnetic field environment. Due to the fact, that nature shows impulsive and burst-like energy release, time dependent reconnection is a suitable approach to describe this phenomena. The steady-state model proposed by Petschek is understood as a border-case for time-dependent reconnection. In this time-dependent reconnection model, the shocks bound the outflow region and propagate with the outflowing plasma in opposite directions after reconnection ceased. In general, the reconnection X-line is assumed as stationary. Various spacecraft observations in Earth’s magnetotail give raise to the assumption of a tailward directed motion of the reconnection line. Due to this observations, a model for non-steady X-line behavior {{as an extension of}} the time-dependent model of Petschek magnetic reconnection is presented. The behavior of the shock, as well as the magnetic field structure are discussed. Examining the shock structure, a strong asymmetry in the shape appears between opposite propagating shocks, depending on the velocity of the X-line. The magnetic field inside the outflow regions also exhibits this asymmetry by comparing the magnetic field inside opposite moving outflow regions. For the magnetic field evaluated in the <b>inflow</b> <b>regions,</b> the typical bipolar behavior around each shock is maintained and asymmetry in the field strength appears too...|$|R
