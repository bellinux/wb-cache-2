5|$|Commercial sealing was {{historically}} <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> the whaling industry. Exploited species included harp seals, hooded seals, Caspian seals, elephant seals, walruses and {{all species}} of fur seal. The scale of seal harvesting decreased substantially after the 1960s, after the Canadian government reduced {{the length of}} the hunting season and implemented measures to protect adult females. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, Antarctic fur seals may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting. The northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on Guadalupe Island. It has since recolonized much of its historic range, but has a population bottleneck. Conversely, the Mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea and northwest Africa, and only remains in the northeastern Mediterranean and some parts of northwest Africa.|$|E

Marshall Plan aid allowed the nations of Western Europe to relax austerity measures and rationing, reducing discontent and bringing political stability. The communist influence on Western Europe was greatly reduced, and throughout the region communist parties faded in popularity {{in the years after}} the Marshall Plan. The trade relations fostered by the Marshall Plan helped forge the North Atlantic alliance that would persist throughout the Cold War.

Accordingly, on 20 October 1926, he filed his petition to the directors of the university {{for the establishment of a}} fundamentally different, modern Department of Pedagogy and Psychology. György Málnási Bartók, the Professor of the Department of Philosophy, was an avid supporter of the petition, since the tuition of Psychology had been the responsibility of his department at that period. In his petition, Imre Sándor listed the following fields and branches as belonging to the new Department's sphere of competence: General Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Psychology of Differences, Education of Backward Children, Psychotechnics, and Pedagogical Somatology.|$|E

A day after the election, Poe was announced as among the winners with her having the highest number of votes. She was officially proclaimed a senator by the COMELEC board on May 2013, along with fellow Team PNoy candidates Chiz Escudero, Sonny Angara, Alan Peter Cayetano, and Loren Legarda, as well United Nationalist Alliance candidate Nancy Binay (who did not attend, opting instead to send her lawyer to represent her).|$|E

500|$|Blues {{had been}} around a long time before it became a part of the first {{explosion}} of recorded popular music in American history. This came in the 1920s, when classic female blues singers like Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith and Mamie Smith grew very popular; the first hit of this field was Mamie Smith's [...] "Crazy Blues". [...] These urban blues singers changed the idea of popular music from being simple songs that could be easily performed by anyone to works primarily associated with an individual singer.

She was determined to work with other activists to put a halt to both racism and sexism. Murray's speech, [...] "Jim Crow and Jane Crow", delivered in Washington, D.C. in 1964, sheds light on the long struggle of African-American women for racial equality and their later fight for equality among the sexes. Pauli Murray ultimately helped advance the American Civil Rights Movement by letting her audience know that women's rights were <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> civil rights.|$|E
500|$|The {{staff of}} Parks and Recreation {{conceived}} {{the idea that}} Ron Swanson had his birthdate redacted from all government documents early {{in the development of}} the series, and it eventually developed into the subplot featured in [...] "Eagleton" [...] where Leslie finds out about his birthday and plans a surprise for him. Michael Schur, co-creator of the series, said the scene when Leslie surprises Ron with a quiet evening alone was his favorite scene in the show. During the scene, Leslie and Ron declare their mutual admiration for one another. Schur said it was difficult to make such an outwardly emotional scene effective in a comedy, but he believed it ultimately worked because of Amy Poehler and Nick Offerman's strong performances. Poehler said of the scene: [...] "It's really sweet and it's just an example of how it's important to Leslie who she works with. It's <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> the job itself.

When he opened the London armory he posted a 14-foot sign on the roof across from Parliament reading [...] "Colonel Colt's Pistol Factory" [...] as a publicity stunt which created a stir in the British press. Eventually the British government forced him to take down this sign. Colt historian Herbert Houze wrote that Colt championed the concept of modernism before the word was coined, he pioneered the use of celebrity endorsements to promote his products, he introduced the adjective [...] "new and improved" [...] to advertising and demonstrated the commercial value of brand-name recognition as the word for [...] "revolver" [...] in French is Le Colt. Barbara M. Tucker, professor of history {{and director of the}} Center for Connecticut Studies at Eastern Connecticut State University, wrote that Colt's marketing techniques transformed the firearm from a utilitarian object into a central symbol of American identity. Tucker added that Colt tied his revolvers to American patriotism, freedom and individualism while asserting America's technological supremacy over Europe's.|$|E

Given the clearly lower overall impacts for pumped hydropower storage, it appears advisable that these results and others like these are being fed into the public debate. Nevertheless, {{it has to be}} also recognised that the somewhat abstract nature of the numerical results for LCA indicators will have to compete against the concern for visible, tangible, and well-loved local flora, fauna, and landscapes.

This scientific synthesis altered {{the tenor of the}} debate over this iconic species, contributing to a recognition that fire and invasion by the barred owl were <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> threats <b>as</b> timber harvest. This scientific panel recommended the development of the first Recovery Plan to be finalized for the species. However the federal planning process was marred with controversy and accusations of political interference, leading to Courtneys recall to provide transparent and independent scientific evaluations. Ultimately the panel recommended significant changes, which led to a final Recovery Plan, and the current conservation strategy which distinguishes between fire-prone east-side forests and moister west-side forests. The shooting of barred owls to save spotted owls remains controversial.|$|R
