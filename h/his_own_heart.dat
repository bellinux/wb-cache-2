5|$|The {{death of}} his father due to heart {{problems}} at the age of 49 had a lasting effect on Henderson. He was conscious of his own health, and survived a blockage in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>heart</b> that was discovered in 2004. He was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 2009. The disease prevented him from attending 40th anniversary celebrations of the Summit Series in Moscow, but he was responding well to experimental treatment as part of a clinical trial he participated in into 2013.|$|E
5|$|Finn {{begins to}} think that Ricardio is a villain, but Jake just notes that Finn is jealous. However, the two spy on Ricardio {{to see if he}} is evil or not. They see Ricardio going into a {{dumpster}} and acquiring a rope and broken bottles. Then they see him throwing the Ice King into the dumpster, so they decide to question Ricardio about being a super-villain. Finn punches Ricardio right when Bubblegum comes. Mad and upset, she takes Ricardio away. However, the Ice King soon crawls toward Finn and Jake, looking sickly. He reveals that Ricardio is actually <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>heart,</b> which gained sentience after the Ice King performed a failed love spell. Ricardio desires to cut out Bubblegum's heart and make it his bride.|$|E
5|$|Marcus tears out the {{hardware}} linking him to Skynet and assists John in battling the new T-800 (Model 101) Terminator (Kickinger). Marcus is soon outclassed in strength and temporarily disabled until John {{comes to his}} aid. Marcus eventually defeats the T-800, while John destroys the Skynet base by rigging together explosives. John, Marcus, Kyle, and Star are airlifted out. John though was seriously wounded during the assault with a life-threatening injury to his heart. Marcus offers <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>heart</b> for transplantation, sacrificing himself to save John. As he recovers, John radios to other Resistance fighters that, although this battle has been won, the war is still not over.|$|E
50|$|The Doctor {{leaves the}} library through a secret passage {{and finds a}} part of the TARDIS {{unaffected}} by the anti-time infection, from where he is able to converse with Zagreus. Zagreus shows him all possible alternate time lines, including universes where the Doctor plucked out one of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>hearts,</b> and tells the Doctor that he would destroy all of them if he was unleashed.|$|R

25|$|Seeking {{refuge from}} the waswās means that the seeker after refuge himself seeks God's refuge from its evil, i.e. from the evil lest it should whisper some evil {{suggestion}} into <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>heart.</b> The second meaning is that the caller to truth seeks God's {{refuge from the}} evil {{of the one who}} whispers evil suggestions into the hearts of the people against himself. It is not in his own power to approach all the people in whose hearts evil suggestions are being whispered against himself individually and remove the misunderstandings of every person. It is also not right and proper for him that he should give up his mission of inviting others to God and should devote all his tune and energy to removing the misunderstanding created by the whisperer and to answering their accusations. It is also below his dignity that he should stoop to the level of his opponents. Therefore, God has instructed the caller to truth to seek only His refuge from the evil of the wicked people, and then to attend single-mindedly to his work of invitation and mission. For it is not for him to deal with them but for God, who is Sustainer of men, King of men, God of men.|$|E
500|$|Fralic also {{described}} the character as being [...] "quixotic", who is [...] "deeply layered with arrogance and angst, imbued {{with all the}} failings and bravado that a true villain possesses, his dastardly deeds leaving him most recently responsible {{not only for the}} death of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>heart</b> donor, but for the near-death of his granddaughter Summer from peanut poisoning". She also noted that he's been jailed, thrown in a psychiatric ward and shot, had amnesia, epilepsy among other events, but [...] "like all villains worth their salt, he's survived it all and inspired respect, if not adoration". Braeden describes the character as [...] "the villain" [...] and as [...] "defensive and always self-protective", stating that he's [...] "not here to win a popularity contest". He stated that he enjoys portraying Victor [...] "more than anything", also describing him as [...] "very complex". Braeden said that [...] "he fought himself to the position he arrived at a number of years ago", and that [...] "he obviously doesn't suffer fools easily, doesn't suffer enemies easily. He wants relationships badly, but doesn't quite trust them. It's a tragic flaw in him because of his childhood." [...] The actor, comparing himself to the character, noted that he is nothing like Victor, stating: [...] "Money makes a lot of things happen for Victor. My God almighty, that's something else that I, Eric Braeden, would never do. I always confront things directly. But when that doesn't work for Victor, he gets out his wallet [...] If you are abusive to him, he will be abusive to you. No one gets away with that. I will not allow anyone to cross that line with the character." ...|$|E
500|$|The second option had European precedents, {{including}} Edward's own great-grandfather, Duke Alexander of Württemberg, {{but it had}} no {{parallel in}} British constitutional history. The prime ministers of the five Dominions (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the Irish Free State) were consulted, and the majority agreed that there was [...] "no alternative to course (3)". William Lyon Mackenzie King (Prime Minister of Canada), Joseph Lyons (Prime Minister of Australia), and J. B. M. Hertzog (Prime Minister of South Africa) opposed options 1 and 2. Mackenzie King told Edward to do [...] "what he believed in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>heart</b> was right" [...] and the Canadian government appealed to the King to put his duty before his feelings for Simpson. Governor General of Canada Lord Tweedsmuir told Buckingham Palace and Baldwin that Canadians held deep affection for the King, but also that Canadian public opinion would be outraged if Edward married a divorcee. Michael Joseph Savage (Prime Minister of New Zealand) rejected option 1 and thought that option 2 [...] "might be possible... if some solution along these lines {{were found to be}} practicable", but [...] "would be guided by the decision of the Home government". In communications with the British government, Éamon de Valera (President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State) remarked that as a Roman Catholic country, the Irish Free State did not recognise divorce. He supposed that if the British people would not accept Wallis Simpson then abdication was the only possible solution. On 24 November, Baldwin consulted the three leading opposition politicians in Britain: Leader of the Opposition Clement Attlee, Liberal leader Sir Archibald Sinclair, and Winston Churchill. Sinclair and Attlee agreed that options 1 and 2 were unacceptable, and Churchill pledged to support the government.|$|E

2500|$|At a {{hospital}} visit in 1988, {{this time to}} watch over Waylon Jennings (who was recovering from a heart attack), Jennings suggested that Cash have himself checked into the hospital for <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>heart</b> condition. Doctors recommended preventive heart surgery, and Cash underwent double bypass surgery in the same hospital. Both recovered, although Cash refused to use any prescription painkillers, fearing a relapse into dependency. Cash later claimed that during his operation, he had {{what is called a}} [...] "near death experience".|$|E
2500|$|The Tanna Devei Eliyahu {{taught that}} when God found Jacob declaring what was true, that God is God, and {{acknowledging}} this truth in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>heart,</b> God revealed God's Self {{to him at}} once, as [...] reports, [...] "God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him." [...] The Tanna Devei Eliyahu taught {{that this was an}} application of [...] "behold, your time was the time of love" [...] (that was promised to those who proved their love for God).|$|E
2500|$|Following {{completion}} of the Life of Carlyle Froude turned to travel, particularly through the British colonies, visiting South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and the West Indies. From these travels, he produced two books, Oceana, or, England and Her Colonies (1886) and The English in the West Indies (1888), which mixed personal anecdotes with Froude's thoughts on the British Empire. Froude intended, with these writings, [...] "to kindle {{in the public mind}} at home that imaginative enthusiasm for the Colonial idea of which <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>heart</b> was full.". However, these books caused great controversy, stimulating rebuttals and the coining of the term Froudacity (by Afro-Trinidadian intellectual John Jacob Thomas, who used it as the title of his book-length critique of The English in the West Indies).|$|E

2500|$|The {{events of}} the game Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance reveal that the true purpose of Organization XIII's {{formation}} is for Master Xehanort, the true incarnation of Xemnas' human form, to place pieces of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>heart</b> into the bodies of its other members, effectively transforming them into clones of Xehanort so he may use their thirteen hearts of darkness to clash with the seven hearts of light to recreate the χ-blade. They also reveal that Nobodies {{such as those in}} the Organization are capable of developing hearts of their own over time, but are deceived by Xemnas into thinking they lack hearts so they can cooperate with his plans. Though the agenda was not realized for various reasons, a new Organization XIII was founded by recruiting not only the original selves of previous Organization members who became [...] "half Xehanort" [...] (Isa and Braig) but also induct various incarnations of Xehanort himself like Xemnas and [...] "Ansem" [...] from across time itself. This gathering of Xehanort's incarnations was accomplished by a younger version of Master Xehanort granted the power of time travel by his future self, who also serves {{as a member of the}} new Organization.|$|E

500|$|A {{year after}} their arrival, the cubes start to activate, {{scanning}} information networks {{and act in}} self-defense. The Doctor fears this was a [...] "slow invasion", and goes with Amy to UNIT while Rory and Brian help at the hospital. All the cubes are now showing the same countdown timer.
