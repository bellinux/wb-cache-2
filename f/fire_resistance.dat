25|$|In England and Wales, {{the powers}} to make {{building}} regulations were consolidated and re-enacted in 1984. All building regulations {{made by the}} Secretary of State since then have included minimum fire safety measures (for both physical <b>fire</b> <b>resistance</b> and safe means of escape) for all new, extended or altered buildings.

30|$|As {{a result}} of a long period of fire exclusion, heavy accumulations of fuels in many western forests are of concern to {{managers}} and the public (Leopold et al. 1963, Towell 1969, Kilgore 1972). These altered fuel conditions can promote uncharacteristically intense and/or extensive fires that may have undesirable effects (Hartesveldt 1964, Kilgore 1972, van Wagtendonk 1985). Intense fire can increase the risk of damage to life and property in wildland-urban interface areas and lead to severe fire effects on natural resources. Also, greater intensity may increase a <b>fire’s</b> <b>resistance</b> to control, which can in turn increase the costs of fire suppression.|$|R

25|$|The {{collapse}} of the old 7 World Trade Center is remarkable {{because it was the}} first known instance of a tall building collapsing primarily as a result of uncontrolled fires. Based on its investigation, NIST reiterated several recommendations it had made in its earlier report on the {{collapse of}} the twin towers, and urged immediate action on a further recommendation: that <b>fire</b> <b>resistance</b> should be evaluated under the assumption that sprinklers are unavailable; and that the effects of thermal expansion on floor support systems be considered. Recognizing that current building codes are drawn to prevent loss of life rather than building collapse, the main point of NIST's recommendations is that buildings should not collapse from fire even if sprinklers are unavailable.|$|E
25|$|Other {{criticisms of}} UK fire {{regulations}} voiced {{in the aftermath}} of the fire include the lack of external sprinklers, mandated in Dubai and Australia for example for buildings featuring combustible cladding, the lack of internal sprinklers, which could have contained the original fire, and a 1986 change in the law under the then Conservative government that abolished a requirement that external walls should have at least one hour's <b>fire</b> <b>resistance</b> to prevent blazes from re-entering a building and spreading to other apartments. Wales has required sprinklers to be installed in new houses and flats built since 2016. A BBC Breakfast investigation, focusing on half of the UK's council owned and housing association owned tower blocks, found that 2% of them have full sprinkler systems. Deaths were 87% lower when buildings with sprinklers caught fire. England, Wales and Scotland all require sprinklers in newly built tall buildings but this does not apply retrospectively to older buildings. The same investigation found that one tower block in three has more than one staircase where people can be evacuated. The London fire chief has called for sprinklers to be retrofitted in all social housing blocks.|$|E

The wooden siege engines of the Crusaders were vulnerable to attack from the Byzantine and Muslim fire-weapons, so the troops inside siege towers kept stores of water and vinegar.|$|E
500|$|The {{history of}} the Albert Dock dates back to 1837, when Jesse Hartley first began the {{development}} of plans for a combined dock and warehouse system. The plans drawn up by Hartley and fellow civil engineer Philip Hardwick for the Albert Dock were at the time considered quite 'radical', as they envisioned the loading and unloading of ships directly from the warehouses. However, this idea was not new, and {{as far back as}} the 1803 Warehousing Act, legislation had been passed to allow this form of development to occur, whilst the concept was first actually used in the construction of St Katharine's Dock in London, which was opened in 1828. As part of the development process, Hartley was eager to test the <b>fire</b> <b>resistance</b> of any particular design by constructing an [...] by [...] dummy structure, filling it with timber and tar, and setting it alight. After testing several structural designs he settled on the combination of cast iron, brick, sandstone and granite. The design was submitted for planning permission in 1839 although it wasn't until 1841, when the bill authorising the design of the dock was eventually passed by Parliament, that construction was allowed to begin.|$|E

40|$|Fire blight, {{caused by}} the {{bacterium}} Erwinia amylovora (Burrill) Winslow et al., {{is one of the}} most serious diseases of pear. The development of pear cultivars with a durable resistance is extremely important for effective control of fire blight and is a key objective of most pear breeding programs throughout the world. We phenotyped seedlings from the interspecific pear population PEAR 3 (PremP 003, P. x bretschneideri x P. communis) x 'Moonglow' (P. communis) for <b>fire</b> blight <b>resistance</b> at two different geographic locations, in France and New Zealand, respectively, employing two local E. amylovora isolates. Using a genetic map constructed with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and microsatellite (SSR) markers previously developed for this segregating population, we detected a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on linkage group (LG) 2 of 'Moonglow' (R- 2 = 12. 9 - 34. 4 %), which was stable in both environments. We demonstrated that this QTL co-localizes with another major QTL for <b>fire</b> blight <b>resistance</b> previously detected in 'Harrow Sweet' and that the two favorable (i. e., resistant) alleles were not identical by descent.
