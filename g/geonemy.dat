40|$|On the {{presence}} of Catops subfuscus Kellner, 1846 in the Pyrenees (Coleoptera, Leiodidae, Cholevinae, Catopini) We provide new distribution data for Catops subfuscus Kellner, 1846. We update the <b>geonemy</b> of the species and, based on recent data, we confirm its presence in the subterranean environment {{on both sides of}} the Pyrenean massif. Illustrations of the aedeagus and a distribution map are provided...|$|E

40|$|New {{data on the}} {{distribution}} of several species of the genus Stygiophyes Fresneda 1998 (S. aldomai, S. latebricola, S. latebricola elongatus, S. puncticollis, S. saforensis and S. sanctigervasd are presented. The new localities reported include both caves and superficial underground compartments (MSS). Some taxonomic notes regarding the species Stygiophyes aldomai, Stygiophyes ribagorzanus, and Stygiophyes zariquieyi ("bona species") are also included. A new subspecies is described, Stygiophyes aldomai allomorphus n. ssp., with material from two localities in Pont de Suert, and one in Vall de Boí (Lleida). Stygiophyes latrunculus is transferred to the genus Speonomites. The colonisation processes that could have resulted in the present distribution of the species of the genus are discussed.

40|$|In 1971 I {{began to}} study the few {{specimens}} of Staphylinidae from Turkey who came from the collections made by colleagues, in particu-lar of the Museum of Zoology of Rome University “Sapienza ” and of the Museum of Natural History of Verona and Geneva. Since then, I started to prepare a Catalogue of the species in that region. After so many years I can now publish this list {{in the hope of}} contributing to better knowledge of Staphylinidae {{of one of the most}} interesting zoogeographical area of the Mediterranean. After the species is given the author’s name and year of publication. Within individual genera, the species are listed in alphabetical order, in the traditional order. Of each species are provided with the geonemical known data, fol-lowed, in brackets, by the author of such citations. If the species is de-scribed from Cyprus and/or Turkey, is started, if known, where is pre-served the type, whether it is ♂ or ♀ or if the sex is not started in descrip-tion (§) and is reported if it was designated the lectotype and the author of the designation. Is specified if the writer has examined specimens of the species, indicating the location and istitutions where the specimens are preserved. The “Distribution ” follows the list of regions known for that species, usually taken from Herman, 2001 or Smetana, 2004 and is given a chorological category if verifyed and easily deduced from <b>geonemy.</b> The chorologic “endemic ” category is based on current knowledge and is not intended to be definitive. Are also included species mentioned by some authors but whose presence in Cyprus and/or Turkey is not certifyed. In this case, the above quote is followed by the words “to be confirmed”...|$|E
