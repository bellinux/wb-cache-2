[...] Known for <b>her</b> <b>long</b> <b>legs</b> and {{attractive}} appearance, she regularly clashed with Gladys over Jeffrey Fairbrother. Sylvia was a qualified swimming instructor, and enjoyed flirting with both Jeffrey Fairbrother and Clive Dempster. Out of all the female Yellowcoats, Gladys disliked Sylvia the most. She won the most popular girl Yellowcoat competition during the 1959 season, the winner {{of which would be}} given the chance to work at a new Maplin camp in the Bahamas. She believed she had beaten Gladys {{for the first time in}} five years – she did not know that the vote was in fact tied, and Jeffrey gave the win to Sylvia so Gladys could stay with him at the camp. However, Sylvia lost the job at the new Bahamas camp when it was destroyed in a storm shortly after her victory. The tension between her and Gladys lasted throughout both seasons, although it mellowed slightly towards the end of the 1960 season – Gladys suggested Sylvia should replace her as chief Yellowcoat when she moved to Australia. This did not materialise, however, following the modernisation of Maplins and the abolition of Yellowcoats after the 1960 season.|$|E

5000|$|Of all {{the racing}} games that litter game shop shelves, Ridge Racer has {{something}} {{none of the}} others do: Reiko Nagase.

Whatever the case, Ridge Racer is one of the few (if not the only) racing games with character, both figuratively and literally.
