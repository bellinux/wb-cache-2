40|$|Background. Enteroscopy plays a {{key role}} in the {{post-operative}} monitoring of patients with small bowel transplantation for the early detection of post-transplant complications and for the assessment of the graft's integrity. Routine surveillance enteroscopies (trans-stomal terminal <b>ileoscopy</b> or jejunoscopy) are invasive, may be unsafe in frail patients, and only allow incomplete exploration of the transplanted graft, which may be unsatisfactory, since the distribution of the lesions is often patchy or segmental. Aims. To evaluate the potential of capsule enteroscopy, a new, minimally invasive technique which allows complete exploration of the small bowel, in small bowel transplant recipients. Methods. Five small bowel transplanted patients underwent capsule enteroscopy with the GIVEN(R) endoscopy system. The results of capsule enteroscopy were compared with those of trans-stomal <b>ileoscopy.</b> Results. Capsule enteroscopy was better tolerated than <b>ileoscopy</b> and good quality images of the small bowel were obtained in four patients. The terminal ileum was normal both on <b>ileoscopy</b> and capsule enteroscopy. Mucosal changes in segments not reached by <b>ileoscopy</b> were detected by capsule enteroscopy in three of four patients. Conclusions. Capsule enteroscopy is better tolerated than <b>ileoscopy,</b> allows complete exploration of the transplanted graft and can detect mucosal changes in segments not reached by <b>ileoscopy.</b> (C) 2003 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S. r. l.

40|$|Utilization of {{endoscopy}} to both visualize and selectively biopsy an intestinal allograft {{has become}} the standard for early recognition and treatment of intestinal allograft rejection. Despite the widespread acceptance {{of the need for}} selective mucosal biopsies, it has not been shown that the histological features of intestinal allograft rejection are either localized or occur as part of a more diffuse phenomenon within a tubular allograft. To resolve these issues, 88 <b>ileoscopies</b> were performed in 12 small-bowel allograft recipients and mucosal biopsy samples were obtained at 5, 10, and 15 cm, respectively, from the ileal stoma. Each mucosal biopsy was labeled, processed, and evaluated individually for the presence and severity of any evidence for allograft rejection. The data obtained suggest that intestinal allograft rejection is a diffuse process, and biopsies obtained randomly from an ileal graft are likely to demonstrate evidence of allograft rejection when such is present. © 1994 Springer-Verlag New York Inc...|$|R
40|$|Carcinoid {{tumors are}} {{the most common type of}} small bowel tumor, and the {{incidence}} is rising. The majority of small bowel carcinoid tumors arise within 60 cm of the ileocecal valve. The addition of <b>ileoscopy</b> to screening colonoscopy can detect asymptomatic small bowel carcinoid tumors and improve long-term prognosis through early surgical resection. <b>Ileoscopy</b> is a brief procedure with a high success rate and minimal complications beyond those of colonoscopy. The use of <b>ileoscopy</b> during screening colonoscopy has led to an increase in the early-stage detection of locoregional small bowel carcinoid tumors that can be completely treated with surgery alone, and as such has improved long-term prognosis in these patients. Five asymptomatic Caucasian patients, 3 males and 2 females, from 53 to 70 years old (mean age, 60 years old), were diagnosed with locoregional ileal carcinoids during routine colonoscopy with <b>ileoscopy.</b> Since having an ileocolectomy and without adjuvant treatment, no patient has developed tumor recurrence over a follow-up period of one and half to 12 and a half years. The early detection of carcinoid tumors by <b>ileoscopy</b> during screening colonoscopy can lead to increased long-term survival in patients with locally invasive disease. The high success rate and brief duration of the procedure, in addition to the lack of associated morbidity and mortality suggest that with further studies, routine <b>ileoscopy</b> during colonoscopy may be promising in the diagnosis of small bowel carcinoid tumors...|$|E

40|$|Eighty-nine {{patients}} who had been treated by ileal resection for Crohn's disease between 1979 and 1984 were included in a prospective cohort follow up to study the natural course of early postoperative lesions. Recurrent lesions were observed endoscopically in the neoterminal ileum within 1 year of surgery in 73 % of the patients, although only 20 % of the patients had symptoms. Three years after surgery, the endoscopic recurrence rate had increased to 85 % and symptomatic recurrence occurred in 34 %. The ultimate course of the disease was best predicted by {{the severity of the}} early postoperative lesions, as observed at <b>ileoscopy.</b> Clinical parameters that influenced outcome were preoperative disease activity, the indication for surgery, and the number of surgical resections. When patients were stratified for preoperative disease activity, the severity of lesions found at endoscopy remained a strong predictive factor for symptomatic recurrence. In 22 other patients submitted to "curative" ileal resection and ileocolonic anastomosis, the segment to be used as neoterminal ileum was carefully examined during surgery, and two large biopsies were taken before making the anastomosis. An <b>ileoscopy</b> was performed 6 months after surgery. Although all patients had a macroscopically normal neoterminal ileum and 19 had entirely normal biopsies at the time of surgery, 21 patients were found at <b>ileoscopy</b> to have developed ileitis involving a 15 -cm segment (range, 4 - 30 cm), and 20 had unequivocal microscopic lesions on biopsies. These studies suggest that early lesions in the neoterminal ileum after Crohn's resection do not originate from microscopic inflammation present in this bowel segment at the time of surgery. The early postoperative lesions in the neoterminal ileum seem to be a suitable model to study the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and also to evaluate new therapeutic modalities, either to prevent development of these early lesions or to treat progressive recurrence. status: publishe...|$|E

Fasting ileal motility was increased slightly by stomal occlusion, although intestinal transit during feeding was not altered. Also, ileal absorption of glucose, electrolytes, vitamin B- 12, and fat were not changed, and ileal mucosa {{at the site of}} occlusion remained intact endoscopically. The authors concluded that chronic intermittent occlusion of a Brooke ileostomy with an indwelling stomal device achieved enteric continence without impairing intestinal function...|$|E
40|$|The ileum is {{approximately}} the most distal three-fifths {{of the small}} intestine and {{is responsible for the}} digestion and the absorption of foods. The diagnosis of diseases that affects this segment can be achieved by clinical evaluation and complementary examinations. Not only does ileocolonoscopy allow macroscopical analysis, but also enables biopsies to be carried out for histological evaluation. Only three publications about the description of the endoscopic characteristics of the terminal ileum have been found in the literature. Even so, there have not been found descriptions or classifications in publications that mentioned endoscopic aspect of the terminal ileum, being reported only as normal ileum. Therefore, this strengthens the idea of the lack of knowledge or the non-acceptance of these descriptions and these classifications by the scientific community. Endoscopic aspects of this segment when affected by several diseases vary from normal endoscopically ileum to cases when the macroscopical examination demonstrate specific features of these illnesses. In the present investigation, there are doubts about the need of biopsy of this segment in patients with normal <b>ileoscopy.</b> Moreover, few studies with criteria for macroscopical and microscopical characterization of the ileum were found...|$|E
40|$|Patients with Crohn's {{disease and}} colonic {{inflammation}} that proves refractory to medical therapy often require a proctocolectomy and end ileostomy. Disease recurrence can occur despite {{creation of an}} end ileostomy and may lead to peristomal complications such as fistula formation, abscesses, stoma retraction, or strictures. We present {{the case of a}} 51 -year-old man with medically refractory ileocolonic Crohn's disease who underwent a proctocolectomy with end ileostomy. The disease course was complicated by recurrence of ileal Crohn's disease despite biological therapy. The patient presented with peristomal complications including an enterocutaneous fistula, stoma retraction, and an ileal stricture necessitating surgical revision of the ileostomy. Review of literature confirms an approximately 30 % risk of recurrence of Crohn's disease after an end ileostomy. A penetrating phenotype and preexisting ileal disease are risk factors for disease recurrence. A thorough evaluation of the stoma/peristomal area and evaluation of the small bowel by <b>ileoscopy</b> and small bowel imaging are required to assess the extent of disease and extraluminal complications such as stomal retraction and fistulas that require further surgical intervention. While postoperative medical treatment with immunosuppression or biological therapy is often employed, these therapies are unproven to prevent postoperative recurrence in the setting of a stoma...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} role of {{retrograde}} terminal ileosco-py in hematochezia patients with normal colonoscopy. METHODS: Between January 1997 and March 2005, 39 hematochezia patients (males 36, females 3, mean age 44. 7 years) with a reported normal colonoscopy underwent a repeat colonoscopy. After reaching the cecum, {{attempt was made to}} localize the ileocecal valve and intubate the terminal ileum. Any abnormal-ity in the mucosa of the terminal ileum was carefully recorded and biopsies were obtained from suspicious-looking lesions. RESULTS: During the study period there were 39 patients admitted for hematochezia in whom colonos-copy till cecum did not reveal any abnormality. Full-length colonoscopy till the cecum could be performed in all the patients. The terminal ileum could be intu-bated in 36 patients. No abnormality was noted in 31 patients. Ileal ulcers were noted in two patients. Nodularity along with ulceration of the ileal mucosa, a Dieulafoy’s lesion, and an angiomatous malformation were noted in one patient each. Histological examina-tion of the biopsies obtained from the ulcers revealed typical tuberculous lesion in the patient with nodular-ity and ulceration. One of the patients had typhoid ulcers and another had non-specifi c ulcers. CONCLUSION: Retrograde terminal <b>ileoscopy</b> gives limited but valuable information, in patients with hema-tochezia and should be attempted in all such patients...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} capsule endoscopy in patients with persistent perianal disease and negative conventional work up for Crohn&#x 2019;s disease (CD). METHODS: Patients with perianal disease (abscesses, fistulas, recurrent fissures) were evaluated for underlying CD. Patients who had a negative work up, defined as a negative colonoscopy with a normal <b>ileoscopy</b> or a normal small bowel series or a normal CT/MR enterography, underwent a Pillcam study of the small bowel after signing informed consent. Patients using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or who {{had a history of}} inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatic disease were excluded. RESULTS: We recruited 26 patients aged 21 - 61 years (average 35. 6 years), 17 males and 9 females. One case could not be evaluated since the capsule did not leave the stomach. In 6 of 25 (24 %) patients with a negative standard work up for Crohn's disease, capsule endoscopy (CE) findings were consistent with Crohn's disease of the small bowel. Family history of CD, white blood cell, hemoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein did not predict a diagnosis of CD. Capsule endoscopy findings led to a change in treatment. CONCLUSION: In patients with perianal disease and a negative conventional work up to exclude CD, CE leads to incremental diagnostic yield of 24 %...|$|E
40|$|Ehlers-Danlos {{syndrome}} (EDS) is a {{group of}} inherited connective tissue disorders caused by collagen synthesis defects. EDS type IV, or vascular EDS, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the type III pro-collagen gene (COL 3 A 1). Common complications of EDS type IV include gastrointestinal bleeding and bowel perforations, posing diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas for both surgeons and gastroenterologists. Here, we describe a complicated case of EDS type IV in a 35 -year-old caucasian female who presented with overt gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient had a prior history of spontaneous colonic perforation, and an uncomplicated upper endoscopy was performed. A careful <b>ileoscopy</b> was terminated early due to tachycardia and severe abdominal pain, and a subsequent computed tomography scan confirmed the diagnosis of ileal perforation. The patient was managed conservatively, and demonstrated daily improvement. At the time of hospital discharge, no further episodes of gastrointestinal blood loss had occurred. This case highlights the benefit of conservative management for EDS patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage. It is recommended that surgical treatment should be reserved for patients who fail conservative treatment or in cases of hemodynamic instability. Finally, this case demonstrates the necessity for a higher threshold of operative or endoscopic interventions in EDS type IV patients...|$|E
40|$|Thirty five {{consecutive}} patients (15 males and 20 females, {{mean age of}} 39 ± 13 years) with pathologically proven small bowel Crohn’s disease were studied by means of he-lical single detector CT (No = 13) or multide-tector CT (No = 22), after administration of low density contrast by mouth (No = 13) or by nasojeunal tube (No = 22). The following parameters have been evalu-ated: bowel wall thickening, bowel wall en-hancement with contrast, presence of “target sign ” (bowel wall stratification), of perienteric stranding, of “comb sign”, of fibrofatty prolif-eration, and of complications (Figure 1). Eight hours later, all patients were studied with barium administered by mouth (No = 13) or with barium and methilcellulose ad-ministered by nasojeunal tube (No = 22). Clinical activity was assessed by CDAI score, and ESR, CRP, haemogram, α 1 glycoprotein and fibrinogen values were also recorded. In 21 patients, colonoscopy with retrograde <b>ileoscopy</b> and ileal biopsies for histological assessment were also performed. Statistical analysis {{has been done by}} means of Fisher’s exact test and Spearman ’ rank correlation test. Results Comparable results were obtained with the use of oral contrast versus nasojeunal tube for CT enteroclysis, as far as bowel distension is concerned.

40|$|Forty two Crohn's disease {{patients}} were followed up after ileocolic resection {{with regard to}} symptoms and endoscopic appearance of the ileocolic anastomosis. Twenty eight patients resected because of colonic neoplasm served as controls. In all the Crohn's disease patients the ileal resection margin was disease free macroscopically at operation. In addition, intraoperative <b>ileoscopy</b> was performed in 13 and no sign of residual inflammation in the neoterminal ileum was seen. Endoscopy soon after surgery often showed preanastomotic ileal ulceration before symptoms appeared, whereas no anastomotic lesions were observed in the controls. Thus, 22 of 30 Crohn's disease patients examined had ulceration of the anastomotic area after three months, but only 10 had developed symptoms indicating relapse (73 v 33 %). Corresponding figures in the 30 patients examined after one year were 93 v 37 %, and in 14 patients after three years they were 100 and 86 % respectively. The inflammatory lesions in all cases were preanastomotic, in the neoterminal ileum, and showed time related progression from aphthae to larger ulcers and stricture. The study suggests that endoscopically observed inflammatory lesions that appear soon after ileocolic resection for Crohn's disease signify new inflammation and not residual, persistent disease or incomplete anastomotic healing. The data further suggest that despite clinical remission after apparently radical intestinal resection, the bowel is permanently inflamed in Crohn's disease...|$|E
