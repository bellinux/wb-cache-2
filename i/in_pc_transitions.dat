40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the capability of}} paclitaxel, one of the taxanes, to induce death in two prostate cancer lines, LNCaP and PC 3. Paclitaxel drove an apoptotic pathway in LNCaP, but not <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> 3 cells, <b>in</b> response to G 2 /M arrest. An examination of the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins revealed that Bcl-xl was much higher <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> 3 cells than in LNCaP cells and Bcl 2 could be detected only <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> 3 cells, not in LNCaP cells. Knocking down Bcl-xl enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells, while {{we were unable to}} knock down Bcl-xl efficiently <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> 3 cells. Significantly, a comparison of ABT- 263, a specific inhibitor of Bcl 2 and Bcl-xl, with ABT- 199, a Bcl 2 selective inhibitor, disclosed that only ABT- 263, not ABT- 199, could induce apoptosis <b>in</b> LNCaP and <b>PC</b> 3 cells. The results indicate that Bcl-xl has a protective role against paclitaxel-induced apoptosis <b>in</b> LNCaP and <b>PC</b> 3 cells, and its overexpression causes the paclitaxel resistance seen <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> 3 cells. Interestingly, combined paclitaxel with ABT- 263 to treat LNCaP and PC 3 cells demonstrated synergistic apoptosis activation, indicating that ABT- 263 could enhance paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells and overcome Bcl-xl overexpression to trigger paclitaxel-induced apoptosis <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> 3 cells. We also observed that the activation of apoptosis in LNCaP cells was more efficient than <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> 3 cells <b>in</b> response to paclitaxel plus ABT- 263 or to ABT- 263 alone, suggesting that the apoptosis pathway <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> 3 cells might have further differences from that in LNCaP cells even after Bcl-xl overexpression is accounted for...|$|R

40|$|Growth factor {{stimulation}} of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway in fibroblasts is inhibited by cyclic AMP (cAMP) {{as a result of}} inhibition of Raf- 1. In contrast, cAMP inhibits neither nerve growth factor-induced MAP kinase activation nor differentiation <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> 12 pheochromocytoma cells. Instead, <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> 12 cells cAMP activates MAP kinase. Since one of the major differences between the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase cascades of these cell types is the expression of B-Raf <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> 12 cells, we compared the effects of cAMP on Raf- 1 and B-Raf. <b>In</b> <b>PC</b> 12 cells maintained in serum-containing medium, B-Raf was refractory to inhibition by cAMP, whereas Raf- 1 was effectively inhibited. In contrast, both B-Raf and Raf- 1 were inhibited by cAMP <b>in</b> serum-starved <b>PC</b> 12 cells. The effect of cAMP is thus dependent upon growth conditions, with B-Raf being resistant to cAMP inhibition in the presence of serum. These results were extended by studies of Rat- 1 fibroblasts into which B-Raf had been introduced by transfection. As <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> 12 cells, B-Raf was resistant to inhibition by cAMP in the presence of serum, whereas Raf- 1 was effectively inhibited. In addition, the expression of B-Raf rendered Rat- 1 cells resistant to the inhibitory effects of cAMP on both growth factor-induced activation of MAP kinase and mitogenesis. These results indicate that Raf- 1 and B-Raf are differentially sensitive to inhibition by cAMP and that B-Raf expression can contribute to cell type-specific differences in the regulation of the MAP kinase pathway. In contrast to the situation <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> 12 cells, cAMP by itself did not stimulate MAP kinase in B-Raf-expressing Rat- 1 cells. The activation of MAP kinase by cAMP <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> 12 cells was inhibited by the expression of a dominant negative Ras mutant, indicating that cAMP acts on a target upstream of Ras. Thus, it appears that a signaling component upstream of Ras is also require for cAMP {{stimulation of}} MAP kinase <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> 12 cells...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} the adrenergic receptors mediating the effects of norepinephrine on PC Cl 3 rat thyroid cells and identify the molecular mechanisms by which TSH regulates the noradrenergic response. We studied TSH regulation of norepinephrine-induced cytosolic calcium increase by means of the fluorescent probe fura- 2. <b>In</b> <b>PC</b> Cl 3 cells grown and maintained in a medium containing TSH (PC Cl 3 6 H), norepinephrine caused a higher increase in cytosolic calcium than <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> Cl 3 starved from TSH 5 days before the experiments (PC Cl 3 5 H). In both group of cells the calcium response to norepinephrine was concentration dependent and reduced by the removal of extracellular calcium ions. Reintroduction of TSH in the culture medium of the PC Cl 3 5 H cells induced the recovery of the norepinephrine-stimulated intracellular calcium rise similarly to that <b>in</b> the native <b>PC</b> Cl 3 6 H. This effect was complete after a 48 -h incubation period and was abolished by the simultaneous treatment of the cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, suggesting that TSH may stimulate the synthesis of alpha(1) -adrenergic receptors in PG Cl 3 cells. Because in these cells we found that TSH increased cAMP levels as well as inositol phosphate production, we tested whether the activation of a protein kinase-A and/or protein kinase-C was involved in TSH regulation of the adrenergic response. We found that the treatment of PC Cl 3 5 H cells with forskolin restored the effect of norepinephrine on the calcium level, and that KT 5720, an inhibitor of the protein kinase-A, was able to prevent the recovery of the noradrenergic response induced by the readdition of TSH to the culture medium of PC Cl 3 5 H. Conversely, treatment of PC Cl 3 5 H cells with the protein kinase-C activator phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate was ineffective. Norepinephrine also stimulated inositol phosphate production <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> Cl 3 6 H and, to a lesser extent, <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> Cl 3 5 H, but it did not affect the cAMP levels in the two groups of cells. To characterize alpha(1) -adrenergic receptor subtypes mediating the effects of norepinephrine <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> Cl 3 cells, we used antagonists of alpha(1 A) and ale receptors (WB 4101 and chlorethylclonidine respectively). Under these experimental conditions we found that 1) chlorethylclonidine caused an almost complete inhibition of the norepinephrine-induced calcium increase <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> Cl 3 6 H, whereas a partial inhibition of the norepinephrine response <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> Cl 3 5 H occurred; 2) WB 4101, at a concentration specific for alpha(1 A) receptors (0. 01 CIM), slightly reduced the effect of norepinephrine <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> Cl 3 6 H and reduced norepinephrine stimulation by 50 % <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> Cl 3 5 H; and 3) chlorethylclonidine plus WB 4101 (0. 01 mu M) completely abolished the noradrenergic response in both groups of cells. In line with the functional results, binding studies with [H- 3]prazosin showed a lower binding capacity (B-max) for alpha(1) -binding sites <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> Cl 3 5 H than <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> Cl 3 6 H. Pretreatment of PC Cl 3 cells with chlorethylclonidine reduced the specific binding for [H- 3]prazosin <b>in</b> both <b>PC</b> Cl 3 6 H and 5 H. However, <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> Cl 3 6 H, chlorethylclonidine inhibition of [H- 3]prazosin binding was higher than that <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> Cl 3 5 H (86 % and 36 %, respectively, for 2. 5 nM prazosin) ...|$|R

The greater inhibitory activity of ATO <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> 3 cells was associated with induction of autophagy in that cell line, as demonstrated by increased expression of LC 3 -II. miR- 182 was consistently upregulated by ATO <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> 3 cells, but not in LNCaP cells.
