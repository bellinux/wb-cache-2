25|$|Brokaw, Rather, and Jennings {{became the}} {{familiar}} faces of network news {{for more than}} two decades. But changes began in December 2004, when Brian Williams took over from Brokaw as anchor of NBC Nightly News, after Brokaw's well-anticipated retirement, announced in 2002.

5000|$|On {{his way to}} find <b>Elizabeth</b> and <b>Vargas,</b> Dylan {{realizes that}} Elizabeth is the real enemy and wants to turn Vargas into Belial as a revenge for her father's murder. She tells him that the reason is not revenge, instead she {{explains}} that her family - an organization of monster hunters - are the [...] "good guys" [...] and that the [...] "monsters" [...] (vampires, werewolves, zombies, etc.) must be destroyed. Dylan says that she is wrong and {{that she is the}} monster. She injects the blood into Vargas's body and escapes, but before she can do so she is attacked by Marcus who is knocked down by her. Dylan fights off Belial (who is slowly taking over <b>Vargas's</b> body) when <b>Elizabeth</b> tries to stop Belial from killing Dylan, claiming he should do as she says because she is its master. Belial states the anyone who stops him, including his master, is his enemy. After knocking her away, Belial continues after Dylan while Elizabeth escapes while Wolfgang (who was called by Dylan before the battle) and his werewolf allies attack Elizabeth. They manage to subdue and kill Elizabeth, {{and at the same time}} Belial dies in front of Dylan leaving Vargas's unconscious body. Dylan gives the heart to Wolfgang, the only one that Dylan can trust to protect it, and goes with Marcus.|$|R
25|$|Schieffer led the CBS Evening News {{to become}} the #2 evening news broadcast, ahead of ABC's World News Tonight.

When Charles Gibson was appointed as anchor of World News Tonight, ABC regained stability and momentum to regain the #2 spot.

On January 14, 2013, Roberts announced that she hoped to return to the program sometime that February; Roberts performed dry run rehearsals during the week of January 21 in preparation for her return; she and her doctors evaluated her body's reaction to the makeup, the lighting, her hair, and the number of people she comes in contact with to avoid compromising her then-gradually-improving health. Roberts returned to Good Morning America part-time on February 20, 2013; she announced in August 2013 that she would return to full-time hosting duties on September 3 of that year.|$|E
