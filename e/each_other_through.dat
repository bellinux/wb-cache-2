5|$|A {{study of}} short-finned pilot whales off the {{southwest}} coast of Tenerife in the Canary Islands {{has found the}} members of a pod maintained contact with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>through</b> call repertoires unique to their pod. A later study found, when foraging at around 800 m deep, short-finned pilot whales make tonal calls. The number and length of the calls seem to decrease with depth despite being farther away from conspecifics at the surface. As such, the surrounding water pressure affects the energy of the calls, but it does not appear to affect the frequency levels.|$|E
5|$|Berge and Brundtland were {{introduced}} to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>through</b> a mutual friend in Tromsø, Norway. They enjoyed the same films and music, and shared an interest in electronics. The two experimented with various forms of electronic music, and bought a drum machine together during the Tromsø techno scene before going their separate ways. Several years later, the two met up again and formed Röyksopp during the Bergen Wave. After experimenting with different genres of electronic music, the band solidified {{their place in the}} electronica scene with their 2001 debut album, Melody A.M., released on the Wall of Sound record label.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} {{coherence}} was only {{introduced into the}} metric system {{in the third quarter}} of the 19th century; in its original form the metric system was non-coherent—in particular the litre was 0.001m3 and the are (from which the hectare derives) was 100m2. However the units of mass and length were related to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>through</b> the physical properties of water, the gram having been designed as being the mass of one cubic centimetre of water at its freezing point.|$|E

Within four days Arnhem was totally under Allied control, allowing the Canadians to advance further into the Netherlands. Less than {{two weeks after the}} battle a general truce brought major combat operations in the country to an end and on 5 May the German commander in chief in the Netherlands surrendered to the Canadian Army. Three days later Germany unconditionally surrendered, bringing the war in Europe to a close.|$|E
5|$|While the Myrmica ant colony can {{identify}} <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>through</b> chemical signaling, social ranks are partially determined by sound acoustics. Therefore, once the P. rebeli begin {{to mimic the}} sound of the queen ant, the worker ants begin to treat the P. rebeli {{as if it were the}} queen ant. On the other hand, the queen ant treats the P. rebeli larvae and pupae as if they were rivals, as she is the only one in the colony that recognizes that the P. rebeli larvae is not ant larvae.|$|E

5|$|After Flower was {{released}} to critical praise and awards, Chen and Thatgamecompany {{moved on to}} their next game, Journey. Journey was intended by Chen {{to focus on the}} element of communication and social interaction in video games. Since in most games the communication between players is focused on specific goals, in Journey Chen intended for the player to be able to either play alone or to come across other players, but not be able to communicate with them directly. Instead, players have to build relationships with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>through</b> their actions, helping each other or leaving as they choose. Journey {{was released}} on the PlayStation Network on March 13, 2012, and has received critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|Every Deshastha {{family has}} their own family patron deity or the Kuladaivat. This deity is common to a lineage or a clan of several {{families}} who are connected to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>through</b> a common ancestor. The Khandoba of Jejuri {{is an example of}} a Kuladaivat of some Maharashtrian Deshastha families; he is a common Kuladaivat to several castes ranging from Brahmins to Dalits. The practice of worshiping local or territorial deities as Kuladaivats began in the period of the Yadava dynasty. Other family deities of the people of Maharashtra are Bhavani of Tuljapur, Mahalaxmi of Kolhapur, Mahalaxmi of Amravati, Renuka of Mahur, Parashuram in Konkan, Saptashringi on Saptashringa hill at Vani in Nasik district. Despite being the most popular deity amongst Deshastha and other Marathi people, very few families regard Vitthal or other popular Avatars of Vishnu such as Rama or Krishna as their Kuldaivat, with Balaji being an exception.|$|E
5|$|The Ravens {{first met}} the New England Patriots in 1996, but the rivalry truly started in 2007 when the Ravens {{suffered}} a bitter 27–24 {{loss in the}} Patriots' quest for perfection. The rivalry began to escalate in 2009 when the Ravens lost to the Patriots 27–21 {{in a game that}} involved a confrontation between Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs. Both players would go on to take verbal shots at <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>through</b> the media after the game. The Ravens defeated the Patriots in the 2009 AFC Wild Card playoff game, 33–14.

5|$|The allied {{objective}} was to encircle Humaitá and force its capitulation by siege. On 15 August 1867, under heavy fire, Brazilian warships forced the passage of Curupayty, an outer line of defense of Humaitá. Joaquim Inácio commanded from {{the bridge of the}} ironclad Brasil, which engaged in the operation. Joaquim Inácio was afterwards awarded the noble title of Barão de Inhaúma (Baron of Inhaúma) on 27 September. The name came from Inhaúma, a region (now a neighborhood) near the city of Rio de Janeiro. His wife had grown up there, and he himself owned a coffee farm in the area. Those landowners, including the Baron of Inhaúma, who produced coffee (the most valuable Brazilian export commodity) were the wealthiest and most influential people in Brazil's southeast. They were owners of slaves, and many of them formed the core of the Conservative Party (the ultraconservative wing called saquarema) and were connected to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>through</b> family and political ties.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin can behave aggressively. Males fight for rank {{and access to}} females. During mating season, males compete vigorously with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>through</b> displays of toughness and size, {{with a series of}} acts, such as head-butting. They display aggression towards sharks and smaller dolphin species. At least one population, off Scotland, has practiced infanticide, and also has attacked and killed harbour porpoises. University of Aberdeen researchers say the dolphins do not eat their victims, but are simply competing for food. However, Dr. Read of Duke University, a porpoise expert researching similar cases of porpoise killings that had occurred in Virginia in 1996 and 1997, holds a different view. He states dolphins and porpoises feed on different types of fish, thus food competition is an unlikely cause of the killings. Similar behaviour has been observed in Ireland. In the first half of July, 2014, four attacks with three Porpoise fatalities were observed and caught on video by the Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre in the Cardigan Bay.|$|E
5|$|The ridge {{fell under}} German control in October 1914 during the Race to the Sea as the Franco-British and German forces {{continually}} attempted to outflank <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>through</b> northeastern France. The French Tenth Army attempted to dislodge the Germans {{from the region}} during the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915 by attacking their positions at Vimy Ridge and Notre Dame de Lorette. The French 1st Moroccan Division managed to briefly capture {{the height of the}} ridge but was unable to hold it owing to a lack of reinforcements. The French made another attempt during the Third Battle of Artois in September 1915 but only captured the village of Souchez at the western base of the ridge. The Vimy sector calmed following the offensive with both sides taking a largely live and let live approach. In all, the French suffered approximately 150,000 casualties in their attempts to gain control of Vimy Ridge and surrounding territory.|$|E

5|$|When {{speakers}} of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> <b>Through</b> sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge {{to become more}} similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this {{may lead to the}} formation of language areas in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented, among them, the Balkan language area, the Mesoamerican language area, and the Ethiopian language area. Also, larger areas such as South Asia, Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific areal features.|$|E
5|$|Zigrasimecia {{is known}} for its unusual morphology, and most likely had habits no longer seen in extant species. It has a highly movable head that {{suggests}} mobility was an important factor for them (this is probably for feeding behavior). The morphology of the mandibles would have prevented nest excavation, so the rugose projections on the head may have provided assistance. There is no evidence that Cretaceous ants exhibited nesting behavior, although the queen caste in Z. tonsora suggests that a dealate queen was needed for creating nests. Also, Zigrasimecia and Gerontoformica ants coexisted with each other; this is evident as a recovered piece of amber showed both genera trapped inside. This means that the two ants may have shared some of their ecological niches and possibly interacted with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>through</b> fighting.|$|E
