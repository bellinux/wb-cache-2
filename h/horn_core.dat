5|$|Baryonyx had a {{rudimentary}} secondary palate, similar to crocodiles but unlike most theropod dinosaurs. A rugose (roughly wrinkled) surface suggests {{the presence of}} a horny pad in the roof of the mouth. It had a sagittal crest above the eyes, on the upper mid-line of the nasal bones, which was triangular, narrow, and sharp in front. The lacrimal bone in front of the eye appears to have formed a <b>horn</b> <b>core</b> similar to those seen, for example, on Allosaurus. The dentary was very long and shallow, with a prominent Meckelian groove. The rest of the lower jaw was fragile; the hind third was much thinner than the front, with a blade-like appearance. The front part of the dentary curved outwards to accommodate the large front teeth, and this area formed the mandibular part of the rosette. The dentary had many foramina (openings), which were passages for nerves and blood vessels. It has been suggested that some of Baryonyx cranial bones had been misidentified (resulting in the occiput's too-deep reconstruction), and the skull was probably as low, long and narrow as that of the closely related Suchomimus.|$|E
25|$|According to Rauhut (2000), Ceratosaurus can be {{distinguished}} from related genera based on the following features: a narrow rounded <b>horn</b> <b>core</b> centrally placed on the fused nasals, a median oval groove on nasals behind <b>horn</b> <b>core,</b> a premaxilla with three teeth, premaxillary teeth with reduced extent of mesial serrations, chevrons that are extremely long, a pubis with a large, rounded notch underneath the obturator foramen, small epaxial osteoderms.|$|E
25|$|Fossils from Africa {{have been}} {{recovered}} {{in places such as}} Olduvai Gorge but they are sometimes consist of fragmented pieces of leg bone and horn. The oldest known of these species is Tragelaphus moroitu which has been found in the late Miocene to early Pliocene deposits of the Asa Koma and Kuseralee and the Middle Awash deposits. Similar in appearance to the nyala, Tragelaphus moroitu was a small antelope and has primitive characteristics in the <b>horn</b> <b>core,</b> making it the most primitive known species of spiral-horn antelope in Africa. The evolution of spiral-horned antelopes based on the abundance of fossils shows they were among the most common species of antelope in Africa, and as climatic changes have occurred throughout their evolution, they have undergone faunal turnovers and adapting to new environments.|$|E

500|$|The first ceratopsian remains {{known to}} science were {{discovered}} during the U.S. Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories {{led by the}} American geologist F.V. Hayden. Teeth discovered during an 1855 expedition to Montana were first assigned to hadrosaurids and included within the genus Trachodon. It {{was not until the}} early 20th century that some of these were recognized as ceratopsian teeth. During another of Hayden's expeditions in 1872, Fielding Bradford Meek found several giant bones protruding from a hillside in southwestern Wyoming. He alerted paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, who led a dig to recover the partial skeleton. Cope recognized the remains as a dinosaur, but noted that even though the fossil lacked a skull, it was different from any type of dinosaur then known. He named the new species Agathaumas sylvestris, meaning [...] "marvellous forest-dweller". Soon after, Cope named two more dinosaurs that would eventually come to be recognized as ceratopsids: Polyonax and Monoclonius. Monoclonius was notable for the number of disassociated remains found, including the first evidence of ceratopsid horns and frills. Several Monoclonius fossils were found by Cope, assisted by Charles Hazelius Sternberg, in the summer of 1876 near the Judith River in Chouteau County, Montana. Since the ceratopsians had not been recognised yet as a distinctive group, Cope was uncertain about much of the fossil material, not recognizing the nasal <b>horn</b> <b>core,</b> nor the brow horns, as part of a fossil horn. The frill bone was interpreted {{as a part of the}} breastbone.|$|E
500|$|Adult Achelousaurus skulls had a rugose, heavily pitted boss on {{the snout}} or nasal region, where many other ceratopsids had a horn. Such a boss {{is often called}} [...] "pachyostotic", i.e. {{consisting}} of thickened bone. But describing it as a thick [...] "boss" [...] can be misleading: in fact it forms a wide depression with a thin bone floor and irregular excavations, though it is less depressed than with Pachyrhinosaurus. The nasal boss covered {{about two-thirds of the}} top surface of the nasal bones. The boss was similar to that seen in the related genus Pachyrhinosaurus, though narrower, shorter, and less high. It covered 27% of the total skull length, was 30% longer than the nostril-eye socket distance and was about twice as long as the eye socket. Its rear edge did not reach the level of the eye socket. The nasal boss extended forward, where it fused onto the nasal and premaxilla bones (of the upper jaw) {{at the front of the}} snout, though the nasal bone itself did not fuse with the premaxilla. The boss of specimen MOR 485 furthermore had an excavation (or cavity) at its front end. The <b>horn</b> <b>core</b> that formed the boss may have developed by either becoming procurved (i.e. bent forward) during growth, like the horn of the related Einiosaurus, until it fused onto the nasal bone; or from a simple, erect horn, which later extended its base forward over the snout region, as in Pachyrhinosaurus. The nasal bone formed the top of a large bony nostril. From the rear edge of that nostril a sharp process stuck out to the front. The snout was – compared to that of Einiosaurus – relatively wide at the level of the rear nostrils. The lacrimal bone, in front of the eye socket, was thickened, mainly on the inner surface while the outer surface was featureless apart from a crater-like excavation.|$|E

50|$|The {{species is}} {{represented}} only by two squamosal bones collected from approximately time-equivalent {{sections of the}} upper Judith River Formation and the lower Dinosaur Park Formation. The holotype, ROM 64222, was found by Triebold, in layer of the Judith River Formation dating from the middle Campanian, about seventy-seven million years old. It consists of a partial right squamosal, possibly of a subadult individual. It was acquired by the Royal Ontario Museum. The second specimen, UALVP 54559, was referred. It too is a partial right squamosal but slightly larger and probably of an older individual. It was found by Susan Owen-Kagen, a preparator at the University of Alberta, {{at a distance of}} 380 kilometres from the holotype, in Alberta in the Dinosaur Provincial Park, on the north bank of the Red Deer River, one kilometre east of Happy Jack's Cabin, in a layer of the lower Dinosaur Park Formation, two metres above the Oldman Formation.

50|$|Eotriceratops {{differs from}} other chasmosaurine ceratopsians in unique {{features}} of the skull bones. In 2007, several autapomorphies, unique derived traits, were established. The process of the praemaxilla, obliquely protruding to above and behind in the bony nostril, {{does not have a}} groove or depression on its outer side contrary to the situation with Triceratops; this process is exceptionally wide in side view; it also reaches above the level of the lower border of the fenestra interpraemaxillaris. The episquamosals, the epoccipitals of the squamosal, thus the skin ossifications lining and often protruding {{from the edge of the}} frill, have an extremely elongated base, and are flattened and spindly, touching each other as with Torosaurus utahensis. Near the lower edge of the squamosal a clearly demarcated groove or depression is present. On the lower front of the nasal <b>horn</b> <b>core,</b> a vertical, slightly obliquely running, vein groove meets second vein groove, running horizontally. The epijugal forms an unusually pronounced sharp jugal horn. At its rear upper side the epijugal bears a pronounced process, pointing to behind. A depression on the top of the epijugal forms a contact facet with the jugal; a depression at its inner side forms a separate facet contacting the quadratojugal.|$|E
5000|$|Monoclonius was Edward Drinker Cope's third named ceratopsian, after Agathaumas and Polyonax. Several fossils {{were found}} by Cope, {{assisted}} {{by a young}} Charles Hazelius Sternberg, {{in the summer of}} 1876 near the Judith River in Chouteau County, Montana, only about a hundred miles (some 150 km) from the site of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, fought that June. The finds did not represent a single, let alone articulated, skeleton, but came from different locations. Together they included elements of most parts of the animal (only the feet were entirely missing), including the base part of a long nasal horn, part of the skull frill, brow horns, three fused cervical vertebrae, a sacrum, a shoulder girdle, an ilium, an ischium, two thighbones, a shinbone, a fibula and parts of a forelimb. Just two weeks after leaving Montana, Cope hastily described and named these finds on 30 October 1876 as the type species Monoclonius crassus. The specific name means [...] "the fat one" [...] in Latin. Since the ceratopsians had not been recognised yet as a distinctive group, Cope was uncertain about much of the fossil material, not recognizing the nasal <b>horn</b> <b>core,</b> nor the brow horns, as part of a fossil horn. The skull frill he interpreted as an episternum, an ossified part of the breastbone, and the fused cervicals he assumed to be anterior dorsals.|$|E

5000|$|Adult Achelousaurus skulls had a rugose, heavily pitted boss (a roundish protuberance) on {{the nasal}} region, where many other ceratopsids had a horn. Such a boss {{is often called}} [...] "pachyostotic", {{consisting}} of thickened bone. This can be misleading, however: in fact its bone floor is thin and it forms a wide depression with irregular excavations, though it is less depressed than with Pachyrhinosaurus. The nasal boss covered {{about two-thirds of the}} top surface of the nasal bones. The boss was similar to that seen in the related genus Pachyrhinosaurus, though narrower, shorter, and less high.

5000|$|Coronosaurus is a {{medium-sized}} centrosaurine ceratopsid. Gregory S. Paul in 2010 estimated its body length at five meters, its weight at two tonnes. It had {{as an adult}} inflated supraorbital horncores — the [...] "brow horns" [...] above the eye sockets — but not elongated as in Zuniceratops, chasmosaurines, and more basal centrosaurines (like Albertaceratops and Diabloceratops), that project laterally (to the sides) over the orbit. However, as a sub-adult its postorbital horncores are pyramidal in shape with a slight lateral inflection of the distal, upper, one half. Coronosaurus is unique among ceratopsians in possessing on the rear frill of the skull a number of accessory epiparietal ossifications on its posterior parietal bar that fuse to the posterior and dorsal frill surfaces. They develop through ontogeny, {{the growth of the}} individual, as short spines that may fuse along their adjacent margins into larger, irregular bone masses. They are located close to the midline of the frill in a closely packed bunch above the base of the first epiparietal (P1), the bone spur that at each side growths downwards over the large opening in each frill half. They contribute to the substance of P1 and, through fusion, form a composite epiparietal, that is equivalent to the second epiparietal (P2) normally formed in a more lateral position. The P1 bases can thus be considered the growth positions of the second epiparietals, the P2 loci. Coronosaurus has also a uniquely shaped P3 epiparietal. It is variably developed as a short tongue-like hook or tapered spike that is oriented dorsolaterally, following the curve of the frill. Otherwise, as far as is known Coronosaurus resembles Centrosaurus and Styracosaurus in its morphology. For example, the nasal of Coronosaurus closely resembles that of Centrosaurus apertus in its unfused juvenile or subadult and fused adult forms and appears to have undergone a similar ontogenetic changes. Its erect, laterally compressed nasal <b>horn</b> <b>core</b> has a blunt tip that is formed from the fusion of the opposing nasals. It sits over the posterior portion of the external nares, as it does in all centrosaurines. All juvenile and most adult specimens have gently recurved anterior and posterior margins resulting in most horns having an apex that is oriented at least slightly caudally (backwards).|$|E
5000|$|The {{skull of}} Baryonyx is incompletely known, {{and much of}} the middle and hind {{portions}} are not preserved. The full length of the skull has been estimated to be 950 mm (37.4 in), based on comparison with that of the related genus Suchomimus (which is 20% larger). It was elongated, and the front 170 mm (6.6 in) of the premaxillae formed a long, low snout (rostrum) with a rounded upper surface. The nostrils, far back from the tip, passed horizontally {{from one side of the}} skull to the other. The front 130 mm (5.1 in) of the snout expanded into a spatulate (flared outwards to the sides), [...] "terminal rosette" [...] shape similar to the modern gharial, and the front 70 mm (2.7 in) of the lower margin was downturned (or hooked). The snout was very narrow just behind the rosette. The creature's maxilla and premaxilla fit together in a complex articulation, resulting in a strongly curved tooth row. The gap in the row is comparable to that of Dilophosaurus. The front 140 mm (5.5 in) of the dentary in the mandible curved upwards towards this area, and the gap between the upper and lower jaw is known as the subrostral notch. The snout had extensive pits (which would have been exits for blood vessels and nerves), and the maxilla appears to have housed sinuses.Baryonyx had a rudimentary secondary palate, similar to crocodiles but unlike most theropod dinosaurs. A rugose (roughly wrinkled) surface suggests the presence of a horny pad in the roof of the mouth. It had a sagittal crest above the eyes, on the upper mid-line of the nasal bones, which was triangular, narrow, and sharp in front. The lacrimal bone in front of the eye appears to have formed a <b>horn</b> <b>core</b> similar to those seen, for example, on Allosaurus. The dentary was very long and shallow, with a prominent Meckelian groove. The rest of the lower jaw was fragile; the hind third was much thinner than the front, with a blade-like appearance. The front part of the dentary curved outwards to accommodate the large front teeth, and this area formed the mandibular part of the rosette. The dentary had many foramina (openings), which were passages for nerves and blood vessels. It has been suggested that some of Baryonyx cranial bones had been misidentified (resulting in the occiput's too-deep reconstruction), and the skull was probably as low, long and narrow as that of the closely related Suchomimus.Most of the teeth found with the holotype specimen were not attached to the skull; a few remained in the upper jaw, and only small replacement teeth were in the lower jaw. The teeth had the shape of recurved cones, flattened somewhat sideways. The larger teeth were less recurved than the smaller ones, but were otherwise uniform. The roots were very long, and the teeth slender. The carinae (edges) of the teeth were finely serrated with denticles on the front and back. There were seven narrow, uniform denticles per millimetre (0.039 in), more than in most theropods. Some of the teeth were fluted, with six to eight ridges along the length of their inner sides and fine-grained enamel. The inner side of each tooth row had a bony wall. The number of teeth was large, with seven teeth in the right premaxilla (other theropods have three to five) and thirty-two in the dentary, where sixteen is typical. The lower jaw would have had sixty-four teeth, and the difference between the number of teeth in the upper and lower jaws is more pronounced than in other theropods. The teeth in the dentary were more densely packed than those in the maxilla, and probably smaller. The terminal rosette in the upper jaw had thirteen dental alveoli (tooth sockets), six on the left and seven on the right side; the first four were large (with the second and third the largest), while the fourth and fifth progressively decreased in size. The diameter of the largest was twice that of the smallest. The first four alveoli of the dentary (corresponding to the tip of the upper jaw) were the largest, with the rest more regular in size. Interdental plates were between the alveoli.The neck formed a straighter S shape (a sigmoid curve typical of theropods) than that seen in other theropods; in fact, the neck was initially thought to lack the S curve. The shape of the cervical vertebrae indicate that they tapered towards the head and were progressively longer front to back. The neural spines of the cervical vertebrae were low, thin, and were not always sutured to the centra (the bodies of the vertebrae). The axis vertebra, small relative to the size of the skull, had a well-developed hyposphene. The centra of the dorsal vertebrae were similar in size. Like other dinosaurs, Baryonyx reduced its weight (skeletal pneumaticity) with fenestrae (openings) in the neural arches and with pleurocoels (hollow depressions) in the centra (primarily near the transverse processes). From front to back, the neural spines of the dorsal vertebrae changed from short and stout to tall and broad.|$|E
