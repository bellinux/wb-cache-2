500|$|An {{earlier version}} of [...] "Full on Idle", Title TKs eighth track, was {{released}} on the Amps' Pacer in 1995. In a 1997 interview, Deal {{expressed an interest in}} redoing multiple Amps songs, partially because she did not feel Pacer was well recorded. Bryant opined that both versions of [...] "Full on Idle" [...] sound almost the same, but The Village Voices Jessica Grose wrote that the Breeders' rendition is noticeably slower. In Cibula's view, this version contains elements of country music, cumbia, and ska. The Guardians Betty Clarke cited the line [...] "Obey your colorist, bleach it all away" [...] as an example of Title TKs amusing, off-center lyrics. On [...] "Sinister Foxx", Deal repeatedly sings [...] "Has anyone seen the iguana?" [...] She has explained this as being a reference to buying marijuana: [...] "Have you ever bought a bag of weed? You walk in, and the pot dealer's got an empty terrarium ... Every time <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pot dealer's house, there's no iguana." [...] Another line, [...] "I'm in beer class every Thursday night", refers to the alcohol awareness classes that Richard Presley attended after being caught driving while drunk. Phares described the song as having a [...] "sexy menace", and Berger compared the drum part to gunshots and door-knocking.|$|E
2500|$|He said in 2009 {{that since}} he {{resigned}} as taoiseach the previous year, [...] "life is not as controlled as it was. I’m busy doing different things, some quite important, but it's just not the same. If I {{want to go to}} a match, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> match; if I want to see some friends tomorrow night, I can do that, so it's a big change." ...|$|E
2500|$|Delany is a {{board member}} of the arts {{advocacy}} organization Creative Coalition. She appeared in June 2009 in an onstage meeting in New York alongside White House social secretary Desiree Rogers to discuss ways to promote American cinematic creativity. In August 2009 Delany was named co-president of the Creative Coalition, joining Tim Daly in the leadership of the organization. Delany explained her support for the arts in an interview: [...] "I just think it's so important for children and the future of the country and people's general happiness. I'm one of those people who, whenever I feel cut off spiritually or emotionally, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> museum or a play or a movie, and I'm just transported." [...] She participated as a celebrity guest in fundraising events which support the rights of same-sex couples to marry.|$|E
5000|$|Rumi says:I {{looked for}} God. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> temple, and <b>I</b> didn't find him there. Then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> church, and <b>I</b> didn't find him there. And then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mosque, and <b>I</b> didn't find him there. And then finally I looked in my heart, {{and there he}} was.|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> party yesterday.|$|R

6000|$|... "When I {{want to make}} {{a bargain}} with the devil, I don't come to you, Père Étienne; <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> notary. You ever hear, sir," [...] said Bird, turning to Northwick, [...] "about that notary at Montreal--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Prosser,' he said, 'you are {{a man of}} the world, and I {{should like}} your advice. What would you do in a case like this? <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> theatre to see a play, and what do I find?' ...|$|E

2500|$|Speaking of {{his early}} influences, Roubini said, [...] "I {{was born into a}} {{relatively}} orthodox Jewish family in Iran, lived in Israel and Turkey, and then moved <b>to</b> Italy as <b>a</b> child. By the age of six, instead of going <b>to</b> <b>a</b> yeshiva, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> secular Jewish school where I interacted with kids from all sorts of different backgrounds. Had <b>I</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> orthodox Jewish school, I would perhaps be orthodox now and may have never become a Global Nomad." ...|$|R
60|$|JOHN. To {{make the}} speech at all, Maggie, is {{stronger}} than most would dare. They would do for me if <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> division.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course! I go {{every little}} while just for fun. We all pretend that we don't believe in it, but we do. I'm scared blue every time <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new one--they're all such creepy creatures. The last one I went to was {{positively}} weird." ...|$|E
60|$|There is no animal more graceful in its movements, handsomer {{in shape}} and color, or more bloody and ferocious in its nature, than the Royal Bengal tiger. Even in a cage he is a {{magnificent}} creature. When <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> menagerie, I always look first for the Bengal tigers.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose Mr. Werner, being a {{theatrical}} man, has drawn the long bow {{in his effort}} to impress us," [...] said Patsy. [...] "I've been thinking over some of the pictures I've seen recently and I can't imagine a moral, however intangible or illusive, in connection with any of them. But perhaps I wasn't observant enough. The next time <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> picture show I shall study the plays more carefully." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I couldn't, because <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{vaudeville}} {{show that}} evening, and I was among strangers, so that I couldn't account for my time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> yacht {{race with}} them. I {{happened}} {{to meet them}} in the street, and {{they wanted me to}} go; and I was all broken up, and--I Went." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I shall {{give myself}} up," [...] he said. [...] "I {{know that you}} would make me welcome in your tents; but from what you have told me, I {{see that there is}} no {{prospect}} whatever of an escape through China, and that if I go out to the plains I shall be there for life, while if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> prison I may in time be released, or at any rate I can again escape." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And he'll {{charge you}} {{twice as much}} for it, and make {{three times as much}} bother about it, as the fellows in the next street who have your title-deeds. When I want lawyer's {{business}} done, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lawyer; and when I want to borrow money, I go to my own man of business; he makes it his business to find money, and he daren't rob me more than is decent, fitting, and customary, because he has a character to lose." ...|$|E
60|$|So again I {{declined}} {{when the}} ladies in the coach {{invited me to}} their houses in Paris. Should <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> convent? they asked; and one began to recommend the Carmelites, another the Visitation, another Port Royal, till I was almost distracted; and M. le Marquis began {{to say it was}} a pious and commendable wish, but that devotion had its proper times and seasons, and that judgment must be exercised as to the duration of a retreat, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Segal's {{family was}} Jewish, {{but he was}} raised in a secular household. A {{paternal}} great-grandfather ran for governor of Massachusetts as a socialist. When asked if he had a bar mitzvah, Segal stated: [...] "I'm afraid not. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Passover Seder at Groucho Marx's once and he kept saying, 'When do we get to the wine?' So that's my Jewish experience. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> friend's bar mitzvah, and that was the only time I was in Temple Beth Shalom. Jewish life wasn't happening that much at the time. People's car tires were slashed in front of the temple. I was once kicked {{down a flight of stairs}} by some kids from the local parochial school".|$|R
5000|$|A {{couple of}} days before we {{recorded}} [...] "Catch a Ride", the Stones released [...] "Satisfcation". And I heard that fuzz tone, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> music store, and I said, [...] "Whats is that? Whatever it is, I want one.|$|R
60|$|And <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> back back street, {{with plenty}} of cheap cheap shops, And I bought an oilskin hat and a {{second-hand}} suit of slops, And <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> LIEUTENANT BELAYE (and he never suspected ME!) And I entered myself as a chap as wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense!" [...] {{cried the}} other man. [...] "Go ahead, if you like, and boggle around in rubber boots wearing {{yourself}} {{out trying to}} catch fish. When I want one <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cool restaurant and order it. I laugh at you fellows whenever I think of you hustling around in the heat in the country thinking you are having a good time. For me Father Knickerbocker's little improved farm with the big shady lane running {{through the middle of}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The other is," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "that I do {{not wish}} to have the trouble of the luggage while I am looking out lodgings. If <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hotel and leave my luggage there and take a room, and then go and look up lodgings, we have the hotel bill to pay, without getting much benefit from it; and, if we take the luggage on a cab, we might go to a dozen {{different}} places before we find a room to suit us, and so have a monstrous great cab fare to pay." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{go out of}} the hotel. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{cafe and}} order a bock. I smoke a cigarette. It is {{necessary}} that I think out plans. Shall I with my one thousand francs rent a studio in the Quarter and commence my life as artist? No. I have still the genius, the ent'usiasm, but I have not the training. To train myself to paint pictures I must study long, and even one thousand francs will not last for ever. Then what shall I do? I do not know. I order one other bock, and smoke more cigarettes, but still I do not know.|$|E
5000|$|Asked {{if he is}} {{religious}} — in {{the context}} of portraying a vicar in Grantchester — Norton said: [...] "Obviously I have a relationship with religion, because <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Catholic school and studied theology. I can't call myself religious, but I'm definitely fascinated by it".|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{hotel in}} a tumbril. It {{required}} strong self-suppression {{for me to}} keep from climbing {{to the top of}} it and giving an imitation of Sidney Carton. The vehicle was drawn by beasts of a bygone era and driven by something dark and emancipated.|$|R

6000|$|... "That young man, Mr. Inspector," [...] he said complainingly, [...] "puts {{altogether}} {{too much}} feeling into his work. I {{may have been}} a bit sarcastic with him once or twice; but if it comes to a lifelong vendetta, or anything of that sort, why, he's beginning to look for trouble--that's all! I'm getting sick of the sight of him. If ever I lunch or dine out he's there. If <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> theater he's about. Whatever harmless amusement I go in for he's there looking on. Just give him a word of caution, Mr. Inspector. I'm a good-tempered man, but this can't go on forever." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Guele told of her {{homesickness}} {{up here in}} {{the long}} winters; of her honest, country-woman troubles and alarms upon the journey; how in the bank at Frankfort she had feared lest the banker, after having taken her cheque, should deny all knowledge of it--a fear I have myself every time <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bank; and how crossing the Lüneburger Heath, an old lady witnessing her trouble and finding whither she was bound, had given her [...] "the blessing of a person eighty years old, which would be sure to bring her safely to the States. And the first thing I did," [...] added Mrs. Guele, [...] "was to fall down-stairs." ...|$|E
