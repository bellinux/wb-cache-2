500|$|Groves {{steadily}} overcame one crisis after another, {{dealing with}} strikes, shortages, competing priorities and engineers {{who were not}} up to their tasks. He worked {{six days a week}} in his office in Washington, D.C. During the week he would determine which project was in the greatest need of personal attention and pay it a visit on Sunday. Groves later recalled that he was [...] "hoping to get to a war theater so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> little peace." ...|$|E
500|$|Phillips, meanwhile, {{was always}} on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader {{audience}} the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused. As Keisker reported, [...] "Over and over I remember Sam saying, 'If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars.'" [...] In June, he acquired a demo recording by Jimmy Sweeney of a ballad, [...] "Without You", that he thought might suit the teenage singer. Presley came by the studio, but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew. He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield [...] "Scotty" [...] Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work something up with Presley for a recording session.|$|E
2500|$|After {{finishing}} high school, Morath {{passed the}} Abitur and {{was obliged to}} complete six months of service for the Reichsarbeitsdienst (Reich Labour Service) before entering Berlin University. At university, Morath studied languages. She became fluent in French, English, and Romanian {{in addition to her}} native German (to these she later added Spanish, Russian and Chinese). [...] "I studied where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> quiet space, in the University and the Underground stations that served as air-raid shelters. I did not join the Studentenschaft (Student Organization)." ...|$|E

60|$|These {{ideas are}} often clever. They are also logical and interesting. So I have used them {{whenever}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>an</b> opportunity, {{and it is}} but just that I acknowledge my indebtedness to my little friends.|$|R
60|$|As {{this was}} said, the girl vanished. Before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>an</b> {{aperture}} {{to watch her}} movements, she had disappeared. Susquesus arose a few minutes later, but he never made any allusion to the secret visit of the girl. In this respect, he observed the most scrupulous delicacy, never letting me know by hint, look, or smile, {{that he had been}} in the least conscious of her presence.|$|R
2500|$|After the Civil War broke out, {{the town}} of Concord, Massachusetts rallied, inspiring many young men to volunteer. The company {{assembled}} on the town common on April 19, 1861, {{the anniversary of the}} Battles of Lexington and Concord as they set off. Louisa May Alcott wrote to her friend Alf Whitman that it was [...] "a sight to behold". She was disappointed that she had to stay behind, lamenting, [...] "as I can't fight, I will content myself with working with those who can." [...] She joined local women who volunteered to sew clothes and provide other supplies. On her 30th birthday on November 29, 1862, she made up her mind to do more. She recorded in her journal, [...] "Thirty years old. Decide to go to Washington as a nurse if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> place." [...] She received her orders on December 11 and made her way to Georgetown, outside of Washington, D.C. While working as a nurse, Alcott contracted typhoid fever and was treated with mercury in the form of calomel. She survived but later recorded, [...] "I was never ill before this time, and never well afterward." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{described}} {{the situation as}} [...] "admirable" [...] {{during a visit to}} the Philippines in the 1870s.The lines separating entire classes and races, appeared to me less marked than in the Oriental colonies. I have seen on the same table, Spaniards, Mestizos (Chinos cristianos) and Indios, priests and military. There is no doubt that having one Religion forms great bonding. And more so to the eyes of one that has been observing the repulsion and differences due to race in many parts of Asia. And from one (like myself) who knows that race is the great divider of society, the admirable contrast and exception to racial discrimination so markedly presented by the people of the Philippines is indeed admirable.Another foreign witness was English engineer, Frederic H. Sawyer, who had {{spent most of his life}} in different parts of Asia and lived in Luzon for fourteen years. His impression was that as far as racial integration and harmony was concerned, the situation in the Philippines was not equaled by any other colonial power:"... Spaniards and natives lived together in great harmony, and do not know where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> colony in which Europeans mixes as much socially with the natives.|$|E

60|$|Before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>an</b> {{answer to}} this immensely {{comprehensive}} question, an apparition advanced towards me, out of a dark corner of the kitchen. A wan, wild, haggard girl, with remarkably beautiful hair, and with a fierce keenness in her eyes, came limping up on a crutch to the table at which I was sitting, {{and looked at me}} as if I was an object of mingled interest and horror, which it quite fascinated her to see.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well {{my view is}} {{a social}} problem," [...] said Hugo, [...] "and social {{problems}} are the fashion at present. It would be solved through the exceptions, which prove the principle. In the first place, there are your swells who cannot avoid the halter--you are booked when you are born; {{and then there are}} moderate men like myself, who have their weak moments. I would not answer for myself if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>an</b> affectionate family with good shooting and first-rate claret." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Nothing more simple,' said he. 'It was our {{intention}} {{to start at}} early dawn. Feeling chilled after dressing, I thought that a cup of wine would do me no harm, so I came down to see what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find.</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> was rummaging about, the house was suddenly carried by assault so rapidly {{that by the time}} I had climbed the stairs it was all over. It only remained for me to save myself, so I came down here and hid myself in the back cellar, where you have found me.' ...|$|R

[...] Lady Cantrip could not but smile when she remembered the immense wealth {{of the man who}} was speaking to her;--and the Duke saw the smile and understood it. [...] "You will understand what I mean, Lady Cantrip. If this young man were in other respects suitable, of course <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>an</b> income for them. But he is nothing; just an idle seeker for pleasure without the means of obtaining it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As a rule, I have {{a use for}} all {{the money}} I've got," [...] he remarked. [...] "Still if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> lot that was bound to go up----" ...|$|E

60|$|Oct. 26. I wandered to {{see where}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> place {{convenient}} for my abode. I fixed upon a rock in the evening, marked out a half-moon, intending to erect a wall, fortified with piles, lined within with pieces of cables, and covered with turf.|$|E

60|$|Besides these things, I {{took all}} the men's clothes that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find,</b> and <b>a</b> spare fore-topsail, hammock, and some bedding; and with this I loaded my second raft, and brought them all safe on shore, to my very great comfort.|$|R
