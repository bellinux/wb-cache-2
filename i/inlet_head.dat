Numerical analysis of transient phenomena, such as increase of the rotational speed (runaway) of the units, increase of the pressure (turbine <b>inlet</b> <b>head)</b> in the hydraulic system (water hammer) and water level oscillation in the surge tank is presented.

Usually, different researchers may choose alternate values for an unknown modeling parameter and this can have significant effects on the results. The main aim in this paper is to investigate of the sensitivity of transient phenomena analysis with variation in modeling parameters such as pipeline friction factor, wave speed, turbine guide vanes closing law, surge tank throttling coefficient and generator inertia. ...|$|E

40|$|Manganese-iron oxide concretions are {{presently}} forming on Patrick Sill in upper Jervis Inlet. The marine geology of Patrick Sill and the adjoining basins (Queen's Reach and Princess Royal Reach) was studied {{to define the}} environment in which the concretions form. The river at the <b>inlet</b> <b>head</b> is the principal source of sediment to the upper basin. The average grain size of surficial bottom sediments within this basin decreases uniformly with distance from the source. Patrick Sill separates the upper from the lower basin. The sediment distribution pattern within the lower basin differs markedly from the upper basin as there is no dominant source of material but rather many localized sources. Abundant shallow marine faunal remains recovered in deep water sediment samples indicate that sediments deposited as deltas off river and stream mouths periodically slump to the basin floors. Geologic and optical turbidity information for the upper basin can best be explained by slumping from the delta at the <b>inlet</b> <b>head</b> with the initiation of turbidity or density currents. Patrick Sill appears to create a downstream barrier to this flow. The mineralogy of the bottom sediments indicates derivation from a granitic terrain. If this is so, the sediments presently being deposited in both basins are reworked glacial materials initially derived by glacial action outside the present watershed. Upper Jervis Inlet is mapped as lying within a roof pendant of pre-batholithic rocks, principally slates. Patrick Sill is thought to be a bedrock feature mantled with Pleistocene glacial material. The accumulation rate of recent sediments on the sill is low especially in the V-notch or medial depression. The manganese-iron oxide concretions are forming within the depression and apparently nowhere else in the study area. Also forming within the depression are crusts of iron oxide and what are tentatively identified as glauconite-montmorillonoid pellets. The concretions are thought to form by precipitation of manganese-iron oxides on pebbles and cobbles lying at the sediment water interface. The oxide materials are mobile in the reducing environment of the underlying clayey-sand sediment but precipitate on contact with the oxygenating environment of the surficial sediments. The iron crusts are thought to be forming on extensive rocky surfaces above the sediment water interface. The overall appearance and evidence of rapid formation of the crusts suggests they formed from a gel in sea water. Reserves of manganese-iron concretions on Patrick Sill were estimated to be 117 metric tons. Other deposits of concretions have recently been found in other inlets and in the Strait of Georgia but, to date, the extent of these has not been determined...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{numerical}} tool is introduced—based on thermodynamic and kinetic separa- tion theory—for validating the regeneration of monolithic rod columns after cutting their inlet sections. A long-used RP- 18 e monolithic column was {{deemed to be}} unfit for further coffee analysis because of poor separation performance. The columns brownish inlet section was physically removed with a lathe, leaving a clean white inlet section. The original and regenerated columns were extensively analyzed and compared using numerical tools for processing adsorption data. The perturbation peak method {{was used to measure}} the adsorp- tion isotherm of phenol on the original and regenerated monolith and the adsorption energy distributions were calculated for identifying any change in the degree of heterogeneity. Al- though peak shapes improved considerably after regeneration, {{no significant differences were found}} in the detailed characterization of the processed adsorption data between the original column and the regenerated one. This indicates that the removal of a section of the monolithic bed can be undertaken without damaging the column and columns in which their <b>inlet</b> <b>head</b> sections are contaminated may still function with normal adsorption behav- ior.

40|$|Inducers {{are used}} as a first stage in pumps to hinder {{cavitation}} and promote stable flow. Inducers pressurize the working fluid sufficiently such that cavitation does not develop {{in the rest of}} the pump, which allows the pump to operate at lower <b>inlet</b> <b>head</b> conditions. Despite the distinct advantages of inducer use, an undesirable region of backflow and resulting cavitation can form near the tips of the inducer blades. This backflow is often attributed to tip leakage flow, or the flow induced by the pressure differential across an inducer blade at the tip. We examine backflow of a single inducer geometry at varying flow coefficients with a tip clearance of τ = 0. 32 %, and no tip clearance. Removing the tip clearance prevents tip leakage flow. At all flow coefficients below design, we observe backflow penetrating up to 14 % further upstream in the inducer with no tip clearance. The backflow region in the inducer with no tip clearance experiences higher velocities and extends further into the core flow. However, the inducer with tip clearance develops a larger vortex at the leading edge of the blades. A comprehensive analysis of these simulations suggests that diffusion as the working fluid is loaded onto the blades, not tip leakage flow, is the driving force for the formation of backflow...|$|E

40|$|Measurements {{have been}} made by a light {{scattering}} method of the optical turbidity of the waters in some typical British Columbia inIets with depths to 700 m. (The optical turbidity here used is the extinction cocfficicnt or fractional reduction in light intensity per meter length due to scattering.) The major contribution to the turbidity in the large inlets is the minerogenic material brought in by rivers. Therefore those inlets with rivers originating in glaciers exhibit the highest turbidity values and thcrc is a marked seasonal variation. In the surface layers, values recorded for turbidity range from 0. 2 m-l in winter to 35 m- 1 in summer with a marked decrease from head to mouth of the inlet. The main body of water in an inlet is usually fairly uniform in turbidity at 0. 1 to 2 m-I. (For comparison, double distilled water has a turbidity of O. O 24 m- ’ for light of wavelength 5460 A in air.) Particle sizes average about 20 ~ diameter in summer and 8 ~ in winter, with little material less than 2 ~ in diamctcr.

40|$|Many {{off-grid}} micro hydropower {{development programs}} have been carried-out {{in recent years in}} Sri Lanka. Micro hydro turbines are now manufactured locally and need to be improve the geometrical parameters to achieve higher efficiencies. To improve the manufacturing quality, and hence to achieve better performances, it made as a requirement to check performance of micro hydro turbines for the Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development Project in Sri Lanka. To cater the above requirement, a Turbine Test Rig Facility have been developed and established by the NERD Centre of Sri Lanka. This facility is in compliance with IEC 60193 / 99. It has two test loops to test high and low head turbines, of up to 10 kW capacities.

40|$|Conventional drip {{irrigation}} {{is considered one}} of the most efﬁcient irrigation systems. Alternatively to traditional surface {{drip irrigation}} systems (DI), laterals are deployed underneath the soil surface, as in subsurface drip irrigation (SDI), leading to a higher potential efﬁciency, which is of especial interest in places where water is a limited source. The design and management of DI and SDI systems involve selection of an appropriate combination of emitter discharge rate and spacing between emitters and the inlet pressure and irrigation time for any given set of soil, crop, and climatic conditions, as well as understanding the wetted zone pattern around the emitter. Likewise, water distribution is affected by soil hydraulic properties, initial water content, emitter discharge, irrigation frequency, evapotranspiration and root characteristics. However, complexity arousing of soil water properties and soil proﬁle characteristics means that these are often not properly considered in the design and management of those systems. A better understanding of the inﬁltration process around the discharge point source should contribute to increase water use efﬁciency and thus to reduce the risk of environmental impact of irrigation. In this regard, numerical models have been proved to be a powerful tool to analyze the evolution of the wetting pattern during the distribution and redistribution processes, in order to explore irrigation management strategies, to set up the duration of irrigation, and ﬁnally to optimize water use efﬁciency. Also, irrigation design variables such as emitter spacing and discharge could also be assessed. In this study the suitability of the HYDRUS- 2 D to simulate inﬁltration process around an emitter during irrigation of a loamy soil with drip and SDI laterals has been addressed. The model was then applied in order to evaluate the main dimensions of the wetted soil volume surrounding the emitter during irrigation. Irrigation uniformity with DI and SDI laterals were determined by ﬁeld evaluations at different <b>inlet</b> <b>head</b> pressures. Results were related with estimations made on water distribution within the soil that were simulated taking into account the emitter discharge at different lateral locations, initial soil water content, soil hydraulic properties and time of irrigation. Conclusions highlight the effect of emitter discharge, emitter spacing, and irrigation time on wetting patterns, and thus solute transport, in both drip and subsurface drip irrigation. The effect of emitter depth was also considered in SDI. Some recommendations for the design and management of these irrigation systems are also provided...|$|E
40|$|Svalbard is a Norwegian Archipelago {{located in}} the Arctic Circle that {{has a long history}} of coal-mining. The coal is used by the local power-station to provide {{electricity}} to the residential settlements, as well as being exported to countries, e. g. Norway and Germany. Bulk coal fly-ash (CFA) produced from the Longyearbyen Power-Station was collected by Dr Lisa Mol in 2014. Here we report the first geo-toxicological investigation of CFA derived from this Artic region. 	The bulk CFA (Figure 1 a) from Svalbard was separated into inhalable particles (Figure 1 b), as a means to test their oxidative capacity in the lung environment. Dry CFA was resuspended inside a rotating-drum fitted with a PM 10 -selective <b>inlet</b> <b>head</b> attached to an air-pump. The air-flow rates of 5, 10 and 20 litres per minute produced different sized (i. e. PM 1, 2. 5, 10, respectively) particles for geo-toxicological analysis. Analysis of CFA physicochemical properties has been on-going (e. g. surface area, size, shape, number, metal chemistry) as they are known drivers of the oxidative capacity of particulate matter (PM). Knowledge of particle size informs on probable deposition sites within the lung, and thereby, estimation of toxic potential. For example, PM < 0. 1 µm will have the greatest toxic effect(s) because nano-sized particles readily enter alveoli in the distal respiratory tract to provoke inflammation. The main cause of PM bioreactivity is believed to be through their induction of oxidative stress by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). 	Ferrous minerals can be found in varying levels in CFA depending on the coal geochemistry, and have been indicated to cause the most damage through inducing ROS via Fenton reactions (Brown et al., 2011). Svalbard CFA was exposed to a neodymium magnet in order to extract magnetic components. All CFA fractions demonstrated a very high-presence of ferrous minerals. Accordingly, pure magnetite (Fe 2 O 4) was selected to be a positive control particle for assessing CFA toxicity. 	Preliminary physicochemical characterisation involved field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and associated energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX) to determine the inorganic elemental composition of bulk and inhalable-sized CFA fractions. The oxidative capacity of Svalbard CFA was determined by the Plasmid Scission Assay (PSA). PSA employs a ROS-sensitive plasmid that exhibits different DNA morphologies relative to specific levels of ‘damage’ (i. e. relaxed, linear and fragmented) versus DNA ‘un-damaged’ (i. e. super-coiled); that are captured via gel electrophoresis. Svalbard CFA caused DNA damage in a dose-responsive manner; thus inferring toxicity (Figure 2). Preliminary results have implied that a dose as low as 5 µg/ml induced minor (i. e. relaxed) DNA damage, with the total amount of damage being increased gradually to approximately 40...|$|E
