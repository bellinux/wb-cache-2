The final {{years of his life}} were spent in Angmering, West Sussex, with Violet. Holloway forged close friendships with fellow performers including Leslie Henson, Gracie Fields, Maurice Chevalier, Laurence Olivier and Arthur Askey, who said of him, [...] "He was the nicest man <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>knew.</b> He never had a wrong word to say about anyone. He was a great actor, a super mimic and a one-man walking comic show." [...] While working in the US, Holloway numbered among his friends Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Burgess Meredith and Groucho Marx.|$|E

500|$|In 1942, Clark Shaughnessy {{was hired}} as head coach. Shaughnessy had {{achieved}} fame at Stanford, where he installed his quarterback-centric version of the T-formation as his primary offensive scheme. In response, Glenn [...] "Pop" [...] Warner had said, [...] "If Stanford wins a single game with that crazy formation, you can throw all the football <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>knew</b> in the Pacific Ocean." [...] Stanford, which had gone 1–7–1 the previous season, went undefeated in Shaughnessy's first year and earned the number-two ranking in the final AP Poll. Shaughnessy was named 1940 College Coach of the Year for the turnaround performance. Under Shaughnessy, the Terps went 7–2, {{with one of the}} losses a 0–42 shutout at Duke, which in five seasons had won the Southern Conference three times and been ranked in the AP top-20 four times. After one season, Shaughnessy left Maryland for Pittsburgh.|$|E
500|$|Not all the 25men who {{remained}} on Bounty were mutineers; Bligh's launch was overloaded, and some who {{stayed with the}} ship did so under duress. [...] "Never fear, lads, I'll do you justice if ever I reach England", Bligh is reported as saying. With regard to Heywood, however, Bligh {{was convinced that the}} young man was as guilty as Christian. Bligh's first detailed comments on the mutiny are {{in a letter to his}} wife Betsy, in which he names Heywood [...] ( [...] a mere boy not yet 16) [...] as [...] "one of the ringleaders", adding: [...] "I have now reason to curse the day <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>knew</b> a Christian or a Heywood or indeed a Manks man. Bligh's later official account to the Admiralty lists Heywood with Christian, Edward Young and George Stewart as the mutiny's leaders, describing Heywood as a young man of abilities for whom he had felt a particular regard. To the Heywood family Bligh wrote: [...] "His baseness is beyond all description." ...|$|E

500|$|Fred Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity {{deals with}} the tribulations of three soldiers, played by Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, and Sinatra, {{stationed}} on Hawaii {{in the months leading}} up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Sinatra had long been desperate to find a film role which would bring him back into the spotlight, and Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn had been inundated by appeals from people across Hollywood to give Sinatra a chance to star as [...] "Maggio" [...] in the film. During production, Montgomery Clift became a close friend, and Sinatra later professed that he [...] "learned more about acting from him than anybody <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>knew</b> before". After several years of critical and commercial decline, his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor win helped him regain his position as the top recording artist in the world. His performance also won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture. The Los Angeles Examiner wrote that Sinatra is [...] "simply superb, comical, pitiful, childishly brave, pathetically defiant", commenting that his death scene is [...] "one of the best ever photographed".|$|E
500|$|A workaholic, Kubrick rarely took a {{vacation}} or left England during the forty {{years before he}} died. Biographer Vincent LoBrutto notes that Kubrick's confined way of living and desire for privacy has led to spurious stories about his reclusiveness, {{similar to those of}} Greta Garbo, Howard Hughes, and J. D. Salinger. Michael Herr, Kubrick's co-screenwriter on Full Metal Jacket, who knew him well, considers his [...] "reclusiveness" [...] to be myth: [...] "e was in fact a complete failure as a recluse, unless you believe that a recluse is simply someone who seldom leaves his house. Stanley saw a lot of people... {{he was one of the}} most gregarious men <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>knew,</b> and it didn't change anything that most of this conviviality went on over the phone." [...] Lo Brutto states that one of the reasons he acquired a reputation as a recluse was because he insisted in remaining near his home, but the reason for this was because for Kubrick there were only three places on the planet he could make high quality films with the necessary technical expertise and equipment: Los Angeles, New York or around London. He disliked living in Los Angeles, and had thought London a superior film production center to New York.|$|E
500|$|He {{had been}} working on the {{screenplay}} notes for over a year {{at the time of his}} death. [...] "He was more inquisitive than anybody <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>knew.</b> He was writing a screenplay about his life. He was interested in world affairs, sometimes he'd call me up late at night and discuss philosophy. I think he'll be remembered as a great man. He happened to make a living playing basketball but he was more than that. He could talk on any subject. He was a Goliath", said Sy Goldberg, Chamberlain's longtime attorney. When million-dollar contracts became common in the NBA, Chamberlain increasingly felt he had been underpaid during his career. A result of this resentment was the 1997 book Who's Running the Asylum? Inside the Insane World of Sports Today (1997), in which he harshly criticized the NBA of the 1990s for being too disrespectful of players of the past. Even far beyond his playing days, Chamberlain was a very fit person. In his mid-forties, he was able to humble rookie Magic Johnson in practice, and even in the 1980s, he flirted with making a comeback in the NBA. In the 1980–81 NBA season, coach Larry Brown recalled that the 45-year-old Chamberlain had received an offer from the Cleveland Cavaliers. When Chamberlain was 50, the New Jersey Nets had the same idea, and Chamberlain declined again. However, he would continue to epitomize physical fitness for years to come, including participating in several marathons.|$|E
