5|$|Because {{of their}} size, shape, and {{well-defined}} chemical structures, viruses {{have been used}} as templates for organising materials on the nanoscale. Recent examples include work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., using Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) particles to amplify signals in <b>DNA</b> <b>microarray</b> based sensors. In this application, the virus particles separate the fluorescent dyes used for signalling to prevent the formation of non-fluorescent dimers that act as quenchers. Another example is the use of CPMV as a nanoscale breadboard for molecular electronics.|$|E
5|$|An {{idea of the}} {{complexity}} of the metabolic networks in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 metabolites to the right: the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 45,000 genes. However, it is now possible to use this genomic data to reconstruct complete networks of biochemical reactions and produce more holistic mathematical models that may explain and predict their behavior. These models are especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on gene expression from proteomic and <b>DNA</b> <b>microarray</b> studies. Using these techniques, a model of human metabolism has now been produced, which will guide future drug discovery and biochemical research. These models are now used in network analysis, to classify human diseases into groups that share common proteins or metabolites.|$|E

However, protein microarrays have not quite taken off as expected, {{even with the}} necessary tools and know-how from <b>DNA</b> <b>microarrays</b> being in place and ready for adaptation.

Fluorescent labeling with Cy3 was shown to be more insufficient and skew results; the method of aminoallyl nucleotide incorporation was opted instead.

25|$|DNA microarrays {{are used}} in macaque research. For example, Michael Katze of University of Washington, Seattle, {{infected}} macaques with 1918 and modern influenzas. The <b>DNA</b> <b>microarray</b> showed the macaque genomic response to human influenza on a cellular level in each tissue. Both viruses stimulated innate immune system inflammation, but the 1918 flu stimulated stronger and more persistent inflammation, causing extensive tissue damage, {{and it did not}} stimulate the interferon-1 pathway.

25|$|Analyses of {{synchronized}} {{cultures of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae under conditions that prevent DNA replication initiation without delaying cell cycle progression showed that origin licensing decreases {{the expression of}} genes with origins near their 3' ends, revealing that downstream origins can regulate the expression of upstream genes.

25|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>microarray</b> {{analysis}} {{is currently being}} used in AM fungal research to simultaneously measure the expression of many genes from target species or experimental samples. The most common tool or method is to use functional gene array (FGA) technology, a specialized microarray that contains probes for genes that are functionally important in microbial processes such as carbon, nitrogen or phosphorus cycling. FGAs {{have the ability to}} simultaneously examine many functional genes. This technique is typically used for general analysis of functional microbial genes, but when complemented with genetic sequencing, inferences can be made about the connection between fungal community composition and microbial functionality.|$|E

40|$|Selectivity and {{sensitivity}} in {{the detection of}} single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are among most important attributes to determine the performance of <b>DNA</b> <b>microarrays.</b> We previously reported the generation of a novel mesospaced surface prepared by applying dendron molecules on the solid surface. <b>DNA</b> <b>microarrays</b> that were fabricated on the dendron-modified surface exhibited outstanding performance {{for the detection of}} single nucleotide variation in the synthetic oligonucleotide <b>DNA.</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>microarrays</b> on the dendron-modified surface were subjected to the detection of single nucleotide variations in the exons 5 – 8 of the p 53 gene in genomic DNAs from cancer cell lines. <b>DNA</b> <b>microarrays</b> on the dendron-modified surface clearly discriminated single nucleotide variations in hotspot codons with high selectivity {{and sensitivity}}. The ratio between the fluorescence intensity of perfectly matched duplexes and that of single nucleotide mismatched duplexes was > 5 – 100 without sacrificing signal intensity. Our results showed that the outstanding performance of <b>DNA</b> <b>microarrays</b> fabricated on the dendron-modified surface is strongly related to novel properties of the dendron molecule, which has the conical structure allowing mesospacing between the capture probes. Our microarrays on the dendron-modified surface can reduce the steric hindrance not only between the solid surface and target DNA, but also among immobilized capture probes enabling the hybridization process on the surface to be very effective. Our <b>DNA</b> <b>microarrays</b> on the dendron-modified surface could be applied to various analyses that require accurate detection of SNPs...|$|R
25|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>microarray</b> {{studies done}} on {{different}} fish species exposed to low-oxygen conditions {{have shown that}} at the genetic level fish respond to hypoxia by changing the expression of genes involved in oxygen transport, ATP production, and protein synthesis. In the liver of mudsuckers exposed to hypoxia there were changes in the expression of genes involved in heme metabolism such as hemopexin, heme oxygenase 1, and ferritin. Changes in the sequestration and metabolism of iron may suggest hypoxia induced erythropoiesis and increased demand for hemoglobin synthesis, leading to increased oxygen uptake and transport. Increased expression of myoglobin, which is normally only found in muscle tissue, has also been observed after hypoxia exposure in the gills of zebrafish and in non-muscle tissue of the common carp suggesting increased oxygen transport throughout fish tissues.|$|E
25|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>microarray</b> is a {{bioinformatics}} tool used {{to quantify}} expression levels of various genes simultaneously, {{and has been}} used extensively {{in the study of}} adipose tissue. One such study used microarray analysis in conjunction with Ingenuity IPA software to look at changes in WAT and BAT gene expression when mice were exposed to temperatures of 28 and 6°C. The most significantly up- and downregulated genes were then identified and used for analysis of differentially expressed pathways. It was discovered that many of the pathways upregulated in WAT after cold exposure are also highly expressed in BAT, such as oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, and pyruvate metabolism. This suggests that some of the adipocytes switched to a beige phenotype at 6°C. Mössenböck et al. also used microarray analysis to demonstrate that insulin deficiency inhibits the differentiation of beige adipocytes but does not disturb their capacity for browning. These two studies demonstrate the potential for the use of microarray in the study of WAT browning.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally DNA microarrays use {{complementary}} DNA or oligonucleotide probes {{to analyze}} messenger RNA (mRNA) from genes of interest. Extracted total RNA {{serves as a}} template for complementary DNA (cDNA) that is tagged with fluorescent probes before being allowed to hybridize to the microarray for visualization. For proteases, specific probes for protease genes and their inhibitors {{have been developed to}} view expression patterns on the mRNA transcript level. The two platforms currently available for this purpose come from corporate and academic sources. Affymetrix’s Hu/Mu ProtIn Microarray uses 516 and 456 probe sets to evaluate human and murine proteases, inhibitors, and interactors respectively. CLIP-CHIP™, developed by the Overall Lab, is a complete protease and inhibitor <b>DNA</b> <b>microarray</b> for all 1561 human and murine proteases, non-proteolytic homologues, and their inhibitors. Both of these tools allow comparison of expression patterns between normal and diseased samples and tissues. Unfortunately, as transcript levels often fail to reflect protein expression levels, gene microarrays are limited in representing protein in samples. In addition, proteases recruited from remote sources like nearby tissues are ignored by these DNA based arrays, reiterating the need for protein based methods to confirm the presence and activity of functional enzymes when transcriptome analysis is performed.|$|E
