The chambers were constructed from sarsen, a dense, hard, and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of silicified sand from the Eocene epoch. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them {{to the site of the}} monument to be erected.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{original}} <b>design</b> <b>plan,</b> a cryogenic, superconducting magnet system was developed for the AMS-02. This was reported by NASA to be a critical technology, granting the instrument the high sensitivity needed to achieve mission objectives. Late in its development, however, poorly understood anomalous heating in the cryogenic magnet system was discovered. As a result, the AMS-02 experiment leader, Samuel C. C. Ting, decided to replace the superconducting magnet inside the spectrometer with the permanent magnet previously used in AMS-01.|$|E

25|$|JBG {{began the}} {{redevelopment}} of L'Enfant Plaza in 2006 when it secured a $242 million mortgage loan for its renovation projects. That same year, the NCPC and District officials held joint hearings to identify needs and solicit ideas for L'Enfant plaza. Maintenance {{of the plaza}} had become a major issue, as bricks in the esplanade were broken {{and much of the}} landscaping was in poor condition. The hearings identified an immediate need to plant trees along the esplanade, build bike lanes, and install public seating. But the hearings also gave new life to the Urban Land Institute's 1998 redevelopment ideas, and formally adopted them as a tentative <b>design</b> <b>plan</b> for L'Enfant Promenade.|$|E
25|$|The {{commission}} approved Labeaume's {{land clearance}} and memorial <b>design</b> <b>plan,</b> and in 1935, the city issued a $7.5 million bond to purchase and demolish buildings at the site. The clearance project was aided by $9 {{million from the}} Works Progress Administration, and work began quickly on acquisition and demolition of the forty block area. The only remnant of Laclede's street grid to be preserved was north of the Eads Bridge (in what {{is now known as}} Laclede's Landing), while the only building in the area to remain was the Old Cathedral, built in 1834. Demolition continued until the outbreak of World War II, when the area began {{to be used as a}} parking lot, and the project remained stalled until the late 1940s.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s {{and again}} in the 1960s, the United States Postal Service (USPS) sought land for a new post office site to serve as the central {{facility}} for the Bronx, replacing the Bronx Central Annex on 149th Street. In 1964, the building site (now planned as a Federal Building and post office) was placed at Washington Avenue and Fordham Road, with a final <b>design</b> <b>plan</b> created in 1967. It was to be named after Bronx House of Representatives member Charles A. Buckley, who oversaw the project, following Buckley's death in 1967. The project ultimately fell through due to federal opposition from the administration of President Richard Nixon, in part due to the plan to name the site after Buckley.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong's view of {{knowledge}} is that the conditions {{of knowledge}} are satisfied {{when you have a}} justified true belief that you arrived at through a reliable process: that is, the belief was caused by some factor in the external world (hence the label of externalism). Armstrong uses the analogy of a thermometer: as a thermometer changes to reflect the temperature of the environment it is in, so must one's beliefs if they are reliably formed. The connection between knowledge and the external world, for Armstrong, is a nomological relationship (that is, a law of nature relationship). Here, Armstrong's view is broadly similar to that of Alvin Goldman and Robert Nozick. The intuitions that lead to this kind of externalism led Alvin Plantinga towards an account of knowledge that added the requirement for 'properly-functioning' cognitive systems operating according to a <b>design</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|E
25|$|Under {{the plan}} {{approved}} in 2006, the Husky Stadium station would have three entrances, connected via underground walkways or overpasses: {{on the east}} side of Montlake Boulevard adjacent to Husky Stadium; on the north side of Pacific Place on the Burke-Gilman Trail; and on the west side of Montlake Boulevard near the University of Washington Medical Center. In 2007, the Seattle Design Commission recommended an overpass to cross Montlake Boulevard in lieu of the underground walkway, and Sound Transit updated the station's <b>design</b> <b>plan</b> accordingly with a bridge on the north side of the Rainier Vista triangle. The University of Washington unveiled its plans to redevelop the Rainier Vista triangle into a landscaped park, with a land bridge over Pacific Place, and requested that Sound Transit connect the station through a mid-block crosswalk instead of the bridge. The mid-block crosswalk was rejected by the FTA, and a compromise pedestrian overpass connecting to the center of the Rainier Vista triangle was adopted in 2011.|$|E
25|$|The American {{consulate}} {{building was}} designed by Burk, Lebreton and Lamantia of New Orleans, combining the American architecture of the 1960s and features of traditional South Indian architecture. The architecture of the consulate building was inspired from the traditional houses of Thanjavur and Karaikudi. The American architect hired to design the building traveled around South India in search of inspiration before zeroing in on the final theme. As quoted by S. Krishnan, who accompanied Lamantia on his architectural quest in Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh, Lamantia, whose roots were in Don Quixote's village, chose {{the architecture of the}} traditional houses of Thanjavur and Chettinad to blend with the American style in his <b>design</b> <b>plan.</b> Thus, the rectangular Consulate General building was built around a roofless central courtyard, with verandahs running around it and rooms opening out of them. In addition, inspired by the South Indian temple architecture, the four exterior walls were studded with chips of Pallavaram granite.|$|E

25|$|Capt. Robert G. Coman {{reported}} as Lafayettes prospective commanding officer on 31 January 1942, overseeing a skeleton engineering force numbering 458 men. The complicated nature and enormous {{size of the}} conversion effort prevented Coman's crew from adhering to the original schedule; crew familiarization with the vessel was an issue, and additional crew members were arriving to assist the effort. On 6 February 1942, {{a request for a}} two-week delay for the first sailing of Lafayette, originally scheduled for 14 February, was submitted to the Assistant Chief of Naval Operations. On that day, a schedule extension was granted due to a <b>design</b> <b>plan</b> change: elements of the superstructure were to be removed to improve stability, in work that was expected to take another 60 to 90 days. However, on 7 February, orders came from Washington that the reduction of the top-hamper had been abandoned and Lafayette was to sail on 14 February as planned. This abrupt reversal necessitated a frantic resumption of conversion work, and Capts Coman and Simmers scheduled 9 February meetings in New York and Washington to lobby for further clarification of conversion plans; ultimately, these meetings would never take place.|$|E

500|$|The {{newly elected}} Kennedy {{administration}} indicated on February 16, 1961, {{that it was}} anxious to retain the existing historic homes on Lafayette Square. In November, the Committee of 100 on the Federal City (an influential group of city leaders) asked President Kennedy to save and restore all the remaining buildings on Lafayette Square. In February 1962, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy lobbied General Services Administration (GSA) director Bernard L. Boutin to stop the demolition and adopt a different <b>design</b> <b>plan.</b> [...] "The wreckers haven't started yet, and until they do it can be saved," [...] she wrote. [...] Mrs. Kennedy enlisted architect John Carl Warnecke, a friend of her husband's {{who happened to be}} in town that weekend, to create a design which would incorporate the new buildings with the old. Warnecke conceived the basic design over that weekend, and worked closely with Mrs. Kennedy {{over the next few months}} to formalize the design proposal. The design was presented to the public and the Commission of Fine Arts (which had approval over any plan) in October 1962, and with Mrs. Kennedy's backing the Commission adopted the revised Warnecke design proposal.|$|E
