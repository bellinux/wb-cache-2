Our emphasis is not so much on these impacts, or on techniques to rehabilitate wetlands after such disturbance, but on creating wetlands as a form of rehabilitation of mined lands rather than returning them to agricultural or forest production.

40|$|Initial {{vegetation}} <b>establishment</b> <b>on</b> highly exposed {{sites such}} as mined land can be affected by climatic extremes, including extremes in temperature, evaporative demand, moisture availbility, wind and water erosion. The application of mulch over the substrate surfave is one ameliorative strategy {{with the potential to}} reduce the severity of these extremes. This paper reports on the results of two studies that assessed the effect of mulch on the initial phase of vegetation <b>establishment</b> <b>on</b> mined <b>land.</b> Afield trial at Mount Owen Coal Mine in the Hunter Valley, NSW assessed the effect of wood chip mulch and and logs 1 - 2 m in length. At Mount Morgan Mine in Central Queensland, the effect of wood chip mulch, hay and a grass cover crop was assessed. At both mine sites, mulch, when applied as a thin layer of wood chips, significantly increased the density of vegetation that established. Increased plant density resulted from over twice the seedling emergence on wood chip plots at both sites. Plant survival could also be enhanced in the mulch plots, but this was apparently dependent <b>on</b> the initial <b>establishment</b> density and seasonal rainfall. Chip mulch enhanced seedling emergence by an increase in substrate temperature on wood chip plots. The use of a thin layer of wood chip mulch over the substrate surface is therefore recommended on highly disturbed sites, in order to maximise native vegetation establishment from sown seeds and to optimise the efficient use of available seed resources...|$|R
50|$|Tropical {{hardwood}} hammocks {{can also}} be restored {{where they have been}} destroyed. Atestament to this is the fact that virtually all of the tropical hardwood hammocks in the Florida Keys are secondary and have recovered following clearing for agriculture and settlements. Craighead (1971) pointed out that hammocks on Elliott and Rhodes keys had recovered well after 35 years of natural regeneration. Tropical hardwood hammocks {{can also be}}come established in areas of pine rockland that has been cleared and then abandoned. Some of these forests have become so well established that only well-trained botanists can distinguish them from natural forests. Secondary forests can be useful for wildlife, even at a relatively young age. Key Largo woodrats and the Schaus swallowtail butterfly both utilize relatively young secondary forests in the Florida Keys. Unfortunately, the period when tropical hardwood hammocks could become established through natural regeneration and <b>establishment</b> <b>on</b> disturbed <b>lands</b> is probably at an end due to the invasion of South Florida by exotic plant species. Any site that is abandoned to vegetational succession will almost certainly become dominated by exotic pest plant species, especially if a seed source for exotics is nearby. Opportunities to use natural regeneration to establish or re-establish tropical hardwood hammocks and to establish wildlife habitat, however, should be explored.|$|R

This study's objectives were to test the applicability of soybean and weeping love grass as companion plants for assisting Pinus patula <b>establishment</b> <b>on</b> former agricultural <b>lands</b> (oldlands), and their capacity for suppressing growth of weedy species. Two experimental trials were conducted which involved growing pine, soybean, weeping love grass {{and an assortment of}} weedy species in monocultures and mixtures in pots containing oldland and plantation soils. Pine height and stem diameter were measured at monthly intervals, with total biomass accumulation in all taxa determined 14 months after planting. In the presence of soybean, both shoot and root growth of pine seedlings were enhanced, but root growth was reduced in the presence of weeping love grass. In the presence of the weedy species assortment, pine stem diameter, height, shoot and root biomass were all decreased. In contrast, total biomass accumulation of both soybean and weeping love grass was unaffected by the presence of the weed species assortment. However, the total biomass of this assortment was reduced in the presence of these two species.

30|$|When {{selecting}} between {{natural or}} novel rehabilitation outcomes, this RE approach assumes that geomorphological processes will {{have resulted in}} a land surface with a relatively predictable pattern of variation in soil characteristics (cf. Table  1), resulting in a predictable vegetation community (Burgess 2003). If quantitative comparison of the abiotic characteristics of the disturbed landscape and that of the known historical RE (predicted or extant) do not correspond within defined limits (Burgess 2003; Tongway and Ludwig 2011), {{it may be necessary to}} consider an alternative or hybrid vegetation association for <b>establishment</b> <b>on</b> that <b>land</b> unit—preferably one that incorporates multiple components from the historical landscape while also accommodating potentially novel or non-natural elements (e.g. waste rock heaps and open pits) based on landform components found within the RE. Ideally, pre-mine planning (Warhurst and Noromba 2010) would predict the range of landforms and lithologies that could be assembled in the final landscape to ensure that the rehabilitation outcome aligns as closely as possible with the essential function and attributes found nearby or more broadly within the RE (Worrall et al. 2009). By definition, further rehabilitation inputs invested over time could facilitate the restoration of pre-disturbance landform criteria among hybrid ecosystems; however, this goal cannot be claimed for novel ecosystems given the irreversible crossing of abiotic thresholds (Hobbs et al. 2013). Nevertheless, the approach would still be conducive to the development of rehabilitated ecosystems bearing features and capabilities similar to those found within the broader bioregional mosaic.|$|R
40|$|After {{tropical}} forest disturbance, mycorrhizal inoculum could be insufficient. Increasing mycorrhizal density through inoculum addition is then crucial for successful regeneration of deforested lands. Greenhouse bioassays {{were set up}} to determine the effectiveness of native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in soils from different disturbance stages on the growth of three important timber species, Terminalia superba, Distemonanthus benthamianus, and Entandrophragma utile. Soils were collected from late and early successional forest stands, fields of food crops, fallow of Chromolaena odorata, skid trails, bare soil landings, and landings with the pioneer tree Musanga cecropioides. These soils were used to grow seedlings without or with addition of an inoculum collected under the grass Paspalum conjugatum. The extent to which seedlings responded to indigenous inoculum and inoculum addition varied with tree species and with mycorrhizal inoculum potential. After inoculum addition, Terminalia strongly increased root colonization with a small increase in shoot dry weight and Distemonanthus hardly increased root colonization but showed a strong increase in shoot dry weight. Entandrophragma increased both root colonization and shoot dry weight. Plant biomass was lower in soils with low inoculum potential such as late successional stands, skid trails, and both kinds of landings; the mycorrhizal inoculation effect was then large. Plant biomass was high in agricultural fields and fallow; mycorrhizal inoculation effect was sometimes even negative. These data indicate that low inoculum might limit plant re-establishment after disturbance and that mycorrhizal inoculation has a potential for improving seedling <b>establishment</b> <b>on</b> deforested <b>land...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungi (AMF) have mutualistic {{relationships with}} more than 80 % of terrestrial plant species. This symbiotic relationship is ancient and would have had important roles in <b>establishment</b> of plants <b>on</b> <b>land.</b> Despite their abundance and wide range of relationship with plant species, AMF have shown low species diversity. However, molecular {{studies have suggested that}} diversity of these fungi may be much higher, and genetic variation of AMF is very high within a species and even within a single spore. Despite low diversity and lack of host specificity, various functions have been associated with plant growth responses to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal colonization. In addition, different community composition of AMF affects plants differently, and plays a potential role in ecosystem variability and productivity. AMF have high functional diversity because different combinations of host plants and AMF have different effects on the various aspects of symbiosis. Consequently, recent studies have focused on the different functions of AMF according to their genetic resource and their roles in ecosystem functioning. This review summarizes taxonomic, genetic, and functional diversities of AMF and their roles in natural ecosystems...|$|R

When the articles of capitulation came to be correctly translated and published, there were passages in them derogatory to the honor of Washington and his troops, and, which, it would seem, had purposely been inserted for their humiliation by the French commander; but which, they protested, had never been rightly translated by Van Braam. For instance, in the written articles, they were made to stipulate that for the space of a year, they would not work <b>on</b> any <b>establishment</b> beyond the mountains; whereas it had been translated by Van Braam [...] "on any <b>establishment</b> <b>on</b> the <b>lands</b> of the King of France" [...] which was quite another thing, as most of the land beyond the mountains was considered by them as belonging to the British crown. There were other points, of minor importance, relative to the disposition of the artillery; but the most startling and objectionable one was that concerning the previous skirmish in the Great Meadows. This was mentioned in the written articles as l'assassinat du Sieur de Jumonville, that is to say, the murder of De Jumonville; an expression from which Washington and his officers would have revolted with scorn and indignation; and which, if truly translated, would in all probability have caused the capitulation to be sent back instantly to the French commander. On the contrary, they declared it had been translated to them by Van Braam the death of De Jumonville.|$|R

The municipality refused the request to re-zone the land after conducting an extensive study and providing detailed reasons for the decision, which primarily related to residential tax rates. The congregation responded to the municipality's decision by finding a different piece of land and again applied for rezoning of that land. The municipality then summarily denied that rezoning application, noting only that P-3 land was available elsewhere. When the congregation was again unable to find suitable land zoned P-3, after a four-year-long search, they applied for a third time to the municipality to rezone a piece of land which they could purchase. The municipality again summarily denied their application without providing reasons. At this point, the congregation turned to the courts to challenge the fairness of the municipality's decision.|$|R

However, archaeological excavation has shown no evidence of this, and Æthelberht's connection with Reculver may be no more than a product of legend. In 2001 the historian Harold Gough noted speculation that the king may instead have taken up residence at Ford, since it lay on the Roman road between Canterbury and Reculver, and was included in the estate centred on Reculver that was given by King Ecgberht of Kent to Bassa the mass-priest for the foundation of St Mary's Church, Reculver, in 669. Ford was also included in the Reculver estate when King Eadred gave it to Archbishop Oda of Canterbury in 949. In 1800 the historian Edward Hasted wrote that Ford Palace [...] "appears to have been the most antient palace, excepting that of Canterbury, which had been erected for the archiepiscopal residence", described it as [...] "parcel of the antient possessions of the see of Canterbury", and placed its <b>establishment</b> [...] "probably <b>on</b> <b>lands</b> given to archiepiscopate sometime before the Norman conquest".
