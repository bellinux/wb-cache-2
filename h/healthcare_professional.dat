40|$|Aims {{and method}} To compare attitudes towards mental {{disorders}} in professionals working {{in mental health}} and professionals working in different areas of medicine. Levels of emotional empathy in both groups were also investigated. In total, 58 mental <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> and 60 non-mental <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> completed our attitudes towards mental disorders questionnaire and Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale. Results The results reveal generally positive attitudes towards people with mental disorders in both groups. Non-mental <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> regarded people with a mental disorder as significantly more dangerous and unpredictable than did mental <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals.</b> There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in emotional empathy between the two groups.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of self-reported hand eczema among <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> in the Netherlands, and to investigate absenteeism and presenteeism resulting from hand eczema. METHODS: A questionnaire-based observational study was performed. Participants were recruited from hospitals and nursing homes in the Netherlands. The study population consisted of 1232 <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals.</b> We used the NOSQ- 2002 to measure hand eczema and the PRODISQ for absenteeism and presenteeism. RESULTS: The 1 -year prevalence of hand eczema among <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> was 12 %. Among all participants, 47 % reported symptoms related to hand eczema.

40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the level of job satisfaction of <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> in South Africa. The exact proof depends on a delegate sample of pharmacists, nurses, and doctors in South Africa who took part in the study. The self-administered questionnaires were distributed through the use of email, fax, and delivery by hand. This study found that more than 50 % of the <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> in South Africa are not satisfied with their salary, benefits, work progression, and work accomplishment recognition. <b>Healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> in South Africa differ in terms of the level of job satisfaction. There is no difference between <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> working in private hospitals or in public hospitals, rural or urban areas when it comes to job satisfaction. Principal limitations are imminent in a study of this nature. Since the study tool utilised was self-administered, the details given by participants are constructed on their appreciation. Despite that respondents were certain of confidentiality; it is subsequently practicable that they may choose to give a precise response or the opposite in terms of their level of satisfaction. There is a probability that responses of every person who did not take part in the study may have given a different perspective in comparison to those who took part in the study. This study concludes that <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> in South Africa are not satisfied with their salaries, benefits, work progression and work accomplishment recognition but are satisfied with job security. The number of women <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> is considerably higher than the number of men <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> in South Africa. In South Africa, many <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> prefer working in urban regions rather than rural territories and the majority of <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> are working in the public sector. The findings supplement the current literature, and incorporate new ideas concerning understanding the explanations for the level of satisfaction of <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals.</b> The study results will help stakeholders to re-examine the retention strategy of <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> in South Africa...|$|R

A user-centred design is integral if mHealth is to be embraced by patients and <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the perspectives of individuals with asthma and <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> on the use of mHealth for asthma self-management. We used a sequential exploratory mixed methods design; focus groups informed the development of questionnaires, which were disseminated to individuals with asthma and <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals.</b> Focus group participants (18 asthma patients and five <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals)</b> identified 12 potential uses of mHealth. Questionnaire results showed that individuals with asthma (n= 186) most frequently requested an mHealth system to monitor asthma over time (72 %) and to collect data to present to healthcare teams (70 %). In contrast, <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> (n= 63) most frequently selected a system alerting patients to deteriorating asthma control (86 %) and advising them when to seek medical attention (87 %). Individuals with asthma were less likely than <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> (p< 0. 001) to believe that assessing medication adherence and inhaler technique could improve asthma control. Our data provide strong support for mHealth for asthma self-management, but highlight fundamental differences between the perspectives of patients and <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Effective {{delivery}} {{of health care}} is dependent on health manpower. In Thailand, an insufficiency of human resources relates to an inequitable distribution of <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> rather than to insufficiencies overall. Both internal and external factors influence healthcare professionals' choice of where to work, although perceptions rather than actual circumstances are more influential in their decision-making process. This inequitable distribution of <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> in Thailand affects rural areas {{and the provision of}} primary health care. Objectives: To understand the subjective perceptions, attitudes and dynamics among <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> regarding where they seek employment and the impact on the provision of primary care. Design: Questionnaire survey among Thai <b>healthcare</b> students and <b>professionals</b> and semi-structured interviews with <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> investigating attitudes and perceptions. Setting: Thai rural, urban and metropolitan areas. Results: An interesting mix of factors influences <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> with regard to where they seek employment, or continue their employment. Family and community commitments, social status and a sense of belonging were associated with <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> seeking employment in their province of origin. Tensions are also emerging between preventative and curative health. These tensions, together with financial remuneration and professional development opportunities and promotions, as perceived by <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals</b> themselves, have implications for current and future healthcare policy. Conclusion: The scaling up of human resources for health in Thailand will not, based on past experiences and attitudes outlined in this research, ensure an equitable distribution of <b>healthcare</b> <b>professionals.</b> Further consideration of these professionals' expectations of being able to work in areas close to their families and of sufficient financial remuneration is required. It is likely that rural regions and the {{delivery of}} primary care will be negatively affected by continued inequities.
