40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to minimize the expected present worth of the production costs incurred over the opera-tional life of a robotic assembly system that is integrated with an Automatic Storage/Retrieval System (AS/RS). Produc-tion costs include inventory cost and capital cost of equipment. Inventory cost consists of ordering, holding, and lost-production costs; and all of these costs depend on the scheduling policy for the assembly robots as well as the inventory policy for the AS/RS. Capital cost of equipment depends on the number of <b>depalletizer</b> obots and the number of assembly robots. To identify the minimum-cost design for a certain automotive assembly operation from a given set of alternative system configurations, we present a simulation experiment in which independent replications of each alternative are con-trolled by a statistical ranking-and-selection procedure that has been adapted to simulation. 1...|$|E
40|$|Delivery {{centers are}} {{facilities}} for making shipment of {{many kinds of}} products from factories to commission agents or retail shops. In this research, we deal with a design problem of material flow in the delivery center. The problem can be expressed as follows: determining the sizes of the automatic warehouses, the number of warehouse cranes, that of <b>depalletizers</b> and robots, and the flow volume among these equipments. Flow in the delivery center is shown in Fig. 1 : (1) the pallets of the products from factories enter in the automatic warehouse. (2) <b>Depalletizers</b> and/or robots divide the pallets into the cases. (3) The cases temporally enter in the automatic warehouses for cases, and (4) the demanded number of cases are delivered outside of the center. We propose three time-constant flow models as shown in Fig. 2 to Fig. 4. Here, the products are divided into rank A and rank B products {{from the viewpoint of}} the amount of the delivered products. Flow of the rank A products is again divided into two based on the time slots of transportation: flows during the order and the delivery completion (Fig. 2), and those during the delivery completion and the next order (Fig. 3). The flows for the rank B products are shown in Fig. 4. The design problem is solved by integrating the three flow models, and by solving it as mixed integer programming problem. The algorithm is implemented for an Intel Pentium M 900 computer. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is shown by using real transport data. Calculation costs are only about 5 minutes for about 50 various lead time inputs...|$|R

In this research, we deal with a design problem of material flow in the delivery center. The problem can be expressed as follows: determining the sizes of the automatic warehouses, the number of warehouse cranes, that of <b>depalletizers</b> and robots, and the flow volume among these equipments. An overview of a delivery center, and design objects are shown in Fig. 1. In recent years, some delivery centers have been completely automated to improve the operational costs and shipping efficiency. We propose an extended network flow model in which each device represents a node of the network flow and the conveyed products correspond to the flow within the model. Figure 2, 3 represent the proposed model. When designing a delivery center, {{it is necessary to}} determine the appropriate number of devices, the flow among the devices, device-layout, etc. while holding the costs down and satisfying the demand throughput. In the proposed network flow model, several binding clauses exist between nodes and arcs. These clauses are represented as linear constraints. Under these constraints, the number of machines and the flow volume should be optimized. Thi...|$|R
