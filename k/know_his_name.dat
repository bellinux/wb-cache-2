500|$|The boy was curious, {{he was a}} big Munnabhai fan {{and kept}} asking the name of the film. The first working title was 'Munnabhai Meets Mahatma Gandhi,' and Shantanu (Moitra, the music director) told him. So he said, 'Munnabhai to theek hai, yeh Mahatma Gandhi kaun hai?' ('Munnabhai is fine, but who is this Mahatma Gandhi?') So this is the sad state of affairs today. I was shocked. And it's not just the chai-wallah. A few days ago on TV a lot of {{politicians}} were asked India-related questions on the news channels, and I can't believe a lot of them don't know 2 October is Gandhiji's birthday!

In 1993, Nancy Reichardt of The Los Angeles Times stated: [...] "Victor Newman is one of those characters.

The Contemporary Resort Hotel and Polynesian Village were also completed {{in time for the}} park's opening on October 1, 1971.

2500|$|Ping, Pong, and Pang {{appear and}} offer the Prince women and riches {{if he will}} only give up Turandot (Tu che guardi le stelle), but he refuses. A group of {{soldiers}} then drag in Timur and Liù. They have been seen speaking to the Prince, so they must <b>know</b> <b>his</b> <b>name.</b> Turandot enters and orders Timur and Liù to speak. The Prince feigns ignorance, saying they know nothing. But when the guards begin to treat Timur harshly, Liù declares that she alone knows the Prince's name, but she will not reveal it. Ping demands the Prince's name, and when Liù refuses to say it, she is tortured. Turandot is clearly taken aback by Liù's resolve and asks Liù who or what gave her such a strong resolve. Liù answers, [...] "Princess, love!" [...] (Principessa, amore!). Turandot demands that Ping tear the Prince's name from Liù, and Ping orders Liù to be tortured even more. Liù counters Turandot (Tu che di gel sei cinta – [...] "You who are begirdled by ice"), saying that Turandot too will learn the exquisite joy of being guided by caring and compassionate love. Having spoken, Liù seizes a dagger from a soldier's belt and stabs herself. As she staggers towards the Prince and falls dead, the crowd screams for her to speak the Prince's name. Since Timur is blind, he must be told about Liù's death, and he cries out in anguish. When Timur warns that the gods will be offended by Liù's death, the crowd becomes subdued, very afraid and ashamed. The grieving Timur and the crowd follow Liù's body as it is carried away. Everybody departs, leaving the Prince and Turandot alone. He reproaches Turandot for her cruelty (Duet – The Prince, Turandot: Principessa di morte – [...] "Princess of death"), then takes {{her in his arms}} and kisses her in spite of her resistance.|$|E
