5|$|Mars has a {{relatively}} pronounced orbital <b>eccentricity</b> of about 0.09; {{of the seven}} other planets in the Solar System, only Mercury has a larger orbital <b>eccentricity.</b> It is known that in the past, Mars has had a much more circular orbit. At one point, 1.35 million Earth years ago, Mars had an <b>eccentricity</b> of roughly 0.002, much {{less than that of}} Earth today. Mars's cycle of <b>eccentricity</b> is 96,000 Earth years compared to Earth's cycle of 100,000 years. Mars has a much longer cycle of <b>eccentricity,</b> with a period of 2.2 million Earth years, and this overshadows the 96,000-year cycle in the <b>eccentricity</b> graphs. For the last 35,000 years, the orbit of Mars has been getting slightly more eccentric because of the gravitational effects of the other planets. The closest distance between Earth and Mars will continue to mildly decrease for the next 25,000 years.|$|E

We show that in the limit of fluctuation dominance all of the n{m}’s are approximately equal for m ≥ 4. For dynamics linearly responding to these <b>eccentricities</b> such as hydrodynamics or proposed in this paper weakly interacting field theory, these relations among <b>eccentricities</b> are translated into relations among flow moments vn{m}.

50|$|Most of the Solar System's asteroids have orbital <b>eccentricities</b> between 0 and 0.35 with {{an average}} value of 0.17. Their {{comparatively}} high <b>eccentricities</b> are {{probably due to the}} influence of Jupiter and to past collisions.|$|R
40|$|Finite element {{analyses}} were performed to investigate theoretically the effects of in-plane and out-of plane <b>eccentricities,</b> bending or twisting, and thickness nonuniformity on the axial stress and strain variations across the width of off-axis specimens.

Guidelines for detecting and minimizing the presence of <b>eccentricities</b> are described...|$|R
5|$|Of all the {{measured}} parameters for this planet, the value for orbital <b>eccentricity</b> {{is the most}} uncertain. The frequently cited value of 0.7 for Epsilon Eridanib's <b>eccentricity</b> is inconsistent {{with the presence of}} the proposed asteroid belt at a distance of 3AU. If the <b>eccentricity</b> was actually this high, the planet would pass through the asteroid belt and clear it out within about ten thousand years. If the belt has existed for longer than this period, which appears likely, it imposes an upper limit on Epsilon Eridanib's <b>eccentricity</b> of about 0.10–0.15. If the dust disk is instead being generated from the outer debris disk, rather than from collisions in an asteroid belt, then no constraints on the planet's orbital <b>eccentricity</b> are needed to explain the dust distribution.|$|E
5|$|The current Laplace {{resonance}} {{is unable}} to pump the orbital <b>eccentricity</b> of Ganymede to a higher value. The value of about 0.0013 is probably a remnant from a previous epoch, when such pumping was possible. The Ganymedian orbital <b>eccentricity</b> is somewhat puzzling; {{if it is not}} pumped now it should have decayed long ago due to the tidal dissipation in the interior of Ganymede. This means that the last episode of the <b>eccentricity</b> excitation happened only several hundred million years ago. Because Ganymede's orbital <b>eccentricity</b> is relatively low—on average 0.0015—tidal heating is negligible now. However, in the past Ganymede may have passed through one or more Laplace-like resonances that were able to pump the orbital <b>eccentricity</b> to a value as high as 0.01–0.02. This probably caused a significant tidal heating of the interior of Ganymede; the formation of the grooved terrain may be a result of one or more heating episodes.|$|E
5|$|Amalthea orbits Jupiter at a {{distance}} of 181000km (2.54Jupiter radii). The orbit of Amalthea has an <b>eccentricity</b> of 0.003 and an inclination of 0.37° relative to the equator of Jupiter. Such appreciably nonzero values of inclination and <b>eccentricity,</b> though still small, are unusual for an inner satellite and {{can be explained by the}} influence of the innermost Galilean satellite, Io: in the past Amalthea has passed through several mean-motion resonances with Io that have excited its inclination and <b>eccentricity</b> (in a mean-motion resonance the ratio of orbital periods of two bodies is a rational number like m:n).|$|E

40|$|The {{resonant}} {{structure of}} Io leads to forced <b>eccentricities</b> that are considerably {{larger than the}} free values. Although still modest by all standards, these forced <b>eccentricities</b> coupled with the enormous tides induced by Jupiter lead to magnitudes of tidal dissipation that are large enough to completely dominate the thermal history of Io. In the present paper, the forced <b>eccentricities</b> are calculated and then substituted into an expression for the total tidal dissipation. The results point {{to the possibility that}} the dissipation of tidal energy in Io may have melted a major fraction of Io's mass...|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} and reliability of proper orbital elements are studied. The orbits of a numerically simulated family of asteroids and {{the behavior of the}} proper <b>eccentricities</b> and inclinations are analyzed. The reconstruction of the initial ejection velocities from the linear theory proper elements of the simulated families is described. Long-period variations are detected for asteroid families with small <b>eccentricities</b> and inclinations, and strong disturbances are also observed. The data reveal that these variations affect the proper <b>eccentricities</b> and inclinations and reduce the {{accuracy and}} reliability of the proper orbital elements to define asteroid families...|$|R
5|$|In 1927, the Canadian {{astronomer}} William E. Harper {{used this}} technique {{to measure the}} period of this single-line spectroscopic binary and determined it to be 21.724 days. He also initially estimated the orbital <b>eccentricity</b> as 0.027. (Later estimates gave an <b>eccentricity</b> of essentially zero, which is the value for a circular orbit.) The velocity amplitude was measured as 41.5 km/s, which is the maximum velocity of the primary component {{along the line of}} sight to the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Newton's theorem {{describes}} {{only the}} effects of adding an inverse-cube central force. However, Newton extends his theorem to an arbitrary central forces F(r) by restricting his attention to orbits that are nearly circular, such as ellipses with low orbital <b>eccentricity</b> (ε ≤ 0.1), which is true of seven of the eight planetary orbits in the solar system. Newton also applied his theorem to the planet Mercury, which has an <b>eccentricity</b> ε of roughly 0.21, and suggested that it may pertain to Halley's comet, whose orbit has an <b>eccentricity</b> of roughly 0.97.|$|E
5|$|The high <b>eccentricity</b> of the planet's orbit {{suggests}} {{that either the}} Kozai mechanism (there is an exchange between the inclination of a planet and its <b>eccentricity)</b> is at work, or that the planet's orbit was distorted by the unstable orbit of other planets {{that used to be}} part of the HD 154672 system.|$|E

Gliese 3634 b has an <b>eccentricity</b> of 0.08, giving it a mostly circular orbit. In comparison, planet Mercury lies 0.387 AU from the Sun, orbits every 87.97 days, and has an orbital <b>eccentricity</b> of 0.2056.|$|E
5|$|The secular {{effects of}} a distant massive planet alters this behavior, causing the longitudes of {{perihelion}} of anti-aligned objects to librate, or oscillate within a limited range of values, while their perihelia rise and fall. As the angle between an anti-aligned object's perihelion and Planet Nine's (delta longitude of perihelion on diagram) climbs beyond 180° Planet Nine exerts an increasingly positive torque on the object. This torque increases the object's angular momentum, causing the <b>eccentricity</b> of its orbit to decline (see blue curves on diagram) and its perihelion to rise away from Neptune's orbit. While the object's <b>eccentricity</b> is declining its precession rate is slowing. Once the object's precession rate becomes slower than that of Planet Nine delta longitude of perihelion begins to descend. After delta longitude of perihelion drops below 180° the object begins to feel an increasingly negative torque. This causes the object's angular momentum to decrease, and its <b>eccentricity</b> grows and perihelion falls. When the object's <b>eccentricity</b> is again large, its precession rate increases, causing delta longitude of perihelion to climb toward 180°, returning the object to its original orbit.|$|E
5|$|Uranus's {{irregular}} moons {{range in}} size from 120–200km (Sycorax) to about 20km (Trinculo). Unlike Jupiter's irregulars, Uranus's show no correlation of axis with inclination. Instead, the retrograde moons can be divided into two groups based on axis/orbital <b>eccentricity.</b> The inner group includes those satellites closer to Uranus (a < 0.15 rH) and moderately eccentric (~0.2), namely Francisco, Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo. The outer group (a > 0.15 rH) includes satellites with high <b>eccentricity</b> (~0.5): Sycorax, Prospero, Setebos, and Ferdinand.|$|E

5|$|Currently Umbriel is not {{involved}} in any orbital resonance with other Uranian satellites. Early in its history, however, it may have been in a 1:3 resonance with Miranda. This would have increased Miranda's orbital <b>eccentricity,</b> contributing to the internal heating and geological activity of that moon, while Umbriel's orbit would have been less affected. Due to Uranus's lower oblateness and smaller size relative to its satellites, its moons can escape more easily from a mean motion resonance than those of Jupiter or Saturn. After Miranda escaped from this resonance (through a mechanism that probably resulted in its anomalously high orbital inclination), its <b>eccentricity</b> would have been damped, turning off the heat source.|$|E
5|$|Enceladus {{is one of}} {{the major}} inner {{satellites}} of Saturn along with Dione, Tethys, and Mimas. It orbits at 238,000km from Saturn's center and 180,000km from its cloud tops, between the orbits of Mimas and Tethys. It orbits Saturn every 32.9 hours, fast enough for its motion to be observed over a single night of observation. Enceladus is currently in a 2:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with Dione, completing two orbits around Saturn for every one orbit completed by Dione. This resonance maintains Enceladus's orbital <b>eccentricity</b> (0.0047), which is known as a forced <b>eccentricity.</b> This non-zero <b>eccentricity</b> results in tidal deformation of Enceladus. The dissipated heat resulting from this deformation is the main heating source for Enceladus's geologic activity. Enceladus orbits within the densest part of Saturn's E ring, the outermost of its major rings, and is the main source of the ring's material composition.|$|E
