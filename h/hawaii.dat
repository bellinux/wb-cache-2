40|$|The {{survival}} of <b>Hawaii’s</b> longline fisheries {{has recently been}} brought into question by environmental issues. This paper examines the linkages between <b>Hawaii’s</b> fisheries sectors {{and the rest of}} the economy and evaluates the potential economic impacts of regulations on <b>Hawaii’s</b> longline fisheries. Using standard linkage indicators suggested in Cai and Leung (2004), we analyzed the linkages of <b>Hawaii’s</b> fishing industry in 1992 and 1997. We found no significant change in linkage patterns for <b>Hawaii’s</b> fisheries sectors between the two years. We also found that <b>Hawaii’s</b> fisheries sectors have strong linkages to the rest of the economy and any regulations imposed on fisheries will have profound economic impacts. 3...|$|R

5|$|In <b>Hawaii,</b> Blaine {{worked to}} bind the kingdom {{more closely to}} the United States and to avoid its {{becoming}} a British protectorate. When the McKinley Tariff of 1890 eliminated the duty on sugar, Hawaiian sugar-growers looked {{for a way to}} retain their once-exclusive access to the American market. The Hawaiian minister to the United States, Henry A. P. Carter, tried to arrange for <b>Hawaii</b> have complete trade reciprocity with the United States, but Blaine proposed instead that <b>Hawaii</b> become an American protectorate; Carter favored the idea, but the Hawaiian king, Kalākaua, rejected the infringement on his sovereignty. Blaine next procured the appointment of his former newspaper colleague John L. Stevens as minister to <b>Hawaii.</b> Stevens had long believed that the United States should annex <b>Hawaii,</b> and as minister he co-operated with Americans living in <b>Hawaii</b> in their efforts to bring about annexation. Their efforts ultimately culminated in a coup d'état against Kalākaua’s successor, Liliuokalani, in 1893. Blaine’s precise involvement is undocumented, but the results of Stevens’ diplomacy were in accord with his ambitions for American power in the region. The new government petitioned the United States for annexation, but by that time Blaine was no longer in office.|$|E
5|$|In Maui County, the Hawai'i Department of Education ordered for {{the closure}} of all schools and the {{designation}} of some facilities as emergency shelters. All public schools in <b>Hawaii</b> County were also closed by the department. Both the University of <b>Hawaii</b> and the <b>Hawaii</b> Community College closed their campuses during Iselle's passage. The Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources closed all of its managed lands in <b>Hawaii</b> and Maui counties and closed some of its campgrounds and wilderness areas in Oahu and Kauai counties. All state offices and courthouses in <b>Hawaii</b> County were closed with the retention of only essential staff. Although Hawaiian Airlines did not cancel its flights, the company waived fees for passengers seeking to change from flights expected to service during Iselle's passage. United Airlines and Island Air later took the same accommodative measures. The latter later cancelled all of its inter-Hawaiian flights on August7, {{with the exception of}} flights serving Kauai; American Airlines and numerous other airlines would follow suit as the threat of Iselle neared. The Salvation Army readied its resources in preparation for relief operations for Iselle in <b>Hawaii.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Nevada's final {{regular season}} game, Kaepernick led the Wolf Pack in a second-half {{comeback}} to defeat Louisiana Tech.
