5|$|The Baltic Sea coast <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of Eurasian amber trade since prehistoric times (see Amber Road). Neolithic {{artifacts}} made {{of amber}} {{were discovered in}} nearby Juodkrantė in the 19th century - these artifacts unfortunately disappeared during the 20th century.

The albatrosses can {{be separated from the}} other Procellariiformes both genetically and through morphological characteristics, size, their legs, and the arrangement of their nasal tubes (see below: Morphology and flight).|$|E
5|$|Ever since Joseph Merrick's days as {{a novelty}} exhibit on Whitechapel Road, his {{condition}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of curiosity for medical professionals. His appearance at {{the meeting of the}} Pathological Society of London in 1884 drew interest from the doctors present, but none of the answers nor the attention that Treves had hoped for. The case received only a brief mention in the British Medical Journal, and the Lancet declined to mention it at all. Four months later, in 1885, Treves brought the case before the meeting for a second time. By then, Tom Norman's shop on Whitechapel Road had been closed, and the Elephant Man had moved on. Without Merrick, Treves made do with the photographs he had taken during his examinations. One of the doctors present at the meeting was Henry Radcliffe Crocker, a dermatologist who was an authority on skin diseases. After hearing Treves's description of Merrick, and viewing the photographs, Crocker proposed that Merrick's condition might be a combination of dermatolysis, pachydermatocele and an unnamed bone deformity, all caused by changes in the nervous system. Crocker wrote about Merrick's case in his 1888 book Diseases of the Skin: their Description, Pathology, Diagnosis and Treatment.|$|E
