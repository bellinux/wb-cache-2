5|$|After {{graduating from}} Duke, Nixon {{initially}} hoped {{to join the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation. He received no response to his letter of application and learned years later {{that he had been}} hired, but his appointment had been canceled at the last minute due to budget cuts. Instead, he returned to California and was admitted to the bar in 1937. He began practicing with the law firm Wingert and Bewley in Whittier, working on commercial litigation for local petroleum companies and other corporate matters, as well as on wills. In later years, Nixon proudly stated that he was the only modern president to have previously worked as a practicing attorney. Nixon was reluctant to work on divorce cases, disliking frank sexual talk from women. In 1938, <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> his own branch of Wingert and Bewley in La Habra, California, and became a full partner in the firm the following year.|$|E

After {{attending}} schools in Mount Forest, Ontario, Armstrong briefly became a schoolteacher before moving to Lion's Head, Ontario where entered the pharmacy business. Armstrong would also spend some time at Eastnor Township, Ontario, where he served on the town council and as treasurer, from 1903 to 1905. He then moved west and settle at the city of Edmonton, Alberta, in 1906. That same year <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> the Armstrong Drug Store, on Namayo Avenue and Boyle Street (presently 97 Street and 103 Avenue). In his early years in Edmonton he also involved himself in several real estate ventures and construction projects along with his brother, Gordon.|$|E

5|$|The southward {{expansion}} of the Han dynasty led to new trade routes and diplomatic contact with foreign kingdoms. In 111 BCE, Emperor Wu conquered the Kingdom of Nanyue {{in what is now}} modern northern Vietnam and Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan; thereafter <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> maritime trade to both Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, as foreign merchants brought lapis lazuli, pearls, jade, and glasswares to the Han Empire from this southern sea route. When a group of travelers from the Roman Empire (allegedly diplomats of Marcus Aurelius but most likely Roman merchants) came to the Han court in 166 CE, they allegedly came from this southern trade route. By at least the 1st century CE— as proven by Eastern Han ceramic miniature models of ships found in various tombs— the Chinese {{would have been able to}} brave distant waters with the new steering invention of the stern-mounted rudder. This came to replace the less efficient steering oar. While ancient China was home to various ship designs, including the layered and fortified tower ship meant for calm waters of lakes and river, the junk design (jun 船) created by the 1st century CE was China's first seaworthy sailing ship. The typical junk has a square-ended bow and stern, a flat-bottomed hull or carvel-shaped hull with no keel or sternpost, and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western seacrafts. Since the Chinese junk lacked a sternpost, the rudder was attached to the back of the ship by use of either socket-and-jaw or block and tackle (which differed from the later European pintle and gudgeon design of the 12th century). As written by a 3rd-century author, junks had for-and-aft rigs and lug sails.|$|E

25|$|The Guthrie's design arose out of Ralph Rapson's {{work with}} the Walker Art Center, and {{concepts}} the Walker was considering for a small auditorium near their museum. The result was a theater designed by Rapson, that seated 1,441 people when it first opened its doors in 1963. Its irregularly-shaped stage, designed by Tanya Moiseiwitsch, had 7 sides and took up 1120 square feet (104 m²). Seating radiated outward and upward, and the ceiling was hung with acoustical panels that carried the asymmetrical theme {{to the top of}} the theater. The design concept encouraged the use of a minimal use of large set pieces. In 1974 the distinctive exterior screen, which had suffered from corrosion by the elements over the years, was removed. In 1980 Artistic Director Liviu Ciulei redesigned the stage. The stage itself was modified so that its size, shape and height was adjustable, and <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> the back wall to create more depth.|$|E
25|$|Gung Ye first {{joined the}} troops of Gi Hwon in 891 but left shortly after as Gi Hwon {{did not fully}} trust him. Gung Ye joined Yang Gil's {{rebellion}} force in 892, and became leading general of the rebel forces by defeating the local Silla army and other rebel groups. Most local aristocrats of Myeongju and Paeseo, including Wang Gun, submitted to his force, making him even more powerful than his master Yang Gil. Silla, after nearly a millennium as a centralized kingdom was quickly declining, and Gung Ye instigated his own rebellion in present-day Kaesŏng in 898. After turning against his master, Yang Gil, He eventually defeated and subjugated him and other local lords in central Korea to proclaim himself king of Hugoguryeo in 901.With his rival Gyeon Hwon's Hubaekje {{taking control of the}} peninsula's southwest, <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> the Later Three Kingdoms period of Korean History, a reference to the so-called Three Kingdoms period of Korea, several centuries earlier.|$|E

50|$|Branko Cvetkovic (born 1951), a Slovenian {{photographer}} {{known for}} his philosophically conceptualized approach to photography. Working mostly with large-format cameras, his architecture photography is minimalistically structured. From symmetry <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>up</b> the space perspective to deconstructivism, and in art there is a transition to a non-perspective suprematist plane, thus coinciding with abstract expressionism. Besides space, his main concern is the phenomenon of light itself, the two basic postulates in photography.|$|R
25|$|In {{the evening}} of 7 June German {{aircraft}} bombed and destroyed an oil tank facility in the town. At around 0200hrs, before Nordkapp was ready to sail west and start five years of service in exile, two ships arrived at Svolvær and started destroying the remaining oil tanks with artillery fire. Assuming the ships to be German the second in command of Nordkapp, Ensign Andersen, who was {{in command of the}} ship as Lieutenant Commander Seip was in a conference on land at the time, sailed out and attacked the two unknown ships. As <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> on the two ships with his single cannon, they quickly returned fire and a 45-minute artillery duel ensued. Neither side managed to hit their adversary during the fight, and eventually the two sides discovered each other's true identity. The ships Nordkapp had been battling for three quarters of an hour were Ranen and the 655-ton Royal Navy ASW trawler Northern Gem. Ranen had been bombarding German positions together with Nordkapp just four days previously.|$|E
25|$|Nehru {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{nationalist}} leaders to realise the sufferings of the people in the states ruled by Indian princes. He suffered imprisonment in Nabha, a princely state, when he went there to see the struggle that was being waged by the Sikhs against the corrupt Mahants. The nationalist movement had been confined to the territories under direct British rule. He helped to make the struggle of the people in the princely states a part of the nationalist movement for independence. The All India States Peoples Conference was formed in 1927. Nehru who had been supporting the cause of the people of the princely states for many years was made the President of the conference in 1935. <b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> its ranks to membership from across the political spectrum. The body would play an important role during the political integration of India, helping Indian leaders Vallabhbhai Patel and V. P. Menon (to whom Nehru had delegated the task of integrating the princely states into India) negotiate with hundreds of princes.|$|E
25|$|Federer next {{traveled}} to Melbourne {{for the first}} Grand Slam of the season, the Australian Open. The Swiss advanced through the first four rounds without {{the loss of a}} set, starting his campaign by defeating qualifier Alexander Kudryavtsev, receiving a walkover into the third round when Andreas Beck withdrew with a lower back injury prior to their second round match, and beating Ivo Karlović to improve to a 10–1 head-to-head record against the Croat. Federer then faced Australian teenager Bernard Tomic and downed him in less than two hours to extend his record streak of Grand Slam quarterfinals consecutive appearances to 31. In the quarterfinals, Federer faced world no. 11 Juan Martín del Potro in his 1000th career match. It was their first meeting in a major tournament since Del Potro defeated Federer in five sets in the 2009 US Open men's final. As the tight match slowly progressed, Federer took control and flew by del Potro in straight sets. With his win, Federer becomes the first player at age 30 and over to reach the Australian Open semifinals since Andre Agassi, and extends his match winning streak (started in September 2011) to 24 consecutive victories. Federer played world no. 2 and archrival Rafael Nadal in the semifinals. <b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> the match by winning the first set, but ultimately lost momentum and dropped the next three sets after a failed attempt {{to get back in the}} match by taking the third set, committing 63 unforced errors. Federer's loss to Nadal saw his winning streak of 24 consecutive matches end and his record against Nadal slip to 9–18.|$|E

500|$|In the race, California Chrome had a clean {{start and}} could have taken the lead, but Espinoza kept him behind two speed horses and only moved him to the front at the final turn when other horses began to tire. In the homestretch, <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> a lead of five lengths before Espinoza eased him the last 70 yards of the race, {{narrowing}} his winning margin to [...] lengths.

500|$|On {{the same}} weekend {{as the more}} prestigious Milan–San Remo, to which the team was not invited, they picked up two wins in single-day races. Veilleux won La Roue Tourangelle beating 's Anthony Delaplace in a two-up sprint five seconds ahead of the main field. Chavanel led the field across the line, giving Europcar two out of the three podium spots. That same day, team leader Voeckler won Cholet-Pays de Loire by foiling a field sprint. With [...] left in the race, Voeckler went on the attack. <b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> a ten-second time gap very quickly and just held on to win, having no appreciable gap over the peloton at the finish. Since Cholet-Pays de Loire is a UCI Europe Tour race, Voeckler had to wear the all-white jersey of Europe Tour leader and not the French {{national}} champion's jersey, something which spectators expecting to see the tricolor jersey found absurd. While Voeckler was nonetheless happy to come away with a win, he stressed after the race {{that it was not}} Milan–San Remo, and that the victory should be viewed with the proper perspective.|$|E
500|$|Lynch had {{initially}} begun {{work on a}} script titled Gardenback, based on his painting of a hunched figure with vegetation growing from its back. Gardenback was a surrealist script about adultery, which featured a continually growing insect representing one man's lust for his neighbor. The script {{would have resulted in}} a roughly 45-minute-long film, which the AFI felt was too long for such a figurative, nonlinear script. In its place, Lynch presented Eraserhead, which he had developed based on a daydream of a man's head being taken to a pencil factory by a small boy. Several board members at the AFI were still opposed to producing such a surrealist work, but they were persuaded when Dean Frank Daniel threatened to resign if it were to be vetoed. Lynch's script for Eraserhead was influenced by his reading as a film student; Franz Kafka's 1915 novella The Metamorphosis and Nikolai Gogol's 1836 short story [...] "The Nose" [...] were strong influences on the screenplay. Lynch also confirmed in an interview with Metro Silicon Valley that the film [...] "came together" [...] when <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> a Bible, read one verse from it, and shut it; in retrospect, Lynch could not remember if the verse was from the Old Testament or the New Testament. In 2007, Lynch said [...] "Believe it or not, Eraserhead is my most spiritual film." ...|$|E
