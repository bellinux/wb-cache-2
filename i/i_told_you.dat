25|$|Hence, the {{combination}} of object te with subject você in informal BP: eu te disse para você ir (<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that you should go). In addition, in all the country, the imperative forms {{may also be the}} same as the formal second-person forms, but it is argued by some that it is the third-person singular indicative which doubles as the imperative: fala o que você fez instead of fale o que você fez ("say what you did").|$|E
25|$|And as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> {{these are}} the two {{secondary}} causes {{of the decline of}} art; the first being the loss of moral purpose. Pray note them clearly. In mediæval art, thought is the first thing, execution the second; in modern art execution is the first thing, and thought the second. And again, in mediæval art, truth is first, beauty second; in modern art, beauty is first, truth second. The mediæval principles led up to Raphael, and the modern principles lead down from him.|$|E

25|$|Doug Walters {{went to the}} wicket when Australia's total {{stood at}} 4/192 just before tea and played his shots to such telling effect that, by the time stumps arrived, he had scored 103...He opened the dressing-room door, expecting a flood of {{congratulations}} from his fellow players on the brilliance of his stroke play. His team mates, however, had anticipated Walters' expectations and were hidden in the shower room. Ian Chappell, the Aussie skipper, {{was alone in the}} room, hunched over a newspaper crossword. Chappell looked up as Walters entered, well ahead of his fellow batsmen. 'What {{the hell are you doing}} back here? <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> not to get out tonight'...|$|E

60|$|BRODIE (same attitude). I {{spoke of}} you as I have found <b>you.</b> (<b>I</b> <b>told</b> him <b>you</b> were a disreputable hound, and that Moore had crossed a fight.) <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him <b>you</b> were a drunken ass, and Moore an incompetent and dishonest boxer.|$|R

500|$|One of Kaczynski's tactics {{was leaving}} false clues in every bomb. He would {{deliberately}} make them {{hard to find}} to mislead investigators into thinking they had a clue. The first clue was a metal plate stamped with the initials [...] "FC" [...] hidden somewhere (usually in the pipe end cap) in every bomb. One false clue he left was a note in a bomb that did not detonate which reads [...] "Wu—It works! <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> it would—RV". Another clue was the Eugene O'Neill $1 stamps used to send his boxes. One of his bombs was sent embedded in a copy of Sloan Wilson's novel Ice Brothers.|$|E

500|$|The film {{ran into}} some trouble with Joseph Breen of the Production Code Administration (the Hollywood self-censorship body), {{who opposed the}} {{suggestions}} that Captain Renault extorted sexual favors from his supplicants, and that Rick and Ilsa had slept together. Extensive changes were made, with several lines of dialogue removed or altered. All direct references to sex were deleted; Renault's selling of visas for sex, and Rick and Ilsa's previous sexual relationship were implied elliptically rather than referenced explicitly. Also, in the original script, when Sam plays [...] "As Time Goes By", Rick remarks, [...] "What the —— are you playing?" [...] This line was altered to: [...] "Sam, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> never to play..." [...] to conform to Breen's objection to an implied swear word.|$|E

And you will have war again: I know it. You used to fight the Maricopa. I want to go [...] to see the Maricopa and tell them: 'The Mohave will not come any more to attack you'." [...] Irataba, weary of the constant fighting and worried that further conflicts with neighboring tribes would draw more attention from the US soldiers, organized a peace expedition to the Maricopa, settling the ancient disputes between the two peoples.|$|E
500|$|... "My Love" [...] {{was criticized}} {{for some of the}} lyrics and sounds that were featured. Sanneh {{reported}} that Timberlake [...] "exhales his clumsy pickup lines" [...] with the lyrics [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> you were beautiful / Would you date me on the regular?". Murphy contemplated that the song is [...] "ultimately ruined" [...] by a [...] "bizarre Crazy Frog-meets-Laughing-Policeman underlay". Emily Vaughan of North by Northwestern commented that Timberlake claims to have gone around the world twice in [...] "My Love" [...] and [...] "Damn Girl" [...] and that he is also [...] "running out of creative ways to say he would like you {{to go to bed with}} him". Vaughan, however, was positive towards [...] "My Love", stating that the song, along with [...] "What Goes Around.../...Comes Around", sounded considerably different from the rest of the album.|$|E
