On 23 July 2015 the Christie NHS Foundation Trust based in Manchester issued a Prior <b>Indicative</b> <b>Notice</b> {{regarding}} an intention to procure [...] "a patient information/entertainment platform delivering patient tailored content over wireless infrastructure to mobile devices within the Trust" [...] and stated that the Trust [...] "intends to use the Innovation Partnership procedure for any subsequent procurement process" [...] and wishes [...] "to enter a long-term partnership with an organisation {{to develop a new}} patient focused extensible information/entertainment platform.". Worcestershire County Council issued a Prior <b>Indicative</b> <b>Notice</b> on 16 December 2015 seeking to appoint up to five businesses interested in [...] "developing, testing and bringing to the market innovative technology in care solutions".|$|E
5000|$|A {{competitive}} procedure {{allowing for}} negotiation with companies before finalisation of their tenders was introduced through Article 29 of the 2014 Directive (Regulation 29 in the UK Regulations). Contracting authorities using this procedure {{are required to}} provide to the market a description of their needs, {{the characteristics of the}} goods, works or services to be procured, and the award criteria which will ultimately be used to determine which business is to be awarded the contract to supply. Companies are invited through a contract notice or prior <b>indicative</b> <b>notice</b> to express interest in being invited to tender, and selected companies are then invited to submit an initial tender. Negotiations may take place between the contracting authority and each business in order to [...] "improve the content" [...] of each tender, before invitations are issued to submit a final tender. Final tenders are then evaluated against the previously published award criteria and a contract awarded.|$|E

40|$|The {{kinetics}} and equilibrium of {{the solid}} state reaction between barium carbonate and cupric oxide have been examined thermogravimetrically. The reaction rate {{is found to be}} dominated by effects of nucleation and diffusion of carbon dioxide produced. A mathematical model incorporating these effects, along with considerations of heat transfer, is found to satisfactorily correlate the conversion-time data. The reaction is found to follow the stoichiometry BaCO 3 + CuO half arrow right over half arrow left BaCuO 2 + CO 2 although at temperatures above 1123 K, some evidence of BaO is also seen through X-ray diffraction. In the pelletized samples, incomplete conversion is <b>noticed</b> <b>indicative</b> of pore closure effects leading to transport limitations. The latter is also independently confirmed by porosity and surface area measurements. Data on the reaction equilibrium are also obtained and, in conjunction with Van 2 ̆ 7 t Hoff 2 ̆ 7 s relation, are used to obtain a correlation for the endothermic heat of reaction as a function of temperature...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our research}} into the processes that govern driver attention and behavior in familiar, well-practiced situations. The experiment {{examined the effects of}} extended practice on inattention blindness and detection of changes to the driving environment in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Participants were paid to drive a simulated road regularly over 3 months of testing. A range of measures, including detection task performance and driving performance, were collected over the course of 20 sessions. Performance from a yoked Control Group who experienced the same road scenarios in a single session was also measured. The data showed changes in what drivers reported <b>noticing</b> <b>indicative</b> of inattention blindness, and declining ratings of mental demand suggesting that many participants were “driving without awareness”. Extended practice also resulted in increased sensitivity for detecting changes to road features associated with vehicle guidance and improved performance on an embedded vehicle detection task (detection of a specific vehicle type). The data provide new light on a “tandem model” of driver behavior that includes both explicit and implicit processes involved in driving performance. The findings also suggest reasons drivers are most likely to crash at locations very near their homes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our research}} {{into the nature of}} everyday driving, with a particular emphasis on the processes that govern driver behaviour in familiar, well - practiced situations. The research examined the development and maintenance of proceduralised driving habits in a high-fidelity driving simulator by paying 29 participants to drive a simulated road regularly over three months of testing. A range of measures, including detection task performance and driving performance were collected over the course of 20 sessions. Performance from a yoked control group who experienced the same road scenarios in a single session was also measured. The data showed the development of stereotyped driving patterns and changes in what drivers <b>noticed,</b> <b>indicative</b> of in attentional blindness and “driving without awareness”. Extended practice also resulted in increased sensitivity for detecting changes to foveal road features associated with vehicle guidance and performance on an embedded vehicle detection task (detection of a specific vehicle type). The changes in attentional focus and driving performance resulting from extended practice help explain why drivers are at increased risk of crashing on roads they know well. Identifying the features of familiar roads that attract driver attention, even when they are driving without awareness, can inform new interventions and designs for safer roads. The data also provide new light on a range of previous driver behaviour research including a “Tandem Model” that includes both explicit and implicit processes involved in driving performance...|$|R
