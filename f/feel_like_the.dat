5|$|Random dungeons {{were created}} for each {{floor of the}} dungeon by {{selecting}} ten to twenty rooms from a pre-built library of 200 layouts, adding in the monsters, items, and other features, and then including fixed rooms that would be found on each floor, such as a boss room and treasure room. In expanding the gameplay, McMillen used the structure of Zeldas dungeons to design how the player would progress through the game. In a typical Zelda dungeon, according to McMillen, the player acquires a new item that helps them to progress farther in the game; he took the same inspiration to assure that each level in Isaac included at least one item and one bonus item on defeating the boss that would boost the character's attributes. McMillen also wanted to encourage players to experiment to learn how things work within Isaac, mirroring how Miyamoto had done with the original Zelda game. He designed the level progression to become more difficult with the player's progression in the game, as well as additional content that became available after beating the game as to make it <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> game was long. McMillen designed four of the selectable characters based on the main classes of Dungeons & Dragons—fighter, thief, cleric and wizard.|$|E
25|$|Some {{changes made}} to Internet search engines {{included}} that of Google's search engine. Beginning in 2009, Google {{began to run}} a new system where the Google search became personalized. The item that is searched and the results that are shown remembers previous information that pertains to the individual. Google search engine not only seeks what is searched, but also strives to allow the user to <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> search engine recognizes their interests. This is achieved by using online advertising. A system that Google uses to filter advertisements and search results that might interest the user is by having a ranking system that tests relevancy that include observation of the behavior users exude while searching on Google. Another function of search engines is the predictability of location. Search engines are able to predict where one's location is currently by locating IP Addresses and geographical locations.|$|E

500|$|Jaded {{with their}} lifestyles in California {{and the various}} people frequenting the studios, the group moved the {{sessions}} to Caribbean Sound Basin in Maraval, a suburb of Port of Spain, Trinidad. The studio complex was one of Trinidad's few high-end recording locations and was founded in 1990 by Trinidadian businessman Robert Amar, who wanted to attract both local and international recording artists with a state-of-the-art facility and the area's culture. The group intended to use to the studio only to polish their previous sessions' output, but ended up writing and recording what became most of the album for two months.

500|$|Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly said he {{believed}} although the show initially needed improvement, that it had arrived at a [...] "settled and focused" [...] series with [...] "The Banquet".

Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said [...] "The Banquet" [...] was funnier than other recent Parks and Recreation episodes, although he said the Leslie character continues to too closely resemble a female Michael Scott, the protagonist of The Office. Sepinwall said of the show, [...] "I {{know a lot of people}} have already given up, but I really <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> show is a summer's worth of tweaking away from being good.

Screenwriter and director Kevin Smith praised the [...] "seat-of-your-pants" [...] season finale, writing that it managed to [...] "thread the needle with the Lilly Kane murder so well, it never feels marginalized or played out over 22 episodes". Smith compared the year-long murder mystery to that of Twin Peaks, stating that [...] "unlike Peaks, when the murderer is revealed and the storyline wrapped up in the final , it doesn't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> show's outlived its relevance; thanks to the crisp writing, the deft fleshing-out of the Mars universe and the endearing cast, you’re left wanting Veronica's story to continue." ...|$|E
