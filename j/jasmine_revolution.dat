Plainclothes policemen are often deployed during demonstrations to suppress violence. Censorship is often maintained as a measure to maintain political stability in China. Web activists can be charged by the police for using false identities to surf the Internet.

The show, co-curated by her partner, focused {{on questions of}} Tunisian identity following the 2010 <b>Jasmine</b> <b>Revolution.</b> The artist's 2012 commentary work, Smell, displayed the Shahada Muslim declaration of faith in jasmine atop a black flag, symbols of Islamic extremism and Tunisia, respectively. The flowers would decay {{against the background of}} the flag. The same year, after meeting many survivors of domestic violence during her 2012 residency in the London Delfina Foundation, Kaabi-Linke wanted to publicize the prevalence of the often marginalized crime. She created a work, Impunities London Originals, in 2012 using prints of scars from domestic violence, depicted in black powder smudges on paper.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} first {{presented}} at the "First Global Conference on Letters and Letter Writing," in Prague, Czech Republic, March 18 - 20, 2004. The change from the feudal period to modern times via the Meiji Restoration (1868) was the most turbulent and complex {{in the history of}} Japan, and many details of the change remain unexplained. This paper will shed new light on this social change by bringing attention to the seemingly sudden appearance of boku, a male first person pronoun, 1 in the emerging culture of letter writing. It was after a century of civil wars ended in 1600 and a centralized feudalism was established that samurai members and richer commoners learned writing. Letter writing became a social phenomenon of the time. It {{played an important role in}} disseminating information and awakening Japanese intellectuals to what was happening outside the country. In fear of western military power, a growing trend towards the anti- Shogun movement led to an extremely radical change in the social structure from a strictly hierarchized feudalism to a modern democracy. In the process of such fundamental social change, language inevitably played a crucial role in forming and accommodating new meanings and new ideologies. All the samurai self- referencing words that had previously been borrowed from Chinese were strongly associated with various power relationships between communicants, and they were extremely incongruent with the self of the new breed of samurai intellectuals. Samurai intellectuals adopted boku, a Chinese word with a nuance of solidarity, in the letters exchanged in the movement. Letter writing was a crucial tool for networking among anti-Shogun activists, just like the <b>Jasmine</b> <b>Revolutions</b> calling for pro-democracy online in China and other places today...|$|R

2500|$|The Ben Ali regime {{came to an}} end {{following}} nationwide demonstrations {{precipitated by}} high unemployment, food inflation, corruption, a lack of political freedoms like freedom of speech and poor living conditions. The protests constituted the most dramatic wave of social and political unrest in Tunisia in three decades and resulted in scores of deaths and injuries, most of which were the result of action by police and security forces against demonstrators. The protests were sparked by the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi on 17 December 2010 and led to the ousting of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 28 days later on 14 January 2011, when he officially resigned after fleeing to Saudi Arabia, ending 23 years in power.

5000|$|Hamada Ben Amor, {{known as}} El General, is a Tunisian rapper. El General’s {{popularity}} is largely attributable to his musical {{contributions to the}} <b>Jasmine</b> <b>Revolution</b> {{that took place in}} his home country. El General began producing hip-hop music prior to the revolution and largely relied upon social media to publicize his music. His first recording, [...] "Rais LeBled," [...] was posted to YouTube in November 2010. The song was an attack on the former authoritarian ruler, Zine El Abidine Ben-Ali, and the poor conditions in the state, including poverty, unemployment, and political and social injustices. Following the suicide attempt by Mohammed Bouazizzi in Sidi Bouzzid, Tunisia, which prompted the revolutionary movement, El General’s music was used in ensuing demonstrations. El General released subsequent songs, which similarly criticize the government and called for the end to Ben-Ali’s regime. Consequently, he was arrested and imprisoned by Tunisian state police. His imprisonment further propelled the popularity of his music and activists demanded his release. El General was released soon after Ben-Ali fled the country in January 2011. El General is widely considered {{to be one of the}} largest musical influences emerging from the Arab Spring and is considered to have made direct contributions to political activism during the <b>Jasmine</b> <b>Revolution</b> in Tunisia.|$|E

In a January 2011 article for Foreign Policy, commentator Ethan Zuckerman gave social networking technology some credit, but argued that the sustained nature of the revolts, as well as the solidarity shown between the revolts of different nations, is a phenomenon beyond the scope of online networked advocacy.|$|E
