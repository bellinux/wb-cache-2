40|$|An {{electrostatic}} actuator driven by conventional voltage control and charge control requires high actuation voltage and {{suffers from the}} pull-in phenomenon that limits its operation range, much less than its entire gap. To provide effective solutions to these problems, we present complete analytical and numerical models of various {{electrostatic actuator}}s coupled with resonant <b>drive</b> <b>circuits</b> {{that are able to}} drive electrostatic actuators at much lower input voltage than that of conventional actuation methods and to extend their operation range beyond their conventional pull-in points in the presence of high parasitic capacitance. Moreover, in order to validate the analytical and numerical models of various electrostatic actuators coupled with the resonant <b>drive</b> <b>circuits,</b> we perform the experiment on the microplate and the micromirror coupled with the resonant <b>drive</b> <b>circuit.</b> For instance, using a high voltage amplifier, we manage to rotate the micromirror with sidewall electrodes by 6 ° at 180 V. However, using the resonant <b>drive</b> <b>circuit,</b> we are able to rotate the same micromirror by 6 ° at much lower input voltage, 8. 5 V. In addition, the presented work also facilitates the stability analysis of electrostatic actuators coupled with the resonant <b>drive</b> <b>circuits</b> and provides how the effect of the parasitic capacitance can be minimized. For example, the resonant <b>drive</b> <b>circuit</b> placed within a positive feedback loop of a variable gain amplifier is able to extend the operation range much further even in the presence of very high parasitic capacitance. The resonant <b>drive</b> <b>circuit</b> with the proposed feedback controllers is also able to minimize the detrimental effects of the parasitic capacitance and to displace a parallel-plate actuator over its entire gap without the saddle-node bifurcation. Finally, we present a new displacement measurement method of electrostatic actuators coupled with the resonant <b>drive</b> <b>circuits</b> by sensing the phase delay of an actuation voltage with respect to an input voltage. This new measurement method allows us to easily implement feedback control into existent systems employing an electrostatic actuator without any modification or alteration to the electrostatic actuator itself.
