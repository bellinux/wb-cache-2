5|$|Although {{he claimed}} he was {{reluctant}} to enter politics, Hugh Mason became the first Liberal elected councillor for Ashton-under-Lyne in November 1856. He represented the Portland Place ward from 1856 until his retirement from politics in 1874. Mason quickly made an impression and was elected mayor for three consecutive years between 1857 and 1860, which <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> before. He supported progressive measures such as opening a public park, providing public libraries, and addressing unsanitary conditions in parts of Ashton-under-Lyne.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Nolte {{hinted at}} the {{possibility}} that the Holocaust <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> at all. Nolte claimed that the Wannsee Conference never took place, and argued that most Holocaust scholarship is flawed because most Holocaust historians are Jewish, and thus “biased” against Germany and in favour of the idea that there was a Holocaust.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} 1991 World Series {{was ranked}} by ESPN {{to be the}} best ever played, with four games decided on the final pitch and three games going into extra innings.

In the end, one of these children, Ellie Waters, saves Earth from the godlike Marduk entity, preventing the Apocalypse and reordering reality as if the Marduk crisis <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> (though Ellie alone apparently retains her memories of these events). The Surfer resumes his interstellar wanderings, but promises {{to be ready to}} aid his adopted homeworld should Earth ever need him.|$|E
25|$|The {{governor}} received Reeves' resignation {{from his}} ministerial posts and his electorate upon {{his arrival in}} Lyttelton on 13 January, but the following day, Scott resigned from the campaign. On 16 January, the Seddon Ministry gazetted Reeves' resignation from his ministerial posts, but not his resignation from the City of Christchurch electorate. On 23 January, Liberal Party organisers met and confirmed Richard Molesworth Taylor as the official government candidate. The following day, Reeves' resignation was finally gazetted. The writ was issued on 31 January and the election advertised by the returning officer, John Whitelaw, on 3 February. The nomination date was set for 5 February, and the election date set for Thursday, 13 February. Polling was from 9am to 7pm, and 11 polling booths were provided throughout the central city, Waltham, Phillipstown, Richmond, Sydenham, Addington, Edgeware (then called Knightstown), and St Albans. Three ministers of the crown travelled from Wellington to Christchurch to support Richard Molesworth Taylor; The Press commented that this <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> before.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, {{nineteen}} men hijacked four airliners all bound for California. Once the hijackers assumed control of the airliners, they told the passengers {{that they had a}} bomb on board and would spare the lives of passengers and crew once their demands were met – no passenger and crew actually suspected that they would use the airliners as suicide weapons since it <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> before in history, and many previous hijacking attempts had been resolved with the passengers and crew escaping unharmed after obeying the hijackers. The hijackers – members of al-Qaeda's Hamburg cell – intentionally crashed two airliners into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. Both buildings collapsed within two hours from fire damage related to the crashes, destroying nearby buildings and damaging others. The hijackers crashed a third airliner into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, just outside Washington D.C. The fourth plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of the plane, which the hijackers had redirected toward Washington D.C., to target the White House or the U.S. Capitol. None of the flights had any survivors. A total of 2,977 victims and the 19 hijackers perished in the attacks. Fifteen of the nineteen were citizens of Saudi Arabia, and the others were from the United Arab Emirates (2), Egypt, and Lebanon.|$|E

Stan Robertson at NBC suggested to Roddenberry that they might wish to get medical advice over whether the draining of a chemical from a person would kill them instantly. To find out, Roddenberry asked Kellam de Forest Research, who said that, while it <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> in reality, a quick death would be likely. Johnson suggested that the creature in [...] "The Man Trap" [...] could be the last of its species. He compared its situation to the reduction in numbers of American bison. Roddenberry found the idea intriguing.|$|E
500|$|Since its {{original}} release, The Big Lebowski {{has become a}} cult classic. Ardent fans of the film call themselves [...] "achievers". Steve Palopoli wrote about the film's emerging cult status in July 2002. He first realized that the film had a cult following when he attended a midnight screening in 2000 at the New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles and witnessed people quoting dialogue from the film to each other. Soon after the article appeared, the programmer for a local midnight film series in Santa Cruz decided to screen The Big Lebowski and on the first weekend they had to turn away several hundred people. The theater held the film over for six weeks, which <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> before.|$|E
500|$|It was {{the fifth}} one-two finish for Mercedes that season and Massa's first podium {{appearance}} since Abu Dhabi the year before. The victory moved Rosberg closer to his teammate in the Drivers' Championship, now ten points behind. It was his eleventh career victory, putting him level with Jacques Villeneuve, Rubens Barrichello and third placed Felipe Massa, who became only the eighth driver {{in the history of}} the sport to achieve more than 1,000 championship points. In the Constructors' Championship, Williams extended their lead to Red Bull to 74 points, while Force India moved up to fifth after their second double-points finish of the season. In a weekend that the official Formula One website described as [...] "a new low" [...] for McLaren, Fernando Alonso retired from the fourth consecutive race, something that <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> to him in his career.|$|E

500|$|Initially, Todd, as {{described}} by Hayward, was written as [...] "unequivocally bad: sullen, remorseless, charmless". [...] As Todd's popularity grew with the audience, mostly due to Howarth's abilities to portray Todd {{as more than a}} one-dimensional rapist, Malone and executive producer Susan Bedsow Horgan chose the controversial option of redeeming Todd rather than killing him off or permanently sending him to prison, which is what soap operas had usually done with irredeemable rapists in the past. The writers began to redeem Todd, or change him so that he could be incorporated into the show, in the spring of 1994, a year after the rape. Hayward states that it required [...] "a whole arsenal of symbolic weaponry," [...] something that <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> in soap operas before. Malone was intrigued by crafting the story in this way, and saw it as the spiritual journey of a man who wanted forgiveness for his past misdeeds.|$|E
500|$|From 1922 to 1926, Casey was {{the officer}} {{in charge of the}} Engineer Unit of the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, {{reverting}} to his substantive rank of first lieutenant on 27 November 1922. He again returned to Camp Humpreys in 1926 to attend the Company Officers Course. In 1927, Casey received his first civil works assignment, as assistant District Engineer at the Pittsburgh District. Casey took over the task of preparing a voluminous report on flood control. The Corps of Engineers was criticized by the Pittsburgh Flood Control Commission for over-engineering, in planning for a [...] "flood that <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> and never would happen", and the report was shelved. However, in 1936 the flood did happen. The report was then dusted off and its recommendations were adopted. The Flood Control Act of 1936 assigned responsibility for flood control to the Corps of Engineers and other Federal agencies. Casey was also responsible for construction at Deadman Island Lock and Dam (now called the Dashields Lock and Dam) on the Ohio River.|$|E
500|$|Muhanna {{arrived at}} the Ilkhan's court in 1316, but then {{decided to go back}} to Palmyra where he was {{contacted}} by the sultan who summoned him to his court in Cairo. Muhanna avoided meeting the sultan, and sent his brothers and sons instead. He was able to gain the sultan's forgiveness and was restored to his position in 1317. The defection and subsequent reconciliation with an-Nasir marked the first episode in Muhanna's policy of extracting maximum gain from both the Mamluks and the Ilkhanids. According to contemporary historian Abu'l Fida, who maintained good ties with the Al Fadl, Muhanna pursued a policy whereby both the Mamluks and Ilkhanids accorded him iqtaʿat, money and robes of honor while he stayed effectively neutral, [...] "not going to this party or that; a case the like of which <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> before". Moreover, Fadl too participated in this policy with Muhanna, albeit discreetly; the contemporary historian al-Umari wrote [...] "Muhanna and Fadl were agreed at heart, but openly they were otherwise".|$|E

2500|$|Rhapsody {{ranked the}} album #9 on its Rock’s Best Albums of the Decade list.

But when the music's this good, those concerns fly out the window. Jones pours everything she's got into this album, and her gruff, passionate, brassy style grabs you by the collar and doesn't let go until the end. The Dap-Kings restrain themselves behind her, shuffling and jangling but leaving her plenty of space to maneuver on a clutch of good, if not great, songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|The case {{introduced}} {{what has}} since {{become known as the}} [...] "Mt.

First, the plaintiff must prove that the activity they were allegedly disciplined for was indeed protected speech. The defendant must then show by a preponderance that the adverse action would have occurred if the protected activity <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened.</b> This has been criticized as allowing public employers a way to circumvent restrictions on taking adverse action against whistleblowers, and more generally as incompatible with the underlying principles of tort law. The test has also been expanded into mixed motive discrimination cases in employment law.|$|E
