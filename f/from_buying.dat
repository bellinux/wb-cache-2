5|$|After the {{collapse}} of Imperial Germany in November 1918, the Finns sought new political partners. The United Kingdom had been a significant trading partner since the 18th century, and the Finns worked to improve the relations {{for the next two}} decades. In the 1930s Finland purchased Thornycroft torpedo boats from the United Kingdom, and also refrained <b>from</b> <b>buying</b> bomber aircraft from Germany because of British protests, purchasing instead modern Bristol Blenheims, which later served successfully during the Winter War.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated {{with the}} legal hassles that went with land speculation, in 1788, Boone moved upriver to Point Pleasant, Virginia (now West Virginia). There he {{operated}} a trading post and occasionally worked as a surveyor's assistant. When Virginia created Kanawha County in 1789, Boone was appointed lieutenant colonel of the county militia. In 1791, {{he was elected to}} the Virginia legislature for the third time. He contracted to provide supplies for the Kanawha militia, but his debts prevented him <b>from</b> <b>buying</b> goods on credit, so he closed his store and returned to hunting and trapping.|$|E

5|$|In March 1997, Michigan and the Big Ten {{released}} {{the results of}} an investigation of Martin's relationship with the school. The investigation determined that Martin had nurtured a relationship that involved some minor violations. The violations that were published were that Martin was present at a recruit's home during a visit by head coach Fisher; and he'd given a U-M player a birthday cake. Fisher prevented Martin from committing serious additional violations by keeping him from placing a deposit on an apartment for a player. He also stopped Martin <b>from</b> <b>buying</b> airplane tickets for another player's family. A second October 1997 private investigation also failed to reveal any large violations.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the Jones Beach Parkway Authority {{raised the}} {{toll on the}} Southern State Parkway from to 25cents, while the Loop Parkway {{retained}} its 25cent toll. The change faced immediate criticism from the New York State Legislature, and the Democratic members tried to rescind the toll hike. The power Robert Moses still had in {{a deal with the}} State of New York made sure that only his authority could choose when to raise and rollback tolls. However, the deals never prohibited the state <b>from</b> <b>buying</b> out the bonds the authority had themselves and thus take over the roads maintained by the Jones Beach Parkway Authority. Governor Hugh Carey had yet to craft the $12billion state budget for 1978, and he proposed a deal to forgo the $24 million (1978USD) debt that the agency had accumulated and eliminate the toll on the Loop Parkway by taking over the roads.|$|E
5|$|In retrospect, however, critics often cite Atari's Pac-Man as a {{major factor}} in the drop of {{consumer}} confidence in the company, which contributed to the North American video game crash of 1983. Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra stated that the game's poor quality damaged the company's reputation. Buchanan commented that it disappointed millions of fans and diminished confidence in Atari's games. Former Next Generation editor-in-chief Neil West attributes his longtime skepticism of Atari's quality to the disappointment he had <b>from</b> <b>buying</b> the game as a child. Calling the game the top video game disaster, Buchanan credits Pac-Man as a factor to the downfall of Atari and the industry in the 1980s. Author Steven Kent also blames the game, along with Atari's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, for severely damaging the company's reputation and profitability. Montfort and Bogost stated that the game's negative reception seeded mistrust in retailers, which was reinforced by later factors that culminated in the crash.|$|E

5|$|While Theophilus Cibber was disputing with Highmore and Ellys, Aaron Hill became {{interested}} in partnering at the Theatre Royal. Hill was earlier a partner at the theatre until he was removed during a previous actor riot {{that took place in}} June 1710. On 22 March 1733, Hill, in a letter to Benjamin Victor, a dramatist who had arranged the sale of Booth's shares to Highmore, criticised {{the fact that he was}} kept <b>from</b> <b>buying</b> into the theatre's management and attacked Theophilus. He offered 900 pounds for three years for Booth's shares and 1800 pounds for Mary Wilks's shares. Negotiations continued until May when they were dropped. Hester Booth, widow of Barton Booth, sold her remaining shares to Henry Giffard, the manager of Goodman's Fields Theatre, just few days after her husband died on 10 May.|$|E
5|$|Abuses {{of power}} over the villagers by Abir had been {{reported}} by missionaries almost since they began operations in the Congo but the first real public disclosure came in 1901 {{with the publication of}} a report, written by an ex-agent, in several Belgian newspapers. The Free State began an investigation into Abir's abuses during which an inquiry established at Bongandanga heard evidence from missionaries in the concession. As a result, Abir took action against the missionaries, stopping the carriage of their mail on company steamers, stopping the missionaries' boats and confiscating any mail that they carried. Abir also forbid missionaries <b>from</b> <b>buying</b> food from villagers, forcing them to buy from Abir's own stores. In 1904 Roger Casement issued the Casement Report which condemned the Abir system; this resulted in the Free State launching another investigation later that year. Although evidence of unlawful killings made by Abir was uncovered the investigation had no powers of arrest and could only submit a report to the Free State authorities. This lack of action resulted in deteriorating relations between Abir and the missionaries and there was at least one attempted shooting of a missionary. Evidence for Abir's abuses also came from the governor of the French Congo, to the north-west, who claimed that prior to 1903 30,000 people had been driven from the Free State to the French Congo by Abir's actions.|$|E
