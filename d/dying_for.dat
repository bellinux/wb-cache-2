5|$|The admirals, however, were {{reckoning}} {{without their}} sailors. The enlisted {{men of the}} High Seas Fleet, aware that Germany had lost the war, {{had no interest in}} <b>dying</b> <b>for</b> the sake of the Navy's honor. When the details of Plan 19 were leaked to the fleet, a mutiny almost instantly broke out, with sailors raising the red flag of revolution and refusing to obey their officers. Faced with a complete breakdown of discipline within his fleet, Admiral Hipper {{had no choice but to}} disperse his ships to their homeports in early November. Days later, on 11 November 1918, World War I came to an end.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Duncan MacDougall, a {{physician}} from Haverhill, Massachusetts, {{who wished to}} scientifically determine if a soul had weight, identified six patients in nursing homes whose death was imminent. Four were suffering from tuberculosis, one from diabetes, and one from unspecified causes. MacDougall specifically chose people who were suffering from conditions that caused physical exhaustion, as he needed the patients to remain still when they died to measure them accurately. When the patients {{looked like they were}} close to death, their entire bed was placed on an industrial sized scale that was sensitive within two tenths of an ounce (5.6 grams). On the belief that humans have souls and that animals do not, MacDougall later measured the changes in weight from fifteen dogs after death. MacDougall said he wished to use dogs that were sick or <b>dying</b> <b>for</b> his experiment, though was unable to find any. It is therefore presumed he poisoned healthy dogs.|$|E
2500|$|Ending {{his closing}} arguments, Prosecutor Barnes invoked {{the image of}} a dead soldier in France, stating, “He lies dead, and he <b>died</b> <b>for</b> you and he <b>died</b> <b>for</b> me. He <b>died</b> <b>for</b> Max Eastman. He <b>died</b> <b>for</b> John Reed. He <b>died</b> <b>for</b> Merrill Rogers. His voice is but one of a {{thousand}} silent voices that demand that these men be punished.” Art Young, who had taken to sleeping through most of the court proceedings, awoke at the end of Barnes’s argument, whispering loudly, “What? Didn’t he <b>die</b> <b>for</b> me?” John Reed, sitting next to Young responded, “Cheer up Art, Jesus <b>died</b> <b>for</b> you." [...] As before, the jury returned unable to come to a unanimous decision (though without threats of violence).|$|R

5|$|When {{a colony}} is <b>dying,</b> <b>for</b> {{whatever}} cause, and other healthy colonies are nearby (as is typical in a bee yard), those healthy colonies often enter the dying colony and rob its provisions {{for their own}} use. If the dying colony's provisions were contaminated (by natural or man-made toxins), the resulting pattern (of healthy colonies becoming sick when in proximity to a dying colony) might suggest to an observer that a contagious disease is involved. However, it is typical in CCD cases that provisions of dying colonies are not being robbed, suggesting that at least this particular mechanism (toxins being spread via robbing, thereby mimicking a disease) {{is not involved in}} CCD. Additional evidence that CCD is an infectious disease came from the following observations: the hives of colonies that had died from CCD could be reused with a healthy colony only if they were first treated with DNA-destroying radiation, and the CCD Working Group report in 2010 indicated that CCD-exhibiting hives tended to occur in proximity to one another within apiaries.|$|E
25|$|Before his execution, Rizal wrote a {{proclamation}} {{denouncing the}} revolution.

25|$|The {{followers}} of the young Imam Hadi who joined the military were trained as the Fidai. The Fidai's bravery and self-sacrificing spirituality was due to their belief that the Nizari Imam-ul-waqt ("Imam of the time") had the Noor (light) of God within him. As such it became a religious duty for the Fidai to obey every dictate of their Imam-ul-waqt and to protect him and their community of believers without compromise even {{to the extent of}} <b>dying</b> <b>for</b> their cause.|$|E
25|$|However, Richelieu was now <b>dying.</b> <b>For</b> {{many years}} he had {{suffered}} from recurrent fevers (possibly malaria), strangury, intestinal tuberculosis with fistula, and migraine. Now his right arm was suppurating with tubercular osteitis, and he coughed blood (after his death, his lungs {{were found to have}} extensive cavities and caseous necrosis). His doctors continued to bleed him frequently, further weakening him. As he felt his death approaching, he named Mazarin, one of his most faithful followers, to succeed him as chief minister to the King.|$|E

5000|$|Young's {{propensity}} for napping worked to the defendant's advantage during the closing arguments. Prosecutor Barnes, wrapped in an American flag and giving a moving speech, {{told a story}} of a dead soldier in France. This soldier, Barnes claimed, [...] "is but one of a thousand whose voices are not silent. He <b>died</b> <b>for</b> you and he <b>died</b> <b>for</b> me. He <b>died</b> <b>for</b> Max Eastman. He <b>died</b> <b>for</b> John Reed. He <b>died</b> <b>for</b> Merrill Rogers. He demands that these men be punished." [...] Roused from his slumber by the impassioned speech, Young exclaimed, [...] "What! Didn't he <b>die</b> <b>for</b> me too?" [...] The beautiful oration successfully ruined, the second jury was unable to convict or acquit. Eight jurors voted for acquittal and four for conviction. It would be the last time Young appeared in court for the charges, as they were dropped after failing twice to garner any convictions.|$|R

25|$|After quelling much public discontent, Starways Congress {{finishes}} {{their analysis}} of the situation while the fleet is en route. Fearing the Descolada virus, further rebellions by colony worlds, and other possible unknown political motives, Starways Congress attempts to relay an order to the fleet to annihilate Lusitania upon arrival. After conferring with friends on whether a cause is worth <b>dying</b> <b>for,</b> Jane (a compassionate AI living in the interstellar ansible communication network) shuts off transmissions to the fleet to block the order. As a consequence of this action, she risks her eventual discovery and death, should the government shut down and wipe the interplanetary network.

25|$|The {{potency of}} the {{personal}} self and relational ties distinguish identity fusion from other forms of alignment with groups, such as “group identification”. In group identification, allegiance to the collective eclipses the personal self and relational ties to other group members. Because of this, the personal self and relational ties are not as involved in theories of group identification. Identity fusion theorizes that fusion measures should be more predictive of extreme pro-group behavior than previously proposed measures of identification. In fact, there is growing evidence of this. Measures of identity fusion are particularly powerful predictors of personally costly pro-group behaviors, including endorsement of extreme behaviors, such as fighting and <b>dying</b> <b>for</b> the group.|$|E

25|$|After {{years of}} making the same {{migration}} {{from north to south}} and vice versa, an adult Scowler becomes the herd's new leader, and chooses Juniper to be his mate, much to Patchi's disappointment. Scowler recklessly leads the herd onto a thinly frozen pond, and Patchi is able to lead the majority of the herd to safety. Enraged and believing Patchi to be usurping him and also trying to take Juniper from him, Scowler goads Patchi into a battle for leadership of the herd. Scowler quickly wins and disowns Patchi, ordering Juniper {{and the rest of the}} herd to leave him behind. Despondent and heartbroken, Patchi tries to allow predators to eat him, but Alex convinces him to die for something worth <b>dying</b> <b>for</b> as Bulldust did.|$|E
25|$|Since its foundation, {{the socialist}} party has opposed every war – {{including}} both World War I and World War II. Although, in its early years, party writers frequently would contrast the numbers of dead in wars with the numbers killed and maimed in industrial incidents (by {{way of trying to}} contrast the passions and efforts put into war with the lack of response to the conditions of capitalism) the party argued that wars in capitalism were fought {{in the interests of the}} capitalist class and – as with their case against nationalism – the workers did all the <b>dying</b> <b>for</b> no gain for themselves. Further, they emphasised that while the press and politicians tried to call for strike moderation, the capitalists would continue the class war despite hostilities, forcing down wages and up consumer good prices. During both wars, some members won Conscientious objector status.|$|E
25|$|The first track, «Babilla» (Puerto Rican jargon for Courage), {{serves as}} the album's intro, and its concept {{is similar to the}} one in his {{previous}} studio album, Desahogo, being a relief to all that annoys him, mentioning Donald Trump's xenophobia, sexual video games, religion and people who want to take advantage with his music. «Sentimiento» (Spanish for Feeling) talks about a beautiful and attractive woman who wants a sincere romantic relationship and getting married instead of money and luxury. «Se Escapa» (Spanish for She Escapes) is about respecting and taking care of one's girlfriend in order to not lose her. «Moriré» (Spanish for I Will Die) is a romantic ballad about <b>dying</b> <b>for</b> a woman if she is no longer interesed in one's feelings after a long relationship, using a lot of analogies centered in animals and nature. «El Silencio Mata» (Spanish for Silence Kills) talks about a woman who suffers of domestic violence but needs to talk to someone about that, although she's too scared to denounce his own spouse. «El Corazón Se Pone Bruto» (Spanish for The Heart Gets Stupid) is a moralizing reggaeton about thinking before acting and encouraging the use of preservative, telling two stories about girls that are attracted to men they recently know, both with terrible endings (one girl ends pregnant and the other contracting AIDS). «La Prueba de Farmacia» (Spanish for Pharmacy Test) tells the story about a pregnant teenager who tries to convince her mother that her boyfriend will take care of her whatever happens. «Angelina» tells the story about a low class single mother who have to work as a stripper in order to earn enough money to feed her baby after being abandoned by her boyfriend. «Agua» is about Vico's detention in late 2002 because of porting heroin in his car, complaining about the police and Puerto Rican justice. The term agua (literally water in Spanish) is used in the song as a Puerto Rican jargon referring to the police.|$|E
