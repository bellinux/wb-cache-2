40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{presence}} of human faecal contamination in surface water catchments {{is one of}} the greatest concerns to water managers as it poses potential public health and environmental risks to consumers and users of water. This study was conducted to evaluate the potential effectiveness of the use of fluorescent whitening compounds (FWCs) measured with simple <b>fluorometers</b> to track human sourced contamination in water. The sole {{presence of}} faecal indicator bacteria in water does not provide sufficient information regarding the possible sources of faecal contamination. While traditional faecal indicator bacteria have been used for a variety of reasons, other techniques can assist in determining whether the contamination in surface water is likely to have been derived from human or other animal sources. Identifying whether the contamination is from a human source is important from a public health perspective as there are a number of significant water borne human diseases which may contaminate particularly aquaculture products which are grown in estuaries and may be consumed by humans. Methods developed for human sourced contamination tracking in water include chemical markers of anthropogenic origin such as FWCs, caffeine and pharmaceutical compounds. Like many other molecular markers, FWCs, which are derived from laundry and toilet cleaning detergents, can enter surface water environment from failing on-site wastewater management systems (OWMS) or through licensed discharge from wastewater treatment plants. FWCs are virtually ubiquitous in human sewage and therefore indicative of human sourced contamination to surface water. The FWC molecules are fairly structurally stable with slow rates of environmental degradation. FWCs can be detected using thin layer chromatography (TLC), ultraviolet (UV) light, mass spectrometry (MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and spectrofluorometers. They may readily be detected at fairly low concentrations using fluorometry. However, systems like mass spectrometry, HPLC and spectrofluorometers are complicated and need personnel to have advanced training to operate this instrumentation where available, and analysis times may also be slow. The use of cheap, simple monitoring equipment such as fixed wavelength <b>fluorometers</b> can offer simplicity and have shorter turnaround time for sample analysis if used. However, in previous studies, the use of simple <b>fluorometers</b> has been impaired by the potential impacts of background matrix interferences from other fluorescing compounds which may cause spectral interferences, inner filtering and concentration quenching effects during fluorescence measurements. In this study, which entailed laboratory and field studies, two simple <b>fluorometers</b> were optimised in the laboratory and validated against the usual sophisticated methods used for FWC analysis including HPLC and a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer. The validated detecting method for FWCs using simple <b>fluorometers</b> was applied to field samples from two case studies in NSW to track human sourced water contamination in conjunction with other established faecal source tracking methods. In this research, the results of optimization have shown that the above stated problems for simple <b>fluorometers</b> can be overcome, and when the optimised simple <b>fluorometers</b> were validated against the usual equipment used like the Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer, the results were found to be not significantly different (p> 0. 05). When the results were confirmed with additional HPLC analysis, the correlation coefficient, r² = 0. 8247 (Pearson’s correlation) and student t-test, indicated that the results were not significantly different to those obtained using the simple <b>fluorometers.</b> The FWCs detection method using simple <b>fluorometers</b> was applied to environmental samples from various water sources giving FWC concentrations similar to those obtained by other researchers who used more sophisticated analysis methods. The FWC method was also applied to samples from two field studies in New South Wales, in conjunction with other faecal source tracking tools which included faecal sterol analysis, dye tracing and bacterial indicator organisms. Simple <b>fluorometers</b> proved that they can be used along with other tools to track human sourced contamination in surface water. It is, therefore, possible to measure FWCs using simple <b>fluorometers</b> to source track human contamination. The use of simple <b>fluorometers</b> to indicate the presence of human sourced contamination can reduce the cost of water testing and reduce the turnaround times for the samples tested. They can be used by personnel in rural and remote areas where it is not possible to access more sophisticated instrumental methods for fluorescence analysis. However, future studies still need to be conducted across a broader geographic area both in developed/developing countries and urban/rural areas to discover the limitations of working with simple <b>fluorometers</b> and the minimum thresholds for their use. This needs to be done to identify fluorometric “hotspots” of human sourced contamination and to also build up a database of FWCs concentrations in various environmental conditions...|$|R

The purpose of the workshop was to explore recent trends in fluorometry {{as it relates to}} resource management applications in nearshore environments. Participants included representatives from state and federal environmental management agencies as well as research institutions, many of whom are currently using this technology in their research and management applications. Manufacturers and developers of fluorometric measuring systems also attended the meeting. The Workshop attendees discussed the historical and present uses of fluorometry technology and identified the great potential for its use by coastal managers to fulfill their regulatory and management objectives. Participants also identified some of the challenges associated with the correct use of <b>Fluorometers</b> to estimate biomass and the rate of primary productivity. The Workshop concluded that in order to expand the existing use of <b>fluorometers</b> in both academic and resource management disciplines, several issues concerning data collection, instrument calibration, and data interpretation needed to be addressed. Participants identified twelve recommendations, the top five of which are listed below: Recommendations 1) Develop a "Guide" that describes the most important aspects of fluorescence measurements. This guide should be written by an expert party, with both research and industry input, and should be distributed by all manufacturers with their instrumentation. The guide should also be made available on the ACT website {{as well as those of}} other relevant organizations. The guide should include discussions on the following topics: The benefits of using <b>fluorometers</b> in research and resource management applications; What <b>fluorometers</b> can and cannot provide in terms of measurements; The necessary assumptions required before applying fluorometry; Characterization and calibration of fluorometers; (pdf contains 32 pages...|$|R

50|$|Chlorophyll {{fluorescence}} {{emitted from}} plant leaves, gives {{an insight into}} {{the health of the}} photosynthetic systems within the leaf. Chlorophyll <b>fluorometers</b> are designed to measure variable fluorescence of photosystem II. This variable fluorescence can be used to measure the level of plant stress. The most commonly used protocols include those aimed at measuring the photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II, both in the light (ΔF/Fm’) and in a dark-adapted state (Fv/Fm).Chlorophyll <b>fluorometers</b> are, for the most part, less expensive tools than photosynthesis systems, they also have a faster measurement time and tend to be more portable. For these reasons they have {{become one of the most}} important tools for field measurements of plant stress.|$|R

50|$|At a {{specific}} {{amount of the}} dye, the amount of fluorescence signal from this mixture is directly proportional to the concentration of DNA in the solution. The Qubit <b>fluorometer</b> can pick up this fluorescence signal and convert it into a DNA concentration measurement using DNA standards of known concentration. The Qubit <b>fluorometer</b> uses DNA standards to derive the relationship between DNA concentration and fluorescence. It then uses this relationship to calculate the concentration of a sample, based on its fluorescence when mixed with the Qubit dye.|$|E
50|$|An {{integrated}} <b>fluorometer</b> is {{a system}} that measures the light reaction and the dark reaction of photosynthesis. Software allows combined operation of gas exchange measurement and chlorophyll fluorescence measurement of a leaf. These parameters are used to non-destructively measure the photosynthetic efficiency of plants. The use of an integrated chlorophyll <b>fluorometer</b> provides the opportunity to measure additional measuring parameters that allow for a more exact measurement of photosynthesis than with gas exchange alone. Advanced gas exchange instrumentation, by itself, is capable of measuring A/Ci curves, commonly used for plant characterization. “A” is the term for photosynthetic rate (rate of CO2 exchange in the leaf chamber), and Ci is Sub-stomatal CO2 concentration or intracellular CO2 level within the leaf. When measured over a range of CO2 levels above and below ambient conditions, A/Ci curves become possible. With the addition of an integrated chlorophyll <b>fluorometer,</b> it becomes possible to measure more accurate A/CC curves, or photosynthetic rate at the site of carboxylation in chloroplasts. The integrated <b>fluorometer</b> allows measurement of mesophyll conductance, or the opposite of the resistance to CO2 transfer from intracellular air spaces to the site of carboxylation in chloroplasts. Various integrated chlorophyll <b>fluorometer</b> measuring protocols, such as the Laisk Protocol, the Kok protocol and the Yin Protocol are used to measure or estimate gm or mesophyll conductance. For example: the Laisk protocol allows the measurement of Γ* or compensation point, and Rd or respiration in the dark. Both values are required to calculate gm or mesophyll conductance and CC or CO2 at the site of carboxylation. Parameters typically measured by the gas exchange portion of the system include: “A” or photosynthetic rate, “gs” or stomatal conductance, “Ci” or sub stomatal CO2 concentration, and “E” or transpiration.|$|E
50|$|Crop {{consultants}} {{also use}} these tools for fertilizer recommendations. However, because strict scientific protocols are more time consuming and more expensive, consultants sometimes use well-fertilized plants located in low-lying areas {{as the standard}} well-fertilized plants. They typically also use fewer measurements. The evidence for this approach involves anecdotal discussions with crop consultants.Chlorophyll content meters are sensitive to both nitrogen and sulfur stress at usable levels. Chlorophyll <b>fluorometers</b> require a special assay, involving a high actinic light level in combination with nitrogen stress, to measure nitrogen stress at usable levels. In addition, chlorophyll <b>fluorometers</b> will only detect sulfur stress at starvation levels. For best results, chlorophyll content measurements should be made when water deficits are not present. Photosynthesis systems will detect both nitrogen and sulfur stress.|$|R
