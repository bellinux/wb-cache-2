25|$|A {{professor}} of American history at Harvard University {{specializing in the}} history of gender and sexuality has researched gender roles and marriage trends for decades. Dr. Cott has testified for the plaintiffs in both United States v. Windsor and Hollingsworth v. Perry. Cott offered several examples of discriminatory practices involving marriages over the years which are no longer accepted, among them interracial marriages once being banned, American women who married foreigners once lost their citizenship and property, and the U.S. government at times not acknowledging Native American and Japanese marriages. Cott testified on February 28, 2014 that “The trend <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> same-sex gender neutrality/gender equality marriages; and the trend <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> same-sex marriages.” She also testified that “The Michigan Marriage Amendment obstructs that trend from continuing.” In explaining how marriage has evolved, Cott cited the 300-year ban on interracial marriage, which was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia in 1967. Cott said marriage is a “civil contract” that only be legally sanctioned by legislatures and the courts. In addressing religious objections to same-sex marriage, she said religious authorities have no legal standing over marriages even though they are allowed to conduct marriage ceremonies. Cott testified that there have been no laws in U.S. history that made procreation a requirement for marriage, an argument used by opponents of same-sex marriage. Under cross-examination by state attorney Michelle Brya, Cott admitted the state of Michigan does have an interest in marriage {{between a man and a}} woman for population purposes and sometimes economic reasons but did not believe those two issues should stand in the way of same-sex couples legally marrying.|$|E

500|$|The radial {{velocity}} {{of a star}} is its motion toward or away from the Sun. Unlike proper motion, a star's {{radial velocity}} cannot be directly observed, but must be determined through measurement of the spectrum. Due to the Doppler shift, the absorption lines in the spectrum of a star will be shifted slightly toward the red (or longer wavelengths) if the star is {{moving away from the}} observer, or toward blue (or shorter wavelengths) when it moves toward the observer. In the case of Tau Ceti, the radial velocity is about −17km/s, with the negative value indicating that it <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> the Sun. The star will make its closest approach to the Sun in about 43,000years when it comes to within [...]|$|E

2500|$|The Doppler {{effect for}} {{electromagnetic}} waves such as light {{is of great}} use in astronomy and results in either a so-called redshift or blueshift. It {{has been used to}} measure the speed at which stars and galaxies are approaching or receding from us; that is, their radial velocities. This may be used to detect if an apparently single star is, in reality, a close binary, to measure the rotational speed of stars and galaxies, or to detect exoplanets. (Note that redshift is also used to measure the expansion of space, but that this is not truly a Doppler effect.) This redshift and blueshift happens on a very small scale, if an object <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> earth, there would not be a noticeable difference in visible light [...]|$|E
2500|$|An {{interesting}} {{effect was}} predicted by Lord Rayleigh {{in his classic}} book on sound: if the source <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> the observer at twice the speed of sound, a musical piece emitted by that source would be heard in correct time and tune, but backwards. The Doppler effect with sound is only clearly heard with objects moving at high speed, as change in frequency of musical tone involves a speed of around 40 meters per second, and smaller changes in frequency can easily be confused by changes in the amplitude of the sounds from moving emitters. [...] Neil A Downie has demonstrated [...] how the Doppler effect can be made much more easily audible by using an ultrasonic (e.g. 40kHz) emitter on the moving object. The observer then uses a heterodyne frequency converter, as used in many bat detectors, {{to listen to a}} band around 40kHz. In this case, with the bat detector tuned to give frequency for the stationary emitter of 2000Hz, the observer will perceive a frequency shift of a whole tone, 240Hz, if the emitter travels at 2 meters per second.|$|E
