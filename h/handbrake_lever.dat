5|$|In 2004, {{just two}} years before the release of the VE Commodore, Holden {{unveiled}} the Torana TT36 concept car at the Australian International Motor Show in Sydney. The TT36 served as a preview of the VE and allowed Holden to gauge public reaction to its styling. Much of the Torana's styling drew on the essence of the VE's design. Some production-ready components even carried over from the TT36 including the steering wheel, the window and rear-view mirror switch cluster and the <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|E
25|$|The KR175 {{used the}} {{standard}} Kabinenroller steering system, with a steering bar connected {{directly to the}} track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small, measured inputs. The KR175's steering bar was made from tubular steel. The gearshift lever, {{on the right side}} of the cockpit, had a secondary lever on it which operated the clutch. The throttle was operated by a twist-grip on the left handlebar. The foot brake pedal, which was the only pedal in the car, operated brakes on all three wheels mechanically, using cables. The <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever</b> operated similarly.|$|E
2500|$|The 303 was {{the first}} German car in its size and price class to have {{automatic}} [...] "one-shot" [...] chassis lubrication. Each wheel had a drum brake; all four were operated through the pedal using rods and levers, while the rear brakes were also operated by cables from the <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Equipment {{levels for}} the base model [...] "Altise" [...] {{comprised}} (at launch) air conditioning, cruise control, power windows and mirrors, 16-inch steel wheels, and a single-disc CD player. The [...] "Sportivo" [...] grade added 17-inch alloy wheels, a body kit, front fog lamps, bolstered electrically adjustable front seats, leather-bound steering wheel, gear and <b>handbrake</b> <b>levers,</b> side and curtain airbags, and an in-dash six-CD player. Building on the [...] "Altise" [...] specification, the [...] "Ateva" [...] gained 16-inch alloy wheels, a chrome grille surround, fog lamps, dual zone climate control air conditioning, side and curtain airbags, a six-stack CD audio system, power-adjustable front seats, automatic headlamps, trip {{computer and a}} leather-wrapped steering wheel, gear and <b>handbrake</b> <b>levers.</b> Furthering this, the [...] "Grande" [...] specification incorporates leather upholstery, wood grain inserts, satellite navigation, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), Bluetooth connectivity, rain-sensing windscreen wipers, a sunroof and an electrically operated rear window blind.|$|R
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 4: U van type 6 (1217-1466) (<b>lever</b> <b>handbrake)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Speed and <b>handbrake</b> <b>levers</b> are now {{central and}} a tail lamp is {{supplied}} at no extra charge. The front seat {{is a single}} seat but it has an 8-inch range of adjustment. The side windows have quick action winders, the driver's is a lever not winder. One windscreen wiper is provided and provision made for another. The top of the steering wheel has controls for the horn, dimming the headlamps, and the spark and the throttle. Wire wheels continue to be provided. The spare remains behind the petrol tank {{in front of the}} folding luggage grid.|$|R
2500|$|The {{ratchet control}} {{button on the}} end of a fly-off {{handbrake}} is designed to work in the opposite way to what is normally accepted. If the lever is lifted or pulled back to the [...] "on" [...] position, on letting go it immediately releases unless the end button is pressed and held in place before letting go of the lever. Once set, the brake is released by lifting the <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever</b> (not pushing the button) in the setting direction (up or back). This mechanism was traditionally fitted to sports cars to facilitate a racing get-away, such as at traffic lights. It can also be used to help the back wheels to slide, without the worry of the ratchet leaving the brake on.|$|E
5000|$|... {{center console}} and the <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever</b> {{are covered with}} leather, adorned by {{delicate}} seams; in the V10 models the molding around the standard navigation system plus is also leather-covered.|$|E
50|$|As standard, {{the car had}} a bench {{front seat}} but {{individual}} seats were available as an option. To allow for the bench seat, the <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever</b> was between the seat and the door.|$|E
5000|$|Jim Sambrooks of Doncaster Corporation and South Yorkshire PTE {{recalled}} a Doncaster engineering foreman saying [...] "If it's a Seddon it's a dead 'un." [...] Again {{referring to the}} unlikelihood of pulling up in a straight line, he also recalled the first batch had car-type <b>handbrake</b> <b>levers</b> which disintegrated in use; later upon becoming a fitter he discovered that the brake adjusters (of two different sorts on the different batches) were virtually inaccessible, that spring shackle-pins often needed to be knocked out which was equally difficult, that topping up the fluid flywheel was [...] "nigh-on impossible" [...] and only done when a bus developed gearbox-slip, and {{that in order to}} remove the engines for overhaul, Doncaster engineers actually had to cut-away the rear cross member and bolt in a removable piece of girder once they had done. Problems on the Doncaster Pennine bodies included rivets falling out and frame-fractures above the exit door.|$|R
50|$|On 30-98s braking was a {{mechanical}} {{system with the}} pedal operating a transmission brake. The brakes on the rear wheels were controlled by a large <b>lever</b> (<b>handbrake).</b> Front-wheel brakes became available in late 1923, at first operated by Bowden double-cable but hydraulically from 1926.|$|R
50|$|The final {{development}} of the long U type van design, the only change made over the type 5's was {{the replacement of the}} wheel <b>handbrake</b> for a <b>lever</b> type. All of these wagons were constructed, from new, with two axles spaced 15 ft apart, autocouplers and the Westinghouse air brake system.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{a limited}} (2,000 units a year) version of C70 with choice of three colours (Black Stone (Solid), Black Sapphire (Metallic) and Ice White (Solid)), 18-inch Midir wheels in black with {{polished}} spokes and outer perimeter, high-gloss paint on the grille and the LED Daytime Running Lights surrounded by contrasting chrome, an exclusive leather-covered dashboard with contrasting stitching, Sovereign Hide upholstery in Off Black or Calcite with the same contrasting stitching as on dashboard, <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever</b> and carpets; [...] "Inscription" [...] embroidered on the front headrests, special Inscription carpets and <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever,</b> steering wheel and gear shift knob with aluminium inlays, sports pedals with aluminium inlay, aluminium inlay in centre stack (optional Black or Nordic Light Oak) ...|$|E
50|$|A {{luggage boot}} was added {{at the back}} with a {{separate}} lockable compartment for a spare wheel. Other additions were footrests for the back passengers, an electric cigarette lighter, a sunshine roof, double screen wipers, sun visors, and a new pistol-grip <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever</b> on the dash.|$|E
5000|$|Steering was by cam and lever. The four-wheel brakes were {{initially}} Lockheed hydraulic. The <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever,</b> {{designed for use}} as a parking brake, operated on the back wheels using cables. [...] "The lower gears can be used as an emergency brake". Tyres were 4.5 x 19 inches ...|$|E
5000|$|The Lancia Gamma was a {{front-wheel drive}} car with longitudinally-mounted boxer engines. It was {{available}} {{with either a}} 5-speed manual transmission or later a 4-speed automatic transmission. There were effectively two series of the Gamma, though Lancia referred to the change merely as a [...] "face-lift". The main change was that the engines went from carburettors to Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection. At {{the same time a}} lot of cosmetic work was done; the cars got a new corporate grille, 15-inch [...] "sunburst" [...] alloy wheels, and a slightly upgraded interior, with new instrumentation and interior lighting, new badging, a new style <b>handbrake</b> and gear <b>lever</b> gaitor.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} model usually {{featured a}} choice of a 1407 cc OHV (T) or 1588 cc OHV (2T) engine, choice of a four-speed manual gearbox, two-speed automatic gearbox or three-speed automatic gearbox and front-wheel disc brakes (drum brakes on the lowest model). It was revised in 1972 with a restyled body, new rear light cluster, filler cap repositioned in the rear quarter panel, restyled front grille and fascia. The specification was once again revised in 1974 including sealed cooling system, improved brakes, restyled wheels with flared wheel arches, and restyled interior fittings.In late October 1975 (on sale 1 November), the Carina received a new front and rear-end styling, dual-line braking system with servo, and a repositioned <b>handbrake</b> and gear <b>lever</b> in a modified dashboard. The wheelbase and tread were increased slightly, as for the sister Celica series. Some chassis codes were accordingly changed, and the Japanese market cars received a plethora of altered engines, ranging from 1.4 to 2.0 liters.|$|R
5000|$|The Porsche Design Edition 1 is a Cayman S model {{designed}} by Porsche Design, commemorating the 35th anniversary of Porsche Design. The all black car has {{a black leather}} interior on the seats, dashboard, and door trim, as well as black Alcantara steering wheel, gear <b>lever,</b> <b>handbrake</b> grip, and headliner. The DE1 also is fitted standard with the Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), 19-inch 911 (997) Turbo wheels with 235/35 ZR 19 front and 265/35 ZR 19 rear tires, Porsche Design script on the instrument dials, stainless steel entry plate engraved with [...] "Porsche Design Edition 1", all-red rear taillights, custom vinyl exterior black-on-black graphics, and a numbered plaque on the glovebox cover. As with all PASM-equipped cars, the body is lowered by 10 mm. Standard equipment includes a briefcase containing the Flat Six Chronograph, a pocket knife, a pair of sunglasses, a pen, and a key ring - all in black, even the knife blade.|$|R

Each wheel had a drum brake; all four were operated through the pedal using rods and levers, while the rear brakes were also operated by cables from the <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|E
50|$|EPB systems afford {{packaging}} and manufacturing advances, since {{it allows for}} an uncluttered central console {{in the absence of}} the traditional <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever</b> (many manufacturers have used the freed up space to place the controls for their infotainment systems), plus it reduces manufacturing complexity since it removes the need to route bowden cables underneath the vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|From September 1969, {{the base}} 2.5 L-engine was pumped up {{to at the}} same time, both {{remaining}} engines received hydraulic lifters for smoother running, a new exhaust system and six camshaft bearings. The <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever</b> was moved from its position under the dash to a location between the front seats and the fuel tank was enlarged from 55 to 70 litres.|$|E
50|$|The {{position}} of the handbrake and change-speed levers has been changed. A new shape of <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever</b> {{is now on the}} right side of the driver but allows entry through that doorway. The change-speed lever is now in the centre of the car and is of the flexible type working in an invisible gate. It has very short travel allowing three passengers in front.|$|E
5000|$|Reporting {{again in}} March 1934 The Times drew {{attention}} to the gearbox's free-wheel, quiet-third and synchromesh on the three top speeds. [...] "Automatic clutch control" [...] eliminated use of the clutch even for starting or stopping. Automatic engine restarting was fitted. The steering wheel was too large though distracting rather than obstructive. The <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever</b> was awkwardly shaped and positioned. The car remained smooth and quiet.|$|E
5000|$|The car has a {{top speed}} of 39 mph. [...] There is a {{transmission}} brake fitted behind the gearbox operated by foot pedal and internal expanding drum brakes on the back axle operated by the <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever.</b> Springing is by semi-elliptic leaf springs on both front and rear axles with an additional crossways helper spring on the rear of some of the cars. Artillery type wheels were fitted.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interior}} had individual leather trimmed {{seats in}} front spaced closely together {{to allow a}} central passenger to be carried. The gear change was either on the column or floor-mounted and the <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever</b> between the driver's seat and the door. Other improvements highlighted at the time included an enlarged luggage compartment with counterbalanced lid and increased elbow width on both front and rear seats. [...] A heater could be fitted as an option.|$|E
50|$|In {{keeping with}} the {{up-market}} positioning of the Wolseley brand the car had upmarket trim with polished walnut dashboard and door cappings and leather seats and a traditional Wolseley radiator grille with illuminated badge. The individual front seats were placed very closely together to allow the car {{to be used as}} a six seater albeit marginal but it was usually sold as a four seater. The <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever</b> was under the dash. A heater was fitted as standard.|$|E
5000|$|The 540i LE (ie. Limited Edition) [...] "right hand drive" [...] sedan {{was sold}} in Australia. This model {{included}} the interior from the M5, [...] "throwing star" [...] M-System II wheels, EDC suspension with self leveling rear, Servotronic power steering, and front air dam. 70 of these 540i LE sedans were produced, all with a manual transmission, each individually numbered and identified by an engraved metal plaque stuck onto the centre console beneath the <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Hillman 16 had a 2110 cc 15.90 hp {{side valve}} straight-six engine whilst the {{matching}} 20/70 had larger 2810 cc 20.9 hp engines. The [...] "16hp" [...] and “20/70” saloons were five seaters with bucket {{seats at the}} front and a folding armrest dividing a bench seat at the rear. All these vehicles had Bendix [...] "Duo Servo" [...] brakes, which used rod and cable linkages and operated on all four wheels via both the foot pedal and the <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{line with}} {{changes to the}} {{corresponding}} Oxford line, BMC redesigned the Isis for 1956 with updated styling including a more elaborate mesh grille, chrome side strips and small fins. The engine power increased to [...] An automatic transmission option was also added. The manual version had a four-speed box operated by a short gearstick {{on the right-hand side}} of the front bench seat. The <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever</b> was just behind the gearstick. Sales remained weak, and the line ended in 1958.|$|E
50|$|Caddy Life has a {{flexible}} seating system. The two {{rear bench seat}} rows can {{be taken out of}} the vehicle altogether to give the vehicle 2850 litres of cargo room; in addition, the Caddy Life has a 1500 kg towing capacity. In 2005, a Special Edition Caddy Life Colour Concept with two distinctive colours, Red Spice and Ravenna Blue, was released with upholstery fabrics, floor mats {{and a variety of other}} elements on the dash panel in the same colour as the exterior body, and a leather trimmed steering wheel, gear and <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Light 20 has a {{top speed}} of 50 mph (52 mph on the TT versions) and the Heavy 20 47 mph. This speed would be reduced if a heavy body was fitted. There is a {{transmission}} brake operating on a drum fitted behind the gearbox operated by foot pedal and internal expanding drum brakes on the back axle operated by the <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever.</b> Suspension is by semi-elliptic leaf springs on both front and rear axles with an additional crossways helper spring on the rear. Artillery type wheels with wooden spokes were fitted.|$|E
50|$|It {{was well}} {{equipped}} with leather and nylon upholstery for its bench {{front and rear}} seats and woven pile carpet. A heater was fitted as standard. The radio remained an option on the home market. Other options included fog lamps, reversing light, locking filler cap and external mirrors. In {{order to keep the}} front floor clear to seat six people the <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever</b> was mounted under the dashboard and the gearchange lever was column mounted. The car could be ordered painted in either single or two tone colours.|$|E
5000|$|... 1981 - Introduction of the TX and GTX with 1,995 cc engine (rated at [...] ) and {{five-speed}} manual gearbox. TX has same specification as GTS. GTX as GTS and TX, plus rear wash/wipe, {{front fog}} lights, headlamp wash/wipe, 14-inch alloy wheels (185/65 HR14), leather {{on the steering}} wheel rim, gearlever gaiter, and <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever</b> gaiter, as well as digital clock, passenger side door mirror, bronze tinted windows, luggage cover, and airhorn. The optional three-speed automatic transmission now available on the 2-litre TX rather than in the 1.6-litre, beginning in September 1981.|$|E
50|$|The KR175 {{used the}} {{standard}} Kabinenroller steering system, with a steering bar connected {{directly to the}} track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small, measured inputs. The KR175's steering bar was made from tubular steel. The gearshift lever, {{on the right side}} of the cockpit, had a secondary lever on it which operated the clutch. The throttle was operated by a twist-grip on the left handlebar. The foot brake pedal, which was the only pedal in the car, operated brakes on all three wheels mechanically, using cables. The <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever</b> operated similarly.|$|E
50|$|Styling {{was entirely}} new though the rounded body {{maintained}} a family {{resemblance to the}} Morris Minor. Again, a pair of four-seat configurations, 4-door saloon and 2-door Traveller, were offered. The column gear change and front bench seat allowed the saloon to be advertised as a full six-seater. The <b>handbrake</b> <b>lever</b> was located between {{the side of the}} seat and the driver's side door. Unusually for a British car of its class at the time, the heater was a standard fitting but the radio remained an extra. Sales remained strong when the Series III arrived in 1956.|$|E
