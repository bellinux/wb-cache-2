50|$|It is {{an offence}} under section 125 {{of the act}} to obtain access to the Internet {{when there is no}} {{intention}} to pay for that service. The legislation was intended to prevent the major defrauding of communications companies. Nevertheless, the individual practice <b>of</b> piggybacking (the <b>illicit</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a Wi-Fi <b>connection</b> to access another subscriber's Internet service) was demonstrated to be a contravention of the act by R v Straszkiewicz in 2005. There have been subsequent arrests for the practice. Piggybacking may also be a breach of the Computer Misuse Act 1990. Section 125 of the act has been criticised for its vagueness, resulting in the possibility that many users of portable Wi-Fi enabled devices may be inadvertently breaching it.|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} whether the <b>illicit</b> practice <b>of</b> <b>using</b> personal <b>connections</b> to acquire goods and services, or to circumvent formal procedures, known as blat in the Soviet era, persists in the post-Soviet world, 200 face-to-face interviews {{conducted in the}} city of Mykolayiv in Ukraine are reported. The finding is that personal networks are still commonly and widely used. However, unlike Soviet era blat which was non-monetized friendly help, control over access to assets and possessing personal connections to those controlling access to assets, has become a commodity bought and sold for illicit monetary payments. The paper concludes by discussing how this corrupt practice might be tackled. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
40|$|This study, {{conducted}} in Columbus, Ohio, identified the predictors of current (past 30 day) <b>illicit</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> pharmaceutical opioids among young individuals (n = 402) {{with a history}} <b>of</b> MDMA/ecstasy <b>use</b> who were recruited in 2002 – 2003 using respondent-driven sampling. To be eligible, participants had to be 18 – 30 years old, not involved in a drug abuse treatment, and report MDMA/ecstasy use {{at least once in}} the past 6 months. About 81 % reported lifetime, and more than 31 % reported current <b>illicit</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> pharmaceutical opioids. Logistic regression analysis revealed that <b>illicit</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> pharmaceutical tranquilizers and pharmaceutical stimulants were the strongest predictors <b>of</b> <b>illicit</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> pharmaceutical opioids. Risk <b>of</b> pharmaceutical opioid <b>use</b> was also greater among those who had higher levels of depressive symptoms and reported current <b>use</b> <b>of</b> hallucinogens and inhalants. Our findings suggest that the non-medical <b>use</b> <b>of</b> pharmaceutical opioids is a part <b>of</b> polydrug <b>use</b> practices that often incorporate <b>illicit</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> other prescription drugs. The observed relationship between depressive symptoms and <b>illicit</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> pharmaceutical opioids may have important implications for prevention programming and should be examined in future research...|$|R
40|$|Background <b>Illicit</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{methadone}} and buprenorphine {{has been}} described as a growing problem in Sweden in recent years, and has been associated with an increased drug-related mortality. Critics claim that the substances have become popular among adolescents and that they function as a gateway to heroin <b>use.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this study is to investigate, firstly, the extent to which <b>illicit</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> methadone and buprenorphine occurs among adolescents and young adults in Sweden, and secondly, at what stage in a user's drug career these substances tend to appear. Methods The study is based on surveys and structured interviews on drug use among various populations of young people, in addition to qualitative interviews with 86 informants who, in their professional capacity, encounter adolescents or young adults who are <b>using</b> <b>illicit</b> drugs. Results <b>Illicit</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> methadone and buprenorphine is rare among young people in Sweden. According to high school surveys, less than 0. 1 % have tried these substances. Among young drug users in general, few have tried the substances, and there is nothing to indicate that they act as gateway drugs. Among adolescents and young adults with severe drug problems, however, the <b>illicit</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> methadone and buprenorphine is more common (54 % in a compulsory care sample). These substances normally enter the drug career late, and few use them as their main drug of choice. Other prescription drugs, like benzodiazepines and tramadol, are used by adolescents to a far greater extent. Diversion and <b>illicit</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> methadone and buprenorphine is not seen as a serious problem by the professionals interviewed. A general view is that the substances are mainly used by people with a heroin or polydrug addiction, often for "self-medication" purposes. However, several informants express concern that methadone and buprenorphine may cause fatalities among young drug users without an opioid tolerance. Conclusions <b>Illicit</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> methadone and buprenorphine among young drug users is not a widespread problem in Sweden. Harm-reduction measures should target drug users with more severe problems, among whom <b>illicit</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> methadone and buprenorphine is more common and pose a medical risk. <b>Illicit</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> other prescription drugs, which are less controlled and more widely used by young people, is an important issue for further research...|$|R

40|$|Although {{in several}} {{countries}} heroin addicts {{have been found to}} engage in <b>illicit</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> methadone, no studies have been addressed to this behavior in Italy. The present study gives evidence that methadone dispensed by public health services in Rome is paralleled by a black market in this drug. Of sixty-five heroin addicts hospitalized for medical or surgical problems, the majority (89. 2 %) referred to the existence of an illicit methadone market in Rome, and 38 % used it. When asked why they bought illicit methadone the addicts stated that the daily dose obtainable from public health services was inadequate. However this statement is in contrast with the evidence that the heroin addicts <b>using</b> <b>illicit</b> methadone had highest daily doses similar to those of heroin addicts not referring to the illicit methadone market. We wonder whether <b>illicit</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> methadone is influenced by the therapeutic benefit that addicts expect to obtain from methadone. These "expectations" may lead heroin addicts to extend consumption of methadone to alleviate problems altogether unrelated to the withdrawal syndrome. If so, the illicit market in methadone may be sustained not by the drug's addictive properties but by its therapeutic effects...|$|R
