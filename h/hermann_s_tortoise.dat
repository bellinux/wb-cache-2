40|$|A {{study of}} the {{reproduction}} of Krefft 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> river <b>tortoise,</b> Emydura krefftii, was conducted in the perched dune lakes of Fraser Island, Queensland. Mature male specimens exhibit a postnuptial pattern of spermatogenesis typical of temperate‐zone turtles elsewhere, with a peak in spermatogenic activity in autumn and a cessation of activity during the breeding season in spring and early summer. The spermatogenic cycle is paralleled by seasonal variation in testicular weight (standardized for body size) and in {{the diameter of the}} seminiferous tubules. Sperm are abundant in the epididymal canals throughout the year. Mating was observed in autumn, late winter and spring. Females have a cyclic reproductive pattern, with distinct phases of follicular enlargement, ovulation and oviducal period, and quiescence. Yolk begins to accumulate in the ovaries in late summer, and the accumulation continues unabated through the winter, presumably by the transfer of material from fat stores to the ovaries. Ovulations occur from late winter to mid‐summer. Atresia of follicles that fail to ovulate was demonstrated histologically. Emydura krefftii lay up to three clutches of hard‐shelled ellipsoid eggs per season. Each clutch contains between four and 10 eggs; the number is strongly correlated with maternal body size. Reproductive potential ranges from 12 eggs per annum for a female that has recently matured (carapace length c. 150 mm), to 30 eggs per annum for a full‐sized female (length c. 250 mm).

Based on [45], 45 % of the streams have a lifetime of less than 2 s, 53 % have a lifetime between 2 s and 15 min, and the rest has life times more than 15 min (usually in the order of hours).

The idea of planned introductions for conservation is a controversial issue, prompting vigorous, and sometimes ill-informed, debate in the scientific literature. The broad consensus was that this represented a bold new direction that had merit but carried great risk. Unacknowledged by most commentators, assisted colonisation (by other names) was already taking place, and in Australia and New Zealand was even a long-accepted part of the conservation management tool kit. In 2013, the IUCN recognised assisted colonisation as a legitimate, if inherently risky, conservation translocation, and set out a comprehensive set of guidelines for its application. We review the history of assisted colonisation, with a focus on Australian and New Zealand projects moving species in response to threats within the indigenous range.

40|$|Understanding {{the true}} {{incidence}} and prevalence {{of a disease}} has tremendous value for the biopharmaceutical industry, particularly for orphan diseases that affect {{a minority of the}} population (in the US, the definition of orphan disease is a disorder that must affect less than 200, 000 people, or 1 in 1, 500). However, incidence and prevalence data for orphan diseases in scientific literature is poorly studied, inconsistent, numbers range widely and articles often contain poorly supported citations. Additionally, once a treatment is available and disease awareness increases, there may be an increase in reported disease prevalence, as patients proactively seek treatment from their healthcare providers. The goal of this research is to investigate the incidence of X-linked Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia (XLHED) and provide a framework for investigators to study the incidence and prevalence of other rare diseases. Specific research objectives include: 1) Develop a clinical phenotype to identify XLHED patients in medical records and/or claims data 2) Analyze patient registry data to identify characteristics that are unique to XLHED and distinguish XLHED from other ectodermal dysplasias 3) Develop a robust search algorithm to accurately identify XLHED patients in claims databases By performing a thorough literature review, and an analysis of the National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias (NFED) patient registry, I was able to meet the first two research objectives. After analyzing the medical record and claims data at two major academic medical centers, we were only able to identify 25 total patients, 19 of whom had associated claims data, to include in our patient cohort. Since this number was too small of a base from which to develop an identification algorithm as originally planned, I instead analyzed descriptive statistics of their claims data in order to better understand how these patients flow through the healthcare system, and what identification criteria might be valuable for an investigator studying a larger patient population in the future. Further studies using different combinations of claims and/or narrative data to more accurately identify HED patients and therefore increase the sample size of future analyses are recommended to continue this epidemiological research and provide new insights into the diagnosis and treatment patterns of XLHED. by Julie <b>Hermann.</b> Thesis (<b>S.</b> M.)

40|$|Archean sulfur mass-independent {{fractionation}} (S-MIF) {{has been}} widely {{recognized as one of}} the strongest indicators for the rise of atmospheric oxygen in the Early Proterozoic. A decade after its discovery, the wide-ranging implications of Archean sulfur MIF have been discussed extensively and despite a number of recent studies on the gas-phase chemistry of sulfur, no definite overall picture has emerged to date as to the precise origin and preservation of the Archean mass-independent sulfur signal. The interpretation of the Archean sulfur MIF as a strong constraint for atmospheric oxygen levels, however, requires a dominant atmospheric source of sulfur MIF. This study was aimed at investigating the potential contribution of the poorly explored mass-independent effects from liquid-phase sulfur chemistry and focused on sulfur isotope fractionation during liquid-phase photolytic breakdown of phenacylphenylsulfone (PPS) as a model system for initial investigation. Results confirm that MIF in this system is caused by the magnetic 33 S isotope and excludes other mechanisms such as nuclear volume effects or vibronic coupling that would produce concomitant MIF in the 32 S- 34 _ 3 - 3 S triad. This provides a starting point for discussing the implications of magnetic isotope effects as a mechanism for mass-independent isotope fractionation in the chemical evolution of the sulfur cycle and suggests that liquid-phase processes such as the photolysis of PPS cannot constitute the principal source of mass-independent sulfur fractionation in the Archean. by Sebastian <b>Hermann</b> Kopf.

New electrode materials are required to increase the energy density of Li/Na-ion batteries [1]. Fe based negative electrode materials for Li-ion batteries have been previously investigated to evaluate the electrochemical performances and elucidate the electrochemical reaction mechanisms. Mössbauer spectroscopy has been applied to a variety of fields including chemistry, physics, geology, biology…. In the domain of energy storage, Mössbauer spectroscopy has been used as a powerful tool to investigate the local electronic and structural properties of electrode materials and to determine their reaction mechanisms during charge and discharge of Li/Na-ion batteries [2]. In this poster, we will show from some selected examples how Mössbauer spectroscopy when used with X-ray diffraction can help to improve the performances of electrode materials for Alkali-ion batteries.

Program activities included: (1) biological surveys at proposed construction sites, (2) desert tortoise compliance, (3) ecosystem mapping and data management, (4) sensitive species and unique habitat monitoring, and (5) biological monitoring at the HAZMAT Spill Center. Biological surveys {{for the presence of}} sensitive species were conducted for 23 NTS projects. Eleven sites were in desert tortoise habitat. These projects have the potential to disturb a total of 588 acres, where 568 acres of disturbance would be off-road driving. No tortoises were found in or displaced from project areas, and no <b>tortoise</b> <b>s</b> were accidentally injured or killed at project areas. One tortoise was crushed by a vehicle on a paved road. A topical report describing the classification of habitat types on the NTS was completed and distributed. The report is the culmination of three years of field vegetation mapping and the analysis of vegetation data from over 1, 500 ecological landform units. Compilation of historical wildlife data was initiated. A long-term monitoring plan for important plant species that occur on the NTS was completed. Site-wide monitoring was conducted for the western burrowing owl, bat species of concern, wild horses, and raptor nests. Sixty-nine of 77 known owl burrows were monitored. As in previous years, some owls were present year round on the NTS. An overall decrease in active owl burrows was observed within all three ecoregions (Mojave Desert, Transition, Great Basin Desert) from October through January. An increase in active owl burrows was observed from mid March to early April. A total of 55 juvenile owls was detected from 11 breeding pairs. Pellet analysis of burrowing owls was completed which identified key prey species. A total of 272 bats, representing 10 bat species were captured in mist-nets at water sources in the Great Basin Desert ecoregion. Bats were detected with the Anabat II call-recording system at water sources and selected tunnel and mine entrances. Thirty-seven adult horses and 11 foals were counted this year. Two of the eleven foals observed last year survived to yearlings. Seven active raptor nests were found and monitored this year. These included two Great-horned Owl nests, three Barn Owl nests, and two Red-tailed Hawk nests. Selected wetlands and man-made water sources were monitored for physical parameters and wildlife use.

40|$|Organic {{materials}} such as liquid crystals and polymers offer unique optical and electro-optical properties, which make them ideal candidates for the realization of optoelectronic and sensing devices [1 - 6]. Liquid crystals are rather well assessed and definitely benefit from a mature technology, low cost, low driving voltages, short switching times, low losses and a wide spectral transparency from the visible to the near infrared. Polymers exhibit remarkable properties, among them a refractive index engineerable by varying their chemical composition and their compatibility with other materials, which allow large scale film deposition at low costs. In this Communication I will illustrate several integrated optoelectronic structures which exploit these materials. Among them is a bistable electro-optic switch realized by ion-exchange in glass and employing ferroelectric liquid crystals with polymeric alignment. The device, fully characterized at the wavelength 632. 8 nm, shows interesting properties ranging from a switching time as short as 300 us to an extinction ratio above 14 dB for a bias of only 5 V applied [7]. Another example is a guided-wave optical switch investigated using ferroelectric liquid crystals and polymers, in which light is confined in two polymeric films and with buffer layers to prevent losses in the near infrared by light absorption in the ITO electrodes. This switch, optimized in terms of extinction ratios and losses for various layers thicknesses, polymer compositions and liquid crystals refractive indices, has an extinction ratio better than 50 dB and propagation losses lower than 1 dB for a compact structure of just 174 um in length [8 - 9]. An electro-optic router can be obtained based on mode mixing. The design of such configuration, quite promising in terms of crosstalk and versatility [10], is presently under optimization. The device, based on a bi-modal nematic liquid crystal waveguide of an overall length < 500 um, can be driven to route an optical signal to either one of two output gates by virtue of a small voltage modulation < 1 V.
