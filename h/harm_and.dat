5|$|Since {{this report}} was released, several {{independent}} reviews {{have examined the}} body of published research for a possible thiomersal-autism link by examining the theoretical mechanisms of thiomersal causing <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> by reviewing the in vitro, animal, and population {{studies that have been}} published. These reviews determined that no significant evidence exists to establish thiomersal as the cause of autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.|$|E
5|$|You {{have more}} to do than simply abstain from riotous proceedings. You must not stand behind riots and let violators of the law promote the {{destruction}} of property.

5|$|As her {{research}} progressed, Carson found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and {{environmental effects of}} pesticides. She also took advantage of her personal connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps {{when it came to}} pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> willing to consider alternative methods such as biological pest control.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the second}} trial, a further 26 {{defendants}} were still {{due to be}} tried on charges relating to the riot. The Crown Prosecution Service accepted plea bargains where defendants pleaded guilty to violent disorder {{in exchange for the}} dropping of other charges, or in some cases all charges were dropped completely. On 20 September 1993 the last remaining defendant to maintain a plea of not guilty went on trial, and he was convicted of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> sentenced to thirty months imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Hit points (HP) are {{a measure}} of a character's {{vitality}} and health and {{are determined by the}} class, level and constitution of each character. They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to <b>harm,</b> <b>and</b> loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game. Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores or character levels. When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.|$|E
5|$|Humans had {{free will}} to ignore divine {{guidance}} {{and the behavior}} required by maat, but by doing so they could bring divine punishment upon themselves. A deity carried out this punishment using its ba, the force that manifested the god's power in the human world. Natural disasters and human ailments were seen {{as the work of}} angry divine bas. Conversely, the gods could cure righteous people of illness or even extend their lifespans. Both these types of intervention were eventually represented by deities: Shed, who emerged in the New Kingdom to represent divine rescue from <b>harm,</b> <b>and</b> Petbe, an apotropaic god from the late eras of Egyptian history who was believed to avenge wrongdoing.|$|E

5|$|Likewise, in Middle English {{and early}} modern Scottish evidence, while still {{appearing}} as causes of <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> danger, elves appear clearly as human-like beings. They became associated with medieval chivalric romance traditions of fairies and {{particularly with the}} idea of a Fairy Queen. A propensity to seduce or rape people becomes increasingly prominent in the source material. Around the fifteenth century, evidence starts to appear for the belief that elves might steal human babies and replace them with changelings.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, Palmer endorses the no-contact {{version of}} the LFI. She defends the {{distinction}} between doing and allowing <b>harm,</b> <b>and</b> then defends the idea that humans have different positive obligations towards domestic animals and wild animals. At the centre of Palmer's approach {{is the fact that}} humans are causally responsible for the hardship faced by some animals, but not the hardship faced by others. She then deploys this philosophy in a number of imagined cases in which humans have varying relations to particular animals in need. She closes the book by considering possible objections, including the idea that her approach would not require someone to save a drowning child at little cost to themselves.|$|E
5|$|Crash Bandicoot is a mutated {{bandicoot}} {{who must}} travel through time and stop Doctor Neo Cortex from gathering the Crystals. He is aided by Aku Aku, an ancient witch doctor mask who protects Crash from <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> gives him sage advice between levels. Also helping Crash is {{his younger sister}} Coco Bandicoot, who gathers the Crystals on the Great Wall of China, on the surfaces above Atlantis and in the skies of World War I Europe. Crash's enemy, Doctor Neo Cortex, has been aided by his mentor, Aku Aku's twin brother Uka Uka. Aku Aku previously locked Uka Uka away to protect the world from him, but has been freed because of Cortex's bumblings. Aiding Doctor Cortex and Uka Uka is Doctor Nefarious Tropy, the self-proclaimed master {{of time and the}} creator of the Time Twisting Machine used to gather Crystals and Gems in different time periods. Cortex's other allies include Tiny Tiger, a tall, hulking beast who battles Crash in the Colosseum; Dingodile, a half-dingo half-crocodile hybrid with a large flamethrower; and Doctor N. Gin, a scientist with a missile in his head.|$|E

5|$|Delaney had {{a lifelong}} history of helping others, and once {{paid for the}} funeral of a former teacher whose family could not afford a proper service. On June 29, 1983, Delaney, who was living in nearby Ruston, went with friends to Critter's Creek, an {{amusement}} center at Chennault Park in Monroe, Louisiana. While reportedly discouraging swimming children from venturing too far out in a pond, Delaney dove in to save three children who were screaming for help, floundering in a water hole left by recent construction work. The water hole, which covered two acres and was six feet deep, was not intended for swimming but {{to add to the}} park's aesthetics. Despite his inability to swim, Delaney nevertheless tried to rescue the children. One child managed {{to get out of the}} water without <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> another was taken to an emergency room where he later died; police recovered the body of Delaney and the remaining child. The amusement park has since been closed to the public.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other uses}} have been {{researched}} for bupropion. There has been controversy {{about whether it}} is useful to add an antidepressant such as bupropion to a mood stabilizer in people with bipolar depression, but recent reviews have concluded that bupropion in this situation does no significant <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> may sometimes give significant benefit. Bupropion has shown no effectiveness in the treatment of cocaine dependence, but there is weak evidence that it may be useful in treating methamphetamine dependence. Based on studies indicating that bupropion lowers the level of the inflammatory mediator TNF-alpha, there have been suggestions that it might be useful in treating inflammatory bowel disease or other autoimmune conditions, but very little clinical evidence is available. Bupropion—like other antidepressants, with the exception of duloxetine (Cymbalta)—is not effective in treating chronic low back pain. It does, however, show some promise in the treatment of neuropathic pain.|$|E
5|$|The story then {{shifts to}} four years later, where Marley forces {{including}} Titan Shifters like Zeke and Reiner, as well as warriors in training to inherit their powers are fighting against another nation called the Mid-East Allied Forces. Though Marley wins the war, they are devastated by the new invention of Anti-Titan artillery which can seriously <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> even kill the most well fortified Titan Shifters. Thus Zeke tells Marley military command that they must once again attempt to steal Eren's Coordinate power or Marley's position as a world hegemony will cease. As the Marleyan military prepares for another attempt to invade Paradis, Eren infiltrates the country by assuming the disguise of a wounded and amputated soldier named Mr. Kruger who uses Falco Grice, one of the prospective warriors who desire to inherit the Armored Titan to gain information. The Tyburs, an influential and highly-respected political clan led by Willy who is the current holder of the War Hammer Titan, secretly control the Marley government and decide to assist the warriors for the imminent invasion of Paradis.|$|E

5|$|Kim Possible {{takes place}} {{primarily}} within the fictional United States town of Middleton, {{and focuses on}} the life and adventures of teenager Kim Possible. She is an accomplished high school student and cheerleader who fights crime on a regular basis, assisted by her best friend and sidekick, Ron Stoppable, and Rufus, his pet naked mole rat. Ron's personal fears, insecurities and clumsiness sometimes {{have a tendency to}} jeopardize the success of their own missions. Kim and Ron are aided remotely by Wade, a 10 year-old computer genius who seldom leaves his bedroom and communicates with the duo via device he invented himself known as a Kimmunicator. Together, the foursome is known as Team Possible. The majority of Kim's missions involve her traveling to various destinations around the world to rescue citizens from <b>harm</b> <b>and</b> battle a variety of enemies and villains, the most frequent of whom are Dr. Drakken, a mad scientist constantly plotting world domination, and his superpowered sidekick Shego, who possesses the ability to generate powerful energy blasts and emit them from her hands, making her the heroine's most dangerous opponent. Not yet of age to drive herself to most of her missions, Kim often relies on favors from various people and friends she has assisted in the past for transportation.|$|E
