40|$|The paper briefly {{presents}} the results of experimental research on the influence of using zinc <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>galvanized</b> rebar on the durability of reinforced concrete. For this purpose, the loss of adherence between the rebar and the concrete matrix was determined, as well as the reduction of resistance to splitting due to accelerated corrosion of samples of <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>galvanized</b> rebar vs. steel not protected against corrosion.

50|$|Pipe {{supports}} are fabricated from {{a variety}} of materials including structural steel, carbon steel, stainless steel, galvanized steel, aluminum, ductile iron and FRP composites. Most pipe supports are coated to protect against moisture and corrosion. Some methods for corrosion protection include: painting, zinc coatings, <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>galvanizing</b> or a combination of these.

50|$|The use of zinc {{chloride}} as a flux, sometimes {{in a mixture}} with ammonium chloride (see also Zinc ammonium chloride), involves the production of HCl and its subsequent reaction with surface oxides. Zinc chloride forms two salts with ammonium chloride, (NH4)ZnCl4 and (NH4)3ClZnCl4, which decompose on heating liberating HCl just as {{zinc chloride}} hydrate does.

40|$|Titanium hexafluoride pretreatments {{are known}} to improve paint {{adhesion}} and function as a barrier between the coating and the <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>galvanized</b> (HDG) steel surface. Interactions at the zinc/pretreatment interface are of utmost importance {{for the formation of}} pretreatment layers and the corrosion resistance of color coated <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>galvanized</b> steels. Removal rate of inert aluminum oxide from HDG steel samples by chemical dissolution was studied. XPS measurements showed that the surface Al 2 O 3 layer thickness decreased rapidly already at mild alkaline cleaning, while complete removal of Al required severe etching. Low reactivity of an Al 2 O 3 -rich surface was confirmed by impaired formation of a titanium hexafluoride pretreatment layer. Grain boundaries and deformation twinnings were shown to be of importance for the reactivity of the HDG surface and for the precipitation of the pretreatment chemical. Helium ion microscopy images and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) of a pretreated sample showed accumulation of the pretreatment chemical at the grain boundaries. Al removal rate was fast at the deformation twinnings at the grain plateaus. Slow Al removal was observed at dendritic valleys and grain boundaries.

Always a technology buff, Sadriwalla spotted an opportunity to supply special purpose computers to the aviation industry in 1990 and successfully launched a company called ADS (Application Designed Systems) Associates. After specialty computers became less relevant in a rapidly changing technology marketplace, he diversified into the pager business and built a highly profitable company called Pageco International to manufacture pager crystals. As pagers were displaced by cell phones, Abbas moved into Wi-Fi technology.Pursuing his interest in R&D Sadriwalla is currently the CEO of Liquiguard Technololgies, Inc., a specialty coatings manufacturer that develops unique coating solutions for everyday objects.

40|$|Surface {{chemistry}} and reactivity of skin-passed <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>galvanized</b> coating This paper aims at describing surface {{chemistry and}} reactivity of skin-passed <b>hot</b> <b>dip</b> <b>galvanized</b> coatings. GI coatings surfaces {{are covered by}} a very thin aluminum oxide 5 nm thick layer that precipitates just immediately after wiping. Anisotropic growing of zinc crystals during solidification induces a strong basal texture in GI coatings. Metallic aluminum is rejected in the last liquid during solidification, and so accumulates along zinc grain boundaries {{and close to the}} free surface. Skin-pass induced changes in GI coating surface chemistry, crystallography and reactivity have been assessed. Local coating analyses have been performed (XPS, TOF-SIMS) in order to describe local effects of roughness indentation during skin-pass on coating characteristics. A laboratory bi-crushing device has been used on not skin-passed GI coatings, in order to reproduce on large scales heavy deformations that exist locally when skin-pass roll roughness peaks indent the coating. Such a protocol allowed analyzing the way aluminum oxide is crushed down in the zinc coating during deformation, then re-build during ageing.
