40|$|English is {{a typical}} SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) {{language}}, while Japanese {{is a typical}} SOV language. Conventional Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems work well within each of these language families. However, SMT-based translation from an SVO language to an SOV language does not work well because their word orders are completely different. Recently, a few groups have proposed rulebased preprocessing methods to mitigate this problem (Xu et al., 2009; Hong et al., 2009). These methods rewrite SVO sentences to derive more SOV-like sentences by using a set of handcrafted rules. In this paper, we propose an alternative single reordering rule: Head Finalization. This is a syntax-based preprocessing approach that offers the advantage of simplicity. We do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> partof-speech tags or rule weights because the powerful Enju parser allows us to implement the rule at a general level. Our experiments show that its result, Head Final English (HFE), follows almost the same order as Japanese. We also show that this rule improves automatic evaluation scores. ...|$|E

From the research it has become apparent that {{there is a lack of}} awareness about pensions, and that the main reasons for this are due to, limited information being provided to young people, and only from a few different methods.

However, researchers have failed to show which method will bring about an increase in organisational performance, which {{is the bottom line}} for business organizations. The study proposes that higher education institutions (HEIs) can be regarded as businesses, and thus, also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> their performance within competitive environments. Using a quantitative methodology, we set out to explore the environments in four public HEIs in South Africa and sought information on their use of deliberate strategy. The study then compared their use of strategy with their performance (determined by their research outputs – an inarguable measure of performance in the current South African higher education landscape). The paper further compared two types of HEIs in South Africa, namely traditional universities and universities of technology. Statistical significance testing was done to determine mean differences between the various groups. The paper found that with regard to deliberate strategic management processes deployed, {{there were no significant differences}} between the types of institution. However, a significant finding was that more deliberate use of strategic management was likely to result in higher research outputs in HEIs.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} gastroesophageal reflux diseases (GERD) and coronary heart diseases. METHODS: One thousand nine hundred and seventy consecutive patients who attended our hospital were enrolled. All of the patients who first attend our hospital {{were asked to respond}} to the F-scale questionnaire regardless of their chief complaints. All patients had a careful history taken, and resting echocardiography (ECG) was performed by physicians if the diagnostic necessity arose. Patients with ECG signs of coronary artery ischemia were defined as ST-segment depression based on the Minnesota code. RESULTS: Among 712 patients (36 %) with GERD, ECG was performed in 171 (24 %), and ischemic changes were detected in eight (5 %). Four (50 %) of these patients with abnormal findings upon ECG had no chest symptoms such as chest pain, chest oppression, or palpitations. These patients (0. 6 %; 4 / 712) were thought to have non-GERD heartburn, which may be related to ischemic heart disease. Of 281 patients who underwent ECG and did not have GERD symptoms, 20 (7 %) had abnormal findings upon ECG. In patients with GERD symptoms and ECG signs of coronary artery ischemia, the prevalence of linked angina was considered to be 0. 4 % (8 / 1970 patients). CONCLUSION: The present study suggested that ischemic heart disease might be found although a patient was referred to the hospital with a complaint of GERD symptoms. Physicians <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> missing clinically important coronary artery disease while evaluating patients for GERD symptoms...|$|E
