Reviewing 2003 Slayer box set Soundtrack to the Apocalypse, Adrien Begrand of PopMatters dubbed the album [...] "a unique record [...] It's as if they're {{stepping}} in {{to show the}} young bands how to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>right,</b> as songs like 'Bitter Peace', 'Death's Head', and the terrific 'Stain of Mind' blow away anything that young pretenders have put out." [...] Writing in The Guardian, journalist Joel McIver said although the album was as musically heavy and lyrically dark as any of Slayer's previous releases, it exhibited the groove-based style of the then popular nu-metal sound.|$|E

500|$|... "Beautiful Liar" [...] {{was written}} by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Amanda Ghost, Ian Dench, and Beyoncé. It was {{produced}} by Eriksen and Hermansen using their stage name, Stargate, and Beyoncé. Eriksen told Sound on Sound, [...] "This song is very simple. Most {{of the time we}} have more chords in a song, because we find it hard writing a great song on just one chord. But if you <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>right,</b> you can make it work, and this song is an example." [...] The track had already been written in 2006. Eriksen and Hermansen played it to their manager, Tyran Smith, who said that it would be perfect for a duet between Shakira and Beyoncé. Eriksen and Hermansen considered this to be impossible, however Smith was devoted to that idea. As they had no lyric or top melody, various writers attempted to finish the song. The first three attempts were not satisfactory, and Smith put Eriksen and Hermansen to work together with Ghost and Dench, who wrote {{a significant part of the}} lyrics and the melody.|$|E

[...] The director also sought to maintain a Western tone as aliens appeared in the film, saying, [...] "It's very easy to just cut the string and then all of a sudden the action starts and you're in Independence Day." [...] Favreau cited the works of John Ford and Sergio Leone as sources of inspiration as well as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Favreau also wanted the science-fiction element to stand on its own, referencing Alien, Predator, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. He said of both genres, [...] "It's about finding the intersection of those two genres [...] [...] [...] If you <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>right,</b> it honors both, and it becomes interesting and clever and a reinvention of two things that people understand the conventions of, instead of just a retread or remake or sequel or reboot of a film you've seen before." ...|$|E

[...] Long-time associate and former Warner Bros. Senior Vice President of Emerging Technology Ethan Kaplan has speculated that shake-ups at the record label influenced the group's decision to disband. The group discussed breaking up for several years, but was encouraged to continue after the lackluster critical and commercial performance of Around the Sun; according to Mills, [...] "We needed to prove, not only to our fans and critics but to ourselves, that we could still make great records." [...] They were also uninterested in the business end of recording as R.E.M. The band members finished their collaboration by assembling the compilation album Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage 1982–2011, which was released in November 2011. The album is the first to collect songs from R.E.M.'s I.R.S. and Warner Bros. tenures, as well as three songs from the group's final studio recordings from post-Collapse into Now sessions. In November, Mills and Stipe did a brief span of promotional appearances in British media, ruling out the option of the group ever reuniting.|$|E

She wore a red catsuit and long black trenchcoat for the performance. The Sun said [...] "Scherzinger stole the show last night" [...] with her display of [...] "live vocals". The judges gave the performance a standing ovation. On The Xtra Factor following the live performances, Louis Walsh and Simon Cowell praised Scherzinger's performance, respectively calling it [...] "one of the best live guest performances we've ever had" [...] and [...] "if you want {{an example of how}} you <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>right...</b> its Nicole. It was focus, performance, vocals...". The Daily Mail followed suit, saying [...] "Scherzinger put on a spectacle for her first live performance, complete with pyrotechnic lighting, full-size cage and a stage full of scantily-clad dancers... The former guest judge brought the house down with her energetic routine". Elena Gorgan of Softpedia agreed to say that Scherzinger wowed the [...] "explosive" [...] performance, earning her a standing ovation from the judges and audience. The following day, she reprised the performance on ITV's breakfast show, Daybreak before heading to London's Westfield Shopping Centre where she appeared on live screens to promote sports brand Reebok.

[...] Teeman praised Clements and Turner, feeling that they [...] "excelled themselves despite the odd strained pause", though noted that in the aftermath of Bradley's fall, [...] "the perils of live TV became apparent", commenting that: [...] "The direction slackened at just the wrong moment, and you were left hoping someone would get to a bit of script to ward off any more bizarre shots of Jack and Max fighting to free themselves from a policeman's soft grip." ...|$|E

40|$|The first, {{and often}} largest, step toward {{internationalization}} of an interactive application is translation of its output messages, prompts, etc. into the desired language. This is typically {{done with a}} ‘‘message catalog’’: the program supplies a key of some kind, which is looked up in the catalog to yield the appropriate translation. While this basic approach is impossible to avoid (given the infeasibility of automated translation), the engineering details matter a great deal. Programmers can cope with almost infinitely messy interfaces if they must (as witness X programming before Tk), but convincing them to use a new interface voluntarily requires ease of use. Ideally, <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> should be easier than <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> wrong. If there are concrete benefits from <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>right,</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> can be slightly harder than <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> wrong. However, messagecatalog facilities are almost always quite a bit harder to use than puts. Hence applications typically use message catalogs only when it is explicitly demanded by the requirements, and retrofitting an application to use a message catalog is painful. A carefully designed message-catalog facility can be almost as easy to use as puts, and retrofitting it into a program can be relatively easy. The lookup key should be the message in the original language. Simple provisions for nested subtranslations, untranslated substrings, disambiguating tags, and either explicit (call a procedure) or implicit (done as part of output) translation are essential. Doing all this for Tcl takes care but is practical...|$|R
