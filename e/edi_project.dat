40|$|This article {{examined}} newly emerging {{patterns of}} agricultural extension {{in the context}} of decentralization policy in Bénin. It assesses whether the promises of decentralization were met {{in the case of the}} ‘Experimental Development on Innovation’ (<b>EDI)</b> <b>project.</b> Thus, it assessed the extent to which service delivery became demand-oriented and effective in promoting production-enhancing technologies for sustainable agriculture. Semi-structured and individual interviews were used to investigate the dynamics and processes through which the project evolved. The analysis of findings showed that after its promising start, the <b>EDI</b> <b>project</b> experienced a number of setbacks, and eventually became intertwined with the supply-oriented service delivery. While it contended successfully with those involved, consideration must be given to the fact that the formal funding and delivery arrangement often contradicted the expectations that services delivery should become ‘demand-oriented’. The article concluded that services delivery depends rather on the negotiation and on the quality of the process in which demand and supply are articulated and matche...|$|E
40|$|Information {{technology}} {{continues to}} play an increasingly {{significant role in the}} development of firms competing in the vast array of markets from those classified as global markets, such as the automotive industry, to the smaller nationally-based markets such as retailing. An objective of electronic commerce is to assist organisations to remain competitive and gain entry to markets which were previously unattainable. This study focuses on the organisational impact of one form of electronic commerce (electronic data interchange) on the component sector of the Australian automotive industry and examines the extent to which trading partner relationships have been affected. The research investigates the extent to which the integration of electronic data interchange (EDI) with an organisation’s internal application system may facilitate specific net benefits. The automotive industry became the first Australian industry to cooperatively adopt EDI. Research to date has not adequately examined the organisational impact of the nature and extent of net benefits gained from EDI adoption. To achieve the objective of assessing EDI net benefits, a conceptual model was developed. The model proposed that the level of EDI net benefits expected is influenced by the size of the organisation and the concentration of trade achieved within the industry via intervening links through (a) the level of senior management commitment and (b) the extent of system integration. Nine empirically testable research propositions are derived from the model, each testing the relationship between model constructs. Data was collected from 114 component suppliers to Ford Australia in 1992 and 1994 using a repeated cross-sectional longitudinal design. Structural equation modelling using partial least squares was adopted in the analysis of the data. A pure longitudinal model together with 12 case studies of selected component manufacturers supplemented the research design. The results of the research showed that the proposed conceptual model is a good description of the data. In particular, net benefits obtained from EDI adoption are directly determined by the size of the organisation, and the extent to which firms integrate EDI into their internal application systems. The level of net benefits is only indirectly influenced by the level of senior management commitment to the <b>EDI</b> <b>project</b> through (a) management commitment’s direct effect on integration, and (b) the direct effect the volume of trade a supplier achieves with the automotive industry on senior management commitment and system integration. The major benefits organisations experienced from EDI were enhanced productivity, clerical staff savings, improved data accuracy, enhanced customer service and reduced administration costs. The research showed that few suppliers gained inventory savings from EDI, a frequently claimed benefit from EDI adoption. Evidence of small improvements in product quality emerged from the results. In summary, this research attempts to make two primary contributions to knowledge, first in providing a method by which net benefits from electronic commerce can be measured within an industry adopting electronic trading, and second, by providing organisations with the knowledge of the specific net benefits organisations could expect from EDI adoption, together with the four major factors affecting these benefits. The research concludes with possible directions for future research, in particular an assessment of the impact of incorporating financial EDI into electronic trading...|$|E

40|$|As {{an element}} of Electronic Commerce (particularly supply chain management), Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) has the {{potential}} to sustain competitive advantage for individual companies, yet the adoption of EDI has been considerably slower than anticipated. One of the major reasons for this slow uptake is the difficulty in justifying the high investment cost of EDI. Very little research has been undertaken into whether EDI is actually cost-effective, despite its adoption cost. This paper presents the result of a cost-benefit analysis into a preEDI system within a Melbourne-based insurance company. The results indicate that <b>EDI</b> <b>projects</b> can be justified and, furthermore, that EDI has the ability to provide real benefits within the insurance industry...|$|R
40|$|The factors {{leading to}} the initial {{adoption}} of an interorganizational system (IOS) are reasonably well understood, {{but this is not}} true of the determinants of the activities performed following that decision. This paper proposes that the motivation to implement a system is the starting point for understanding the implementation process and develops a theory about the relationship between the motivation to implement an IOS system and the types of activities likely to be performed in the project. We then compare predictions against activities actually performed in three electronic data interchange (<b>EDI)</b> <b>projects,</b> and find that the patterns predicted are observed. On this basis, we assert that motivation influenced business decisions regarding which activities to conduct in each project. We finally assess the likely long-run consequences of each organization’s activity pattern, noting that each motivation-based pattern brings with it a number of potential risks and opportunities that need to be managed carefully...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} is to propose and evaluate a methodology for implementing EDI to assist organisations in reaping the anticipated benefits. The research involved the systematic analysis {{of the state of}} the art of EDI and paradigms of methodologies, to define a model for the EDI implementation methodology, and to define criteria for evaluating such a model. The methodology was developed and modelled utilising the software process model, as adopted by Boehm (1988) and later duPlessis and van der Walt (1992), as a framework. Next a synthesis of the assimilated knowledge and brainstorming of project teams involved in <b>EDI</b> pilot <b>projects,</b> was used to systematically develop an EDI implementation methodology. The methodology was evaluated by utilising it in the implementation of EDI between two organisations, Computer Equipment Brokers (PTY) and Marksec (PTY). It was concluded that the methodology was efficient for implementing EDI. ComputingM. Sc. (Information Systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory about}} the relationship between the motivation to implement an interorganizational system and the types of activities likely to be performed in that implementation project. To illustrate this relationship, we describe three <b>EDI</b> implementation <b>projects</b> performed by two companies within the Australian automotive industry. Each project is motivated by different business requirements (survival, incremental process improvement, and process transformation), and each is associated with a different set of subsequent project activities. Our analysis shows that the pattern of activities observed in each case corresponds exactly to the pattern predicted using established theory. On this basis, we assert that motivation not only influenced the range of activities conducted, it also played a role in determining the activities not conducted. We then assess the likely long-term consequences of each organization’s activity pattern, noting that although the activities conducted are a defensible response to the competitive requirements perceived by managers, each motivationbased pattern also brings with it a number of potential risks (and opportunities) that will need to be managed carefully...|$|R
40|$|EDI) {{technologies}} {{can prove}} to be a strong, strategic initiative for many businesses. However, to leverage these potential benefits, organizations must be able to transform ineffective operating procedures and explore alternative implementations of <b>EDI.</b> The <b>project</b> reported here illustrates how a major Fortune 500 corporation was able to meet the challenge of extending their EDI utilization using specific cycle time reduction techniques. Specifically, they identified various means to reduce the cycle time for electronic bill presentment and payment that should result in improved customer service, increased cost savings, and enhanced revenue. Many organizations consider Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) technologies to be a valuable strategic tool. If implemented correctly, EDI can provide significant benefits in managing business partner relationships (Riggins and Mukhopaphyay 1994). Benefits include increased efficiencies of operation, reduced transaction costs, and improved customer satisfaction (Johnson and Vitale 1988). Unfortunately, EDI utilization can also introduce new problems into the organi-zation. Specifically, the requirements associated with paperless processes can {{have a major impact on}} organizational procedures and controls (Scala and McGrath 1993). Furthermore, traditional implementations of EDI using proprietary value-added networks have proven to be quite cost prohibitive for many small to medium sized customers (Williams and Frolick 2001). Nevertheless, organizations continue to focus on extending their use of EDI technologies to achieve competitive advantage. This article reports the results of a join...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: This study {{investigated}} the social-technical view of knowledge management that supported a close social and technology relationship on automotive industry in Australia. It also examined the impacts of legacy EDI groupware technology {{as a mean to}} support knowledge management in providing value creation for an automotive company. The industry viewed legacy EDI groupware as an agent in converting tacit knowledge to explicit knowledge. Approach: It was a descriptive study. In this study, an undertaking explored the implementation of this groupware application, its organizational impact, success factors and success indicators and this using the framework and analysis of legacy EDI groupware, which incorporated the objectives, strategies, success indicators and success factors. The study presented the finding of a case study of an automotive company, who contracted an external website design consultant to implement legacy EDI groupware system on their sites. The report explored the website design consultant company in order to gain an alternate perspective of topics and issues raised by the study. Results: In this study, legacy EDI groupware technology had successfully offered infrastructure to the automotive industry, which supported the acquisition of knowledge and enhanced the environment that supported the creation and management of knowledge artifacts. Conclusion: The choice and use of the legacy <b>EDI</b> groupware <b>project</b> as a means of supporting knowledge management in providing value creation for automotive industry, was because of the belief that this technology was able to provide a strategy for managing and exploiting knowledge. This project also served to help automotive industry in understanding its knowledge asset, i. e., the value of its knowledge and in assessing that the successful application of its knowledge...|$|R
40|$|This {{project has}} two primary {{objectives}}. Both objectives will {{be achieved through}} research of current data and the creation, distribution and analysis of a business forms industry survey. The first objective was {{to draw attention to}} the growing demand for electronic substitutes for traditional printed business forms, and educate the business forms industry about the biggest threat and opportunity of these technologies, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). This was accomplished by outlining the technology and processes of EDI and describing the various benefits of EDI over traditional printed business forms systems. Such educational descriptions and analysis were necessary due to the lack of attention given to the intense growth in electronic substitutes by business forms trade publications and leaders. The second objective was to quantify the level of awareness that exists for EDI throughout the business forms industry, assess the current and future investment in and development of EDI and electronic forms software and systems by the major forms producing companies of the U. S. and identify what level of leadership has been received with regards to combating or investing in these technologies. The answers to these questions represent new information not currently in existence. A survey of business forms producers was necessary to attain much of this information. The educational information predominantly focuses on EDI instead. of the complete range of electronic substitutes for business forms due to the significant effect that this one technology has. A wide range of sources were consulted, from business forms industry reports to EDI promoters to governmental commerce statistics. This extensive literature search confirmed my earliest convictions that there is a lack of leadership and of significant educational information, at least in accessible print, about the threats and opportunities of EDI and other electronic technologies. A survey of 155 randomly selected forms producers from a population of approximately 500, netted 40 respondents. Most respondents were small producers who had experienced increases in both sales and profits in the past year. The survey shows that forms producers claim to have a fair degree of knowledge about EDI, believe that EDI will have a significant affect on the business forms industry, and EDI offers a fair degree of advantage over the traditional business forms system. Most respondents do not, however, monitor their customers use of electronic substitues for business forms. Most respondents do not invest in electronic technologies as a product or service alternative to current business forms. When asked about their desired role in providing such technologies and future participation in an <b>EDI</b> VAN service <b>project,</b> most respondents were favorable to the ideas. When asked if the forms industry leadership had done enough to educate them about electronic technology threats and opportunities, respondents definitely felt neglected and desired more information. The comments respondents wrote on the surveys were interesting but showed a general lack of understanding for what investment in new technologies really entails. Surprisingly, despite the small size of most of the firms responding to the survey and the fact that most had experienced increased profits, most expressed their feelings that they had a good understanding of EDI, EDI had significant advantages over there products and services and they are interested in investing in new technonlogies. In general it is clear, but perhaps not definitively conclusive, that hypotheses 1 and 2 are false and hypotheses 3 and 4 are true. Further questions are probed and answered in the Conclusions section. This report is an excellent pilot study but must be expanded and refined in order to formulate concrete recommendations to aid the industry...|$|R
