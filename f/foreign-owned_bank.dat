40|$|We {{examine whether}} <b>foreign-owned</b> and government-owned <b>banks</b> in Central and Eastern Europe reacted {{differently}} during a domestic systematic banking {{crisis and the}} global financial crisis of 2008. Our panel dataset comprises data on more than 400 banks for the period 1994 - 2010. Our analysis shows that foreign banks provided credit during domestic banking crises in host countries, while government-owned banks contracted. In contrast, <b>foreign-owned</b> <b>banks</b> reduced their credit base during the global financial crisis, while government-owned banks expanded. Consequently, our results show that <b>foreign-owned</b> <b>banks</b> may contribute to financial stability during domestic crisis episodes, but also {{increase the risk of}} importing instability from abroad during a crisis in their home markets. However, government-owned banks may substitute for <b>foreign-owned</b> <b>banks</b> and hinder the transmission of international shocks. Thus, our results indicate that a mixed banking sector consisting of <b>foreign-owned</b> and government-owned <b>banks</b> is most advisable. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the development of}} the banking sector in European transition countries. We find that, although bank assets increased during the 1990 s, credit to the private sector remained relatively low. <b>Foreign-owned</b> <b>banks</b> have become major players in the financial system of these countries. However, foreign bank presence and financial development in general vary considerably among the transition economies. <b>Foreign-owned</b> <b>banks</b> have, in general, higher profitability levels than domestic banks.

S. -owned banks between 1985 and 1990. Their results indicate that <b>foreign-owned</b> <b>banks</b> were significantly less profit efficient than were U. S. -owned banks primarily due to foreign banks reliance on expensive purchased funds. For <b>foreign-owned</b> <b>banks,</b> the results are consistent with a strategy of sacrificing profits in exchange for fast growth and increased market share during the 1980 s.

40|$|The Chinese {{cultural}} factor guanxi (personal relationships) has {{an important}} influence on the implementation and effectiveness of HRM practices in China. However, few studies have investigated how guanxi influences performance appraisal in organisations with different ownership structures. We investigated this issue by studying three banks operating in mainland China: a state-owned bank, a <b>foreign-owned</b> <b>bank</b> and a city commercial bank. Both quantitative (survey of 308 employees) and qualitative data (22 in-depth interviews) were used. Macro-level convergence and micro-level divergence were found among the banks. The reform of the performance appraisal system in the state-owned bank indicated a degree of convergence towards a form commonly found in Western banks, {{at least on the}} surface. However, there were differences at the implementation level in the three banks. The perceived influence of guanxi on performance appraisal was strongest in the state-owned bank and weakest in the <b>foreign-owned</b> <b>bank.</b> The reasons for this included generational differences in cultural values, the international experience of employees and managers, and the degree of alignment between senior managers and others over the purpose of appraisal. The study demonstrates the mutability of cultural characteristics in different organisational settings. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} new measure of {{uncertainty}} derived from bank-level data. We apply the measure of firm-level uncertainty developed by Bloom and others (2012) to banking. Uncertainty is measured as the cross-sectional dispersion of shocks to banking-sector specific variables. We then analyze how uncertainty in banking affects lending by domestic and <b>foreign-owned</b> <b>banks.</b> We find that, first, higher uncertainty in banking has negative effects on bank lending. Second, the effect is heterogeneous across banks: Lending by banks which are better capitalized and have higher liquidity buffers tends to be affected less. Third, <b>foreign-owned</b> <b>banks</b> do not react differently to uncertainty in the host country compared to domestically-owned banks...|$|R

We find publicly-owned Indian banks to have been the most efficient, followed by <b>foreign-owned</b> <b>banks</b> and privately-owned Indian banks. We also f'md a temporal improvement in the performance of <b>foreign-owned</b> <b>banks,</b> virtually no trend in the performance of privately-owned Indian banks, and a temporal decline in the performance ofpublicly-owned Indian banks.

40|$|Banking sector {{globalization}} has caused an expansion in <b>foreign-owned</b> <b>bank</b> assets. In this paper we analyse {{the effects of}} a MNB's liability structure upon its investment in a foreign country. We develop a model in which capital adequacy requirements introduce some deliberate underinvestment which counters deposit insurance-induced overinvestment. Diversification is unattractive with fixed bank capital requirements, because it reduces the expected value of the deposit insurance net. This effect applies in multinational banks (MNBs), where shocks to the home country economy alter the value of the deposit insurance net and hence affect overseas lending incentives. Thus, MNBs act as a channel for financial contagion. We discuss the policy implications of our results. Copyright 2007 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|E
40|$|We use {{an insider}} {{econometrics}} approach {{to analyze the}} impact of modernization of human resource management (HRM) policies on “sales ” of loans and deposits in all branches of a <b>foreign-owned</b> <b>bank</b> in Central-Eastern Europe. Building on {{our knowledge of the}} policy adoption process and the fact that our data comprise the entire population of units eligible for the reforms we present an innovative strategy to identify our econometric model in the presence of endogeneity in the implementation of reforms – a major issue in insider econometrics. The reforms comprise the introduction of a new functional structure with differentiated incentives across functions. We conclude that the reforms have been successful in raising the average sales productivity of branch employees, although there are some caveats. In particular, we find that the reforms have had mixed benefits for the quality of sales in terms of product mix and profitability. While the bank has avoided a deterioration of loan-quality, our results underscore the risks of quantity-based incentives where quality is important as well as the problems associated with differentiation in incentives among co-workers...|$|E
40|$|The {{market share}} of U. S. {{business}} loans made by foreign-owned banks has increased dramatically since 1980. At the same time, foreign direct investment in the U. S. rose, so {{that much of the}} increase in foreign-owned U. S. -based bank lending to businesses in the U. S. could conceivably be accounted for by an increase in loans to the U. S. affiliates of firms headquartered abroad, an expectation in line with the conventional wisdom that bans "follow their customers" abroad. Our study investigates the lending patterns of U. S. -based banks from Japan, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the U. K., countries which account {{for the vast majority of}} <b>foreign-owned</b> <b>bank</b> activity in the U. S. Simultaneously, we look at the borrowing patterns of U. S. nonbank affiliates of firms from those countries. We find that banks from four of the six countries (Japan, Canada, the Netherlands, and the U. K.) allocated a majority of their loans to non-home country borrowers, for some or all of the 1981 - 92 period. That result suggests that the "follow the customer" hypothesis may have a more limited applicability than previously supposed. Banking market; Banks and banking; Banks and banking, Foreign...|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{foreign banks}} own the banks that hold about 80 {{percent of the}} assets in Mexican banks. The paper argues {{that this is the}} third {{instance}} in which <b>foreign-owned</b> <b>banks</b> have initially comprised {{a large part of the}} Mexican banking system, and that in the first two cases (1865 - 1910 and 1920 - 1935), the degree of foreign ownership will recede. The argument is that reform and competition among the banks will cause the conditions that attracted the foreign banks to erode and the domestic banks to be able to grow more rapidly. Therefore, in subsequent decades many foreigner owners are likely to sell their subsidiaries to local banks and investors. Thus over time the ratio of assets in <b>foreign-owned</b> <b>banks</b> to total banking system assets should decline, even in the absence of government policies that aim for that result. ...|$|R

A comparison of the behavior of major domestic banks with a peer group of <b>foreign-owned</b> <b>banks</b> showed how the large domestic banks reacted to competitive pressures. In particular, the study focused on the volatility and substitution of interest and noninterest profits in the two peer groups. The testing of the convergence in these variables confirmes a different pattern of behavior.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how bank ownership influenced the credit supply {{during the recent}} financial crisis in Russia, where the banking sector consists of a mix of state-controlled <b>banks,</b> <b>foreign-owned</b> <b>banks,</b> and domestic private banks. To estimate credit supply changes, we employ an exhaustive dataset for Russian banks that covers the crisis period and apply an original approach based on stochastic frontier analysis. Our findings suggest bank ownership affected credit supply during the financial crisis and that the crisis led to an overall decrease in the credit supply. Relative to domestic private <b>banks</b> <b>foreign-owned</b> <b>banks</b> reduced their credit supply more and state-controlled banks less. This supports the hypothesis that foreign banks have a “lack of loyalty” to domestic actors during a crisis, {{as well as the}} view that an objective function of state-controlled banks leads them to support the economy during economic downturns. bank; credit policy; foreign ownership; state ownership; stochastic frontier analysis...|$|R
