2500|$|At {{least two}} Penn State trustees, {{as well as}} several alumni, criticized Erickson for {{accepting}} the NCAA sanctions as quickly as he had. [...] However, in a press conference of his own shortly after the penalties were handed down, Erickson said that as harsh as they were, {{he had no choice but}} to accept them. [...] According to Erickson, had Penn State not accepted the penalties, the NCAA would have gone in [...] "another direction"—one that would have included the NCAA canceling at least the 2012 season. [...] Erickson said that under the circumstances, [...] "we had our backs to the wall," [...] and he had no choice but to accept the consent decree since it was the only deal on offer. [...] Erickson subsequently told ESPN's John Barr that Penn State was facing as long as a four-year ban from play had it not agreed to the sanctions that were ultimately imposed. [...] Erickson went further on July 25, saying that Emmert had personally told him on July 17—a day after Emmert's interview with Smiley—that a majority of the NCAA leadership wanted to shut down Penn State football for four years. [...] He also said that Penn State could have faced a host of other severe penalties, including a fine several times greater than the $60 million ultimately imposed. [...] When Erickson learned this, he immediately started talks with the NCAA, and was able to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> taken off the table. Erickson discussed his actions with the board later that night, and the board resolved that Erickson's actions were understandable under the circumstances.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> {{has been}} an issue of debate for decades and it is of great {{relevance}} at present. Different reasons have emerged that make recourse to <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> appear necessary, such as, that {{it serves as a}} deterrent, it meets the need for retribution and that public opinion demands its imposition. Conversely, more convincing arguments have been raised for its abolition, amongst which is the argument that it is a violation of human rights. Africa is seen as one of the “death penalty regions” in the world, as most African states still retain <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> despite <b>the</b> growing international human rights standards and trends towards its abolition. Further, the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights makes no mention of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b> <b>The</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in Africa is therefore an issue that one has to be particularly concerned about. During the 36 th Ordinary Session (2004) of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, for the first time, <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> was one of the issues discussed by the Commission. Commissioner Chirwa initiated debate about the abolition of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in Africa, urging the Commission to take a clear position on the subject. In view of this and the international human rights developments and trends on <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty,</b> discourses on <b>the</b> abolition of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in Africa are much needed. Accordingly, this study examines <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in Africa from a human rights perspective. It seeks to determine why African states retain <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty,</b> <b>the</b> ways in which the current operation of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in African states conflicts with human rights, what causes obstructions to its abolition in Africa, and whether it is appropriate for African states to join the international trend for the abolition of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b> <b>The</b> current status and operation of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in Africa is first examined. The historical background to <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in Africa from a traditional and western perspective is also discussed. Subsequently, the main arguments advanced by Africans (including African leaders, writers, priests and government officials) for the retention of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in Africa are evaluated. The study goes further to examine <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in African states {{in the light of the}} right to life, the prohibition of cruel inhuman and degrading treatment and fair trial rights at both the international and national levels. After examining <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in African states, the study arrives at the conclusion that it is appropriate for African states to join the international trend for the abolition of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty,</b> considering that <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in Africa conflicts with human rights, the justifications for its retention are fundamentally flawed, and that alternatives to <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in Africa exist.
