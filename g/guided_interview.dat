40|$|Aim: To {{produce a}} {{framework}} {{for the development of}} a qualitative semi-structured <b>interview</b> <b>guide.</b> Background: Rigorous data collection procedures fundamentally influence the results of studies. The semi-structured interview is a common data collection method, but methodological research on the development of a semi-structured <b>interview</b> <b>guide</b> is sparse. Design: Systematic methodological review. Data Sources: We searched PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science for methodological papers on semi-structured <b>interview</b> <b>guides</b> from October 2004 - September 2014. Having examined 2, 703 titles and abstracts and 21 full texts, we finally selected ten papers. Review methods: We analysed the data using the qualitative content analysis method. Results: Our analysis resulted in new synthesized knowledge on the development of a semistructured <b>interview</b> <b>guide,</b> including five phases: 1) identifying the prerequisites for using semi-structured interviews; 2) retrieving and using previous knowledge; 3) formulating the preliminary semi-structured interview guide; 4) pilot testing the guide; and 5) presenting the complete semi-structured <b>interview</b> <b>guide.</b> Conclusion: Rigorous development of a qualitative semi-structured <b>interview</b> <b>guide</b> contributes to the objectivity and trustworthiness of studies and makes the results more plausible.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the {{purchase}} of children's and young people's literature in public libraries in Austria, namely which sources librarians use for the selection of children's and young people's literature and which factors they take into consideration when selecting a book. The research methods have taken a combined approach that has included both quantitative and qualitative research methods. The quantitative data are collected by sending out an email-based questionnaire. First, the questionnaires are analysed, which then {{formed the basis for}} the <b>guided</b> <b>interview.</b> Afterwards, a <b>guided</b> <b>interview</b> with the librarians of the libraries in question was carried out to collect information about the purchase of children's and young people's literature. In conclusion, {{it was found that the}} purchase of children's and young people's literature is based mainly on assumed interests of the readers and not on pedagogical, literary, nor educational aspects. The analysis of the questionnaire showed that there is a link between the proportion of children’s and young people’s literature and the size of the library. It was found that mass media, for example radio and TV are seldomly used for selecting children’s and young people’s literature, while lists of recommendations, professional journals and recommendations on advanced training are often used as selection sources...|$|E
