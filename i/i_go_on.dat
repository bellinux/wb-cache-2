500|$|In 2009, {{opposite}} Sacha Parkinson, {{who plays}} Sian Powers, Thompson filmed his first screen kiss. He {{said of the}} experience, [...] "It was bizarre because Sacha had done one before and I hadn't. I knew the line I had to say and then kiss her. I knew it every time, and every time I said it I was shaking." [...] He continued, [...] "Oh it was dreadful. I mean I don't get nervous when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> stage or anything like that, {{but it was just}} bizarre. It {{was one of those things}} that I got really nervous about." [...] The on-screen romance was part of a controversial New Year's Eve storyline which featured the two characters attempting to see in 2010 by losing their virginities, only to be discovered by Ryan's adoptive mother Michelle. In May 2012, it was confirmed that Ryan would be recast and played by Sol Heras, because Thompson chose not to return.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} how he comes up with song titles, McKinnon said: [...] "I've got my iPhone, and <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> my notes and every time I see {{something}} I like I write it down, {{so a lot of}} the time titles are something that mean something to us only, or to someone I know only." [...] He called What Separates Me from You [...] "the slowest for stuff like that", when referring to song titles. Westfall said that the album's title and the songs' subjects were about [...] "Separating your self from your peers and really coming into your own." [...] McKinnon said What Separates Me from You was [...] "a lot more personal and darker" [...] than Homesick, and that it was [...] "a natural progression of what we were doing" [...] with [...] "the same core" [...] as the band's preceding albums. Asked whether the album reached new heights, he said it [...] "was definitely the next step" [...] for the band. However, the band originally had no idea on how the album would turn out: [...] "It was a little bit all over the place, because of me coming in, Tom [...] leaving and all this new stuff that was going on", as stated by guitarist Kevin Skaff. Skaff said that McKinnon originally really wanted to name the album Always the Hard Way, but later realized that the hardcore band Terror had already used that title for an album.|$|E
500|$|For her {{portrayal}} of Valene, Van Ark received two Soap Opera Digest awards {{in the category}} [...] "Outstanding Actress in a Leading Role on a Prime Time Serial". Greg Hernandez said, [...] "Before <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on,</b> I have to confess that I was a die-hard fan of Knots Landing, the series on which Joan played sweet Valene Ewing for 14 years. Her character of Valene was a best-selling author but her personal life was always a mess. She had her husband, Gary, stolen by another woman then got pregnant by him, her twin babies were kidnapped by a crooked doctor, she was given a drug overdose at gunpoint by her ex-husband's fiancee, and she racked up enough marriages to give Elizabeth Taylor a run for her money. But she and Gary Ewing (Ted Shackleford) made for one of television's most beloved couples and the audience never stopped rooting {{for them to get}} back together. Joan keeps in touch with Ted (pictured with Joan, above at a [...] "Knots" [...] reunion a few years back), Michelle Lee - who played her best friend Karen - and the great stage star Julie Harris who played her mother." [...] Knots Landing itself has experienced a tremendous fan following and dedication. Van Ark said of this, [...] "It’s amazing. It’s like having friends everywhere in the United States. I heard that a group a fans from London were coming in just to see us at this (autograph convention). We get a lot of fan mail from Europe – France, Germany, Russia. Knots has a huge following, and I think fans of the show are loving and loyal. Not many shows last 14 years on prime-time. That’s a milestone, and I’m very proud of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Osbourne has abused {{alcohol and}} other drugs {{for most of his}} adult life. He {{admitted}} to Sounds in 1978, [...] "I get high, I get fucked up ... what the hell's wrong with getting fucked up? There must be something wrong with the system if so many people have to get fucked up ... I never take dope or anything before <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> stage. I'll smoke a joint or whatever afterwards." [...] Black Sabbath bandmate Tony Iommi said that, while all the band were involved with {{alcohol and other}} drugs to various degrees in the 1970s, Osbourne had the unhealthiest lifestyle of them all. Despite this, said Iommi, he was typically the only one left standing when the others were [...] "out for the count". Keyboardist Don Airey said that Osbourne's substance-abuse issues were what caused him to leave the band.|$|E
2500|$|While {{composing}} Rebel Heart, Madonna {{would get}} [...] "fleeting moments of ideas" [...] {{of what she}} would like to perform on the tour. After the promotional performances supporting the album, she had a concrete imagery about the themes {{she would like to}} incorporate. [...] "I like to create personas and then the persona changes and grows into other things... I'm at the beginning of that process right now, in terms of thinking of my tour and stuff," [...] the singer explained. Rehearsals for the tour occurred for 10–12 hours per day. She added: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> tour, I like the rehearsal. I like the creation of everything. I like being able to wear my rehearsal clothes and be sweaty and not having to worry about how I look and just get into what it is I'm trying to say and do." [...] Unlike The MDNA Tour, Madonna confirmed that her son Rocco would not perform onstage, but would instead work behind the scenes of Rebel Heart Tour.|$|E

2500|$|Following a ratings success, What Not to Wear was {{promoted}} to BBC One in 2004 to air its fourth series. The format was changed slightly, where a 30-minute show with one makeover {{was replaced by a}} 60-minute show featuring two makeovers. The series that aired {{for the first time on}} BBC One began on 29 September 2004, and had success with viewing figures which peaked at 5.26 million during the episode aired on 20 October 2004. For a Christmas special aired on 22 December 2004, Trisha Goddard was madeover by Constantine and Woodall, where the episode generated 7.42 million viewers. Other What Not to Wear specials saw them giving David Baddiel and Ingrid Tarrant makeovers. Tarrant, however, did not wear what Constantine and Woodall had selected, and changed her dress in the back of the taxi whilst driving to the award ceremony. The fifth series began on 19 October 2005, where viewing figures still remained strong. On 16 November and 23, 2005 ratings reached 4.91 million and the series averaged with 4.8 million viewers. In 2005, Britney Spears revealed that she was a fan of the show when she commented [...] "The girls are so dramatic in the makeovers, you just get caught up in it. Would <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the show? Never say never.?" ...|$|E

"He (Steve) became {{another person}} {{to cope with}} the pressures, he would say things like, [...] "Please tell me that you'll leave me if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> tour again because if you say that I’ll have {{justification}} not to go, if I go and have to be that other person again I'll just go mad." [...] This would be said in a moment of truth but the next day had changed his mind and he'd be up and off.... He was married to his music and I didn't mind that especially in the early years when he would play me new songs on an acoustic guitar but what didn't make me happy was {{when he was in the}} home studio, out of his brain, trying to come up with the next album because he was being pressurised into it. He would just disappear into the studio for three or four days at a time. He never slept and there would be all sorts of strange people in there with him. It was a crazy business and even the nicest people get mixed up. All sorts of chemicals were presented to him and he became addicted to them in the end. It was drugs that destroyed our relationship. Before the home studio was built Beehive Cottage was our sanctuary, afterwards it just became his workplace." [...] – Jenny Rylance ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his {{childhood}} in Barcelona, Carreras's father, Josep Carreras i Soler, worked as a traffic policeman. He had originally been a French teacher. However, he had fought on the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War, and when the Franco government came into power in 1939, {{he was no longer}} allowed to teach. His mother, Antonia Coll i Saigi, ran a small hair-dressing salon, where, as a child, Carreras often sang to the customers in return for pocket money. He was very close to his mother, who was convinced that he would one day be a great singer, and her death from cancer when he was 18 affected him greatly. In José Carreras: A Life Story, he said that [...] "even now, every time <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> stage, I always, always, have a quick thought for her." [...] In 1971 Carreras married Mercedes Pérez. They had two children: a son, Albert (born in 1972), and a daughter, Julia (born in 1978). The marriage ended in divorce in 1992. In 2006, Carreras married Jutta Jäger, but separated from her in 2011. Carreras's nephew, David Giménez Carreras, is a conductor and Director of the Orquestra Simfònica del Vallès. He has conducted [...] many of Carreras's concerts since the late 1990s as well as his opera performances in Sly at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in June 2000.|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with the Associated Press, Knowles said that one of the hardest parts of the tour was [...] "squeezing a decade's worth of hits into a two-hour show" [...] and performing the songs in designer Thierry Mugler's [...] "elaborate" [...] costumes. She elaborated: [...] "I'm never gonna go onstage or do a video and not work until my feet are blistered, and until I'm basically, I can't walk any more. I always give, and I do that because I know how lucky I am, to do my job." [...] She also promised that the tour would be more emotional than The Beyoncé Experience because of the [...] "real raw and more sensitive" [...] nature of the I Am... portion of the double album. Knowles also expressed frustration that snippets of the show appeared online after the first shows on the opening leg, [...] "ruining" [...] some of the surprise of the concert experience and possibly convincing some fans not to attend. She went on saying: [...] "It's great because people can get a little sneak peek and say, 'Oh, I wanna come to the show,' or, 'I don't wanna go to that show'... and I'm fans of people so <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> there and check it out too. But you put so much of your heart and time into the wardrobe... it's kind of unfortunate that people can see the show months before you get into their city, but that's life." [...] French designer Thierry Mugler collaborated with Knowles on the wardrobe and had a creative advisor role, as he also contributed to designing the whole show, from lighting to choreography, production and directing three sequences for the concert. As a creative advisor, Mugler stated about the show: ...|$|E
2500|$|Reed said that, of his roles, he {{probably}} loved Ko-Ko the most, noting, [...] "t's such {{fun to do}} ... you make people laugh, and the children and everybody enjoy him. And I suppose that's what our job is here anyway. To entertain people." [...] He also commented, [...] "Ko-Ko is almost me. There's a lot of me in the character. It lets me bring out my sense of humour. ... the character parts ... you must get your own personality through." [...] On the other hand, he said, [...] "Something takes over from me when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>on.</b> I become something different. I'm basically shy, and I go and hide behind my characters." [...] Reed also loved to play Jack Point in Yeomen, a tragicomic character. [...] "Jack Point is me in another age – just a strolling player. I really believe I could die of a broken heart". Reed said that every comedian savours {{the chance to play}} a role like Point in which [...] "you like to see if you can make 'em cry a little". He also noted that, generally, [...] "I like anything where the dancing comes in". His least favourite role was Major-General Stanley in Pirates, a role that he relinquished in 1969. He also found two drawbacks to playing King Gama: [...] "the heavy make-up ... hid every feature of his face except his eyes, and made it impossible for him to wear his glasses so that he could do his newspaper crossword while waiting to go on". Of the [...] "younger" [...] roles he played even in his later years with the company, Reed said, [...] "I feel I'm so fundamentally a young person. ... I'm older than the part I'm playing, for instance, but I feel young." [...] He loved performing for children and delighted in the gala [...] "last nights" [...] of each London season with the D'Oyly Carte, where he would perform for glittering audiences of [...] "Prime Ministers, Lord Chancellors and First Lords of the Admiralty." ...|$|E
