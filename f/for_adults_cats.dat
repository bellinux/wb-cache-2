40|$|The {{percentage}} of <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> euthanized in animal shelters {{is greater than}} that of kittens because <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> {{are less likely to be}} adopted. This study aimed to provide evidence to inform the design of strategies to encourage <b>adult</b> <b>cat</b> adoptions. One such strategy is to discount adoption prices, but there are concerns that this may result in poor adoption outcomes. We surveyed 382 cat adopters at the time of adoption, to assess potential determinants of adopters’ cat age group choice (adult or kitten) and, <b>for</b> <b>adult</b> <b>cat</b> adopters, the price they are willing to pay. The same respondents were surveyed again 6 – 12 months after the adoption to compare outcomes between cat age groups and between <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> in two price categories. Most adopters had benevolent motivations for adopting from the shelter and had put considerable thought into the adoption and requirements for responsible ownership. However, <b>adult</b> <b>cat</b> adopters were more likely to have been influenced by price than kitten adopters. Adoption outcomes were generally positive <b>for</b> both <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> and kittens and <b>for</b> <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> adopted at low prices. The latter finding alleviates concerns about the outcomes of “low-cost” adoptions in populations, such as the study population, and lends support for the use of “low-cost” adoptions as an option for attempting to increase adoption rates. In addition, the results provide information that can be used to inform future campaigns aimed at increasing the number of <b>adult</b> <b>cat</b> adoptions, particularly in devising marketing strategies <b>for</b> <b>adult</b> <b>cats...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{nutritional}} value of meat meal (MM), chicken meal (CM), and corn gluten meal (CGM) as dietary sources of protein in dry food formulated <b>for</b> <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> was evaluated. Twelve healthy <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> (11 males and 1 female) were used. Dry diets containing MM, CM, or CGM {{as the main}} protein source were given for a 3 -week period in a 3 × 3 Latin-square design. Digestion and balance experiments were conducted during the last 7 d of each period. In addition, freshly voided urine was taken to determine urinary pH and number of struvite crystals. As compared with the CM diet, dry-matter digestibility was higher and lower for the MM and CGM groups, respectively.

40|$|The {{additive}} Lenziaren is a polynuclear Fe(III) starch/saccharose complex {{intended to}} be used in food <b>for</b> <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> to reduce phosphate absorption in the gastrointestinal tract in order to prevent chronic kidney disease. The recommended minimum and maximum levels are 0. 25 g and 1. 0 g per cat per day, equivalent to 5   000 and 20   000 mg/kg feed, respectively. The FEEDAP Panel considers that Lenziaren is safe <b>for</b> <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> at the maximum recommended dose. However, the consequences of chronic exposure have not been investigated. The additive is not genotoxic. No adverse effects were seen in a repeat-dose toxicity study in mice. Lenziaren had no adverse effects on reproduction and development at dose levels that were not toxic to the mother. A no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 500 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day was identified for Lenziaren on the basis of maternal toxicity (diarrhoea and reduced body weight gain), which was seen in rabbits at an oral dose of 1   000 mg/kg bw per day or greater. Similar effects were seen in rats, dogs and monkeys at higher doses in repeat-dose toxicity studies. No NOAELs were identified in these studies. Lenziaren is not regarded as an irritant to skin or eyes or as a skin sensitiser. Although some inhalation exposure is possible, it is not expected to be harmful to those exposed as a result of handling the additive. Based on the results of three in vivo efficacy studies, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that Lenziaren {{has the potential to be}} efficacious in cats at the highest recommended dose of 1 g/cat per day (equivalent to 20   000 mg/kg feed). However, the FEEDAP Panel has some reservations regarding the value of its long-term use in healthy cats. The Panel concludes that there is a need for a post-market monitoring plan...|$|R

40|$|Cats {{are popular}} {{companion}} animals, particularly in Europe and North America, and appear in correspondingly large numbers in animal shelters. Temperament tests are not widely {{used to assess}} cats before adoption from shelters. However, cats exhibit {{a wide range of}} temperaments as do the families adopting them and ensuring compatibility between the two could increase the rate of successful placement. Scores on a feline temperament profile (FTP), which measures a cat&# 39;s responses to standardized interactions with an unfamiliar person, were compared between cats and over time and related to responses of cats to familiar and unfamiliar persons and to basal salivary cortisol levels. Cats showed significant differences in FTP scores (p 0. 05), though there were significant differences in cortisol levels between cats (p= 0. 04). The data indicate that the FTP was relatively stable over time <b>for</b> <b>adult</b> <b>cats,</b> and test scores correlated well with ethological observations of cats&# 39; interactions with humans the FTP could provide an accurate, consistent assessment of cat temperament, leading to more successful placement of cats. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to monitor the development of inhibitory interactions elicited in the cat visual system by oriented visual stimuli. Steady-state visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded from the scalp of 11 behaving and alert kittens while they viewed contrast-reversed sinusoidal gratings. In <b>adult</b> <b>cats,</b> the form of VEP contrast-response curves (the amplitude of second harmonic modulation as a function of stimulus contrast) was modified by superimposing a mask grating on the test. Parallel masks displaced the curves to a higher contrast region (probably via contrast gain-control mechanisms), increasing contrast threshold without affecting the slope of the curve. Orthogonal gratings, on the other hand, decrease the slope of the curve without affecting threshold (so called cross-orientation inhibition: Morrone et al., 1981). These effects are similar to those previously reported in human VEPs (Morrone & Burr, 1986; Burr & Morrone, 1987) and single cortical cat cells (Morrone et al., 1982). For young kittens of 20 days, the orthogonal mask had no effect whatsoever on the response curves, and the effect of the parallel mask was much less than <b>for</b> <b>adult</b> <b>cats.</b> At about 40 days, the orthogonal mask began to attenuate responses multiplicatively, and by 50 days the amount of multiplicative attenuation had reached adult levels. The effect of the parallel mask (as indicated by the increase in threshold elevation) increased gradually from 20 - 50 days.

40|$|The first aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether vitamin D supplementation influenced the effects of high vitamin A intake on new bone formation in <b>adult</b> <b>cats.</b> The second aim was to determine whether high vitamin A intake in cats caused liver pathology and, if so, whether the current upper limit for the dietary intake of vitamin A <b>for</b> healthy <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> would be safe. Twenty-four healthy <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> were divided into four groups that received a control diet supplemented with peanut oil (control), or peanut oil containing a 100 -fold increase in vitamin A (HA), or a 100 -fold increase in vitamin A and a fivefold increase in vitamin D (HAMD), or a 100 -fold increase in vitamin A and a 65 -fold increase in vitamin D (HAHD) over a period of 18 months. Cats did not show abnormal locomotion or clinical signs of liver failure after 18 months of supplementation but did show subtle skeletal changes and liver pathology, suggesting that the current National Research Council (2006) safe upper limit for vitamin A for cats is too high. The addition of vitamin D did not seem to influence bone pathology. While moderately elevated dietary vitamin D levels (HAMD) seemed to protect cats against the liver pathology caused by the consumption of large amounts of vitamin A, higher dietary levels of vitamin D (HAHD) did not seem to be protective...|$|R
40|$|The act of {{micturition}} differs strongly among species. <b>For</b> example, <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> {{and humans}} urinate primarily {{in a safe}} environment (`guarded urination'), while rats urinate more reflexively (`reflex urination'). This study in adult rats investigates the existence of direct lumbosacral cord projections to spinally projecting neurons in the pontine micturition center (PMC). Bilateral injections of wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase in the caudal lumbar and rostral sacral cord resulted in labeled profiles, including retrogradely labeled neurons in the PMC. At the ultrastructural level, anterogradely labeled terminals in the PMC were found, which were filled with many round and some pleiomorphic and flat vesicles. About eleven percent of the terminals contacted retrogradely labeled dendrites. Of the labeled terminals 80 % contained asymmetric synaptic clefts, and 20 % symmetric synaptic clefts. The results provide evidence that in the rat, unlike the cat, a direct lumbosacral pathway to the PMC exists, which might explain the differences in micturition behavior between rats and cats. ...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to provide information for the determination of the protein and amino acid requirements of the <b>adult</b> domestic <b>cat</b> by the factorial method. Data are presented on four factors for a factorial model: (1) the endogenous amino acids excreted in the faeces, (2) the amino acids which are required for the replacement of hair, (3) the body amino acids which are catabolised and ultimately voided in the urine and (4) the excretion of the urinary amino acid felinine. Endogenous ileal nitrogen and amino acid excretions were determined under the conditions of protein-free and peptide (enzymatically hydrolysed casein, molecular weight 0. 05) effect of hair colour on the amino acid composition of cat hair. Amino acid nitrogen accounted for 94 and 99 % of the total nitrogen when determined by conventional 24 h hydrolysis and the compartmental model, respectively. The accurate amino acid composition of cat hair is presented. Endogenous urinary excretions of total, urea, ammonia and creatinine nitrogen in the <b>adult</b> <b>cat</b> were determined by feeding cats a protein-free diet or by regression to zero protein intake of urinary nitrogen metabolite excretions <b>for</b> <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> fed four levels of dietary protein. The mean (± SEM) endogenous total, urea and ammonia nitrogen excretions for the cats fed the protein-free diet were 360 (± 11. 3), 243 (± 8. 8) and 27. 6 (± 1. 06) mg·kg- 0. 75 body weight·d- 1, respectively. Lower mean (± SEM) estimates of 316 (± 53. 9) and 232 (± 43. 4) mg·kg- 0. 75 body weight·d- 1 were obtained for the endogenous excretions of total and urea nitrogen, respectively using the regression technique while a higher endogenous urinary ammonia nitrogen excretion of 33. 7 (± 5. 68) mg·kg- 0. 75 body weight·d- 1 was found. The differences between the two techniques were not statistically significant. Daily excretions of creatinine nitrogen were not significantly (P = 0. 64) different (mean ± SEM, 16. 2 ± 0. 46 and 17. 5 ± 1. 19 mg·kg- 0. 67 body weight, respectively) for the two methods. The chemical body composition of male and female <b>adult</b> <b>cats</b> was determined to obtain an estimate of the pattern of endogenous amino acid catabolism. Dehaired empty cat bodies were subjected to analysis for dry matter, lipid, ash, crude protein, amino acids, and several minerals (Ca, P, K, Mg, Fe, Mn and Zn). The chemical body composition was found to be similar between male and female cats except for the amount of crude protein which was significantly (P 0. 05) effect of gender on the whole body amino acid composition (lipid-free dry matter or mol % basis) except for cysteine which was significantly (P < 0. 05) lower in the male cats in comparison to the female cats. A review on the urinary amino acid, felinine, which can be found in cat urine is presented. The biological significance of felinine to the animal is still a matter for speculation, but its function as a precursor to a pheromone seems likely. To obtain a standard for quantification experiments, several published synthesis procedures reported leading to (±) -felinine were evaluated for their yield. Most of the procedures were found to produce an amino acid isomeric with felinine. The yield for the only evaluated synthesis procedure shown to produce felinine was found to be low. A new higher yielding method for the synthesis of (±) -felinine is presented. In a separate study, normal urinary excretions of felinine by entire male, castrated male, entire female and spayed female cats were determined and were found to be (mean ± SEM) 122 ± 23. 6, 41 ± 8. 4, 36 ± 7. 3 and 20 ± 3. 8 µmol·kg- 1 body weight·d- 1, respectively...|$|R

RESULTS: NGF, BDNF, NT- 3 and their mRNA were observed in some satellite cells. The positive signal of mRNA for NGF, BDNF and NT- 3 was observed in cytoplasm. However, there was difference in the subcellular localization of protein for the three factors.
