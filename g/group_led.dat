5|$|A {{resistance}} movement soon emerged. On 22 June 1941, the 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment was formed near Sisak, {{as the first}} military unit formed by a {{resistance movement}} in occupied Europe. This sparked {{the beginning of the}} Yugoslav Partisan movement, a communist multi-ethnic anti-fascist resistance <b>group</b> <b>led</b> by Josip Broz Tito. The movement grew rapidly and at the Tehran Conference in December 1943 the Partisans gained recognition from the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} Spanish missions, pueblos (towns), presidios (forts), and ranchos {{along the coast}} of California, no Spanish explorers visited the Sierra Nevada.

5|$|In March 1944, Wu {{joined the}} Manhattan Project's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories at Columbia University. She lived in {{dormitory}} there, returning to Princeton on the weekends. The {{role of the}} SAM Laboratories, headed by Harold Urey, was to support the Manhattan Project's gaseous diffusion (K-25) program for uranium enrichment. Wu worked alongside James Rainwater in a <b>group</b> <b>led</b> by William W. Havens, Jr., whose task was to develop radiation detector instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{substantially}} more reactive P(III) derivatives of nucleosides, 3'-O-chlorophosphites, were successfully {{used for the}} formation of internucleosidic linkages. This led to the discovery of the phosphite triester methodology. The <b>group</b> <b>led</b> by M. Caruthers took the advantage of less aggressive and more selective 1H-tetrazolidophosphites and implemented the method on solid phase. Very shortly after, the workers from the same group further improved the method by using more stable nucleoside phosphoramidites as building blocks. The use of 2-cyanoethyl phosphite-protecting group in place of a less user-friendly methyl <b>group</b> <b>led</b> to the nucleoside phosphoramidites currently used in oligonucleotide synthesis (see Phosphoramidite building blocks below). Many later improvements to the manufacturing of building blocks, oligonucleotide synthesizers, and synthetic protocols made the phosphoramidite chemistry a very reliable and expedient method of choice for the preparation of synthetic oligonucleotides.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} that enzymes could be crystallized eventually allowed their structures {{to be solved}} by x-ray crystallography. This was first done for lysozyme, an enzyme found in tears, saliva and egg whites that digests the coating of some bacteria; the structure was solved by a <b>group</b> <b>led</b> by David Chilton Phillips and published in 1965. This high-resolution structure of lysozyme {{marked the beginning of}} the field of structural biology and the effort to understand how enzymes work at an atomic level of detail.|$|E
5|$|The first {{fighting}} between US troops and Yavapai came in early 1837, when the Tolkepaya joined with their Quechan neighbors {{to defend against}} Major Samuel Heintzelman over a Quechan ferry crossing on the Colorado River. The Quechan used the ferry to transport settlers over the river, into California. After they killed a <b>group</b> <b>led</b> by John Glanton, who {{had taken over the}} crossing, the US government retaliated by burning the fields of the Quechans, and taking control of the crossing.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} {{currently}} regarded as monotypic. Three varieties of Ficus obliqua were recognised until 2001—F. obliqua var. petiolaris, F. obliqua var. obliqua, and F. obliqua var. puberula from Western Australia. A {{revision of the}} <b>group</b> <b>led</b> {{to the conclusion that}} F. obliqua var. petiolaris belonged in the species F. rubiginosa. F. obliqua var. puberula was found to be more distantly related to obliqua than rubiginosa and hence has been reclassified as a separate species, Ficus brachypoda.|$|E
5|$|A fragmentary molar, {{preserving}} two cusps, {{is identified}} as from a multituberculate. Although multituberculates are common in nearly contemporaneous deposits in Laurasia, this tooth {{is one of the}} few records from Gondwana; a few fragmentary remains, the multituberculate affinities of some of which are disputed, are also known from South America (Argentodites), Africa (Hahnodon), and Australia (Corriebaatar). Another fragmentary tooth, UA 8699, is recognizable as a tribosphenic lower molar. Krause identified it in 2001 as a marsupial, but in 2003 a <b>group</b> <b>led</b> by Alexander Averianov instead argued that the tooth was placental and related to zhelestids (a primitive group possibly related to ungulates). Both placentals and marsupials are mostly known from Laurasia during the Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of the first Guilty Gear {{released}} on May 14, 1998 for PlayStation, Sammy Studios commissioned an arcade sequel in February 1999. Developed by Team Neo Blood, an Arc System Works production <b>group</b> <b>led</b> by Daisuke Ishiwatari, the sequel was about two years in development. Unveiled at the Amusement Expo in February 2000, Guilty Gear X was released for Japanese arcades on the Sega NAOMI system in July 2000. After the game's release, it was speculated that it would be ported to home consoles. Although the developers initially indicated that Guilty Gear X would debut for the PlayStation 2 (PS2), it was first released for Dreamcast on December 14, 2000 and re-released as part of a Dreamcast collection on May 23, 2003.|$|E

The script {{was written by}} Ryo Akagi, based on a story created by Masato Kato, and the music was composed by a <b>group</b> <b>led</b> by Kenji Ito. The game was a moderate commercial success: it sold 229,000 copies in its first ten days of release in Japan, and over 410,000 copies worldwide {{by the end of}} 2008. While critics praised the graphics and music as beautiful and lush, they found the leveling system annoying, the combat controls difficult and frustrating, and the story trite.|$|E

Thomas Rivera Schatz, President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, asked voters to participate of the referendum and encouraged them to vote {{in favor of}} the amendments. Also, a group of chiefs of agencies made statements {{in favor of the}} amendments. The <b>group,</b> <b>led</b> by Chief of Staff Miguel Romero, included Guillermo Somoza (Justice), Yanitzia Irizarry (Family), Miguel Hernández Vivoni (Housing), Jesús F.

5|$|Impermeable plasma {{is a type}} {{of thermal}} plasma which acts like an {{impermeable}} solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be physically pushed. Interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a <b>group</b> <b>led</b> by Hannes Alfvén in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of fusion plasma from the reactor walls. However, later {{it was found that the}} external magnetic fields in this configuration could induce kink instabilities in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly high heat loss to the walls.|$|E

5|$|In 1949 the Armenian Academy of Sciences began major {{excavations}} of the Garni fortress site led by Babken Arakelyan. Architectural historian Alexander Sahinian {{focused on}} the temple itself. It was not until almost twenty years later, on December 10, 1968, that the Soviet Armenian government approved the reconstruction plan of the temple. A <b>group</b> <b>led</b> by Sahinian began reconstruction works in January 1969. It was completed by 1975, almost 300 {{years after it was}} destroyed in an earthquake. The temple was almost entirely rebuilt using its original stones, except the missing pieces which were filled with blank stones intended to be easily recognisable. In 1978 a monument dedicated to Sahinian was erected not far from the temple.|$|E
5|$|In June 1963 the Spokane Comets Western Hockey League {{franchise}} {{was purchased}} by a <b>group</b> <b>led</b> by the Maple Leafs, who relocated them to become the Denver Invaders and act as the Leaf's farm team. Though the league did not acknowledge that the Maple Leafs had an ownership stake in the team, they held a majority position with the Denver partners only owning roughly 36%. Following reported losses of $150,000 in their first season, Smythe announced that the team would be relocated after the team failed to reach a 2,000 season ticket target by a league-imposed deadline. The team became the Victoria Maple Leafs for the following season. In June 1967 MLGL sold the team for $500,000 to a group from Phoenix, which relocated it to become the Phoenix Roadrunners.|$|E
