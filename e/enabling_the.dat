5|$|According {{to current}} {{physical}} cosmology theory, carbon is {{formed in the}} interiors of stars in the horizontal branch by the collision and transformation of three helium nuclei.

5|$|As a result, most geysers form {{in places}} where there is {{volcanic}} rhyolite rock which dissolves in hot water and forms mineral deposits called siliceous sinter, or geyserite, along {{the inside of the}} plumbing systems which are very slender.

5|$|At {{the same}} time as his successes in Paris, Meyerbeer, as a Prussian Court Kapellmeister (Director of Music) from 1832, and from 1843 as Prussian General Music Director, was also {{influential}} in opera in Berlin and throughout Germany. He was an early supporter of Richard Wagner, <b>enabling</b> <b>the</b> first production of the latter's opera, Rienzi. He was commissioned to write the patriotic opera Ein Feldlager in Schlesien to celebrate the reopening of the Berlin Royal Opera House in 1844 and wrote music for certain Prussian state occasions.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1916, Canadian {{physicist}} Robert William Boyle {{and other}} scientists of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research which ultimately {{led to the development}} of sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines, thus <b>enabling</b> <b>the</b> German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision of these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids {{are also}} {{valuable}} sources for squid giant axons used in research in neuroscience and physiology. Unlike axons of other animals, squid axons are very large. Those of bigfin reef squids can range in diameter from 350 to 560μm (in {{contrast to the}} typical 1μm for humans). In life, these giant axons are used by the squids to coordinate escape jetting behaviour, <b>enabling</b> <b>the</b> squid to contract its muscles {{in a split second}} directly from the brain.|$|E
