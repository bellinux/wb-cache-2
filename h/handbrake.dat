5|$|In 2004, {{just two}} years before the release of the VE Commodore, Holden {{unveiled}} the Torana TT36 concept car at the Australian International Motor Show in Sydney. The TT36 served as a preview of the VE and allowed Holden to gauge public reaction to its styling. Much of the Torana's styling drew on the essence of the VE's design. Some production-ready components even carried over from the TT36 including the steering wheel, the window and rear-view mirror switch cluster and the <b>handbrake</b> lever.|$|E
25|$|This film {{introduces}} {{the idea of}} including Earth-centric elements on the TARDIS control console, such as an early 20th-Century automobile <b>handbrake,</b> apparently used for a similar purpose. This was used again in the 2005 and 2010 designs of the console.|$|E
25|$|As delivered, {{the only}} means of braking the {{locomotive}} was by operating a <b>handbrake</b> on the tender wheels. B 50 and B 108 were used in comparative trials of the Woods hydraulic and Westinghouse air brake systems in January 1884, with the Westinghouse system being later adopted as the standard.|$|E
50|$|Almost all railway {{cars and}} {{locomotives}} have <b>handbrakes</b> for one, more or all axles. No {{one on the}} train applies them, although they are near the handwheel. On the summit where the train practically comes to a standstill {{it would have been}} easy to apply some <b>handbrakes</b> and prevent the train rolling down.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{believed}} that the <b>handbrakes</b> {{on one of the}} carriages may have been applied as a stunt.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Knee and Leg Walker by Essential Medical Supply. This {{version has}} an {{adjustable}} cushion and handlebars, with dual <b>handbrakes.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Majestic's four-wheel Lockheed-servo-assisted Dunlop {{disc brakes}} were {{regarded}} as a first for a British production car. It was the first saloon car without any claim to a sportscar nature to be equipped with disc brakes. An emergency or <b>handbrake</b> was provided by fitting special pads to the rear brake discs which were operated by cables and rods.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the seven}} Greenly tenders {{supplied}} new with locos 1–8, two {{are still in}} service albeit with new bodies to the original design. Originally built with vacuum brakes and a <b>handbrake,</b> both brake systems have been removed, leaving them as through-piped only. They were coupled to Hercules and Samson but withdrawn from mainline service due to concerns over safety, and their coal and water capacity.|$|E
25|$|VLC {{can handle}} some {{incomplete}} files {{and in some}} cases can be used to preview files being downloaded. Several programs make use of this, including eMule and KCeasy. The free/open-source Internet television application Miro also uses VLC code. <b>HandBrake,</b> an open-source video encoder, used to load libdvdcss from VLC Media Player. A program named Livestreamer may utilize VLC as its main video stream player and will not work without one.|$|E
50|$|In March 2008 Honda {{announced}} that it was recalling 79,000 eighth generation Civics due to a potential problem with faulty <b>handbrakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|From 1935 to 1939 {{close to}} 4,000 welded Om wagons appeared, without <b>handbrakes,</b> that were grouped into the Breslau and Essen classes.|$|R
5000|$|Wand is also {{a common}} {{reference}} to an automotive handbrake/parking brake, in motorsport rally drivers would refer to their hydraulic <b>handbrakes</b> as [...] "the Wand" ...|$|R
25|$|Runlock: This {{allows the}} vehicle's engine {{to be left}} running without the keys being in the ignition. This enables {{adequate}} power, without battery drain, to be supplied to the vehicle's equipment {{at the scene of}} an incident. The vehicle can only be driven off after re-inserting the keys. If the keys are not re-inserted, the engine will switch off if the <b>handbrake</b> is disengaged or the footbrake is activated.|$|E
25|$|The inquiry {{began at}} Glasgow Sheriff Court on 22 July 2015 before Sheriff John Beckett QC. Evidence to the inquiry found {{there were no}} {{mechanical}} faults with the vehicle and that the other two crew members would {{have been unable to}} apply the <b>handbrake</b> because they were wearing their seatbelts. No other safety devices were fitted to the vehicle that would have allowed a crew member not in the driver's seat to stop the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The United Electric Car Company of Preston built 15 {{double deck}} balcony cars for Sheffield Corporation Tramways in 1907. Initially {{numbered}} 258272 they had wooden seats for 59 passengers, and were {{mounted on a}} four-wheel Peckham P22 truck with two Metrovick 102DR 60hp motors operated by BTH B510 controllers. The braking systems consisted of a <b>handbrake</b> acting on all wheels, an electric brake for emergency use and a hand-wheel operated track brake. Between December 1924 and July 1927 they were rebuilt with a totally enclosed upper deck.|$|E
50|$|Other {{improvements}} {{across the}} board included: pistol-grip <b>handbrakes</b> under the dashboard, increased luggage accommodation, piston-type hydraulic shock absorbers, more accessible batteries and a quick-filling petrol tank.|$|R
50|$|Motorkhana (as it {{is known}} in Australia and New Zealand) and autotesting (UK and Ireland) are related sports. With speeds rarely {{exceeding}} 40 mph (60 km/h), both motorkhana and autotesting are slower than American autocross, require <b>handbraking,</b> and have sections that must be negotiated in reverse. On the other hand, autocross speeds can reach over 60 mph (100 km/h) and courses {{that would require the}} driver to enter reverse are generally prohibited in autocross. <b>Handbraking</b> is also not usually necessary on a typical autocross course.|$|R
50|$|On July 8, Transport Canada {{investigated}} {{a second}} MMA train reported by police as unattended since July 5 on the Vachon Station siding near Frontenac. That train had been parked on a slope with only five <b>handbrakes</b> set, {{and did not}} comply with federal regulations. At least nine brakes should have be used to secure the train on level track, with additional <b>handbrakes</b> applied when on an incline. A local resident had posted online video of an unattended locomotive with a cabin door ajar and an engine left running.|$|R
25|$|The Veyron's brakes use cross drilled, {{radially}} vented {{carbon fibre}} reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) composite discs, manufactured by SGL Carbon, {{which have a}} much greater resistance to brake fade when compared with conventional cast iron discs. The lightweight aluminium alloy monobloc brake calipers are made by AP Racing; the fronts have eight titanium pistons and the rear calipers have six pistons. Bugatti claims maximum deceleration of 1.3g on road tyres. As an added safety feature, {{in the event of}} brake failure, an anti-lock braking system (ABS) has also been installed on the <b>handbrake.</b>|$|E
25|$|South Shields 196 {{was built}} in 1935 at the Boavista Works of Oporto Tramways Company of Oporto (Porto), Portugal. A small 4-wheel single decker, one of a batch of 77 similar examples, {{it was based on}} an American design dating from 1909. Mounted on a Brill 21E truck, it has two GE(USA) 270A 55hp motors with licensee-built B54E controllers, and brakes using air-brake, {{emergency}} electric brake, and a <b>handbrake</b> operated by distinctive vertical hand-wheels {{to the right of the}} driver’s position. After rebuild, it has seating arranged longitudinally for 28 passengers.|$|E
25|$|Changes {{were again}} modest: Five smaller front fender vents {{replaced}} the three larger ones, and flat-finish rockers sans ribbing conferred a lower, less chunky appearance. New {{was a single}} backup light, mounted above the license plate. The previous models' wheel covers gave way to slotted six-inch Rally wheels with chrome beauty rings and lug nuts concealed behind chrome caps. Interior alterations were modest and included revised upholstery, and the <b>handbrake</b> moved from beneath the dash to between the seats. The convertible's optional hardtop was offered with a black vinyl cover, which was a fad among all cars at the time.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "van" [...] was {{actually}} a short bogie flat wagon, fitted centrally with a plastic cabin and verandah over the <b>handbrakes.</b> The other end held the gas and electrical fittings.|$|R
5|$|Two {{distinct}} functions – {{first that}} of traction by adhesion as in an ordinary loco; second that of traction by pinions {{acting on the}} track bars. The brakes are four in number – two <b>handbrakes,</b> acting by friction; and two acting by preventing the free escape of air from cylinder and thus using compressed air in retarding {{the progress of the}} engine. The former are used for shunting whilst the later for descending steep gradients. One of the <b>handbrakes</b> acts on the tyres of the wheels in the ordinary manner and the second acts on grooved surfaces of the pinion axle, but can be used in those places where the rack is laid.|$|R
5000|$|The trains were loose-coupled, had no {{continuous}} brakes, {{and were}} speed-limited to 25 mi/h km/h. The lack of brake power {{was a potential}} hazard and, when approaching a downhill gradient, {{it was necessary to}} stop the train and [...] "pin down" [...] the <b>handbrakes</b> on some of the wagons before proceeding.|$|R
25|$|The KR175 {{used the}} {{standard}} Kabinenroller steering system, with a steering bar connected {{directly to the}} track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small, measured inputs. The KR175's steering bar was made from tubular steel. The gearshift lever, {{on the right side}} of the cockpit, had a secondary lever on it which operated the clutch. The throttle was operated by a twist-grip on the left handlebar. The foot brake pedal, which was the only pedal in the car, operated brakes on all three wheels mechanically, using cables. The <b>handbrake</b> lever operated similarly.|$|E
25|$|The freakish {{conditions}} spawned unique effects: a car {{was forced}} 90m along a road with its <b>handbrake</b> on, burning mattresses were seen hurtling through the air, steaks were cooked well-done in deep freezers, road surfaces bubbled and caught fire and sand liquefied to glass. CSIRO experts later reported that, from evidence of melted metal, {{the heat of}} the fires after the change rose to 2000°C, exceeding that recorded during the Allied bombing of Dresden in World War II. In fact, the Ash Wednesday fires were measured at around 60,000 kilowatts of heat energy per metre, leading to similarities with the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.|$|E
25|$|Sheffield 264 {{was built}} by the United Electric Car Company of Preston for Sheffield Corporation Tramways, one of a batch of fifteen double deck open balcony cars {{delivered}} in 1907. It was built with wooden seats for 54 passengers, mounted on a 4-wheel Peckham P22 truck with two Metrovick 102DR 60hp motors using BTH B510 controllers, with braking systems being a <b>handbrake</b> acting on all wheels, an electric brake for emergency use and a hand-wheel operated track brake. A 1926 rebuild included modification to a fully enclosed upper deck. Displaced to peak hour use in the 1930s, it was renumbered 342, but was not withdrawn until 1956.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, {{several members}} of the class {{received}} a commemorative plaque beneath their <b>handbrakes</b> in recognition of their 40 years of service with CIÉ and Iarnród Éireann. Loco 071 was repainted back to its original CIÉ Supertrain livery of black and orange in May 2016, with its first working thereafter being the RPSI diesel tour from Dublin to Waterford and Limerick Junction.|$|R
50|$|The {{detached}} {{portion of}} no 62 consisted of 12 vehicles, and its length 331 {{feet with a}} weight of 264 tons. <b>Handbrakes</b> were applied to these vehicles. It {{would appear that the}} train staff in the possession of the engine crew was returned to the instrument in the signal box at this time, and all vehicles were {{within the confines of the}} home signals.|$|R
50|$|Coal {{production}} from the mines increased greatly when the railway opened, as it permitted much larger quantities of coal to be carried. Workings on the Roa Incline were spectacular; sometimes {{up to eight}} trains a day would run down the Incline, relying only on <b>handbrakes</b> to avoid a runaway. Passenger services were operated to Blackball {{for a number of}} years, primarily for the mine workers, and these ceased in 1940.|$|R
25|$|On 6 May 1990, 3801 was {{involved}} in the Cowan rail disaster. 3801 was struggling to climb the Cowan Bank (on the Sydney side of the Hawkesbury River) when returning from the Morpeth Jazz Festival when a CityRail Interurban passenger service crashed into the back of 3801's train. Six people lost their lives, including driver of the intercity electric, and a passenger in the V Set's cab. 3801 applied sand to the track to assist grip and an investigation into the crash suggested this may have caused the signals to malfunction. The signals changed from red to green several times. After the signals were green for a few moments, the interurban driver then entered the tunnel behind 3801 where the accident occurred. The <b>handbrake</b> in one of the carriages may also have been applied.|$|E
25|$|The {{train was}} re-equipped with 8 Southerner cars (former Main South Line {{first-class}} cars) and two former FM class guards vans of a modular design, one from Mitsubishi, {{the other from}} Daewoo, turned into power-luggage vans with <b>handbrake</b> end-mounted 11kW generators. The Northerner service seated 53 or 45 per car to compensate for reduced carriages in reclining road coach-style seats as opposed to 30 or 25. From its inception, it {{also included in the}} two catering cars and, in 1992, in the two 37-seat cars to retain their coupe compartments when three trainsets were made available, video entertainment, comprising a large screen GoldStar television at one edge of the carriage showing movies with the sound piped throughout the carriage. The 15 parcels wagons remained dedicated to the service till 1991, when Speedlink Parcels was sold to New Zealand Post, some still bearing the old yellow Northerner livery.|$|E
25|$|Realising this {{increased}} public attention, {{and with the}} success of air-conditioned panorama carriage trains on the North Island Main Trunk, between August 1994 and April 1995, eight cars (one a former Southerner then InterCity spare buffet car, one a former Endeavour later Southerner servery car, two from the Northerner, two from the Southerner and two from Auckland suburban services) were extensively overhauled and refitted with panorama windows like the earlier TranzAlpine, TranzCoastal (later Coastal Pacific), pressure-ventilated Bay Express and air conditioned Northerner/Overlander Express trains and seating 50 (day cars) and 26 (servery cars), alcove-style, in new seats like those installed in refitted Wairarapa Connection and North Island Main Trunk carriages. A Mitsubishi built modular van was refitted with a 90kW generator in the central module as opposed to the <b>handbrake</b> end modules on NIMT vans, to facilitate converting one end module into a public open viewing area.|$|E
5000|$|The {{guard of}} no 62 {{released}} the <b>handbrakes</b> {{on the rear}} portion, leaving it unbraked and the driver went forward to his engine. When he started the train the tailrope broke and the rear portion began to run back down the grade towards Blandford, coming into collision with the approaching mail train just beyond the Up Distant signal. The collision resulted {{in the death of}} 26 persons. (Gunn has 27 fatalities.) ...|$|R
5000|$|On 22 August 1925 a train hauled by No.3 Pender {{ran into}} Douglas station with {{insufficient}} braking {{power as a}} misunderstanding had resulted in the Guard and Brakesman being left behind at Union Mills, resulting in there being no-one on board the forward and rear brake vans to apply the train <b>handbrakes.</b> The Fireman of the train was killed but the Driver, William Costain, escaped unhurt. Vacuum brakes were introduced {{as a result of}} the accident.|$|R
50|$|The CACV {{was used}} during the 1980s to store large numbers of idle St. Lawrence Railroad boxcars. Several of these cars were stored on Clintonville Hill in the {{vicinity}} of milepost 7, secured only with <b>handbrakes</b> despite the steepness of the grade. Vandals released the brakes on several cars, which rolled southward and derailed {{at the foot of the}} grade. Metal pieces from the wreck can be found between the railroad right of way and the west bank of the Susquehanna River.|$|R
