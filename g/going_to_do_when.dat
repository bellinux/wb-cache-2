2500|$|In April 1940 he {{was traded}} to the Detroit Lions in {{exchange}} for two rookie players. However, Smukler decided to leave football and join the United States Army. He said, “I got $3,000 a year for playing football professionally. It was great during the season. Everybody shook your hand, slapped you on the back, and told you what a swell fellow you were. But the rest of the time, I couldn’t get a job.” Between football seasons Smukler could only make money doing piecework as a glove cutter. “It was enough to discourage any man, and I kept thinking about what I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> I couldn’t play football anymore. I sat down and figured it out and then decided my best bet was the Army.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{protest of}} the decision, on February 5, 2005, {{students}} formed a sit-in while reading {{passages from the}} center of the school gymnasium. They had shirts with handwritten designs of Bless Me, Ultima; however, only eight of the twenty students had heard or read of the book. Despite staying with his decision to keep the book banned, he acknowledged and respected the decision of the students to make a vocal protest. He told the students his choice was made in order to protect them while a student, Serena Campbell, responded by stating “If we’re sheltered all our lives, what are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> we get to college? If I’m not exposed now, how am I going to get by in life?”.

Moreover, he planned to apologize to Doyle.|$|E
2500|$|Going into season three, the Smallville crew {{wanted to}} {{establish}} two main themes, {{which were the}} consequences of Clark running from his destiny, and Lex taking steps toward [...] "the dark side". One of the consequences the creative team attempted to show for Clark was his distancing himself from his friends. Season three was also about showing just how evil Lionel is – illustrated by how he attempts to destroy Chloe’s life and make Lex {{believe that he is}} going insane. In order to get better performances from the actors in each individual episode, the crew would often limit the detail an actor knew about their character. Meeting just {{at the beginning of the}} year to discuss the plans for the actor’s respective roles, usually the actors would only find out precisely what their characters were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> the scripts arrived. Other times, an actor might be given a specific piece of character development and told to keep it a secret from the rest of the cast.|$|E

5000|$|It's so cool! On {{the day we}} were filming it we just couldn't picture what it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be like.

6000|$|... "It isn't so very strange," [...] said Bob, as {{he started}} his team along at a walk, [...] "and, as usual, it's all my fault.

Klinger asked, [...] "Does Uri Geller have any supernatural powers?" [...] Andrus gave {{the short answer}} [...] "No." [...] Hyman stated, [...] "(Geller) is an opportunist... {{which is why it}} is difficult to duplicate him, he himself cannot duplicate himself.

6000|$|... "I am reasonable, Mary," [...] roared the gallant soldier, {{becoming}} a rich purple. [...] "I know my duty, thank God! and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. <b>When</b> a man insults my daughter, it's my duty, as a gentleman and an officer, {{to give him}} a jolly good thrashing. When that twopenny sawbones of a doctor was rude to you, I licked him within an inch of his life. I kicked him till he begged for mercy; and if more men had the courage to take the law into their own hands, there'd be fewer damned blackguards in the world." ...|$|R
60|$|Louise did {{not come}} down till she heard Godolphin walking away on the plank. She said to herself that she had shipwrecked her husband once by putting in her oar, {{and she was not}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it again. <b>When</b> the actor's footfalls died out in the {{distance}} she descended to the parlor, where she found Maxwell over his manuscript at the table.|$|R

60|$|Obediently Denis {{left the}} room. Never again, {{he said to}} himself, never again would he do {{anything}} decisive. Camlet, West Bowlby, Knipswich for Timpany, Spavin Delawarr; {{and then all the}} other stations; and then, finally, London. The thought of the journey appalled him. And what on earth was he <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in London <b>when</b> he got there? He climbed wearily up the stairs. It was time for him to lay himself in his coffin.|$|R
6000|$|...

6000|$|... "There's another thing," [...] Scott went on. [...] "Since the Clermont isn't paying, I might lend you to Miss Strange if {{you were}} anxious to {{undertake}} the development work, but the law doesn't require very much of this.

6000|$|... "Not now," [...] she {{interrupted}} hastily. [...] "Do you know, I fancy {{that we must}} {{be getting}} too confidential. That odious man with the eyeglass keeps staring at us.

5000|$|... "In other corporations, police get involved," [...] said Kendall Carver, an Arizona {{resident}} {{who founded the}} lobbying group International Cruise Victims after his own daughter's 2004 disappearance from the Celebrity Mercury. [...] "On cruise ships they have, quote, security officers, but they work for the cruise lines. They aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything <b>when</b> the lines get sued." [...] Miami lawyer Jim Walker, publisher of the blog Cruise Law News, which is {{highly critical of the}} industry, concurs. [...] "The Coriam family does not deserve Mickey Mouse games," [...] he commented in Ronson's article. Walker later represented the Coriams in a suit against Disney in American courts; they settled with the company in 2015 for an undisclosed sum and an agreement not to discuss the case publicly.|$|R
60|$|His {{wife and}} Mrs. Cliff had corresponded with some regularity, but the latter had never {{mentioned}} {{the fact that}} she was the owner of a yacht. Mrs. Cliff had intended to tell Edna all about this new piece of property, but when she looked at the matter from an outside point of view, it seemed to her such a ridiculous thing that she should own a yacht that she <b>did</b> not want <b>to</b> write anything about it until her plans were perfected, and she could tell just what she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> But <b>when</b> she suddenly decided to sail for Jamaica, her mind was so occupied with the plans of the moment that she had no time to write.|$|R
