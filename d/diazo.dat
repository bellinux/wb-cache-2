25|$|Manganates, {{particularly}} the insoluble barium manganate, BaMnO4, {{have been used}} as oxidizing agents in organic synthesis: they will oxidize primary alcohols to aldehydes and then to carboxylic acids, and secondary alcohols to ketones. Barium manganate has also been used to oxidize hydrazones to <b>diazo</b> compounds.|$|E
25|$|Oil Red O (Solvent Red 27, Sudan Red 5B, C.I. 26125, C26H24N4O) is a lysochrome (fat-soluble dye) <b>diazo</b> dye {{used for}} {{staining}} of neutral triglycerides and lipids on frozen sections and some lipoproteins on paraffin sections. It has {{the appearance of}} a red powder with maximum absorption at 518 (359)nm.|$|E
25|$|Discoveries {{in color}} science created new {{industries}} and drove changes in fashion and taste. The discovery in 1856 of mauveine, the first aniline dye, was a forerunner {{for the development}} of hundreds of synthetic dyes and pigments like azo and <b>diazo</b> compounds which are the source of a wide spectrum of colors. Mauveine was discovered by an 18-year-old chemist named William Henry Perkin, who went on to exploit his discovery in industry and become wealthy. His success attracted a generation of followers, as young scientists went into organic chemistry to pursue riches. Within a few years, chemists had synthesized a substitute for madder in the production of Alizarin Crimson. By the closing decades of the 19th century, textiles, paints, and other commodities in colors such as red, crimson, blue, and purple had become affordable.|$|E
25|$|Pigments appear {{the colors}} they are because they {{selectively}} reflect and absorb certain wavelengths of visible light. White light is a roughly equal {{mixture of the}} entire spectrum of visible light with a wavelength in a range from about 375 or 400 nanometers to about 760 or 780nm. When this light encounters a pigment, parts of the spectrum are absorbed by the molecules or ions of the pigment. In organic pigments such as <b>diazo</b> or phthalocyanine compounds the light is absorbed by the conjugated systems of double bonds in the molecule. Some of the inorganic pigments such as vermilion (mercury sulfide) or cadmium yellow (cadmium sulfide) absorb light by transferring an electron from the negative ion (S2−) to the positive ion (Hg2+ or Cd2+). Such compounds are designated as charge-transfer complexes, with broad absorption bands that subtract most of {{the colors of the}} incident white light. The other wavelengths or parts of the spectrum are reflected or scattered. The new reflected light spectrum creates the appearance of a color. Pigments, unlike fluorescent or phosphorescent substances, can only subtract wavelengths from the source light, never add new ones.|$|E
2500|$|The D {{ring was}} {{synthesized}} starting from chiral (S)-camphor 8 which was converted to oxime 9 (oxidation / hydroxylamine [...] ), then to amide 10 (hydrolysis), lactam 11 (acid-amide condensation), N-nitroso compound 12, <b>diazo</b> compound 13 and to cyclopentene 14 (carbene, methyl group migration). Reduction (LiAlH4) gave alcohol 15, oxidation (chromic acid) gave aldehyde 16, a Wittig reaction with carbomethoxymethylenetriphenylphosphorane gave trans-alkene 17 and hydrolysis gave carboxylic acid 18.|$|E
50|$|Then in 1992, Roskamp and {{co-workers}} expanded {{the scope of}} diazoacetate to <b>diazo</b> sulfones, <b>diazo</b> phosphonates and <b>diazo</b> phosphine oxides.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diazo</b> {{refers to}} a type of organic {{compound}} called <b>diazo</b> compound that has two linked nitrogen atoms (azo) as a terminal functional group. The general formula is R2C=N2. The simplest example of a <b>diazo</b> compound is diazomethane. The electronic structure of <b>diazo</b> compounds involves a positive charge on the central nitrogen and negative charge distributed between the terminal nitrogen and the carbon. Some of the most stable <b>diazo</b> compounds are α-diazo-ß-diketones and α-diazo-ß-diesters since the negative charge is delocalized into the carbonyls. In contrast, most alkyldiazo compounds are explosive. A commercially relevant <b>diazo</b> compound is ethyl diazoacetate (N2CHCOOEt). A group of isomeric compounds with only few similar properties are the diazirines, where the carbon and two nitrogens are linked as a ring.|$|E

5000|$|... 2-Iodobenzoic acid can be {{synthesized}} via a Sandmeyer reaction {{consisting of}} the diazotization of anthranilic acid followed by a <b>diazo</b> replacement. First anthranilic acid is treated with nitrous acid in order to convert the amino group into the <b>diazo</b> group. The <b>diazo</b> group is ejected, yielding a carbocation which is then attacked by highly nucleophilic I− anion.|$|E
5000|$|A reoccurring {{substrate}} is a <b>diazo</b> {{compound and}} more specifically an alpha-carbonyl <b>diazo</b> compound.For example, ethyl diazoacetate is converted to diethyl maleate using the ruthenium catalyst chloro(cyclopentadienyl)bis(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Diazo</b> {{compounds}} are ambiphilic reagents. According to its resonance structure, {{the carbon}} {{adjacent to the}} <b>diazo</b> group has partial negative charge. If R’ = H, this {{can be regarded as}} a hydride-transfer process.|$|E
50|$|The Barton-Kellogg {{reaction}} is a coupling reaction between a <b>diazo</b> compound and a thioketone through a <b>diazo</b> intermediate forming an alkene. The Barton-Kellogg {{reaction is}} also known as Barton-Kellogg olefination and Barton olefin synthesis.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{families}} of naturally occurring products feature the <b>diazo</b> group: kinamycin and lomaiviticin. These molecules are DNA-intercalators, with <b>diazo</b> functionality as their [...] "warheads". Loss of N2, induced reductively, generates a DNA-cleaving fluorenyl radical.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{treatment}} with sulfonyl azides, {{a variety of}} Grignard reagents or enolates may be converted into azides or amines. A significant side reaction that occurs under these conditions is the <b>diazo</b> transfer reaction: instead of fragmenting into an azide and sulfinic acid, the intermediate triazene salt may break down to a <b>diazo</b> compound and sulfonamide. Changing workup conditions may favor one product over another. In general, for reactions of enolates substituted with Evans oxazolidinones, trifluoroacetic acid promotes <b>diazo</b> transfer while acetic acid encourages azidation (the reasons why are unclear). Solvent and the enolate counterion also influence the observed ratio of <b>diazo</b> to azide products.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diazo</b> was {{originally}} a reimplementation {{of an earlier}} software called Deliverance. Where Deliverance would handle the HTML transformation in Python, <b>Diazo</b> generates XSLT which can then be used to defer the actual transformation to faster XSLT engines.|$|E
50|$|In the Doyle-Kirmse {{reaction}} certain <b>diazo</b> compounds {{react with}} allyl sulfides to the homoallyl sulfide.

50|$|<b>Diazo</b> {{compounds}} may be {{used more}} safely by reacting them with transition metals compounds (typically containing Cu, Pd, Ni, Co or Rh) to form metal carbenoid complexes. These readily undergo intermolecular metal-catalyzed carbenoid cyclopropanations with olefins and are far safer than the starting <b>diazo</b> materials as they are not explosive. This process also allows for enantioselective synthesis through the presence of chiral ligands or by adding chiral auxiliaries to the <b>diazo</b> compound.|$|E
50|$|The <b>diazo</b> copies are of {{different}} sizes {{and for this reason}} the <b>diazo</b> paper is obtainable in standard sizes that vary from 30 cm to 60 cm wide, after de process the copied paper can be cut to the desired size.|$|E

50|$|If {{the lines}} are too light, it is also {{possible}} to run the blue-line through the developing chamber once more, which often increases the contrast of the lines relative to the base media. Repeated lack of contrast and light prints is also a tip-off that the operator needs to adjust the speed or amount of ammonia. Sometimes both the master and the <b>diazo</b> print are inadvertently fed through the developing chamber together. If this occurs, one simply peels the master from the <b>diazo</b> paper and runs the <b>diazo</b> sheet through the developer once more to more fully develop the lines.|$|E
