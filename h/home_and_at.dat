After the fall of Communism, the Polish government, dominated by Catholic political parties, introduced a de facto legal ban on abortions. Since then, some feminists have adopted argumentative strategies from the 1980s American pro-choice movement.|$|E

25|$|The {{ability for}} gaming {{consoles}} to exist anywhere and be purchased by anyone also allows {{this sort of}} therapy to be quite personalized to the patient.

Being able to bring their therapy into the comfort of their own <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>at</b> a relatively low cost contributes to these outcomes. Additionally, as a result of their increased adherence to therapy and motivation to engage in therapy, patients who engage in gaming rehabilitation have also shown improved outcomes of their efforts.|$|E

25|$|In {{the privacy}} of their own homes, people are more casual in {{relation}} to clothing, though what each considers appropriate varies considerably. What and how much clothing a person removes depends on a number of considerations, including the cultural background and on whether the person is alone in {{the privacy of}} their own homes. The removal of overclothing, such as coats, hats, gloves, scarves and the like, is the norm in virtually all households. It is also common for people to remove outdoor shoes when entering one's <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>at</b> times guests may also be expected to do the same. It is also common to change out of work clothes (such as a suit and tie, overalls etc.) into something lighter, looser and more comfortable, and perhaps for a woman to remove her bra or stockings. Beyond that, how much more is removed depends on personal taste, habits, circumstance and relationships of the people inside the household at a particular time.|$|E
