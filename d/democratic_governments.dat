5|$|Congress further {{weakened}} the acts in 1894 by removing a provision against conspiracy. In 1877, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes {{was elected president}} after a highly contested election, receiving support from three Southern states {{in exchange for a}} pledge to allow white <b>Democratic</b> <b>governments</b> to rule without federal interference. As president, he refused to enforce federal civil rights protections, allowing states to begin to implement racially discriminatory Jim Crow laws. A Federal Elections Bill was successfully filibustered in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The Macedonian kings, who wielded {{absolute}} power and commanded state {{resources such as}} gold and silver, facilitated mining operations to mint currency, finance their armies and, by the reign of PhilipII, a Macedonian navy. Unlike the other diadochi successor states, the imperial cult fostered by Alexander was never adopted in Macedonia, yet Macedonian rulers nevertheless assumed roles as high priests of the kingdom and leading patrons of domestic and international cults of the Hellenistic religion. The authority of Macedonian kings was theoretically limited by {{the institution of the}} army, while a few municipalities within the Macedonian commonwealth enjoyed a high degree of autonomy and even had <b>democratic</b> <b>governments</b> with popular assemblies.|$|E

25|$|In Latin American {{countries}} in which ISI was most successful, it was accompanied by structural changes to the government.

25|$|Fascist {{governments in}} both Italy and Germany privatized {{state-owned}} enterprises at certain times. These privatizations {{were carried out}} {{in the early stages of}} both regimes (1922-25 for Italy and 1934-37 for Germany), and represented a reversal of the policies of the <b>democratic</b> <b>governments</b> which had preceded them. The <b>democratic</b> <b>governments</b> had brought a number of industries under state ownership, and the fascists decided to return them to private ownership. In doing so, they went against the mainstream economic trends of their time, when most Western governments were increasing state ownership. Fascist privatization policies were driven by a desire to secure the support of wealthy industrialists, as well as by the need to increase government revenues in order to balance budgets. Significantly, fascist governments were among the first to undertake large-scale privatizations in modern times.|$|E

25|$|The {{domino effect}} of the {{revolutions}} of 1989 affected other regimes as well. The South African apartheid regime and Pinochet's military dictatorship in Chile were gradually dismantled during the 1990s as the West withdrew their funding and diplomatic support.

25|$|After {{the end of}} Reconstruction and the {{withdrawal}} of federal troops, which followed from the Compromise of 1877, the <b>Democratic</b> <b>governments</b> in the South instituted state laws to separate black and white racial groups, submitting African-Americans to de facto second-class citizenship and enforcing white supremacy. Collectively, these state laws were called the Jim Crow system, after {{the name of a}} stereotypical 1830s black minstrel show character. Sometimes, as in Florida's Constitution of 1885, segregation was mandated by state constitutions.|$|E
25|$|Today, Africa {{contains}} 54 sovereign countries, most {{of which}} have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and authoritarianism. The vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule. However, few {{of them have been}} able to sustain <b>democratic</b> <b>governments</b> on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of coups, producing military dictatorships.|$|E
40|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of decades of public sector reforms in Europe, this essay aims {{to make sense of}} the processes through which institutions, <b>democratic</b> <b>government</b> included, achieve and lose autonomy or primacy and why it is difficult to find a state of equilibrium between <b>democratic</b> <b>government</b> and institutional autonomy. The analytical value of ‘autonomy’ as detachment-from-politics and the apolitical dynamics of change assumed by NPM reformers are challenged. In contrast, the interplay between <b>democratic</b> <b>government</b> and institutional autonomy is interpreted as an artifact of partly de-coupled inter-institutional processes involving struggle for power and status among interdependent and co-evolving institutions that are carriers of competing yet legitimate values, interests and behavioral logics. The problem of finding a stable equilibrium between <b>democratic</b> <b>government,</b> autonomous agencies and non-majoritarian institutions, is illustrated by the cases of public administration and the public university.

5|$|From 1855 to 1907, the {{position}} of first minister was known as Premier.

25|$|A report {{published}} in January 2011 by the Diário de Notícias, a leading Portuguese newspaper, demonstrated {{that during the}} period of the Carnation Revolution, from 1974 to 2010, the Portuguese <b>democratic</b> <b>governments</b> have encouraged over-expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear public-private partnerships. Consequently, numerous ineffective external consultancy/advising committees and firms were funded, and this facilitated considerable slippage in state-managed public works, inflated top management and head officers' bonuses and wages. Additionally, a recruitment policy eventuated that has boosted the number of redundant public servants.|$|E
25|$|Another {{part of the}} {{intellectual}} underpinning of the Bush Doctrine was the 2004 book The Case for Democracy, written by Israeli politician and author Natan Sharansky and Israeli Minister of Economic Affairs in the United States Ron Dermer, which Bush has cited as influential in his thinking. The book argues that replacing dictatorships with <b>democratic</b> <b>governments</b> is both morally justified, since it leads to greater freedom for the citizens of such countries, and strategically wise, since democratic countries are more peaceful, and breed less terrorism than dictatorial ones.|$|E
25|$|In {{a series}} of speeches in late 2001 and 2002, Bush {{expanded}} on his view of American foreign policy and global intervention, declaring that the United States should actively support <b>democratic</b> <b>governments</b> around the world, especially in the Middle East, as a strategy for combating the threat of terrorism, and that the United States {{had the right to}} act unilaterally in its own security interests, without the approval of international bodies such as the United Nations. This represented a departure from the Cold War policies of deterrence and containment under the Truman Doctrine and post–Cold War philosophies such as the Powell Doctrine and the Clinton Doctrine.|$|E

In an era when <b>democratic</b> <b>governments</b> formed {{in the aftermath of the}} First World War were moving away from democracy and towards dictatorships, the Free State, under Cosgrave, remained unambiguously democratic, a fact shown by his handing over of power to his one-time friend, then rival, Éamon de Valera, when de Valera's Fianna Fáil won the 1932 General Election, in the process killing off talk within the Irish Army of staging a coup to keep Cosgrave in power and de Valera out of it.|$|E
25|$|O'Sullivan's {{original}} {{conception of}} manifest destiny {{was not a}} call for territorial expansion by force. He believed that {{the expansion of the}} United States would happen without the direction of the U.S.government or the involvement of the military. After Americans immigrated to new regions, they would set up new <b>democratic</b> <b>governments,</b> and then seek admission to the United States, as Texas had done. In 1845, O'Sullivan predicted that California would follow this pattern next, and that Canada would eventually request annexation as well. He disapproved of the Mexican–American War in 1846, although he came to believe that the outcome would be beneficial to both countries.|$|E

After 16 years of New <b>Democratic</b> <b>governments</b> under premiers Roy Romanow and Lorne Calvert, the 2007 provincial election was won by the Saskatchewan Party under Brad Wall.
