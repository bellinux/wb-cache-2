40|$|Progress in {{understanding}} the coupling between plasma instabilities in the equatorial electrojet based on a unified fluid model is reported. A {{deeper understanding of the}} linear and nonlinear evolution and the coupling of the gradient-drift and Farley-Buneman instabilities is achieved by studying the effect of different combinations of the density-gradient scale-lengths (Ln) and cross-field (E?B) drifts on the plasma turbulence. Mechanisms and channels of energy transfer are illucidated for these multiscale instabilities. Energy for the unified model is examined, including the injected, conservative redistribution (between fields and scales), and ultimate dissipation. Various physical mechanisms involved in the energetics are categorized as sources, sinks, nonlinear transfer, and coupling to show that the system satisfies the fundamental law of energy Oonservation. The physics of the nonlinear transfer terms is studied to identify their roles in producing <b>energy</b> <b>cascades</b> { the transference of energy from the dominant unstable wavenumbers and driving irregularities of different scale-lengths.

50|$|Kraichnan {{developed}} his turbulence theories over many decades {{and was one}} of the prominent American theorists in this area. From 1967 onwards, he maintained that for two-dimensional turbulence energy does not only dissipate itself from large scales (determined by the size of obstacles in the flow) to smaller ones as it does in three dimensions, but conversely that smaller fluctuations can increase in size. This theory is called the inverse <b>Energy</b> <b>Cascade,</b> and it is especially applicable to oceanography and meteorology, since flows on the surface of the earth are approximately two-dimensional. The theory was tested and confirmed in the 1980s by data gathered from weather balloons.|$|E
50|$|Vortex {{stretching}} is at {{the core}} of the description of the turbulence <b>energy</b> <b>cascade</b> from the large scales to the small scales in turbulence. In general, in turbulence fluid elements are more lengthened than squeezed, on average. In the end, this results in more vortex stretching than vortex squeezing. For incompressible flow—due to volume conservation of fluid elements—the lengthening implies thinning of the fluid elements in the directions perpendicular to the stretching direction. This reduces the radial length scale of the associated vorticity. Finally, at the small scales of the order of the Kolmogorov microscales, the turbulence kinetic energy is dissipated into heat through the action of molecular viscosity.|$|E

40|$|Incompressible {{turbulent}} flows {{were investigated}} {{in the framework}} of ideal magnetohydrodynamics. Equilibrium canonical distributions are determined in a phase whose coordinates are the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier coefficients for the field variables. The magnetic field and fluid velocity have variable x and y components, and all field quantities are independent of z. Three constants of the motion are found which survive the truncation in Fourier space and permit the construction of canonical distributions with three independent temperatures. Spectral densities are calculated. One of the more novel physical effects is the appearance of macroscopic structures involving long wavelength, self-generated, magnetic fields ("magnetic islands"). In the presence of finite dissipation, <b>energy</b> <b>cascades</b> to higher wave numbers can be accompanied by vector potential cascades to lower wave numbers, {{in much the same way}} that in the fluid dynamic case, <b>energy</b> <b>cascades</b> to lower wave numbers accompany entropy cascades to higher wave numbers...|$|R

Some literatures do not consider Taylor microscales as a characteristic length scale and consider the <b>energy</b> <b>cascade</b> to contain only {{the largest and}} smallest scales; while the latter accommodate both the inertial subrange and the viscous sublayer. Nevertheless, Taylor microscales are often used in describing the term “turbulence” more conveniently as these Taylor microscales play a dominant role in energy and momentum transfer in the wavenumber space.|$|E
5000|$|In his {{original}} theory of 1941, Kolmogorov postulated that for very high Reynolds numbers, the small scale turbulent motions are statistically isotropic (i.e. no preferential spatial direction could be discerned). In general, the large scales of a flow are not isotropic, {{since they are}} determined by the particular geometrical features of the boundaries (the size characterizing the large scales will be denoted as [...] ). Kolmogorov's idea was that in the Richardson's <b>energy</b> <b>cascade</b> this geometrical and directional information is lost, while the scale is reduced, so that the statistics of the small scales has a universal character: they are the same for all turbulent flows when the Reynolds number is sufficiently high.|$|E
50|$|Although it is {{possible}} to find some particular solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations governing fluid motion, all such solutions are unstable to finite perturbations at large Reynolds numbers. Sensitive dependence on the initial and boundary conditions makes fluid flow irregular both in time and in space so that a statistical description is needed. The Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov proposed the first statistical theory of turbulence, based on the aforementioned notion of the <b>energy</b> <b>cascade</b> (an idea originally introduced by Richardson) and the concept of self-similarity. As a result, the Kolmogorov microscales were named after him. It is now known that the self-similarity is broken so the statistical description is presently modified.

50|$|Following {{earlier work}} of Andrei Kolmogorov (1941), Lars Onsager (1945), Werner Heisenberg (1948), Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker {{and others on}} the {{statistical}} theory of turbulence, Kraichnan developed a field-theoretic approach to fluid flow in 1957 derived from approaches to the quantum many-body problem--- the Direct Interaction Approximation. In 1964/5, he recast this approach in the Lagrangian picture, discovering a scaling correction which he had earlier incorrectly ignored. The statistical theory of turbulence in viscous liquids describes the fluid flow by a scale-invariant distribution of the velocity field, which means that the typical size of the velocity as a function of wavenumber is a power-law. In steady state, larger scale eddies at long wavelengths disintegrate into smaller ones, dissipating their energy into smaller length scales. This type of dissipation is not caused by friction on the molecular level, but by the nonlinear effects of the Navier Stokes equations. In the final stages of the <b>energy</b> <b>cascade,</b> at the smallest length scales, the viscosity becomes important and the energy dissipates into heat.|$|E

50|$|Rotationality : Turbulent flows have non-zero {{vorticity}} and {{are characterized}} by a strong three-dimensional vortex generation mechanism known as vortex stretching. In fluid dynamics, they are essentially vortices subjected to stretching associated with a corresponding increase of the component of vorticity in the stretching direction—due to the conservation of angular momentum. On the other hand, vortex stretching is the core mechanism on which the turbulence <b>energy</b> <b>cascade</b> relies to establish the structure function. In general, the stretching mechanism implies thinning of the vortices in the direction perpendicular to the stretching direction due to volume conservation of fluid elements. As a result, the radial length scale of the vortices decreases and the larger flow structures break down into smaller structures. The process continues until the small scale structures are small enough that their kinetic energy can be transformed by the fluid's molecular viscosity into heat. This is why turbulence is always rotational and three dimensional. For example, atmospheric cyclones are rotational but their substantially two-dimensional shapes do not allow vortex generation and so are not turbulent. On the other hand, oceanic flows are dispersive but essentially non rotational and therefore are not turbulent.|$|E

Richardson has described the interplay between large and small scales and the phenomena so described are known as the Richardson cascade. This local interplay also forms the basis of a theory by Kolmogorov. In this letter, we use the explicit map method to analyze the nonlinear dynamical behavior for cascade in isotropic turbulence.
