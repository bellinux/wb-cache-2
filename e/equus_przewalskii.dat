The IL 26 gene is located between two other well-known cytokines genes of this family encoding interferon-gamma (IFNG) and IL 22 in an evolutionary conserved gene cluster. In contrast to humans and most other mammals, mice lack a functional Il 26 gene. We analyzed the genome sequences of other vertebrates for the presence or absence of functional IL 26 orthologs and found that the IL 26 gene has also become inactivated in several equid species.

Twenty-four descendants were naturally born, average reproduction rate was 38. 7 %, and average survival rate of foals was 69. 1 % in this interim. Frequent alternation of the leading stallion and infertility in female horses due to environmental factors were main causes for the low reproduction rate.

40|$|Historical finds of bone {{remains of}} Panthera leo spelaea (Goldfuss) from the Upper Pleistocene loess open air site at Praha-Podbaba (Czech Republic) are reviewed. The largely {{complete}} cranium from Central Bohemia and finds from other sites in Czech Republic are also described. The bone {{proportions of the}} cranial and postcranial material from Podbaba indicate them {{to have come from}} an adult male lion carcass. One foreleg and lower jaw belonged to an adult female as evidenced by their much smaller proportions. A few additional bones were found at other loess pits around Praha along the Vltava River and at open air sites along the Berounka River close to Beroun. By undertaking a preliminary overview of these finds and other bones from cave sites in Central Bohemia, a first palaeobiogeographical distribution of these extinct carnivores can be presented. The lion remains from the open air sites, were found alongside the typical glacial cold-period macrofauna consisting of a few Mammuthus primigenius (Blumenbach), but mainly Coelodonta antiquitatis (Blumenbach) bones, which were often well-chewed by Ice Age spotted hyenas. Other faunal remains were found in the loess sites, and these appeared, in most cases, to be hyena prey depots or scavenging sites. These remains included Bison priscus (Bojanus), Equus ferus Boddaert [partly <b>Equus</b> <b>przewalskii</b> (Poljakoff) ], Equus hemionus (Pallas), Rangifer tarandus (Linnaeus), Cervus elaphus Linnaeus, Capra ibex (Linnaeus) and rarely Rupricapra rupricapra (Linnaeus). The latter two animals indicate that an alpine fauna existed in Central Bohemia during the early and middle Upper Pleistocene. Some lion remains and locations described here may be of Saalian Age, during which a similar fauna existed. The bone accumulations, including lion remains, are probably, in many cases, hyena prey deposits. Their presence in caves seems to have been mainly the result of hyena and lion conflicts, and lion kills which were imported, often as complete carcasses, into the hyena cave dens such as the one at Srbsko Chlum-Komín. Their carcasses seemed to have very often been imported by hyenas into their dens in loess along the Weichselian river valleys, the Vltava and Berounka Rivers. In some cases, lions may have been killed at the conflict site, and been scavenged there. The proven minimum number of individuals (MNI) lions for the Weichselian in Central Bohemia can be estimated from cave and open air sites to be about 20 compared with a provable hyena MNI of more than twice this number at about 48 individuals...|$|E
40|$|The Przewalski horse (<b>Equus</b> <b>przewalskii)</b> is {{extinct in}} the wild, {{but has a}} current {{population}} of around 1300 animals housed in zoos and semi-reserves. As the ratio of births of males:females is about 1 : 1, males which are currently surplus {{to the requirements of}} the breeding program can be difficult to house. A group of 5 male Przewalskis was introduced to the study site at Eelmoor Marsh, South East England, (a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest) as part of an experimental scheme to help alleviate housing pressure in zoos and as an alternative to mowing to control the growth of invasive vegetation. We have investigated the eliminatory behaviour of this bachelor group and the distribution of faeces on the study site, as part of a series of observations of their social behaviour, grazing preferences and habitat use. The distribution of dung was measured and compared throughout the summer months using a transect method. This data, together with continuous observations of the horses during the same period, was used to determine whether defecation was random, avoided preferred grazing areas, or was contagious within specific latrine sites, as reported in domestic horses. Observations of eliminatory marking behaviour and the use of stud piles (communal mounds of faeces) by individual horses were made during summer and winter months to allow comparisons between seasons. Social status within the group had an effect on the marking behaviour of stallions. The dominant stallion displayed significantly more defecation marking behaviour (P< 0. 01) than the other mature male, and showed defecation marking behaviour more often in response to the dung of the subordinate mature stallion than to the dung of the juveniles (P< 0. 005 and P< 0. 05 respectively). The expression of marking behaviour by mature stallions was higher in the summer than the winter (P< 0. 005). Stud pile use occurred during both the summer and winter months, and was most prevalent in areas where it had a high-impact visual stimulus. These horses did not appear to show latrine behaviour as reported in domestic horses, although they did avoid grazing next to newly deposited faeces on stud piles in the summer. Dung which was not deposited on stud piles was distributed contagiously (P< 0. 05) across the study site, mainly along regularly used tracks. These data support the argument that latrine use in domestic horses may be a response to confinement...|$|E
40|$|This study {{looked at}} the grazing and {{defecation}} behaviour of a bachelor group of Przewalski horses (<b>Equus</b> <b>przewalskii),</b> which was established to explore the possibilities of using stallions to control invasive vegetation on contained Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The group, consisting of two mature stallions and three colts, was observed during summer (June - August) and winter (December - January) months under free-ranging conditions (46. 5 hectares). Four of the horses were also studied {{for a period of}} four weeks during August - September under enclosed conditions (2. 5 hectares). The objectives of the study were 1) to compare dung distribution with continuous behavioural observations to determine whether defecation was random, or whether the horses had latrine areas separate to their main grazing areas, and 2) to determine the effect of enclosure size on the defecation behaviour of these individuals. At each study site, a series of transects was walked and the number of defecations along their length was recorded at weekly intervals. Notes were made on the presence of stud piles and the grazed state of the sward. Behavioural observations were used to determine preferential grazing areas and to differentiate between random defecation, use of latrines and defecation in response to stud piles. The nature of dung distribution (e. g. random, regular or contagious) was determined by calculating a coefficient of variation for each transect. The results showed that dung was randomly distributed along most transects, with a contagious pattern of distribution occurring only on transects where stud piles were prevalent. During the summer months, there was a significant positive correlation (= 0. 799, P< 0. 0001, Spearman rank correlation) between the amount of dung present on a transect and the grazed state of the adjacent sward. Juveniles defecated whilst grazing 84 % of the time during the summer, and 96 % of the time during the winter under freeranging conditions. Under enclosed conditions, juveniles defecated whilst grazing 57 % of the time. Most defecations by mature stallions during the summer were in response to stud piles or occurred as a result of marking behaviour; 67 % of their defecations during the winter occurred randomly during periods of grazing. Latrine behaviour has been reported for domestic horses in small enclosures (Ödberg and Francis-Smith, 1977) and also for feral horses grazing on reseeded lawns during the summer in the New Forest (Putman et al, 1987). It has not been reported for other freeranging equids, and was originally thought to occur as a consequence of enclosure and insufficient foraging areas (though this does not explain its occurrence in the New Forest). The horses in this study showed random defecation under both free-ranging and enclosed conditions. This therefore, suggests another hypothesis - that latrine behaviour occurs as a consequence of increased animal density. The onset of this behaviour may occur either as a direct consequence of domestication, or through the breeding of individuals predisposed to show latrine use when animal density is high. This hypothesis may also explain the seasonality of latrine behaviour within the New Forest. References: Ödberg, F. O. and Francis-Smith, K. 1977.
