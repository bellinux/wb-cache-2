5|$|The <b>four</b> <b>types</b> {{of flower}} parts, namely carpels, stamens, petals, and sepals, are {{homologous}} with and derived from leaves, as Goethe correctly noted in 1790. The {{development of these}} parts through a pattern of gene expression in the growing zones (meristems) is described by the ABC model of flower development. Each of the <b>four</b> <b>types</b> of flower parts is serially repeated in concentric whorls, controlled by {{a small number of}} genes acting in various combinations. Thus, A genes working alone result in sepal formation; A and B together produce petals; B and C together create stamens; C alone produces carpels. When none of the genes are active, leaves are formed. Two more groups of genes, D to form ovules and E for the floral whorls, complete the model. The genes are evidently ancient, as old as the flowering plants themselves.|$|E

5|$|The two {{strands of}} DNA run in {{opposite}} directions {{to each other and}} are thus antiparallel. Attached to each sugar is one of <b>four</b> <b>types</b> of nucleobases (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription. Under the genetic code, these RNA strands are translated to specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation.|$|E
