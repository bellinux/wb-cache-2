5|$|Although {{perhaps not}} as {{prolific}} as {{other areas of}} Greece in regards to technological innovations, there are some inventions that may have originated <b>in</b> <b>Macedonia</b> aside from siege engines and artillery. The rotary-operated olive press for producing olive oil may have been invented in ancient Macedonia or another part of Greece, or even as far east as the Levant or Anatolia. Mold-pressed glass first appeared <b>in</b> <b>Macedonia</b> in the 4thcenturyBC (although it could have simultaneously existed in the Achaemenid Empire); the first known clear, translucent glass pieces of the Greek world have been discovered <b>in</b> <b>Macedonia</b> and Rhodes and date to {{the second half of}} the 4thcenturyBC. Greek technical and scientific literature began with Classical Athens in the 5thcenturyBC, while the major production centers for technical innovation and texts during the Hellenistic period were Alexandria, Rhodes, and Pergamon.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Skopje was in ruins. Most of the {{official}} buildings were restored or rebuilt, but the city experienced new plague and cholera epidemics and many inhabitants emigrated. The Ottoman Turkish Empire as a whole entered in recession and political decline. Many rebellions and pillages occurred <b>in</b> <b>Macedonia</b> during the 18th century, either led by Turkish outlaws, Janissaries or Hajduks. An estimation conducted by French officers around 1836 revealed that at that time Skopje only had around 10,000 inhabitants. It was largely overwhelmed by two towns of the present-day Republic of Macedonia: Bitola (40,000) and Štip (15–20,000).|$|E
5|$|All these controversies {{have led}} ethnic groups <b>in</b> <b>Macedonia</b> to use terms in {{conflicting}} ways. Despite {{the fact that}} these terms may not always be used in a pejorative way, they may be perceived as such by the ethnic group to which they are applied. Both Greeks and ethnic Macedonians generally use all terms deriving from Macedonia to describe their own regional or ethnic group, and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other side, or the region in general.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of Julius Caesar in 54BC, regular legionary units were {{supplemented}} by exploratores, a body of scouts, and speculatores, spies who infiltrated enemy camps. Due {{to the demands of}} the civil war, the extraordinary measure of recruiting legions from non-citizens was taken by Caesar in Transalpine Gaul (Latin: Gallia Transalpina), by Brutus <b>in</b> <b>Macedonia,</b> and by Pompey in Pharsalus. This irregular and extraordinary recruitment was not, however, typical of recruitment during this period, and Roman law still officially required that legions were recruited from Roman citizens only.|$|E
5|$|In 986, Basil II led a {{campaign}} with 30,000 soldiers. The commanders {{of the eastern}} armies did not {{take part in the}} campaign because they were fighting with the Arabs. The Byzantines marched from Odrin via Plovdiv to reach Sredets (Sofia). According to Leo Diaconus the objective of their Emperor was to subdue the Bulgarians with one strike. After the capture of Serdica which was a strategic fortress between the northeastern and southwestern Bulgarian lands Basil II intended to continue his campaign towards Samuil's main strongholds <b>in</b> <b>Macedonia.</b>|$|E
5|$|In late July 1918, Bulgarian {{commander-in-chief}} Nikola Zhekov sent German Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg {{a message}} regarding a rumored Entente offensive, and detailed Bulgaria's inability to adequately defend the Vardar {{portion of the}} front. Zhekov requested that Germany immediately reinforce the Balkan Front, hinting that Austria-Hungary would also be required to strengthen its positions in Albania. On 17 August, Hindenburg pledged to provide Bulgaria with support once the situation on other front permits it. Hindenburg's reluctance to support Bulgaria was also manifested by the early September redeployment of the last German Jäger battalion stationed <b>in</b> <b>Macedonia</b> back into Germany.|$|E

5|$|Music {{was also}} {{appreciated}} <b>in</b> <b>Macedonia.</b> In {{addition to the}} agora, the gymnasium, the theatre, and religious sanctuaries and temples dedicated to Greek gods and goddesses, {{one of the main}} markers of a true Greek city in the empire of Alexander the Great was the presence of an odeon for musical performances. This was the case not only for Alexandria in Egypt, but also cities as distant as Ai-Khanoum in what is now modern-day Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|The Pećanac Chetniks {{were named}} after their commander, Kosta Pećanac, {{who was a}} fighter and later vojvoda in the Serbian Chetnik Organization who had first {{distinguished}} himself in fighting against the Ottoman Empire <b>in</b> <b>Macedonia</b> between 1903 and 1910. In the First Balkan War, fought from October 1912 to May 1913, Pećanac served as a sergeant in the Royal Serbian Army. During the Second Balkan War, fought from 29 June to 10 August 1913, he saw combat against the Kingdom of Bulgaria. During World War I, he led bands of Serbian guerillas fighting behind Bulgarian and Austro-Hungarian lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{war ended}} with a peace treaty which {{confirmed}} the Bulgarian domination on the Balkans, restored the status of Bulgaria as a most favoured nation, abolished the commercial restrictions and obliged the Byzantine Empire to pay annual tribute. Under the treaty, the Byzantines also ceded an area between the Black Sea and Strandzha to Bulgaria. In exchange, the Bulgarians released the captured Byzantine soldiers and civilians, who were allegedly 120,000. The peace treaty remained in force until Leo VI's death in 912 although Simeon I did violate it following the Sack of Thessaloniki in 904, extracting further territorial concessions <b>in</b> <b>Macedonia.</b>|$|E

5|$|A poll {{following}} the 2008 summit showed that 82.5 percent of citizens surveyed opposed changing the constitutional name {{in order to}} join NATO. Elections were called {{following the}} 2008 summit, resulting in further support for the centre-right pro-NATO party, VMRO-DPMNE. The elections were marred by violence that was criticized by NATO members. Ethnic tensions have persisted <b>in</b> <b>Macedonia,</b> and NATO has called for dialogue following clashes {{such as those in}} the city of Kumanovo in 2015, which were blamed in part on the delay in NATO and European integration. NATO membership in general is supported by 81 percent according to a November 2014 poll. On 12 June 2017, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev signaled that he will consider alternatives names for the country in order to strike a compromise with Greece, settle the naming dispute, and lift Greek objections to Macedonia joining the alliance. Zaev also floated the idea of Macedonia joining the alliance under the provisional name it uses at the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|A {{war with}} Serbia in 1331–1334 proved less {{successful}} for the Emperor when several towns <b>in</b> <b>Macedonia</b> were {{captured by the}} Serbs, led by the renegade Syrgiannes Palaiologos. These gains were only curtailed when the assassination of Syrgiannes {{and the threat of}} a Hungarian invasion forced the Serbian ruler, Stefan Dušan, to seek a negotiated settlement. The subsequent peace treaty concluded between Andronikos III and Dušan was important for the future of Byzantine-Serbian relations. For the first time, the Byzantines recognized the extensive gains the Serbs had made at the Empire's expense in the central Balkans during Andronikos II's reign. In the aftermath of the pact, Dušan also moved his seat, and with it his realm's centre of gravity, south to Prilep.|$|E

When conflict erupted, Owumi was trapped in Mutassim Gaddafi's apartment without food or electricity for several days {{in the midst of}} the violence before crossing the border into Egypt, where he was arrested and detained. After his release, before returning home, he won the league championship with El-Olympi. Following his traumatic experience in Libya, he began competing in the BBL, firstly with the Worcester Wolves, with whom he won a league title, and then the London Lions and Surrey Scorchers.|$|E

5|$|After the {{creation}} of the provisional government in Thessaloniki, negotiations between the Allies and king intensified. The Allies wanted further demobilization of the Greek army and the removal of military forces from Thessaly to insure the safety of their troops <b>in</b> <b>Macedonia.</b> The king wanted assurances that the Allies would not officially recognize or support Venizelos' provisional government and guarantees that Greece's integrity and neutrality would be respected. After several unproductive negotiations, on 23 October the king suddenly agreed to some of the demands required by the Allies including the removal of the Greek army from Thessaly. The king also volunteered war materiel and the Greek navy to assist them. In exchange, the king requested French Deputy Paul Bénazet to keep this agreement secret from the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Perseus at Pydna in 168BC, the Roman Senate allowed the reopening of iron and copper mines, but forbade the mining of gold and silver by the four newly {{established}} autonomous client states that replaced the monarchy <b>in</b> <b>Macedonia.</b> The law may originally have been conceived by the Senate due to the fear that material wealth gained from gold and silver mining operations would allow the Macedonians to fund an armed rebellion. The Romans were perhaps also concerned with stemming inflation caused by an increased money supply from Macedonian silver mining. The Macedonians continued minting silver coins between 167 and 148BC (i.e. just before {{the establishment of the}} Roman province of Macedonia), and when the Romans lifted the ban on Macedonian silver mining in 158BC it may simply have reflected the local reality of this illicit practice continuing regardless of the Senate's decree.|$|E
5|$|At Lampsacus, John {{met with}} his brother, who rewarded his {{victories}} with the title of despotes, the second after the emperor himself in the Byzantine hierarchy, while his father-in-law Tornikes and his half-brother Constantine were raised to sebastokratores. Then, or sometime after, he was also given the islands of Rhodes and Lesbos as personal domains (pronoiai). In July 1261, Constantinople was recovered and the Byzantine Empire restored with Michael VIII as sole emperor. In the meantime, however, things had been going badly in Epirus, where Michael II had recovered his realm and was once again threatening imperial possessions <b>in</b> <b>Macedonia.</b> In 1261, John was sent on campaign against the Epirotes. After long and hard fighting, {{in the summer of}} 1263/1264 he achieved a major victory, which forced Michael II to come to terms: the Epirote ruler acknowledged imperial suzerainty, and his son and heir, Nikephoros, was married to Anna Palaiologina Kantakouzene, a niece of Michael VIII.|$|E

5|$|By the 5th century, {{structures}} with small-scale domed cross plans existed {{across the}} Christian world. Examples include the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia, the martyrium {{attached to the}} Basilica of San Simpliciano, and churches <b>in</b> <b>Macedonia</b> and {{on the coast of}} Asia Minor. Small brick domes are also found in towers of Constantinople's early 5th century land walls. Underground cisterns in Constantinople, such as the Cistern of Philoxenos and the Basilica Cistern, were composed of a grid of columns supporting small domes, rather than groin vaults. The square bay with an overhead sail vault or dome on pendentives became the basic unit of architecture in the early Byzantine centuries, found in a variety of combinations.|$|E
5|$|From 20 to 24 February, Gočeva held five concerts at the Macedonian Opera and Ballet (MOB) {{during which}} she {{performed}} songs from Makedonsko Devojče 2 live for the first time. The concertgoers {{were the first to}} receive copies of the album along with their tickets which were put on sale on 9 December 2013. In 2014, 15,000 tickets were sold for Gočeva's concerts in Skopje. In January 2014, a listening party for the album was held at the club XO in Skopje on which Gočeva was also present; the event represented the first of such kind <b>in</b> <b>Macedonia</b> and according to Gočeva, the inspiration for it came from a similar trend popular across the world where the artist and the team working behind the album listen to the full final version of the project together with a group of fans and music journalists.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Gočeva {{released}} the album Makedonsko Devojče {{in collaboration with}} Macedonian composer Zlatko Origjanski.

Makedonsko Devojče turned out to be a commercial and critical success, becoming the best-selling album <b>in</b> <b>Macedonia</b> in the year of its release and receiving the award for Best World Music Album at the 2008 Sunčane Skale festival in Montenegro.
