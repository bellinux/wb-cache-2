Design/methodology/approach: Specimens (rode 30 mm × ø 1 mm) were to give in to the surface treatment – mechanically polishing, electrolytic polishing and passivation with various parameter. Electrochemical investigations concerning the corrosion resistance of austenitic steel samples were carried out by means of the potentiodynamic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy method.

40|$|Redox flow {{batteries}} (RFBs) {{can be used}} {{to store}} energy on the large and medium scale (kW – MW), particularly in applications such as load levelling of electrical power supplies, power quality control application and facilitating renewable energy deployment. In this thesis, the development of a divided and undivided zinc-cerium redox flow battery from its fundamental chemistry in aqueous methanesulfonic acid has been described. This comprehensive investigation has focused on the selection of electrode materials, evaluation of zinc corrosion of the negative electrode, characterization of the redox flow battery and the cycling performance. Voltammetric studies of both the zinc and the cerium half-cell reactions have been carried out under various operating conditions and for electrolyte compositions. These studies suggested that the positive electrode reaction could limit the use of higher current densities. After testing a range of two- and three-dimensional positive electrode materials, only three-dimensional platinised titanium mesh and carbon felts were capable of discharge at 50 mA cm- 2 with high charge (> 70 %) and voltage (> 60 %) efficiencies in an divided system based on the optimum electrolyte compositions obtained in the half-cell studies. In order to avoid the diffusion of protons across the membrane and to simplify the construction, an undivided, membraneless system was proposed. With specific design arrangement and carbon felt positive electrode, this system can operate at room temperature with a high energy efficiency (~ 75 %) instead of 60 oC as reported in the patented system in the literature. In order to facilitate zinc electrodeposition and prevent zinc <b>corrosion,</b> several <b>electrolytic</b> additives and <b>corrosion</b> inhibitors have been suggested.

The London Underground is the largest of these, (see railway {{electrification}} in Great Britain).

50|$|A {{problem with}} all the {{aforementioned}} cables, when passing current, is that <b>electrolytic</b> <b>corrosion</b> can occur in the connections unless moisture and air are excluded. Consequently, various solutions to exclude moisture have been proposed. The first was to seal the connection by wrapping it with self-amalgamating rubberised tape, which bonds to itself when activated by stretching. The second proposal, by the American Channel Master company (now owned by Andrews corp.) at least as early as 1999, was to apply silicone grease to the wires making connection. The third proposal was to fit a self-sealing plug to the cable. All of these methods are reasonably successful if implemented correctly.|$|E

5000|$|A {{variant of}} the octal base, the B8G loctal base or lock-in base (sometimes spelled [...] "loktal" [...] - trademarked by Sylvania), was {{developed}} by Sylvania for ruggedized applications such as automobile radios. Along with B8B (a British designation out of date by 1958), these eight-pin locking bases are almost identical and the names usually taken as interchangeable (although there are some minor differences in specifications, such as spigot material and spigot taper, etc.). The pin geometry {{was the same as}} for octal, but the pins were thinner (although they will fit into a standard octal socket, they wobble and do not make good contact), the base shell was made of aluminium, and the center hole had an electrical contact that also mechanically locked (hence [...] "loctal") the tube in place. Loctal tubes were only used widely by a few equipment manufacturers, most notably Philco, which used the tubes in many table radios. Loctal tubes have a small indexing mark {{on the side of the}} base skirt; they do not release easily from their sockets unless pushed from that side. Because the pins are actually the Fernico or Cunife lead-out wires from the tube itself, they are prone to intermittent connections caused by the build-up of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>corrosion</b> products due to the pin being of a different metallic composition to the socket contact.|$|E
