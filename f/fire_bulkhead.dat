50|$|Brazils {{fireproofing}} {{was completely}} revised. <b>Fire</b> screen <b>bulkheads,</b> with and <b>fire</b> doors controlled from her bridge, divided her into 12 fire zones. She was {{fitted with a}} fire sprinkler system, and her water intakes were fitted with filters that would allow her to draw water from the muddy bottoms of South American harbors.|$|R
50|$|The Paixhans gun (French: Canon Paixhans) was {{the first}} naval gun using {{explosive}} shells. It was developed by French general Henri-Joseph Paixhans in 1822-1823 by combining the flat trajectory of a gun with an explosive shell that could rip apart and set on <b>fire</b> the <b>bulkheads</b> of enemy warships. The Paixhans gun ultimately doomed the wooden sailship, and forced {{the introduction of the}} ironclad after the Battle of Sinop in 1853.|$|R
5000|$|At 08:25, an {{explosion}} {{in one of the}} [...] "Fancy" [...] torpedoes (but not the warhead) burst the number-three torpedo tube into which it had been loaded and ruptured the forward-most two watertight <b>bulkheads.</b> <b>Fire,</b> toxic gases, and smoke accompanied the blast. Twelve men in the forward compartments died instantly and seven others were seriously injured.|$|R
50|$|Hazel Kirk Mine No. 2, {{owned by}} the Pittsburg and Westmoreland Coal Company, {{was the site of}} two fatal explosions in October 1905. On October 10, 1905 the first {{underground}} explosion, related to a dynamite blast, killed two miners, the brothers John and Mike Kusko. A <b>fire</b> resulted; temporary <b>bulkheads</b> were erected to isolate the flames and the burning section of the mine was flooded with water.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the captain}} {{learned of the}} fire, he {{attempted}} to close the <b>bulkhead</b> <b>fire</b> doors on Deck 3. The fire doors were not configured for fully automatic closing and did not respond since emergency alarms near the doors had not been manually triggered by passengers or crew. A vehicle storage area ventilated by large fans to remove exhaust fumes was also located nearby, and the fans pulled air through an improperly secured fire door and caused rapid fire progress from Deck 3 through Deck 4 and Deck 5 via stairways located on either end.|$|R
50|$|On 7 April 1989, {{while under}} the command of Captain 1st Rank Evgeny Vanin and running {{submerged}} at a depth of 335 m about 180 km southwest of Bear Island (Norway), fire broke out in the engine room due to a short-circuit, and even though watertight doors were shut, the resulting <b>fire</b> spread through <b>bulkhead</b> cable penetrations. The reactor scrammed and propulsion was lost. Electrical problems spread as cables burned through, and control of the boat was threatened. An emergency ballast tank blow was performed and the submarine surfaced eleven minutes after the fire began. Distress calls were made, and most of the crew abandoned ship.|$|R
500|$|The armour of the barbettes {{constituted}} a major weakness in Agincourts protection. They were 9 inches thick above {{the upper deck}} level, but decreased to 3 inches between the upper and main decks and had no armour at all below the main deck except for [...] "Sunday" [...] barbette (which had 3 inches), and [...] "Thursday" [...] and [...] "Saturday" [...] barbettes (which had 2 inches). The turret armour was 12 inches thick on the face, [...] {{on the side and}} [...] in the rear. The turret roofs were 3 inches thick at the front and 2 inches at the rear. The casemates for the secondary armament were protected by 6 inches of armour and were defended from raking <b>fire</b> by 6-inch-thick <b>bulkheads.</b>|$|R
40|$|The new C- 5 M engine pylon was {{subjected}} to live fire testing {{as part of the}} overall C- 5 RERP Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E) program. The pylon was designed, as much as possible, to physically separate the flammable fluid carrying lines from the ignition sources. This was done by routing the flammable fluid carrying lines through the structural box while the ignition sources are routed from the engine core compartment to the wing/pylon interface through the pylon leading edge. Designed into the pylon are fire resistant materials for structure, hydraulics, fuel, and bleed air lines. The pylon also provides fluid drain lines for potential flammable fluid line fitting leaks, and ventilation in flammable fluid areas. Twelve ballistic shots were performed on this unique, orthogrid construction engine pylon. The objective was to determine the ignition and sustained fire potential by impacting two dry bays within the engine pylon. The bays of interest are Zone 2 – “Wing Interface Compartment (Fire Zone) ” and Zone 3 – “Structural Box Compartment (Flammable Fluids Zone) ”. Zone 2, enclosed by Aluminum 2219 -T 81 skin, contains fuel and hydraulic lines, an ECS duct, wire bundles, <b>fire</b> resistant <b>bulkhead</b> seals, a 5 -min – 2000 ˚F fire-resistant bulkhead, and drainage. Zone 3, enclosed b...|$|R
5000|$|Hardshell is {{the fiercest}} of the Insecticons who first appears in [...] "Toxicity." [...] When Megatron asks the Insecticons {{which of them}} is the strongest of them, Hardshell states that the Insecticons are equal but he is the fiercest. Hardshell is ordered by Megatron to find the fourth and final {{artifact}} from the Iacon Vault, and leads some Insecticons to the Equator to locate the artifact. Bulkhead encounters and fights Hardshell, who knows the Wreckers due to killing some of its members. Hardshell proves to be a match for Bulkhead until he is knocked down, but leaves Bulkhead leaking Energon. Hardshell recovers and states that Bulkhead leaving him alive will be the last mistake he'll ever make. When Bulkhead finds the Iacon artifact, which {{turns out to be a}} cache of Tox-En (a type of deadly and poisonous Energon), Hardshell catches up and one of the Insecticons with him ends up killed by a combination of Bulkhead's grenade and some Tox-En. Hardshell reports to Megatron that they are after the Tox-En in the artifact and then goes after Bulkhead by following his leaked Energon trail. When Hardshell learns that Bulkhead's trail is fake and confronts the Autobot on the volcano summit, demanding the severely weakened Bulkhead to let them put him out of his misery. Bulkhead managed to expose Hardshell and his remaining Insecticons to Tox-En, weakening them, and Hardshell is knocked down a volcano shaft with the Tox-En, but survives and soon emerges to <b>fire</b> on <b>Bulkhead</b> as he heads into the Ground Bridge.|$|R
6000|$|The Spaniards, ere {{five minutes}} had passed, poured en masse into the Rose's waist, {{but only to}} their destruction. Between the poop and {{forecastle}} (as was then the fashion) the upper-deck beams were left open and unplanked, {{with the exception of}} a narrow gangway on either side; and off that fatal ledge the boarders, thrust on by those behind, fell headlong between the beams to the main-deck below, to be slaughtered helpless in that pit of destruction, by the double <b>fire</b> from the <b>bulkheads</b> fore and aft; while the few who kept their footing on the gangway, after vain attempts to force the stockades on poop and forecastle, leaped overboard again amid a shower of shot and arrows. The fire of the English was as steady as it was quick; and though three-fourths of the crew had never smelt powder before, they proved well the truth of the old chronicler's saying (since proved again more gloriously than ever, at Alma, Balaklava, and Inkerman), that [...] "the English never fight better than in their first battle." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{island was}} {{completely}} redesigned, made taller, but shorter in overall length with {{the removal of}} its gun mounts. In addition, the boiler uptakes were rebuilt and angled aft to accommodate a single radar and communications mast atop the island. To better protect aircrews, ready rooms were moved from the gallery deck to below the armored hangar deck, with a large escalator on the starboard side amidships to move flight crews up to the flight deck. Internally, aviation fuel capacity was increased to 300000 gal (a 50% increase) and its pumping capacity enhanced to 50 gal per minute. Fire fighting capabilities were enhanced through the addition of two emergency <b>fire</b> and splinter <b>bulkheads</b> to the hangar deck, a fog/foam firefighting system, improved water curtains and a cupronickel fire main. Also improved were electrical generating power, and weapons stowage and handling facilities. All this added considerable weight: displacement increased by some twenty percent. The armor belt was removed and blisters were fitted to the hull sides to compensate, widening waterline beam by 8 to 10 ft. The ships also sat lower in the water, and maximum speed was slightly reduced, to 31 kn.|$|R
