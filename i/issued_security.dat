25|$|At 5:00pm EDT on October 25, William Clements {{announced}} that the missiles in Cuba were still actively being worked on. That report was later verified by a CIA report that suggested {{there had been no}} slowdown at all. In response, Kennedy <b>issued</b> <b>Security</b> Action Memorandum 199, authorizing the loading of nuclear weapons onto aircraft under the command of SACEUR, which had the duty of carrying out first air strikes on the Soviet Union. During the day, the Soviets responded to the blockade by turning back 14 ships that were presumably carrying offensive weapons.|$|E

5000|$|The United Nations has <b>issued</b> <b>Security</b> Council Resolutions that {{declared}} some wars to {{be legal}} actions under international law, most notably Resolution 678, authorizing the 1991 Gulf War which {{was triggered by}} Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. UN Resolutions authorise the use of [...] "force" [...] or [...] "all necessary means".|$|E
50|$|While holding US Treasuries, one {{may wish}} to hold only the most {{recently}} <b>issued</b> <b>security</b> of a given maturity, the so-called on-the-run security. Thus, if one has purchased the on-the-run 30-year treasury and a new 30-year auction occurs, one may sell the old treasury, which is now off-the-run, and purchase the new on-the-run treasury.|$|E
50|$|In finance, an {{on the run}} {{security}} or contract is the most recently issued, and hence most liquid, of a periodically <b>issued</b> <b>security.</b> On the run securities are generally more liquid and trade at a premium to other securities. Other, older issues {{are referred to as}} off the run securities, and trade at a discount to on the run securities.|$|E

50|$|In {{military}} and government organizations, and some private organizations, {{a system of}} compartmenting information exists to prevent the uncontrolled dissemination of information considered to be sensitive or confidential. Persons with a legitimate need {{to have access to}} such information are <b>issued</b> <b>security</b> clearances, which can be tracked and verified to ensure that no unauthorized persons gain access to protected information.|$|E
50|$|Overcollateralization (OC) is a {{commonly}} used form of credit enhancement. With this support structure, the face {{value of the}} underlying loan portfolio {{is larger than the}} security it backs, thus the <b>issued</b> <b>security</b> is overcollateralized. In this manner, even if some of the payments from the underlying loans are late or default, principal and interest payments on the ABS (asset-backed security) can still be made.|$|E
5000|$|The {{excess spread}} is the {{difference}} between the interest rate received on the underlying collateral and the coupon on the <b>issued</b> <b>security.</b> It is typically one of the first defenses against loss. Even if some of the underlying loan payments are late or default, the coupon payment can still be made. In the process of [...] "turboing", excess spread is applied to outstanding classes as principal.|$|E

Instead, on 10 July 2012 (which is in the intervening time between the last beta of Windows 8 and its final release), Microsoft <b>issued</b> <b>security</b> advisory to disable Sidebar and Desktop Gadgets on Windows Vista and 7 because of a security vulnerability that could allow remote code execution.|$|E
50|$|Dr. El-Ganayni’s work at Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory {{required}} {{the possession of}} a Department of Energy (DOE) <b>issued</b> <b>security</b> clearance, enabling him to work with classified information. In October 2007 El-Ganayni’s security clearance was suspended, effectively barring him from any work at Bettis. DOE regulations stipulate that an individual may appeal a suspension, however El-Ganayni’s right to appeal was denied in May 2008 when Jeffery F. Kupfer, deputy secretary of the DOE, invoked national security, refusing to reveal the government’s allegations against Dr. El-Ganayni.|$|E

25|$|Investment banks offer {{services}} to both corporations <b>issuing</b> <b>securities</b> and investors buying securities. For corporations, investment bankers offer information on {{when and how}} to place their securities on the open market, an activity very important to an investment bank's reputation. Therefore, investment bankers play a very important role in <b>issuing</b> new <b>security</b> offerings.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{delays in}} being <b>issued</b> <b>security</b> {{clearance}} for the NDPP position, Nxasana maintained {{that he was}} fit for the office. His security clearance was eventually denied for failing to disclose that in 1985 he had been tried on a murder charge, {{of which he was}} acquitted on grounds of self-defence. He did however declare two convictions for assault. On 5 July 2014, President Zuma announced an inquiry to determine whether Nxasana is fit and proper to hold office in terms of section 12(6)(a)(iv) of the National Prosecuting Authority Act, 1998.|$|E
5000|$|This {{is a way}} of distributing a newly <b>issued</b> <b>security,</b> such as {{stocks or}} bonds, to investors. A {{syndicate}} of banks (the lead managers) underwrites the transaction, which means they have taken on the risk of distributing the securities. Should they not be able to find enough investors, they will have to hold some securities themselves. Underwriters make their income from the price difference (the [...] "underwriting spread") between the price they pay the issuer and what they collect from investors or from broker-dealers who buy portions of the offering.|$|E
50|$|From November 2005 to July 2007, the Rafah Crossing was jointly {{controlled}} by Egypt and the Palestinian Authority, with the European Union monitoring Palestinian compliance on the Gaza side. The Crossing operated daily until June 2006. Israel <b>issued</b> <b>security</b> warnings, thus preventing European monitors from travelling to the terminal. The Hamas-led PA Government threatened on 23 June {{to terminate the}} Rafah border-crossing agreement if the border would not be reopened. On 25 June 2006, terrorists attacked the Kerem Shalom Crossing Point and captured the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. The Crossing was infrequently reopened after this attack.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Citibank {{introduced}} a new structure for credit card-backed securities, called an issuance trust, which does not have limitations that master trusts sometimes do, that requires each <b>issued</b> series of <b>securities</b> to have both a senior and subordinate tranche. [...] There are other benefits to an issuance trust: they provide more flexibility in <b>issuing</b> senior/subordinate <b>securities,</b> can increase demand because pension funds are eligible to invest in investment-grade <b>securities</b> <b>issued</b> by them, and they can significantly {{reduce the cost of}} <b>issuing</b> <b>securities.</b> [...] Because of these issues, issuance trusts are now the dominant structure used by major issuers of credit card-backed securities.|$|R
50|$|Governments create debt by <b>issuing</b> <b>securities,</b> {{government}} bonds and bills. Less creditworthy countries sometimes borrow {{directly from a}} supranational organization (e.g. the World Bank) or international financial institutions.|$|R

50|$|Both ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and ISO/IEC 27002 are revised by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27 {{every few}} years {{in order to keep}} them current and relevant. Revision involves, for instance, {{incorporating}} references to other <b>issued</b> <b>security</b> standards (such as ISO/IEC 27000, ISO/IEC 27004 and ISO/IEC 27005) and various good security practices that have emerged in the field since they were last published. Due to the significant 'installed base' of organizations already using ISO/IEC 27002, particularly in relation to the information security controls supporting an ISMS that complies with ISO/IEC 27001, any changes have to be justified and, wherever possible, evolutionary rather than revolutionary in nature.|$|E

The United Nations requested member states to freeze the financial assets of those individuals. He was one of the individuals who were sanctioned. He {{was also one of the}} four former Taliban leaders that accepted the reconciliation offer from the Afghan government. He was also named deputy leader of Khuddamul Furqan for political affairs.|$|E
50|$|On Tuesday, March 14, 2017, Microsoft <b>issued</b> <b>security</b> {{bulletin}} MS17-010, which {{detailed the}} flaw {{and announced that}} patches had been released for all Windows versions that were currently supported at that time, these being Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2016, as well as Windows Vista (which had recently ended support). Many Windows users had not installed the patches when, two months later on May 12, 2017, the WannaCry ransomware attack used the EternalBlue vulnerability to spread itself.
