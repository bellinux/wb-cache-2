50|$|Bikowsky was {{a senior}} staff member at the Bin Laden <b>Issue</b> <b>Station</b> in January 2000. She was the direct {{supervisor}} of Michael Anne Casey, a woman CIA staff operations officer who was assigned to track future 9/11 hijacker Khalid al-Mihdhar at an al-Qaeda operatives' meeting in Malaysia in early January 2000. Casey blocked a draft cable written by Doug Miller, a FBI agent detailed to the Bin Laden <b>Issue</b> <b>Station,</b> to the FBI warning that al-Mihdhar had a multiple-entry visa for travel to the U.S. Mark Rossini, another FBI agent first assigned to the Bin Laden <b>Issue</b> <b>Station</b> in 1999, testified that Casey also verbally ordered him to not share information with FBI headquarters about al-Mihdhar or Nawaf al-Hazmi, who was traveling with al-Mihdhar. Rossini further stated that Bikowsky told congressional investigators in 2002 that she hand-delivered al-Mihdhar's visa information to FBI headquarters. This was later proven false by FBI log books.

50|$|In January 1996, the CTC {{opened the}} Bin Laden <b>Issue</b> <b>Station</b> to track Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda, with Michael Scheuer, {{formerly}} {{in charge of}} the CTC's Islamic Extremist Branch, as its first head.

The new Station, unlike the traditional country-based ones, was not geographically limited, and drew its personnel from across the U.S. intelligence community.|$|R
500|$|The {{chief of}} the base, Jennifer Lynne Matthews, 45 and a mother of three, started {{tracking}} al-Qaeda before the September 11 attacks.

5000|$|While {{the initial}} implementation, the Bin Laden <b>Issue</b> <b>Station,</b> {{did not work}} well, {{there has been an}} Intelligence Community effort to avoid the {{problems}} of stovepiping, especially where it involves lack of communication between analysts and operators.

He also believed that CIA pressure and practical interest was causing the USAF's armed Predator program to be significantly accelerated.
