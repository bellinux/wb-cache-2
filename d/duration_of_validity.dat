5000|$|The World Passport is a 45-page {{document}} {{sold by the}} World Service Authority, {{a non-profit}} organization, citing Article 13, Section 2, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. World Passports have allegedly been accepted sporadically by some 174 countries, but no immigration authority has a de facto or de jure policy of acceptance {{with regards to the}} document. The latest edition of the World Passport, which has been on sale since January 2007, is an MRD (machine readable document) with an alphanumeric code bar enabling computer input plus an embedded [...] "ghost" [...] photo for security, printing overcovered with a plastic film. The passport is in 7 languages: English, French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Simplified Chinese and Esperanto. Two covers are available: [...] "World Passport", and [...] "World Government Passport" [...] (for registered World Citizens), ("passport" [...] is in 7 languages on both covers). The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> is either 8 years, 5 years or 3 years. Other documents sold by the WSA include a World Birth Certificate, a World Political Asylum Card, a World Marriage Certificate, and a World Identity Card. Each page within the document is numbered and each page has the World Citizen logo in the background. There are two pages for affiliation with companies, organizations, and firms. There are nineteen visa pages in the document. On the back cover there are spaces for personal information such as a person’s home address.|$|E

5000|$|The TR Pass (...) is a rail pass {{offered by}} Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA), {{granting}} holders of the pass unlimited rides on trains operated by TRA within the day count. The pass {{can be used}} by both local and foreign travelers, and different <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> are offered as choice. There are two versions of the pass, i.e. the General Pass and the Student Pass.

This paper describes a concept of an analysis framework to improve the localisation and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> of flood inundation maps. The two-dimensional finite difference model TrimR 2 D is used and linked to a Monte-Carlo routine for parameter sampling {{as well as to}} selected performance measures. The purpose is the investigation of the impact of different spatial resolutions and the influence of changing land uses in the simulation of flood inundation areas. The technical assembling of the framework is realised and beside the model calibration, first tests with different parameter ranges were done. Preliminary results show good correlations with observed data, but the investigation of shifting land uses reflects only poor changes in the flood extension...|$|E
40|$|As part of {{the global}} {{economic}} activity growth, {{a great number of}} companies have expanded their business to include operations and offices in foreign countries. For the purpose of maintaining close supervision of the management of foreign business activities, many companies open a representative office in other countries. With the emergence of foreign investment and business in Indonesia, many foreign investors need land for buildings for their company. However, Indonesian Land Law is quite different to the laws that are applicable in most other countries. The Law Number 5 of 1960 and its numerous implementing regulations are the basic law applicable in Indonesia onrights over land ownership. The Basic Agrarian Law specifies several types of land rights, all of which offer the right to utilize the land concerned. Differences exist in <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity,</b> nature of utilization, possibility to mortgage and proof in title. Only Indonesian citizens are allowed to own land in Indonesia with freehold title. Foreign ownership of property is an interesting issue. Foreigners who wish to use or purchase land for whatever purpose {{need to be aware of}} these facts and not assume that the legal conventions that apply in their countries would necessarily apply in Indonesia. There are restrictions on foreign ownership of property in Indonesia and that an amendment of Government Regulation Number 41 of 1996 extends foreign property ownership and eases restrictions. This measure improves competition in the Indonesian housing market, foreigners in Indonesia benefit by improved access to real estate and it is likely to attract more Foreign Direct Investment into Indonesia...|$|E

The tickets are of two main types, single ticket and travel cards, both allowing for unlimited travel with SL in the entire Stockholm County for the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the ticket <b>validity.</b> On 1 April 2007, a zone system (A, B, C) and price system was introduced. Single tickets were available in forms of cash ticket, individual unit pre-paid tickets, pre-paid ticket slips of 8, sms-ticket and machine ticket. Cash tickets bought {{at the point of}} travel were the most expensive and pre-paid tickets slips of 8 are the cheapest. A single ticket is valid for 75 minutes. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the travel card validity depended on the exact type; they were available from 24 hours up to a year. A 30-day card costs 790SEK (83EUR; 130USD). Tickets of all these types were available with reduced prices for students and persons under 20 and over 65 years of age.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{describes}} the psychometric characteristics, <b>validity</b> and reliability <b>of</b> the {{revised version of}} the perceptions of care adjective checklist (PCACL-R) with women who had recently given birth. Data were collected from {{a national survey of}} women's experiences of maternity care (n = 2960). METHODS: Internal consistency, predictive validity, convergent validity, discriminant validity and confirmatory factor analyses were applied to the data. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis revealed an excellent fit to a bi-dimensional structure entirely consistent with the negative and positive valencing of adjectives in the measure, supporting the use of the instrument as a two subscale tool comprising positive and negative subscales. The PCACL-R revealed good convergent <b>validity</b> against measures <b>of</b> satisfaction with care and excellent divergent validity characteristics assessed against <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> labour. Discriminant <b>validity</b> was assessed against measures of area-based maternal deprivation, partner status and type of delivery. These analyses revealed commendable discriminant <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the PCACL-R. Internal consistency characteristics of the positive and negative subscales of the PCACL-R were acceptable. The predictive <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the PCACL-R was also found to be excellent. CONCLUSION: The PCACL-R is consequently recommended as a valid, reliable, respondent acceptable and easy to administer instrument to assess women's experiences of their care during labour and childbirth. The measurement characteristics of the PCACL-R suggest that the tool could be incorporated into both clinical and research contexts with confidence. The checklist terms used are applicable to other phases of maternity care and indeed {{to a wide range of}} health care contexts. Exploratory use in with other user groups is recommended...|$|R
40|$|A {{dynamical}} guiding-center {{simulation model}} {{is used to}} study the stormtime ion transport {{which leads to the}} formation of the ring current and diffusion in the radiation belts.

The present numerical results are compared with previously formulated limiting idealization of particle transport in order to assess the limits <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> these approximations. For ions having drift periods that exceed the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the main phase of the storm, their inward transport to form the stormtime ring current is appropriately described as direct convective access. For ions having drift periods comparable to the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the main phase of the storm, there is a transition between direct convective access and transport that resembles radial diffusion. Lower-energy ring-current ions at L of about 3 are freshly injected there from open adiabatic trajectories, whereas the higher-energy ring-current population consists of a mixture of freshly injected and previously trapped ions...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to explore the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the Time-Temperature-Stress Superposition Principle (TTSSP) to describe the creep behaviour of glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) pultruded beams. For this purpose, an experimental programme, including both short- and long-term creep tests, has been carried out. A total of twenty pultruded GFRP beams have been tested in a 4 -point bending scheme. Tests have been conducted at controlled room temperature (26 °C, 32 °C, 41 °C) and prescribed percentage of the ultimate load (26 %, 35 %, 45 %). Findley’s law {{has been used to}} interpret the results of the short-term experiments. Then, the TTSSP has been applied to build a master curve, usable to predict the results of long-term experiments.

40|$|Since {{the seminal}} work of Zhou Chaochen, M. R. Hansen, and P.

While this was formerly taken as an indication that key-press verification of implementations with respect to elaborate DC specifications were also impossible, we show that model-checking realistic designs is nevertheless feasible. The key issue is that the classical undecidability results rely on a notion <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> a formula that refers to a class of models which is considerably richer than the possible behaviours of embedded real-time systems: that of finitely variable trajectories. By analyzing two suitably sparser model classes we obtain model-checking procedures for rich subsets <b>of</b> <b>Duration</b> Calculus.

40|$|A long <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> {{computer}} use {{is known to}} be positively associated with Work Related Upper Extremity Disorders (WRUED). Self-report by questionnaire is commonly used to assess a worker's <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> {{computer use}}. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> self-report and computer use software (WorkPace®) to assess the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> computer use in a heterogeneous office population and for different job types. Ninety-nine bank employees with various job titles participated in the study. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> computer use was assessed simultaneously by self-report (questionnaire), WorkPace® and direct observation. Observation was regarded as the golden standard. On average, self-reports overestimated the observed <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> computer use with 39 %. This overestimation was reduced to 9 % when using WorkPace®. Viewing times (time viewing the screen without touching mouse or keyboard) differed between computer jobs. It was concluded that computer use statistics yield rather accurate estimations <b>of</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> computer use, whereas self-reports do not. These estimations can be further improved by using specific viewing time estimations for different computer jobs. Relevance to industry: To develop guidelines for safe <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> computer use and to assess high-risk groups, valid but simple exposure assessment methods are needed. Computer use software proves to be more valid than self-reports by questionnaire that are commonly used. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|For many {{learning}} tasks the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> {{the data}} collection can be greater than the time scale for changes of the underlying data distribution. The question we ask is how to include the information that data are aging. Ad hoc methods to achieve this include the use <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> windows that prevent the learning machine from making inferences based on old data. This introduces {{the problem of how}} to define the size <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> windows. In this brief, a new adaptive Bayesian inspired algorithm is presented for learning drifting concepts. It uses the analogy <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> windows in an adaptive Bayesian way to incorporate changes in the data distribution over time. We apply a theoretical approach based on information geometry to the classification problem and measure its performance in simulations. The uncertainty about the appropriate size of the memory windows is dealt with in a Bayesian manner by integrating over the distribution of the adaptive window size. Thus, the posterior distribution of the weights may develop algebraic tails. The learning algorithm results from tracking the mean and variance of the posterior distribution of the weights. It was found that the algebraic tails of this posterior distribution give the learning algorithm the ability to cope with an evolving environment by permitting the escape from local traps.

40|$|Purpose : To {{examine whether}} {{physical}} activity logbooks influence estimates <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> 7 -d recall physical activity questionnaires. Methods : A  {{convenience sample of}} 551 adults aged 18 – 75 yr wore an MTI  accelerometer for seven consecutive days and were then randomly administered two of four 7 -d recall physical activity questionnaires that varied in length and format (Active Australia Survey (AAS), long and short  International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ-L and IPAQ-S), and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)). A subsample of 75 % concurrently completed a physical activity logbook. Results : Correlations (rho) between self-reported and measured <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity and total activity were similar among participants who received a logbook {{and those who did}} not for each of the four instruments. There was also no interaction between assessment method (survey, accelerometer) and the assignment of a logbook. For the IPAQ-L, however, variability in the difference between accelerometer data and responses to the vigorous items was smaller among those assigned a logbook (F = 4. 128, df = 260, P = 0. 043). Overall, there were no differences in percent agreement or kappa for participation in sufficient levels of physical activity according to receipt of a logbook for any of the surveys. Conclusion : The process of self-monitoring through completion of a logbook does not appear to influence estimates <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> for brief or long questionnaires with global questions. Whereas the magnitude of error in accuracy of recall of particular types of activity may be reduced by completion of a logbook that is similar in structure to the survey being validated, this does not appear to influence overall estimates <b>of</b> <b>validity.</b> <br /...|$|R
