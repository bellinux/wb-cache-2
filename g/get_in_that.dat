[...] "I was kind of doing the {{opposite}} — being nonchalant and doing other stuff and not having a routine. You <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> physical routine that just makes you ready mentally. You trick yourself into knowing that it's game time and time to play." [...] Kyle Dubas, assistant GM of the Toronto Marlies cited Emery for his mentorship towards the team.

500|$|McConaughey and Harrelson {{were among}} a small pool of actors {{considered}} suitable candidates for top billing. Producers contracted McConaughey, {{who had recently}} finished filming Killer Joe (2011), well before True Detective was greenlit by HBO. Pizzolatto, impressed with the actor's performance in The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), originally assigned him the role of Martin Hart, but McConaughey offered [...] "a really compelling argument" [...] for portraying Rustin [...] "Rust" [...] Cohle. When asked about his decision to switch parts in a Variety interview, McConaughey replied: [...] "I wanted to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> dude’s head. The obsession, the island of a man—I’m {{always looking for a}} guy who monologues. It’s something really important as I feel I’m going into my better work." [...] To prepare, the actor studied his character through what he described the [...] "Four Stages of Rustin Cohle", a 450-page document he created detailing Rustin's evolution {{over the course of the}} story.|$|E
500|$|Davis toured relentlessly for {{two years}} while tolerating intense {{physical}} pain and difficulty walking, caused by joint pain from sickle-cell anaemia, badly damaged ankles after a 1972 car wreck, and osteoporosis in his left hip, which had been operated on a decade earlier. He had also developed nodules on his larynx that often left him short of breath, especially when playing the trumpet. To numb the pain, he became increasingly dependent on self-medicating with painkillers, cocaine, and morphine, which combined with his alcohol and recreational drug use led to mood swings; he would by turns feel vulnerable and hostile. By the end of 1974, a disappointing showing in Down Beat magazine's readers poll reinforced to Davis that his reputation had diminished. Unfazed by detractors and personal troubles, he kept his touring schedule intense. [...] "He was like the general looking at the fort {{and they had a}} moat {{and we were going to}} <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> fort", Henderson later said. [...] "That was the attitude of the band. We didn't give a shit what the critics said. People are gonna like what they like, but if you don't like it, respect it. Respect that I have the right to do what I do. Because with or without you, we're going to do it anyway." ...|$|E

500|$|Because {{the series}} is an anthology, each season has a {{self-contained}} narrative, following a disparate set of characters in various settings. Pizzolatto began contemplating the lead roles while he was pitching the series to networks in early 2012. True Detective anthology format only required actors to commit to a single season, so Pizzolatto was able to attract film stars who normally avoid television series because of their busy schedules. Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey were among the actors Pizzolatto considered for star billing. McConaughey, who had recently finished filming Killer Joe (2011), was contracted well before HBO commissioned the season. Impressed with his performance in The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), Pizzolatto at first assigned him to play Hart, but McConaughey convinced him {{to give him the}} part of Cohle. When asked in a Variety interview about his decision to switch parts, the actor replied, [...] "I wanted to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> dude's head. The obsession, the island of a man—I'm always looking for a guy who monologues. It's something really important as I feel I'm going into my better work." [...] To prepare for the role, McConaughey created a 450-page analysis—the [...] "Four Stages of Rustin Cohle"—to study his character's evolution during the season.|$|E
