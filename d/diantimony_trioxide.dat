40|$|Over {{the last}} decadeâ€™s flax fabrics are {{reverting}} as draperies, curtains and other interior materials. The necessity for reduced flammability of such textiles has been increased by governmental legislations {{in many countries}} [1]. It is noticeable, that hazards may occur by fires as the combined effects of smoke and toxic gases. Standards and codes of human safety based on recognized general requirements of fire protection are obligatory for lot of textile materials used in building, transport, construction, home and protection garments [2]. All fabrics will burn with some being more combustible than others. The burning rates can be reduced with flame retardants (FR), applied through treatment [3] with chemicals, such as inorganic salts, mix of ammonium polyphosphates, halogen donators, expandable graphite (intumescent) etc. [1]. The choice of every individual FR and kind of treatment depends on requirements for produced material. The antimony compounds can be safely used for the textile treatment without causing a risk to {{human health and the}} environment [4]. The aim of this research is investigation of burning characteristics of Latvian local linen /the raw linen and the bleached linen fabrics without and with continuous coating, containing commercial printing paste Printperfect EX-TS, pigment Bezaprint GELB (both producer CHT BEZEMA) and <b>diantimony</b> <b>trioxide</b> (Sb 2 O 3) as the flame-retardant additive...|$|E
