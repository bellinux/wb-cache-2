5|$|The {{player can}} {{navigate}} {{and interact with}} the game's environment, mainly carriages on the Orient Express, through use of a context-sensitive cursor. The cursor changes when it is placed over an item with which the player can interact, {{and can be used}} to talk to other characters, listen to other characters' conversations, look around the environment, and move. The player can walk to a location with a single click, and run to a location with a <b>double-click.</b> Double-clicking {{on the edge of the}} screen instantly takes the player to the next screen. There is a map of the train in the game's interface at the top of the screen, and once each carriage has been unlocked, the player can click on any part of the map and instantly be transported to that location, saving the player from having to travel through the train screen by screen. Another accessible feature is an objectives menu interface which states the general tasks the player should be attempting to complete. This menu is designed to guide players in the right direction without giving any explicit hints.|$|E
25|$|The {{handling}} of the autorun.inf file changes very significantly between each Windows version. The details {{can be found in}} the autorun.inf article. The current handling in Windows 7 is that only drives of type DRIVE_CDROM may specify an AutoRun task, alter <b>double-click</b> behaviour or change context menus.|$|E

Adam Harper of Dummy called it a [...] "pastiche [...] a kind of music you never knew you knew existed: techno-capitalist stock promotional music for the era of the personal computer ... Each track is bristling with the maximalist promise of a world of possibilities waiting behind the screen for your <b>double-click,</b> and evokes a time when we were much less familiar with and cynical about the virtual world technology has brought us into." ...|$|E
50|$|On most systems, <b>double-clicking</b> an icon in {{the file}} manager will perform a default action on the object {{represented}} by the icon. <b>Double-clicking</b> an application program will launch the program, and <b>double-clicking</b> a file icon will open the file in a default application for that file's type or format.|$|R

50|$|Prograph {{took these}} concept further, {{introducing}} {{a combination of}} object-oriented methodologies and a completely visual environment for programming. Objects are represented by hexagons with two sides, one containing the data fields, the other the methods that operate on them. <b>Double-clicking</b> on either side would open a window showing the details for that object; for instance, opening the variables side would show class variables {{at the top and}} instance variables below. <b>Double-clicking</b> the method side shows the methods implemented in this class, as well as those inherited from the superclass. When a method itself is <b>double-clicked,</b> it opens into another window displaying the logic.|$|R

5000|$|Generally, {{the effect}} of <b>double-clicking</b> a {{shortcut}} {{is intended to be}} the same as <b>double-clicking</b> the application or document to which it refers, but Windows shortcuts contain separate properties for the target file and the [...] "Start In" [...] directory.

50|$|The maximum delay {{required}} for two consecutive clicks {{to be interpreted}} as a <b>double-click</b> is not standardized. According to Microsoft's MSDN website, the default timing in Windows is 500 ms (half a second). The <b>double-click</b> time is also used as a basis for other timed actions.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>double-click</b> is {{the act of}} {{pressing}} a computer mouse button twice quickly without moving the mouse. Double-clicking allows two different actions {{to be associated with}} the same mouse button. It was developed by Bill Atkinson of Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) for their Lisa project. Often, single-clicking selects (or highlights) an object, while a <b>double-click</b> executes the function associated with that object. Following a link in a web browser is accomplished with only a single click, requiring the use of a second mouse button, [...] "click and hold" [...] delay, or modifier key to gain access to actions other than following the link. On touchscreens, the <b>double-click</b> is called [...] "double-tap"; it's not used as much as <b>double-click,</b> but typically it functions as a zoom feature. ("triple-tap" [...] sometimes used to zoom the whole screen.) ...|$|E
