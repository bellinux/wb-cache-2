50|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} blade designs for pruning shears: anvil, bypass and parrot-beak. Anvil pruners {{have only one}} blade, which closes onto a flat surface; unlike bypass blades it can be sharpened from both sides and remains reliable when slightly blunt. Anvil pruners are useful for cutting thick branches; one can bite into the stem from one direction, swing the handle around and bite further through narrowed wood from another direction. The anvil is made of a material softer than the blade, so that the blade is not damaged when it meets the anvil. Suitable materials for the anvil are plastic, aluminum, zinc, brass, or bronze alloys. The blades are made from hardened carbon or chromium steels. The hardness of the blades is generally between 54 and 58 HRC. On an anvil pruner, proper cutting is assured even if the blade swerves slightly {{to the left or}} right during cutting. As long as the blade meets the anvil {{at the end of the}} cut and fits tightly against it, the material is separated. For this reason, the blades of anvil pruners can be ground thinner than those on bypass pruners. The LÖWE principle - a drawing cut made against a fixed support - combines a drawing cut with a pushing cut. This is possible because the blade lever and base lever are connected by an <b>eccentric</b> <b>bearing.</b> When the pruners are open, the blade is longer than the anvil thanks to the <b>eccentric</b> <b>bearing.</b> When the pruners close, the blade draws back slightly while it pushes through the material. This reduces the cutting force needed to make a cut still further.|$|E

The journal bearing faults degrade machine performance, decrease life time service and unexpected failure which are dangerous for safety issues.

40|$|AbstractATP synthase is {{conceived}} as a rotatory engine with two reversible drives, the proton-transporting membrane portion, F 0, and the catalytic peripheral portion, F 1. They are mounted on a central shaft (subunit γ) and held together by an <b>eccentric</b> <b>bearing.</b> It is established that the hydrolysis of three molecules of ATP in F 1 drives the shaft over a full circle in three steps of 120 ° each. Proton flow through F 0 probably generates a 12 -stepped rotation of the shaft so that four proton-translocating steps of 30 ° each drive the synthesis of one molecule of ATP. We addressed the elasticity of the transmission between F 0 and F 1 in a model where the four smaller steps in F 0 load a torsional spring which is only released under liberation of ATP from F 1. The kinetic model of an elastic ATP synthase described a wealth of published data on the synthesis/hydrolysis of ATP by F 0 F 1 and on proton conduction by F 0 as function of the pH and the protonmotive force.

40|$|Laminar mixing in the {{two-dimensional}} time-periodic Stokes flows between <b>eccentric</b> cylinders [journal <b>bearing</b> flow (JBF) ] is studied {{using the}} extended mapping method [Galaktionov et al., Int. J. Multiphase Flows 28, 497 (2002) ] {{with the emphasis}} on the material stretching, e. g., the interface generation abilities, of the flow. With this flexible and computational advantageous method both, the macroscopic material transport and the evolution of the microstructure can be described. It enables a convenient way for studying the material stretching in the flow and moreover, it provides spatial distribution of locally averaged stretching values instead of pointwise statistics, which was typical for previous studies [Liu et al., AIChE J. 40, 1273 (1994); Muzzio et al., Phys. Fluids A 3, 822 (1991) ]. The results clearly indicate how the total amount of st! retching generated by the flow depends on the parameters of the flow protocol, and that this is not just proportional to the work done on the system, as was suggested earlier in Muzzio et al., Phys. Fluids A 3, 822 (1991). It was found that when self-similar patterns are established, distinctive zones in the flow, which we call 2 ̆ 2 microstructural demixing zones, 2 ̆ 2 are observed, where interfaces are contracted during a typical period of the mixing process.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. PART I: In this work, we establish {{the structure of}} the large [ [...] . ]-sized separatrix-swept regions in Hamiltonian systems which depend on a slow-varying parameter z: H = H(p,q,z = [ [...] . ]), where 0 < [ [...] . ] 1. These regions are complementary to those in which the theory of adiabatic invariance and Arnold's extension of the KAM Theorem to adiabatic systems apply. We prove the following theorem about the structure of lobes, which, being regions of phase space bounded by segments of intersecting stable and unstable manifolds terminating on principal homoclinic points, are the fundamental building blocks of homoclinic tangles. Theorem: The area of a lobe in (1. 1) is: A = [ [...] . ], where Z 0 and Z 1 are two adjacent simple zeroes of MA(z), the adiabatic Melnikov function of the system. We also derive a corollary: The area of a lobe in these systems is given to leading order by the difference between the areas enclosed by two sequential extremal instantaneous separatrices, [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ]. The remaining terms are [ [...] . ]. Theorem 1 and the corollary establish several important results: First, the area occupied by the homoclinic tangles formed by the intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds is [ [...] . ] to leading order. Second, Theorem 1 implies that the flux between regions separated by instantaneous separatrices is [ [...] . ] asymptotically, see Part II for an application. Third, for systems in which H depends periodically or quasiperiodically on z, Theorem 1 states that the region in which orbits evolve chaotically is [ [...] . ] in the limit of [ [...] . ]. This result stands in marked contrast to the known examples of chaotic systems in which the "stochastic" regions are either of [ [...] . ] or [ [...] . ] and vanish as [ [...] . ]. Finally, since islands must lie outside of the lobes, Theorem 1 shows that the phase space area in which islands must lie vanishes with [ [...] . ] as [ [...] . ]. We remark that we lower the upper bounds on island size presented in Elskens and Escande [1991] using asymptotic expansions of the exact resonance-zone area formula of MacKay and Meiss [1986]. We also derive an exact lobe area formula for general time-dependent Hamiltonian systems, which eliminates the need for the existence of a recurrent p - q section in the extended phase space assumed in the previous work. A direct measurement of the type used on weakly-perturbed Hamiltonian systems is not possible in adiabatic systems since the pieces of stable and unstable manifold defining the boundary of the lobe cannot be expressed as graphs over the unperturbed separatrix. Therefore, the shape-independence of this exact formula is needed. We illustrate our results on the adiabatic pendulum: H = [ [...] . ] cos q and on a model due to Hastings and McLeod. Finally, for z-periodic H, we show {{for the first time in}} an example that a Smale horseshoe map can be created in one iteration of the Poincare map. PART II: We study the transport of tracer dye in a low Reynolds number flow in the two-dimensional <b>eccentric</b> journal <b>bearing.</b> Modulation of the angular velocities of the cylinders continuously, slowly, and periodically in time causes the integrable steady-state flow to become nonintegrable. In stark contrast to the flows usually studied with dynamical systems, however, these slowly-varying systems are singular-perturbation problems in which the nonintegrability is due to the slow [ [...] . ] modulation of the position of the saddle stagnation point and the two streamlines stagnating on it. We establish an analytical technique to determine the location and size of the region in which mixing occurs. This technique gives us explicit control over the mixing process. We also develop a transport theory based on the lobes formed by the segments of stable and unstable manifolds of the fixed points of the Poincare map, which are responsible for the transport of tracer in the mixing zone. In particular, we show that the radically different shape of these lobes, as compared to the shape of the lobes studied in the usual flows, readily makes them identifiable as the mechanism by which the modulation causes the patches of tracer to develop into elaborately striated and folded lamellar structures. When the modulation frequency is small we apply the tools developed in Part I to analytically predict several important quantities associated with the lobes and transport theory for the first time. From the measurement of these quantities, we determine the combination of the flow parameters with which one achieves the most efficient mixing possible. Furthermore, we use an extension of the KAM theory to explain the highly-regular appearance of islands in quasi-steady Stokes' flows for the first time. Finally, we we show that diffusion enhances stretching, discuss the robustness of our model by analyzing the influence of the inertial terms, and compare our results to those obtained experimentally using so-called blinking protocols...|$|R
