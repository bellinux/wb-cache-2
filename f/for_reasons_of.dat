5|$|A 3-CD {{set of the}} Tertiary Phase was {{released}} in mid-October 2004, before the final episodes were broadcast. These CDs contain extended material, previously cut to make 27-minute episodes for radio. A 2-CD set of the Quandary Phase {{was released}} {{at the end of}} May 2005, and a 2-CD set of the Quintessential Phase was released at the end of June 2005. Both sets again include material that was originally cut <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> timing.|$|E
5|$|A multi-star system {{consists}} {{of two or more}} gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other. The simplest and most common multi-star system is a binary star, but systems of three or more stars are also found. <b>For</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> orbital stability, such multi-star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars. Larger groups called star clusters also exist. These range from loose stellar associations with only a few stars, up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars. Such systems orbit their host galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Auxiliary regiments {{were often}} {{stationed}} in provinces {{other than that}} {{in which they were}} originally raised, <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> security and to foster the process of Romanisation in the provinces.

In the 1970s, after trying and abandoning many others <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> sound or maintainability, he settled on the Japanese-made Pearl Drums.|$|E

5|$|Marilyn Waring {{described}} how {{the exclusion of}} non-market activities in the national accounting systems relied on the deliberate choice and {{the design of the}} international standard of national accounts that explicitly excluded non-market activities.

5|$|Officers in {{the field}} {{were well aware of}} the killing {{operations}} being conducted by the Einsatzgruppen. The Wehrmacht tried to justify their considerable involvement in the Einsatzgruppen massacres as being anti-partisan operations rather than racist attacks, but Hillgruber wrote that this was just an excuse. He states that those German generals who claimed that the Einsatzgruppen were a necessary anti-partisan response were lying, and maintained that the slaughter of about 2.2 million defenceless civilians <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> racist ideology cannot be justified.|$|E

Analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike, (1 November 1952, Enewetak Atoll), revealed high concentrations of various actinides, including berkelium. <b>For</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1990s, the BBC began to release {{existing}} audio of serials with missing episodes, with linking narration provided by former series actors such as Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, Colin Baker, Peter Purves, and Frazer Hines. By December 2005, the soundtracks {{for all of the}} missing episodes had been released, albeit with copyright-uncleared music replacements where necessary (e.g., a Beatles song in Evil of the Daleks), slightly rejigged sequences <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> clarity, and with overdubbed narration.|$|E
5|$|The {{temple and}} pyramid were also {{surrounded}} by a brick wall. Likely <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> economy, the causeway leading to the mortuary temple {{at the foot of}} the pyramid was never built, no satellite pyramid was added to the mortuary complex, and the valley temple was left unfinished. Consequently, the priest of the mortuary cult of Neferirkare lived on the temple premises, in dwellings of mud-bricks and rushes, rather than in the pyramid town closer to the Nile valley.|$|E

5000|$|The RSAA {{reviewed}} {{these claims}} and affirmed its long standing position {{that there are}} only four situations which equate to a failure of state protection: persecution committed by the state; persecution condoned by the state; persecution tolerated by the state and persecution not condoned and not tolerated by the state but nevertheless present because the state either refuses or is unable to offer adequate protection. [...] However, the RSAA also looked at how, in a civil war situation, a claimant can connect their anticipated harm with their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. [...] The RSAA said that a distinction must be made between equality of risk of harm with equality <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> that harm. The view of the RSAA was that a person at real risk <b>of</b> serious harm <b>for</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> his or her religion should not have to establish {{that he or she is}} more at risk <b>of</b> serious harm <b>for</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> religion than others who are equally at real risk <b>of</b> serious harm <b>for</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> their religion. In other words, the RSAA believed there was no requirement for a differerntial impact as suggested by Lord Lloyd above.|$|R

5|$|A {{small number}} of motte-and-bailey castles were built outside of {{northern}} Europe. In the late-12th century, the Normans invaded southern Italy and Sicily; although they had the technology to build more modern designs, in many cases wooden motte-and-bailey castles were built instead <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> speed. The Italians came {{to refer to a}} range of different castle types as motta, however, and there may not have been as many genuine motte-and-bailey castles in southern Italy as was once thought {{on the basis of the}} documentary evidence alone. In addition, there is evidence of the Norman crusaders building a motte and bailey using sand and wood in Egypt in 1221 during the Fifth Crusade.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by orthodontists {{who wish to}} delay or speed up the eruption of certain teeth <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches ⅓ of its total growth, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be delayed. Conversely, if {{the roots of the}} permanent tooth are more than ⅔ complete, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be accelerated. Between ⅓ and ⅔, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the model}} by sinologist Karl August Wittfogel, the loess soils of Shaanxi made it {{possible}} for the Chinese to develop irrigated agriculture early on. Although this allowed them to expand into the lower reaches of the Yellow River valley, such extensive waterworks on an ever-increasing scale required collective labour, something that could only be managed by some form of bureaucracy. Thus the scholar-bureaucrats came to the fore {{to keep track of the}} income and expenses of the granaries. Walled cities grew up around the granaries <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> defence along with ease of administration; they kept invaders out and ensured that citizens remained within. These cities combined to become feudal states, which eventually united to become an empire. Likewise, according to this model, walls not only enveloped cities as time went by, but also lined the borders of the feudal states and eventually the whole Chinese empire to provide protection against raids from the agrarian northern steppes.|$|E
