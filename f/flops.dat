5|$|In {{addition}} to reporting active processors, Folding@home determines its computing performance as measured in floating point {{operations per second}} (<b>FLOPS)</b> based on the actual execution time of its calculations. Originally this was reported as native FLOPS: the raw performance from each given type of processing hardware. In March 2009 Folding@home began reporting the performance in native and x86 <b>FLOPS,</b> the latter being an estimation of how many <b>FLOPS</b> the calculation would take on a standard x86 CPU architecture, which is commonly used as a performance reference. Specialized hardware such as GPUs can efficiently perform some complex functions in one floating point operation which otherwise needs multiple operations on the x86 architecture. The x86 measurement attempts to even out these hardware differences. Despite conservative conversions, the GPU clients' x86 <b>FLOPS</b> are consistently greater than their native <b>FLOPS</b> and comprise {{a large majority of}} Folding@home's measured computing performance.|$|E

Subthreshold operation is emerging as a good technique for low power design of circuits where speed of execution is not a primary concern.

The flip <b>flop</b> designed for this project is a master-slave D flip <b>flop.</b> The flip <b>flop</b> was designed in Design Architect, and the netlist was modified to 90 nm technology. The simulation was done using HSPICE. Results show that the flip <b>flop</b> operates perfectly in the subthreshold region of 90 nm technology while providing reasonable power and energy savings.

According to Ghosh, popular Bollywood actors were not {{willing to work with}} him after his two previous <b>flops.</b> He also believed that audience might expect more screen-time from a better-known actor.

5|$|In 2007, Guinness World Records {{recognized}} Folding@home as {{the most}} powerful distributed computing network. As of September 30, 2014, the project has 107,708 active CPU cores and 63,977 active GPUs for a total of 40.190 x86 petaFLOPS (19.282 native petaFLOPS). At the same time, the combined efforts of all distributed computing projects under BOINC totals 7.924 petaFLOPS. In November 2012, Folding@home updated its accounting of <b>FLOPS,</b> especially for GPUs, and now reports the number of active processor cores and physical processors. Using the Markov state model method, Folding@home achieves strong scaling across its user base and gains a linear speedup for every added processor. This network allows Folding@home to do work that was formerly impractical computationally.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{designer}} Peter James described Flight Unlimited IIIs {{development as}} a struggle, thanks {{to a lack of}} interest from Electronic Arts and from Looking Glass's management. Placed in direct competition with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 and Fly!, the game failed to capture sufficient market share. It became one of Looking Glass's biggest commercial <b>flops,</b> with roughly 20,000 units sold in the United States during 1999. This contributed to the company's closure in 2000. The game was well received by critics, who praised its terrain rendering and dynamic weather. Its simulated physics were lauded by several reviewers, but others felt that the physics were imprecise, and that the game's system requirements were extremely high.|$|E

5|$|The first {{generation}} of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU1) was {{released to the public}} on October2, 2006, delivering a 20-30X speedup for some calculations over its CPU-based GROMACS counterparts. It was the first time GPUs had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations. GPU1 gave researchers significant knowledge and experience with the development of GPGPU software, but in response to scientific inaccuracies with DirectX, on April10, 2008 it was succeeded by GPU2, the second generation of the client. Following the introduction of GPU2, GPU1 was officially retired on June6. Compared to GPU1, GPU2 was more scientifically reliable and productive, ran on ATI and CUDA-enabled Nvidia GPUs, and supported more advanced algorithms, larger proteins, and real-time visualization of the protein simulation. Following this, the third generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU3) was released on May25, 2010. While backward compatible with GPU2, GPU3 was more stable, efficient, and flexibile in its scientific abilities, and used OpenMM on top of an OpenCL framework. Although these GPU3 clients did not natively support the operating systems Linux and macOS, Linux users with Nvidia graphics cards were able to run them through the Wine software application. GPUs remain Folding@home's most powerful platform in <b>FLOPS.</b> As of November 2012, GPU clients account for 87% of the entire project's x86 <b>FLOPS</b> throughput.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPatterning of the {{vertebrate}} anterior–posterior axis {{is regulated}} by the coordinated action of growth factors whose effects can be further modulated by upstream and downstream mediators and the cross-talk of different intracellular pathways. In particular, the inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by various factors is critically required for anterior specification. Here, we report that <b>Flop</b> 1 and <b>Flop</b> 2 (<b>Flop</b> 1 / 2), G protein-coupled receptors related to Gpr 4, contribute to the regulation of head formation by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling in Xenopus embryos. Using whole-mount in situ hybridization, we showed that <b>flop</b> 1 and <b>flop</b> 2 mRNAs were expressed in the neural ectoderm during early gastrulation. Both the overexpression and knockdown of <b>Flop</b> 1 / 2 resulted in altered embryonic head phenotypes, while the overexpression of either <b>Flop</b> 1 / 2 or the small GTPase RhoA {{in the absence of}} bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling resulted in ectopic head induction. Examination of the Flops' function in Xenopus embryo animal cap cells showed that they inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling by promoting β-catenin degradation through both RhoA-dependent and -independent pathways in a cell-autonomous manner. These results suggest that <b>Flop</b> 1 and <b>Flop</b> 2 are essential regulators of Xenopus head formation that act as novel inhibitory components of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway...|$|R
