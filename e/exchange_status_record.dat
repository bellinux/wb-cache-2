40|$|The {{claim that}} {{marriage}} is a venue for <b>status</b> <b>exchange</b> of achieved traits, like education, and ascribed attributes, notably race and ethnic membership, has regained traction in the social stratifi cation literature. Most studies that consider <b>status</b> <b>exchanges</b> ignore birthplace as a social boundary for <b>status</b> <b>exchanges</b> via couple formation. This paper evaluates the <b>status</b> <b>exchange</b> hypothesis for Australia and the United States, two Anglophone nations with long immigration traditions whose admission regimes place diff erent emphases on skills. A log-linear analysis reveals evidence of <b>status</b> <b>exchange</b> in the United States among immigrants {{with lower levels of}} education and mixed nativity couples with foreign-born husbands. Partly because Australian educational boundaries are less sharply demarcated at the postsecondary level, we fi nd weaker evidence for the <b>status</b> <b>exchange</b> hypothesis. Australian <b>status</b> <b>exchanges</b> across nativity boundaries usually involve marriages between immigrant spouses with a postsecondary credential below a college degree and native-born high school graduates. Status exchange; immigration; educational assortative mating...|$|R

40|$|<b>Status</b> <b>exchange</b> {{theory has}} long held a central {{position}} {{in the study of}} interracial marriage between blacks and whites. Originally proposed by both Merton (1941) and Davis (1941) indepen-dently, <b>status</b> <b>exchange</b> theory predicts that interracial unions between blacks and whites will often involve an <b>exchange</b> of racial <b>status</b> for some other status characteristic, generally operationalized in research as education. Because whites may see marrying across racial lines as marrying “down-ward”, they must be compensated by marrying up on some other dimension. Therefore, <b>status</b> <b>exchange</b> theory predicts that whites in interracial marriages will be more upwardly mobile (hy-pergamous) and less downwardly mobile (hypogamous) in terms of education than if they were in a racially endogamous marriage. The opposite would be true for blacks in an interracial marriage. Although an early generation of scholars in the 1960 s and 1970 s found little evidence of <b>status</b> <b>exchange</b> using simple models, a more recent generation of scholars has found significant evidence of <b>status</b> <b>exchange,</b> using more sophisticated approaches that address the shortcomings of earlier research. Kalmijn (1993) found evidence of <b>status</b> <b>exchange</b> in marriage register data for 12 states from 1970 to 1986, using the hypergamy ratio approach. Qian (1997) replicated Kalmijn’s method on young couples in the 1980 and 1990 microdata samples of the US Census, and found simila...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the <b>recording</b> of smoking <b>status</b> and {{factors associated with}} the <b>recording</b> of smoking <b>status</b> in general practitioner (GP) electronic medical records (EMRs) in New Zealand, and the suitability of this source as a prevalence measure. Setting General practices affiliated with an Auckland-based primary health organisation. Population Patients registered with 84 / 107 (78. 5 %) eligible GPs who had used EMRs {{for at least a}} year and had PREDICT-CVD,a web-based cardiovascular disease risk assessment and management decision support program, integrated with their practice software. Design Audit of EMRs using data from an evaluation of PREDICT-CVD. Main outcome measures The proportion of EMRs audited (Maori, non-Maori) with smoking <b>status</b> <b>recorded</b> and, among those with smoking status recorded,al so Read-coded, and factors associated with greater <b>recording</b> of smoking <b>status.</b> Results Smoking <b>status</b> was <b>recorded</b> among 49. 6 % of Maori and 38. 3 % of non-Maori prior to the installation of PREDICT-CVD. Among those with smoking <b>status</b> <b>recorded,</b> smoking <b>status</b> was also Read-coded among 49. 8 % of Maori and 62. 3 % of non-Maori. Factors associated with greater <b>recording</b> of smoking <b>status</b> were installation of PREDICT-CVD, male sex, Maori ethnicity, cardio-vascular disease and diabetes. Age was also associated with the <b>recording</b> of smoking <b>status.</b> Conclusion General practitioner electronic medical records in New Zealand are currently not a suitable source of smoking prevalence data, even if manually searched, as a large proportion of records did not have smoking <b>status</b> <b>recorded.</b> Such records are an even less suitable source of smoking prevalence if data extraction by remote querying (using Read codes) is relied upon. The potential to estimate the prevalence of smoking from GP records has not yet become a reality. Installation of electronic decision support systems, such as PREDICT-CVD, could improve the recording and Read-coding of smoking status, and thereby the availability and accessibility of these data...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{document}} {{the frequency of}} recording of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status in general practice (GP) clinical records and to establish associations of this recording. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of recording of patients' Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status in GP clinical records from GP training practices in four Australian states. Results: Of the 9, 704 clinical records examined, the patients' Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status had been documented in 5, 165 (53. 2 %). Higher rates of recording were associated with older patient age, practices outside a major city, patients who were not new to the practice and the patient being Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander. In encounters with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients, the patient's status had been documented in 82 % of records. Those attending larger practices {{were less likely to}} have had their <b>status</b> <b>recorded.</b> Conclusions: This is the first report of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander <b>status</b> <b>recording</b> in GP clinical records. Almost 20 % of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients did not have their <b>status</b> <b>recorded</b> in the clinical record, with indications that recording may be unsystematic. Implications: Our findings reinforce the need for a systematic approach to identification of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status in general practice and will inform policy and practice in this important area...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the feasibility of improving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander <b>status</b> <b>recording</b> for notifiable diseases using all Invasive Pneumococcal Disease (IPD) notifications in a regional area of New South Wales, Australia. In Australia people with IPD are nearly always admitted to hospital and their Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander <b>status</b> is <b>recorded.</b> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status was determined for IPD notifications by referring to the routine hospital admission data in a regional area of New South Wales, Australia. There were 234 notifications in the regional area of Hunter New England during the period 2007 – 2009. Initially, 168 (72 %) notifications had Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander <b>status</b> <b>recorded.</b> After referring to the routine hospital admission data, the <b>recorded</b> <b>status</b> increased to 232 (99 %). Updating the surveillance data required less than five minutes per notification. Referring to routine hospital admission data proved a useful and time-efficient surveillance strategy to increase the proportion of notifications with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status. These data can then be used to better understand the current epidemiology of IPD. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged 0 – 4 years have a two- to threefold higher rate of invasive pneumococcal disease than non-Aboriginal children, thus high levels of timely pneumococcal immunization coverage remain important for young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children...|$|R
