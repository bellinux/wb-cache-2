50|$|In the European Union, {{passenger}} vehicles are commonly tested using two drive cycles, and corresponding <b>fuel</b> <b>economies</b> are reported as 'urban' and 'extra-urban', in litres per 100 km and (in the UK) in miles per imperial gallon.|$|R
50|$|As of MY2016, export-spec {{models are}} {{available}} in EcoBoost and GT specifications only, also in slightly different engine tunes. The EcoBoost outputs at 317ps@5,700rpm and 432Nm@3,000rpm while the GT outputs at a slightly de-tuned 416ps@6,500rpm and 530Nm@4,250rpm. Per Ford's claims, combined <b>fuel</b> <b>economies</b> of the Fastback under the Euro 6 emissions standard are 10.2km/L and 7.8km/L respectively.|$|R
5|$|The 2012 {{model year}} American-spec i-MiEV ranked first in United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) 2012 Annual <b>Fuel</b> <b>Economy</b> Guide, and between November 2011 and June 2012 ranked {{as the most}} {{efficient}} EPA certified vehicle in the U.S. for all fuels ever, until it was surpassed by the Honda Fit EV.|$|E
5|$|Featuring {{only four}} engines, the design also {{required}} new engine designs with greatly increased power and better <b>fuel</b> <b>economy.</b> In May 1964, airframe proposals arrived from Boeing, Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed, and Martin Marietta; engine proposals were submitted by General Electric, Curtiss-Wright, and Pratt & Whitney. After a downselect, Boeing, Douglas, and Lockheed were given additional study contracts for the airframe, along with General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for the engines.|$|E
5|$|In summary, {{the main}} {{competencies}} of the Tagora were its spacious cabin (though {{it was not}} class-leading), its comfortable seating, its <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> (in 2.2 GLS form) {{and the size of}} its luggage compartment (572 litres). But the fact that a car launched in 1974, the Volvo 244 GLE, could offer better seats, disc brakes all round, better headlights, better ventilation and better handling for only slightly more than Talbot was charging for their car indicated that the Tagora had come to market with a vehicle that was uncompetitive in too many major respects.|$|E
50|$|The lithium economy {{differs from}} the other {{proposed}} future <b>fuel</b> <b>economies</b> in that the transition roadmap begins with conventional rechargeable batteries using conventional Li-ion or Lithium polymer cell batteries and progressing to chemistries (such as Li-S and Li-iron-phosphate) and cell types with higher energy densities. Eventually, anode replacement Li-air or Li-water cells are envisaged where only anodes (lithium metal) are replaced.|$|R
30|$|Since {{there are}} 121.7 and 135.8  MJ (lower heating value) in {{a gallon of}} {{gasoline}} and diesel fuels, respectively, these current <b>fuel</b> <b>economies</b> correspond to a total fuel energy use of 1.85 and 1.52  MJ/km for gasoline and diesel engines, respectively. Therefore, current diesel vehicles consume 21.5 % less energy than comparable gasoline vehicles. Life cycle impacts related to the vehicle production, servicing, and end-of-life {{were not included in}} this LCA.|$|R
5000|$|The Baldwin 60000 {{prototype}} {{worked at}} a modest [...] and did not use either of the complex systems described above. It had a relatively conventional watertube firebox and a firetube boiler. Nevertheless, high maintenance costs and poor reliability more than cancelled the <b>fuel</b> <b>economies</b> promised by high-pressure and compounding, and the design was not repeated. Other relatively conventional high-pressure locomotives {{were built in the}} USA, including the remarkable triple-expansion L F Loree locomotive of 1933. None was successful.|$|R
5|$|The E85 blend {{is used in}} {{gasoline}} engines modified to accept such higher concentrations of ethanol, and the fuel injection is regulated through a dedicated sensor, which automatically detects the amount of ethanol in the fuel, allowing to adjust both fuel injection and spark timing accordingly to the actual blend available in the vehicle's tank. Because ethanol contains close to 34% less energy per unit volume than gasoline, E85 FFVs have a lower mileage per gallon than gasoline. Based on EPA tests for all 2006 E85 models, the average <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> for E85 vehicles was 25.56% lower than unleaded gasoline.|$|E
5|$|Duration: For most goods, {{the longer}} a price change holds, {{the higher the}} {{elasticity}} is likely to be, {{as more and more}} consumers find they have the time and inclination to search for substitutes. When fuel prices increase suddenly, for instance, consumers may still fill up their empty tanks in the short run, but when prices remain high over several years, more consumers will reduce their demand for fuel by switching to carpooling or public transportation, investing in vehicles with greater <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> or taking other measures. This does not hold for consumer durables such as the cars themselves, however; eventually, it may become necessary for consumers to replace their present cars, so one would expect demand to be less elastic.|$|E
5|$|In March 2001, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey {{implemented}} a discount on regular toll fees during off-peak hours for those vehicles paying electronically with an EZ Pass issued in New York State. These discount toll was {{implemented a}}t several tunnels and bridges connecting New York City and New Jersey, including the George Washington Bridge, Lincoln Tunnel, and Holland Tunnel, {{and at some}} other bridges administrated by PANYNJ. Since March 2008, qualified low-emission automobiles with a <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> of at least 45 miles per gallon are eligible to receive a Port Authority Green Pass, which allows for a 50% discount during off-peak hours {{as compared to the}} regular full toll.|$|E
50|$|In the 2008 {{legislative}} session, Levy introduced {{bills to}} prioritize transportation funds for communities that engage in smart growth planning, to impose new fees on vehicles with low <b>fuel</b> <b>economies</b> {{to fund the}} state's Office of Smart Growth, and a bill to extend state tax credits for historic preservation. A bill to require electric utilities to devote 2 percent of sales revenue to energy efficiency programs passed the house over objections that it would prove costly to municipal electric authorities.|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} gasoline prices on short-run equilibrium prices and sales of new and used cars of different <b>fuel</b> <b>economies.</b> We find that gasoline prices have larger effects on the prices of used cars than of new cars, but that they have large effects on market shares and sales of new cars.

50|$|The Aspen was {{the first}} truck-based SUV commercialized under the Chrysler brand, {{although}} the PT Cruiser {{was the first}} truck-based Chrysler brand vehicle as classified under Corporate Average <b>Fuel</b> <b>Economy's</b> (CAFE) regulation. With this introduction, as of 2007, all American automobile brands had an SUV in their range. The truck was unveiled at the 2005 North American International Auto Show. The Aspen came equipped with three rows of seating for eight passengers and available all-wheel drive. It was available in only one trim, Limited.|$|R
5|$|The {{flexibility}} of Brazilian FFVs empowers the consumers {{to choose the}} fuel depending on current market prices. As ethanol <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline, flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of ethanol fuel. As a rule of thumb, Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fuel}} price {{increases}} of the 2000s, the EPA and many companies {{have sought to}} increase diesel truck <b>fuel</b> <b>economy.</b> One such example is the hydraulic hybrid vehicle, which stores energy in hydraulic tanks and hydraulic motors (as opposed to the electric hybrid vehicle which uses batteries and regenerative brakes). Electric hybrid vehicles are another option, with savings of 35 to 60 percent over traditional vehicles. Drivers themselves may improve fuel efficiency by using a method called progressive shifting, in which the driver shifts through the gears (typical trucks may have between 10 and 18 gears) {{in such a manner}} as to optimize the power range of the engine.|$|E
5|$|Ireland is {{the third}} best seller European market of E85 flex-fuel vehicles, after Sweden and France. Bioethanol (E85) in Ireland is made from whey, a waste product of cheese manufacturing. The Irish {{government}} established several incentives, including a 50% discount in vehicle registration taxes (VRT), which can {{account for more than}} one third of the retail price of a new car in Ireland (around €6,500). The bioethanol element of the E85 fuel is excise-free for fuel companies, allowing retail prices to be low enough to offset the 25 per cent cut in <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> that E-85 cars offer, due to ethanol's lower energy content than gasoline. Also, the value added tax (VAT) on the fuel can also be claimed back. E-85 fuel is available across the country in more than 20 of Maxol service stations. In October 2005, the 1.8 Ford Focus FFV became the first flexible-fuel vehicle to be commercially sold in Ireland. Later Ford launched the C-max and the Mondeo flexifuel models. Saab and Volvo also have E85 models available.|$|E
40|$|Emissions {{pollution}} studies, noise studies, {{and engine}} performance studies and {{their place in}} QCGAT developmental program status are reported. The Lycoming TFE 731 turbofan engine, the GE T 700 -GE- 700 high bypass ratio turbofan, and the AVCO-Lycoming LTS 101 turboshaft engine are prominent candidates in the tests for urban quiet turbofan service. Two phases in the program are characterized. Engine quieting, polluting emissions abatement, and <b>fuel</b> <b>economies</b> are particularly important for the anticipated rise in number of jet propulsion craft using smaller airports adjacent to communities accustomed to low noise/pollution backgrounds...|$|R
50|$|The claimed {{advantage}} for this arrangement, {{as with other}} compounding arrangements, was greater economy due to lower fuel and water consumption. In practice uneven forces at the crosshead produced excess wear, with increased maintenance costs thus offsetting any <b>fuel</b> <b>economies.</b> The integration of the compounding system into the smokebox saddle made conversion to conventional engines straightforward, so most Vauclain compounds were so converted and led normal lives thereafter. The only known operable example is Manitou and Pikes Peak Railway #4, which is preserved on-site along with the static display of its sister #5.|$|R
50|$|The OCP {{technology}} was sold as intellectual property (IP) to automobile, marine and motorcycle manufacturers and was incorporated in production engines to varying degrees; namely from complete systems to {{the improvement of}} their own technology, via knowledge gained from their IP purchases. All licensing payments were conditional upon the delivery of engines meeting numerous high emissions standards, <b>fuel</b> <b>economies</b> and other technical criteria. All deliveries met these criteria prior to Sarich's retirement in 1992, resulting in no dependent monetary penalties ever being incurred to that point in time.|$|R
5|$|Recent Corporate Average <b>Fuel</b> <b>Economy</b> (CAFE) {{regulations}} have {{given rise to}} a new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase steel, which is heat treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure to produce a formable, high strength steel. Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy ferritic steels. By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat. Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel uses a specific type of strain to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy.|$|E
5|$|The B-52H had {{the same}} crew and {{structural}} changes as the B-52G. The most significant upgrade was the switch to TF33-P-3 turbofan engines which, despite the initial reliability problems (corrected by 1964 under the Hot Fan program), offered considerably better performance and <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> than the J57 turbojets. The ECM and avionics were updated, a new fire control system was fitted, and the rear defensive armament was changed from machine guns to a 20mm M61 Vulcan cannon (later removed in 1991–94). The final 18 aircraft were manufactured with provision for the ADR-8 countermeasures rocket, which was later retrofitted to {{the remainder of the}} B-52G and B-52H fleet. A provision was made for four GAM-87 Skybolt ballistic missiles. The aircraft's first flight occurred on 10 July 1960, and it entered service on 9 May 1961. This is the only variant still in use by the USAF. A total of 102 B-52Hs were built. The last production aircraft, B-52H AF Serial No. 61-0040, left the factory on 26 October 1962.|$|E
5|$|The LS 400 {{was praised}} for its quietness, {{well-appointed}} and ergonomic interior, engine performance, build quality, aerodynamics, <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> and value. However, it was criticized by some automobile columnists for derivative styling and a suspension regarded as too compromising of handling for ride comfort. In some markets it was priced against mid-size, six-cylinder Mercedes-Benz and BMW models. It was rated by Car and Driver magazine as {{better than the}} higher-priced Mercedes-Benz 420 SEL and BMW 735i in terms of ride, handling and performance. The LS 400 also won motoring awards from automotive publications including Automobile Magazine and Wheels Magazine. Lexus quickly established customer loyalty and its debut was generally regarded {{as a shock to}} existing luxury marques. BMW's and Mercedes-Benz's U.S. sales figures dropped 29 percent and 19 percent, respectively, with BMW executives accusing Lexus of dumping in that market, while 35 percent of Lexus buyers traded in a Lincoln or Cadillac.|$|E

5|$|Electric cars, {{as well as}} plug-in hybrids {{operating}} in all-electric mode, emit no harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of power, such as particulates (soot), volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and various oxides of nitrogen. The clean air benefit is usually local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants. In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles {{operating in}} all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but {{from the point of view}} of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. This fact has been referred to as the long tailpipe of plug-in electric vehicles. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles and higher than hybrid electric vehicles. In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine, tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher <b>fuel</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, <b>fuel</b> <b>economy,</b> stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E
25|$|The average motor vehicle, {{including}} light trucks, in the US had a <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> {{rating of}} 17.1 MPG or 13.8 liters per 100 kilometers. The average <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> for passenger {{vehicles in the}} United States has remained stagnant throughout the 1990s and 2000s, peaking in 2001 and 2004. The 90s saw the slowest increase in <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> since 1960, with <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> increasing from 16.4 MPG in 1990 to 16.9 MPG in 2001. This {{is in contrast to}} the 1980s when the average <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> improved somewhat more significantly from 13.3 MPG in 1980 to 16.4 MPG in 1990. The increase in <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> during the 1990s is largely due to the rising popularity of Sport utility vehicles (SUV), whose status as light trucks gains them exception from the <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> restrictions placed on sedans and other cars.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} widely discussed (and often debated) {{policies and}} design strategies {{used to reduce}} greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through changes in land use, the built environment and transportation system management, vis-à-vis travel choices. Anticipation of design and policy impacts should prove helpful as cities grow. For example, densification facilitates carbonsaving reductions in trip lengths along with beneficial mode and vehicle ownership shifts, while moderating numerous other problems associated with sprawl. However, lower speeds result in much lower <b>fuel</b> <b>economies,</b> per mile traveled, while delaying travel. Policies like roadspace and vehicle rationing or taxes and tolls with credits and feebates can greatly mitiage the potential congestion, emissions, and travel delay issues...|$|R

Notwithstanding its superior fuel efficiency was widely popularized, the high pressure expansive engine did not find widespread application in other steam-using regions (in particular in Lancashire), where the favourite option remained the Watt low pressure engine. In this paper, we provide a reassessment of the factors accounting for the precocious adoption of the high pressure steam engine in Cornwall and for its delayed fortune in the rest of Britain...|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the Big Three could enjoy profit margins of $10,000 per SUV, while losing {{a few hundred}} dollars on a compact car. Consequently, these {{companies}} focused resources and design on SUVs over small cars (compact cars were sold mainly to attract young buyers with inexpensive options and to increase their fleet average <b>fuel</b> <b>economies</b> to meet federal standards). As a result of the shift in the Big Three's strategy, many long-running compact and midsize cars like the Ford Taurus, Buick Century, and Pontiac Grand Prix eventually fell behind their Japanese competition in features and image (relying more upon fleet sales instead of retail and/or heavy incentive discounts), some eventually being discontinued.|$|R
