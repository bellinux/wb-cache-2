25|$|During {{the early}} stages of World War II, Crainic gave Baciu the office of <b>editorial</b> <b>secretary</b> at Gândirea magazine, but sacked him upon finding out about his Social Democratic loyalties. According to {{communist}} sources, Baciu was himself an affiliate or sympathizer of the Iron Guard—a claim that has since been disputed; Baciu's PSDR membership and his mother's Jewishness disqualified him for such an enterprise. By his own account, Baciu was a malagambist, meaning that he followed the zoot-clad jazzman Sergiu Malagamba and had cosmopolitan, Americophile tastes. He did however befried the Guard's poet laureate, Radu Gyr, helping him publish in Gândirea even after the Guard's violent fall from grace in early 1941.|$|E

2500|$|George Ivașcu (most common {{rendition}} of Gheorghe I. Ivașcu; July 22, 1911 [...] June 21, 1988) was a Romanian journalist, literary critic, and communist militant. From beginnings as a University of Iași philologist and librarian, {{he was drawn}} into left-wing antifascist politics, while earning accolades as a newspaper editor and foreign-affairs journalist. Openly confronting the Iron Guard and fascism in general, he was persecuted and went into hiding {{during the first two}} years of World War II. He reemerged as a pseudonymous correspondent, then <b>editorial</b> <b>secretary,</b> of the magazine Vremea, slowly turning it away from fascism. In parallel, he also contributed to the clandestine left-wing press, preparing for an Allied victory.|$|E
2500|$|On July 1, 1893, Diamandy {{published}} {{the first issue}} of a [...] "monthly for scientific socialism", L'Ère Nouvelle ("The New Era"). It viewed itself as both a literary and a sociological review: dedicated to promoting literary naturalism and historical materialism, openly provoking the reading public to explore the work of Zola, it attacked the [...] "reactionary" [...] critics. It also proudly called itself [...] "eclectic". L'Ère Nouvelle hosted articles by Marxist thinkers from the various countries of Europe: primarily Friedrich Engels and Paul Lafargue, but also Georgi Plekhanov, Clara Zetkin, Karl Kautsky, Jean Jaurès, Gabriel Deville, and Jules Guesde. Its regular contributors included Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, the Romanian Marxist doyen, Duc-Quercy, the French strike organizer, with the additional presence of Racoviță, Zévaès, Victor Jaclard, Alexandre Millerand, Adolphe Tabarant, Ilya Rubanovich, and Ioan Nădejde; Leó Frankel was the <b>editorial</b> <b>secretary.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In time, Curentul Nou {{identified}} {{itself with}} {{a new form of}} traditionalist, peasant-oriented, literature, as advocated by the formerly socialist [...] "Poporanists". As noted by literary theorist Eugen Lovinescu, the Galaţi paper was a direct predecessor of the leading Poporanist monthly Viaţa Românească, founded at Iaşi in 1906. Ibrăileanu approached both Sanielevici and Dobrogeanu-Gherea with offers to head the editorial staff, but both, in turn, refused his invitation. At the time, the other Poporanists were beginning to protest against the Curentul Nou branch: publicist Spiridon Popescu, who was Ibrăileanu's companion, threatened to quit if the [...] "insane" [...] Sanielevici and [...] "the Jewish critic" [...] Gherea were ever on board. Sanielevici only began contributing there in 1908, and, in 1909, was made the <b>editorial</b> <b>secretary.</b> He was still mainly active in Galaţi, where, in early 1909, he joined a fundraising drive to complete a statue of Eminescu.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the war on}} the Eastern Front dragged on, Vremea grew a{{political}}. Its hosting {{of political}} undesirables intensified: the magazine inaugurated a [...] "cohabitation" [...] of the political opposites. At some point between late 1941 and summer 1942 (the circumstances are disputed), Ivașcu was appointed <b>editorial</b> <b>secretary,</b> and began signing in his own name the cultural column, critical essays, and reportage pieces from Slovakia (where he most likely traveled in mid 1942). He also kept up his foreign-affairs contributions, but used his old pseudonyms and the pen name Analist. In 1943, the Battle of Stalingrad, which Ivașcu refused to report on, {{put an end to}} the German-and-Romanian advances. Consequently, Ivașcu persuaded his boss, Vladimir Donescu, to renounce fascism for good. Vremea offered its columns to known leftists such as Călinescu, Virgil Ierunca, Ion Pas, and Radu Boureanu. Ivașcu also had contacts with the liberal Doinaș and other Sibiu Literary Circle members, whose ideas he chronicled for Vremea.|$|E
2500|$|The {{subsequent}} period {{marked the}} start of Ivașcu's close friendship with the senior literary critic George Călinescu, whose activities were carefully recorded by Iașul. Ivașcu was especially enthusiastic about Călinescu's plan to transform Iași into a Romanian cultural capital: this, he noted, was [...] "the very reason why our paper exists." [...] Upon Ivănescu's return to Iași, Ivașcu lost his university position, and taught Romanian Literature {{at a high school}} in Iași. In January 1939, he became <b>editorial</b> <b>secretary</b> at Călinescu's Jurnalul Literar. Ivașcu greatly admired Călinescu's antifascism and rationalism; however, the Siguranța reported of his debates with Călinescu, with the latter refusing to allow more communists at Jurnalul Literar. According to such sources, Călinescu feared that a left-turn would expose the magazine to attacks from the far-right. Still, Călinescu paid homage to Ivașcu as an [...] "excellent" [...] journalist and man of letters, with [...] "a great devotion to a certain idea." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{main focus}} of Sanielevici's early work as a critic was {{defending}} Dobrogeanu-Gherea's Marxist literary theory against Junimea, the conservative literary society. Late in the 20th century, cultural historian Z. Ornea described how Sanielevici, Garabet Ibrăileanu, Traian Demetrescu, Anton Bacalbaşa, Emil Fagure and other [...] "young socialists" [...] took up the combat when Gherea remained silent, and responded with an [...] "offensive" [...] to the Junimist jibes. The leading Junimist theorist and cultural critic, Titu Maiorescu, issued formal retorts, responding to specific points made by Sanielevici. Nevertheless, the [...] "young socialist" [...] militant also published articles in the Junimea magazine, Convorbiri Literare. Additionally, he was a leading contributor to, {{and for a while}} <b>editorial</b> <b>secretary</b> of, the eclectic journal Noua Revistă Română, run by the ex-Junimist philosopher Constantin Rădulescu-Motru. It was there that he began a series of articles in defense of didacticism, with which he established his reputation as a cultural journalist. Noua Revistă Română was also the place where, some years later, Sanielevici met and befriended fellow journalist Constantin Beldie.|$|E

Recent reports by Chinese media indicate a gradual release from party control. For example, the detention of anti-government petitioners placed in mental institutions was reported in a state newspaper, later criticised in an editorial by the English-language China Daily. Scholars and journalists believe that such reports are a small sign of opening up in the media.|$|R
