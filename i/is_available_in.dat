5|$|Backcountry hiking <b>is</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> the Craters of the Moon Wilderness and {{the much}} larger Backcountry Area beyond (added in 2000). Only two trails enter the {{wilderness}} area and even those stop after a few miles or kilometers. From there most hikers follow the Great Rift and explore its series of seldom-visited volcanic features. All overnight backcountry hikes require registration with a ranger. No drinking water <b>is</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> the backcountry and the dry climate quickly dehydrates hikers. Avoiding summer heat and winter cold are therefore recommended by rangers. Pets, camp fires, and all mechanized vehicles, including bicycles, are not allowed in the wilderness area.|$|E
