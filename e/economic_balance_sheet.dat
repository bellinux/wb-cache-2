40|$|The {{dissertation}} thesis {{deals with}} valuation of individual {{items in the}} <b>economic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of a stand-alone company and subsequently {{as a part of}} acquisition. We define the <b>economic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> as a full set of assets, liabilities as well as synergies amongst the assets (stand-alone company view) and companies (transaction view), where the sum of their individual valuations has to equal to the overall value of the company. Hence we suggest that the management (and a valuer) should be able to decompose the company value into defined and controllable value components. Apart from identifying optimal methods for the individual valuation, the key for achieving this task is the internal (amongst the assets) as well as the overall consistency (vis-a-vis the overall company value). Compared to the overall-valuation approach, we demonstrate how the component approach can lead to more precise results, higher management discipline and accountability, and can serve as a tool for an a priori identification of overpayment as well as an instrument for controlling the value post transaction. We defined two primary types of synergies in terms of valuation approach - Enhancement, improving current income potential and Future opportunities, mainly focusing on new projects - and proposed appropriate valuation approaches given their specifics. Since a large proportion of valuations on individual level is based on the income approach, setting a clear and consistent approach to discount rates was {{a vital part of the}} work. We propose a primary and, if not available, second-best rate for each component of the <b>economic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet.</b> Although the synergies are probably of the highest commercial interest, the liabilities with external source of risk and deferred taxes on the individual level are areas generally neglected both by academics and practitioners. While the first one will have only but crucial impact on companies with decommissioning and similar liabilities, the latter is present almost in any itemized valuation, and its incorrect or purely isolated application affects the overall result and breaks the link to the overall company value. We analyze both topics and offer consistent valuation methods, although further research is required to refine them. We discuss WARA as one of the key tools for ensuring consistency of itemized valuation of the <b>economic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet.</b> Lacking any theoretical background and interest from academic researchers, we first analyze simple concepts of the tool as they are used in practice and point out observed conceptual errors, oversimplifications and accounting-only approach. Not only that we propose complex consistent rules for WARA construction but we extend the concept from the focus on conventionally defined net assets to the full <b>economic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet,</b> which is the only way how to relate the itemized valuation to the overall company valuation. Finally, we presented a case study based on real-life example which demonstrated practical applicability of proposed partial solutions as well as the overall approach to achieving consistency with the total company or transaction valuation. Although the analysis of individual items of the economic balance will be inevitably based on subjective assumptions to an extent, we have shown that proposed complex and consistent approach adds value to the strategic and transaction considerations. Also the preciseness of the tools will increase with the number of transactions performed as the parameters get calibrated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Banking crises involve {{periods of}} {{persistently}} low credit and <b>economic</b> growth. Banks’ <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> are then weak {{but so are}} those of non-financial corporate borrowers. Hence, a crucial question is whether credit growth is low due to supply or to demand factors. However convincing identification has been elusive {{due to a lack}} of detailed loan application-, bank-, and firm-level data. Access to a dataset of loan applications in Spain that is matched with complete bank and firm balance-sheet data covering the period from 2002 to 2010 allows us to identify bank and firm balancesheet channels. We find robust evidence showing that bank balance-sheet strength determines the success of loan applications and the granting of loans in crisis times. The heterogeneity in firm balance-sheet strength determines loan granting in both good and crisis times, although the potency of this firm balance-sheet channel is the largest in the latter period. Our findings therefore hold important implications for both theory and policy. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{key issues}} and reflects the current debates around two important regulatory projects: Solvency II and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Phase II. The Solvency II project {{is based on}} an <b>economic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> and proposes an economic valuation of insurance liabilities that is very close to the European industry position on assessment of risks and solvency requirements based on how the business is managed. One key element is still under debate: diversification across portfolios. The industry considers that the entity's own diversification must be reflected in the valuation of the insurance liabilities while the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors’ has referred to an empty undertaking. IFRS Phase II can appear to be an approach similar to Solvency II, but actually is based on fundamental flaws, excluding future cash flows, and insurers actions, referring to a theoretical market participant efficiency instead of the entity's specific data for expenses, unbundling artificially insurance and financial components, taking into account insurer's own credit standing and adding a service margin to the risk margin. The diverging timetables of IFRS and Solvency II lead to a risk that IFRS and solvency could be non-aligned and increase the danger that IFRS for insurance may be distant from the economics of the business. A consensus within the industry is therefore crucial to facilitate the progress of the international standard for insurance accounting, which would give a true and fair presentation of the economics of the business.

40|$|The IASB {{has issued}} a Discussion Paper on {{accounting}} for insurance and reinsurance contracts. This project {{is based on a}} prospective measurement of the insurance liabilities, the current exit value, which corresponds to a “market consistent” transfer value of insurance contracts to another market participant. This project is similar to the Elaborated Principles (the EPs) proposed by the CFO Forum in June 2006 : a single model for measuring the insurance liabilities based on a three building blocks approach: expected future cash flows, discounted at risk-free rate, plus a margin for risk and uncertainties. However, there are key major differences between the two. Those differences concern several areas: future cash flows (only cash flows which are legally or contractually enforceable would be recognized), “market consistent” approach (in particular estimation of expenses should be based on a theoretical level of efficiency rather than on the own costs of the insurer), service margin (according to the IASB, to be transferred to another market participant), and upfront profit recognition of initial margins (rather than over time as for other long-term services). The European insurers disagree with the IASB view that such service margin concept is relevant. They also disagree that the retail market and the wholesale market for insurance would be the same. They think there is a significant difference between entry and exit prices, that is, a significant initial profit. The insurers are concerned by the consequences of those proposals, which would lead to a non-economic valuation of the insurance liabilities and a flawed pattern of profit recognition. Since the measurement of assets and liabilities in Solvency II project should be based on IFRS, the IASB accounting for insurance project could jeopardize Solvency II, which is currently based on an <b>economic</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> approach. The CFO Forum has been supporting a market consistent measurement of liabilities for accounting purposes that is the same as proposed under Solvency II. The CFO Forum is considering alternatives for recognition of profit over the time of contracts when the risk is released and the services rendered to policyholders; these alternatives should be consistent with recognition of the initial profit margin as available capital for solvency requirements.

These hypotheses are to be applied within an interdisciplinary theoretical structure of financial accounting. The focus of financial accounting research is applied to a philosophical framework of accountability and standardisation of measurement.
