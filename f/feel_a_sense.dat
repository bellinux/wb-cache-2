5|$|His public enemies, {{even the}} men who {{directed}} the fatal shot, ne'er spoke or wrote of him without expressions of marked respect; those whom he commanded loved him even to idolatry; and I, his associate and commander, fail in words adequate to express my opinion of his great worth. I feel assured that every patriot in America, on hearing this sad news, will <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of personal loss, and the country generally will realize that we have lost, not only an able military leader, but a man who, had he survived, was qualified to heal the national strife which has been raised by designing and ambitious men.|$|E
5|$|Prevalent minorities, {{particularly}} Hindu and Christian, <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{of vulnerability}} {{because of their}} religious beliefs. Labourers and farmhands comprise the countless Christian villages throughout Punjab; many are descendants of people who converted from Hinduism to Christianity under the British Raj, and considered low caste {{by virtue of their}} birth. A small population of wealthy, well-educated Christians have settled in Karachi; however, as a result of increasing Islamization, religious intolerance in Pakistani society, blashphemy laws and Islamist militancy, most have left Pakistan to settle in other countries where there is more religious tolerance, such as Canada and Australia.|$|E

25|$|Meaning-making through {{spirituality and}} religiosity is {{significant}} because it helps individuals cope with their loss, as well as develop their own spiritual or religious beliefs.

25|$|Greenberg (1987) {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} organizational justice with regard to how an employee judges the behaviour of the organization and the employee's resulting attitude and behaviour.

Parents are quite often subject to levels of childhood aggression, typically {{in the form of}} verbal or physical abuse, in excess of normal childhood aggressive outbursts. Parents <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of shame and humiliation to have that problem, so they rarely seek help; nor is much help available today.|$|E

Those who have experienced a loss of trust will often also experience some form of grief.|$|E
25|$|The Native American {{language}} education {{movement has}} been met with adversity, such as by English-only campaigns in some areas in the late 1990s. However, Navajo-immersion programs have cropped up across the Navajo Nation. Statistical evidence shows that Navajo-immersion students generally do better on standardized tests than their counterparts educated only in English. Some educators have remarked that students who know their native languages <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of pride and identity validation. Since 1989, Diné College, a Navajo tribal community college, has offered an associate degree in the subject of Navajo. This program includes language, literature, culture, medical terminology, and teaching courses; includes about 600 students per semester; and produces {{the highest number of}} Navajo teachers of any institution in the United States. One major university that teaches classes in the Navajo language is Arizona State University. In 1992, Young and Morgan published another major work on Navajo: Analytical Lexicon of Navajo, with the assistance of Sally Midgette (Navajo). This work is organized by root, the basis of Athabaskan languages.|$|E

500|$|The {{developers}} {{designed the}} game like a [...] "Japanese garden", where {{they attempted to}} remove all of the game elements that did not fit with the others, so the emotions they wanted the game to evoke would come through. This minimalism is intended to make the game feel intuitive to the player, so they can explore and <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of wonder without direct instructions. The story arc {{of the game is}} designed to explicitly follow Joseph Campbell's monomyth theory of narrative, or hero's journey, as well as to represent the stages of life, so as to enhance the emotional connection of the players as they journey together. In his D.I.C.E. speech, Chen noted that three of their 25 testers had cried upon completing the game.|$|E

[...] In 1939, the British translator and Sinologist Arthur Waley described the Zhuangzi as [...] "one of the most entertaining {{as well as one}} of the profoundest books in the world." [...] In the introduction to his 1994 translation of the Zhuangzi, the American Sinologist Victor H. Mair wrote: [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of injustice that the Dao De Jing is so well known to my fellow citizens while the Zhuangzi is so thoroughly ignored, because I firmly believe that the latter is in every respect a superior work." ...|$|E
500|$|During this period, some Straits Chinese {{began taking}} {{interest}} in local politics, especially in Penang, {{where there was}} an active Chinese secessionist movement.

Avoiding both UMNO and the MCA, they believed that while UMNO and Malay extremists were intent on extending Malay privileges and restricting Chinese rights, the MCA was too [...] "selfish", {{and could not be}} relied on. Uncomfortable about the merger of the Straits Settlements with Malaya, they did not <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of belonging in a [...] "Malaya for the Malays" [...] where they were not considered bumiputra ("sons of the soil").

Instead of the action simply coming to the player, it flows all around, and the player {{is the one who}} has to go and seek it. The scenes of these giant ships duking it out, with many gnat-like fighters swarming around in their little dances of death, have led reviewers to <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of epicness, comparable to reliving battles in science fiction series like Babylon 5 and Star Wars. Similarly, PC Gamer praised the scaling of ships and battles and said that they [...] " [...] as close to creating the feeling of a World War II naval battle in space as any game has ever come" [...] and that [...] "That's what fighter combat, in space or on Earth, should be all about.".|$|E
500|$|The {{religious}} {{music of}} the Barbadian Christian churches {{plays an important role}} in Barbadian musical identity, especially in urban areas. Many distinctive Barbadian musical and other cultural traditions derive from parodies of Anglican church hymns and British military drills. The British military performed drills to both provide security for the island's population, as well as intimidate slaves. [...] Modern Barbadian tea meetings, tuk bands, the Landship tradition and many folk songs come from slaves parodying the practices of white authorities. British-Barbadians used music for cultural and intellectual enrichment and to <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of kinship and connection with the British Isles through the maintenance of British musical forms. Plantation houses featured music as entertainment at balls, dances and other gatherings. For Afro-Barbadians, drum, vocal and dance music was an integral part of everyday life, and songs and performance practices were created for normal, everyday events, as well as special celebrations like Whitsuntide, Christmas, Easter, Landship and Crop Over. These songs remain a part of Barbadian culture and form a rich folk repertoire.|$|E

[...] His disappointment and confusion impacted his productivity; he produced few of the prints that were supposed to fund his stay, and the language barrier made it difficult to find buyers. [...] A Tokyo agent of his committed suicide after appropriating money from Kanae and other clients. [...] He could not bring himself to reveal his and his parents' financial situation, so he had another agent, Rokurō Watanabe, send money to Paris just so he could send it back to his parents, who were under pressure from a loan shark. [...] Along with his disappointment in the Western art world, Kanae witnessed first-hand the impact Japanese art had had there.
