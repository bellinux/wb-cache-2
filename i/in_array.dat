Also what {{and how many people}} there were slain and captured. Also the siege of the town of Tournay and other strange histories.The book contains a woodcut of their meeting and one of Maximilian in battle. The battle at Guinegate was described in this manner;"About twelve o'clock the French in three divisions appeared upon another hill (for here and there are little hills and valleys); {{and as soon as the}} Emperor knew it he got up and sent for the German horsemen, numbering scarcely 1,050, and the Burgundians, about 1,000 (or 2,000), and commanded to muster the troops and to keep the Germans by him. The French united in one division amounting to 10,000 (or 7,000) cavalry <b>in</b> <b>array</b> and fired guns at the Emperor's horsemen, but all went too high and did no hurt. Thus the Burgundians and certain English struck , and as they turned and the Emperor saw the Burgundians hard pressed, he at once ordered the German horsemen to attack on the flank; but before they struck the French had turned about and fled. Our horsemen pursued them until within a short mile of their camp and brought back the prisoners and banners hereafter indicated. When the Emperor saw that no more harm could be done them, and they were near their camp wherein were yet 20,000 foot, he retired all the men in good order and marched to the camp, remaining all night in the field. In this skirmish the English used no other cry than Burgundia." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{maximize}} tidal energy capture from a specific site free stream devices are situated <b>in</b> <b>arrays.</b> <b>In</b> an <b>array</b> the downstream {{evolution of the}} wake generated by a rotating tidal energy conversion device influences {{the performance of the}} device itself, the bypass flow to either side as well as the performance of any downstream device. As such it is important to design a turbine that can perform efficiently and effectively in these circumstances. Use of passively adaptive composite blades for horizontal axis tidal turbines has been shown to improve performance in fluctuating inflows. Active adaptation and/or bi-directional hydrofoil sections could be implemented in order to optimize performance throughout the tidal cycle. This paper considers the performance <b>in</b> an <b>array</b> of four free stream turbines implementing standard rigid blades, wholly bi-directional blades, passively adaptive blades and actively adaptive blades. The method used to evaluate the performance of tidal current turbines <b>in</b> <b>arrays</b> couples an inner domain solution of the blade element momentum theory with an outer domain solution of the Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes equations.
