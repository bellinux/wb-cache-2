25|$|The house slaves, {{in their}} moments of leisure, took the <b>dance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> field slaves and mimicked {{the dance of}} their masters.

They showed off by doing ceremonious bows, making grand entrances, {{sweeping}} movements, graceful and gentle gliding steps which imitated the elegance of the French. The rhythmic quality of the bélé drums added spicy and yet subtle sensuality to the movements. There are more than 14 types of bélé dances including the Grand bélé and Congo bélé, with each performed to its own rhythms and chants.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Karl von Frisch {{correlated}} {{the runs}} and turns of the <b>dance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> distance {{and direction of}} the food source from the hive. The orientation of the dance correlates to the relative position of the sun to the food source, and the length of the waggle portion of the run is correlated to the distance from the hive. Also, the more vigorous the display is, the better the food. There is no evidence that this form of communication depends on individual learning. Honeybees detect the dances of conspecifics by sensing near field sound and electric fields using the Johnston's organ.|$|E
