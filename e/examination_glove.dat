Twenty-seven subjects participated in the study. The subjects consisted of female dental and dental hygiene students from the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Dentistry. ^ One measure of manual dexterity and five measures of sensibility of the hand were used in this study. The O 2 ̆ 7 Connor Finger Dexterity Test was used to assess manual dexterity. The Weinstein Enhanced Sensory Test was used to assess pressure sensation thresholds. The DISK-CRIMINATOR was used to assess moving two-point discrimination. A BrUel 2 ̆ 6 Kjaer Vibro-Sensimeter System Type 9589 was used to assess vibration perception threshold (250 Hz) and flutter perception threshold (32 Hz). Tactile gnosis was used to assess functional capacity. ^ Prior to determining the effects of latex gloves on manual dexterity and sensibility of the hand an evaluation of the reliability of the tests used in this study was done. The evaluation of reliability indicated all six of the tests could be administered reliably. ^ The evaluation of the effect of latex <b>examination</b> <b>gloves</b> on sensibility and manual dexterity of the hand indicated pressure sensation thresholds were negatively affected (increased) by latex <b>examination</b> <b>gloves.</b> However, moving two-point discrimination, vibration perception threshold, flutter perception threshold, tactile gnosis and manual dexterity were not affected by latex <b>examination</b> <b>gloves.</b> An analysis of the combined dependent variables indicated the use of latex <b>examination</b> <b>gloves</b> did not affect overall hand function. ^ High grip force is a risk factor associated with cumulative trauma disorders.

40|$|Introduction Uninterrupted chest {{compressions}} are a {{key factor}} in determining resuscitation success. Interruptions to chest compression are often associated with defibrillation, particularly the need to stand clear from the patient during defibrillation. It has been suggested that clinical <b>examination</b> <b>gloves</b> may provide adequate electrical resistance to enable safe hands-on defibrillation in order to minimise interruptions. We therefore examined whether commonly used nitrile clinical <b>examination</b> <b>gloves</b> provide adequate resistance to current flow to enable safe hands-on defibrillation. Methods Clinical <b>examination</b> <b>gloves</b> (Kimberly Clark KC 300 Sterling nitrile) worn by members of hospital cardiac arrest teams were collected immediately following termination of resuscitation. To determine the level of protection afforded by visually intact gloves, electrical resistance across the glove was measured by applying a DC voltage across the glove and measuring subsequent resistance. Results Forty new unused gloves (control) were compared with 28 clinical (non-CPR) gloves and 128 clinical (CPR) gloves. One glove in each group had a visible tear and was excluded from analysis. Control gloves had a minimum resistance of 120 k? (median 190 k?) compared with 60 k? in clinical gloves (both CPR (median 140 k?) and non-CPR groups (median 160 k?)). Discussion Nitrile clinical <b>examination</b> <b>gloves</b> do not provide adequate electrical insulation for the rescuer to safely undertake ‘hands-on’ defibrillation and when exposed to the physical forces of external chest compression, even greater resistive degradation occurs. Further work is required to identify gloves suitable for safe use for ‘hands-on’ defibrillation...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Maintaining {{contact with}} the patient during {{defibrillator}} discharge has been proposed as a method for reducing no flow time but carries an associated risk of electrocution of the rescuer. This study describes an investigation to determine if typical clinical examination gloves possess the dielectric strength needed to prevent breakdown at defibrillation voltages; a factor essential to protect the rescuer. Methods Four types of <b>examination</b> <b>glove</b> typically used in a clinical environment were tested with two types of defibrillation waveform commonly used. For each type of glove, 10 samples were tested initially using a monophasic defibrillation waveform and then, using a fresh sample of gloves, with a Biphasic waveform. For each glove the number of shocks required before electrical breakdown occurred was recorded. Results Kimberly Clark KC 300 (nitrile), Kimberly Clark KC 500 purple (nitrile), PH Medisavers GN 90 (nitrile) and Bodyguards GL 6622 (Vinyl) were tested using a monophasic defibrillation waveform and broke down after a median of 1, 4. 5, 1 and 1 shocks respectively. The equivalent values for Biphasic defibrillator were 2, > 10, 2. 5 and 1 shocks.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Ultrasound (US) plaque {{characterization}} {{has great}} potential {{with regard to}} maximizing the information traditionally gathered with spectral Doppler examination. It can directly visualize plaque and quantify better features such as surface morphology, geometry, volume, and echotexture via B-mode and the three-dimensional (3 D) imaging mechanism. One of the major pitfalls of carotid imaging {{is the use of}} freehand manual manipulation. The application of angling, steering, as well as variability in the technical parameters, can increase the interobservation inconsistency. A limited number of commercial phantoms are available to teach this advanced technique but come at a high cost. We developed a home-produced phantom model to practice and teach carotid atherosclerotic disease imaging. We also investigated interobservation variability using two-dimensional (2 D) characterization and 3 D mechanical planimetry. This study presents a recipe to create an ultrasonic phantom that simulates a diseased carotid artery segment and how it can be used in identifying the 2 D and 3 D US interobservation variability. Methods: We created five tissue-like phantoms to simulate various types of diseased plaque segments. To simulate the plaque, a piece of frankfurter was cut and detailed to represent various forms of diseased plaque. Each mould contained dissimilar types of mimicked-plaque, including a softplaque, fissured, ulcerated, irregular surfaced, and calcified segment. We used a mixture of gelatin and Metamucil to mimic a previously published soft-tissue mixture. To create a vessel, we used a powder-free, nitrile <b>examination</b> <b>glove.</b> The frankfurter was held in place inside the middle finger of the glove using adhesive gel and filled with mineral oil. Preparation included interval refrigeration of the concoction of the mould. Trained sonographers imaged the plaque using a linear small parts probe for 2 D and a mechanical 3 D probe for 3 D US. Two neuroradiologists assessed the corresponding images and reported their findings including the internal plaque contents, volume, and geometry. Analysis was performed on the inter-observation and inter-reading variability. Results: Interobserver and interreader reliabilities were high, and plaque volume measurement variability decreased with increasing plaque volume. There was increased sensitivity and specificity for each plaque phantom with the use of 3 D versus 2 D alone. Neuroradiologists reports were 96 % sensitive and 97 % specific, respectively, when they used combined 2 D and 3 D US. Conclusion: We created a 2 D and 3 D vascular US carotid phantom. This phantom is an excellent educational tool to simulate various degrees of diseased carotid segments; moreover, it can be made easily and inexpensively and is reusable. This phantom represents the vessel anatomy and pathology extremely well. We implemented a standardized scanning protocol and created a plaque morphological worksheet to cover all plaque characterization criteria and achieve optimal imaging. Results indicated minimal interobservation and interreader variability. Additional studies are required to address the phantom's longevity and whether or not it can improve the sonographer's skills. 5 page(s...|$|E

Because of concerns related to latex allergy, an increasing trend toward the use of synthetic gloves made of materials other than latex is observable. However, currently it is unknown if the physical properties of different materials may influence bacterial passage {{in case of a}} glove puncture. Methods We examined 9 different medical <b>examination</b> <b>gloves</b> from various manufacturers made of nitrile (n[*]=[*] 4), latex (n[*]=[*] 3), or neoprene (n[*]=[*] 2). Additionally, 1 latex surgical glove each with and without antibacterial chlorhexidine gluconate coating and 1 synthetic surgical glove made of thermoplastic elastomer were included in the experiments. The studied materials were perforated following a standardized procedure, and direct bacterial passage was measured under dynamic conditions. Glove elasticity at 1 [*]cm up to 2. 5 [*]cm elongation was measured following EN 455 - 2. Results Nitrile gloves demonstrated higher material stiffness compared with latex <b>gloves.</b> Medical <b>examination</b> <b>gloves</b> made of nitrile and neoprene showed a 10 -fold higher bacterial passage through a standardized puncture compared with latex gloves. All surgical gloves showed a lower bacterial passage compared with the tested <b>examination</b> <b>gloves.</b> Conclusion Bacterial passage through punctures is correlated with the stiffness or elasticity of the glove material. Therefore, gloves made of latex may have an increased protective effect in case of a glove breach.

Materials and Methods: The experimental study was conducted in Central India. A total of 600 gloves, 120 each from five brands (Kaltex, Nulife, Smartcare, Handshield, Medi-image) were used. Thickness was measured using stereomicroscope. Permeability to fluids was evaluated through 0. 2 % erythrosine dye. Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC- 25923) was used to check for microbial permeability. Tactile sensibility was assessed by 2 -point discriminator test using 2 -point-calipers on 30 volunteers. Chi-square test and Binary logistic regression analysis were used. Results: Mean thickness of gloves was 0. 1333 (range: 0. 1028 - 0. 1799). Dye and microbial test showed 10. 6 % and 43. 3 % permeability of gloves, respectively. No significant difference was observed among brands. Thicker gloves (0. 1285 - 0. 1542) yielded lower touch sensibility (odds ratio: 0. 783, P < 0. 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} latex sensitisation among {{a large group of}} healthcare workers, study the occupational and non-occupational factors associated with latex allergy, and characterise latex exposure in air and by gloves. METHODS: All 2062 employees of a general hospital in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada who regularly used latex gloves were invited to participate in a cross sectional survey, representing the baseline phase of a prospective cohort morbidity study. Attempts were made to recruit employees who were diagnosed with latex allergy before the survey. Glove extracts were assayed for antigenic protein, and area and personal air samples were obtained on two occasions (summer and winter) to estimate exposure to airborne latex protein. A questionnaire on medical and occupational information was administered by an interviewer. Skin prick tests were performed with latex reagents, three common inhalants, and six foods. RESULTS: The mean (SD) latex protein concentrations were 324 (227) micrograms/g in powdered surgical gloves and 198 (104) micrograms/g in powdered <b>examination</b> <b>gloves.</b> Personal latex aeroallergen concentrations ranged from 5 to 616 ng/m 3. There was a total of 1351 (66 %) participants. The prevalence of positive latex skin tests was 12. 1 % (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 10. 3 % to 13. 9 %). This prevalence did not vary by sex, age, hospital, or smoking status but subjects who were latex positive {{were significantly more likely to}} be atopic (P < 0. 01). Participants who were latex positive were also significantly more likely to have positive skin tests to one or more foods (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) adjusted for atopy 12. 1, 95 % CI 7. 6 to 19. 6, P < 10 (- 9)). Work related symptoms were more often reported among latex positive people, and included hives (OR 6. 3, 95 % CI 3. 2 to 12. 5), eye symptoms (OR 1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 2 to 2. 8), and wheezy or whistling chest (OR 4. 7, 95 % CI 2. 8 to 7. 9). The prevalence of latex sensitivity was highest among laboratory workers (16. 9 %), and nurses and physicians (13. 3 %).

Polystyrene latex (PS) was synthesized by emulsion polymerization technique for blending with natural rubber. The maximum fraction of PS blended NR-LA or DPNR {{used to obtain}} a homogenous film was 20 % w/w. The 300 % modulus of PS blended NR film was increased before and after aging at 100 ºC for 22 hrs. The tensile strength and elongation at break were increased at NR/PS = 95 / 5 w/w and tended to decrease as PS blended fraction increased. DPNR films had a lower friction coefficient than NR-LA films. PS blended NR-LA or DPNR would decrease the friction coefficient of films. The rubber-surfaced friction is reduced. The extractable protein of NR-LA film was higher than 200 μg/g whereas that of DPNR film was lower than 50 μg/g. PS blended NR-LA and DPNR could reduce the extractable protein to less than 60 μg/g and 30 μg/g, respectively. The physical properties of PS blended NR-LA met ASTM D 3577 and ASTM D 3578 standards for dipping products of surgical <b>gloves</b> and <b>examination</b> <b>gloves</b> at the maximum fraction of PS 15 % w/w and 20 % w/w, respectively, whereas PS blended DPNR only met ASTM D 3577 standard at the maximum fraction of PS < 5 % w/w...|$|R
40|$|A new {{roughness}} perception {{test was}} designed to evaluate cutaneous sensibility. Blindfolded subjects explored a sample of sandpaper using one of two methods: stroking the sample (dynamic method) or applying pressure (static method). A range of samples of various grades were presented in a random order, and subjects scored each one in terms of perceived roughness. Each subject performed the test in three conditions – wearing latex and nitrile <b>examination</b> <b>gloves</b> and bare-handed. Mean normalised scores for each combination of sandpaper grade and hand condition were calculated. The coefficient of friction (COF) between each sample and glove (or bare finger) was measured, and the topography of each sample was analysed using a profilometer. It {{was found that the}} COF did not vary significantly across the samples, and so could not be related to perceived roughness. However, there were strong correlations between perceived roughness and surface topography (roughness average, particle diameter, particle spacing), particularly in the dynamic method. In the static method, most subjects did not perceive roughness differences below 800 [*]µm particle spacing. In both methods, there was a significant reduction in perceived roughness when gloves were donned, but {{no significant difference between the}} two glove types could be found. It was concluded that the dynamic method was a useful test for evaluating cutaneous sensibility. Further investigation of the relationship between friction and perceived roughness was recommended, using a wider range of sample materials...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. Glove wearing during patient {{treatment}} has {{been central to}} dental surgery infection control for over 15 years. However, {{little is known about}} the cutaneous effects of glove wearing on the hands of dental healthcare workers (DHCWs). The objective of this project was to assess the hand skin health of DHCWs before and after wearing gloves of two types and to compare this with a control group of non-DHCWs. Methods. Following a mailing to all dentists in the West of Scotland, 50 DHCWs who wore gloves during dental treatment procedures for a minimum of 8 h daily for at least 4 days per week were invited to participate in the project. The control group comprised 25 subjects who did not routinely use surgical or <b>examination</b> <b>gloves.</b> Hands were assessed by clinical examination and by transepidermal water loss at baseline, 1 month and 3 months. Results. Of the 50 DHCWs, 26 wore a non-powdered latex glove (Microtouch Powder-free: Johnson and Johnson, Arligton, TX, US), and 24 wore a nitrile glove (Hartalega SDN BHD, Malaysia) from the time of the baseline examination until the 3 -month examination. No differences were observed in hand skin health between the control group and the DHCWs at baseline, nor between those wearing the latex or nitrile gloves during the 3 month period of the study. Conclusion. It is concluded that the hand skin health of the DHCWs examined were no different from those of a control group of non-DHCWs, and that the wearing of the two types of gloves used in the 3 month study had no significant effect...|$|R
