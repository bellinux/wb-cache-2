5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E
5|$|French {{intelligence}} {{states that}} weapons manufacturer Conrad {{is involved in}} a sale, leading to Olivia returning to the sensory deprivation tank in order to find out more from Scott's memories. In a motel room they used to share, Scott talks to Olivia, scaring her into shooting him. Olivia next appears in an alleyway, where she follows Scott into a memory of him almost killing Conrad. He reveals that he, Hicks, and Marshall are all undercover government agents for the NSA, and tells Olivia to ask Hicks where the meeting is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> They awake Hicks, who tells them more about the weapons sale.|$|E

Things that are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>'appen</b> <b>to</b> people I know {{come to me}} in dreams, same as pore Bill's did. It's curious to me sometimes when I look round at you chaps, seeing you going about 'appy and comfortable, and knowing all the time 'orrible things that is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>'appen</b> <b>to</b> you. Sometimes it gives me the fair shivers." ...|$|R

5|$|From {{the start}} of the production, Atlus staff saw Shin Megami Tensei as a chance to create a game with the company's brand on it. The staff saw it as a remake of the {{previous}} Megami Tensei game; because of this, they knew what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> in the story, and the development went smoothly. The story went through multiple revisions, and many settings were inspired by the staff's personal lives. The character and demon designs were done by Kazuma Kaneko, who used mythical figures and multiple clothing styles in his designs. Reception and sales for the game have been highly positive, and its success helped launch Atlus as a developer and publisher, along with popularizing the Megami Tensei series.|$|E
5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I think after a while, they got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E
5|$|They {{are known}} for their {{elongated}} record titles, usually inspired by B movies. They have released three EPs, How Am I Supposed to Kill You If You Have All the Guns?

5|$|Smith {{hoped to}} be posted to Britain {{at the end of}} his training, and was {{initially}} told that this was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> but he was instead sent to the Middle East. He was despatched to Idku, a small RAF base near Cairo, in late 1942, from where he was posted to an operational training unit based at Baalbek in Lebanon. He spent six weeks there, flying over much of the Levant in a Hawker Hurricane fighter, before being posted to No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron to begin active service, again piloting Hurricanes. The squadron was stationed near the Iranian capital of Tehran when Smith joined it, but it almost immediately transferred to Kirkuk in Iraq, to help guard the oil wells and pipelines there. In March 1943, it was again committed to the Western Desert Campaign in North Africa, having previously served there during 1941–1942, and Smith served on this front as a Hurricane pilot. He was promoted to flying officer on 25 March 1943.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} {{steadily}} escalating development {{costs of the}} vehicle, Sinclair decided to raise capital by selling {{some of his own}} shares in Sinclair Research to fund a separate company that would focus on electric vehicles. A £12 million deal was reached in March 1983, of which £8.3 million was used to fund the establishment of the new Sinclair Vehicles company. Sinclair recruited Barrie Wills, a veteran former employee of the DeLorean Motor Company, to lead Sinclair Vehicles as its managing director. Although Wills initially expressed scepticism about the viability of an electric vehicle – his twenty-five years in the motor industry had convinced him that an electric car was never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> – Sinclair managed to convince him that the project would work. In 1984, Sinclair Vehicles' new head office was established in Warwick in the West Midlands, an area with a long-established link with the motor industry.|$|E
5|$|WWE 2K16 {{details the}} {{historical}} career of Steve Austin, {{from his days}} at ECW when he was angry that things were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> in a good sense for him to WCW when he and Brian Pillman began to become a strong tag team leading to Austin suffering injury and going through a rub shot in WWE as Stone Cold, an anti-hero that {{was not going to}} be tame into a corporate man. Video Packages contain commentary that was remixed from WWE '13 and WWE 2K14 with the exception of some not documented before. Through DLC, the WWE Hall of Fame showcase contains what if matches and some from WCW; these matches were announced on Oct 7th 2015 and to be released alongside the Deluxe Editions of the video game.|$|E

5|$|British {{producer}} Elizabeth Karlsen of Number 9 Films {{came across}} Nagy's script circa 2004, {{during which she}} co-produced Nagy's film Mrs. Harris with Christine Vachon of New York-based Killer Films. Berwin's rights to The Price of Salt expired in 2010, and Karlsen thereafter acquired the script. Berwin remained an executive producer on the film. Karlsen managed to convince Highsmith's estate to sign over the rights to her, closing down the deal with Tessa Ross in late 2011. She then persuaded a disillusioned and reluctant Nagy to come back on board. The producers hired a U.K. director who then dropped out because of scheduling conflicts. They later recruited Irish director John Crowley, who was announced in May 2012 along with the film's lead cast, Cate Blanchett and Mia Wasikowska, and involved producers, Karlsen and Stephen Woolley of Number 9 Films and Tessa Ross of Film4, who received executive producer credit. Carol was scheduled to commence photography in early 2013, until Crowley withdrew due to a scheduling conflict. Karlsen called Christine Vachon to discuss losing another director and Vachon told her that Haynes' new film was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> because its star had backed out of it. They then decided to approach Haynes. Vachon, Haynes' frequent collaborator, {{asked him if he}} would be interested and he received a copy of the screenplay. Two days later he committed to direct and Vachon joined the film as a producer. Haynes was announced {{as the director of the}} film in May 2013. Two days later, The Weinstein Company acquired U.S. distribution rights at the Cannes Film Festival.|$|E

5000|$|In 2012, {{when asked}} about climate change and {{regulating}} carbon dioxide, he stated: “When you start looking at trying to regulate something like carbon dioxide, which is a natural, biological process, you start running into areas of confusion” and “I think certainly over the millennia, we've seen changes in our climate both ways, and I think throughout the future millennia {{we will continue to}} see climate change that goes both ways. But the issue for this election is not what's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>happening</b> in the next 200 years, it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be what's <b>happening</b> in the next 12 months.” ...|$|R
25|$|Panic {{disorder}} is an anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks.

There may be ongoing worries about having further attacks and avoidance of places where attacks {{have occurred in the}} past.|$|E
25|$|On 8 April Haig, {{having learned}} of {{intelligence}} reports of German reserves massing in the British sector, tried again, asking his French liaison officer, General de Laguiche, to ask Foch to send French divisions {{to free up}} six British divisions to form a reserve in Flanders, but Weygand arrived at GHQ to tell Herbert Lawrence in person {{that this was not}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Wilson arrived in France on the morning of 9 April, just as the German offensive in Flanders was beginning.|$|E
25|$|The {{prominence}} of failed prophecy also lends {{support to the}} cult theory. NESARA supporters often tell their readers that the NESARA announcement is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> {{in a matter of}} days. These claims have been made too many times to enumerate, without ever coming to fruition. According to the documentary Waiting For NESARA, the claim was also made prior to March 2003 that George Bush was planning the war with Iraq only to further delay the NESARA announcement. It was prophesied that spiritual beings and UFOs would intervene with Bush's plans and prevent the war.|$|E
