500|$|In January 2005, it was {{revealed}} Elliott {{had been working on}} a new album. Two months later, Ciara confirmed she would appear on the album, singing and rapping on the potential first untitled single at the time. Elliott worked on The Cookbook with such producers as the Neptunes, Rich Harrison and Scott Storch. The album included only two songs produced by Timbaland, who produced most or all songs on Elliott's previous albums. She explained, [...] "Me and Tim, this like our sixth album, so <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> any further left, we gonna be on Mars somewhere. We've done everything it is to do. I think both of us came to a spot where we didn't know where to go with each other." [...] She said Timbaland was very involved with the album, supporting or opposing certain producers. Elliott went on to say, [...] "I was eight songs deep and I let Tim listen and he was like, 'Nah, you're going in the wrong direction. You trippin'.' I had to go back in the studio and come up with new records. , he was like, 'This is the Missy people are listening to.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{areas around}} Malvern Hill hosted much of Lee's army {{the night after}} the battle. Some of the Confederates were close enough to hear the sounds made by the Army of the Potomac {{retreating}} under cover of darkness, and see the lanterns of Northerners helping their wounded. The day after the Battle of Malvern Hill, Lee and Stonewall Jackson met President Jefferson Davis at Poindexter farm. They considered immediately pursuing McClellan; however, {{in view of the}} rain and confusion, Davis and Lee deemed large-scale pursuit of McClellan's army too risky. Jackson disagreed, saying, [...] "They have not all got away <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> immediately after them." [...] Jackson even had the bodies of the dead moved so that his soldiers had a clear line of attack when pursuing McClellan. However, Davis and Lee thought it necessary to rest the army. They did not completely rule out a pursuit though; Lee even ordered J. E. B. Stuart to reconnoiter McClellan's position for future attacks. Lee ordered Theophilus Holmes to move to Drewry's Bluff, and decided to keep the men on Malvern Hill through July 3 to forestall any potential Union attack against that location.|$|E
500|$|Prince Albert Victor died in 1892, but society {{gossip about}} his sex life continued. Sixty {{years after the}} scandal the {{official}} biographer of King George V, Harold Nicolson, was told by Lord Goddard, who was a twelve-year-old schoolboy {{at the time of}} the scandal, that Prince Albert Victor [...] "had been involved in a male brothel scene, and that a solicitor had to commit perjury to clear him. The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence, but was thereafter reinstated." [...] In fact, none of the lawyers involved in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off at the time, indeed most had very distinguished careers. However, Arthur Newton was struck off for 12 months for professional misconduct in 1910 after falsifying letters from another of his clients—the notorious murderer Harvey Crippen. In 1913, he was struck off indefinitely and sentenced to three years' imprisonment for obtaining money by false pretences. Newton may have invented and spread the rumours about Prince Albert Victor in an attempt to protect his clients from prosecution by forcing a cover-up. State papers on the case in the Public Record Office, released to the public in the 1970s, provide no information on the prince's involvement other than Newton's threat to implicate him. Hamilton Cuffe wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Augustus Stephenson, [...] "I am told that Newton has boasted that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> on a very distinguished person will be involved (PAV). I don't mean to say that I for one instant credit it—but in such circumstances as this one never knows what may be said, be concocted or be true." [...] Surviving private letters from Somerset to his friend Lord Esher, confirm that Somerset knew of the rumours but did not know if they were true. He writes, [...] "I can quite understand the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son's name being coupled with the thing... we were both accused of going to this place but not together... I wonder if it is really a fact or only an invention." [...] In his correspondence, Sir Dighton Probyn refers to [...] "cruel and unjust rumours with regard to PAV" [...] and [...] "false reports dragging PAV's name into the sad story". When Prince Albert Victor's name appeared in the American press, the New York Herald published an anonymous letter, almost certainly written by Charles Hall, saying [...] "there is not, and never was, the slightest excuse for mentioning the name of Prince Albert Victor." [...] Biographers who believe the rumours suppose that Prince Albert Victor was bisexual, but this is strongly contested by others who refer to him as [...] "ardently heterosexual" [...] and his involvement in the rumours as [...] "somewhat unfair".|$|E

2500|$|At this time, Pinzón and Columbus {{seemed quite}} close.

There is a clear rule. Not a citizen outside the United States; you don't get your foot in the door. But against you is that same fact. It seems rather contrary to an idea of a constitution with three branches that the executive {{would be free to}} do whatever they want, whatever they want without a check." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{called his}} team {{together}} {{the night before}} the Test began. His first words were [...] "Chaps, you have got to get stuck into this with me. I have not lost faith. We can win <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> out there to-morrow and get stuck right into it." [...] He told them that he knew they had not produced their English form. He told them that their batting, bowling, fielding and catching were too often just too bad to be true. Chosen, as they were, to represent their country, they obviously could do better. Brown's told them just what he thought of everything. He finished by saying that if they went on to the field on the morrow with confidence in themselves, they could do the job.|$|E

2500|$|... "In {{no other}} country in the world has the ground upon which those who {{advocate}} immediate demands propose to stand, grown so thin as it has grown in America.... Nowhere else in the world has the struggle between capital and labor narrowed down to as clear a point and as clear an issues as it has in America.... is the argument of vote-getting. It is the argument that today, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> before the laborers, we must offer them something right away. I answer to you that today, if we are to go into the field of competitive bidding for votes, either of the old political parties can outbid us. If we demand the government ownership of railways, telephones, and means of communication, if we demand the nationalization of the mines, what are we? A handful whose demand is but a hollow cry.|$|E
2500|$|Different Test playing {{nations had}} {{different}} point of view about this structural change in the way Test Cricket has been played. Bangladesh was the voice one to voice its concern in opposing this. [...] "We do not support this system," [...] Mahbubul Anam, Vice President, Bangladesh Cricket Board said. [...] "We believe that more we play against competitive sides, the better we will get. If we didn't play against better standard sides in ODIs, we wouldn't have come this far. We were the king of the jungle from where we achieved the Test status. We were given a reality check when we were promoted to the highest level. I feel that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> backwards, our cricket will regress." [...] Should this happen, Bangladesh, who are ranked ninth, are likely to slip into Division Two and settle for lesser Tests against top cricketing nations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{creative}} {{side of the}} Foundation {{involves the}} usual application process, but in addition, the Foundation began with [...] "an advisory committee made up of three... people working in the industry" [...] whose input is sought {{on how best to}} proceed with each application. Submissions are evaluated prior to Laird's involvement, and then he makes the ultimate decisions based on their recommendations. Laird stated in 1993 that: [...] "...knock on wood, God willing, and the creek don't rise, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> on for another couple of decades, and I'm able to put more money into the basic funding of the Xeric Foundation, then {{the amount of money that}} can be given out can really be raised significantly." [...] He hoped that ultimately the figure can be raised from [...] "thousands of dollars" [...] to [...] "hundreds of thousands of dollars," [...] to support an increasing number of large and small projects.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, {{the private}} French COMETA report (written {{primarily}} by military defense analysts) stated the conclusion regarding UFO phenomena, that a [...] "single hypothesis sufficiently {{takes into account}} the facts and, for the most part, only calls for present-day science. It is the hypothesis of extraterrestrial visitors." [...] The report noted issues with formulating the extraterrestrial hypothesis, likening its study to the study of meteorites, but concluded that although it was far from the best scientific hypothesis, [...] "strong presumptions exist in its favour". The report also concludes that the studies it presents [...] "demonstrate the almost certain physical reality of completely unknown flying objects with remarkable flight performances and noiselessness, apparently operated by intelligent [...] … Secret craft definitely of early origins (drones, stealth aircraft, etc.) can only explain a minority of cases. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> back far enough in time, we clearly perceive the limits of this explanation." ...|$|E
2500|$|It's {{not really}} revenge, I think, if anything, it's redemption. But it's more about us, it's {{not so much}} about Tennessee. We didn't play very well last year when we went there and {{probably}} got caught a little too much focusing on them and the environment and that type of thing. So at practice this year, we're really just focusing on ourselves <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> out and play to our potential then we'll have a chance to be successful. Last year we didn't come close to our potential so we had no chance. Of course it's a big game like it was last year, two ranked teams, so there's a lot of people watching it to see what's going on. It wasn't that we lost the game last year, I think it was the way we lost the game last year that was the devastating part of it, that hung with us so long.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 May 2013 Ecaterina Andronescu, former Minister of Education, professor, {{and member}} of the Social Democratic Party (Romania) {{declared}} in an interview when questioned about legalizing [...] same-sex marriage the following: [...] "You know, to answer this questions it's necessary to give a more extended commentary. On one hand I respect human rights, I know that my freedoms ends where I am interfering with yours, {{but at the same time}} each of us has a mission on this earth, we must ensure future generations and this occurs naturally by marriage between men and women. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> further we would understand that at some point humanity will come to an end if same-sex marriage is proliferated too extensively.

2500|$|Rabbi Ishmael cited [...] {{as one of}} ten a fortiori (kal va-chomer) {{arguments}} {{recorded in}} the Hebrew Bible: (1) In [...] Joseph's brothers told Joseph, [...] "Behold, {{the money that we}} found in our sacks' mouths we brought back to you," [...] and they thus reasoned, [...] "how then should we steal?" [...] (2) In [...] Moses told God, [...] "Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened to me," [...] and reasoned that surely all the more, [...] "How then shall Pharaoh hear me?" [...] (3) In [...] Moses said to the Israelites, [...] "Behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against the Lord," [...] and reasoned that it would follow, [...] "And how much more after my death?" [...] (4) In [...] "the Lord said to Moses: ‘If her (Miriam's) father had but spit in her face,'" [...] surely it would stand to reason, [...] "‘Should she not hide in shame seven days?'" [...] (5) In [...] the prophet asked, [...] "If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you," [...] is it not logical to conclude, [...] "Then how can you contend with horses?" [...] (6) In 1 Samuel [...] David's men said to him, [...] "Behold, we are afraid here in Judah," [...] and thus surely it stands to reason, [...] "How much more then <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> to Keilah?"

[...] (9) In [...] "The king said to Esther the queen: ‘The Jews have slain and destroyed 500 men in Shushan the castle,'" [...] and it thus stands to reason, [...] "‘What then have they done {{in the rest of the}} king's provinces?'" [...] (10) In [...] God came to the prophet saying, [...] "Behold, when it was whole, it was usable for no work," [...] and thus surely it is logical to argue, [...] "How much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is singed?" ...|$|E
