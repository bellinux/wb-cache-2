5|$|Prior to Cyclone Magda's arrival, several {{severe weather}} {{warnings}} were issued for the coastline of Western Australia. Although the storm made landfall with winds of 130km/h (80mph), damage was limited {{due to the}} sparsely populated region <b>it</b> <b>struck.</b> The most severe damage was defoliation around Kuri Bay. Following its usage, the name Magda was retired and replaced with Megan.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{weakened}} to EF2 {{strength as}} <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> Flintstone {{further to the}} northeast, but still resulted in major damage. Numerous trees and power lines were downed, 7 homes were destroyed, 26 sustained major damage, and 35 sustained minor damage in the Flintstone area. The tornado continued northeast, weakening to EF0 strength and dissipating in Fort Oglethorpe.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed the aircraft had impacted birds during take-off. Due to loss {{of power in the}} left engine, the flight crew were unable to control their aircraft before <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> the roof of the apartment building. The investigation further determined the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and officials at DeKalb–Peachtree Airport were aware of the danger of birds at the airport after a landfill site had opened {{in the vicinity of the}} airport ten years before the accident.|$|E

5|$|At 10:45, the scuttling charge detonated {{in the bow}} and {{exploded}} the forward ammunition magazines. The bow was badly mangled; in about half an hour, the ship had taken on enough water to sink. As <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> the sea floor, the bow was torn {{from the rest of}} the ship, which rolled over to starboard. As the rest of the hull settled below the waves, a second scuttling charge exploded in the ship's engine rooms.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September, the 37th Battalion {{departed}} {{for the island}} of Vella Lavella, west of Guadalcanal. The {{southern part of the}} island was held by the United States Army while the Japanese continued to hold coastal positions in the north. The battalion landed on the island on 18 September and four days later, <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> out for the north. A series of amphibious landings along {{the eastern side of the}} island was planned while the 35th Battalion did the same around the western side.|$|E
5|$|Incidents of waterspouts causing {{severe damage}} and {{casualties}} are rare. However, {{there have been}} several notable examples. The Malta tornado in 1555 was the earliest record of a deadly waterspout. <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> the Grand Harbour of Valletta, sinking four galleys, numerous boats, and claiming hundreds of lives. The 1851 Sicily Tornadoes were twin waterspouts that made landfall in western Sicily, ravaging the coast and countryside before ultimately dissipating back again over the sea.|$|E

5|$|Part of the Ebenezer Avery House {{history is}} how {{it came to be}} used after the battle while its owner was absent. Some of the wounded from the battle, those unable to walk, {{including}} Stephen Hempstead, were taken prisoner and placed on a wagon with others to be taken down to the fleet. The British men allowed the wagon to run down the hill, where it stopped when <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> a tree, throwing some of the men off the wagon and aggravated their injuries.|$|E
5|$|Still {{maintaining}} {{strong winds}} {{by the time}} <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> Canada, the former hurricane washed one boat ashore, left three missing, and capsized one. One person was presumed killed when his boat sunk in Lockeport, Nova Scotia. The storm dropped heavy rainfall across the region, including 1.1in (27mm) in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, and about 3in (75mm) in 15hours in Gagetown, New Brunswick; there, the rains flooded roads and damaged crops. At Harvey Station in the same province, high rainfall washed out a 75ft (22m) portion of a rail line.|$|E
5|$|The 1884 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was one of}} only three Atlantic {{hurricane season}}s, along with 1852 and 1858, in which every known tropical cyclone attained hurricane status. Overall, four tropical cyclones developed, three of which made landfall. The first system was initially observed over the northwestern Atlantic Ocean on September1. <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> Newfoundland the following day, but impact there is unknown. On September3, the next hurricane developed, though it did not effect land in its duration. The third hurricane struck Georgia, accompanied by damaging waves in north Florida.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reports from}} the crash site speculated that the Amana was already on fire when <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> the tops of trees because those trees, and pieces of the aircraft's left wing torn off in the impact with them, showed signs of scorching. Several eyewitnesses reported seeing flames in the sky before the aircraft struck the ground. Department of Civil Aviation investigators discounted this speculation because {{only one of the}} Amana's push-button engine fire extinguishers had activated and this had most likely occurred during the crash or the fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight was}} {{operated}} {{for the purpose}} of maintaining the currency of the instrument rating of two of the airline's pilots. Shortly after takeoff and only seconds after climbing through , the plane began banking to the right. It continued to roll through 90degrees; the nose then dropped suddenly and moments later <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> the ground. All three members of the flight crew were killed upon impact.|$|E
5|$|The name King was {{not used}} again after the season, {{although}} {{it was on the}} naming list for 1951 and 1952 due to being part of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. The Phonetic Alphabet was decommissioned in 1953 in favor of using female names. Based on population growth in south Florida, it is estimated that a storm identical to Hurricane King would cause $2.8billion in insured damage if <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> in 2001, with the total roughly split between Broward and Miami-Dade counties.|$|E

5|$|The {{remains of}} Debby {{maintained}} plenty of intensity over northern Europe, and on September 21 <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> northern parts of Finland (where {{it was named}} storm Mauri) {{as one of the}} most powerful windstorms in the country's recorded history. Winds over 90 mph (145 km/h) felled millions of cubic miles of forest, and a storm surge severely damaged the cities of Kemi and Tornio, claiming two lives.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Gordon's {{path from}} the Philippines to China, the storm caused {{widespread}} damage and loss of life. Across the Philippines, 90 people {{were killed by the}} typhoon and an estimated 120,000 people were left homeless. Though a weaker storm when <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> China, damage was more severe due to extensive flooding. Several coastal cities were completely inundated. Throughout the country, at least 200 people died and losses reached 1.2billion yuan ($319million USD). Additionally, 14 people drowned offshore and 2 others died in Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Beryl was {{the third}} {{tropical}} storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season. Developing from a tropical disturbance on July 18, it tracked generally northward, and strengthened to attain peak winds of 60mph (95km/h) under generally favorable conditions. After turning to the northeast, Beryl weakened over cooler waters. On July 21 <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> the island of Nantucket, and shortly thereafter it became extratropical. The extratropical remnants continued northeastward through Nova Scotia, and on July 22 it merged with an approaching cold front.|$|E

5|$|While the Beagle {{surveyed}} {{the coasts of}} South America from February 1832 to September 1835, Darwin made several trips inland and found extensive evidence that the continent was gradually rising. After witnessing an erupting volcano from the ship, he experienced the 1835 Concepción earthquake. In the following months he speculated that as the land was uplifted, {{large areas of the}} ocean bed subsided. <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> him that this could explain the formation of atolls.|$|E
5|$|A storm system {{moved to}} the {{northern}} and central Great Plains region during the day, as strong winds helped push a moist air mass northward ahead of the system. Thunderstorms developed during the afternoon ahead of a cold front from southeast South Dakota into central Kansas. Strong winds along with instability in the atmosphere created favorable conditions for supercell development {{with the potential to}} produce strong tornadoes. At approximately 6:35 pm CDT (2335 UTC) a tornado hit the Little Sioux Scout Ranch in Little Sioux, Iowa, killing four Boy Scouts after a chimney collapsed on them and injuring 48others. The camp received a tornado warning 12minutes before <b>it</b> <b>struck.</b> There were 93campers and 25staff members at the camp. The campers were between 13and 18 years old and were attending a leadership training camp. The tornado was rated EF3on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave exited western Africa on August13, {{which developed}} into Tropical Storm Baker {{east of the}} Lesser Antilles on August18. It moved northwestward and later turned to the west, attaining hurricane status on August21. The next day, the hurricane attained Category 2 intensity just as it crossed over Antigua, where heavy damage was reported. More than 100homes were damaged or destroyed, which left thousands homeless. Afterward, the hurricane began to weaken, and later on August22 its winds decreased to tropical storm status. The cyclone then struck Montserrat as a strong tropical storm. The next day <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> southwestern Puerto Rico, and shortly thereafter weakened into a tropical depression, passing over the Dominican Republic. Baker turned more to the west, re-attaining tropical storm status before striking eastern Cuba on August24. In Cuba, 37 people died, and the property losses reached several million dollars.|$|E
