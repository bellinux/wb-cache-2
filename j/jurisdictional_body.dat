50|$|Governor Wentworth's land grants in {{the area}} that is today Vermont were {{considered}} controversial at the time and since the early 1750s New York, which also laid claim to the area, had challenged the validity of town charters granted by Wentworth. Between 1764 and 1770, in a series of legal decisions handed down by England's Board of Trade and the New York Supreme Court of Judicature, New York was found to be the proper <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>body</b> for the area and Wentworth's charters were invalidated. New York immediately began redistricting the area by land patent, putting Westford within the now-extinct Charlotte County (formed 1772), and requiring residents to repurchase their land from New York in order to retain legal title. The residents of Westford (together with residents of the other New Hampshire Grant towns) protested this ruling and petitioned New York for the confirmation of Wentworth's town grants. In response New York declared that it would halt further subdivision of settled areas until clarification of King George III's intent was made clear. Before such clarification could be made, the American Revolutionary War (1775) interrupted matters and shortly afterward in 1777, Vermont seceded from New York and England to form the Republic of Vermont. New York's redistricting was forgotten and Westford solidified its position as a town within Vermont's western County of Bennington (founded in 1779, and later splitting the area containing Westford into Rutland in 1781, Addison in 1785, and ultimately Chittenden County in 1787). Westford would remain part of Chittenden County during the state's 1791 entrance to the United States as its 14th state and through to the present.|$|E
40|$|This short {{excursion}} in {{the history}} of the control over the constitutionality of laws in Romania, shows us that, in the period prior to 1912, in Romania, there used to be an incipient and accidental form of control of constitutionality, exercised by the Court of Cassation.

The socialist constitutions stipulated the political control over the constitutionality of laws, exercised by the Grand National Assembly, and, in 1991, the Romanian constituent legislator implemented, for the first time in Romania, the institution of the control over the constitutionality of laws, exercised by an independent and specialised <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>body,</b> appointed by the Constitutional Court...|$|E

40|$|Tese de doutoramento em Direiro, apresentada à Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de CoimbraNão sendo um Estado (nomeadamente, federal), a União Europeia apresenta-se antes como uma associação sui generis de Estados soberanos desprovida da competência das competências e de um poder constituinte, atributos que permanecem nos respetivos Estados membros. Nessa medida, a sua instituição jurisdicional - o Tribunal de Justiça da União Europeia - diferentemente do que ocorre com os supremos tribunais federais (v. g. o Suprem Court norte-americano ou o Bundesverfassungsgericht alemão), não funciona (nem poderia) como uma instância de apelo das decisões proferidas pelos órgãos jurisdicionais dos Estados membros; igualmente, não dispõe de poderes que lhe permitam invalidar ou reformular tais decisões, tal como não pode invalidar os atos nacionais que se afigurem contrários ao direito da União. Na verdade, a prossecução das atribuições da União Europeia rege-se pelo princípio da competência de atribuição, que, extensível ao exercício das competências das suas instituições, baliza a atuação dos órgãos integrados no Tribunal de Justiça da União Europeia, de forma a que eles atuem somente no quadro competencial que os Tratados (maxime o Tratado sobre o Funcionamento da União Europeia) preveem. Tal, porém, não obsta a que esses órgãos tenham a seu cargo um {{relevante}} papel na realização da tutela jurisdicional efetiva da ampla legalidade europeia, a qual, por sua vez, se subdivide entre objetiva (ou estrita) legalidade e pretensões de natureza subjetiva (direitos, principalmente fundamentais, e interesses) reconhecidas pela respetiva ordem, sobretudo aos particulares, e cujo respeito é condição da legalidade dos atos das instituições. As ações por incumprimento, por omissão e de indemnização, bem como o recurso de anulação, típicos instrumentos processuais do tradicional contencioso da União, são instaurados com vista a alcançar tal móbil. Não obstante, tendo em conta as limitações decorrentes do referido princípio, os órgãos jurisdicionais nacionais dos Estados membros também desempenham uma função essencial, por ventura preponderante, na prossecução da referida tutela jurisdicional efetiva, tendo sido erigidos em órgãos jurisdicionais comuns de aplicação do direito da União Europeia. Sobretudo através do reenvio prejudicial, mas também mediante o recurso de anulação, do principal órgão da instituição jurisdicional da União - o Tribunal de Justiça - têm emanado vários arestos que enunciaram e delimitaram essa competência, a qual implicou uma alteração no paradigma da atuação dos tribunais dos Estados membros, uma vez que estes passaram a desdobrar-se funcionalmente entre órgãos jurisdicionais nacionais que zelam pela salvaguarda da respetiva ordem interna, e órgãos jurisdicionais da União velando pela proteção do respetivo direito. O presente trabalho debruça-se sobre a temática da tutela jurisdicional efetiva na União Europeia. Sugere-se uma noção da mesma, analisam-se os seus pressupostos e decorrências, apontam-se propostas de melhoramento do sistema de garantia judicial da juridicidade da União, tendo por referência o quadro jurídico-institucional introduzido pelo Tratado de Lisboa, sem ignorar os tratados que o antecederam; comentam-se aspetos dogmáticos bem como questões práticas que, marcadas sobretudo pela chancela do Tribunal de Justiça, contribuíram para o {{status quo}} do tema.

Not being a State (namely Federal), the European Union comes forward as a sui generis association of sovereign Nations without {{the competence of}} competences and a constituent power that are attributes belonging to the respective member States. In that regard, its jurisdictional institution - the European Union Court of Justice - unlike it occurs with federal supreme courts (e. g. the North American Supreme Court or the German Bundesverfassungsgericht), does not work (nor it should) as an appeal body for {{the decisions of the}} <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bodies</b> of the Member States; likewise, it does not hold any powers that allow an invalidation or restructuring of those decisions, as it cannot invalidate national acts appearing in conflict to the Union law. Actually, the pursuit of the European Union assignments is ruled by the principle of power of action that, being extended to its institutions competences, limits the activity of the bodies that are integrated in the European Union Court of Justice in a way they act only within the competence framework that Treaties predict (particularly the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union). However, that does not prevent those to bodies have a relevant role in the fulfillment of the effective jurisdictional protection of the broad European legality, which, in turn, is subdivided between objective (or strict) legality and ambitions of a subjective nature (rights, mainly fundamental rights and interests) recognized by the respective order, mainly considering individuals, whose respect is a legality condition of institutional acts. Infringement actions, by omission or indemnity, as well as the action for annulment that are typical procedure instruments of the traditional Union litigation, are implemented in order to achieve such motive. In spite of that, considering the limitations arising from the above mentioned principle, domestic <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bodies</b> of Member States also perform an important role, perhaps prominent, in the pursuit of the effective jurisdictional protection, appearing in common <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bodies</b> of application of European Union law. Mainly through preliminary ruling, but also through action for annulment of {{the main body of the}} Union jurisdictional institution - the Court of Justice - several court decisions have come to the surface and have cited and delimited that competence, which implied a paradigm shift in the action of European Member courts as they started to functionally unfold into national <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bodies</b> that ensure the protection of the respective internal order, and the union <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>bodies</b> protecting the respective law. The present study approaches the topic of effective jurisdictional protection in the European Union. We suggest a concept for it, analyzing its assumptions and effects, proposing improvements for the legal guarantee of the Union judiciality and having by reference the institutional-legal framework introduced by the Lisbon Treaty, without ignoring the previous treaties; we also comment dogmatic aspects as well as practical issues marked by the Court of Justice, that have contributed to the status quo of the subject.

Which constitutional provision should prevail: the one set out in article 5, XXXVIII (d), which states that malicious crimes against life are subject to trial by jury, or any other constitutional rule vesting another <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>body</b> with authority to judge an accused who exercises a given position or mandate? The Brazilian Federal Supreme Court (STF) had already tackled this issue and consolidated its stand in Precedent 721. But the assumptions underlying the STF rationale remained a bone of contention. After all, it stands to reason that, in favoring the special jurisdiction by force of position in detriment to trial by jury, perhaps this approach ran counter the most well-ingrained tenets of the Brazilian Constitution by downplaying the importance of trial by jury, which epitomizes the maxim that all power emanates from the people. This work thus makes a historical study of this issue and points out the relevant role played by people s courts in cementing democratic values. Such background is followed by an elaboration on the grounds and precepts of the current rule of law system, to herald the trial by jury as a proper measure of the very dignity of human person. Consequently, this work concludes favorably on the special jurisdiction of trial by jury, which shall prevail over the constitutional jurisdiction by force of positio...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Reports of {{childhood}} emotional maltreatment have increased greatly {{over the past}} decade. The objective {{of this research was}} to determine the types of emotional maltreatment substantiated in a community of US Army families residing temporarily in Germany. Such a description may help to improve the understanding of how a <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>body</b> defines emotional maltreatment in day-to-day practice. Method: Data were obtained from a review of the minutes of case review committees (CRCs) for 181 cases of child emotional abuse in 1997 – 1998. We determined the type, number, and severity of incidents, the substantiation rate, and the situations to which children were exposed. Results: The most frequently substantiated type of incident was witnessing domestic violence, 60 % of all cases. Primary emotional abuse was found in 26 % of cases, while emotional abuse in conjunction with child physical abuse or child neglect was found in 14 % of cases. The more severe the case, the more likely it was to be substantiated. Conclusions: Emotional maltreatment was substantiated more as a single type than in combination with other forms of maltreatment. Seeing emotional abuse as a single entity may allow clinicians to focus on a relationship or situation (such as spouse abuse) that is potentially harmful to a child. However, recognizing the emotionally abusive aspects of child physical abuse and neglect could allow an expanded treatment plan that could include treatment of the emotionally abusive behavior to strengthen the relationship of the caregiver to the child, in addition to the focus on the physical abuse and neglect...|$|E

Xavier Arbos Marin (Universitat de Girona), Chris Himsworth (University of Edinburgh), Ruth Rubio Marin (EUI), Jacques Ziller (Supervisor, former EUI, Università di Pavia) This thesis aims to {{highlight}} {{the importance of the}} organisation and functioning of the judicial power in complex or composite polities and its relevance as a determinative element of the complex or composite nature of the polity itself. For this, it carries out a comparative analysis of the organisation and functioning of the judicial power in three models which - whilst all sharing the duality in the executive and legislative powers - present very a very different structure: Spain, the United States and the United Kingdom. This comparison requires the construction of a theoretical framework for the analysis of judicial federalism, which in current literature has still not been fully developed. On the basis of the existing theoretical instruments for the analysis of political federalism, a concept of "judicial federalism" is constructed, characterised by two main features: the geographical distribution of judicial power, and the granting of a sphere of judicial autonomy (understood as a combination of institutional autonomy, jurisdictional autonomy and governmental autonomy) to both the federation and the component units. An initial overview of these issues highlights the minimum or common element in all models of judicial federalism is the existence of a "supreme court" at both levels. The main part of the study focuses, then, on the higher courts of the component units and their relations with the higher <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>body</b> of the federation. In addition, a final chapter is included which compares the interrelation between constitutional review and judicial federalism in the selected models...|$|E

40|$|The {{principle}} of the autonomy of religious cults from the state is found {{in many of the}} Constitutions of European states and it has also been asserted by ECHR. In the case of Romania, this principle was noted for the first time by the 1869 Organic Statute of the Romanian Greek Orthodox Church of Hungary and Transylvania. This was not the case after 1918 when the term autonomy cannot be found in the 1923 Constitution, the 1928 Law on the general regime of religions or in the 1925 Statute of the Romanian Orthodox Church. The period of the communist regime marked the same absence of Church autonomy from the state in constitutional or canonical law. Only with the 1991 Constitution this principle is constitutionally guaranteed by Article 29, paragraph 5.

50|$|The Ortsgemeinde of Heimweiler {{came into}} being in 1969 through the merger of the two {{formerly}} self-administering municipalities of Heimberg and Krebsweiler. Archaeological finds from the Early Roman cremation grave near Krebsweiler and the prehistoric barrow in Heimberg’s outlying countryside show that there were early settlers within what are now both Heimweiler’s constituent communities. Like most of the district’s places, Heimberg’s and Krebsweiler’s foundings might have come about during the “opening up of the newer settlement area” (7th to 12th centuries). In 1375, both Krebsweiler and Heimberg had their first documentary mention as Krebeswilre and Heymberch. Both villages belonged until the late 18th century to the Amt of Naumburg. The two together formed an Ingericht (“in-court”) within the court district of Becherbach. This mediaeval <b>jurisdictional</b> and administrative <b>body,</b> which was coterminous with the parish of Becherbach, might well first {{have been subject to}} Raugravial administration, which beginning in the 14th century passed to the Counts of Sponheim-Kreuznach. After that comital house died out, the Amt of Naumburg passed to joint administration under the Electorate of the Palatinate and the Margraviate of Baden. In 1776, the Amt passed wholly to the latter. At the mediaeval Ingericht of Krebsweiler and Heimberg in the Late Middle Ages, the Lords of Heinzenberg held a share of the rights, which Tilmann von Heinzenberg sold Waldgrave Otto von Kyrburg in 1375. Economically, the villagers of Krebsweiler and Heimberg turned to Kirn, where, to support the town’s market, the so-called Zollhafer (a toll in oats) still had to be paid in 1579 to the Lords of Steinkallenfels. According to a 1785 description of the Amt of Naumburg, 30 houses then stood in Krebsweiler in which all together 32 families lived. The houses were said in this description to be “small and nasty, although the village was well-off”. Krebsweiler was the main wine centre in the Amt of Naumburg, with a yearly yield of up to 40 Fuder (“tuns”; roughly 40 000 L) of wine. The nicest house, or so it was said, was the Barth’sches Haus. Heimberg counted only 16 bungalows in those days and a like number of families. The greater part of these twin villages’ population was Protestant-Reformed. After the German lands on the Rhine’s left bank were overrun and occupied by French Revolutionary troops, the subsequent new administrative order, on the French Revolutionary model, put Heimberg and Krebsweiler together in the Mairie (“Mayoralty”) of Hundsbach. After Napoleon’s downfall and the implementation of a new administrative order by the Congress of Vienna, this local administrative arrangement continued in 1815 as an Oberschultheißerei, but in the 1820s, the seat was moved back to Becherbach, which thereafter stood as the seat of the Hesse-Homburg Bürgermeisterei (“Mayoralty”) of Becherbach in the Oberamt of Meisenheim. In 1866, the Oberamt of Meisenheim passed to the Kingdom of Prussia, which in 1869 raised the Oberamt to a Prussian district. Both Heimweiler’s constituent communities remained in the Amt of Becherbach, which became part of the Bad Kreuznach district in 1932, until 1940, when it was dissolved. Then, Heimberg and Krebsweiler passed to the Amt of Kirn-Land, in which they remained, each as a self-administering municipality, until 1969. After the two villages were amalgamated to form the new municipality of Heimweiler, they also found themselves grouped into a newly formed Verbandsgemeinde that also bore the name Kirn-Land.|$|R
