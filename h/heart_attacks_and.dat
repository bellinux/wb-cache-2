5|$|Aspirin's {{popularity}} declined {{after the}} development of acetaminophen/paracetamol in 1956 and ibuprofen in 1962. In the 1960s and 1970s, John Vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin's effects, while clinical trials and other studies from the 1960s to the 1980s established aspirin's efficacy as an anti-clotting agent that {{reduces the risk of}} clotting diseases. Aspirin sales revived considerably in the last decades of the twentieth century, and remain strong in the twenty-first with widespread use as a preventive treatment for <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>and</b> strokes.|$|E
5|$|Several {{subsequent}} studies put aspirin's effectiveness as a heart drug on firmer ground, but {{the evidence}} was not incontrovertible. However, in the mid-1980s, with the relatively new technique of meta-analysis, statistician Richard Peto convinced the U.S. FDA {{and much of the}} medical community that the aspirin studies, in aggregate, showed aspirin's effectiveness with relative certainty. By the end of the 1980s, aspirin was widely used as a preventive drug for <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>and</b> had regained its former position as the top-selling analgesic in the U.S.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} deep frying food is {{generally}} detrimental to its nutritional value. The oils that foods absorb in their batter typically contain {{large amounts of}} fats, especially saturated fats and trans fats. Consumption of large amounts of saturated and trans fats {{has been linked to}} a higher risk for some cancers including prostate cancer. Eating deep-fried foods has also been linked to higher cholesterol levels, obesity, <b>heart</b> <b>attacks,</b> <b>and</b> diabetes. Deep-fried foods cooked at certain temperatures can also contain acrylamide, a possible carcinogen.|$|E
5|$|Thrombolysis is enzymatic {{destruction}} of blood clots. This {{is achieved by}} the administration of a drug (such as urokinase or alteplase) that activates plasmin, an enzyme that occurs naturally {{in the body and}} digests clots when activated. Thrombolysis is an accepted treatment for <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>and</b> stroke unrelated to dissection. In cervical artery dissection, only small case series are available. The thrombolytic drug is administered either intravenously or during cerebral angiography through a catheter directly into the affected artery. The data indicates that thrombolysis is safe, but its place in the treatment of VAD is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|However, {{several of}} the new COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx), have been {{withdrawn}} in the last decade, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors {{increase the risk of}} heart attack and stroke. Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of PGI2 is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>and</b> other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.|$|E

5|$|Along Long Island, {{the high}} storm surge flooded {{hundreds}} of streets and caused heavy beach erosion. High winds downed thousands {{of trees and}} damaged hundreds of homes, causing widespread power outages. About 1.5 {{million people in the}} state lost power, including two-thirds of the Long Island Lighting Company customers, {{making it one of the}} worst power outages in the state. There were four deaths on Long Island, two of whom related to <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>and</b> the other two related to fallen trees. There were also 14 injuries in the region, many of them due to downed tree branches. In the New York mainland, heavy rainfall flooded rivers and alleviated drought conditions. Rough waves damaged boats and docks along the Hudson River. Unsettled weather contributed to a traffic fatality and an airplane crash that killed one in the New York mainland.|$|E
5|$|Before his death, in 1976 Blair bought O'Hara {{a travel}} magazine, the Virgin Islander, which {{she began to}} edit from their home {{for many years in}} St. Croix. She sold it in 1980 to USA Today {{to spend more time with}} her {{daughter}} and grandson Conor (born 1970). She passed on the airline business the following year, which by this time was chartering 120 flights a day with a fleet of 27 planes. O'Hara had had considerable prior experience with business as from the 1940s she ran a clothing store in Tarzana, Los Angeles, operating under her name, specializing in dresses for women. O'Hara increasingly spent time in Glengarriff on the southwest coast of Ireland, and established a golf tournament there in 1984 in her husband's memory. A hurricane in 1989 destroyed her home in St. Croix. While in New York, inquiring about the costs of rebuilding, she suffered six successive <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>and</b> underwent an angioplasty. She moved permanently to Glengariff after suffering a stroke in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of using}} aspirin to prevent {{clotting}} diseases (such as <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>and</b> strokes) was revived in the 1960s, when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that aspirin had an anti-adhesive effect on blood platelets (and unlike other potential antiplatelet drugs, aspirin had low toxicity). Medical Research Council haematologist John O'Brien picked up on Weiss's finding and, in 1963, began working with epidemiologist Peter Elwood on aspirin's anti-thrombosis drug potential. Elwood began a large-scale trial of aspirin as a preventive drug for heart attacks. Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide aspirin tablets, and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a double-blind controlled studyâ€”heart attack survivors were statistically {{more likely to suffer}} a second attack, greatly reducing the number of patients necessary to reliably detect whether aspirin had an effect on heart attacks. The study began in February 1971, though the researchers soon had to break the double-blinding when a study by American epidemiologist Hershel Jick suggested that aspirin prevented heart attacks but suggested that the heart attacks were more deadly. Jick had found that fewer aspirin-takers were admitted to his hospital for heart attacks than non-aspirin-takers, and one possible explanation was that aspirin caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital; Elwood's initial results ruled out that explanation. When the Elwood trial ended in 1973, it showed a modest but not statistically significant reduction in heart attacks among the group taking aspirin.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Heart {{disease and}} stroke {{are the first}} and third leading causes of death of American women, respectively. African American women {{experience}} a disproportionate burden of these diseases compared with Caucasian women and {{are also more likely to}} delay seeking treatment for acute symptoms. As knowledge is a first step in seeking care, this study examined the knowledge of <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> stroke symptoms among African American women. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study analyzing 2003 â€“ 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) data. A composite <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> stroke knowledge score was computed for each respondent from the 13 <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> stroke symptom knowledge questions. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using low scores on the <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> stroke knowledge questions as the dependent variable. Results: Twenty percent of the respondents were low scorers, and 23. 8 % were high scorers. Logistic regression analysis showed that adult African American women who earned low scores on the composite <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> stroke knowledge questions (range 0 â€“ 8 points) were more likely to be aged 18 â€“ 34 (OR = 1. 36, CI 1. 35, 1. 37), be uninsured (OR = 1. 32, CI 1. 31, 1. 33), have an annual household income <$ 35, 000 (OR = 1. 46, CI 1. 45, 1. 47), and have a primary healthcare provider (OR = 1. 22, CI 1. 20, 1. 23). Conclusions: The findings indicated that knowledge of <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> stroke symptoms varied significantly among African American women, depending on socioeconomic variables. Targeting interventions to African American women, particularly those in lower socioeconomic groups, may increase knowledge of <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> stroke symptoms, subsequently improving preventive action taken in response to these conditions...|$|R
