5|$|The town {{came into}} being as a spa in the Restoration and had <b>its</b> <b>heyday</b> as a tourist resort under Beau Nash when the Pantiles and its chalybeate spring {{attracted}} visitors who wished to take the waters. Though its popularity waned {{with the advent of}} sea bathing, the town remains popular and derives some 30 percent of its income from the tourist industry.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1300, the port {{exported}} wheat, peas and beans to Ireland, France and Spain, and by 1400 was also exporting cloth from Somerset and the adjoining counties. By 1500 {{it was the}} largest port in Somerset, later becoming the fifth largest in England, until eclipsed by Bristol in the 18th century. In <b>its</b> <b>heyday,</b> imports included wine, grain, fish, hemp, coal and timber. Exports included wheat, wool, cloth, cement, bricks and tiles. Unlike Bristol, Bridgwater was never involved in the slave trade and, in 1797, was the first town in Britain to petition the government to ban it.|$|E
5|$|In <b>its</b> <b>heyday,</b> el-Mansuriya was {{the capital}} of a state that {{encompassed}} most of North Africa from Morocco to Libya, as well as Sicily, although it had to guard against attack from the Byzantine Empire and from King Otto I of Germany, both active in southern Italy. In 957, an embassy from Byzantium brought the tribute from the Emperor for his occupation of Calabria from there, with gifts of gold and silver vessels adorned with jewels, silks, brocades and other valuables. In Italy, El-Muizz planned the invasion of Egypt, whose conquest would make the Fatimids rivals in power to the Abbasids in Baghdad.|$|E

5|$|Stone is quarried {{in various}} parts of Wales, and slate {{quarrying}} has been a major industry in North Wales. The Cilgwyn Quarry was being worked in the 12th century, but later Blaenau Ffestiniog became the centre of production. The Penrhyn Quarry is still producing slates, though at a reduced capacity compared to <b>its</b> <b>heyday,</b> and the Llechwedd Slate Caverns have been converted into a visitor attraction. Several of the railways that used to carry the slates to the ports have been restored as tourist attractions, including the Ffestiniog Railway and the Talyllyn Railway.|$|E
5|$|The Penrhyn Quarry {{is still}} {{producing}} slate, though {{at a much}} reduced capacity from <b>its</b> <b>heyday</b> {{at the end of}} the 19th century. In 1995, it accounted for almost 50% of UK production. It is currently owned and operated by Welsh Slate Ltd (a subsidiary of Lagan Building Solutions), which also owns and carries out some operations at the Oakeley quarry at Blaenau Ffestiniog, the Pen yr Orsedd quarry in the Nantlle Vale, and the Cwt-y-Bugail quarry. In March 2010 the company announced its decision to mothball the Oakeley quarry because of subsidence at the site.|$|E
5|$|The league {{was formed}} in 1889 as the Birmingham & District League to cater for teams in Birmingham and the {{surrounding}} area, but soon became established {{as one of the}} strongest leagues outside the Football League itself, with teams from as far afield as Bristol and Wales taking part. After the Second World War it absorbed the rival Birmingham Combination to become firmly established as the leading league in the area, but a gradual decline in its status began in the late 1950s and it now operates at a much lower level than in <b>its</b> <b>heyday.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{town has}} {{an example of}} Indo-Saracenic Revival {{architecture}} {{in the form of}} the Surat Bhawan Palace, which was built in 1894 and resembles a French Chateau. It has hosted, in <b>its</b> <b>heydays</b> The Prince of Wales, Senator Teddy Roosevelt, Cricketer Edward Jardine(Body line Fame)among others. Cheti Mela, a fair held in April, is the major fair of the district. Other tourist attractions nearby include Dudhwa National Park, Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary and Frog Temple.|$|R

5|$|The pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} in <b>its</b> <b>heyday</b> was {{the core}} of a very diverse navy. Many older ironclads were still in service. Battleships served alongside cruisers of many descriptions: modern armoured cruisers which were essentially cut-down battleships, lighter protected cruisers, and even older unarmoured cruisers, sloops and frigates whether built out of steel, iron or wood. The battleships were threatened by torpedo boats; it was during the pre-dreadnought era that the first destroyers were constructed to deal with the torpedo-boat threat, though {{at the same time the}} first effective submarines were being constructed.|$|E
5|$|The town {{began as}} a small {{shipping}} community, receiving goods and passengers from London en route to Canterbury and Dover. The town rose to prominence as a seaside resort during the early 19th century after {{the building of a}} pleasure pier and promenade by a group of London investors, and reached <b>its</b> <b>heyday</b> in the late Victorian era. Its popularity as a holiday destination has declined over the past decades, due to the increase in foreign travel and to a lesser degree exposure to flooding that has prevented the town's redevelopment.|$|E
5|$|Between September 2 and September 17, the Breeders {{performed}} in eleven cities, among which were St. Louis, Denver, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. Support groups the Funs and the Neptunas opened {{for them at}} five and six of these shows, respectively. The band then played at the Hollywood Bowl concert, and wrapped up the tour on September 20 at the Goose Island 312 Urban Block Dance Party event in Chicago. In addition to their new songs, they performed numerous selections from Last Splash and Pod (1990). The tour received good reviews from critics; appraisal included comments that the performances were rousing, and that the band was as good as—or better than—in <b>its</b> <b>heyday.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1812 Samual Clark and James Mart {{constructed}} {{a machine that}} was capable of working a pattern and net at the same time. A pusher operated each bobbin and carriage independently allowing almost unlimited designs and styles. The machine however was slow, delicate, costly and could produce only short [...] "webs" [...] of about two by four yards. The machine was modified by J. Synyer in 1829. and by others before. Production had <b>its</b> <b>heydays</b> in the 1860s and ceased around 1870-1880.|$|R

5|$|Bottling and {{shipping}} of the Malvern water grew in volume. In 1842, Dr. James Wilson and Dr. James Manby Gully, leading exponents of hydrotherapy, set up clinics in Malvern (Holyrood House {{for women and}} Tudor House for men). Malvern expanded rapidly as a residential spa. Several large hotels {{and many of the}} large villas in Malvern date from <b>its</b> <b>heyday.</b> Many smaller hotels and guest houses were built between about 1842 and 1875. By 1855 there were already 95hotels and boarding houses and by 1865 over a quarter of the town's 800houses were boarding and lodging houses. Most were in Great Malvern, the town centre, while others were in the surrounding settlements of Malvern Wells, Malvern Link, North Malvern and West Malvern.|$|E
5|$|From <b>its</b> <b>heyday</b> of the 1850s {{until the}} Great Depression in the 1930s, Jeffersonville {{was the leading}} center of U.S. {{steamboat}} production, due largely to its excellent harbor, which remained the deepest in the surrounding area. Many individuals {{who lived in the}} district worked at the Howard Shipyards, that became Jeffboat in the nearby town of Port Fulton, which was eventually annexed into Jeffersonville. The town gained its first railroad in 1852, connecting to Columbus, Indiana, and {{with the opening of the}} Fourteenth Street Bridge in 1870, became a railroad center. The city became an important distribution center during the Civil War for the Union Army, because three railroads connected to Jeffersonville and because the Ohio River served as a defensive barrier against invasion from Confederate attack, it was deemed a safer location than the more vulnerable city of Louisville, Kentucky located on the southern side of the river.|$|E
5|$|Isambard Kingdom Brunel and {{his family}} lived in Weston, at Swiss Villa (towards {{the north end of}} Trevelyan road), while he was supervising the {{construction}} of the Bristol and Exeter Railway in the area. With the opening of the railway in 1841, thousands of visitors came to the town from Bristol, the Midlands and further afield, on works outings and bank holidays. Mining families also came across the Bristol Channel from South Wales by paddle steamer. To cater for them, Birnbeck Pier was completed in 1867, offering in <b>its</b> <b>heyday</b> amusement arcades, tea rooms, amusement rides and a photographic studio. It is now in a derelict state and has been added to English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register, but visitors can still admire its structure from behind barbed wire. It was designed by Eugenius Birch with ironwork by the Isca Foundry of Newport, Monmouthshire. It is a grade II* listed building.|$|E
5000|$|Ons Volkske {{published}} mostly Belgian and Dutch comics artists, {{the most}} notable being Marc Sleen (Piet Fluwijn en Bolleke), Willy Vandersteen (De Vrolijke Bengels), Bob de Moor, Piet van Elk, Henk Albers, Albert van Beek, Gommaar Timmermans, Hurey, Gilbert Declercq, Gert Ronde, Karel Verschuere, Jacques Van Melkebeke, Jo-El Azara, Tibet, and reprints of series that were published in Tintin before. Due to its low price and cheaper print paper [...] "Ons Volkske" [...] gained the nickname [...] "the poor man's version of Tintin", but despite that it was still the trend-setting comic book magazine in Flanders and sold very well during <b>its</b> <b>heydays.</b>|$|R

5|$|Nigeria Airways had <b>its</b> <b>heyday</b> in {{the early}} 1980s, just before the {{departure}} of a KLM team that had been hired to make the airline efficient and profitable. At that time, its fleet consisted of about 30 aircraft, but the carrier was two years behind with its accounts {{to the extent that}} aircraft were acquired for cash. Owned or leased, the carrier operated a variety of aircraft during its history, including the Airbus A310, the Boeing 737, and the Douglas DC-10, of which it flew the last one ever built. Plagued by mis-management, corruption, and overstaffing, at the time of closure the airline had debts totalling , a poor safety record, and its operative fleet comprised a single aircraft flying domestic routes as well as two leased aircraft operating the international network. Nigeria Airways was succeeded by Virgin Nigeria, and the ground facilities were taken over by Arik Air.|$|E
5|$|Situated in the Burnden area of Bolton, {{approximately}} one {{mile from the}} centre of the town, the ground served as the home of the town's football team for 102 years. In <b>its</b> <b>heyday,</b> Burnden Park could hold up to 70,000 supporters but this figure was dramatically reduced during the final 20 years of its life. A section of The Embankment was sold off in 1986 {{to make way for a}} new Normid superstore. At this time, Bolton were in a dire position financially and were struggling in the Football League Third Division, so there was a low demand for tickets and the loss of part of the ground gave the Bolton directors good value for money.|$|E
5|$|The Industrial Revolution {{changed much}} of Europe’s silk industry. Due to {{innovations}} on spinning cotton, cotton became much cheaper to manufacture and therefore caused more expensive silk production to become less mainstream. New weaving technologies, however, increased {{the efficiency of}} production. Among these was the Jacquard loom, developed for silk embroidery. An epidemic of several silkworm diseases caused production to fall, especially in France, where the industry never recovered. In the 20th century Japan and China regained their earlier role in silk production, and China is now once again the world’s largest producer of silk. The rise of new fabrics such as nylon reduced the prevalence of silk throughout the world, and silk is now once again a rare luxury good, much less important than in <b>its</b> <b>heyday.</b>|$|E

5|$|Gyeongju has {{produced}} notable individuals throughout its history. As {{the capital of}} Silla, Gyeongju was a center of culture in <b>its</b> <b>heyday.</b> Notable Gyeongju residents in the Silla period included most of the kingdom's leading figures, not only rulers but scholars such as Seol Chong and Choe Chi-won, and generals like Kim Yusin, {{the leader of the}} Hwarang warriors. The city continued to contribute to traditional Korean thought in subsequent dynasties. Relatives of Choe Chi-won such as Choe Eon-wui and Choe Hang {{played an important role in}} establishing the structures of early Goryeo. In the Joseon period, Gyeongju joined the rest of Gyeongsang in becoming a hotbed of the conservative Sarim faction. Notable Gyeongju members of this faction included the 15th century intellectual Yi Eon-jeok. He has been enshrined in the Oksan Seowon since 1572. In modern times, the city produced writers such as Kim Dong-ni and Park Mok-wol, both of whom did a great deal to popularize the region's culture, as well as Choe Jun, a wealthy businessman who established the Yeungnam University Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Kelston Lock and weir have {{permanent}} moorings {{above and}} below them. The Riverside Inn and Saltford Marina are also close by. Saltford Lock and weir are overlooked by {{the remains of the}} Kelston Brass Mill, which was working until 1925. It is a grade II listed building. Alongside the lock is a pub, whose garden extends over the lock to the small island between the lock and weir. The lock was opened in 1727 and destroyed in 1738 by rival coal dealers to stop the use of the river for transportation. In <b>its</b> <b>heyday,</b> between 1709 and 1859 Swineford had an active brass and copper industry around the Swineford Lock which were served by the river which also provided water power for the cloth industry, as did the River Boyd, a tributary which flows into the Avon near Bitton. Keynsham Lock opened in 1727. Just above the lock are some visitor moorings and a pub, on an island between the lock and the weir. The weir side of the island is also the mouth of the River Chew. Hanham is the last tidal lock, after which the river is joined by Brislington Brook.|$|E
5|$|The {{research}} findings of historian Carroll Quigley, {{author of the}} 1966 book Tragedy and Hope, are taken by both conspiracy theorists of the American Old Right (W. Cleon Skousen) and New Left (Carl Oglesby) to substantiate this view, even though Quigley argued that the Establishment {{is not involved in}} a plot to implement a one-world government but rather British and American benevolent imperialism driven by the mutual interests of economic elites in the United Kingdom and the United States. Quigley also argued that, although the Round Table still exists today, its position in influencing the policies of world leaders has been much reduced from <b>its</b> <b>heyday</b> during World War I and slowly waned after the end of World War II and the Suez Crisis. Today the Round Table is largely a ginger group, designed to consider and gradually influence the policies of the Commonwealth of Nations, but faces strong opposition. Furthermore, in American society after 1965, the problem, according to Quigley, was that no elite was in charge and acting responsibly.|$|E
