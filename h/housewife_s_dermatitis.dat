The problem addressed in this paper was to describe how the role of the housewife in helping the family economy In Garuda Permai Housing Phase 1 Tampan District of Pekanbaru City. The role of housewife was seen from indicators such as : how the respondents profile work, how respondent worked to help the family economy and how the role of the respondents worked in performing the function of the family. Respondents were housewives who work; the sample used the census technique which collected data as a whole by means of direct interviews using questionnaires. The method used descriptive quantitative methods of data analysis and descriptive explanation. Screening instrument data used were observation, questionnaires and interviews as well as tables of data contained in the table.

40|$|Although innate {{lymphoid cells}} (ILCs) have {{recently}} been identified also in skin, their role in this organ remains poorly understood. In this study, we aimed at developing a technique to assess ILCs in situ and to determine their topographical distribution in human skin. We collected lesional skin biopsies from patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (both n = 13) and normal human skin from healthy controls. After establishing immunofluorescence ILC in situ stainings, we developed an analysis approach (gating combined with manual validation) to reliably identify ILCs. Topographical mapping was obtained by automated calculations of the distances between ILCs and different cellular/structural elements of the skin. Whereas normal human skin harbored a very scarce ILC population (mostly ILC 1 s and AHR+ILC 3 <b>s),</b> atopic <b>dermatitis</b> and psoriasis skin was infiltrated by clearly visible ILC subsets. We observed atopic dermatitis skin to contain not only ILC 2 s but also a prominent AHR+ILC 3 population. Conversely, we encountered almost equal proportions of ILC 1 s and RORC+ILC 3 s in psoriasis skin. Distance calculations revealed ILCs to reside near the epidermis and {{in close proximity to}} T lymphocytes. ILC mapping in situ will provide valuable information about their likely communication partners in normal and diseased skin and forms the basis for the appropriate mechanistic studies...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the high}} {{prevalence}} of cutaneous infections, {{little is known}} about the role of host immune respon-siveness during Staphylococcus aureus dermatitis. We have recently described a murine model of infectious dermatitis induced by superantigen-producing S. aureus. To assess the role of neutrophils in staphylococcal dermatitis, mice were given granulocyte-depleting monoclonal antibody prior to and on several occasions following intracutaneous inoculation with staphylococci. The granulocyte-depleted mice that had been intra-dermally inoculated with S. aureus developed crusted ulcerations which tended not to heal, whereas animals injected with control monoclonal antibody displayed only minor and transient skin lesions. The finding of severe ulcerations in neutropenic mice correlated with a significantly higher burden of bacteria in the blood and skin during the early phase of the infection. Importantly, while mice with an intact granulocyte population showed only limited skin infection, bacteremia occurred in the great majority of the neutrophil-depleted animals. As a consequence, the latter individuals exhibited significantly increased levels of the proinflamma-tory cytokine interleukin- 6 and specific antibodies to staphylococcal cell wall components and toxic shock syndrome toxin- 1 in the serum.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the lived experiences of <b>housewives</b> in 1950 <b>s</b> and early 1960 s Britain and their portrayal in The Feminine Mystique and popular women’s magazines. Through a study of four housewives’ associations, the Women’s Institutes, Mothers’ Union, Townswomen’s Guilds and the National Council of Women, it is argued that they rejected the prevailing ideology of domesticity and challenged the myth of the ‘happy housewife’. As a result housewives’ associations presented a modern interpretation of domesticity where wives and mothers not only cared for their husbands and children but also made an important contribution to wider society. As equal citizens women were entitled to state support and housewives’ associations were successful in articulating the demands of women as wives, mothers and paid employees. In doing so housewives’ associations presented a much more nuanced account of women’s everyday lives illustrating that not all women succumbed to the feminine mystique...|$|R

Visible skin inflammation, characterized by redness and swelling, was noted 48 [*]h after inoculation of staphylococci in mice that received 2 [*]×[*] 108 colony-forming units of S. [*]aureus. Microscopic evaluation revealed a dermal and subcutaneous infiltrate rich in macrophages and neutrophilic granulocytes already within 6 [*]h after inoculation. A sparse influx of T lymphocytes was noted somewhat later. Bacterial cultures from skin revealed high numbers of staphylococci early after inoculation, with a successive decline during 2 [*]wk follow-up. Total white blood cell count as well as the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes peaked 2 [*]d after bacterial inoculation. Also, serum interleukin- 6 levels peaked within 2 [*]d, with a 10 -fold increase compared to non-infected control mice, indicating a systemic reaction to skin infection. The role of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 in the pathogenesis of the dermatitis was assessed using isogenic S. [*]aureus strains. Even though the gross inflammatory skin reaction was similar for mice infected with either of the strains, it was apparent that bacteria secreting toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 preferentially triggered influx of T lymphocytes to the skin.

40|$|A {{reduction}} in the in vitro production of IFN-γ has been consistently described in atopic dermatitis (AD). Whether this reduction {{is due to a}} decrease in the population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) producing IFN-γ or reduced IFN-γ production per cell, or a combination of both is not clear. We have examined the intracellular production of IFN-γ in children with AD and in healthy non-atopic controls. As Staphylococcus aureus colonization is a feature of childhood AD, and is postulated to contribute to the cutaneous inflammation in atopic <b>dermatitis,</b> <b>S.</b> aureus and Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) were used to activate PBMC. Stimulated PBMC from subjects with AD had significantly fewer IFN-γ-containing cells in response to SEB (P < 0. 001) and S. aureus (P < 0. 01) than normal non-atopic children. In addition, SEB-stimulated PBMC from children with AD had less IFN-γ per cell than normal non-atopic children (P < 0. 01). Reduction in the proportion of cells containing IFN-γ was seen in CD 4 +, CD 8 + and natural killer (NK) cells in PBMC from children with AD. Our findings indicate that reduced production of IFN-γ observed in childhood AD is due to both a {{decrease in the number of}} IFN-γ-producing cells and a reduced amount of IFN-γ production per cell. Furthermore, we found that this defect was not confined to CD 4 + T cells, suggesting a more generalized defect in IFN-γ production in childhood AD...|$|R

The Hours is a 2002 British-American drama film directed by Stephen Daldry, and starring Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Ed Harris. The screenplay by David Hare is based on Michael Cunningham's 1999 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same title. The plot focuses on three women of different generations whose lives are interconnected by the novel Mrs Dalloway by Virginia Woolf. These are Clarissa Vaughan (Streep), a New Yorker preparing an award party for her AIDS-stricken long-time friend and poet, Richard (Harris) in 2001; Laura Brown (Moore), a pregnant 1950 <b>s</b> California <b>housewife</b> with a young boy and an unhappy marriage; and Virginia Woolf (Kidman) herself in 1920 s England, who is struggling with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel.

I will furthermore explore the late theatre activist Augusto Boal’s notion of the stage as rehearsal site in the light of constructing new forms of queer identity. Boal demonstrated that audience intervention on stage can construct new ways of acting in the everyday. Using this as a model, performing self and its double opens up the possibility for imagined in-between and non-static spaces where queer identities unfold in relation to the duet (live and the double) on stage and can be assembled and cast off at will. I am a live artist. I establish the double in Spank performed at National Review of Live Art 2008 {{in the form of a}} recorded newsreader, or as high femme alter ego, Mertle, in the participatory art project Eating Secret (Tate Modern 2009 : international feminist art and the archive show Once More With Feeling).

40|$|Mum’s lit is {{a popular}} {{literary}} form aimed primarily at middle-class mothers in the 30 - 40 age-bracket. It is marketed as both an offshoot and sequel to mainstream single-girl orientated ‘chick-lit’ and resembles the latter in its use of pastel dustjackets and {{the implementation of a}} chatty and informal first person narrative style. However, as my paper will argue, while mainstream ‘chick-lit’ blended conventional notions of female desire and behaviour with the new educational and employment aspirations of young women, ‘mum’s lit both reflects and reinforces the much more restrictive code of female behaviour expected of mothers of young children in the contemporary socio-political climate of the US and UK. Mum’s lit writers – such as Alison Pearson (I Don’t Know How She Does it) India Knight (My Life on A Plate) Lucy Cavendish (Samantha Smythe’s Modern Home Journal) and Fiona Gibson (Mummy Said the F-word) are journalists who had already established a niche as opinion makers and authorities on domestically life prior to publishing their first ‘mum’s’ lit novel. Through the voice of the heroine-mother (a character who’s lifestyle, attitudes and even appearance, bear an uncanny resemblance to the public mother/opinion maker author) such novels endorse what feminist critics have described as the ‘new mommist’ ideology of 24 hour attachment and intensive parenting. Although ‘mum’s lit’ is promoted as supportive to mothers by critiquing the culture of maternal perfectionism, it clearly perpetuates binary notions of good and bad motherhood but supplants an older, now outdated mode of domestic perfectionism and rigid child management regimes (associated with the Bowlby’s ‘refrigerator’ mother – the frosty 1950 <b>s</b> <b>housewife)</b> with a new ideology that forgives a small amount of domestic tardiness if this occurs in the service of creating a child-centred culture of continually fun and creativity which is accompanied by dizzying levels of emotional engagement and empathy. The paper will argue that the ‘new mommist’/intensive parenting orthodoxy portrayed in these novels is thus as demanding as the post-war domestic ideology and is equally invested in biologically essentialist attitudes towards parenting and motherhood...|$|R

The aim of this exploratory {{study was to investigate}} the effect of a cosmetic lotion containing heat-treated Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533 (HT La 1) on S. aureus colonization in AD patients. Methods: This open-label, multicenter study was performed in AD patients in Germany. First, detection of S. aureus was performed in all patients using the swab or scrub-wash method of sampling, followed by quantitative culture or quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Repeatability and reproducibility of all method combinations were evaluated to select the best combination of sampling and quantification. Second, a lotion containing HT La 1 was applied to lesional skin twice daily for 3 weeks. Scoring using local objective SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), measurement of S. aureus load, and lesional microbiome analysis were performed before and after the 3 -week treatment period. Results: Thirty-one patients with AD were included in the study. All sampling and quantification methods were found to be robust, reproducible, and repeatable for assessing S. aureus load. For simplicity, a combination of swab and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was chosen to assess the efficacy of HT La 1. Following application of a lotion containing HT La 1 to AD lesions for 3 weeks, a reduction in S. aureus load was observed in patients, which correlated with a decrease in local objective SCORAD. Interestingly, high baseline skin concentrations of S. aureus were associated with good responses to the lotion. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the application of a lotion containing HT La 1 to the lesional skin of patients with AD for 3 weeks controlled S. aureus colonization and was associated with local clinical improvement (SCORAD). These findings support further development of topical treatments containing heat-treated nonreplicating beneficial bacteria for patients with AD.

Langerhansove stanice (LS) dendritičke su stanice podrijetlom iz koštane srži. U koži se najčešće nalaze unutar spinoznog sloja i broje 2 - 4 % svih epidermalnih stanica. LS su epidermalne stanice koje prezentiraju antigen i imaju važnu ulogu u kontaktnoj alergijskoj reakciji u virusnih bolesti, Graft-versus-host bolesti i odstranjenju neoplastičkih staničnih klonova.

This paper {{describes}} our own {{findings on}} the role of Langerhans’ cells in dermatology and discusses literature data on their detection in seven different dermatoses. The skin {{is an integral part of}} immune system. During the past 30 years, increasing evidence has been accumulated that the skin contains cellular elements which are needed for the initiation and expression of immune response. Langerhans’ cells (LCs) are dendritic cells originating in the bone marrow. They reside mainly within stratified squamous epithelia and constitute approximately 2 - 4 % of epithelial cells. LCs are epidermal antigen presenting cells which play a crucial role in allergic contact hypersensitivity, viral diseases, graft versus host disease and elimination of neo-plastic cell clones. They express antigens conjugated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II positive molecules on their surfaces for presentation to T-helper lymphocytes. LCs cannot be identified in routinely prepared histologic testing but can be visualised at the light microscope level by histochemical and immunologic techniques. Appropriate methods for the detection of Langerhans’ cells in dermatology (also shown by our own experience) are histoenzymatic methods of adenosintriphosphatase (ATP-ase), acid phosphatase (AP), alpha-naphthylacetatesterase (ANAE and peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunohistochemistry method with polyclonal S- 100 protein antibody (PAP). LCs are the only cells in normal skin with ATP-ase activity. Histoenzymatic methods used in patients with atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, mycosis fungoides, Behcet’s disease, lichen ruber planus, psoriasis vulgaris, irritant dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis demonstrated LSs in epidermis and dermis. ANAE and AP showed concordance and were suitable histochemical markers for LC distribution and macrophages in the dermis in mycosis fungoides, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis vulgaris, irritant chronic dermatitis and Bechet’s disease. Our experience of the human skin showed a strong activity of calcium-activated adenosine triphosphatase in LCs. LCs in the guinea pig skin can be demonstrated by Mg++ and Ca++ activated adenosine triphosphatase, but a stronger activity of Ca++ activated adenosine triphosphatase in LCs after irritation. Ca++ ATP-ase as an indicator of energy-dependent pump is the reflection of intracellular calcium level, which is a significant factor for regulating the growth and metabolism of the cells. LCs are found as target cells during the efferent phase of contact allergic reaction. Immunohistochemical methods, define the role of LCs in dermatology more precisely and allow complete immunologic recognition within the epidermis...|$|R
