40|$|International audienceThe {{impact of}} {{small-scale}} topography on the ocean's dynamical balance is investigated by quantifying the rates at which <b>internal</b> wave <b>drag</b> extracts (angular) momentum and vorticity {{from the general}} circulation. The calculation exploits the recent advent of two near-global descriptions of topographic roughness on horizontal scales {{on the order of}} 1 - 10 km, which {{play a central role in}} the generation of internal lee waves by geostrophic flows impinging on topography and have been hitherto unresolved by bathymetric datasets and ocean general circulation models alike. It is found that, while <b>internal</b> wave <b>drag</b> is a minor contributor to the ocean's dynamical balance over much of the globe, it is a significant player in the dynamics of extensive areas of the ocean, most notably the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and several regions of enhanced small-scale topographic variance in the equatorial and Southern Hemisphere oceans. There, the contribution of <b>internal</b> wave <b>drag</b> to the ocean's (angular) momentum and vorticity balances is generally on the order of ten to a few tens of percent of the dominant source and sink terms in each dynamical budget, which are respectively associated with wind forcing and form drag by topography with horizontal scales from 500 to 1000 km. It is thus suggested that the representation of <b>internal</b> wave <b>drag</b> in general circulation models may lead to significant changes in the deep ocean circulation of those regions. A theoretical scaling is derived that captures the basic dependence of <b>internal</b> wave <b>drag</b> on topographic roughness and near-bottom flow speed for most oceanographically relevant regimes...|$|R

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} large-eddy simulation (LES) {{model was}} used to examine how stratified flow interacts with bottom obstacles in the coastal ocean. Bottom terrain representing a 2 D ridge was modeled using a finite-volume approach with ridge height (4. 5 m) and width (; 30 m) and water depth (; 45 m) appropriate for coastal regions. Temperature and salinity profiles representative of coastal conditions giving constant buoyancy frequency were applied with flow velocities between 0. 16 and 0. 4 m s 21. Simulations using a free-slip lower boundary yielded flow responses ranging from transition flows with relatively high <b>internal</b> wave pressure <b>drag</b> to super-critical flow with relatively small <b>internal</b> wave <b>drag.</b> Cases with high wave drag exhibited strong lee-wave systems with wavelength of; 100 m and regions of turbulent overturning. Application of bottom drag caused a 5 – 10 -m-thick bottom boundary layer to form, which greatly reduced the strength of lee-wave systems in the transition cases. A final simulation with bottom drag, but with a much larger obstacle height (16 m) and width (; 400 m), produced a stronger lee-wave response, indicating that large obstacle flow is not influenced as much by bottom roughness. Flow characteristics for the larger obstacle were more similar to hydraulic flow, with lee waves that are relatively short in comparison with the obstacle width. The relatively strong effect of bottom roughness on the small obstacle wave drag suggests that small-scale bottom variations may be ignored in <b>internal</b> wave <b>drag</b> parameterizations. However, the more significant wave drag from larger-scale obstacles must still be considered and may be responsible for mixing and momentum transfer at distances far from the obstacle source. 1...|$|R

The principle of the device is based on accelerating a large mass of water by expansion of a small mass of gas, the gas being injected continuously into the water. The investigation consisted of tests conducted on ducts of several different designs; varying the exit area of the duets, the water and gas flow, and the method of injecting and mixing the gas and water. Using hydrogen gas at a rate of 0. 0165 lbs/sec at a water flow rate of 27. 4 lbs/sec, a maximum gross thrust of 29. 2 lbs was obtained. At this water flow rate the <b>internal</b> friction <b>drag</b> of the duct was 20. 5 lbs, giving a net thrust of 8. 7 lbs. The effective exhaust velocity for these flow rates was 56, 900 ft/sec [...] ThAt is equivalent to a specific impulse of 1, 770 sec., whereas a good conventional rocket fuel would have a specific impulse of about 250 sec. At low gas flow rates an effective exhaust velocity of 296, 000 ft/sec. was obtained. However, at this low gas rate the gross thrust was less than the <b>internal</b> friction <b>drag</b> of the duct.

40|$|KNOWLEDGE of intake drag is {{important}} in estimating {{the performance of the}} aerospace vehicle. The contribution to the intake drag is mainly due to the external and internal flow through the intake and termed as external and <b>internal</b> <b>drag.</b> External drag is mainly composed of drag due to cowl, diverter, and spillage of flow (pre-entry drag), while the <b>internal</b> <b>drag</b> is due to the wall skin friction and pressure distribution {{on the walls of the}} duct. Various components of the drag associated with a typical intake of an air-breathing vehicle are shown in Fig. 1. It is possible to estimate the <b>internal</b> <b>drag</b> in the absence of any flow separation while the estimation of external drag is difficult particularly when the intake is operating in subcritical condition. At this operating condition of intake, experimental method is the only source to determine the intake drag. Hitherto, drag due to intake alone is measured having the intake specially mounted to the forebody of the fuselage and front portion of intake forming a metric part with a balance. Available test techniques demand a special balance and suitable modifications to the intake module [1]. This is cumbersome and involves more time and additional cost towards design, fabrication and calibration of new balance. As an alternative, a test technique developed and patented for the direct measurement of after body drag in the base flow wind tunnel [2 – 4] is used to demonstrate the usefulness of this technique for the measurement of intake drag in a limited Mach number range.

40|$|Abstract. The {{traditional}} {{model of}} tidal dissipation {{is based on}} a frictional bottom boundary layer, in which the work done by bottom drag is proportional to a drag coe-cient and the velocity cubed. However, away from shallow, coastal regions the tidal velocities are small, and the work done by the bottom boundary layer can account for only weak levels of dissipation. In the deep ocean, the energy flux carried by internal waves generated over rough topog-raphy dominates the energy transfer away from barotropic flow. A parameterization for the <b>internal</b> wave <b>drag</b> over rough topography is included as a dissipative mechanism in a model for the barotropic tides. Model results suggest that the inclusion of this dissipation mechanism improves hydro-dynamical models of the ocean tide. It also substantially in-creases the amount of modeled tidal dissipation in the deep ocean, bringing dissipation levels there into agreement with recent estimates from TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry data...|$|R
