Two weeks after {{returning}} to Canada, he accepted an invitation from the International Wrestling Association of Japan (IWA Japan). While in Japan, he achieved his dream of wrestling in Tokyo's Korakuen Hall. Three months later, World Championship Wrestling was taping WCW Thunder in Kelowna, British Columbia and recruited Juggernaut and three other local wrestlers for a match. They faced KroniK in a handicap match with a two-minute time limit.

Mikaela Shiffrin was the gold medallist in an overall time of one minute and 44.54 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Rossi held a one-second {{lead over}} Vandoorne who pushed {{hard to keep}} him within {{distance}} of Rossi. Evans attempted to overtake Yelloly leaving the tunnel at the chicane but Yellowly steered into Evans, who was forced to retire from the event on lap 18. The incident necessitated the activation of the virtual safety car (VSC) to allow track officials to clean the circuit. Rossi and Vandoorne elected to make pit stops for super soft tyres during the VSC with Vandoorne emerging in the lead. Leal moved into third despite making contact with Sirotkin. At the race's restart, Vandoorne extended his advantage over Rossi by 3.4 seconds {{in the course of}} one lap. This was the case until Rossi drove two seconds faster on the following lap and was half a second behind Vandoorne by the 23rd lap. Yelloly set the feature race's fastest time on the same lap, completing a circuit <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> and 22.314 seconds. Vandoorne's and Rossi's releases from their pit stall were investigated by the stewards but chose not to take any further action. A brief second VSC period was deployed when debris was located in the run up to Rascasse corner. Canamasas overtook Pic at Sainte Dévote to move into fourth {{at the beginning of the}} 28th lap.|$|E

25|$|Two of the {{earliest}} such units of measure to come into use were the horsepower and the degree Fahrenheit.

In 1777 the Royal Society, under the chairmanship of Henry Cavendish, proposed {{the definition of the}} Fahrenheit scale be modified such that the temperature corresponding to the melting point of ice be 32°F and the boiling point of water under standard atmospheric conditions be 212°F.|$|E

25|$|Akebono had his MMA {{debut in}} K-1 before Ultimate Fighting Championship pioneer Royce Gracie. Although he was {{initially}} {{able to pass}} Gracie's guard briefly and fend him off, he was eventually submitted with an omoplata/wrist-lock combination. Akebono returned to the event the next year, fighting Bobby Ologun. The sumo champion neutralized Ologun's striking by taking him down and smothering during the earlier rounds, but he was stunned by a barrage of punches and controlled {{for the rest of}} the match, losing the decision. His third match would be against UFC champion Don Frye, who ended the match with a guillotine choke after controlling the fight on the feet.

25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{concentrated}} rainfall {{in the history of}} the United States has occurred in the San Gabriel Mountains north of Los Angeles and Orange Counties.

In February 1978, almost a foot of rain fell in 24 hours, and, in one blast, an inch and a half in five minutes. This storm caused massive debris flows throughout the region, one of them unearthing the corpses in the Verdugo Hills Cemetery and depositing them in the town below.

25|$|Di Grassi forced Engel into {{committing}} {{an error}} and passed {{him to take}} over sixth place. Vergne had now drawn close to race leader Rosenqvist and took advantage of Rosenqvist lifting and coasting. This hindrance allowed Vergne to overtake Rosenqvist easily for first place heading towards turn three on the 29th lap. Vergne's higher top speed enabled him to pull away quickly from Rosenqvist. Prost entered the pit lane because his car had a problem. However, he recorded the race's fastest lap beforehand, completing a circuit <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> and 23.444 seconds on the previous lap. This earned Prost one point. Bird lost third place to teammate López after a closely contested battle which saw both drivers make contact. Both Audi Sport ABT drivers continued and drew closer to Heidfeld. With two laps remaining in the event, Frijns attempted to pass Duval but both drivers made contact and Duval ended his race in the barrier. Yellow flags were waved in the area but the safety car was not deployed. López caught Rosenqvist in the race's final laps but could not pass him.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet 23rd Army {{joined the}} {{offensive}} {{by attempting to}} break through the Finnish lines between Tali and Vuoksi towards Noskua but the repeated Soviet attacks were halted by the highly efficient Finnish artillery. In the end the battle of Tali-Ihantala was a defensive strategic victory for the Finnish army. It blocked the possibility for the Soviet army to break through to the Finnish heartland and the road to Helsinki. Soviet military losses peaked at 28 June when Leningrad Front reported to have lost during that single day over 5 000 soldiers including 1 800 killed in action, over 25% more than in 14 June when they reported to have lost almost 4 000 (including little bit less than 700 killed in action). Especially Finnish artillery concentrated deadly firepower with even 250 artillery pieces sending 2,000 shells to one small target size of just 6 hectares <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>minute.</b> Red Army units saw no chances to penetrate through this fire power. The terrain favored the defenders forcing Soviet armor units to narrow death traps.Finnish radio inquiries captured lots of vital important plans of Red Army giving data for joint-fire artillery- air power counterattacks.|$|E
