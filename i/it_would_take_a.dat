5|$|After {{the rest}} day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 runs with six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 117 runs. Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 after an 87-run {{partnership}} with Miller, bringing Lindwall to the crease. Miller's innings was {{noted for its}} driving {{and when he was}} out for 74, followed by Lindwall for 25, Bradman declared with Australia at 460/7, 595 runs ahead. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> world record chase from England to win the match. Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers, with two each.|$|E
5|$|After work began, it was {{determined}} that the repairs needed were more extensive, costly, and time-consuming than expected, and NJDOT estimated that rehabilitation could cost more than $1.2billion. In 2009, NJDOT estimated that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> decade before the state could afford to rehabilitate or replace the structure. In a controversial move in 2011, Governor Chris Christie directed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) to divert money originally earmarked for the Access to the Region's Core rail project to highway projects. The agency agreed to pay $1.8billion to partially fund efforts to rehabilitate the skyway and Route139, replace Wittpenn Bridge, and extend US1/9 Truck, all part of the larger distribution network in the Port of New York and New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Favre {{was drafted}} by the Atlanta Falcons {{in the second round}} with the 33rd overall pick in the 1991 NFL Draft. On July 19, 1991, Favre agreed to a three-year, US$1.4million {{contract}} with a reported signing bonus of $350,000. Atlanta head coach Jerry Glanville did not approve of the drafting of Favre, saying <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> plane crash for him to put Favre into the game. Favre's first pass in an NFL regular season game resulted in an interception returned for a touchdown in a game against the Washington Redskins. He only attempted four passes in his career at Atlanta, was intercepted twice, and completed none of them. Favre took one other snap, which resulted in a sack for an eleven-yard loss.|$|E

5|$|In South Korea, {{damage was}} {{heaviest}} in South Gyeongsang Province, where 71people were killed. Damage was particularly heavy in Busan, {{as well in}} as Yecheon, Ulsan, and Daegu. In Busan, strong winds wrecked 11lifting cranes, each weighing about 900tons, which injured five people and killed two in one incident. Many shipyards in the region were closed, and initial reports estimated <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> year to fully reopen the Busan port. The estimated damage to the Busan port was about $50million (USD), causing cargo capacity to be cut by 20%. High waves turned a large ship on its side in Busan, and in Ulsan the waves knocked an offshore shipbuilding plant into a petroleum facility, damaging them both. Sixteen {{people were killed in}} Busan.|$|E
5|$|While {{living in}} exile in Switzerland, after being forced to flee Nazi-occupied Austria, Salten wrote a sequel to Bambi that follows the birth and lives of Bambi's twin offspring, Geno and Gurri. The young fawns {{interact}} with various deer, and are educated and watched over by Bambi and Faline as they grow. They also {{learn more about the}} ways of man, including both hunters and the gamekeeper seeking to protect the deer. Due to Salten's exiled status — he had lost his Austrian publisher Paul Zsolnay Verlag — the English translation of the novel was published first, in the United States in 1939 by Bobbs-Merrill, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> year before the sequel was published in the original German language in Switzerland by his new publisher.|$|E
5|$|After the {{resumption}} of play, Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 without adding to his lunch score, ending an 87-run partnership with Miller, and bringing Lindwall to the crease at 416/5. Miller and Lindwall attacked at every opportunity before the declaration. Miller's innings was noted for its driving, and he was out for 74, playing a hook shot that was caught by Bedser at square leg from Laker in pursuit of quick runs. He was followed by Lindwall, who ran out of his crease in attempt to hit Laker across the line to the boundary, missed, and was stumped for 25, prompting Bradman to declare with Australia at 460/7 with a lead of 595 runs. The tourists had added 51 runs {{for the loss of}} three wickets in approximately an hour's batting after lunch. Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers, with two each. The Australians had punished the spinners the most, taking more than 3.50 runs per over from each of Wright, Laker and Compton. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> world record chase from England to win the match.|$|E

5|$|Desperate, they free Chris, who {{reveals that}} Claire is his sister, and the prison has an armored car {{they can use}} to escape. However, a giant axe-wielding monster begins {{breaking}} down the gate. Alice, Chris and Crystal go to the basement armory to get more guns; however, zombies kill Crystal en route. Luther and Claire reinforce the gate. Angel informs Bennett and Yong the car is missing its engine, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> week to fix. Bennett shoots Angel and heads for Arcadia in Alice's airplane. The Axeman breaks down the gate, allowing the zombies into the prison. The group decides to use the zombie-dug tunnels to escape into the sewers. Kim Yong is slashed in half by the Axeman, while Alice is knocked out. Claire successfully defends Alice, manages to defeat the Axeman and disorienting it, after which Alice kills it by firing at its head. Unfortunately, Luther is dragged back into the tunnels by a zombie.|$|E
5|$|Five days of filming {{were spent}} at the London Underground tunnels. Filming took place on actual tube tunnels, albeit disused ones. As the crew were {{scouting}} the disused Aldwych tunnels, they found the ex-Northern line 1972 stock train stabled in the tunnel for maintenance, training, and filming purposes. When Sam Miller called Cross about the development, the writer included it as a last minute addition to the script, and the sequence was shot the next day. As a way to scare the audience, Cross included a homeless woman living in the train. The filming crew present disliked filming the Underground sequences because while filmed during the summer, it became hot locations to work in. The crew were prohibited from bringing food or drink into the tunnels, as it would attract rats. Furthermore, break times had to be longer than usual because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> while for a crew member to leave the tunnels, have a break and then return. The FSB base was filmed in the London Docklands, near the ExCeL London.|$|E
5|$|In December 1986, the Public Roads Administration {{recommended}} a bridge. A report published by SBT in 1987 considered detailed {{plans for a}} subsea tunnel to the mainland, which was followed up by seismic surveys in the fjord. SBT {{changed its name to}} Sunnhordland Bru- og Tunnelselskap, and a majority of the board shifted towards being in favor of a fixed link. The Norwegian Coastal Administration stated that they would not allow a pontoon bridge, as it would interfere with ship traffic. On 26 June 1987, SBT's board decided to work towards getting permission to collect advance tolls on the ferry services. On 16 September, they unanimously supported the triangular proposal, which was estimated to cost NOK660 million. This was criticized by Hordaland Public Roads Administration, who stated that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> longer time to plan, and thus complete, the Triangle Link.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{passed his}} century and began {{accelerating}} before finally falling for 141, leaving Australia at 2/296 in 277 minutes, after a 174-run partnership with Bradman. Hassett was bowled first ball off the inside edge, but Miller survived a loud lbw appeal on Yardley's hat-trick ball. Bradman was on 89 and heading towards a century {{in his last}} Test innings at Lord's when he fell to Bedser again, this time because of a one-handed diving effort from Edrich. Bradman had been worried by Bedser's angle into his pads and the leg trap, but Bedser then moved the ball the other way towards the slips and caught Bradman's outside edge. It was the fourth time out of four innings in the series that Bedser had dismissed Bradman. This left Australia at 4/329 and the next day, Bradman was expected to declare just before lunch {{so that he could}} attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower at this time deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball; Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times. The Australian captain declared on the following day of play at 7/460, 595 runs ahead. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> world record chase from England to win the match. England lost wickets regularly and fell for 186 to lose by 409 runs.|$|E
5|$|Australia won the toss and batted {{first at}} the home of cricket. Centurion Morris fell at 3/166 and new batsman Miller was trapped lbw for four shortly after. Brown came in at 4/173 and helped Lindsay Hassett rebuild the innings after the two quick wickets. Both men scored slowly, {{averaging}} more than three and half minutes for each run. After putting on a partnership of 43, Hassett was bowled by Yardley, who then trapped Brown for 24 to leave Australia stumbling at 6/225. Brown had hit two consecutive half-volleys off his pads through the leg side for four, and attempted a third boundary in a row to a similar delivery. However, this third delivery came off the pitch more quickly and beat Brown for pace. Australia managed to avoid further collapse a counterattack from the tail saw them to 350 before they bowled England out for 215. The tourists batted much more productively in the second innings in ideal weather on the third day. Brown joined Miller after Bradman fell at 4/329; Australia had lost 3/33 but steadied to reach stumps at 343 without further loss, with Brown on seven. After the rest day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 runs and six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages. Just ten minutes after the start, heavy rain intervened. The weather cleared and Miller and Brown moved to lunch on 63 and 32 respectively, with Australia at 4/409. In 88 minutes of play, Australia had added 117 runs. Brown was caught behind from Alec Coxon after lunch without adding to his score for 32, after an 87-run partnership with Miller, with the score at 5/416. Bradman eventually declared at 7/460, 595 runs ahead. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> world record chase from England to win the match. The home team lost wickets regularly and fell for 186 to lose by 409 runs. Although part of a successful team, Brown was unable to replicate the centuries he made in each of his two previous Tests at Lord’s on the preceding tours, and it was to be the last Test of his career.|$|E
