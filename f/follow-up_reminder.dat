The data was obtained from 15 articles published in business, psychology and sociology journals between 1960 and 1982. A meta-analysis of the data indicated that higher response rates were achieved when preliminary notification was given than when it was not, and a telephone call was a more effective form of preliminary notification than a letter. Higher response rates were achieved when a follow-up letter or postcard was sent as a reminder than when no follow-up was used, and a follow-up letter was more effective than a follow-up postcard.

40|$|Class of 2006 AbstractObjectives: To {{investigate}} {{the types of}} information and resources either used or required {{for the management of}} products in the pipeline as perceived by decision-makers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical (B&P) industries. More specifically, the objectives are to ascertain the strategic use of pharmacoeconomic (PE), financial, and decision- making tools and financing requirements amongst pipeline candidates. Methods: A study-specific survey instrument was used for the project. In detail, this survey is based upon the use of financial, PE, and decision-making tools for drug product development. Approximately 396 B&P firms were surveyed via postal mail, wherein the primary contact was the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). If the CFO was not listed on the firm’s website, the survey will be addressed to the Business and Development Officer (BDO) or Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The companies’ information will be identified by use of publicly-available databases. A modified form of a total survey design will be used for the postal mailings, including one initial mailing with a cover letter and survey, a <b>follow-up</b> <b>reminder</b> postcard, a second cover letter and survey for non-responders, and a final <b>follow-up</b> <b>reminder</b> postcard then after. Results: Survey instruments were completed by 20 firms, with 5 of them from public firms and 15 from the private sector. Capital and regulatory requirements and investor expectations are the most important factors considered during early and late phase clinical trials. Net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) are the most commonly used financial analytic tools used for making research and development (R&D) decisions. PE are reported to be first used during all clinical phases prior to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, and most drug candidates undergo formal PE evaluations. PE is also used in various areas of R&D and marketing components, such as licensing and go/no-go decisions. Capital/securities markets and venture capital (VC) are the primary sources of capital used {{in the development of a}} new drug. VC is important during all phases of R&D and numerous VC firms get involved. B&P firms disagree that VC companies should be involved with the managerial roles of the firm. Conclusions: It has been determined that the strategic use of PE, financial and decision-making tools, and capital requirements amongst pipeline candidates are important during all phases of R&D...|$|E

Implemented in Doha, Qatar in 2012 with 4 language groups, namely Arabic, English, Hindi, and Urdu, this research documents persons’ responses to recruitment, consent, <b>follow-up,</b> and <b>reminder</b> procedures during psychometric testing of the Multicultural Assessment Instrument (MAI), a novel self- or interviewer-administered survey. Methods Bilingual research assistants recruited adults in outpatient clinics by approaching persons in particular who appeared to be from a target language group. Participants completed the MAI, a second acculturation instrument used for content-validity assessment, and a demographics questionnaire. Participants were asked to take the MAI again in 2 – 3  weeks, in person or by post, to assess test-retest reliability. Recruitment data were analyzed by using nonparametric statistics. Results Of 1503 persons approached during recruitment, 400 enrolled (27  %) — 100 per language group. The enrollment rates in the language groups were: Arabic- 32  %; English- 33  %; Hindi- 18  %; Urdu- 30  %. The groups varied somewhat in their preferences regarding consent procedure, follow-up survey administration, contact mode for <b>follow-up</b> <b>reminders,</b> and disclosure of personal mailing address (for postal follow-up). Over all, telephone was the preferred medium for <b>follow-up</b> <b>reminders.</b> Of 64 persons who accepted a research assistant’s invitation for in-person follow-up, 40 participants completed the interview (follow-up rate, 63  %); among 126 persons in the postal group with a deliverable address, 29 participants mailed back a completed follow-up survey (response rate, 23  %). Conclusions Researchers in the Arabian Gulf face challenges to successfully identify, enroll, and retain eligible study participants.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{issue of}} poor {{response}} rates to population surveys {{has existed for}} some decades, but few studies have explored methods to improve the response rate in follow-up population cohort studies. Methods A sample of 100, 000 adults from the 45 and Up Study, a large population cohort in Australia, were followed up 3. 5  years after the baseline cohort was assembled. A pilot mail-out of 5000 surveys produced {{a response rate of}} only 41. 7  %. This study tested methods of enhancing response rate, with three groups of 1000 each allocated to (1) receiving an advance notice postcard followed by a questionnaire, (2) receiving a questionnaire and then <b>follow-up</b> <b>reminder</b> letter, and (3) both these strategies. Results The enhanced strategies all produced an improved response rate compared to the pilot, with a resulting mean response rate of 53. 7  %.

Educating physicians on issues related to prescription drug abuse is {{a key factor in}} preventing and treating this problem. High variability has been found in substance abuse terminology in the literature, textbooks, and FDA-approved product labeling. This dissertation describes a survey study designed to address how the variability in substance abuse terminology, specifically package inserts, affects the prescribing decisions made by physicians. A random sample of 1008 physicians currently licensed and residing in the Commonwealth of Virginia received a letter of explanation, a self-administered questionnaire, and a <b>follow-up</b> <b>reminder</b> and thank you. To increase response rate, a second questionnaire was sent to non-responders. Prescribing decisions made by physicians were measured as three variables: comfort level with a prior physician 2 ̆ 7 s choice, likelihood of refilling the prescription, and likelihood of prescribing a drug or drug class as the first physician seeing a particular patient. Physicians were presented with four case scenarios which included package insert information and selected patient characteristics.

40|$|Purpose – Given {{the calls}} for {{increased}} ethics education following recent corporate collapses, this paper aims to examine the significance of ethical issues that challenge the profession and, more specifically, professional accounting bodies. Design/methodology/approach – The study assesses the perceptions via an online survey of 66 professional accounting bodies worldwide in respect of ethical issues, potential causes of ethical failure {{and the need for}} ethics education. Findings – Respondents identified a number of important challenges including conflicts of interest, earnings management and whistle-blowing. The findings also demonstrate strong support for participation in prescribing the nature of ethics education by members of professional accounting bodies. Research limitations/implications – The results of this study are based on feedback from 41 per cent of member bodies of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). Despite a number of <b>follow-up</b> <b>reminder</b> notices, some regions are under-represented in the responses to the survey distributed to the (then) 160 member bodies of IFAC. Geographic isolation and language limitations contributed to the failure to gain a higher response rate.

Originality/value – By addressing member bodies' attitudes to ethics education, this paper fills a gap in prior literature that has been restricted to addressing the attitudes of academics, students and business organisations. ...|$|E
40|$|Background. It is {{important}} to minimize time and cost of physician surveys while still achieving a reasonable response rate. Mixed-mode survey administration appears to improve response rates and decrease bias. A literature review revealed physician response rates to mixed-mode surveys averaged about 68 %. However, no identified studies used the combination of e-mail, fax, and telephone. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate physician response rates based on surveys first administered by e-mail, then fax, then telephone. Methods. Surveys initially were administered by e-mail to 149 physicians utilizing SurveyMonkey©. Two <b>follow-up</b> <b>reminder</b> e-mails were sent to non-respondents at two-week intervals. Surveys then were faxed to physicians who had not responded. A follow-up fax was sent to non-respondents one week later. Finally, phone interviews were attempted with physicians who had not responded by e-mail or fax; each physician was called at least twice. Results. Of the 149 eligible physicians, 102 completed the survey for a response rate of 68. 5 %. Of those who responded, 49 (48 %) responded by e-mail, 25 (24. 5 %) by fax, and 28 (27. 5 %) by phone. Mode of response did not differ by gender, specialization, or years in practice. In addition, mode of response was not related to the primary study question, physician willingness to use text messaging for immunization reminders. Conclusions.

40|$|AIM To {{explore the}} {{opinions}} of patient reporters to the UK Yellow Card Scheme (YCS) {{on the importance of}} the scheme. METHODS Postal questionnaires were distributed on our behalf to all patient reporters submitting a Yellow Card to the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) between March and December 2008, with one <b>follow-up</b> <b>reminder</b> to non-responders. Qualitative analysis was undertaken of responses to an open question asking why respondents felt patient reporting was important. This was followed up by telephone interviews with a purposive sample of selected respondents. RESULTS There were 1362 evaluable questionnaires returned from 2008 distributed (68 %) and 1238 (91 %) respondents provided a total of 1802 comments. Twenty-seven interviews were conducted, which supported and expanded the views expressed in the questionnaire. Four main themes emerged, indicating views that the YCS was of importance to pharmacovigilance in general, manufacturers and licensing authorities, patients and the public and health professionals. Reporters viewed the YCS as an important opportunity to describe their experiences for the benefit of others and to contribute to pharmacovigilance. The scheme's independence from health professionals was regarded as important, in part to provide the patient perspective to manufacturers and regulators, but also because of dismissive attitudes and under-reporting by health professionals. CONCLUSION Direct patient reporting through the YCS is viewed as important by those who have used the scheme, in order to provide the patient experience for the benefit of pharmacovigilance, as an independent perspective from those of health professionals.

40|$|Objective. The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether Internet-based surveys of health {{professionals}} can provide a valid alternative to traditional survey methods. Methods. (i) Systematic review of published Internet-based surveys of health professionals focusing on criteria of external validity, specifically sample representativeness and response bias. (ii) Internet-based survey of GPs, exploring attitudes about using an Internet-based decision support system for the management of familial cancer. Results. The systematic review identified 17 Internet-based surveys of health professionals. Whilst most studies sampled from professional e-directories, some studies drew on unknown denominator populations by placing survey questionnaires on open web sites or electronic discussion groups. Twelve studies reported response rates, which ranged from nine to 94 %. Sending <b>follow-up</b> <b>reminders</b> resulted in a substantial increase in response rates. In our own survey of GPs, a total of 268 GPs participated (adjusted response rate = 52. 4 %) after five e-mail reminders. A further 72 GPs responded to a brief telephone survey of non-respondents. Respondents to the Internet survey were more likely to be male and had significantly greater intentions to use Internet-based decision support than non-respondents. Conclusions. Internet-based surveys provide an attractive alternative to postal and telephone surveys of health professionals, but they raise important technical and methodological issues which should be carefully considered before widespread implementation. The major obstacle is external validity, and specifically how to obtain a representative sample and adequate response rate.

40|$|Background: Ideal {{antimicrobial}} utilization includes dosing {{strategies that}} serve to optimize pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, {{such as the}} use of extended-interval dosing of aminoglycosides and extended-infusion dosing of ß-lactam antimicrobials. The adoption of these dosing strategies in pediatric patients has lagged behind the adult population. The prevalence of these dosing strategies in pediatric patients has not been well defined. Study objective: The objective of this study is to describe the use of extended-interval aminoglycoside dosing and extended and/or continuous infusion dosing of beta-lactam antimicrobials in pediatric hospitals across the country. Methods: A national survey of children 2 ̆ 7 s hospitals was conducted. Practitioners from target hospitals were identified through the Children 2 ̆ 7 s Hospital Association, and the survey was sent along with a cover letter e-mail description to identified practitioners. Practitioners received <b>follow-up</b> <b>reminders</b> to complete the survey at weeks 2 and 4, and the survey remained open for 6 weeks. The survey was conducted through SurveyMonkey®, a web-based survey program. Demographic survey questions queried presence of an antimicrobial stewardship program, presence of infectious disease specialists, institution size, and geographic location. Practice based survey questions identified whether institutions are utilizing extended-interval dosing of aminoglycosides, extended and/or continuous infusion dosing of ß-lactam antimicrobials; and reasons cited for not using these dosing strategies. This study is approved by the Butler University Institutional Review Board.

However, there remains a question regarding when MIMVS should not be performed due to an increased surgical risk. Consequently, expert surgeons were surveyed regarding their opinions on patient factors, mitral valve pathology and surgical skills in MIMVS. Surgeons experienced in MIMVS were identified through an electronic search of the literature. A link to an online survey platform was sent to all surgeons, {{as well as two}} <b>follow-up</b> <b>reminders.</b> Survey responses were then submitted to a central database and analyzed. The survey was completed by 20 surgeons. Overall results were not uniform with regard to contraindications to performing MIMVS. Some respondents do not consider left atrial enlargement (95 % of surgeons), complexity of surgery (75 %), age (70 %), aortic calcification (70 %), EuroSCORE (60 %), left ventricular ejection fraction (55 %), or obesity (50 %) to be contraindication to surgery. Ninety percent of respondents believe more than 20 cases are required to gain familiarity with the procedure, while 85 % believe at least one MIMVS case needs to be performed per week to maintain proficiency. Eighty percent recommend establishment of multi-institutional databases and standardized surgical mentoring courses, while 75 % believe MIMVS should be incorporated into current training programs for trainees. These results suggest that MIMVS has been accepted as a treatment option for patients with mitral valve pathologies according the expert panel.

40|$|Postal {{questionnaires}} {{offer one}} of the least expensive modes of collecting patient based outcomes in health care research. Many methods of increasing response to questionnaires used in educational and market research surveys have been tested. Behavioural theories have also been applied to survey research to understand response decisions. Little attention, however, has focussed specifically on response issues to postal questionnaires used to collect data in clinical trials. This {{is the subject of this}} thesis. A systematic review of methods of improving response to postal questionnaire follow-up in health care studies was conducted. A method of improving response was then devised and its effectiveness was tested within an existing clinical trial (the Collaborative Ankle Support Trial - CAST). This method was a 'Trial Calendar'which was a prompting and reminder tool to encourage response. Qualitative data were gathered from clinical trial participants to ascertain factors influencing their response decisions. Finally, the socio-demographic characteristics of CAST participants were examined. The systematic review demonstrated that <b>follow-up</b> <b>reminder</b> systems had the most significant effect on response rates (RR 1. 82, Cl 95 % 1. 11 to 2. 99). Incorporating such reminders into a tool such as the 'Trial Calendar', however, had no effect on improving response in CAST. The qualitative study revealed aspects of behavioural theories which could be incorporated into trial information and appeals for response. Analysis of the sociodemographic characteristics of CAST participants revealed that the youngest age group (16 - 24 years) was less likely to respond at every followup point. It is concluded that rather than anticipating low response rates and striving to devise methods of converting non-responders into responders, efforts should be directed at preventing participants becoming non-responders in the first place. This thesis argues for the area of follow-up to postal questionnaires in clinical trials to become a theoretical research issue in its own right.

40|$|More rapid {{than normal}} {{global climate change}} as {{represented}} by rising temperatures and more erratic and severe weather events have heightened the interest in how farmers use weather information. The greenhouse influence through driving climate change will likely be affecting agricultural efforts for some years to come. It behooves us {{to pay attention to}} this phenomenon, and especially put effort into understanding how farmers will respond to information about climate generally and forecasts in particular. This research is being funded by the U. S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. To address this issue farmers were surveyed in three major agroecological zones representing 1) a western Corn Belt, rainfed corn-soybean regime, 2) a central Great Plains irrigated corn-soybean regime, and 3) a central Great Plains irrigated continuous corn regime. Each of these zones is represented in three counties in eastern Nebraska. To better reflect farmers' weather related needs and issues, focus groups were held in each county to engage farmers in helping the researchers to design the survey instrument. The fact we used focus groups added an intriguing flavor to the study. Between 15 - 20 farmers in each zone were involved. These farmers were paid $ 25 for a 2 -hour session that culminated in a provided lunch. Each session was also videotaped, providing the opportunity for all members of the research team to see the results of the event (in that only 3 - 4 members of the larger multidisciplinary research team were allowed to attend an event, due to concerns over affecting farmer responses). The focus was on the farmers' reactions to a series of questions prepared beforehand by the research team, all of which stirred lively dialogue on how farmers actually use weather information. The result was a substantially improved questionnaire. We also sent drafts back to farmer participants for final reviews, and subsequent adjustments were then made reflecting the way they used the words and understood the survey questions. The qualitative data from the focus group events ultimately influenced not only the way questions were asked but also how the modeling is done, and, especially, how the model results are interpreted. A total of 2211 questionnaires were sent, in two separate mailings. There was also a <b>follow-up</b> <b>reminder</b> card. Farmers were offered a payment of $ 25 to return the questionnaire. A total of 28 % took the offer and the overall return rate was 33 %, with 698 usable questionnaires in the econometric analysis. A distinctive aspect of this study {{is the fact that the}} research team involves active participation not only by agricultural economists but also by a psychologist and a social psychologist, as well as two meteorologists, and an agronomist (who is also a GIS specialist). The result is a nontraditional behavioral economics approach that is sensitive to the climate and agronomic realities faced by farmers in these zones. This approach has a unique two-fold feature; first, it puts special attention on underlying motives, and second, asks whether there may be a complex expression of both private (self) and public (other, community) interest in how forecasts influence farm level decisions. Yet, the modeling still reflects standard derived demand theory and the general expectancy-value or subjective utility perspective, i. e. that farmers have beliefs about fact events and values relating to the outcomes from those events, and that the demand for weather information is derived from the value (profit, sense of well-being, risk-reducing value) it produces for them. The beliefs represent probability statements about outcomes and the values represent the utility or profit related transformations of meaning about the farmer perceptions of the outcomes. The econometric analysis uses proxy measures of the expectancy-value as independent measures, along with such variables as financial capability of the farmer as represented in farm sales, to explain in a Tobit kind of framework 1) the probability of applying weather forecast information since it influences farm level decision(s), and 2) the extent to which this forecast information is influencing these decision(s). The set of four Tobit models in Table 1 test the influence of recent past and current experience (RPE), short (STF) and long-term forecasts (LTF) on 1) agronomic (e. g. selecting the crop type, spraying), 2) insurance, and 3) marketing decisions, within recent past experience/short-term and long-term forecasts. To test the models, we created four indices represented in balance (joint and nonseparable ratio of public (other) to private (self) interests); attitude as a construct of personal belief and value system, influence of social norms, household and community members, county extension, etc; farmers' need for internal control over crop production; and farm sales representing financial limitations. Preliminary analyses suggest that all the farm decisions are influenced by weather forecast information at a different intensity (Table 1). The probability of that influence increases with balance, as the farmer puts more effort into pursuing the self over the community interests. Influence of others and social norms intensify the use of weather information in the decisions as well. Those who want more control over the farm are likely to be more influenced by weather forecasts. Finally, influence of weather forecasts becomes greater as gross farm income (sales) increases. Other intriguing interpretations are suggested by the changes in the size of the parameter elasticities and marginal effects 3, e. g. the control parameter is substantively smaller in the insurance decision, which suggests farmers see insurance as offsetting the need for more control over their decisions. As another example, the balance in private and public interests is less significant and less a factor in the very personal, private marketing decision in contrast to "how one farms" (which is likely more sensitive to community scrutiny) in the agronomic decisions. The larger paper explores these refinements in greater detail. Table 1. Intensity of Weather Forecast Influence on Farm Decisions. Variables Agronomy (Cur. Rec.

40|$|Aim: To {{ascertain}} {{the design and}} operational characteristics of acute Medical Assessment Units (MAU) located within Australasian hospitals, and to compare these with formal standards promulgated by the Internal Medicine Society of Australia and New Zealand (IMSANZ). Method: Descriptive study based on responses to questionnaires mailed to clinical and nursing leads of MAU in March 2009 with <b>follow-up</b> <b>reminders</b> over 3 months. Hospitals that had an MAU that met predefined criteria were identified from an IMSANZ directory of sites based on recent contact with IMSANZ members and health department personnel and interrogation of hospital websites and attendance lists at recent MAU workshops. Results: Questionnaires were returned from 32 of 50 hospitals (response rate 64 %). Most MAU (15 / 22; 68 %) were less than 2 years old. MAU were smaller than recommended by IMSANZ. Sixty-eight per cent were located over a 5 -min walk from the emergency department (ED). Delay in transfer of patients from the ED to the MAU was common. The medical service {{to the majority of}} MAU was provided by General Medicine physicians and cover was reduced at weekends. In the majority of MAU the emphasis on function was facilitating discharge of patients rather than managing patients with high acuity of illness. Conclusions: Our survey suggests that despite some variation in staffing and procedures, MAU seem to be well established and a promising means of decreasing ED access block. Future comparative study is required to evaluate further the effect of MAU on ED access block and ED length of stay. G. B. S. McNeill, C. Brand, K. Clark, G. Jenkins, I. Scott, C. Thompson and P.

40|$|Introduction: Opportunities for {{the early}} {{detection}} of disease are not sufficiently being taken advantage of. Specific interventions could increase the uptake of prevention programmes. A comprehensive analysis of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these interventions with reference to Germany is still needed. Objectives: This report aimed to describe and assess interventions to increase uptake in primary and secondary prevention and to explore the assessment of their cost-effectiveness. Methods: 29 scientific databases were systematically searched in a wide strategy. Additional references were located from bibliographies. All published systematic reviews and primary studies were assessed for inclusion without language restrictions. Teams of two reviewers identified the literature, extracted data and assessed {{the quality of the}} publications independently. Results: Four HTA reports and 22 systematic reviews were identified for the medical evaluation covering a variety of interventions. The economic evaluation was based on two HTA-reports, one meta-analysis and 15 studies. The evidence was consistent for the effectiveness of invitations and reminders aimed at users, and for prompts aimed at health care professionals. These interventions were the most commonly analysed. (Financial) Incentives for users and professionals were identified in a small number of studies. Limited evidence was available for cost-effectiveness showing incremental costs for <b>follow-up</b> <b>reminders</b> and invitations by telephone. Evidence for ethical, social and legal aspects pointed to needs in vulnerable populations. Discussion: The material was heterogeneous regarding interventions used, study populations and settings. The majority of references originated from the United States and focused on secondary prevention. Approaching all target groups by invitations and reminders was recommended to increase uptake in prevention programmes in general. Conclusions: Further research should aim to focus on primary prevention. Future research should also focus on specific interventions aiming to include vulnerable target groups and individuals, who have not previously made use of opportunities for prevention...|$|R
40|$|Service-learning is an {{important}} teaching pedagogy that has been proven effective in enhancing student learning and promoting both academic and civic engagement. As civic engagement continues to gain prominence as an integral aspect of higher education, it is increasingly important that engagement metrics are consistently measured to demonstrate outcomes. This {{is especially true of}} service-learning as it strongly correlates with student learning, academic performance, and retention rates. Feedback and suggestions from service-learning faculty members are useful for gaining insights into how service-learning quality can be enhanced at the classroom level and understanding the resource needs of faculty members. The purpose of the Service-Learning Faculty Survey was to assess (a) the level of support that faculty members receive for their service-learning/community engagement activities and (b) the impact they believe their service-learning/community engagement work has had. The evaluation asked questions on the following dimensions: 1. Perceived support, 2. Usefulness of supports provided and received, 3. Partnerships, 4. Scholarship, and 5. Impact. The results will serve two purposes. First, information gathered will be utilized in VCU‟s renewal of its Community Engagement Classification through the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. In addition, the results will help the Service-Learning Office improve the services and supports it provides {{to meet the needs of}} service-learning instructors. Data was collected from faculty members who had taught at least one service-learning course during the 2011 - 2012 academic year. Appropriate faculty member were identified by VCU‟s Service Learning office (n= 69). These individuals were sent a confidential, online survey using Qualtrics (a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies). Faculty members were sent an invitation and two <b>follow-up</b> <b>reminders</b> to complete the survey...|$|R
40|$|The dentist {{workforce}} is {{the primary}} provider of oral health care to Indiana residents. In 2014, there were 3, 982 dentists who held an active license in Indiana. These dentists were not surveyed during their re-licensure period, as {{has been done in}} the past, but were contacted by the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency (IPLA) via email in the fall of 2014 and asked to complete a brief survey. Despite <b>follow-up</b> <b>reminders</b> from IPLA and the Indiana Dentist Association (IDA) survey response was low (13. 4 %). The previous survey, which was administered during dentists’ 2012 re-licensure period, had a response rate of 80. 7 percent. Of the 3, 982 actively licensed dentists who were offered the survey, there were 532 respondents. Only 424 dentists were included in this analysis after filtering respondents to include only those who were actively licensed, practicing in Indiana, and currently practicing as dentists. Because of the small proportion of the actively licensed dentist workforce in Indiana that is represented in this analysis, it is unclear whether this sample is representative of the overall workforce. Comparing 2014 survey data with 2012 survey data indicated similar patterns in dental specialty and hours worked per week. However, slightly more rural dentists responded to the 2014 survey than the 2012 survey. Comparisons between responders and non-responders to the 2014 survey indicate that those who completed the survey were older than those who did not. The collection of high quality health workforce data is dependent upon reaching {{a large proportion of the}} health workforce. The low response rate to this survey suggests that this methodology is not optimal for collecting data on Indiana’s health professional workforces. Survey response fell by 67. 3 percent compared to the 2012 dentist re-licensure survey. Embedding the survey instrument in the health professional re-licensure process has consistently yielded high (> 80 %) response rates across all health professions and should be considered as the primary method of survey administration for future data collection...|$|R

The problems addressed in this study concerned identification and evaluation of similarities and differences in the levels of job satisfaction between two randomly selected sample groups of substitute and regular classroom teachers. Generation of data was accomplished through use of the Purdue Teacher Opinionaire. All 86 Lee County substitutes and 109 of the 329 Lee County regular classroom teachers participated in this study. The design of the study called for completion of the Purdue Teacher Opinionaire by each of the respondents. Similarities and contrasts were made in terms of each group's overall job satisfaction as well as job satisfaction levels reflected in the ten factors related to the job of teaching. Job satisfaction levels were analyzed in terms of the ages, teaching levels and educational training of the sample groups' members. Differences in job satisfaction scores were considered significant at the. 05 level. Opinionnaires were mailed to the two sample groups along with self-addressed, stamped envelopes. Two <b>follow-up</b> <b>reminders</b> were used; these resulted in a final opinionnaire return of 84 percent. Results of this study indicated that significant main effect differences existed between the substitute and regular classroom teacher groups on the five factors of "Rapport Among Teachers," "Teacher Salary," "Teacher Status," "Community Support of Education," and "School Facilities and Services" when analyzed by group and ages. There were significant interactions between type of teacher (regular and substitute) and age on the variables of "Curriculum Issues" and "Teacher Status. "There were significant main effect differences between the substitute and regular classroom teacher groups on the factors of "Teacher Salary," "Teacher Status," "Community Support of Education," and "School Facilities and Services" when results were analyzed by group and teaching levels. There were significant main effect differences between the substitute and regular classroom teacher groups on the factors of "Rapport Among Teachers," "Teacher Salary," "Teacher Status," and "School Facilities and Services" when results were analyzed by group and educational training. No significant interaction was identified in the group analyses by teaching levels or by educational training. The conclusions developed from the study were: (1) Substitute teachers were significantly more job satisfied than regular classroom teachers in four of ten factors related to job satisfaction. (2) Substitute teachers were significantly less satisfied with their rapport with other teachers than were their full-time teacher counterparts. (3) Substitute teachers were significantly more satisfied with salaries, teacher status, community support of education, and school facilities and services than were the full-time teachers. (4) Substitute teachers were significantly less satisfied with their involvements in curriculum issues as they became older than were their full-time counterparts who did not exhibit comparable declines in feelings of satisfaction.

40|$|Failure to {{follow-up}} on abnormal {{tests is}} a common clinical concern comprising the quality of care. Although many clinicians track their patient follow-up by scheduling follow-up visits or by leaving physical reminders, most feel that automated, computerized systems to track abnormal test results would be useful. While existing clinical decision support systems and computerized clinical reminders focus on providing assistance with choosing the appropriate follow-up management, they fail by not tracking that follow-up effectively. We believe that clinicians do not want suggestions how to manage their patients, but instead want help tracking follow-up results once they have decided the management plan. We believe that a well-designed system can successfully track this follow-up and only require {{a small amount of}} information and time from the clinician. We have designed and implemented a complete tracking system including 1) an authoring tool to define tracking guidelines, 2) a query tool to search electronic medical records and identify patients without follow-up, and 3) a clinical tool to send reminders to clinicians and allow them to easily choose the follow-up management. Our tracking system has made improvements on previous reminder systems by 1) using our unique risk-management guideline model that more closely mirrors, yet does not attempt to replicate, the clinical decision process, 2) our use of massive population-based queries for tracking all patients simultaneously, and 3) our longitudinal approach that documents all steps in the patient follow-up cycle. With these developments, we are able to track 450 million pieces of clinical data for 1. 8 million patients daily. (cont.)
