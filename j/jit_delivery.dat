40|$|We {{consider}} {{the situation of}} a supplier plant whose customer plants desire just-in-time (<b>JIT)</b> <b>deliveries.</b> Randomness in both the production and demand processes make satisfying every demand that might occur in true JIT fashion impossible. Therefore, supplier plants typically negotiate bounds on JIT contracts with their customers. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} use of "quotas" or "target inventory levels" as a mechanism for establishing such bounds.

In this paper, we {{consider the}} problem of setting an appropriate quota {{from the perspective of the}} supplier plant and interpret our results in the context of the negotiation process between the supplier and its customers. Under the assumption that "safety capacity" (i. e., overtime or a vendoring option) is available, we develop two models that address this problem. The first model assumes that quota shortfalls cannot be carried over to the next regular time production period and are made up with overtime/vendoring, which incurs fixed plus variable costs. The second model assumes that shortages can be backlogged to the next regular time production period at a cost. We use numerical examples to demonstrate how the models we developed were used by a clutch supplier to a large auto manufacturer to negotiate its JIT contracts. pull systems, just-in-time, production control, supply chain management...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the rationale and the fundamental elements and algorithms of a reliability engineering methodology, and discusses {{its application to}} the design of a large, multi-cell and heterogeneous production system with just-in-time (<b>JIT)</b> <b>deliveries.</b> The failure analysis and the non-reliability costs assessment of such systems is a complex task. In order to cope with such complexity, a two level hierarchical modelling and evaluation framework was developed. According to this framework, the internal behaviour of each manufacturing cell and the overall flow of materials are described, respectively, by local and global models. Local models are firstly obtained from the failure and repair processes of the manufacturing equipment. Then, these models are combined with the failure propagation delays introduced by the work-in-process buffers in order to obtain the system level model. The second part of the paper addresses several design issues of the production system that directly impact the reliability of the deliveries, such as the layout of the plant, the redundancy of the manufacturing equipment and the capacity of the work-in-process buffers. A distinctive feature of the reliability evaluation algorithm resides on the ability to deal with reliability models containing stochastic processes with generalized distributions. This fundamental requirement {{comes from the fact that}} repair and failure propagation processes typically present hyper-exponential distributions, e. g., lognormal distributions, that can’t be assessed using the conventional reliability techniques.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study whether just in time (JIT) supply {{practices}} interact with JIT production practices by positively moderating the relationship between JIT production and efficiency/delivery performance. Design/methodology/approach – In total, six hypotheses are developed on the relationships between JIT production, JIT supply, efficiency and delivery performance. The hypotheses are tested through a hierarchical regression analysis using data from a sample of 207 manufacturing plants. Findings – JIT production practices positively affect both efficiency and <b>delivery.</b> <b>JIT</b> supply practices positively moderate the relationship between <b>JIT</b> production and <b>delivery,</b> while there is no significant moderating effect when considering the impact on efficiency. The role of JIT supply as moderator is twofold. On the one hand, it strengthens the positive impact of <b>JIT</b> production on <b>delivery</b> through a complementary effect. On the other hand, low levels of adoption of JIT supply practices can hinder and – for extremely low levels – cancel the impact of JIT production practices on delivery. Practical implications – When efficiency is the priority, companies should direct their efforts on JIT production. However, when their aim is to maximize delivery, they should invest on both JIT production and JIT supply. Results found advise managers to implement some JIT supply practices during the early stages of JIT production programs, because the total absence of any JIT linkages with suppliers can limit JIT production benefits on delivery performance. Originality/value – This study elaborates on the mutual influence between JIT production and JIT supply practices and demonstrates that they have a different weight and contribute to different aspects of performance improvement. This can help managers involved in JIT implementation to better allocate scarce resources...|$|R

At the momentit {{is one of the}} fastest growing markets today with 12. 1 % growth last year (2004). The growth originates from high oil price, which has been accumulated to people's wages. They are growing nominally more than 20 % annually. But even though the income increases, the share of food of all retailtrade has been fairly stable with only a slight decline. Thus, the consumption is shifting to products with more quality and value. The shareof modern retail outlets is low, as the Russian retail sector is still very dispersed to traditional retail outlets such as kiosks, open markets and small grocery stores. The store chains are, however, becoming more and more significant. The biggest market for retailers is Moscow but nowadays the chains are expanding rapidly into other regions. Even though the markets have not been saturated in Moscow, the best prospects for growth are in the regions. The most important factor restricting the growth in Moscowis the availability of real estate and land plots for stores. The market is moving forward to saturation, and a consolidation process will follow. In fact, it has already started but not many acquisitions have been made so far. To this point the domestic chains have settled to form only alliances. The foreign players will be very strong in the tightening competition in the future. The problem of domestic chains is that the stores are nonstandardized, which is not cost-efficient. The chains are trying to enhance their power in price negotiations by forming purchasing alliances, introducing private label goods and using the regional expansion as a striking weapon. In order to follow the growing chains to other regions the producer must sell its products to the chains at favorable terms.

30|$|Daniel and Reitsperger (1996) {{revealed}} that by improving manufacturing flexibility and decreasing in-process inventories JIT enhances reduction in lot sizes capabilities of a firm. It is essential during implementation to continuously monitor the production plans {{in order to}} {{recognize the importance of}} JIT mechanisms.. JIT production process refers to the adoption of practices aiming at the reorganization of shop floor and streamlining production flows within production plants (Furlan et al. 2010), JIT production (Inman and Mehra 1991) and Internal JIT (Furlan et al. 2010). Some of the commonly used JIT production practices involve set up time reduction, daily schedule adherence, small lot size, kanban based pull systems, cell layout (u-shapped) and heijunka boxes (Mackelprang and Nair 2010; Motwani 2003). JIT supply is a practical implementation of the pul logic (Sakakibara et al. 1997) where efficiency is obtained through suppliers by ensuring frequent and unintrupted delivery and that too in small lots. Most of the authors argued that JIT production needed low inventories and fast throughputs and JIT supply is critical for the maintenance of the continuous flow of raw materials or components from upstream (Hsu et al. 2009; Panizzolo 1998). Even though this confirmation is suggesting that JIT supply and production are severely interrelated practices and that operations can be benefited from joint implementation of them, empirical studies are lacking in investigating this linkage. As with respect to the effect of JIT production practices, research shows that set up time minimization, concurrent use of cellular manufacturing, pull systems and adherence of daily schedule provides a continuous material flow that is to be achieved throughout the production lines, hance reducing work in-process inventory and unnecessary delays in flow time. It further contributes in minimizing the manufacturing costs, speeding up the core activities and ensuring on-time delivery performance (Brown and Mitchell 1991; Manoocheri 1984). Mackelprang and Nair (2010) reveal that the positive association between <b>JIT</b> production, <b>delivery</b> performances and efficiency is generally emphasized in various empirical studies. So, we can hypothesize that the implementation of JIT production practices may {{have a positive impact on}} operational performance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It is {{now widely}} {{recognized}} that new Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have been {{changing the way}} by which firms conduct their businesses.

These new ways of conducting businesses are believed to help firms to reduce transaction costs and increase productivity. As a result, new ICTs have {{played an important role in}} recent growth of many small firms into multi-functional and multi-product corporations and in their spatial expansion towards internationalization as well.

40|$|The 1990 's were {{a time of}} {{downsizing}} and consolidation {{for much of the}} defense aerospace industry. Many defense contractors sought to integrate lean manufacturing principles and techniques into their business, as a means of becoming more cost-competitive in bidding for a shrinking defense budget, and to enable moves into commercial product lines. UTC-Sikorsky Aircraft Company began a series of restructuring and re-engineering initiatives in the late 1990 's aimed at addressing these issues. This internship focused on cost reduction in Sikorsky's main product line - the UH- 60 Blackhawk helicopter. The final assembly line for the UH- 60 was subject to cost and schedule overruns, along with high inventory levels. The assembly line was also characterized by a high degree of variability, and a major source of variability was believed to be the lack of a defined and repeatable sequence for the installations that comprise final ass~mbly. The introduction of an optimized assembly sequence, and subsequent adoption for daily use by shop floor personnel, was expected to reduce variability and improve performance. The use of a sequence itself was expected to produce the following benefits: 1. Provide a significant improvement in the use of visual tools for line management. 2. Help capture valuable information about installations from workers, and then transfer this knowledge to management, planners, and new workers as personnel are rotated through the factory. 3. Enable significant inventory reduction through introduction of a just-in-time (<b>JIT)</b> material <b>delivery</b> methodology, by linking material delivery to the order in which it is consumed. Implementation was expected to aid in identifying the shortcomings and limitations of the systems that have prevented the use of a sequencing methodology in the past. More importantly, it would elevate the importance of addressing and solving these issues as a means to achieve company-wide goals for cost and inventory reduction. Through implementation of this sequence, key issues were identified: [...] JIT inventory levels are difficult to achieve in a large, complex aerospace assembly process, [...] The manufacturing system, along with systems and processes which support it, must be capable of supporting JIT prior to implementation (and may need to be redesigned to do so), and [...] Process re-engineering to support JIT is best accomplished through a combination of top-down and bottom-up change processes. by James Aaron Wolters, II.

In addition, this paper aims to comprehend how Building Information Modelling (BIM) could support CDWM in the case area. This paper presents a case area of Swedish construction industry, {{and the results are}} based on observation, semi-structured interviews, and questionnaires. The current practice of case area’s CDWM includes on-site sorting, reuse, recycling, Just-in-time <b>delivery</b> (<b>JIT),</b> using prefabricated construction materials and color-coded waste containers. The practice of the CDWM mainly focused on sorting and recycling. The information regarding CDWM was shared among project stakeholders by using brochures, presentation, meeting, and information board. In addition, the contractor and subcontractors have a contract that stated who is responsible {{to take care of the}} waste on site. The use of BIM has been given attention in the current literature to support CDWM. BIM has not been used for CDWM in the case study. However, the case study’s company has an optimistic view about how BIM could support CDWM. Additionally, there is positive effort to implement BIM for CDWM for future projects at the company level. If BIM is used for case area’s CDWM, it could support the CDWM in many ways, such as minimizing CDW through design validation, providing material information regarding waste, and quantifying the generation of waste before construction or demolition. To bring change and improvement in the current practices of case area’s CDWM, there should be an education, workshop, and training regarding the concept of CDWM, waste management strategies and benefits of BIM in managing CDW to construction project participants. This, in turn, can help the case study’s firm and the general public to attain environmental, social and economic benefit from CDWM...|$|R

It deals with the design and management of products, processes, services and supply chains and considers the acquisition, development, and effective and efficient utilization of resources. Unlike other engineering subjects, content of these units could be very wide and vast. It is therefore necessary to cover the content that is most related to the contemporary industries. It is also necessary to understand what engineering management skills are critical for engineers working in the contemporary organisations. Most of the operations management books contain traditional Operations Management techniques. For example ‘inventory management’ is an important topic in operations management. All OM books deal with effective method of inventory management. However, new trend in OM is Just in time (<b>JIT)</b> <b>delivery</b> or minimization of inventory. It is therefore important to decide whether to emphasise on keeping inventory (as suggested by most books) or minimization of inventory. Similarly, for OM decisions like forecasting, optimization and linear programming most organisations now a day’s use software. Now it is important for us to determine whether some of these software need to be introduced in tutorial/ lab classes. If so, what software? It is established in the Teaching and Learning literature that there must be a strong alignment between unit objectives, assessment and learning activities to engage students in learning. Literature also established that engaging students is vital for learning. However, engineering units (more specifically Operations management) is quite different from other majors. Only alignment between objectives, assessment and learning activities cannot guarantee student engagement. Unit content must be practical oriented and skills to be developed should be those demanded by the industry. Present active learning research, using a multi-method research approach, redesigned the operations management content based on latest developments in Engineering Management area and the necessity of Australian industries. The redesigned unit has significantly helped better student engagement and better learning. It was found that students are engaged in the learning if they find the contents are helpful in developing skills that are necessary in their practical life. ...|$|E
