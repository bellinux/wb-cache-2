5|$|Blackwolf, {{co-founder of}} the Champions and Damsel's ex-husband. A Batman-like character, he is the team's only {{unpowered}} member, but he is athletically trained and intellectually gifted. He <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> the death of family members and has mild autism. He divides his time between managing his successful corporation and work as a superhero.|$|E
5|$|Robert Hawkins (Kevin Michael Richardson) – A {{social worker}} who runs the Freeman Community Center as head counselor. He is a widower and the single father of two teenagers—Virgil and Sharon. He dislikes gangs and the {{destructive}} attitudes of most Bang Babies, and {{his work at the}} community center <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> a desire to counteract their bad influence on young people.|$|E
5|$|James Frain plays Kieran Ashton, {{a former}} {{colleague}} of Karl, who faked his suicide {{and became the}} Truth Terrorist, serving as the primary antagonist. The character <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> {{the loss of his}} identity and family, as well as betrayal from Karl by his affair with Kieran's wife before her death. Frain believed that Kieran is the most disturbing character he has played. Portraying the character, the actor wanted to make his actions understandable, though not justifiable.|$|E
50|$|Theory Y puts forward {{that workers}} <b>are</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> higher order needs and tend towards {{self-control}} and self-direction. People {{have the capacity}} to problem-solve, <b>are</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> affiliation, esteem and the possibility of self-actualization besides physiological and security needs.|$|R
50|$|Like many EAs, BBO <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> {{a natural}} process; in particular, BBO <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> biogeography, which <b>is</b> {{the study of}} the {{distribution}} of biological species through time and space. BBO was originally introduced by Dan Simon in 2008.|$|R

5|$|The main {{theme of}} Minority Report {{is the classic}} {{philosophical}} debate of free will versus determinism. Other themes explored by the film include involuntary commitment, the nature of political and legal systems in a high technology-advanced society, the rights of privacy in a media-dominated world, {{and the nature of}} self-perception. The film also continues to follow Spielberg's tradition of depicting broken families,*Vest. pg. 136 which he has said <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> his parents' divorce when he was a child.|$|E
5|$|Boyer {{observes the}} {{distinction}} between how nonhuman animals can receive political protection {{as individuals and as}} species. He argues that the latter form of protection <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> a desire to preserve human experience of the species rather than the experiences of the nonhuman animals themselves. Politically motivated species advocacy, Boyer argues, is highly anthropocentric, as advocates present these animals as sharing in particular revered virtues; as a result, the likes of habitat and genetic health are the focus of advocates, rather than the nonhuman animals themselves. Using the example of polar bear preservation, Boyer illustrates how species advocacy becomes tied up with broader political goals concerning humans and competing visions of the value of animals. He concludes that the advancement of species advocacy can limit the achievement of animal welfare/rights goals.|$|E
5|$|Money is {{important}} throughout the film. Concerns about money dominate {{much of the}} film—for example, a large portion is devoted to Wei and her students' attempt to earn enough money for bus tickets—as well as motivating them. Most major characters, including Wei, demand payment for their actions, and it is left unclear whether Wei's search for Zhang Huike <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> altruism or {{by the promise of}} a 10-yuan bonus. Zhu Ying points out the prominence of money in the film creates a conflict between traditional Confucian values (such as the implication that the solutions to Wei's problems can be found through the help of authority figures) and modern, capitalist and individualistic society.|$|E

5000|$|While {{the protests}} that sparked the {{creation}} of the Conch Republic (and others since then) have been described by some as [...] "tongue-in-cheek," [...] they <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> frustrations over genuine concerns. The original protest event <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> a U.S. Border Patrol roadblock and checkpoint that greatly inconvenienced residents and tourists.|$|R
5|$|The {{body of the}} man killed {{outside the}} bowling alley is discovered, missing a tongue. It is {{identified}} as a retired police officer, Detective Mellen, who had given false testimony that had sent Annie Tisman's late husband to prison. Black realizes that the killer <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> the need to right wrongs such as this, killing those who have gotten away with crimes. Meanwhile, The Judge passes sentence on another victim—a slumlord whose negligence caused a tenant's death. Bardale is ordered to cut the landlord's leg off while he is still alive; the leg is later found in a postal depot in a package.|$|E
5|$|Hemingway's stories {{typically}} position {{nature as}} a source of refuge and rebirth. His characters are often shown retreating to the country in search of regeneration. Nature acts as the setting for hunters' or fishermen's existential moment of transcendence—especially at the moment when prey is killed. In Big Two-Hearted River, Nick walks away from a ruined town, and enters the woods to hike toward the river, unharmed by the fire. His journey <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> absolution; the river is described as two-hearted because it gives life in the form of food (fish) and offers redemption. In the woods, Nick stops in a grove of trees that is described as chapel-like, a description that echoes Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage in which Henry Fleming flees to a chapel-like grove of trees. In the grove Nick sleeps well {{for the first time since}} the war, and there he begins the healing process. The next morning he goes to the river, wading into the water to fish. At first the strength of the current frightens him, and for some moments he has difficulty controlling himself.|$|E
25|$|The {{dimension}} is calibrated by dim k = n. This axiom <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> regarding the polynomial ring in n variables as an algebraic analogue of n-dimensional space.|$|E

50|$|The {{motivation}} of suicide attackers varies. Kamikaze acted under military orders and <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> obedience and nationalism. Before 2003, most attacks targeted forces occupying the attackers' homeland, according to analyst Robert Pape. Anthropologist Scott Atran states that since 2004 {{the overwhelming majority}} of bombers have <b>been</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> the ideology of Islamist martyrdom.|$|R
50|$|The Temperance {{movement}} in Sri Lanka <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> Buddhism and anti-colonialism.|$|R
25|$|Standardized Kt/V <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> {{the steady}} state {{solution}} of the mass transfer equation often used to approximate kidney function (equation 1), which {{is also used to}} define clearance.|$|E
25|$|The auto encoder idea <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> {{the concept}} of a good {{representation}}. For example, for a classifier, a good representation can be defined as one that yields a better-performing classifier.|$|E
25|$|Chris Cooper (Kevin McDonald, Jason Barr, younger) is the {{inventor}} of the drug, and main protagonist of the film. He <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> the clumsy suicide of his father (also played by McDonald) to create a cure for clinical depression, but quickly gets swept up in the resulting fame.|$|E

50|$|An egg donor may <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> {{to donate}} eggs for altruistic reasons. A survey of 80 American women showed that 30% <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> {{altruism}} alone, another 20% were attracted only by monetary compensation, while 40% of donors <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> both reasons. The same {{study found that}} 45% of egg donors were students {{the first time they}} donated and averaged $4,000 for each donation.|$|R
25|$|In January 2009, the Baku authorities' {{demolition}} of the 26 Commissars Memorial commemorating the 26 Baku Commissars began {{and was soon}} completed. It upset Armenia, as the Armenian public believed that reburial <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> the reluctance of the Azerbaijanis to have ethnic Armenians buried {{in the center of}} their capital, due to the Nagorno-Karabakh War.|$|E
25|$|In Scanning {{fluorescence}} {{correlation spectroscopy}} (sFCS) the measurement volume is moved across the sample in a defined way. The introduction of scanning <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> its ability to alleviate or remove several distinct problems often encountered in standard FCS, and thus, to extend the range of applicability of fluorescence correlation methods in biological systems.|$|E
25|$|The ADL {{referred}} to the book as antisemitic, though Duke had denied {{the claim that the}} book <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> antisemitism. At one time, the book was sold in the main lobby of the building of Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament). The first printing of 5,000 copies sold out in several weeks.|$|E

25|$|Formal {{methods are}} a {{particular}} kind of mathematics based techniques for the specification, development and verification of software and hardware systems. The use of formal methods for software and hardware design <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, Ronald Langacker's {{cognitive}} grammar {{framework is}} described as a type of construction grammar. Cognitive grammar deals mainly with the semantic content of constructions, and its central argument is that conceptual semantics is primary to the degree that form mirrors, or <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by,</b> content. Langacker argues that even abstract grammatical units like part-of-speech classes are semantically motivated and involve certain conceptualizations.|$|E
25|$|Henley’s (1977) {{research}} {{found that a}} person in power {{is more likely to}} touch a subordinate, but the subordinate is not free to touch in kind. Touch is a powerful nonverbal communication tool and this different standard between a superior and subordinate can lead to confusion whether the touch <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> dominance or intimacy according to Borisoff and Victor.|$|E
