40|$|Following the {{recommendation}} made by Rittenberg (1999), this study encompasses the broader nature of internal auditing that is evolving {{in practice and}} confirmed by the revised definition of internal auditing and the new Professional Practices Framework, both issued by the IIA in 1999. This study, based on six extended case studies, attempts {{to contribute to the}} literature by studying contemporary internal auditing practices in Belgium (assurance and / or consulting oriented), refining the influence of three predefined variables (reporting relationship, organisational support and internal control system) and determining other important influencing variables. Most internal auditing activities could be classified as a combination of assurance and consulting services. Moreover, we recognised a limited proportion of pure assurance activities and a sometimes quite extensive proportion of pure consulting activities. On the one hand, a strong administrative reporting relationship with management, a strong organisational support, a weak internal control system and a relatively young internal auditing department are in most cases associated with relatively higher proportion of consulting oriented activities. On the other hand, a strong <b>functional</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>relationship</b> with the audit committee, a weak organisational support, a strong internal control system and a more mature internal auditing department are linked with a relatively higher proportion of assurance oriented activities. Based on the results of this study, specific hypotheses for further research are presented. internal auditing, Belgium, extended case studies, assurance, consulting, reporting relationship, organisational support, internal control system, maturity...|$|E
40|$|Several {{proteins}} encoded by PD {{genes are}} implicated in synaptic vesicle traffic. Endophilin, {{a key factor}} in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles, was shown to bind to, and be ubiquitinated by, the PD-linked E 3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin. Here we report that Parkin's level is specifically upregulated in brain and fibroblasts of endophilin mutant mice due to increased transcriptional regulation. Studies of transfected HEK 293 T cells show that Parkin ubiquitinates not only endophilin, but also its major binding partners, dynamin and synaptojanin 1. These results converge with the recently <b>reported</b> <b>functional</b> <b>relationship</b> of endophilin to the PD gene LRRK 2 and with the identification of a PD-linked synaptojanin 1 mutation, in providing evidence for a link between PD and endocytosis genes...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} the internal audit <b>reporting</b> <b>relationships</b> in the selected public enterprises, to see the influence of the internal audit <b>reporting</b> <b>relationship.</b> Internal audit is facing many challenges, some of the challenges identified by the Ministry of Finance and Development, in Internal Audit Manual are: lack of expertise leading to trivial auditing findings, lack of opportunity for professional development & repetitive audit routines which staffed members can predict. To obtain the required information open-and close-ended questionnaires were used as data gathering tools in three (3) public enterprises in East Arsi from where 36 employees were given questionnaires thirty three (33) of them have been properly filled and returned. A sample of 36 respondents was selected purposively. Data was analyzed using statistical package for Social Scientists (SPSS) Version 16. 0 Windows Software. The findings of the study showed that the involvement of IAF in managerial matters is very much limited, the scope of internal audit in all of the surveyed enterprises were very much narrow and not yet set free from the traditional thoughts of what an IAF should be. The study, therefore, recommended that, the public enterprises should revise their reporting lines and separate the <b>functional</b> <b>reporting</b> from the administrative reporting.
