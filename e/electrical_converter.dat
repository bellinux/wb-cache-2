Radio over fiber means the optical signal is being modulated at radio frequencies and transmitted via the optical fiber. By using this technology, we can transport the radio frequency (RF) signal over few kilometers with minimal loss. ROF link is a promising technology for short range transmission applications within multimode polymer optical fibers. Typically, the radio over fiber link employs a single mode fiber. But the signal power at the remote antenna is very small.

40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} {{is currently}} a hot research topic, mainly {{as a consequence of}} the increasing attractiveness of computing and sensing solutions based on small, low-power distributed embedded systems. Harvesting may enable systems to operate in a deploy-and-forget mode, particularly when power grid is absent and the use of rechargeable batteries is unattractive due to their limited lifetime and maintenance requirements.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} electromagnetic torque ripple and copper losses reduction in (non-sinusoidal or trapezoidal) surface-mount permanent magnet synchronous machines (SM-PMSM). The method {{is based on an}} extension of classical dq transformation that makes it possible to write a vectorial model for this kind of machine (with a non-sinusoidal back-EMF waveform). This model is obtained by the application of that transformation in the classical machine per-phase model. That transformation can be applied to machines that have any type of back-EMF waveform, and not only trapezoidal or square-wave back-EMF waveforms. Implementation results are shown for an <b>electrical</b> <b>converter,</b> using the proposed vectorial model, feeding a non-sinusoidal synchronous machine (brushless DC motor). They show that the use of this vectorial mode is a way to achieve improvements in the performance of this kind of machine, considering the electromagnetic torque ripple and copper losses, if compared to a drive system that employs a classical six-step mode as a converter.

Torque control of associate induction motor (IM) supported DTC strategy is a developed and a comprehensive study which is made during this project. Direct torque management is that the 1 st technology to regulate the important control variables of torque and flux. This methodology makes the rotor more accurate and quick management, high dynamic speed response and easy to regulate. The reference value may be calculated by the flux and torsion estimation and conjointly motor parameters. With the joint progress of numerical electronics and power electronics, it's potential nowadays to subsume the axis management with variable speed in applications involving low power.

This theme provides excellent regulation properties without using rotational speed feedback. During this control theme the electro- magnetic torque and mechanical device (stator) flux magnitude are calculable with solely mechanical device voltages and currents and this estimation doesn't rely upon motor parameters apart from the mechanical device (stator) resistance. In this thesis, typical DTC theme has been delineated. The induction motor (IM) has been simulated in stationary d-q arrangement and its free running acceleration characteristics are drawn.
