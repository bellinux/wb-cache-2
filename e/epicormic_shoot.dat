40|$|Patterns of shoot {{growth and}} {{branching}} were studied over two growing seasons in rooted cuttings collected from both epicomric shoots and seedlings of Betula pendula Roth. <b>Epicormic</b> <b>shoots</b> were induced to sprout on stumps and small logs of 5 -, IO- and 30. year-old trees. The use of <b>epicormic</b> <b>shoots</b> enhanced the rooting capacity of stem cuttings collected from these shoots {{but did not}} appear to reverse the process of maturation. In this study, maturation was based on characteristics typical of mature trees but not necessarily those of the mother plant, because {{it was not possible to}} root cuttings, for comparison, from 5 -, lo- and 30 -year-old ortets, other than from <b>epicormic</b> <b>shoots.</b> There was evidence of the persistence of mature characteristics through an increase in shoot plagiotropism with increasing ortet age. Rooted cuttings from both seedlings and <b>epicormic</b> <b>shoots,</b> however, assumed an increasingly orthotropic habit with a smaller shoot angle at the end of the first growing season than at the beginning and this continued into the second growing season. Other indications of maturation, such as delayed bud flushing and the incidence of flowering with increasing ortet age, were also evident in rooted cuttings from <b>epicormic</b> <b>shoots.</b> There was a clear difference in branching habit depending on cutting source. Rooted cuttings derived from <b>epicormic</b> <b>shoots</b> produced nearly twice as many lateral branches compared with rooted cuttings collected from seedlings, but this was not an effect of maturation.

40|$|Although {{previous}} studies have shown stand thinning increases oak wood quality defects due to epicormic branch development, thinning failed in experiments at three different sites to stimulate epicormic bud emergence or later growth in either the first, second or third years. This was in spite of much higher irradiances beneath the thinned canopies, which transmitted 73 per cent more light than the unthinned stand during the summer months. Irradiances beneath the thinned stands were increased by only 13 per cent in the period during the spring when the epicormic shoots emerged from the bole of the trees, preceding expansion of the leaf canopy. When, using artificial shading, the intensity of light incident on the bole of trees in a thinned stand was reduced by 80 per cent, without affecting bark tempertures, the numbers of epicormic shoots which emerged {{was similar to that}} on unshaded trees. <b>Epicormic</b> <b>shoot</b> emergence from the boles of thinned trees was completely prevented by excluding light from the bole with aluminium foil, which also reduced bark temperatures. When the foil was substituted by black polythene, which raised bark temperatures, the inhibition of <b>epicormic</b> <b>shoot</b> emergence was only 88 per cent. These results indicate that <b>epicormic</b> <b>shoot</b> emergence is not stimulated by increased exposure of the epicormic buds to light in thinned stands, and that light is not normally a major factor controlling epicormic bud emergence. The decrease in wood quality associated with epicormic shoots produced by thinned stands appears on this evidence {{to be the result of}} a long term promotion of epicormic branch growth and longevity.

40|$|Context While past {{studies on}} epicormics in oak (Quercus sp.) {{have focused on the}} effect of {{thinning}} on <b>epicormic</b> <b>shoots</b> emergence, the consequences of this emergence on the epicormic ontogeny and future wood quality have rarely been asked. Aims This paper aims to quantifying the relationship between past emergence and current composition of epicormics. Methods Three thinning experiments with Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. or Quercus robur L. were investigated. <b>Epicormic</b> <b>shoots</b> were regularly tallied and epicormic composition recorded recently. Some logs were scanned using X-ray computed tomography (CT). Results Past tallies on both species were mainly and positively related to the current frequency of bud clusters and burls. This was due to the production of buds by <b>epicormic</b> <b>shoots</b> for only certain trees, as evidenced by CT, and mainly to correlated numbers of current <b>epicormic</b> <b>shoots,</b> bud clusters and burls, all originating from a past common set of buds and bud clusters. Conclusion The important tree effect on both species suggests that oak silviculture can be optimized by the early selection of crop trees with few epicormics and/or eventually a first and heavy thinning that helps in spotting remaining individuals being prone to the development of multiple epicormics...|$|R
40|$|The {{physiology}} of epicormic bud development in Quercus robur was studied by recording {{the effect of}} partial notch girdles applied at different dates, {{in the spring and}} summer of 1985, on <b>epicormic</b> <b>shoot</b> emergence in stands of thinned and unthinned trees. The girdles were applied singly or in tandem pairs one above the other. In one experiment they were applied in combination with the synthetic auxin 1 -napthaleneacetic acid (NAA) or were replaced by treatment with 2, 3, 5 -triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA), an inhibitor of auxin transport. Thinning had no consistent effect on the numbers of epicormic shoots emerging, only on their later vigour, and did not consistently affect the response to girdling or the growth regulator treatments. <b>Epicormic</b> <b>shoot</b> emergence was stimulated only by girdling treatments applied in April and May, and not in June or August, indicating that the epicormic buds enter dormancy early in the season. The pattern of responses to the single and tandem girdles was consistent with a suppression of the buds in the spring by a basipetally-transported inhibitor, from the inhibitory effect of NAA observed, probably auxin. The development of the buds was not controlled by an acropetally-transported promoter whose supply could be interrupted by the girdling treatments...|$|E
30|$|Epicormic shoots {{arise from}} buds that {{otherwise}} remain suppressed in the phloem.

(Franco) var. menziesii) trees. Specific needle area decreased with increasing needle age. The magnitude and rate of change in SNA with needle age were greatest for lower-crown branches, and decreased toward the middle- and upper-crown branches. For all branches, {{there was no difference}} between regular and epicormic shoots in the rela-tionship between SNA and needle age. Specific needle area de-creased with increasing distance from branch base, and this relationship was significant for the majority of needle age classes of the upper- and middle-crown branches. In the lower-crown branches, SNA did not vary with distance from branch base for the majority of needle age classes. For all branches, {{there was no difference between}} regular and epicormic shoots in the relationship between SNA and distance from branch base for the majority of needle age classes. These results indi-cate that renewal of foliage by <b>epicormic</b> <b>shoot</b> production maintains needle quality. Branch SNA increased linearly with decreasing height in the crown at a mean rate of 0. 951 ± 0. 110 cm 2 g– 1 per vertical meter. Total needle area of branches was estimated from total needle dry weight taking into account within-branch variation in SNA. Analyses of allometric rela-tionships between branch size and foliage amount (needle area and needle dry weight) showed that branch length was a better predictor of foliage amount than branch diameter for old Douglas-fir trees. Total needle dry weight and needle area of the sample trees, estimated from branch length and branch height and taking into account vertical within-crown variation in branch SNA, ranged from 42. 4 to 154. 2 kg and from 246. 2 to 816. 0 m 2 per tree, respectively...|$|E

The plot is situated on a plateau with mesotrofic soil in a beech-oak forest vegetation zone at an altitude of 410 [*]m above sea level. Tree responses were monitored using precise girth measurements. During the first year after the release, the basal area increment showed a positive correlation with only the tree diameter.

40|$|The Forestier {{silvicultural}} systems {{trial was}} established {{over the period}} 1987 to 1989 and was designed to evaluate a variety of silvicultural systems in wet eucalypt forests. Treatments tested included clearfelling and sowing, with and without burning; harvesting of small gaps (group selection) of approximately 100 m diameter, with and without burning; and partial logging, which involved thinning of the overstorey. Successful regeneration was achieved only in the coupes that were clearfelled, burnt and sown. Stocking levels were adequate in the partially logged treatments shortly after sowing but declined in subsequent years {{and the result was}} poor by age five. Regeneration in all other treatments was unsuccessful. The ultimate failure of the regeneration within the alternative treatments is attributed to the intense browsing pressure which is thought to have followed the harvesting. Partial logging resulted in a noticeable increase in the growth rate of the retained trees in those treatments where between three quarters and one half of the trees were removed. However, thinning also resulted in a major proliferation of <b>epicormic</b> <b>shoot</b> development on the boles of the retained stems.

Epicormic branches can be removed without compromising tree growth. •ContextThe formation of epicormic shoots is often observed following pruning treatments, but {{their role in the}} overall tree growth is unknown. •AimsThe objectives of this study were to examine how pruning intensity and season affect the production of epicormic branches and how their presence (or removal) affects tree growth and total non-structural carbohydrate reserves in the roots. •MethodsTrees from four hybrid poplar clones were pruned in fall, spring, and summer at two intensities 1 / 3 and 2 / 3 of the crown length and an unpruned control. Produced epicormic branches were removed from half the trees. •ResultsPruning intensity and season were the most important factors affecting the number and biomass of epicormic shoots while clone was not. Pruning 1 / 3 crown length in summer reduced the emergence of epicormic shoots compared to 2 / 3 and spring or fall pruning. Two years after pruning, the removal of epicormic shoots did not affect height or diameter at breast height of trees, and their presence did not restore root total non-structural carbohydrates reserves to unpruned levels. •ConclusionWe concluded that pruning should be done in summer at 1 / 3 of the crown length to reduce <b>epicormic</b> <b>shoot</b> formation and to avoid decreases in stem growth.

40|$|International audienceOne {{definition}} of horticulture is "the art of cultivating garden plants" and pruning is a horticultural practice that is traditionally approached {{as more of}} an art than a science. This is {{largely because of the}} complexity of tree growth and development and a lack of general understanding and appreciation about the processes involved in governing shoot and tree growth and development. However recent tree architectural studies have provided systematic analyses of the shoot growth and statistical and dynamic simulation models have been developed that predict tree development and responses to pruning based on scientific concepts. These concepts include apical dominance (and its subcomponents; correlative inhibition, apical control and shoot epinasty); prolepsis and syllepsis; preformation and neoformation; <b>epicormic</b> <b>shoot</b> formation and plastochron (leaf emergence rates). In this paper we will discuss how many of these concepts can be combined with hidden semi-Markov chain models of shoot bud fates and a simulation model of source-sink interactions in peach trees (L-PEACH) to understand and predict natural development of peach trees and their responses to pruning. The results of these modeling efforts help explain the architectural and physiological basis of several common, empirically-based pruning systems used in California. These concepts also provide an understanding of the limitations of relying primarily on the use of pruning to control size of trees growing on commonly used invigorating rootstocks. This research demonstrates how computer simulation modeling can be used to test and analyze interactions between environmental factors and management practices in determining patterns of tree growth and development...|$|E
40|$|Our {{knowledge}} about oak epicormics has considerably increased in recent years, particularly {{thanks to the}} external recording of all epicormic types (suppressed buds, bud clusters, sprouts, picots and burls) and to internal observations made using X-ray computed tomography (CT). Several stages of epicormic ontogeny have been identified. The aims {{of this study were}} to provide the quantification of oak epicormic ontogeny and to identify the relationships between epicormics present near the trunk pith and epicormics present at the surface of the bark, based on data recovered from X-ray CT scanning. One to three 1 -m-long logs per tree were recovered from crop trees felled in five experimental stands located in four forests in northern France. The manual interpretation of the images provided by X-ray CT makes it possible to identify the origin and fate of every rameal trace, i. e., branch knot, <b>epicormic</b> <b>shoot</b> or trace of suppressed buds. The fate of branches and the origin and the fate of suppressed buds and sprouts were quantified. A strong relationship between the number of epicormics at the surface of the bark and the number of epicormics near the pith was highlighted. This could result in important silvicultural recommendations in terms of the necessary early selection of crop trees with the lowest number of epicormics possible, especially suppressed buds. From a broader ecological point of view, this paves the way {{to a better understanding of}} the variability of the sprouting response induced by disturbances, which is assumed to develop at an early stage in the tree life.

40|$|Background and Aims There is {{increasing}} evidence that suppressed bud burst and thus <b>epicormic</b> <b>shoot</b> emergence (sprouting) {{are controlled by}} water-carbohydrate supplies to entire trees and buds. This direct evidence is still lacking for oak. In other respects, recent studies focused on sessile oak, Quercus petraea, have confirmed the important constraints of sprouting by epicormic ontogeny. The main objective {{of this paper was}} thus to provide provisional confirmation of the water-carbohydrate control and direct evidence of the ontogenic constraints by bringing together results already published in separate studies on water status and distribution of carbohydrates, and on accompanying vegetation and epicormics, which also quantify epicormic ontogeny. Methods This paper analyses results gained from a sessile oak experiment in which part of the site was free from fairly tall, dense accompanying vegetation. This experiment was initially focused on stand water status and more recently on the carbohydrate distribution of dominant trees. External observations of the epicormic composition and internal observations with X-ray computer tomography were undertaken on 60 and six trees, respectively. Key Results Sprouting was more intense in the part of the stand free from accompanying vegetation and on upper trunk segments. A clear effect of epicormic ontogeny was demonstrated as well: the more epicormics a trunk segment bears, the more chances it had to bear sprouts. Conclusions These results indirectly infer water-carbohydrate control and show direct evidence of constraints by epicormic ontogeny. These results have far-reaching consequences related to the quantification of all functions fulfilled by any type of epicormic structure in any part of the tree...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2000 Old-growth Pseudotsuga-Tsuga {{forests of}} the western Cascade Range are {{characterized}} by presence of large, old trees of Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesii. Colonizing soon after a stand-replacing disturbance, P. menziesii is a long-lived pioneer species that persists in these forests for centuries. In this study of canopy dynamics of a 450 -year-old Pseudotsuga-Tsuga forest, four canopy processes were found {{to contribute to the}} long-term coexistence of P. menziesii with late-successional species and to long-term survival of individual trees. (1) Vertical stratification: P. menziesii dominates the upper-most part of the canopy, comprising nearly 70 % of trees above 50 m in height. Measurement and projection of current height-growth patterns indicate that this dominance will continue for at least another century. (2) Decreasing crown competition in the upper canopy: Height growth and crown expansion culminate in large trees of all species, indicating that crown competition decreases with increasing tree size. This allows the existing large trees of different species to coexist in the upper canopy. (3) Morphological acclimation: Old-growth P. menziesii have deep crowns with low branch density, and symmetric branching pattern that result in efficient shoot and foliage display. In comparison to young and mature trees, old-growth P. menziesii have marked differences in crown form and branching pattern. Morphological plasticity and acclimation enable P. menziesii to persist into later stages of succession. (4) Crown maintenance: <b>Epicormic</b> <b>shoot</b> production in old-growth P. menziesii results in adaptive reiteration of shoot cluster units, subbranch units, and entire branches. This is an important mechanism for maintaining productivity of the established crown after height growth and crown expansion have culminated, and contributes to prolonging individual tree life-span. Architectural characteristics generally associated with early-successional species do not apply to old-growth P. menziesii. Characteristics associated with persistence of P. menziesii may be linked with the long-term community, dynamic and disturbance regime of this region. Architectural characteristics of trees change during their development, and various aspects of the species' ecology as well as its role in community dynamics need to be considered to understand the ecological significance of tree architecture...|$|E
40|$|Property {{management}} {{is an important}} aspect in sustaining the Earth’s ecosystems. Anthropogenic changes to the planet have made conservation important in maintaining species abundance and diversity as well as limit damages to sensitive ecosystems. Invasive species have become a standard, consistent problem in managed ecosystems. Such species often invade into disturbed areas, which commonly {{are a result of}} restoration or other management activities. In dredging open water bodies at Eagle Marsh Nature Preserve (Allen County, IN), artificial mounds were constructed with the soil removed. This movement of soil created a disturbance which facilitated for the recruitment and colonization of invasive species. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify the effectiveness of transferring a native seed bank in a mesic prairie to the artificial mounds as a method of controlling invasive species. The native seed bank in the mesic prairie would be lost due to additional management. This study was conducted with greenhouse and field experimentation. Soil samples containing the seed bank were moved to a greenhouse to quantify plant emergence following different intact and mixed soil treatments. All emerging plant species were identified and counted. All treatment methods contained a high diversity of native species and a low diversity of invasive species with the exception of the seed bank soil mixed with soil from the mounds. The mound mixed soil contained a higher diversity of invasive species than other treatments. A plant survey of the mounds was conducted in July 2014. In October 2014, 960 m 2 of soil was transferred from the donor site to the mounds. A post-move survey conducted in July 2015 indicated the native species diversity increased while the diversity of invasive species decreased. Soil transfer as a management strategy was appropriate in this situation where a large native seed bank in a donor region existed. By moving soil from one location to another, we were able to promote native plant establishment and reduce invasive species emergence. While soil transfer is effective, other management strategies may not have the same results. Callery pear (Pyrus calleryana) is an invasive tree introduced to North America as an ornamental from southwest Asia. It easily invades disturbed areas, causing a disruption to mid- to late-successional species establishment. The purpose of this study was to assess Callery pear demographics in a managed prairie and quantify the effects of a prescribed fire management strategy on Callery pear density and recruitment. This study was conducted at Arrowhead Prairie (Allen County, IN), managed by Little River Wetlands Project (LRWP). Before 2009, Arrowhead Prairie was primarily used for agriculture. Following LRWP acquisition, the property has undergone active management including native plant seeding and prescribed fire. The prairie was divided into a north and south section using a historic ditch, with the south section burned in April 2014 and the north section burned in May 2015. Bare seeds, fruit, first-year seedlings, and second-year seedlings were also burned in a separate controlled experiment. Fire in both years top killed Callery pear individuals, with 100 % of surveyed trees producing epicormic shoots and 83 % producing more than one epicormic sprout. First-year seedlings exposed to the fire had a 3 % resprout rate while all seconds-year seedlings resprouted. In contrast, 13 % of individuals at Arrowhead Prairie had epicormic shoots without fire. Trees were significantly shorter post-burn than prior to the burn; however, root collar diameter was not different, suggesting that resources were used in primary growth. While fire did reduce stem height, it did increase the number of stems occurring within the burned section due to epicormic sprouting. Root stored reserves provided necessary energy to produce numerous sprouts by the majority of pear trees, although no trees produced flowers during the duration of the study. Plant age likely plays an important role in response to fire, with seeds and fruits succumbing. However, older seedlings may survive with increased <b>epicormic</b> <b>shoot</b> production. Multiple techniques combined with relevant studies allows for land managers to make appropriate decisions in terms of management. Although many of these techniques are not universal, a wide range of researched techniques provides multiple avenues of approach when managing a parcel of land. ...|$|E
