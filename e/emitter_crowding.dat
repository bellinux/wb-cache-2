40|$|The main {{examined}} {{value in}} an experiment performed on moderately loaded voltage regulators was the serial pnp transistor’s minimum dropout voltage, followed by the data on the base current and forward emitter current gain. Minimum dropout voltage decreased by up to 12 %, while the measured values of the forward emitter current gain decreased by 20 - 40 % after the absorption of a total ionizing dose of 500 Gy. The oxide trapped charge increased the radiation tolerance of the serial lateral pnp transistor owing to the suppression of interface trap formation above the base area. Current flow through the serial transistor of the voltage regulator had an influence on the decrease in the power pnp transistor’s forward emitter current gain. Due to the operation with a moderate load of 100 mA, loss of emitter injection efficiency was {{not as important as}} during the operation with high current density, thus eliminating the negative influence of <b>emitter</b> <b>crowding</b> on the radiation hardness of the voltage regulator. For a moderate load, gain in the negative feedback reaction was enough to keep output voltage in the anticipated range. Only information procured from tests of the minimum dropout voltage on the moderately loaded voltage regulators were not sufficient for unequivocal determination of the examined integrated circuit’s radiation hardness.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve thermal {{stability}} and extend their safe operation region, epitaxial emitter ballasting resistors have been incorporated into power heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs). In this report, we show that this lightly doped layer not only can function as ballasting resistors used in multi-finger power HBT cells, but also can reduce the <b>emitter</b> current <b>crowding</b> effect which is an important limitation in bipolar transistors operating at high emitter current densities.

40|$|The {{potential}} of {{an array of}} imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes to detect gamma-ray sources in complex regions has been investigated. The basic characteristics of the gamma-ray instrument have been parametrized using simple analytic representations. In addition to the ideal (Gaussian form) point spread function (PSF), the impact of more realistic non-Gaussian PSFs with tails has been considered. Simulations of isolated point-like and extended sources {{have been used as}} a benchmark to test and understand the response of the instrument. The capability of the instrument to resolve multiple sources has been analyzed and the corresponding instrument sensitivities calculated. The results are of particular interest for weak gamma-ray <b>emitters</b> located in <b>crowded</b> regions of the Galactic plane, where the chance of clustering of two or more gamma-ray sources within 1 degree is high.
