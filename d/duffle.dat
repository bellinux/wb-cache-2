25|$|Police interviewed Bishop's husband, James Anderson, {{after it}} was {{determined}} that she had called him to pick her up after the shooting; they did not charge him with a crime. In addition, a neighbor revealed, in later interviews, that he saw the couple leaving their home with <b>duffle</b> bags on Friday afternoon, (revealed to be martial arts bags) prior to the shooting. Anderson revealed that his wife had borrowed the gun used in the shooting, and that he had escorted her to an indoor shooting range in the weeks prior to the incident.|$|E
25|$|As {{the series}} progresses, Creek {{gradually}} changes from an asocial anorak {{to a man}} {{with a great deal of}} wit and charm. This helps to fuel the romantic thread between him and Maddy. Jonathan's trademark <b>duffle</b> coat worn in the first series was actually Alan Davies' own coat that he wore to the auditions; it helped him win the role, as the writer and producers thought it suited the character. After the first series, Jonathan's coat was supplied by the wardrobe department. Davies kept the original at his home, and wore it again for the 2009 New Year's special.|$|E

500|$|During {{its first}} years, the daily Winnie Winkle evolved from simple gags to more complex humorous situations. A new {{character}} {{was introduced in}} the form of Perry, a little boy from the backstreets, whom the Winkles adopted in 1922. The focus of the Sunday pages then shifted to the adventures of Perry at home, school and on the streets. Although compelled to wear a <b>duffle</b> coat and fancy clothes, he continued to frequent his old neighborhood. The local gang, the Rinkydinks, in contrast, still wore torn and patchy clothing, and were regarded by Winnie as [...] "loafers." [...] One member of the Rinkydinks was the dunce, Denny Dimwit, who popularized the catch phrase, [...] "Youse is a good boy, Denny." ...|$|E
500|$|Harry {{received}} a National Diploma in design {{while at the}} Liverpool Art College {{and became the first}} student in the new Graphic Design course, eventually winning a Senior City Art Scholarship. Harry maintained that students at art college should be bohemian in their thoughts and actions and not like the [...] "dilettantes and dabblers", whom Harry disapproved of for wearing <b>duffle</b> coats and turtle neck sweaters. One of the college's artists and teachers, Arthur Ballard, later stated that Harry and Sutcliffe both overshadowed Lennon at college, explaining that they were both [...] "extremely well educated, and very eager for information". Harry organised a students' film society, where he showed Orphee, by Jean Cocteau and Salvador Dalí, and Luis Buñuel's, L'Age d'Or.|$|E
500|$|The {{murder of}} Suzanne Capper was {{committed}} in Greater Manchester, England in December 1992. Sixteen-year-old Suzanne Jane Capper died in Withington Hospital on 18 December 1992, from multiple organ failure arising from eighty percent burns {{after she was}} deliberately set on fire on 14 December. Before her death, Capper related that she had previously been kidnapped and kept prisoner for seven days at a house in Moston, Manchester, where she was beaten and tortured. She {{was taken from the}} house by car, driven into the countryside and forced out of the car virtually naked into a wood at Werneth Low where petrol was poured over her and she was set alight. The torture and murder arose from the [...] "avenging [...] trivial grievances: a sexual insult, infection with pubic lice and the loss of a pink <b>duffle</b> coat." ...|$|E
500|$|At trial, {{it emerged}} that Capper had been kidnapped for [...] "insubstantial, even trivial" [...] reasons: Jean Powell claimed that Capper {{had tried to}} persuade her to sleep with a man for money; McNeilly and Dudson had {{contracted}} pubic lice which they believed were from a bed that Capper had also used; and McNeilly believed that she had taken a pink <b>duffle</b> coat that belonged to her. In November 1992, when Dudson had contracted pubic lice and had his pubic hair shaved, McNeilly told him she {{thought that he had}} caught them from Capper. Dudson believed otherwise, and said later: [...] "I told Jean [...] I thought I got them from Bernie [...]" [...] On 7 December 1992, Capper was lured to Jean Powell's home, where Glyn Powell and Dudson were already waiting. She was grabbed as soon as she arrived and held down while Glyn Powell shaved her head and her eyebrows and then made her clean up the hair and place it in a bin. Then he placed a plastic bag over her head and walked round her while hitting her on the head. She was then kicked by Jean Powell and McNeilly as she lay curled up on the floor and both women took turns beating her with a three-foot-long (1 m) wooden instrument and a belt. She was then taken to the bathroom and forced to shave off her own pubic hair as [...] "ritual humiliation in revenge for having caused, as they claimed, Dudson and McNeilly themselves to be shaved." [...] Afterwards Jean Powell locked her in a cupboard overnight. The following morning she was taken upstairs and locked in another cupboard. On 8 December she was transferred to McNeilly's house because of concern that Powell and McNeilly's six children were disturbed by Capper's crying. There she was tied spreadeagle to an upturned bed with electrical flex in a downstairs back room.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{also noted}} the unusual {{situation}} in that [...] "a gang was involved and that two females were the sadistic leaders." [...] Following the convictions of Powell and McNeilly, there was wider press speculation about [...] "girl gangs" [...] {{and the rise}} in violent crime committed by young women, and [...] "the probation service and ex-offender organisations found themselves bombarded with requests from journalists seeking out case histories to illustrate this apparent explosion of LA-style girl-gang culture {{on the streets of}} Britain." [...] Mary Barnish, a senior probation officer at the Inner London Probation Service Women's Centre, dismissed the notion, saying: [...] "One woman does something somewhere and immediately there's a great moral panic. People think there's an epidemic of it." [...] However, statistics and research produced by the National Association of Probation Officers did show [...] "an {{increase in the number of}} women jailed for offences involving violence." [...] The association's assistant general secretary Harry Fletcher said that, like the women involved in the Capper murder, the group is [...] "characterised by neglect, personal abuse, drug or alcohol abuse and low self-esteem. Many have themselves been the victim of violence. The problem needs help rather than incarceration." [...] In one of the [...] "starkest signs of change" [...] there was evidence that [...] "in the 15—17 age group, girls are more likely to take pleasure in violence than boys, an indication we may face far more female violence in the future as these girls grow up." [...] Despite the focus on the female perpetrators around the time of the crime and trial Davis pointed out that, in cases like this which involved female and male sadists, [...] "the female's role is invariably forgotten over time. This was apparent when Dudson's appeals were reported in the national press. Manchester newspapers named all of the killers involved, but most less-localised reports simply referred to the 'violent gang' he belonged to, and it probably wouldn't have occurred to newer readers that this gang included two merciless female sadists who thought that an allegedly stolen <b>duffle</b> coat was an excuse to torture someone to death." ...|$|E
2500|$|Others {{who were}} tried {{for the part}} {{included}} Nigel Planer (who would later guest star) and Angus Deayton (who had previously worked with Renwick and director Susan Belbin on One Foot in the Grave). Almost a dozen actors were considered before Susan Belbin saw Alan Davies during a rehearsal for a sitcom. Davies was invited round to talk to Renwick and [...] "turned up in his <b>duffle</b> coat with straggly hair and a broad grin [...] was self-evidently the closest match yet to Creek as we had always seen him".|$|E
2500|$|In school, Jackson {{expressed}} {{no interest}} in sports. His classmates also remember him wearing a <b>duffle</b> coat with [...] "an obsession verging on religious". He had no formal training in film-making, but learned about editing, special effects and make-up largely through his own trial and error. As a young adult, Jackson discovered the work of author J. R. R. Tolkien after watching The Lord of the Rings (1978), an animated film by Ralph Bakshi that was a part-adaptation of Tolkien's fantasy trilogy. When he was 16 years old, Jackson left school and began working full-time as a photo-engraver for a Wellington newspaper, The Evening Post. For the seven years he worked there, Jackson lived {{at home with his}} parents so he could save as much money as possible to spend on film equipment. After two years of work Jackson bought a 16 mm camera, and began shooting a film that later became Bad Taste.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the annual}} Saturday Book {{recorded}} in 1956 {{a view that}} [...] "London's now nothing but flash coffee bars, with teddies and little bits of girls in jeans", the [...] "Edwardian" [...] ("teddy boy") look of the times did not coincide with Bohemian tastes. For women, {{the legacy of the}} [...] "New Look" [...] was still apparent, although hemlines had generally risen as, as one journalist put it in 1963, [...] "photographs of those first bold bearers of the New Look make them seem strangely lost and bewildered, as though they had mistaken their cue and come on stage fifty years late". The Bohemian foci during this period were the jazz clubs and espresso bars of Soho and Fitzrovia. Their habitués usually wore polo necks; {{in the words of one}} social historian, “thousands of pale, duffel-coat-clad students were hunched in coffee bars over their copies of Jean-Paul Sartre and Jack Kerouac”. Various public houses and clubs also catered for Bohemian tastes, notably the Colony Room Club in Soho, opened in 1948 by Muriel Belcher, a lesbian from Birmingham. As with the literary phenomenon of the so-called [...] "Angry Young Men" [...] from 1956 onwards, the image was more a male, than a female, one. However, when the singer Alma Cogan wished to mark her success by buying mink coats for her mother and sister, the actress Sandra Caron, the latter asked for a duffel-coat instead because she wanted to be regarded as a serious actress and [...] "a sort of a beatnik". In 1960 the future author Jacqueline Wilson, who, as a teenager, lived in Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, captured this look after spotting two acquaintances in a record shop [...] "in turquoise <b>duffle</b> coats, extremely tight jeans and cha-cha shoes being cuddled by a group of horrible spotty teddy boys".|$|E

60|$|The water froze {{every night}} in our basins, {{although}} the stove was kept at nearly a red heat all day, and pretty warm all night; and our out-of-door costume was changed from jackets and shooting-coats to thick leather capotes, fur caps, <b>duffle</b> socks, and moccasins.|$|E
60|$|This was {{the first}} time he had given this {{particular}} order, and the men guffawed or grinned as they hauled the great, clumsy prairie-schooners into a circle. The oxen were unhitched; the camp <b>duffle</b> piled out; the ring of axes broke the stillness; fires were started.|$|E
6000|$|The {{man with}} the leveled shot-gun drawled, [...] "I'm the deputy sheriff for this {{locality}} and I'll give you dirty bums just five minutes to pick up your <b>duffle</b> and git out, and keep a-going. I guess we don't need you around here. You been robbing every hen-roost for ten miles. Now step lively, and no funny business." ...|$|E
6000|$|Oh! what's the matter? what's the matter? [...] What is't that ails young Harry Gill? [...] That evermore {{his teeth}} they chatter, [...] Chatter, chatter, chatter still!

60|$|Only {{two of the}} Indians {{remained}} with them to help them over their difficulties--namely, Okematan and Kateegoose, with their respective squaws. These last were invaluable as the makers of moccasins and <b>duffle</b> socks and leathern coats, without which existence in such a climate would have been impossible. They also imparted their knowledge in such matters to the squaws of the white men.|$|E
60|$|Have seen {{dispatch}} from General Grant {{about your}} loss at Rogersville. Per contra, {{about the same}} time, Averell and <b>Duffle</b> got considerable advantage of the enemy at and about Lewisburg, Virginia: and on Saturday, the seventh, Meade drove the enemy from Rappahannock Station and Kelly's Ford, capturing eight battle-flags, four guns, and over 1800 prisoners, with very little loss to himself. Let me hear from you.|$|E
60|$|All their <b>duffle</b> and the {{supplies}} which Pat was taking in were loaded on the toboggan, {{and to this}} Pat had rigged a sort of harness so that two walking single file could drag it. This relieved them of packs. Walter and Hal each carried his rifle on the chance of picking up a rabbit on the way. The snow-shoes were slung over their backs, Pat explaining that for a time they would follow a broken out lumber trail {{and it would be}} easier walking without the shoes than on them.|$|E
60|$|Sparrer was of {{just the}} type to win {{immediate}} favor with the rough, big-hearted lumber-jacks, and they made him feel at home at once. They vied {{with one another in}} showing him things of interest, and his comments, colored with the slang of the city streets, afforded them no end of amusement. So it was with regret on all sides that at break of the following day the boys put their <b>duffle</b> on the big sled used for hauling in supplies and followed it themselves. Pat went with them to see them off at the train.|$|E
60|$|Sparrer, {{having no}} axe, but a stout Scout knife, volunteered {{to cut the}} alder saplings while Hal and Walter {{attended}} to {{the holes in the}} ice. Hal was radiant. This {{was one of the things}} he had counted on, and he had brought from New York a dozen type, as the modern tip-ups for fishing through the ice are called. But when they had started out that morning he had not dreamed that he would have a chance to use them on a snow-shoe trip, and so they were neatly rolled in his <b>duffle</b> bag at the camp.|$|E
60|$|They {{sat down}} a little apart from the lama, and, after {{listening}} awhile, passed round a water-pipe whose receiver was an old Day and Martin blacking-bottle. The glow of the red charcoal as it went {{from hand to hand}} lit up the narrow, blinking eyes, the high Chinese cheek-bones, and the bull-throats that melted away into the dark <b>duffle</b> folds round the shoulders. They looked like kobolds from some magic mine--gnomes of the hills in conclave. And while they talked, the voices of the snow-waters round them diminished one by one as the night-frost choked and clogged the runnels.|$|E
60|$|The Indian, whose horned cap and person {{were well}} {{powdered}} with snow, stepped slowly over the threshold, extending {{his hand to}} the Highlander's grasp, and looking cautiously round with rolling black eyes, as if he half expected a dynamite explosion to follow his entrance. His garments bore evidence of rough usage. Holes in his moccasins permitted portions of the <b>duffle</b> socks underneath to wander out. Knots on his snow-shoe lines and netting told of a long rough journey, and the soiled, greasy condition of his leathern capote spoke of its having been much used not only as a garment by day but as a shirt by night.|$|E
60|$|Into its {{inviting}} and capacious depths he deposited his inanimate burden, {{and only}} then did he become aware of two pairs of eyes, which were fixed upon him with very different expression. A buxom wench in ample wide kirtle of striped <b>duffle,</b> had been busy when he entered in spreading clean linen sheets upon the narrow little bed built in the panelling of the room. From under her quaint winged cap of starched lace a pair of very round eyes, blue as the Ryn, peeped in naïve undisguised admiration on the intruder, whilst from beneath her disordered coif Maria threw glances of deadly fury upon him.|$|E
6000|$|The others {{laughed as}} they {{followed}} Pat's example and shouldered their <b>duffle</b> to tramp the hundred yards {{up to the}} station, for {{they had been in}} the rear car. In a few minutes they were in the bare little waiting room, in the middle of which a big stove was radiating welcome heat, and exchanging greetings with the night operator, who having wired the arrival and departure of the train was preparing to go home, for {{there would be no more}} traffic for many hours. He shook hands warmly with Walter and Hal, whom he recognized at once as Woodcraft Camp boys, was introduced to Sparrer, and jollied Pat on what he was pleased to term his [...] "New York airs." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{short run}} by train to Lower Chain was quickly made, {{and the boys}} piled out, eager {{to be on their}} way. Pat had {{provided}} a stout toboggan which showed the effects of long use, and on this he deftly loaded their <b>duffle</b> and supplies, lashing them securely into place. Sparrer watched him with troubled face. Ever since the mention of skates the day before he had worried over that twelve mile trip down the lake. He knew that Upton and Harrison had brought skates, but he had none, and if he had had he couldn't have used them. He had never been on a pair in his life. Skating is not an accomplishment of the lower East Side of New York.|$|E
6000|$|Winter, {{according}} to its ancient custom, passed away; and spring, not with its genial gales and scented flowers, but with burning sun and melting snow, {{changed the face of}} nature, and broke the icy covering of Red River. <b>Duffle</b> coats vanished, {{and a few of the}} half-breed settlers doffed their fur caps and donned the [...] "bonnet rouge," [...] while the more hardy and savage contented themselves with the bonnet noir, in the shape of their own thick black hair. Carioles still continued to run, but it was merely from the force of habit, and it was evident they would soon give up in despair. Sportsmen began to think of ducks and geese, farmers of ploughs and wheat, and voyageurs to dream of rapid streams and waterfalls, and of distant voyages in light canoes.|$|E
60|$|The idea {{appealed to}} the boys, and it was finally agreed that they would {{accompany}} him to his camp the next day. It would give them a new experience {{for which they were}} eager, {{and at the same time}} eliminate the long hike back to Lower Chain. So, not without sincere regret, it must be admitted, they got their <b>duffle</b> together preparatory to an early start the next morning for the fifteen mile hike to Jim's headquarters. They turned in early, for now that the excitement was over they felt the reaction from the long strain they had been under, and the loss of sleep the night before. Jim and the warden bunked on the floor and the cabin in Smugglers' Hollow was soon wrapped in silence save for the gentle breathing of the sleepers. So ended a red letter day for at least three of the occupants.|$|E
60|$|Socrates {{with a hole}} in his head, now freshly bandaged with a bit {{of clean}} linen by the {{sympathetic}} hand of a serving maid: his hooked nose neatly washed till it shone like the pewter handle of a knife, his pointed cranium but sparsely furnished with lanky black hair peeping out above the bandage like a yellow wurzel in wrappings of paper. His arms and legs were unusually long and unusually thin, and he had long lean hands and long narrow feet, but his body was short and slightly bent forward as if under the weight of his head, which also was narrow and long. His neck was like that of a stork that has been half-plucked, it rose from out the centre of his ruffled collar with a curious undulating movement, which suggested that he could turn it right round and look at the middle of his own back. He wore a brown doublet of <b>duffle</b> and brown trunks and hose, and boots that appeared to be too big even for his huge feet.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Yonge's first list of Easter prizes {{contains}} twenty {{names of}} girls, {{and the years}} that have passed have left but few of them here. A large Bible bound in plain brown leather was the highest prize; Prayer Books, equally unornamented, New Testaments, and Psalters, being books containing only the Psalms and Matins and Evensong, were also given, and were then, perhaps, more highly valued than the dainty little coloured books every one now likes to have for Sunday. Then there were frocks, coarse straw bonnets, and sometimes pocket handkerchiefs, for these were {{not by any means}} such universal possessions as could be wished, and only came out on Sunday. As to gloves, silk handkerchiefs, parasols, muffs, or even umbrellas, the children thought them as much out of their reach as a set of pearls or diamonds, but what was worse, their outer clothing was very insufficent, seldom more than a thin cotton frock and tippet, and the grey <b>duffle</b> cloaks, which were thought a great possession, were both slight and scanty.|$|E
60|$|Pat {{insisted on}} helping Alec do up {{the dishes and}} flatly refused to allow any one else take a hand, so the others spent the time in stowing away their <b>duffle</b> and {{inspecting}} {{the interior of the}} cabin. To Sparrer it was, of course, all new and strange. As for that, it was hardly less so to Harrison and Upton. When they had last seen it it had been windowless, doorless and the roof at the rear had been but temporarily patched. Now there was a stout door. Four small windows had been fitted into the openings left for this purpose. The temporary repairs which Pat had made on the roof at the rear end had been replaced with a permanent roof. In fact, the whole roof had been put in first class shape. The side walls had been repacked with moss between the logs, the four side bunks repaired and a new one built at the back, and all filled with freshly cut balsam. The floor had been repaired. So also had the fireplace and chimney. A small cupboard and shelves had been added. On the floor were two big deerskins.|$|E
60|$|The bride-maiden's glory was theirs by right, though Ethel was an {{unsatisfactory}} {{chief for}} such as desired splendour. She protested against anything incongruous with January, or {{that could not}} be useful afterwards, and Meta took her part, laughing at the cruel stroke they were preparing for Bellairs. Ethel begged for dark silks and straw bonnets, and Flora said that she had expected to hear of brown stuff and gray <b>duffle,</b> but owned that they had better omit the ordinary muslin garb in the heart of winter. The baby bride's-maid was, at last, the chief consideration. Margaret suggested how pretty she and Blanche would look in sky-blue merino, trimmed with swan's-down. Meta was charmed with the idea, and though Ethel stuck out her shoulder-blades and poked out her head, and said she should look like the ugly duckling, she was clamorously reminded that the ugly duckling ended by being a swan, and promised that she should be allowed a bonnet of a reasonable size, trimmed with white, for Mr. Rivers's good taste could endure, as little as Dr. May's sense of propriety, the sight of a daughter without shade to her face, Ethel, finally, gave in, on being put in mind that her papa had a penchant for swan's-down, and on Margaret's promising to wear a dress of the same as theirs.|$|E
60|$|The landing-master {{having this}} day {{discharged}} the Smeaton and loaded the Hedderwick and Dickie praam-boats with nineteen stones, they were towed {{to their respective}} moorings, when Captain Wilson, in consequence of the heavy swell of sea, came in his boat to the beacon-house to consult with the writer as to the propriety of venturing the loaded praam-boats with their cargoes to the rock while so much sea was running. After some dubiety expressed on the subject, in which the ardent mind of the landing-master suggested many arguments in favour of his being able to convey the praams in perfect safety, it was acceded to. In bad weather, and especially on occasions of difficulty like the present, Mr. Wilson, who was an extremely active seaman, measuring about five feet three inches in height, of a robust habit, generally dressed himself in {{what he called a}} monkey jacket, made of thick <b>duffle</b> cloth, with a pair of Dutchman's petticoat trousers, reaching only to his knees, where they were met with a pair of long water-tight boots; with this dress, his glazed hat, and his small brass speaking-trumpet in his hand, he bade defiance to the weather. When he made his appearance in this most suitable attire for the service, his crew seemed to possess additional life, never failing to use their utmost exertions when the captain put on his storm rigging. They had this morning commenced loading the praam-boats at four o'clock, and proceeded to tow them into the eastern landing-place, which was accomplished with much dexterity, though not without the risk of being thrown, by the force of the sea, on certain projecting ledges of the rock. In such a case the loss even of a single stone would have greatly retarded the work. For the greater safety in entering the creek it was necessary to put out several warps and guy-ropes to guide the boats into its narrow and intricate entrance; and it frequently happened that the sea made a clean breach over the praams, which not only washed their decks, but completely drenched the crew in water.|$|E
