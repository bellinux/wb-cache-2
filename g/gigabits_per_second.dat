25|$|The eighty <b>gigabits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> of {{bandwidth}} each Ka band satellites offers is {{an improvement}} {{on the four}} to six <b>gigabits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> capacity available from earlier interim satellites. The satellites bounce signals from a satellite dish on the premises to an earth station, known as a 'gateway'; the gateway is then connected to a POI via a fibre backhaul. The satellite design was 'not easy', because the required coverage is about 'five per cent of the world's land mass' containing 'at least 200,000 premises' spread across 'over 7,000 kilometres' of area between Cocos Islands and Norfolk Island.|$|E
25|$|NBN Co had {{contracted}} Space Systems/Loral {{to build and}} launch two geostationary Ka band satellites in 2015 at a total cost of , each offering eighty <b>gigabits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> of bandwidth.

500|$|Originally, SvalSat used a {{combination}} of a 2 megabits per second (Mb/s) leased line, several Integrated Services Digital Network lines and a 55 Mbit/s [...] satellite Internet access via Intelsat for data transmission off the island. From 2004, the Svalbard Undersea Cable System gives two redundant fiber lines to the mainland, each providing 10 <b>gigabits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> The fiber connection is operated by Telenor. Power is supplied from Longyearbyen Power Station, In case of a power outage, the facility is equipped with an uninterruptible power supply and has a standby generator capable of supplying power for two weeks.|$|E

2500|$|From the {{implementation}} of the Svalbard Undersea Cable System in 2003 Ny-Ålesund had a twin 155 megabits per second microwave connection to Longyearbyen. Two redundant fiber pairs were laid in 2014, increasing capacity to 10 <b>gigabits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> The fiber line is owned by Uninett and cost NOK90 million to install. The very-long-baseline interferometry station at Hamnerabben is sensitive to electromagnetic radiation in certain frequencies. Thus there is enforced a [...] exclusion zone for devices transmitting at between 2.1 and 2.5GHz. The ban includes mobile telephones, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and other wireless devices. Telenor Maritim Radio operates a VHF maritime radio transmitted in Ny-Ålesund, which is remotely controlled from Bodø Radio.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prefetch}} buffer depth {{can also}} {{be thought of as}} the ratio between the core memory frequency and the IO frequency. [...] In an 8n prefetch architecture (such as DDR3), the IOs will operate 8 times faster than the memory core (each memory access results in a burst of 8 datawords on the IOs). [...] Thus a 200MHz memory core is combined with IOs that each operate eight times faster (1600 megabits per second). [...] If the memory has 16 IOs, the total read bandwidth would be 200MHz x 8 datawords/access x 16 IOs = 25.6 <b>gigabits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (Gbit/s), or 3.2 gigabytes per second (GB/s). [...] Modules with multiple DRAM chips can provide correspondingly higher bandwidth.|$|E
2500|$|The current Mac {{product family}} uses Intel x86-64 processors. Apple {{introduced}} an emulator {{during the transition}} from PowerPC chips (called Rosetta), {{much as it did}} during the transition from Motorola 68000 architecture a decade earlier. The Macintosh is the only mainstream computer platform to have successfully transitioned to a new CPU architecture, and has done so twice. All current Mac models ship with at least 8GB of RAM as standard other than the 1.4GHz Mac Mini, MacBook Pro (without Retina Display), and MacBook Air. Current Mac computers use ATI/AMD Radeon or Nvidia GeForce graphics cards as well as Intel graphics built into the main CPU. All current Macs (except for the MacBook Pro without Retina Display) do not ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual-function DVD/CD burner. Apple refers to this as a SuperDrive. Current Macs include two standard data transfer ports: USB and Thunderbolt (except for the Retina MacBook, which only has a USB-C port and headphone port). MacBook Pro, iMac, MacBook Air, and Mac Mini computers now also feature the [...] "Thunderbolt" [...] port, which Apple says can transfer data at speeds up to 10 <b>gigabits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> [...] USB was introduced in the 1998 iMac G3 and is ubiquitous today, while FireWire was mainly reserved for high-performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras. Starting with the then-new iMac G5, released in October 2005, Apple started to include built-in iSight cameras on appropriate models, and a media center interface called Front Row that can be operated by an Apple Remote or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer. Front Row has been discontinued as of 2011, however, and the Apple Remote is no longer bundled with new Macs.|$|E
