40|$|We analyze looping of thin charged elastic {{filaments}} under applied torques and end forces, {{using the}} solution of linear elasticity theory equations. In application to DNA, we account for its polyelectrolyte character and charge renormalization, calculating <b>electrostatic</b> energies <b>stored</b> in the loops. We argue that the standard theory of electrostatic persistence is only valid when the loop's radius of curvature and close-contact distance are {{much larger than the}} Debye screening length. We predict that larger twist rates are required to trigger looping of charged rods as compared with neutral ones. We then analyze loop shapes formed on charged filaments of finite length, mimicking DNA looping by proteins with two DNA-binding domains. We find optimal loop shapes at different salt amounts, minimizing the sum of DNA elastic, DNA electrostatic, and protein elastic energies. We implement a simple model where intercharge repulsions do not affect the loop shape directly but can choose the energy-optimized shape from the allowed loop types. At low salt concentrations more open loops are favored due to enhanced repulsion of DNA charges, consistent with the results of computer simulations on formation of DNA loops by lac repressor. Then, we model the precise geometry of DNA binding by the lac tetramer and explore loop shapes, varying the confined DNA length and protein opening angle. The characteristics of complexes obtained, such as the total loop energy, stretching forces required to maintain its shape, and the reduction of electrostatic energy with increment of salt, are in good agreement with the outcomes of more elaborate numerical calculations for lac-repressor-induced DNA looping...|$|R

40|$|Molecular quantum-dot {{cellular}} automata (mQCA) is {{an emerging}} paradigm for nanoscale computation. Its revolutionary features are the expected operating frequencies (THz), the high device densities, the noncryogenic working temperature, and, above all, the limited power densities. The main drawback {{of this technology}} {{is a consequence of}} one of its very main advantages, that is, the extremely small size of a single molecule. Device prototyping and the fabrication of a simple circuit are limited by lack of control in the technological process [Pulimeno et al. 2013 a]. Moreover, high defectivity might strongly impact the correct behavior of mQCA devices. Another challenging point is the lack of a solid method for analyzing and simulating mQCA behavior and performance, either in ideal or defective conditions. Our contribution in this article is threefold: (i) We identify a methodology based on both ab-initio simulations and post-processing of data for analyzing an mQCA system adopting an electronic point of view (we baptized this method as "MoSQuiTo"); (ii) we assess the performance of an mQCA device (in this case, a bis- ferrocene molecule) working in nonideal conditions, using as a reference the information on fabrication-critical issues and on the possible defects that we are obtaining while conducting our own ongoing experiments on mQCA: (iii) we determine and assess the <b>electrostatic</b> energy <b>stored</b> in a bis-ferrocene molecule both in an oxidized and reduced form. Results presented here consist of quantitative information for an mQCA device working in manifold driving conditions and subjected to defects. This information is given in terms of: (a) output voltage; (b) safe operating area (SOA); (c) electrostatic energy; and (d) relation between SOA and energy, that is, possible energy reduction subject to reliability and functionality constraints. The whole analysis is a first fundamental step toward the study of a complex mQCA circuit. It gives important suggestions on possible improvements of the technological processes.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis describes a novel electromagnetic shockwave technique for use in compressing magnetic flux and {{to serve as the}} basis for a new approach to producing fast-rising voltage pulses with amplitudes of several hundred kV. The shockwave is produced by an exploding foil driven electric gun that accelerates a Mylar flyer to impact with a sample of aluminium powder. Both Japanese and Russian researchers have previously published experimental results for shockwave magnetic flux compression using an explosive driver. The present research considers replacing the explosive energy of this driver by the <b>electrostatic</b> energy <b>stored</b> in a capacitor bank, thereby enabling experiments to be performed in a laboratory enviromnent. Differences in performance that arise from the use of explosive and electrical driver are examined. A conventional electric gun system in planar geometry is developed to study the insulator-to-metallic transition in shock-compressed aluminium powder. This provides data on the conducting shock front in powder that can be used for flux compression and high-voltage pulse generation. A prototype cylindrical geometry system is described for proof-of-principle experiments, in which an imploding shockwave compresses flux towards the central axis of a system. A highcvoltage pulse can then be produced by the rapid time-change in the flux linking a suitably situated coil. Design calculation, constructional details and experimental results for the new system are all presented. The experimental programme is augmented by a detailed study of the fundamental shockwave processes. A new mathematical model for an electric gun is developed, that provides detailed description of the foil explosion and flyer acceleration processes. A hydrodynamic code including an equation of _state model for the powder is developed, and is shown to reproduce with reasonable accuracy the shock compression of aluminium powder by flyer impact, including the elastic precursor phenomenon. A magnetohydrodynamic code with an electrical conductivity model for the shockcompressed powder is developed for the study of flux compression and high-voltage pulse generation techniques. This provides a critical insight into the shockwave processes and facilitates a systematic design and performance prediction for future experimentation...|$|R
40|$|A molecular-dynamics-like {{method is}} {{presented}} for the simulation of a suspension of dielectric particles in a nonconductive solvent forming an electrorheological fluid. The method accurately accounts for both hydrodynamic and electrostatic interparticle interactions from dilute volume fractions to closest packing for simultaneous shear and electric fields. The hydrodynamic interactions and rheology are determined with the Stokesian dynamics methodology, while the electrostatic interactions, in particular, the conservative electrostatic interparticle forces, are determined from the electrostatic {{energy of the}} suspension. The energy of the suspension is computed from the induced particle dipoles by a method previously developed [R. T. Bonnecaze and J. F. Brady, Proc. R. Soc. London, Ser. A 430, 285 (1990) ]. Using the simulation, the dynamics can be directly correlated to the observed macroscopic rheology of the suspension {{for a range of}} the so-called Mason number, Ma, the ratio of viscous to electrostatic forces. The simulation is specifically applied to a monolayer of spherical particles of areal fraction 0. 4 with a particle-to-fluid dielectric constant ratio of 4 for Ma= 10 ^− 4 to [infinity]. The effective viscosity of the suspension increases as Ma^− 1 or with the square of the electric field for small Ma and has a plateau value at large Ma, as is observed experimentally. This rheological behavior can be interpreted as Bingham plastic-like with a dynamic yield stress. The first normal stress difference is negative, and its magnitude increases as Ma^− 1 at small Ma with a large Ma plateau value of zero. In addition to the time averages of the rheology, the time traces of the viscosities are presented along with selected "snapshots" of the suspension microstructure. In particular, at small Ma, the suspension dynamics exhibit two distinct motions: a slow elastic-body-like deformation where <b>electrostatic</b> energy is <b>stored,</b> followed by a rapid microstructural rearrangement where energy is viscously dissipated. It is suggested that the observed dynamic yield stress is associated with these dynamics...|$|R
40|$|We {{would like}} to point out here that {{although}} the idea expressed in the above mentioned paper [1] that the bare surface of a hot strange star may be a strong source of e + e − pairs of luminosity L e ± ∼ 3 × 10 51 ergs s − 1 for a duration of ∼ 10 s appears to be novel and exciting, it is, unfortunately unlikely to work because of several reasons. It is true that, it has already been hypothesesized by previous authors [2] that the bare surface of a strange star may be endowded with a superstrong electrostatic field of magnitude E ∼ 5 × 10 17 V cm − 1 ∼ 1. 5 × 10 13 statvolt cm − 1. Although such estimates, in general, could be fairly uncertain, let us momentarily assume that there is indeed such a field {{on the surface of the}} strange star over a height of ∆R ∼ 10 − 10 cm. As correctly envisaged in ref. 1, such a strong value of E>> Ecr = 1. 3 × 10 16 V cm − 1 is likely to convert the virtual pairs of the QED vacuum into real ones, i. e, create real e + e − pairs. For the sake of illustration, let us consider the region of the electric field as a parallel plate capacitor where the electrons comprise the negatively charged plate sitting on top of the positively charged stellar surface. If the number of electrons on the top plate is Ne, the vacuum discharge will be quenched after the generation of Ne real pairs- the Ne positrons thus created will move upward and tend to neutralize the preexisting negative charge whereas the freshly produced Ne electrons will move downward to neutralize the stellar surface and eventually the field would cease to exist.

40|$|The wetting {{of solid}} {{surfaces}} by liquids is commonly observed in nature, {{and it is}} also a key to a number of industrial applications and biological processes. In the past two centuries, most studies about wetting were devoted mainly to equilibrium situations and thus to static measurements. However, in most cases the dynamic wetting is more relevant and it has received less attension. The goal of this thesis is to study the effects of softness, wettability and curvature of the substrate and influence of external electric fields on dynamic wetting of viscous liquids. The thesis contains two main parts. The first part focuses on the early dynamic wetting of simple liquids on two types of surfaces that show different complexity: flat viscoelastic substrates and highly curved solid microparticles. On the viscoelastic substrates, a novel wetting stage dominated by inertia was found. The dynamics in this stage is characterized by the wetting radius, r=K't^α, following a power law similarly as on rigid surfaces, with the exponent α only depending on surface wettability. After the inertial wetting stage, spreading slows down and enters another stage dominated by the viscoelasticity of the substrate. The transition between inertial and viscoelastic stage is controlled by the surface “softness”. A simple theory was developed with Prof. Martin E. R. Shanahan to explain these findings. An early inertial wetting stage was also observed during the snap-in process, i. e. the wetting, of single colloidal particles into large water drops. The snap-in time is dependent on the capillary force and on inertia, but is independent on surface wettability. In contrast, the snap-in force is larger for hydrophilic and smaller for hydrophobic particles. A scaling model was proposed to describe the snap-in or early wetting of individual colloids. The second part of the thesis is devoted to study the dynamic wetting of rigid flat surfaces by simple and viscous liquids. First, the early spreading of drops of aqueous electrolyte solutions on various wettable surfaces driven by electrostatic forces, which was termed “electrospreading”, was investigated. It was found that early electrospreading is only dominated by inertia and electrostatics. The wetting dynamics is not only dependent on surface wettability and applied electric potential, but also on the concentration of the electrolyte solutions. The <b>electrostatic</b> energy <b>stored</b> in the electric double layer near the solid-liquid interface served as an additional energy for driving drop spreading. Based on molecular dynamics simulation done by Dr. Chunli Li, a simple scaling model was presented to describe the wetting dynamics. Finally, a systematic study of dynamic wetting of various wettable surfaces by viscous liquids was carried out. Both surface wettability and liquid viscosity influence the inertial stage of wetting as well as the viscous stage. During the inertial wetting stage, the effective mass of the spreading drop is affected by surface wettability and liquid viscosity. This results in a slower spreading speed on hydrophobic surfaces, or of highly viscous liquids. Viscous wetting did not take place on all substrates, but only on those surfaces with equilibrium contact angles smaller than a critical value, which depended again on liquid viscosity. A scaling law was proposed to explain these experimental observations. ...|$|R
