5|$|A recent phenomenon, the {{migration}} of rural Chinese workers began in 1984 when the Regulations of Permanent Residence Registration became less punitive and allowed people to move to find employment. People left rural areas to escape poverty, and females left {{due to the lack}} of local opportunities for women. In the cities, women could find new, low-paid factory-based jobs that did not require <b>highly</b> <b>skilled</b> workers. According to national statistics, the ratio of male to female migrant workers averages 2:1, and an estimated 30-40 million of the migrant women work in the cities, namely Hong Kong and Shenzhen.|$|E

5|$|In June 1944, the Manhattan Project {{employed}} some 129,000 workers, of whom 84,500 were construction workers, 40,500 were plant {{operators and}} 1,800 were military personnel. As construction activity fell off, the workforce declined to 100,000 a year later, {{but the number}} of military personnel increased to 5,600. Procuring the required numbers of workers, especially <b>highly</b> <b>skilled</b> workers, in competition with other vital wartime programs proved very difficult. In 1943, Groves obtained a special temporary priority for labor from the War Manpower Commission. In March 1944, both the War Production Board and the War Manpower Commission gave the project their highest priority.|$|E

The Maroons numbered around 551, and they helped quell some of the riots against the British from the Settlers. The Maroons later fought against the Temne during the Temne Attack of 1801.|$|R
40|$|This study {{attempted}} to expand {{previous research on}} employee retaliation against abusive supervision by evaluating both overt and covert retaliatory behaviors and the different mechanisms behind these behaviors. Initial confirmatory factor analysis did not find substantial support for a two-factor retaliation construct, but {{this may have been}} a result of the nature of behavioral retaliation items that composed the measures. Correlational analyses did not demonstrate clear discriminate validity between overt and overt retaliation; additionally, regression analyses did not find support for high performing or <b>highly</b> political <b>skilled</b> employees retaliating primarily through one form of retaliation. <b>Highly</b> political <b>skilled</b> and high performing employees performed less retaliatory behaviors overall when experiencing high amounts of abusive supervision. Although initial analyses did not support the distinction between overt and covert retaliation, mediation analyses did find some support for differential pathways. Specifically this investigation found that the relationship between abusive supervision and overt retaliation was mediated by feelings of hostility towards employees’ supervisors, whereas the relationship between abusive supervision and covert retaliation was mediated by perceptions of interactional injustice. Overall, this investigation provides mixed support for the distinction between overt and covert employee retaliatory behavior...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis compares occupational {{trends in the}} civilian and Navy Labor Markets. This is accomplished by matching civilian occupations to Navy ratings with similar job characteristics. The matched occupations are categorized according to technical level and skill level. These categories are used to compare trends in occupational participation and earnings. The results of the analysis support the conclusion that competition for <b>highly</b> technical and <b>skilled</b> workers between the Navy and civilian work force is increasing. It is recommended that the Navy continue to emphasize <b>highly</b> technical and <b>skilled</b> occupations when allocating reenlistment bonuses. It is also recommended that further research be conducted on the inclusion of occupational variables in regression models that predict reenlistment rates. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
5|$|Ingham (1991) {{shows how}} small, {{independent}} {{iron and steel}} manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed {{a higher percentage of}} <b>highly</b> <b>skilled</b> workers than their mass-production counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Kentish {{manufacture}} before 600 included glass beakers and jewelry. Kentish jewellers were <b>highly</b> <b>skilled,</b> {{and before}} the end of the sixth century they gained access to gold. Goods from Kent are found in cemeteries across the channel and as far away as at the mouth of the Loire. It is not known what Kent traded for all of this wealth, although it seems likely that there was a flourishing slave trade. It may well be that this wealth was the foundation of Æthelberht's strength, although his overlordship and the associated right to demand tribute would have brought wealth in its turn.|$|E
5|$|Others {{argue that}} while the issues of {{increasing}} public costs are real, the importance of continued growth of OHSU for the city's economy must be factored in as well. Not only is it the largest employer in the city, but OHSU is an important and effective vehicle to attract both federal funding, totaling more than 168million dollars for 2005, and a <b>highly</b> <b>skilled</b> workforce to the area. The growth in the current campus on the Marquam Hill is limited by access roads and parking, an expansion of which would likely cause more dramatic harm to the surrounding communities.|$|E

Both the expansion of French as a European lingua franca in the 18th century, and the modernization of the Prussian army have been credited to the Huguenots.|$|R

5|$|Paris was {{the central}} hub of culture and {{economic}} activity, and as such, the most <b>highly</b> <b>skilled</b> culinary craftsmen were to be found there. Markets in Paris such as Les Halles, la Mégisserie, those found along Rue Mouffetard, and similar smaller versions in other cities were {{very important to the}} distribution of food. Those that gave French produce its characteristic identity were regulated by the guild system, which developed in the Middle Ages. In Paris, the guilds were regulated by city government {{as well as by the}} French crown. A guild restricted those in a given branch of the culinary industry to operate only within that field.|$|E
