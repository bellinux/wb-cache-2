5|$|Scotland's home matches are {{presently}} {{covered by the}} pay-TV broadcaster Sky Sports. Television rights to away games vary; Sky Sports currently hold the rights to both home and away qualifiers for Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup. The arrangements to show Scotland matches on pay-TV have been criticised by the Scottish Government, who have argued that qualifying matches {{should be included in}} the list of sporting events which can only be broadcast on free-to-air television. The SFA have argued that limiting the rights to free-to-air broadcasters would severely reduce the amount of revenue that they could generate. An independent advisory panel recommended that qualifying matches played by all four Home Nations be added to the list, but UK Sports Minister Hugh Robertson deferred a decision until the completion of the <b>digital</b> <b>switchover.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Government of Croatia {{decided that}} {{multicast}} (simultaneous analog and digital DVB-T broadcasting {{of the main}} channels) was to cease in 2010.

The process was completed, achieving <b>digital</b> <b>switchover</b> on 5 October 2010, but geographically isolated areas were left with analog broadcasts. The last analog TV transmitter in Croatia was shut down on 30 September 2011, as DVB-T coverage was extended to 98.5 percent of households in Croatia and no less than 95 percent of households {{in each of the}} allotment regions. Approximately 6,000 households were left with no reception of DVB-T or analog TV broadcasts.|$|E

5|$|The first {{television}} signal broadcast in Croatia occurred in 1939 during the Zagreb Fair, where Philips showcased its television system. The first regular broadcasts started in 1956, when Television Zagreb was established {{as the first}} TV station in the Yugoslav Radio Television system. Color broadcasts began in 1975. Coverage and number of channels grew steadily, and by the 2000s there were four channels with nationwide coverage in Croatia.
