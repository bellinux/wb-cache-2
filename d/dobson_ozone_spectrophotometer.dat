50|$|In 1922 Ramanathan joined Rangoon University as Assistant Professor of physics. In 1925 he was {{appointed}} as a senior scientist in the India Meteorological Department and remained there {{until his retirement in}} 1948. The same year he joined the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmadabad as its first Director. He established <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> stations in India. He retired in 1966, but continued to serve PRL as Emeritus Professor until his death in 1984 at the age of 91.|$|E
50|$|He was {{appointed}} University Lecturer in Meteorology, Oxford. By studying meteorites {{he noticed that}} the temperature profile of the tropopause was not constant, as had previously been believed (hence the name stratosphere). In fact there was, he showed, a region where the temperature sharply rose. This, he proposed, was happening because UV radiation was heating ozone in what has become known as the ozone layer.He noted the connection between sunspots and weather, and measured the ultraviolet levels of our star. He built the first <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometers</b> and studied the results over many years. The Dobson unit, a unit of measurement of vertically integrated atmospheric ozone density, is named after him. The Brewer-Dobson circulation is a semi-eponymous model of atmospheric currents that explains the distribution of ozone by latitude.|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{concentration}} cell (ECC) ozone-sonde observations, made {{in recent years}} at ten stations whose locations range from the Arctic to Antarctica, have yielded a self-consistent ozone data base from which mean seasonal and annual latitudinal ozone vertical distributions to 35 km have been derived. Ozone measurement uncertainties are estimated, and results are presented in the Bass-Paur (1985) ozone absorption coefficient scale adopted for use with <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometers</b> January 1, 1992. The data should be useful for comparison with model calculations of the global distribution of atmospheric ozone, for serving as apriori statistical information in deriving ozone vertical distributions from satellite and Umkehr observations, and for improving the satellite and Umkehr ozone inversion algorithms. Attention is drawn to similar results based on a less comprehensive data set published in Ozone in the Atmosphere, Proceedings of the 1988 Quadrennial Ozone Symposium where errors in data tabulations occurred for three of the stations due to inadvertent transposition of ozone partial pressure and air temperature values...|$|R
40|$|Analyses of {{stratospheric ozone}} data {{determined}} from Dobson Umkehr measurements since 1977 at the Syowa (69. 0 &deg; S, 39. 6 &deg; E), Antarctica station show {{a significant decrease}} in ozone at altitudes higher than that of the 4 hPa pressure level during the 1980 s and 1990 s. Ozone values over Syowa have remained low since 2001. The time series of upper stratospheric ozone from the homogenized NOAA (/ 2) SBUV 8. 6 overpass data (± 4 &deg;, 24 h) are in qualitative agreement with Syowa station data. Ozone recovery during the austral spring over Syowa station appears to be slower than predicted by the Equivalent Effective Stratospheric Chlorine (EESC) curve. The long-term changes in station's equivalent latitude are derived from MERRA analysis at ~ 2 hPa and ~ 50 hPa. These data are used to attribute some of the upper and middle stratospheric ozone changes to the changes in vortex position relative to station location. In addition, high correlation of the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode (SAM) with polar upper stratospheric ozone during years of maximum solar activity points toward a strong relationship between the strength of the Brewer-Dobson circulation and the polar stratospheric ozone recovery. We have analyzed the results of ozone profiles over Syowa determined from measurements of the Umkehr effect by <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometers.</b> The <b>ozone</b> depletion attributable to CFCs is clearly visible in the record, but the recovery is slower than predicted. Further research indicates that dynamical and other chemical changes in the atmosphere are delaying the recovery over this station...|$|R
5000|$|Farkas {{monitored}} ozone {{from the}} 1950s until her retirement in 1986, undertaking world-leading {{research in the}} field of ozone monitoring over more than three decades. During 1960s her work shifted increasingly to the study of atmospheric ozone including the measurement of total ozone with the <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometer.</b> She became one of a small international group of atmospheric scientists dedicated to the study of atmospheric ozone-interest in which, in that era, was largely in use as a tracer to aid atmospheric circulation studies. Her work contributed substantially towards the discovery of the [...] "hole in the ozone layer" [...] which changed the world's behavior towards pollution forever. Her interest in atmospheric ozone measurement led naturally to the application of her expertise to the monitoring of surface ozone as part of air pollution studies and also to the measurement of atmospheric turbidity.|$|E
50|$|The Dobson Unit {{is defined}} as the {{thickness}} (in units of 10 µm) of that layer of pure gas which would be formed by the total column amount at STP. This is sometimes referred to as a 'milli-atmo-centimeter.' A typical column amount of 300 DU of atmospheric ozone therefore would form a 3 mm layer of pure gas at the surface of the Earth if its temperature and pressure conformed to STP. The Dobson unit is named after Gordon Dobson, a researcher at the University of Oxford who in the 1920s built the first instrument to measure total ozone from the ground, making use of a double prism monochromator to measure the differential absorption of different bands of solar ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer. This instrument, called the <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometer,</b> has formed the backbone of the global network for monitoring atmospheric ozone and was the source of the discovery in 1984 of the Antarctic ozone hole.|$|E
5000|$|The Umkehr is {{the time}} {{variation}} of {{the ratio of the}} scattered intensity at two different wavelengths. The word means reversal in German. The Umkehr effect is observed when measurements are made with ultraviolet spectrophotometer of the ratio of the zenith sky light intensities of two wavelengths in the solar ultraviolet when the sun is near the horizon. The shorter of two wavelengths (intensity I) is strongly absorbed and other (intensity I [...] ) is weakly absorbed. If the value of log(I/I [...] ) is plotted against the suns zenith angle, it is observed that this log-intensity ratio decreases as the zenith angle increases until a minimum is reached for a zenith angle of about 80 (when the wavelengths are 3114 and 3324 A0). This effect was first noticed by Götz in 1930. The Umkehr measurement is known as customarily N-value and is given by the logarithm base 10 of the ratio of cloudless zenith sky intensitities at two different wavelengths scaled by a multiplicative factor 100 plus a constant which depends on instruments and extraterrestrial radiation. Methods for deriving vertical distribution from the umkehr measurements were developed by Götz, Dobson and Meetham in 1934, using the <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> developed by Gordon Dobson. In 1964 Carlton Mateer provided analysis on information content in umkehr measurements.|$|E
40|$|The United States {{government}} has operated <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometers</b> at various sites, starting during the International Geophysical Year (1  July  1957 to 31  December  1958). A network of stations for long-term {{monitoring of the}} total column content (thickness of the ozone layer) of the atmosphere {{was established in the}} early 1960 s and eventually grew to 16 stations, 14 of which are still operational and submit data to the United States of America's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Seven of these sites are also part of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC), an organization that maintains its own data archive. Due to recent changes in data processing software the entire dataset was re-evaluated for possible changes. To evaluate and minimize potential changes caused by the new processing software, the reprocessed data record was compared to the original data record archived in the World Ozone and UV Data Center (WOUDC) in Toronto, Canada. The history of the observations at the individual stations, the instruments used for the NOAA network monitoring at the station, the method for reducing zenith-sky observations to total ozone, and calibration procedures were re-evaluated using data quality control tools built into the new software. At the completion of the evaluation, the new datasets are to be published as an update to the WOUDC and NDACC archives, and the entire dataset is to be made available to the scientific community. The procedure for reprocessing Dobson data and the results of the reanalysis on the archived record are presented in this paper. A summary of historical changes to 14 station records is also provided...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} work {{to improve}} the quality of total ozone and Umkehr data obtained in the past at the NOAA Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory and the <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> <b>ozone</b> observatories.

The improved data will be submitted in early 1996 to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) World Ozone Data Center (WODC), and the Atmospheric Environment Service for archiving.

5000|$|He {{received}} dispens for his D Sc (Ph D) {{degree at}} the University of Uppsala in 1925 while still in Norway. He left the following year with {{the closure of the}} Haldde observatory (after a short time in Tromsö) to become 'docent' at the Meteorological Institute in Uppsala and was elected professor in 1936 to succeed Filip Åkerblom. The institute was at this time located in the 'Observatorieparken' since the late 19th century. The professorship did then include an adjacent eight-room house, very suitable for his family of six children and a new wife. The Seismograph housed in an adjacent building was at the time part of the Institute. The 'Instrumenthuset', another separate small building housed the Theorell meteorograph [...] an automatic weather station, registering the temperarature since 1853. A new Institute building was on Kōhler's initiative completed in 1949,also located in observatorieparken. During 1947-48 Kŏhler also established an observatory including a 30m high tower in Marsta a small community north about 10 km north of Uppsala. Wind-speeds and temperature were measured and registered at several heights at the tower. Instruments were mostly built in the workshop at the Uppsala Institute. The tower was considered unsafe in the 1980s because of corrosion and subsequently demolished. A second professorship in meteorology to specialize on weather prognosis was on Köhler's recommendation instituted and upheld by Tor Bergeron in 1949. The institute had 2-3 positions at the level of assistant. These had jour-duty associated with making weather observations that included calibrating the thermometer readings of the 'Theorell'. The institute {{has its roots in the}} works of Anders Celsius and Köhler had a keen interest in supporting this heritage and the daily observations was part of this.and so was the care-taking of original records and instruments including the Celsius thermometer. One example of his historical interest was his paper on the 'older history of the thermometer'.The snow and cloud investigations on Pårtetjåkko and Haldde now resulted in several publications as well as theoretical aspects of these investigations. The chlorine in form of salts (in particular sodium-chlorate) in the fog and clouds as well as droplet-sizes was the subject of his 1933 article ref. Another work on the similar subject but now also including an analysis of the chlorine content in sea-water The aim of this study was to prove (or disprove) that the nuclei of condensation in the clouds had the same composition as that of the sea-water.He was also interested in climatology and acquired a <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> collecting data 1951-1986.|$|E

40|$|Analysis {{of global}} ozone {{variations}} {{for the period}} April 1970 to December 1975 was performed by using the reprocessed Nimbus 4 backscattered ultraviolet (BUV) measurements of total ozone.

40|$|The <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> {{measures}} {{the difference of}} intensity between selected wavelengths in the ultraviolet. The method uses an optical attenuator (the 'Wedge') in this measurement. The knowledge {{of the relationship of}} the wedge position to the attenuation is critical to the correct calculation of ozone from the measurement. The procedure to determine this relationship is time-consuming, and requires a highly skilled person to perform it correctly. The relationship has been found to change with time. For reliable ozone values, the procedure should be done on a Dobson instrument at regular intervals. Due to the skill and time necessary to perform this procedure, many instruments have gone as long as 15 years between procedures. This article describes an apparatus that performs the procedure under computer control, and is adaptable to the majority of existing Dobson instruments. Part of the apparatus is usable for normal operation of the Dobson instrument, and would allow computer collection of the data and real-time ozone measurements...|$|E

40|$|In {{the spring}} of 1979 an {{investigation}} was started involving the intercomparison of five ground based instruments designed to measure total ozone.

Three of these instruments use optical filters to make spectrophotometric determinations of total atmospheric ozone. The M- 83 uses glass absorption filters to isolate the ultraviolet bands used. The Canterbury and the SenTran instruments use narrow-bandpass dielectric interference filters for the same purpose. Instruments employing optical filters are very appealing since they can be made small, rugged, and relatively inexpensive.

A strong anti-correlation of - 0. 88 was observed between the Dobson’s ozone profile and the EPTOMS in the month July-September. The Dobson data showed considerable high frequency fluctuations with no clear seasonal trend. Maximum inter-annual differences for both instruments fell within the period of low precipitation in the West Africa region.

40|$|Spectral {{ultraviolet}} (UV) {{and visible}} irradiance has been monitored at the South Pole with a SUV- 100 spectro-radiometer since 1991. A new data version labeled “Version 2 ” {{has recently been}} produced, which has a higher accuracy than the original released “Version 0 ”. We have established a UV climatology for the South Pole based on the new data set, focusing {{on the effects of}} cloudiness, total column ozone, and volcanic aerosols. In addition, total column ozone was calculated from the spectral UV measurements for solar zenith angles (SZA) up to 87 ° using a recently developed algorithm. This new total ozone data set can complement <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> observations to validate satellite total ozone data. At the South Pole, NASA/TOMS Version 7 overpass data exceed SUV- 100 total ozone measurements by 5 - 8 %. In contrast, TOMS Version 8 data agree on average to within 2 % with SUV- 100 measurements, and the ratio of the two data sets shows virtually no dependence on SZA and the ozone amount. The good agreement confirms that the well-documented bias of TOMS Version 7 data at high austral latitudes was successfully reduced with the release of Version 8.

40|$|Ozone {{measurements}} using <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> {{have been}} made in Canada since the late 1950 s. These instruments were installed between 1957 and 1964 at five Canadian sites and replaced by the more advanced Brewer instruments in the mid- 1980 s. Ozone measurements have also been made from satellites and in particular the daily global total ozone has been measured by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) during the period October 1978 through May 1993. Since the 1970 s the vertical profile of ozone concentration has also been measured with balloonsondes at several Canadian sites. Recent studies of ozone trends over Canada have shown negative trends in total ozone (WMO, 1994). In this thesis ozone trends in the troposphere and the lower to midstratosphere are examined using the three types of data sets. The purpose has been to investigate the ozone variation pattern in the northern hemisphere and to determine the possible effects of some meteorological factors on this variation during the period from January 1979 to December 1992. A statistical model for a trend analysis of the ozone time series has been used. The model included terms for seasonal variations in mean ozone and seasonal variations in ozone trends as well as the effect of some meteorological factors. An attempt to assess stratospheric temperature and ozone-temperature trends in the troposphere and lower and mid-stratosphere has also been made. It is concluded that while there is clear evidence for a negative trend in the total ozone column, the full coupling is masked by the seasonal variation...|$|E
40|$|Summaries {{of ozone}} {{measurements}} made at Little America, Antarctica during 1957 and 1958 are presented. Data include both total ozone observations {{made with a}} <b>Dobson</b> <b>Ozone</b> <b>Spectrophotometer</b> and surface ozone concentrations measured with the automatic ozone recorder developed by Regeller. Wind and ozone roses were constructed to examine the variation of surface ozone with wind direction, and in addition the net meridional transport of surface ozone was computed for each month for a year. The computed northward transport of surface ozone {{during the winter months}} of June through September suggests a model for atmospheric circulation in the Antarctic. Assuming no ozone is created or destroyed by photochemical or other means during this dark period and that Little America is representative of its latitude, steady-state conditions require that the low-level outflow of ozone be compensated by inflow at ot'her levels. Both the lower stratospheric circumpolar jet inhibiting meridional transport and the stability of the Antarctic stratosphere inhibiting downward vertical transport lead us to ascribe the principal OZOIIC influx to the troposphere above the surface layer. Computations of the tropospheric ozone concentrations required to replace the low-level loss of ozone, using Itubin's values for the vertical distribution of the tropospheric mass transports, are in good agreement with the observations made by ozonesonde at Halley Bay. It thus appears that some of the ozone manufactured in the sunlit stratosphere of lower latitudes which enters the troposphere through the tropopause gap associated with the mid-latitude jet stream is transported into the Antarctic by winds of the vigorous winter storms which move around and into the continent, and finally sinks and then flows northward again as part of the 2 - to 3 -km. thick surface layer. 1...|$|E
40|$|Meteorological {{observations}} at Syowa Base in 5 th expedition {{were maintained}} {{in the year}} 1960 - 1962. Among scientific disciplines importance {{was attached to the}} meteorological section consisting of 4 members, to take various types of observation. General and characteristic features in meteorological observations are summarized in the following. A. Surface observation: 3 -hourly observations were made throughout the wintering period, 4 observations were transmitted to Mother Station (Mawson), twice daily. In addition to the specified observations, radiation, sunshine and ground temperature were also observed by continuous selfrecording instrument respectively. The special features of this year is that, compared with the appearance of the annual minimum temperature normally in September in the Antarctic, the minimum occurred in July and it is shown that the average temperature in September was 5. 5 ℃ higher than the normal value. B. Upper air observation: One time (12 Z) daily rawinsonde observations were made throughout the year except a few cases of only radiosonde observation. Twice daily (00 and 12 Z) rawinsonde observations were made during World Meteorological Interval of Post-IGY (July 16 -July 25). All observations were transmitted to Mother Station every day. Equipments used : D- 55 A type Automatic Direction Finder (Similar type with GMD- 1 A) JMA-RSII Rawinsonde, 1680 Mc JMA-SIII Radiosonde, 27 Mc 800 g Balloon (Latex) CaH_ 2 Cans for Hydrogen gas to fill balloons. Monthly average temperatures and heights were shown in respective figures. In September, combined with the surface temperature, the strong warm-air inflow throughout the troposphere below 300 mb could be seen. A rapid warming in the stratosphere in spring was also clearly observed. Wind rose at some selected pressure levels were shown in Figs. 7 - 10. In general, the wind is strong in winter, especially in the stratosphere and NE-ly and SW-ly winds are predominant in the troposphere, SW-ly or W-ly in the stratosphere. The E-ly winds were also observed above 30 mb in summer. C. Ozone observation: i) Total ozone observation <b>Dobson</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> was used for this observation. Table 3 shows the results of only direct sunlight observation with reliable AD wave length setting. Comparison is made in Figs. 11 and 12 between Syowa Base, Little America and Halley Bay. Total ozone amount can be said to increase in spring from November to December over the Antarctic and the maximum seems to appear in summer. The 10 -days average values of Syowa Base and Halley Bay show to be in good similarity in spite of different year. It may also be noted that a good correlation exists between rapid increase of ozone amount and temperature of 50 mb in late November. ii) Surface ozone observation The density of surface ozone was measured on days without drifting snow from the end of February 1961. Based on Ehmert method, the equipment developed by Mr. KAWAMURA, Meteorological Research Institute, was used. It may be seen that the density increase in autumn and reaches its maximum value about 40 μg/m^ 3 in early June in polar night season, then decreases rapidly until the sun comes back and indicates minimum in early summer. It should be noted that there is 6 months 2 ̆ 7 phase difference between the surface ozone amount and the total ozone amount. D. Special observation: Snow accumulation Toward ENE-ly direction from the base, 6 snow stakes were erected and snow accumulation was observed several times every month. The result is shown in Table 4 in which the annual accumulation was 121 cm. Average density of snow was 0. 474 and the equivalent amount of water was 574 m/m...|$|E

The decreased ozone concentration in the lower stratosphere, similar to as same as the Antarctic ozone hole, was observed south of 60 °S.

40|$|Arguments are {{presented}} {{showing that the}} basic empirical model of the solar backscatter UV (SBUV) instrument degradation used by Cebula et al. (1988) in their analysis of the SBUV data is {{likely to lead to}} an incorrect estimate of the ozone trend. A correction factor is given as a function of time and altitude that brings the SBUV data into approximate agreement with the SAGE, SME, and <b>Dobson</b> network <b>ozone</b> trends. It is suggested that the currently archived SBUV ozone data should be used with caution for periods of analysis exceeding 1 yr, since {{it is likely that the}} yearly decreases contained in the archived data are too large...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to re-evaluate NOAA/CMDL <b>Dobson</b> <b>spectrophotometer</b> total <b>ozone</b> data during FY 94 from the {{stations}} Haute Provence, France; Lauder, New Zealand; Perth, Australia; and Poker Flat, Alaska and the Umkehr data from Boulder, Colorado and Mauna Loa, Hawaii. During the second year the authors planned to re-evaluate total ozone data from Byrd, Hallett and South Pole, Antarctica; Fairbanks, Alaska; Puerto Montt, Chile; Huancayo, Peru and Umkehr data from Huancayo...|$|R
