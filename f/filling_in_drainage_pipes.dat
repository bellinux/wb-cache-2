30|$|The field campaigns showed that, when heavy {{rainfall}} occurred after manure spreading, EEQ values <b>in</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>pipe</b> water at “Shaft” and “Outlet” reached peak values higher than 10  ng/l during {{short periods of}} 4 – 8  h. Different timing or different practices of neighbouring farmers concerning manure application {{can lead to a}} series of EEQ peaks in the receiving stream: during FC 3, at “Outlet”, EEQ values > 10  ng/l were detected, while EEQ at “Shaft” remained much lower. This was due to manure application in {{the upper part of the}} catchment of “Outlet”. In contrast, during FC 4, the EEQ was much higher at “Shaft” than at “Outlet”. Furthermore, in two of our five field campaigns, estrogenic activity was found <b>in</b> the <b>drainage</b> <b>pipe</b> water at “Shaft” without an apparent link to manure application directly before the field campaign (FC 3), or even rainfall during the field campaign (FC 2). This coincides with the results of Kjaer et al. [13]. They found that a washout of estrogens through <b>drainage</b> <b>pipes</b> can still occur months after manure application, and related it to soil conditions. Gall et al. [29] observed that “significant export (of hormones) was found during the spring prior to the addition of animal wastes”. This suggests that “soil may act as a long-term reservoir for E 2 in the environment” [30].|$|R
30|$|The {{composition}} of manure depends on different factors: storage time influences {{the concentration of}} estrogens and the distribution between the different estrogens [27]. Age structure of the cattle herd, the ratio of pregnant cows, livestock husbandry conditions (grazing vs. confinement) {{and the use of}} feed additives may influence the amount of estrogens in manure. Finally, farmers mix manure with water or other types of manure (Table  4), according to their experience, needs, manure type and availability. In this study, EEQ values of manure samples were systematically higher in the YES than in the ER-CALUX. This finding will be discussed in the “Oestrogenic activity <b>in</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>pipe</b> water” section.|$|R

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Much research activity is carried out to reduce water consumption for domestic purposes. This leads {{to the possibility of}} reducing the amount of water introduced into building drainage systems. However, an accurate estimation of the flow attenuation within building <b>drainage</b> <b>pipes</b> is of great importance to prevent solid eposition and subsequent blockage. The research is focused on the field of subcritical flow in partially-filled pipes. Experimental and numerical investigations have been carried out to study the wave attenuation in the following configurations encountered <b>in</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>pipe</b> systems: i) A simple pipe, ii) A pipe subject to one concentrated lateral inflow, iii) A pipe with gate fixed at the downstream section, generating an interaction between wave and backwater profiles. In the present study the Saint-Venant equations are derived in their general and characteristic forms. A number of numerical procedures for solution of the Saint-Venant equations are reviewed, and the rectangular grid characteristics method, diffusing scheme and Strelkoff's implicit method are chosen to solve the equations. The stability of the finite-difference methods used is investigated for free-outfall and controlled outfall boundary conditions. An experimental installation consisting of 0. 105 m diameter uPVC pipe is used to investigate the characteristics of the flow and to form test cases for the numerical methods. Comparisons between computed and observed depth hydrographs, peak depths and depth variations along the pipe are made for subcritical flow in a pipe of slope 1 / 300. The rectangular-grid characteristics method and the diffusing scheme are also applied to supercritical flow. Flow tests are undertaken for supercritical flow in a pipe of slope 1 / 200 to validate the use of these methods. The investigation revealed that the attenuation rate of peak depths is affected by the volume of the waves. The implicit method is the most suitable method, dealing efficiently with most problems encountered <b>in</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>pipe</b> systems of flat slope. The diffusing scheme can model the attenuation of supercritical flow within building <b>drainage</b> <b>pipes.</b> Financial support from the ORS Award Scheme, Mechanical Engineering Department of Brunel University and Egyptian Government are acknowledged...|$|R

40|$|An anti-vortex baffle is {{a liquid}} {{propellant}} management device placed adjacent to an outlet of the propellant tank. Its {{purpose is to}} substantially reduce or eliminate the formation of free surface dip and vortex, as well as prevent vapor ingestion into the outlet, as the liquid drains out through the flight. To design an effective anti-vortex baffle, Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations were undertaken for the NASA Ares I vehicle LOX tank subjected to the simulated flight loads with and without the anti-vortex baffle. The Six Degree-Of-Freedom (6 - DOF) dynamics experienced by the Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV) during ascent were modeled by modifying the momentum equations in a CFD code to accommodate the extra body forces from the maneuvering in a non-inertial frame. The present analysis found that due to large moments, the CLV maneuvering has {{significant impact on the}} vortical flow generation inside the tank. Roll maneuvering and side loading due to pitch and yaw are shown to induce swirling flow. The vortical flow due to roll is symmetrical with respect to the tank centerline, while those induced by pitch and yaw maneuverings showed two vortices side by side. The study found that without the anti-vortex baffle, the swirling flow caused surface dip during the late stage of drainage and hence early vapor ingestion. The flow can also be non-uniform <b>in</b> the <b>drainage</b> <b>pipe</b> as the secondary swirling flow velocity component can be as high as 10 % of the draining velocity. An analysis of the vortex dynamics shows that the swirling flow <b>in</b> the <b>drainage</b> <b>pipe</b> during the Upper Stage burn is mainly the result of residual vortices inside the tank due to conservation of angular momentum. The study demonstrated that the swirling flow <b>in</b> the <b>drainage</b> <b>pipe</b> can be effectively suppressed by employing the anti-vortex baffle...|$|R

30|$|One pathway from soil {{to water}} is through {{preferential}} flow channels and <b>drainage</b> <b>pipes</b> (also called “tile drains” or “mole drains”). For the monitoring of this pathway, the sampling procedure {{seems to be}} crucial. Based on grab samples taken in creeks and from “tile drains” on four different dates, [19] found no enhanced estrogen concentrations in surface water collected upstream and downstream of a large confinement dairy operation in the mid-western United States. In contrast to that, a Danish one-year study on two field sites with “structured, loamy soil” [13] found E 1 and E 2 <b>in</b> the <b>drainage</b> <b>pipes</b> within 14 – 30 days after application of pig manure slurry as well as continued leaching in high concentrations after 3  months.

[20] used “POCIS” passive samplers to monitor 10 streams in England and Wales, from November 2005 to January 2006. Their study sites lay upstream and downstream of intensive livestock farms and were chosen due to a high predicted steroid load. estrogenic activities were higher in 50  % and steroid concentrations were higher in 60  % of the downstream sites. However, estrogenic activity could not solely be attributed to E 1 and E 2.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the potential impact}} of a Georgia regulation that allows individual landowners to encase 200 -ft sections of small (< 25 gal/min mean annual flow) headwater trout streams <b>in</b> buried <b>drainage</b> <b>pipes.</b> <b>In</b> the Blue Ridge physiographic province in North Georgia, 41 % of privately held lands drain into these small streams.

Small headwater streams in this region have a diverse aquatic biota (~ 30 taxa) indicating good water quality (10 - 14 EPT taxa), even though some of the streams are intermittent. Aquatic insects drifting downstream provide food for drift-feeding fishes such as trout. Insect drift immediately downstream from a buried reach was predominantly oligochaetes, indicative of poor water quality, whereas there were 5 - 6 EPT taxa in the drift from forested headwaters. Burying streams in pipes eliminates aquatic habitat.

In this study, empirical expressions are proposed to determine the probable drainage loads for a stack serving a number of domestic washrooms of high-rise buildings in Hong Kong, taking the factors of the attenuation effects of an assigned gradient 1 / 100 <b>in</b> a horizontal <b>drainage</b> <b>pipe</b> as well as the discharge patterns and simultaneous use of appliances in a typical domestic washroom into account. With reported probable demand patterns of domestic appliances from laboratory testing results, on-site measurements and survey studies, the probable discharge flow patterns in the stack are estimated with MonteCarlo simulations for the probable maximum discharge flow rates from a number of domestic washrooms at a limiting failure rate. It is shown that, comparing with the estimation method in current practice, a reduction of predicted discharge flow rate at the stack serving a number of typical domestic washrooms would be up to 13 % by taking account of the above two factors.

40|$|Many {{regulating}} {{ecosystem services}} exhibit non-excludability and non-rivalry characteristics akin to public goods.

Policymakers, therefore, find difficulties in determining a correct economic valuation for regulating ecosystem services, with potentially severe consequences for aligning policy for ecosystem service provision with public preferences for service delivery. This research used a choice modelling approach to estimate public preferences for delivery of two regulating ecosystem services; reductions in the flood risk to the British city of York (implemented by <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> <b>drainage</b> ditches <b>in</b> peat moorland further up the catchment), {{and a reduction in}} CO 2 emissions (implemented by planting Poplar trees for biomass either locally in the study area or elsewhere in the UK). The choice experiment presented respondents with options providing different levels of CO 2 reduction, implemented locally or nationally, and different levels of flood risk reduction, at a range of different prices, with a tax as the payment vehicle. Subsequent analysis with latent class (LC) models showed considerable heterogeneity of preference among respondents, particularly with regard to the location of tree planting for CO 2 reduction. One LC segment showed a significant preference for achieving a high level CO 2 reduction through national, as opposed to local tree planting, potentially indicating the existence of NIMBYism. The same LC segment displayed a preference for moderate reductions in the flood risk to York, even though this would deliver no personal benefit for a substantial proportion of the segment.
