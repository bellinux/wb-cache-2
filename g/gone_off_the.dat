5|$|The {{police officer}} who {{discovered}} the wreck initially suspected that only the semi had <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> road. After further investigation, he found the van and called for emergency services, whose arrival was delayed by freezing rain. The rear wall and {{a large portion of}} the right-hand side of the van, including three rows of seats, had been torn away, ejecting several occupants. Seven players and the wife of the team coach were pronounced dead at the scene. The coach, his daughter and the two other players survived the accident and were rushed to Chaleur Regional Hospital in Bathurst. Of the injured, one was listed in critical condition, and two in stable. The fourth was released shortly after the accident. The driver of the truck was not injured.|$|E
5|$|The Angel of Darkness started {{development}} {{three years}} prior to its release under the working title Tomb Raider next generation. As part of the preparation for the game, the company conducted market research, and decided {{to create a new}} setting and story for the main character. One of the main drives behind the game was fully utilising the new platform's potential and reinventing the character of Lara Croft, including rebuilding her character model and allowing her to perform melee combat. It was the first game in the series to be made for the PlayStation 2 platform: the previous entry in the series, , had pushed the PlayStation to its technical limits, contributing to lower review scores and sales than previous titles in the series. Core Design separated into two teams, with a new team working on Angel of Darkness and series regulars on Tomb Raider: Chronicles. After the completion of Tomb Raider: Chronicles, lead programmer Richard Morton came over and found that the new team had <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> rails, scrapping the entire project once already and completing only the game's basic story. The developers later admitted to being overambitious. Some of them also commented that none of the Core team were prepared for the added complexity of developing for the advanced PlayStation 2. Jonell Elliott returned as the voice of Lara Croft. This would be the last time she provided the voice, with Keeley Hawes taking over for Tomb Raider: Legend.|$|E
25|$|It {{must have}} seemed like déjà {{vu all over again}} for England as they started day two, with Australia again poised for a large total. Border and Jones resumed and added a further 20 before Border was caught behind of Capel for 76. Jones was finally removed for 122, and Steve Waugh, who seemed to have <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> boil {{slightly}} following his blistering first three tests, went for a disappointing 14, clean bowled by Igglesden. Rain interrupted temporarily, but play soon resumed, and the South London crowd was then treated with a blistering display of low-order hitting from Queensland-born keeper Ian Healy, who battered 44 off 44 balls. His innings lasted less than an hour and contained six 4s, also taking the Australian total past 400 for the sixth time in as many tests. Eventually he fell, caught behind of the bowling of Derek Pringle, who then proceeded to tear into the tail, collecting the last four wickets. Although Trevor Hohns (30) and Merv Hughes (21) lasted long enough to take the Australian total to 468, the tourists were all out shortly before stumps. Enough play was left to force England to face an awkward few overs, and the Australians made the most of it, dislodging Graham Gooch LBW to Alderman for a third ball duck. England finished the day on 1 for 1, both not out batsmen yet to score.|$|E

25|$|At this time, the Hoyas {{borrowed}} {{a page from}} Villanova's offensive strategy and started running the four corners offense, with the hopes of causing the Wildcats to abandon their regular defense and shift to man-to-man coverage. The team's plan was foiled when a pass by Bill Martin deflected out of bounds off the shin of Broadnax. Under 30 seconds had <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> clock when the Wildcats regained the ball. Villanova resumed their ball-control offense, and took the lead with 2:37 remaining on a made shot by Jensen; the Wildcats had taken 62 seconds to run the play. Jensen's shot was the last attempted by Villanova in the game; all of the team's remaining points came on free throws. The Wildcats scored the next four points and were up 59–54 going into the final 84 seconds. Although the team was unsuccessful on multiple one-and-one free throw attempts, they added seven more points in the final portion of the game. The last made free throw, on the second of two attempts by Pressley, gave the Wildcats a 66–62 advantage with approximately 10 seconds on the clock. A shot by Michael Jackson brought the Hoyas to within two points in the closing seconds. Wingate stopped the clock from expiring by hitting {{the ball out of}} play with two seconds left. Jensen inbounded the ball to McClain, who had gone to the floor, and McClain kept possession until time expired and the Wildcats won the game and the Division I national championship, 66–64.|$|E

500|$|The new 3D {{graphics}} received mixed remarks. Harris {{called the}} game [...] "raphically ... a mixed bag", praising the visual {{style of the}} game's Pokémon but criticizing the [...] "poorly modeled and animated, angular" [...] style of the Trainers. GameSpot reviewer Ryan Davis offered a similar opinion, concluding that [...] "he visual style ... has <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> deep end". GamePro writer Star Dingo called the graphics as a whole [...] "insanely cute" [...] but criticized the lack of animations showing two Pokémon attacking in tandem. GameZone's review took a more positive stance, saying that [...] "nimations are brief but impressive; each attack move is more elaborate and more extravagant on the 'Cube." [...] Nintendo Power thought similarly, commending the [...] "amazing level of detail".|$|E

Holy Soap said the wedding will leave fans [...] "stunned" [...] and described the pair as [...] "odd". Dawson said, regarding the sudden marriage, that [...] "Darren doesn’t suddenly fall in love with Hannah or vice-versa.

500|$|During James' meeting, he was {{informed}} that a letter bomb had exploded {{in a suburb of}} Bournemouth. In a documentary about the investigation in 2009, James said [...] "There was {{a knock at the door}} and I was told by one of my officers that an incendiary device had just <b>gone</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> atmosphere of the meeting changed. Clearly there was a risk and the threat was very real". Jean Evans, the woman who opened the letter bomb, was taken to hospital with minor injuries and a bomb disposal team from the British Army was dispatched to the scene. The device had used a party popper to detonate gunpowder inside the envelope. Immediately after the first letter bomb, Dorset Police alerted Royal Mail to look out for similar packages and several were found in a sorting office, having been delayed because insufficient stamps had been placed on them, and defused by the Army. A further seven of the packages were delivered to the homes of Tesco customers. Following the spate of letter bombs, the Army's bomb disposal team was stationed in Bournemouth—something that only usually happens when political party conferences are held in the town—and placed on stand-by.|$|E

500|$|On April 23, Yankovic {{recorded}} [...] "Christmas at Ground Zero". The song, [...] "a cheery little tune about death, {{destruction and}} the end of the world" [...] was the result of Scotti Brothers Records' insistence that Yankovic release a Christmas record. After Yankovic presented the song to his label, they relented, because it was [...] "a little different from what they were expecting." [...] After the song's release, some radio stations banned the record, a move that Yankovic attributes to [...] "most people [...] to hear about nuclear annihilation during the holiday season." [...] Following the September 11 attacks, when the general term [...] "ground zero" [...] was co-opted as a proper name for the World Trade Center site where two of those attacks took place, the disturbing lyrics caused this song to be banned largely from radio. Yankovic wanted the song to receive a video, but due to budget reasons, his label did not agree. Yankovic, however, directed one himself which was mostly made up of stock footage, with a live action finale that was filmed in an economically devastated part of the Bronx, New York that looked like a bomb had <b>gone</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> final original that was recorded was [...] "Good Enough for Now", a country music pastiche about how the singer's lover, who, while not the best, will do for now.|$|E
