When dealing with the resident, regardless of his or her health state, PHNs always regard them not only as a recipient of care, but also as a potential provider of care services. The study finds that the cultivation of a sense of belonging and connections between residents is the most effective nursing care method in the community based practice. In a community 2 ̆ 7 zukuri 2 ̆ 7 building, it is important <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> the resident <b>to</b> go out in public where they can meet people, while helping them <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> develop relationships they have initiated.

This approach was designed so {{that it may be}} applied by core subject teachers in courses with students who typically do not engage well with these aspects of their studies. Our focus was specifically on the ‘bigger picture’ of writing skills development by <b>encouraging</b> students <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> analyse for themselves a particular genre from their own discipline, and how to use this knowledge to develop an appropriately academic style in writing their own essay. Our approach involved combining the expertise of subject teacher and linguist in running four workshops in class time {{during the first half of}} a semesterised course. These workshops had associated homework tasks, designed incrementally to contribute to students’ understanding and application of the skills they need for academic writing. These were followed by the submission of a written report on the topics covered during the first six weeks of the semester, and was of direct relevance to their degree major. Assessment criteria focused on both technical content and academic literacy. With this integrated approach to literacy and content development it was intended to engage traditionally resistant students with the development of their academic language skills, and also to model a possible approach for the engagement of STEM academics in fostering this academic literacy development. Student participants in this programme agreed that this strategy improved both their writing skills and their understanding of course content. Kathryn Amos and Ursula McGowa...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the status of culture studies within the field of international business research, and to examine how two main paradigms – essentialism and social constructivism – relate to the discourse in this field. We analyze the main points of the two paradigms, and discuss how the relationship between them has evolved. Findings - We show that essentialism and social constructivism have a paradoxical relationship. They seem to be mutually exclusive, yet each offers unique insights into the notion of culture. Both are necessary for a complete understanding of culture, yet they cannot be integrated in any normal sense. We see the relationship between the two paradigms as paradoxical: that is, we see them as ontologically complementary yet epistemologically incommensurable. Taking inspiration from Bohr’s principle of complementarity, we understand the two competing paradigms of culture studies as both necessary and yet as incompatible. Research limitations - Future research should help to improve the conceptual clarity with which the relationship between the two paradigms is portrayed here, thereby enhancing the empirical rigor of the argument we make in this paper. Practical implications – We <b>encourage</b> practitioners <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> switch, both sequentially and spatially, between the two paradigms of culture (fundamentally incommensurable though they are). This involves taking a “both/or” approach to the two paradigms. Originality/Value - We show for the first time that Bohr’s complementarity principle is illustrative and useful for understanding the paradoxical relationship between essentialism and social constructivism. Inspired by two principles enunciated by Bohr – that of complementarity and that of classical concepts – we argue that the two competing paradigms are necessary yet 3 incommensurable. We therefore suggest that culture scholars switch between the two paradigms, instead of seeing each as negating the other...|$|R

The collection of the principal data was accomplished by using a survey paper to answer the study’s research questions. It involved 224 customers using the Islamic banking services. This study was analysed using the Statistical Packages for Social Science (SPSS) by applying descriptive analysis and inferential analysis (Independent T-test, One Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Correlation Pearson).

40|$|The {{project on}} Cassava Production System Adjustment to Reduce Soil Erosion is a {{cooperative}} project among the Department of Agricultural Extension (DOAE), Department of Agricultural (DOA) and the Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT). The {{purpose of the}} project is to make farmers {{aware of the importance}} of soil erosion and to develop and disseminate suitable and effective measures to reduce the problem. This is done by the use of a farmer participatory approach, in which farmers are asked to select and test in their own fields cassava production practices that reduce soil erosion. The first phase of the project had a duration of five years (1994 - 1998) and was implemented in two pilot sites in Nakhon Ratchasima and Sra Kaew provinces. The results of the project indicate that once farmers saw the amounts of soil loss in their own erosion control trials, they realized the importance of erosion and the need to control soil degradation in cassava areas. They also tested, evaluated and selected suitable methods for reducing soil erosion. The farmers in the two pilot sites selected mainly the use of vetiver grass contour barriers as the most effective and suitable technique. They now grow vetiver grass for this purpose on about 48 hectares, while the planting of vetiver grass is still expanding. The method of participatory research involves farmers directly in decision making at every step, from planning the project to obtaining results and drawing conclusions, and lets farmers select the treatments to be tried by themselves. This <b>encourages</b> them <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> analyze problems and find solutions collectively that are in line with the needs of the community as a whole.

5000|$|In 2009, Phat Beets Produce partnered up {{with the}} Children’s Hospital in Oakland to create an obesity {{prevention}} program for Oakland youth. Obesity is a growing health problem in urban communities where opportunity to exercise and access to healthy food is limited. According to {{a study conducted by}} Rice University in 2012, children that live in poorer communities are 30% more likely to become obese than their counterparts in wealthy neighborhoods. Some of the risk factors that contribute to childhood obesity include the prevalence of sugary and processed foods, television advertisements and media portrayal of fast foods, unsafe neighborhoods that discourage exercise, and lack of breastfeeding. [...] Overall, a combination of lack of exercise and a poor diet leads to severe consequences in terms of this burden of chronic disease. Another important issue in urban communities like Oakland is the development and growth of food deserts in these regions. A food desert is an urban neighborhood without access to affordable and healthy foods. [...] Hence, the residents only have fast food or convenience stores to fulfill their nutritional needs. Continued consumption of low-nutrition food contributes to a greater prevalence of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. According to the Economic Research Service from the USDA, there are 23.5 million people who currently live in food deserts. A disproportionate amount of these residents are low-income and under-resourced citizens. According to the USDA, the official definition of a food desert is “census tract with a substantial share of residents who live in low-income areas that have low levels of access to a grocery store or healthy, affordable food retail outlet.” [...] Low-income is a “poverty rate of 20 percent or greater or a median family income at or below 80 percent of the area median family income.” [...] Low-access means that “500 people or 33% or of the tract population live more than a mile away from a grocery store.” The Federal government is working {{to reduce the number of}} food deserts in the United States. The 2011 budget included $150 million in private and public investments for programs that will promote healthy food alternatives in food deserts. [...] In order to combat the growing obesity problem and reduce food deserts, the Healthy Hearts Youth Empowerment program promotes healthy living practices by teaching youth how to create their own urban garden, grow their own food, and change their diets to improve overall health. The youth in the program are <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> cook by themselves and make conscious and healthy choices when selecting food for consumption. The underlying idea behind this program is to promote health education among the youth. By promoting a healthy eating lifestyle, the program hopes that the participants will be able to bring what they <b>learned</b> back <b>to</b> their own family and community. Each cycle of this program consists of a group of 8-12 students. In terms of community gardening, they have transformed the ¼ acre plot (approximately 10,000 sq. ft) in Dover Street Park into arable land. This urban garden has produced over 3000 pounds of produce every year. The produce is sold to local residents in the community through the Phat Beet Produce’s clinic based farm stands. In addition, this partnership has a “Fresh Fellows” food justice program that specifically targets teenagers who are at risk of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. The “Fresh Fellows” program is dedicated to teaching the teenagers to be leaders in the food justice system. Over the years, this program has trained over 60 youth leaders. [...] One of the participants in the 2011 summer session stated “Well I’m going to bring to my community to more gardens, activities with more peers, more hands on gardening activities because we don’t have enough of that. But I feel like I would take basically everything I <b>learned</b> here <b>to</b> my community and my family because I feel like if I could benefit from it then someone else can benefit from it. ” Urban gardening is positively correlated with health benefits in the community.

They usually support the acquisition of language by <b>encouraging</b> students <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> decode information within a sentence. In this thesis it is suggested that literacy skills in children five to seven years of age can be obtained with a broader understanding of language and its representation. Oral storytelling is presented as a way to develop metacognitive skills with a focus on character-based narrative where children must create the perspectives of the characters. The ability to tell stories is common to children from every community and can help them in school performance. Children should therefore be <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> express their understanding of character perspectives in oral storytelling. This thesis presents a tangible interface that allows children to practice pre-literacy skills using oral language. It introduces Dolltalk, a system that facilitates children's ability to take narrative perspectives through the mechanism of reporting speech. The toy presented works by asking children to tell stories and by playing back the stories to the child using narrative features. The ability to express the way the characters think and feel in a narrative and what motivates them to act {{has been shown to be}} predictive of academic competence among preschool children. A user study was conducted to understand the short-term effect of Dolltalk on children's elaboration of internal states of story characters. The results show that playing with Dolltalk <b>encourages</b> children <b>to</b> introduce their characters in the story and to express the internal states of their characters much more than with the use of a simple tape recorder. The results also show that playing with the current version of Dolltalk or with Dolltalk in tape-recorder mode <b>encourages</b> children <b>to</b> provide spatial and temporal information in their stories much more than they would without hearing any playback of their stories. This thesis presents significant results (p =. 04) that indicate the current version of Dolltalk <b>encourages</b> children <b>to</b> express the internal states of their characters. by Catherine N.

40|$|The present {{field study}} report {{comprises}} two major components: 1. {{the theories of}} autonomy and self-directed learning and the analysis of needs and reasons for increasing student autonomy. 2. some practical issues concerning acquisition of autonomy in E. F. L. learning. The modernization of China requires {{a high level of}} education of the whole nation. But because of the large population and limited educational facilities, the formal educational institutions cannot {{meet the needs of the}} country. To solve the problem, self-directed learning (S. D. L.) is recommended and encouraged by the government. Although S. D. L. is considered to be a practical way to cope with the situation, the problem is that most people do not know how to undertake independent study. The reason is that the dominance of traditional pedagogy in Chinese formal education leads to passive and dependent school learning which suppresses students' potential to become autonomous in their learning. Therefore, after leaving school, they are not capable of continuing their learning by themselves. In order to deal with the problems in traditional Chinese teaching, the significance of increasing student autonomy needs to be fully recognized in the Chinese educational context, and self-directed learning should be introduced to formal educational institutions. Some practical issues must be considered in undertaking S. D. L. in the E. F. L. context. First, the role of the teacher needs to be redefined. The teacher will primarily act as a counsellor and facilitator who will guide the students in their learning, and secondarily as a resource for content information. Secondly, S. D. L. materials need to be prepared. These materials will not only help to improve the students' language competence but also <b>encourage</b> them <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn.</b> This study discusses the types and sources of materials and suggests certain criteria and procedures for selecting and producing these materials. Thirdly, self-assessment is a central and crucial feature of S. D. L. In autonomous learning, it is the learner's responsibility to assess his own progress. In order to take this responsibility he needs to acquire self-assessment skills. Some techniques of self-assessment are introduced. Finally, in considering how to provide the learners with an effective learning environment, this study puts forward suggestions for establishing a self-study center. Some language skills and learning activities which can be practised in the center are also described...|$|R

Efektyvi priemonė, užkertanti kelią elgesio sutrikimams, yra prevencinė programa „Lubo iš Kosmoso!“, ugdanti ikimokyklinio amžiaus vaikų socialines ir emocines kompetencijas. Straipsnyje pristatoma šios prevencinės programos metodinė struktūra, palengvinanti vaikų darželio auklėtojų ar socialinių darbuotojų darbą. Our {{behavioral}} {{standards and}} limits {{are determined by}} the society in which we live, which also holds certain expectations regarding our conduct in the surrounding environment. Therefore, if we strive to live a full-fledged life in harmony with the surroundings, we need understand the significance of the role played by our skills and abilities in the field of communication and relations with other people. The ability to develop relationships and socialize is closely related to emotional skills. We could hardly be able to interact with each other successfully if we had developed no empathy, which is our ability to recognize and share feelings with the environment, another person or situation, or if we had failed <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> rationally control our emotions. It would be hard to start any relationships if we could not even understand our own feelings. The new studies confirm that emotional competencies are the basis for the development of proper social conduct (Petermann, Wiedebusch, 2003, based on Hillenbrand et al., 2009). The exposure of proper behavior requires more than just the possession of individual knowledge and skills in the field of socially competent behavior. One must also know how to use such information in each particular situation. Therefore, the core condition for socially competent behavior is the ability to properly understand the situation, evaluate and empathize with it as well as {{to be able to use}} self-control (Fydrich, Bürgener, 1999; Petermann, 1999). It is especially important to foster social and emotional skills at the beginning of their development, i. e. in their pre-school stage, to prevent behavioral disorders in children (Hillenbrand, Henneman, 2005). Most importantly, we should <b>encourage</b> children <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> understand their emotions and control them as well as develop the ability to empathize with others. Social employees and kindergarten teachers point out that this field especially lacks the methods and possibilities for an effective promotion of the development of social and emotional competencies, the demand for which is particularly high when working with the children from higher risk groups. The preventive program “Lubo from Outer Space!” supports positive behavior of children and facilitates the everyday life of children in kindergartens. The methods used in the program are based on the promotion of social and emotional competencies proven effective by scientific researches...|$|R

He received his undergraduate degree from Dartmouth and majored in International Relations. For graduate school, he applied to Tufts, Harvard, Columbia and SAIS. He came to SAIS because the school offered him money (as did Columbia). He chose SAIS mainly because he wanted to live in Washington, D. C. He went straight to SAIS from Dartmouth as that is commonly what people did then, but he also came {{as a result of the}} draft (Vietnam War) educational deferment helped him avoid the draft for two years. His first memories of SAIS include being in the new building on Massachusetts Avenue, across from the Brookings Institute. He recalls having trees around it and generally being in the midst of the international community. He also remembers SAIS not having a campus, but rather just being a building. He remembers the whole Dupont area was much rougher than it is today (and recalls the riots of 1968 being just passed 17 th Street down the road). He remembers Professor Sonenfeld (he received his degree in Soviet Studies) as well as Professors Liska, Holborn and Tucker. He remembers the oral exam being extremely challenging (but was glad that there was no thesis). He learned German while he was at SAIS (passed his Orals), but does not remember much of it today (he did practice it a bit, though, while he was visiting Switzerland a few years ago). He also remembers that Bill Nitze used to have a big party, one Saturday each year, where all students and faculty got together in his back yard. With regard to his career, he had every intention of going straight into the State Department after SAIS, but ended up doing something completely different. Due to the draft and because the State Department would not admit him from the list for two years (with the exception of a position with the Foreign Reserve in Vietnam), he took a part-time job with the U. S. Postal Service. He originally chose a job with the U. S. Postal Services due to the supreme quality of their training programs (and it was the best offer he had at the time) and though it would be difficult, it would allow him possible deferment. He wrote a long letter to the Selective Service explaining why he thought he would better serve his country by staying in his current job and not joining the infantry in Vietnam. The letter he got back was from General Hershey saying, Over my dead body. As that did not work, he sent the letter to his local draft board who then granted him occupational deferment. Interestingly, many of his friends tried to use the same letter and were not successful. After spending three years with the Postal Service, he decided to stay with them and has made a 30 -year career of it in the business and marketing units of the organization (using similar skill sets it all ties to Foreign Policy). He advises current students to keep an open mind and to not create self limits. He <b>encourages</b> them <b>to</b> see all the various options available given their various skill sets. Also, he <b>encourages</b> students <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> manage themselves, interpersonally, in a large organization (i. e. understand the expectations). ...|$|R
