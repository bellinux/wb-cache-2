6000|$|The Publican's shame therefore, {{which he}} demonstrateth that he had, even by hanging down of his head, was godly and holy, and {{much like that}} of the prodigal, when he said, [...] "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son." [...] (Luke 15:21) I suppose that his postures were much the same with the Publican's, as were his prayers, for the {{substance}} of them. O however grace did work in both to the same end, they were both of them, after a <b>godly</b> <b>manner</b> ashamed of their sins.|$|E
60|$|WISE. He did not. And if I be not mistaken, {{the reason}} why was this. There was godliness {{in the house of}} the first, and that young Badman could not endure. For fare, for lodging, for work, and time, he had better, and more by this master's allowance, than ever he had by his last; but all this would not content, because godliness was {{promoted}} there. He could not abide this praying, this reading of Scriptures, and hearing, and repeating of sermons; he could not abide to be told of his transgressions in a sober and <b>godly</b> <b>manner.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Thirdly, This thus done, {{let that}} man again {{consider}} thus with himself: Perhaps God is now changing of my Condition and {{state in the}} world; he has let me live in fashion, in fulness, and abundance of worldly glory, and I did not to his glory improve, as I should, that his good dispensation to me. {100a} But when I lived in full and fat pasture, I did there lift up the heel: Therefore he will now turn me into hard Commons, that with leanness, and hunger, and meanness, and want, I may {{spend the rest of}} my days. But let him do this without murmering, and repining; let him do it in a <b>godly</b> <b>manner,</b> submitting himself to the Judgment of God. Let the rich rejoyce in that he is made low. {100b} ...|$|E
60|$|But {{whether this}} {{or the other}} Christian knows it, God has his consolations for his {{suffering}} people; and those, too, such as are proportioned to the nature or degree of their sufferings; the which shall assuredly be made appear to them that shall after a <b>godly</b> <b>manner</b> stick to his truth, and trust him with their souls. Joseph was cast into prison; but God was with him. John was banished into the isle called Patmos, for the Word of God; but what revelations of God had he there! even such as he was a stranger to all his life before: this, therefore, is to be well heeded. For it is {{a demonstration of the}} faithfulness of God to those that, suffering according to his will, do commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator.|$|E

But when I lived in full and fat pasture, I did there lift up the heel (Deut 32:15). Therefore he will now turn me into hard commons, that with leanness, and hunger, and meanness, and want, I may {{spend the rest of}} my days.

6000|$|Now {{all these}} advantages, the {{children}} of ungodly Parents want; {84a} and so are more {{in danger of being}} carried away with the error of the wicked. For ungodly Parents neither Pray for their Children, nor do, nor can they heartily instruct them; they do not after a <b>godly</b> <b>manner</b> restrain them from evil, nor do they keep them from evil company. They are not grieved at, nor yet do they forewarn their children to beware of such evil actions that are abomination to God, and to all good men. They let their children break the Sabbath, swear, lye, be wicked and vain. They commend not to their children an holy life, nor set a good example before their eyes. No, they do in all things contrary: Estranging of their children what they can, from the love of God and all good men, so soon as they are born. Therefore it is a very great Judgment of God upon children to be the Offspring of base and ungodly men. {84b} ...|$|E
60|$|For it is {{possible}} for the carnal man to be beaten out of all his arguments for himself and his own things, by the power and force of the Word; and to be made to consent to what the Christian has said as to the notion of the truth. I must not speak this of all. But yet the breach doth still abide; for that yet {{there appears to be no}} more with the man, but only the notion of things. For though the notion of things are those that of God are made the means of conveying of grace into the heart, yet grace is not always with the notion of things; the Word ofttimes standeth in man's understanding alone, and remaineth there, as not being accompanied with such grace as can make it the power of God to salvation. Now, when it is thus with the soul, the danger is as great as ever, because there is a presumption now begotten in the heart that the man is in a saved condition,--a presumption, I say, instead of faith, which puffeth up, instead of enabling the soul after a <b>godly</b> <b>manner</b> to depend upon God for mercy through Christ. This is called the word of them that are puffed up; the word only, because not accompanied with saving grace (1 Cor 4:19; 8:1; 1 Thess 1:5).|$|E
60|$|Yea, shall I tell you, That baptism will neither admit a {{man into}} fellowship, nor keep him there, if he be a transgressor {{of a moral}} precept; and {{that a man who}} believeth in Jesus, and fulfilleth the royal law, doth more glorify God, and honour {{religion}} in the world, than he that keepeth, if there were so many, ten thousand figurative laws. As to those commands that respect God's instituted worship in a church, as a church, I have told you that baptism is none of them, and you have been driven to confess it. The church then must first look to faith, then to good living according to the ten commandments; after that she must respect those appointments of our Lord Jesus that respects her outward order and discipline, and then she walks as becomes her, sinning if she neglecteth either; sinning if she overvalueth either. But why did you not answer those tests I produced for the strengthening of my argument (Rom 14:17,18; Deut 27:47; James 2:8-12; 1 Cor 9:21, 5:9-11; Gal 6:15,16; Phil 3; 1 Tim 1:9-11; Acts 20:28-32; Rom 13:13; James 4:11; 1 Cor 5:12). Deal fairly; Answer those texts, with the argument made upon them; and when you have after a <b>godly</b> <b>manner</b> done that, you may the more boldly condemn.|$|E
50|$|The Secret of the Way Things Are (also {{called the}} Sapiential Work Scroll) is {{considered}} a wisdom scroll among the Dead Sea Scrolls. It is authored by a spiritual expert, directed towards a beginner. The author addresses {{how to deal with}} business and money issues in a <b>godly</b> <b>manner,</b> public affairs, leadership, marriage, children, and family, and how to live life righteously among secular society. The scrolls were found in Qumran caves one and four, and date approximately from the first century BCE and early first century CE.|$|E

5000|$|The Seventh Saturday of Pascha, the {{day before}} Pentecost, is a Saturday of the Dead, on which the church commemorates all of the {{faithful}} departed [...] "who in ages past have reposed in a <b>godly</b> <b>manner,</b> in hope of the resurrection of eternal life." [...] Two Epistles ( [...] , [...] ) and two Gospels ( [...] , [...] ) are appointed to be read at the Divine Liturgy. On this day, the readings from Acts and the Gospel of St. John, which began on Pascha, are concluded. Traditionally, St. John Chrysostom's homily [...] "On Patience and Gratitude" [...] is appointed to be read in church (the same homily is also appointed for funerals).|$|E
50|$|The {{uniqueness}} of à Brakel's work {{lies in the}} fact that it is more than a systematic theology. His selection of the title is already an indication that it was not merely his intention to present a systematic explanation of Christian dogma to the public. In selecting the words of Romans 12:1 as the basis for his title, à Brakel not only wished to indicate that it is an entirely reasonable matter for man to serve the God who has so graciously revealed Himself in His Son Jesus Christ by means of His Word, but he primarily wished to convey that God demands from man that he serve Him in spirit and in truth, doing so in an intelligent, reasonable, and <b>godly</b> <b>manner.</b>|$|E
