5|$|Back in the 1980s, the {{ideology}} of Hezbollah was described as radical. It {{is presented in the}} 1985 manifesto. The first objective was fighting against American and Israeli imperialism, freedom of the occupied Southern Lebanon and all other occupied territories. The second objective was to gather all Muslims in the concept of ummah; then Lebanon would continue the 1979 Revolution of Iran. It also declared it would protect all Lebanese communities except the ones which collaborated with Israel, and supported all national movements—Muslim or non-Muslim—throughout the world. The Ideology <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed,</b> and today Hezbollah is a left-wing political entity focused on social injustice.|$|E
5|$|Before the Treaty of Lisbon {{came into}} force, the {{executive}} {{power of the}} EU was held by the Council: it conferred on the Commission such powers for it to exercise. However, the Council was allowed to withdraw these powers, exercise them directly, or impose conditions on their use. This aspect <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> by the Treaty of Lisbon, after which the Commission exercises its powers just {{by virtue of the}} treaties. Powers are more restricted than most national executives, in part due to the Commission's lack of power over areas like foreign policy– that power is held by the European Council, which some analysts have described as another executive.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} organization into județe of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia (where {{they were}} termed ținuturi) {{dates back to}} at least the late 14th century. For {{most of the time}} since modern Romania was formed in 1859, the administrative division system has been similar to the French departments one. The system <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> several times since then, and the number of counties has varied over time, from the 71 județe that existed before World War II to only 39 after 1968.

5|$|The {{increase}} in maximum bandwidth {{is achieved by}} raising the lane speed from 6 Gbit/s to 12 Gbit/s and {{increasing the number of}} AV data lanes from 3 to 4 (i.e. using all 4 lanes to carry data). The data lanes runs in inverted clock mode and embeds the clock signal in itself. This allows the clock lane to be used for data (in addition to the existing three data lanes). The lane data structure <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> to a packet-based format. The lane encoding is changed from 8b/10b to 16b/18b (reducing the overhead from 20% to 11%).|$|E
5|$|To {{some degree}} the {{movement}} has been successful. Beginning in 1998, the official curriculum in Taiwan schools <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> to contain more frequent and favorable mention of aborigines. In 1996 the Council of Indigenous Peoples was promoted to a ministry-level rank within the Executive Yuan. The central government has taken steps to allow romanized spellings of aboriginal names on official documents, offsetting the long-held policy of forcing a Han name on an aborigine. A relaxed policy on identification now allows a child to choose their official designation if they are born to mixed aboriginal/Han parents.|$|E
