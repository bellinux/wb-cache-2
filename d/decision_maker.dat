40|$|Three {{experimental}} studies are reported, {{the first two}} of which explore differences in advisors’ and decision makers’ preferences, and differences in personal decisions in the near and the distant future. It was expected that preferences of advisors would be more {{similar to those of}} distant future <b>decision</b> <b>makers</b> than of near future <b>decision</b> <b>makers.</b> This prediction was supported. In Experiment 1, advisors (both pure advisors and <b>decision</b> <b>makers</b> for others) and distant future <b>decision</b> <b>makers</b> made more action choices than near future <b>decision</b> <b>makers,</b> thus only for low life-impact situations. In Experiment 2 advisors and distant future <b>decision</b> <b>makers</b> made more desirability choices than near future <b>decision</b> <b>makers.</b> These results indicate some similarities in representation of the decision problem due to a psychological distance to the event, which construal level theory could account for.

5|$|When the {{government}} seeks to burden a person's protected liberty interest or property interest, the Supreme Court has held that procedural due process requires that, at a minimum, {{the government}} provide the person notice, {{an opportunity to}} be heard at an oral hearing, and a decision by a neutral <b>decision</b> <b>maker.</b> For example, such process is due when a government agency seeks to terminate civil service employees, expel a student from public school, or cut off a welfare recipient's benefits. The Court has also ruled that the Due Process Clause requires judges to recuse themselves in cases where the judge has a conflict of interest. For example, in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. (2009), the Court ruled that a justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia had to recuse himself from a case involving a major contributor to his campaign for election to that court.|$|E
25|$|Visualization of the Pareto {{front is}} one of the a posteriori {{preference}} techniques of multi-objective optimization. The a posteriori preference techniques (see, for example,) provide an important class of multi-objective optimization techniques. Usually the a posteriori preference techniques include four steps: (1) computer approximates the Pareto front, i.e. the Pareto optimal set in the objective space; (2) the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> studies the Pareto front approximation; (3) the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> identifies the preferred point at the Pareto front; (4) computer provides the Pareto optimal decision, which output coincides with the objective point identified by the <b>decision</b> <b>maker.</b> From {{the point of view of}} the <b>decision</b> <b>maker,</b> the second step of the a posteriori preference techniques is the most complicated one. There are two main approaches to informing the <b>decision</b> <b>maker.</b> First, a number of points of the Pareto front can be provided in the form of a list (interesting discussion and references are given in) or using Heatmaps.|$|E

25|$|Bayesian {{decision}} theory {{can be applied}} to all four areas of the marketing mix. Assessments are made by a <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> on the probabilities of events that determine the profitability of alternative actions where the outcomes are uncertain. Assessments are also made for the profit (utility) for each possible combination of action and event. The <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> can decide how much research, if any, needs to be conducted in order to investigate the consequences associated with the courses of action under evaluation. This is done before a final decision is made, but {{it should be noted that}} in order to do this costs would be incurred, time used and may overall be unreliable. For each possible action, expected profit can be computed, that is a weighted mean of the possible profits, the weights being the probabilities. The <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> can then choose the action for which the expected profit is the highest. The theorem provides a formal reconciliation between judgment expressed quantitatively in the prior distribution and the statistical evidence of the experiment.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, a fourth type of {{generating}} {{a small sample}} of solutions is included in and. An example of interactive method utilizing trade-off information is the Zionts-Wallenius method, where the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> is shown several objective trade-offs at each iteration, and (s)he is expected to say whether (s)he likes, dislikes or is indifferent with respect to each trade-off. In reference point based methods (see e.g.), the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> is expected at each iteration to specify a reference point consisting of desired values for each objective and a corresponding Pareto optimal solution(s) is then computed and shown to him/her for analysis. In classification based interactive methods, the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> is assumed to give preferences in the form of classifying objectives at the current Pareto optimal solution into different classes indicating how the values of the objectives should be changed to get a more preferred solution. Then, the classification information given is taken into account when new (more preferred) Pareto optimal solution(s) are computed. In the satisficing trade-off method (STOM) three classes are used: objectives whose values 1) should be improved, 2) can be relaxed, and 3) are acceptable as such.

25|$|In {{the case}} of bi-objective problems, informing the <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> {{concerning}} the Pareto front is usually carried out by its visualization: the Pareto front, often named the tradeoff curve in this case, can be drawn at the objective plane.

The <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> takes this information into account while specifying the preferred Pareto optimal objective point. The idea to approximate and visualize the Pareto front was introduced for linear bi-objective decision problems by S.Gass and T.Saaty.
