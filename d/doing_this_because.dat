25|$|He was {{archbishop}} for 42 years, unparalleled in Sweden, {{and during}} his time he was often in conflicts with the monarchs. In 1539 his brother Olaus {{was sentenced to death}} by the King over some arguments, and Laurentius was among those forced to sign the death sentence. It has been disputed whether Laurentius was <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> of a weak character or if he thought it better to formally obey so that he could continue to spread the reformation ideas. Olaus did eventually get pardoned in 1542, much due to his influential friends, but he was forced to keep a low profile, leaving the role of main reformator solely to Laurentius.|$|E

On the [...] "Token Skeptic" [...] podcast Michael Marshall said, [...] "How we try to always pitch it and how we try and run it is - it's all about the skeptical community. Because its being run by people who are just part of that community who are <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> we really love it, the atmosphere, seems to be, of people coming together. It's kind of a big party, a celebration of UK skepticism and also international skepticism".|$|E

The normal pressure level used for launch ( [...] above ambient) created sufficient force to prevent removing the cover until the excess pressure was vented. Emergency procedure called for Grissom {{to open the}} cabin vent valve first, allowing White to remove the cover, but Grissom was prevented from <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> the valve was located to the left, behind the initial wall of flames. Also, while the system could easily vent the normal pressure, its flow capacity was utterly incapable of handling the rapid increase to [...] absolute caused by the intense heat of the fire.|$|E

The network was launched March 31, 2004. Originally named The O'Franken Factor but renamed The Al Franken Show on July 12, 2004, the show aired three hours a day, {{five days a week}} for three years. The stated goal of the show was to provide the public airwaves with more progressive views to counter what Franken perceived was the dominance of conservative syndicated commentary on the radio: [...] "I'm <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> I want to use my energies to get Bush unelected," [...] he told a New York Times reporter in 2004. Franken's last radio show on Air America Radio was on February 14, 2007, {{at the end of which}} he announced his candidacy for the United States Senate.|$|E
500|$|Williams's role in AC/DC was {{to provide}} steady but basic bass lines which {{followed}} the rhythm guitar of Malcolm Young, consisting mostly of eighth notes. His basslines were sometimes written by Malcolm and Angus Young during composition, {{and at other times}} Williams developed them based on the other instrumental tracks. Williams said he plays [...] "the same thing in every song, for the most part. In AC/DC's music, the song is more important than any individual's bit in it." [...] He added that [...] "complex [...] lines wouldn't add anything to a guitar-oriented band like ours, so I try to create a bottom layer that drives what our guys are doing on top." [...] Williams had no difficulty keeping his low profile within the band, declaring that [...] "I don't have any problem <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> I enjoy playing simply. I never feel angry or prisoner." [...] His playing technique was mostly centred around downpicking, with occasional use of plucking to mute the strings, which he says [...] "adds more definition and tightens up the notes, and it gives the sound less sustain".|$|E

2500|$|... 3 January, Ahlu Sunna Waljamaa {{official}} Sheikh Abdi Badel Sheikh Abdullahi, {{complained about}} Ethiopian {{forces in the}} town of Dolo, in Gedo region. The town is controlled by 300 ASWJ and TFG forces, but it is also home to several Ethiopian military bases. Ethiopian forces had called on ASWJ fighters in the district to lay down their arms. According to a TFG official, three Ethiopian commanders had then come to the town of Dolo and ordered TFG forces to disarm. Ethiopian troops then disarmed a number of TFG and ASWJ forces. Sheikh Abdullahi alleged that Ethiopian forces were <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> they were outraged by ASWJ's military capability.|$|E
2500|$|Geiger and Marsden then {{wanted to}} {{estimate}} {{the total number of}} alpha particles that were being reflected. [...] The previous setup was unsuitable for <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> the tube contained several radioactive substances (radium plus its decay products) and thus the alpha particles emitted had varying ranges, and because it was difficult for them to ascertain at what rate the tube was emitting alpha particles. [...] This time, they placed a small quantity of radium C (bismuth-214) on the lead plate, which bounced off a platinum reflector (R) and onto the screen. [...] They found that {{only a tiny fraction of}} the alpha particles that struck the reflector bounced onto the screen (in this case, 1 in 8000).|$|E
2500|$|Many {{speculative}} individuals want {{to express}} their opinion about {{the mysteries of the}} Christian religion and the nature of sin and guilt. Kierkegaard warns against <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> [...] "the most dangerous condition is that of the one who is deceived by much knowledge," [...] knowing is one thing, doing another. [...] "If anyone has the task of preaching or teaching others about their guilt, of teaching-something that this discourse, which is without authority, does not do-he does have the consolation that the purest heart is precisely the one most willing to comprehend his own guilt most deeply." [...] Kierkegaard asked every single individual these questions in his 1847 book, Works of Love in an effort to show how useless it is to compare sin for sin and guilt for guilt.|$|E

2500|$|On December 25, 1989, Bernstein {{conducted}} Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in East Berlin's Schauspielhaus {{as part of}} {{a celebration}} of the fall of the Berlin Wall. He had conducted the same work in West Berlin the previous day. The concert was broadcast live in more than twenty countries to an estimated audience of 100 million people. For the occasion, Bernstein reworded Friedrich Schiller's text of the Ode to Joy, substituting the word Freiheit (freedom) for [...] Freude (joy). Bernstein, in his spoken introduction, said that they had [...] "taken the liberty" [...] of <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> of a [...] "most likely phony" [...] story, apparently believed in some quarters, that Schiller wrote an [...] "Ode to Freedom" [...] that is now presumed lost. Bernstein added, [...] "I'm sure that Beethoven would have given us his blessing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 638, {{after the}} conquest of Syria, Umar {{dismissed}} Khalid because of his ever-growing fame and influence. He was quoted as <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> he wanted the {{people to know that}} victory came from God, not the general. [...] The military conquests were partially terminated between 638 and 639 during the years of great famine in Arabia and plague in Levant. During his reign the Levant, Egypt, Cyrenaica, Tripolitania, Fezzan, Eastern Anatolia, almost the whole of the Sassanid Persian Empire including Bactria, Persia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Caucasus and Makran were annexed to the Rashidun Caliphate. According to one estimate more than 4,050 cities were captured during these military conquests. Prior to his death in 644, Umar had ceased all military expeditions apparently to consolidate his rule in recently conquered Roman Egypt and the newly conquered Sassanid Empire (642–644). At his death in November 644, his rule extended from present day Libya in the west to the Indus river in the east and the Oxus river in the north.|$|E
2500|$|During the Secret Empire storyline, the Ultron/Hank Pym {{had set up}} a base in a {{unidentified}} forest. Upon being alerted by {{the approach}} of Sam Wilson's task force by a robot version of Edwin Jarvis, the Ultron/Hank Pym decides to give his [...] "family" [...] a warm welcome. When Tony Stark A.I.'s team and Captain America's team confront each other, they are captured by the Ultron/Hank Pym who forces both teams to sit at a dinner table. The Ultron/Hank Pym argues that he is <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> the Avengers have become less of a family over the years as so many of them jump to obey Captain America or Iron Man despite past experience confirming that this should be a bad idea, but the Tony Stark A.I. counters that the only reason the team failed as a family was because of Hank Pym's attack on Wasp. Outraged, the Ultron/Hank Pym nearly attacks the other heroes, but Scott Lang is able to talk him down by arguing that Hank Pym remains his own inspiration. The Ultron/Hank Pym allows the Tony Stark A.I.'s team to leave with the fragment, arguing that he will leave Captain America's plans with Hydra alone as it appears to be the best chance for world peace.|$|E
