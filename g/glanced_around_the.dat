60|$|Mr. Fanshawe <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> saloon {{and lowered}} his voice.|$|E
60|$|Geraldine <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{room to be}} {{sure that}} they were alone.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bullsom <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room. The two maid-servants {{were at the}} sideboard.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll be takin' some bit {{things that}} yon Whistlecrankie left," [...] said the gillie gravely, with a stolid <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room.|$|R
6000|$|Wiles started, cast a rapid <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> group, saw {{in a flash}} {{that the}} metal was unknown to them,--and then said quietly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but he {{said you}} were to meet him there," [...] {{continued}} Markham, <b>glancing</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> empty room with a slight expression of relief.|$|R
60|$|The woman smiled again, and <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> bare {{walls of}} the room.|$|E
60|$|I <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room. We were {{absolutely}} alone, but I dropped my voice.|$|E
60|$|Dr. Ballingford <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{table and}} was rewarded by nods and smiles of approval.|$|E
60|$|A <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room {{showed that}} the men had flown, and for good, for two valises which had stood in a corner were missing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am here to}} see you out of the house," [...] Macheson answered, {{with one}} breathless <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room. [...] "Will you come quietly?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Roberts, disconsolately: [...] "Oh, I suppose we'd better try. It can't be much worse." [...] He casts {{a hopeless}} <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{confused}} and tumbled room.|$|R
60|$|Josephine {{accepted}} the easy-chair which he wheeled {{up for her}} and <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room critically.|$|E
60|$|More at her ease now she <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{room and}} back at him. He smiled.|$|E
60|$|It {{suddenly}} {{occurred to}} Honora, as she <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> yacht, that Mrs. Rindge rather haunted her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perfectly, sir," [...] he answered, {{after one}} more rapid <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> carriage. [...] "I {{see that you}} are not {{concerned}} in this affair. I wish you good-night!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I ain't tickled {{to death}} about it. Home!" [...] with a scornful <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room, barren of all comforts. [...] "A graveyard's a more cheerful place, to my notion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{what you}} young gentlemen have been saying, I should judge {{that you know}} {{something}} concerning Brown and Martell," [...] went on the young teacher, with a <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> crowd.|$|R
60|$|Hebblethwaite <b>glanced</b> <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> {{throng of}} people had cleared off to watch the {{concluding}} stages of the match.|$|E
60|$|He was {{surprised}} at the girl's quick comprehension, for she <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> luxurious room with a faint smile.|$|E
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room. Our hands fell apart. I lit a {{cigarette}} and looked at the open trunk.|$|E
60|$|With {{his face}} still turned away {{he lifted the}} cup to his {{chattering}} teeth. When he had drained it he threw a trembling <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room and at the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you can do," [...] Teddy replied, mournfully, {{speaking}} in an ordinary tone. Then, <b>glancing</b> <b>around,</b> <b>the</b> policeman noticed that his prisoner was holding {{a conversation with a}} seeming friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let's go {{back now}} and have supper, and be sensible," [...] she said crisply. [...] "Rachel, your father is coming, too. He is coming to STAY,"--with a defiant <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> circle. [...] "Come, everybody." ...|$|R
60|$|She had {{not thought}} of Clarence. She turned hurriedly, <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room, and then peered down the dark stairway.|$|E
60|$|Draconmeyer's manner {{became more}} mysterious. He <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room {{as though to}} be sure that they were not overheard.|$|E
60|$|There was a stir at this, and Hodder {{paused a}} moment and <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> table. But no one interrupted.|$|E
6000|$|... "I would I knew!" [...] he {{answered}} quickly, casting a keen but hurried <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> whole horizon. [...] "It is not improbable {{that they should}} reach the shore. Four-and-twenty hours of calm will assure it." ...|$|R
60|$|Susan--or Nan Shelley--sat {{for a time}} in thought. Once in a {{while she}} would cast a furtive <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room and its wall covered with trophies, and then she would turn to Sarah Judd's placid face.|$|R
60|$|The sub-mother {{looked out}} of the window, which opened upon {{little more than the}} once husband-sheltering apple-tree, and then, after a general <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room, she looked at me, {{and for the first time}} {{addressed}} me.|$|R
60|$|Granet silently obeyed. Sir Alfred <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room. There was no {{possible}} hiding-place, {{not the slightest}} chance of being overheard.|$|E
60|$|I {{walked down}} the street and left him looking after me. At the corner I <b>glanced</b> <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> {{proprietor}} and the commissionnaire were talking together on the pavement.|$|E
6000|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{room for}} a moment or two, as though {{interested}} in the people. Satisfied at last that there was no chance of being overheard, he continued: ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Von Tassen <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> at <b>the</b> {{three men}} and made up his mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thy {{name is not}} in much favour apparently, Herr MÃ¼ller, or Herr Balthazar, {{whichever}} it is thy {{pleasure to}} be called," [...] observed the Genoese, casting a quick <b>glance</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> circle. [...] "There is some mystery in it, that to me needs explanation." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>glanced</b> <b>around</b> at <b>the</b> little army of {{servants}} moving noiselessly {{about on}} all sides.|$|R
