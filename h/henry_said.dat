5|$|In {{the middle}} of this confrontation, Henry {{unexpectedly}} fell ill and died near Lyons-la-Forêt. It is uncertain what, if anything, <b>Henry</b> <b>said</b> about the succession before his death. Contemporary chronicler accounts were coloured by subsequent events. Sources favourable to Matilda suggested that Henry had reaffirmed his intent to grant all his lands to his daughter, while hostile chroniclers argued that Henry had renounced his former plans and had apologised for having forced the barons to swear an oath of allegiance to her.|$|E
25|$|Henry was in France {{with the}} Emperor Maximilian at {{the siege of}} Thérouanne. The Scottish Lyon King of Arms brought James IV's letter of 26 July to him. James asked him to desist from attacking France in breach of their treaty. Henry's {{exchange}} with Islay Herald or the Lyon King on 11 August at his tent at the siege was recorded. The Herald declared that Henry should abandon his efforts against the town and go home. Angered, <b>Henry</b> <b>said</b> that James {{had no right to}} summon him, and ought to be England's ally, as James was married to his (Henry's) sister, Margaret. He declared:And now, for a conclusion, recommend me to your master and tell him if he be so hardy to invade my realm or cause to enter one foot of my ground I shall make him as weary of his part as ever was man that began any such business. And one thing I ensure him by the faith that I have to the Crown of England and by the word of a King, there shall never King nor Prince make peace with me that ever his part shall be in it. Moreover, fellow, I care for nothing but for misentreating of my sister, that would God she were in England on a condition she cost the Schottes King not a penny.|$|E

500|$|The French team {{struggled}} {{during the}} 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and {{finished second in}} their group behind Serbia. During the play-offs against the Republic of Ireland, Henry {{was involved in a}} controversy in the second leg of the game at the Stade de France on 18 November 2009. With the aggregate score tied at 1–1 and the game in extra time, he used his hand twice to control the ball before delivering a cross to William Gallas who scored the winner. This sparked a barrage of criticism against the Frenchman, while national team coach Raymond Domenech and Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger defended him. The Football Association of Ireland lodged a formal complaint with FIFA, seeking a replay of the game, which FIFA declined. <b>Henry</b> <b>said</b> that he contemplated retiring from international football after the reactions to the incident, but maintained that he was not a [...] "cheat"; hours after FIFA had ruled out a replay, he stated that [...] "the fairest solution would be to replay the game". FIFA President Sepp Blatter described the incident as [...] "blatant unfair play" [...] and announced an inquiry into how such incidents could be avoided in future, and added that the incident would be investigated by the Disciplinary Committee. Blatter also said Henry told him that his family had been threatened {{in the aftermath of the}} incident. In January 2010, FIFA announced that there was no legal basis to sanction Henry.|$|E
500|$|In 1173 {{and early}} 1174 Geoffrey fought a {{military}} campaign in northern England {{in support of}} his father's attempts to subdue the Scots, who were supporting the rebellion by Geoffrey's legitimate half-brothers against their father. The campaign resulted in the capture of William the Lion, the King of Scots, at the Battle of Alnwick and also helped to compel Hugh du Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, to pledge fealty to Henry II. During the campaign, Geoffrey captured several castles held by Roger Mowbray, a supporter of the Scottish king. It was after this campaign that <b>Henry</b> <b>said</b> of Geoffrey [...] "My other sons are the real bastards. ... This is the only one who's proved himself legitimate!" [...] After Geoffrey was confirmed as bishop by Pope Alexander in 1175, the bishop-elect made a ceremonial visit to Lincoln on 1 August 1175. He subsequently went to study at Tours, where he probably befriended Peter of Blois, a medieval poet and diplomat who dedicated a later work on St Wilfrid to Geoffrey. The bishop-elect made several gifts to the cathedral at Lincoln, including two bells for the bell tower. While Geoffrey was the bishop-elect at Lincoln, it appears that Adam, Bishop of St Asaph, carried out the episcopal duties in the diocese of Lincoln, as Geoffrey had not been consecrated and was unable to perform those functions. Nevertheless, he managed to recover some lands of the diocese that had been lost as well as redeeming pawned ecclesiastical items. Although he aided the finances of his diocese with these recoveries, in 1180 he taxed his diocese heavily enough to earn him a rebuke from his father. In 1181 Pope Lucius III became concerned that Geoffrey {{was never going to be}} ordained or consecrated, and demanded that the bishop-elect's position be regularised, either through consecration as bishop or through resignation.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Henry</b> <b>said</b> {{that he had}} {{considered}} quitting international football after the reactions to the incident, but was persuaded not to by friends and family. He criticised the French Football Federation (FFF) for their lack of support {{in the aftermath of}} the controversy. He regretted the immediate celebration of the goal but put it down to the emotion of the moment, and reflected that not informing the referee had been a mistake. On the issue of lasting impact of the incident, <b>Henry</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I don't think that all I have achieved in my career up until now will be spoiled by this".|$|E

2500|$|As {{a famous}} {{scientist}} {{and director of}} the Smithsonian Institution, Henry received visits from other scientists and inventors who sought his advice. Henry was patient, kindly, self-controlled, and gently humorous. One such visitor was Alexander Graham Bell, who on 1 March 1875 carried a letter of introduction to Henry. Henry showed an interest in seeing Bell's experimental apparatus, and Bell returned the following day. After the demonstration, Bell mentioned his untested theory on how to transmit human speech electrically by means of a [...] "harp apparatus" [...] which would have several steel reeds tuned to different frequencies to cover the voice spectrum. <b>Henry</b> <b>said</b> Bell had [...] "the germ of a great invention". Henry advised Bell not to publish his ideas until he had perfected the invention. When Bell objected that he lacked the necessary knowledge, Henry firmly advised: [...] "Get it!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Once the {{recordings}} went public erupting in a media scandal, Hogan {{apologized for the}} remarks, which he said is [...] "language that is offensive and inconsistent with [...] own beliefs".

Virgil commented [...] "Hogan has never given me a reason to believe he is a racist" [...] while Dennis Rodman said he [...] "most certainly is not a racist" [...] and Kamala added [...] "I do not think Hogan meant harm by saying that. Hogan is my brother until he decides not to be". Black wrestlers working in the WWE made different comments. Mark <b>Henry</b> <b>said</b> he was pleased by WWE's [...] "no tolerance approach to racism" [...] response, and that he was hurt and offended by Hogan's manner and tone. Booker T said he was shocked and called the statements unfortunate.|$|E
2500|$|On 17 May 2004, van Persie {{signed a}} {{four-year}} deal with Arsenal for £2.75million, {{just over half}} of Feyenoord's original asking price of £5million. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger, who planned to convert van Persie from a left winger to a centre forward as he had successfully done with star player Thierry <b>Henry,</b> <b>said</b> of his new acquisition, [...] "He can play {{on the left side}} of midfield, as a creative player behind the main strikers or as a target man." [...] Arsenal had further padded their stable of strikers in January by signing Spanish forward José Antonio Reyes, leaving the two to battle for playing time. Van Persie made his debut and won a trophy in the process, as he came on as a substitute in the 3–1 FA Community Shield victory over Manchester United on 8 August 2004. Van Persie spent most of his time on the bench during earlier parts of the 2004–05 season, and made his competitive debut on 27 October by scoring Arsenal's opening goal in a 2–1 League Cup win over Manchester City.|$|E
2500|$|At the 83rd minute, {{with the}} score at 1–1, referee Roberto Rosetti called a foul against Spain's Carles Puyol. France's Thierry Henry went down holding his face, {{although}} Puyol appeared {{to hit him}} in the chest. Patrick Vieira scored from the resulting free kick and France won the match 3–1. [...] "For me it wasn't a foul, if anything it was a foul by (Henry) because he came from behind and collided with me," [...] Puyol said, [...] "but referees can get things wrong." [...] Spain coach Luis Aragonés also called the foul [...] "non-existent". But <b>Henry</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Puyol came up to me afterwards and apologised so how is that cheating?" [...] He also told reporters, [...] "Look at the replay, their left-back was going to take the ball and Puyol came across me and blocked me. If that's basketball that's a good block, but we're not playing basketball. In my head I'm not a guy who does go down or cheats." [...] Television announcer and former Netherlands international Ruud Gullit said of the play, [...] "I am a little bit disappointed. It shows that cheating works." ...|$|E

The Oklahoma House of Representatives failed to confirm the choice after Rep. Mike Reynolds, R-Oklahoma City attacked the band for its use of offensive language, and Rep.

However, that evening Oklahoma governor Brad Henry announced he would sign an executive order naming the song the official rock song. <b>Henry</b> <b>said</b> that for more than 20 years the Flaming Lips have produced [...] "creative, fun and provocative rock music."
