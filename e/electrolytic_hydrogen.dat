40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{and compares}} the economics and sustainability aspects of two hydrogenation processes for producing renewable methanol and ammonia by using wind-power based <b>electrolytic</b> <b>hydrogen.</b> Carbon dioxide from an ethanol plant {{is used for}} producing methanol, while the nitrogen is supplied by an Air Separation Unit (ASU) for producing ammonia. The capacities are 99. 96 mt/day methanol and 1202. 55 mt/day anhydrous ammonia. The methanol plant requires 138. 37 mt CO 2 /day and 19. 08 mt H 2 /day. The ammonia is synthesized by using 217. 72 mt H 2 /day and 1009. 15 mt N 2 /day. The production costs and the carbon equivalent emissions (CO 2 e) associated with the methanol and ammonia processes, <b>electrolytic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> production, carbon capture and compression, and ASU are estimated. The integral facilities of both the methanol and ammonia productions are evaluated by introducing a multi-criteria decision matrix containing economics and sustainability metrics. Discounted cash flow diagrams are established to estimate the economic constraints, unit product costs, and unit costs of hydrogen. The hydrogen cost is the largest contributor to {{the economics of the}} plants. For the methanol, the values of emissions are - 0. 85 kg CO 2 e/kg methanol as a chemical feedstock and + 0. 53 kg CO 2 e/kg methanol as a fuel with complete combustion.

40|$|Power-to-gas (PtG) is an {{emerging}} energy storage concept, which can transfer the surplus and intermittent renewable generated power into a marketable hydrogen, {{as well as}} providing other ancillary services for the electrical grid. In the case of Ontario, excess power is encountered during periods of low electricity demand as a result of substantial generation from baseload nuclear and increasing integration of intermittent renewable sources powering the electrical grid. This thesis develops various simulation and analysis of Ontario’s energy system to illustrate the use of PtG when its <b>electrolytic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> is employed in the gasoline production cycle to reduce the carbon intensity of the production process, and increase the renewable content of this traditional transportation fuel. The work includes a case study for a simulated refinery to evaluate the production cost and life cycle emission for different production scenarios, related to the deployment of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers to meet the refinery demand of hydrogen. Moreover, the study involves examining the use of the province surplus baseload generation (SBG) for which currently results in net exports to neighboring jurisdictions, and curtailed power generation capacity from wind and nuclear to meet the overall demand of the refining industry. Furthermore, a comparative assessment is conducted of blending 10 % corn-ethanol and using <b>electrolytic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> supply via PtG on the ‘well to wheel’ (WTW) impacts of gasoline fuel, according to the metrics of total energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and criteria air pollutants. According to the study, it is found that steam methane reforming (SMR) provides a lower cost hydrogen {{as a result of the}} current low natural gas prices, even with stringent carbon-pricing policy. However, the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> production shows a potential to curb significant carbon emissions as a substitute for SMR hydrogen. At a single refinery level, the use of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> can be compared to eliminating as many as 35, 000 gasoline passenger vehicles from the road when there is an installation of 130 PEM electrolyzer units (1 MW nameplate capacity per unit). Also, the analysis shows that PtG has the potential to supply the refineries within the province with the entire hydrogen demand with a fraction of the surplus power, particularly when making use of available seasonal storage at least for the next four years. Moreover, PtG is found to decrease 4. 6 % of the natural gas consumption on the gasoline cycle, and increase the renewable content of gasoline by extending the utilization of wind and hydro power. Furthermore, the deployment of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> results in minimizing gasoline carbon intensity by 0. 5 gCO 2 e per MJ of the fuel. When associated with the annual gasoline sales in Ontario, it can offer the reduction of 0. 26 Megaton of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions yearly. Moreover, PtG may contribute to lowering VOCs, NOx, PM 10 and PM 2. 5 criteria air pollutants from gasoline cycle, which cannot be achieved with blending corn based ethanol.

To achieve this potential, society will have to develop the necessary infrastructure to supply hydrogen to the fuel-cell vehicles. Hydrogen could be stored directly on the vehicle, or it could be derived from methanol or other hydrocarbon fuels by on-board chemical reformation. This infrastructure analysis assumes high-pressure (5, 000 psi) hydrogen on-board storage.

40|$|There {{are several}} {{hydrogen}} production technologies. They {{range from the}} most widely used fossil fuel based systems such as natural gas steam methane reforming to the least used renewable energy based systems such as wind electrolysis. Currently almost all the industrial hydrogen need worldwide is produced using fossil fuels. <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> production based on electricity generated from renewable resources and hydrogen's energetic use could contribute to the global need for a sustainable energy supply. However, these technologies are also not free from environmental burdens. A life cycle assessment (LCA) helps to identify such impacts considering the entire life cycle of the process chains. This paper reviews twenty-one studies that address the LCA of hydrogen production technologies, a majority of them employing electrolytic technologies. It has been observed that global warming potential (GWP) is the impact category analyzed by almost all the authors. Acidification potential (AP) ranks second. Other categories such as toxicity potential are often not analyzed. The main environmental concern associated with <b>electrolytic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> production is electricity supply. The GWP contribution of the electrolyzer unit is relatively small (e. g. only about 4 % in wind based electrolysis including hydrogen production and storage systems).

40|$|The {{diffusion}} of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> through membranes of pure iron, and two iron-carbon alloys has been investigated. In the initial experiments diffusion coefficients for <b>electrolytic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> in iron membranes {{have been obtained}} using a refined time-lag technique. Results showed an initial fast diffusion followed by a secondary slower stage. The initial stage yields diffusion coefficients which agree closely with extrapolated high temperature values (2 to 5. 5 x 10 - 5 cm 2 sec- 1); the second stage yields considerably lower coefficients (1 to 3 x 10 - 6 cm 2 sec- 1) which vary with membrane thickness. Results indicate {{the formation of a}} barrier to hydrogen flow as diffusion proceeds. Calculation of the effective barrier thickness enables the correction of apparent coefficients reported in the literature and quantitatively predicts the anomalous thickness effect. Further experiments using a more sophisticated experimental technique yield electrochemical constants for the hydrogen discharge and entry mechanism (transfer coefficients alpha 1 = 3 / 4 and alpha 2 = 1 / 2). Overpotential measurements indicate that the barrier may be identified with the formation of adsorbed hydrogen on the membrane surface. Reaction of oxygen with the adsorbed layer is responsible for occurrence of the secondary diffusion effect. The temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient and permeability has been determined as: D= 4. 91 x 10 - 4 exp (- 1450 /RT) cm 2 sec and D = 1. 3 x 10 - 3 exp (- 5600 /RT) cm 2 sec- 1, respectively.
