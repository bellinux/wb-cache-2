5|$|Seaborg {{remained}} at the University of California, Berkeley, for post-doctoral research. He followed Frederick Soddy's work investigating isotopes {{and contributed to the}} discovery of more than 100 isotopes of elements. Using one of Lawrence's advanced cyclotrons, John Livingood, Fred Fairbrother, and Seaborg created a new isotope of iron, iron-59 (Fe-59) in 1937. Iron-59 was useful <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> of the hemoglobin in human blood. In 1938, Livingood and Seaborg collaborated (as they did for five years) to create an important isotope of iodine, iodine-131 (I-131), which is still used to treat thyroid disease. (Many years later, it was credited with prolonging the life of Seaborg's mother.) As a result of these and other contributions, Seaborg is regarded as a pioneer in nuclear medicine and is one of its most prolific discoverers of isotopes.|$|E

25|$|Facilitation of {{non-native}} species, {{either by}} native species or other non-native species, {{may increase the}} invasibility of a community, or {{the ease with which}} non-native species become established in a community. In an examination of 254 published studies of introduced species, 22 of 190 interactions studied between introduced species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> were facilitative. It is worth noting that 128 of the 190 examined interactions were predator–prey relationships of a single plant-eating insect reported in a single study, which may have overemphasized the importance of negative interactions. Introduced plants are also facilitated by native pollinators, dispersers, and mycorrhizae. Thus, positive interactions must be considered in any attempt to understand the invasibility of a community.|$|E

25|$|Heightened brain {{plasticity}} in infants impacts later language development.

Participants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> who had transient language exposure as an infant or were multilingual showed greater brain activation in non-verbal working memory patterns, compared to monolingual speakers. The measure of uncommitted neural circuitry in infants can be accounted for {{in the perception of}} nonnative language at early stages of language acquisition. Research has shown that infants who show proficiency in nonnative phonetic perception at 7 months have slower language development than those who show proficiency in native phonetic perception. This research supports the Native Language Magnet/Neural Commitment Theory originally proposed by Patricia K. Kuhl.|$|E
25|$|Experimental method: This {{method is}} an {{experimental}} paradigm {{used to study}} human experiences involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> of sensation and perception, learning and memory, motivation, and biological psychology. The experimental psychologist usually deals with intact organisms although studies are often conducted with organisms modified by surgery, radiation, drug treatment, or long-standing deprivations of various kinds or with organisms that naturally present organic abnormalities or emotional disorders. Economists and psychologists have developed a variety of experimental methodologies to elicit and assess individual attitudes where each emotion differs for each individual. The results are then gathered and quantified to conclude if specific experiences have any common factors. This method is used to seek clarity of the experience and remove any biases to help understand the meaning behind the experience {{to see if it}} can be generalized.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{proposals for}} the Industrial Highway in Middlesex and Monmouth Counties {{date back to}} 1956, when officials from both counties brought forth {{a plan for a}} new industrial highway from Route18 in East Brunswick eastward to Route35 in Matawan. The proposal was then submitted by local authorities to then-state senator John Lynch. The proposal was turned into a bill and turned over the New Jersey State Legislature, who passed it in January 1962. From studies performed by Parsons Brinckerhoff in 1966 and 1967, the Route74 Freeway was to serve the need for an eastwest expressway on the area south of the Raritan River. The area covered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> showed that by 1985, the amount of parkland, industry and community size would grow by 150%.
