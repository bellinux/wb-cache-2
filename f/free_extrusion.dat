40|$|ABSTRACT. ‘Extrusion flow ’ {{describes}} any {{velocity field}} where maximum horizontal velocity occurs below the surface. By 1914, viscous flow and basal sliding over rough beds were accepted concepts. Between the world wars, {{there was little}} communication between naturalists describing complicated ice sheets, and physicists studying fundamental processes controlling flow. Max Demorest brought concepts from mechanics into glaciology and glacial geology; however, his extrusion flow theory, to explain how ice flowed out of central Greenland, overlooked force imbalance. Rudolf Streiff-Becker found an apparent large imbalance between ice flux discharged through a gate and net accumulation in the upstream catchment at Claridenfirn, Switzerland. Because he underestimated uncertainty in ice depth, he had to propose a strong undercurrent (extrusion flow) to evacuate the excess mass. Reassessment of his assumptions shows that extrusion was actually unnecessary. However, confluence of two lines of evidence for extrusion flow added stature to the concept. In 1952, John Nye showed that <b>free</b> <b>extrusion</b> flow was impossible due to force imbalance. Two forms of extrusion flow survive: capped extrusion flow is possible on local scales where longitudinal stress gradients allow upper ice to move slowly, and rigid-body rotational flow can allow deeper ice to move faster without strain. 1.

40|$|A {{framework}} and code {{have been developed}} to simulate fiber and film processes; the code can handle three-dimensional, isothermal, incompressible, creeping flow of a Giesekus fluid with free surfaces at infinite capillary number. The code is an extension of the parallel methods developed by Caola et al. from two- to three-dimensional flows, a restructured and improved version of the three-dimensional code of Phillips based on the subproblem formulation. The free surface motion used is an extension of the axially-constrained finite difference method of Phillips from two to three dimensions; internal domain deformation is upgraded from an elliptic mapping technique, only suitable for two-dimensional geometries, to the treatment of the domain as a fictitious elastic solid that conforms to the free surface, similar to the methods of Cairncross et al. The verification of the code and its utility are tested against the ability to capture experimental behavior in a set of benchmark problems which benefit from its ability to compute fully three-dimensional flow fields. Fluids with a nonzero second normal stress difference in simple shear flow, such as Giesekus fluids, exhibit secondary flows in non-circular, non-annular pipes. The code predicts the fully-developed three-dimensional velocity field in flow of a square duct in agreement with Yue et al. Elastically-driven flow transitions from a two-dimensional, steady flow to a three-dimensional, time periodic flow also motivate the need for three-dimensional solvers, which should be able to capture the onset directly. Flow around a closely-spaced linear periodic array of cylinders in a rectangular channel, a flow studied experimentally by Liu, exhibits this kind of flow transition. Numerical simulations have been conducted in this geometry with the Oldroyd-B model, [beta] = 0. 67, wall separation distances between 4 - 32 radii, and Deborah number 0. 1 < De < 2. 0. The range of bounding wall edge effects on the flow field is shown to be just under 4 cylinder radii. At De = 2. 0, the simulation shows small-magnitude oscillations after coming nearly to steady state, and a small-magnitude overshoot in the primary velocity component near the wall can be observed, similar to the "cat's ears" phenomenon observed by Poole et al. in planar gradual-contraction expansion flow of a viscoelastic fluid. The expected critical Weissenberg number of the flow transition has not yet been reached, but the previous limitation of Phillips at De = 0. 7 in fully 3 -D simulations of this geometry has been surpassed by over a factor of two and it is yet unknown what limiting De the code can reach with continuation methods. The free surface capability of the code is tested in <b>free</b> <b>extrusion</b> from cylindrical and elliptical dies. The code predicts the correct free surface shape and extrudate swell found in incompressible, inertialess Newtonian free jets from cylindrical capillaries. Extruded elliptical jets of Newtonian fluids (2 : 1 and 3 : 2 aspect ratios) were found to increase in area to the same extent as cylindrical jets, showing asymmetric swell to a more circular shape (1. 8 : 1 and 2. 8 : 2 final aspect ratios). When Oldroyd-B or Giesekus fluid jets are simulated, the extrudate swell computed increases greatly as Deborah number or polymer viscosity fraction increases, but the final aspect ratio appears to be insensitive to these parameters (De < 1. 0). The total amount of swell (area ratio) appears to be independent of the die shape for the elliptical shapes considered (De < 1. 0). In addition to solutions to benchmark problems, this thesis introduces the practice of Lagrangian and discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods used to solve various partial differential equations in three dimensions, including bookkeeping conventions that facilitate the development of parallel and modular solvers. Two discontinuous basis function types, discontinuous linear and mean-slope basis functions (abbreviated DLDG and MSDG), are compared in a three-dimensional linear advection problem; both methods show equivalent (quadratically convergent) accuracy in flows orthogonal to the element surfaces. While the DGMS method runs about twice as fast, the DGDL method has roughly twice the accuracy when flow is not orthogonal to element surfaces, so that the DGDL method is preferred whenever mesh refinement in more than one dimension is required to improve the accuracy. A parallel Poisson equation solver which uses PETSc is presented (the source code is available upon request) as a simple template which highlights the required structures needed in a parallel finite element code. by David Joseph Adrian.

The {{performance}} of parts produced by <b>Free</b> Form <b>Extrusion</b> (FFE) {{may be limited}} by poor mechanical properties, due to poor bonding between the individual extruded filaments.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of parts made by <b>Free</b> Form <b>Extrusion</b> (FFE) {{are controlled by}} the bonding degree between the individual extruded filaments.

40|$|The {{performance}} of parts produced by <b>Free</b> Form <b>Extrusion</b> (FFE), an increasingly popular additive manufacturing technique, depends mainly on their dimensional accuracy, surface quality and mechanical performance. These attributes are {{strongly influenced by}} {{the evolution of the}} filament temperature and deformation during deposition and solidification. Consequently, the availability of adequate process modelling software would offer a powerful tool to support efficient process set-up and optimisation. This work examines the contribution to the overall heat transfer of various thermal phenomena developing during the manufacturing sequence, including convection and radiation with the environment, conduction with support and between adjacent filaments, radiation between adjacent filaments and convection with entrapped air. The magnitude of the mechanical deformation is also studied. Once this exercise is completed, it is possible to select the material properties, process variables and thermal phenomena that should be taken in for effective numerical modelling of FFE.

40|$|During trial {{pressings}} of an {{aluminium extrusion}} {{the shape of}} the first extrudate (nose piece) tells the correctors how to change the die geometry to obtain an acceptable product. In this paper the initial filling of an aluminium extrusion die is analyzed with the objective to predict {{the shape of the}} nose piece. The calculation domain is discretized using P 1 +P 1 tetrahedral elements. The analysis is executed as an Eulerian analysis, where the material flows through the mesh. The whole domain is divided in an aluminium domain and an air domain, where the air is modeled as a pseudo material. The interface between the aluminium and the air is tracked by convection of the initial material coordinates. After the aluminium leaves the die, the free surface of the extrusion is calculated by an ALE method. The formulation of the element, the convection of the initial coordinates, the handling of the boundary conditions, the modeling of the air domain and the reconstruction of the <b>free</b> surface after <b>extrusion</b> are treated in this paper. The results of the simulations are compared to results of real extrusions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBoth {{nucleation}} and {{propagation of}} fatigue cracks in fcc metals are investigated, using 3 D discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations. Firstly, DDD simulations explain the mechanisms {{leading to the}} formation of persistent slip bands in surface grains loaded in fatigue. Extrusions are evidenced where the bands intercept the <b>free</b> surface. The <b>extrusion</b> growth rate is estimated for different material parameters and loading conditions. Energy and stress calculations performed inside the simulated grain lead to a possible scenario for the crack initiation at the interface between the band and the matrix, as reported in the literature. Secondly, a crack is inserted at the persistent slip band interface and the crack tip slip displacement evolutions are evaluated. It is shown that the crack growth rate is strongly related to the grain size and to the distance to the grain boundary; the smaller the grain, the faster the crack growth. Finally, the crack propagation to the next grain is investigated by conducting DDD fatigue simulations in a surface grain next to a cracked grain. It is shown that the development of the persistent slip band is modified by the presence of the crack. The crack orientation affects the orientation of the persistent slip band, as well as the extrusion rate, and consequently the crack propagation in the next grain...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{details the}} {{investigation}} {{relating to the}} production method and mechanical properties of two types of aluminium/silicon carbide composites. These materials are manufactured using specialised powder metallurgy (P/M) techniques, which includes mixing/milling, powder compaction, sintering and hot extrusion. The first type of composite utilises pure aluminium as the matrix, whilst the other type uses matrix consist of aluminium and in-situ oxide particles, namely sintered aluminium powder (SAP). The second type of composite combines silicon carbon particles with very small in-situ oxide particulates inside the aluminium matrix, creating a dual reinforcement system. These composites are not often characterised in literature as the fabrication process is very challenging, particularly using P/M methods. Therefore, this work offers rare insight into aluminium composites {{with a combination of}} different size reinforcement particles, which is important in establishing more novel aluminium based composites. Composites with nearly full density (> 99 % theoretical density) were successfully produced via this method. The unreinforced aluminium specimens were relatively easy to extrude and defect-free extrusions can be produced in a range of parameters. The composite material not only required a higher extrusion load, but also produced a small amount of surface defects resulting sub-optimal surface finishing. A suitable remedy is to use aluminium foil or an aluminium disc in front of the extrusion for the composite material. The foil or disc acts a solid lubricant for the hard composite material, which significantly improves the surface finishing. Using this method, crack <b>free</b> <b>extrusions</b> can be obtained at reinforcement contents up to 30 volume percent silicon carbide. Microstructural analysis using optical and electron microscopies shows the particle dispersion in the material is relative homogenous. However, particle banding and alignment are observed along the extrusion direction of the specimens. Transmission electron microscope analysis shows the particle/matrix interface is free of any major reaction, but a small layer of inter-diffusion occurred between silicon and aluminium. The sub-structure of the material adjacent to the silicon carbide particle is observed to be sub-micron. This can be related to particle –assisted nucleation during extrusion and possibly the effect of high dislocation density near the particle-matrix interface, which produces a very fine structure. Mechanical testing showed the composite reinforced with silicon carbide (1200 mesh, 13 micron) possessed a significant improvement in mechanical strength and stiffness as compared to the unreinforced material. The improvement did not diminish with increasing in reinforcement volume fraction, but follows a linear trend. This increase is related to the load transfer from the matrix to the reinforcement, the generation of thermal dislocations (which is related to the difference in co-efficient of thermal expansion between the matrix and reinforcement particles) and the small substructure near the particle-matrix interface. However, composites reinforced with the larger 65 micron SiC particle did not show any significant improvement in mechanical strength, but the ductility of the sample was reduced significantly. This is because the large reinforcement particles are easy to fracture during tensile loading because of high intrinsic flaw density. Once particles are broken, the load cannot be effectively transferred from the matrix to the reinforcement, therefore the improvement in mechanical strength is reduced. Short-term corrosion testing in 3. 5 wt. % NaCl solution (24 -hour immersion) of the composite material showed that they did not suffer accelerated corrosion as compare to the unreinforced material. The short term immersion tests were performed because they offer a quick analysis of the corrosion performance of the composite material. The corrosion rate and the polarization resistance of the composite material are similar to the unreinforced material. Although pitting corrosion near the particle-matrix interface are observed in the composite material. However, {{it is likely that the}} volume expansion of the corrosion product has filled up any voids near the interface, which can inhibit further ingress of the corrosive media into the material. The overall electrochemical behaviour of the aluminium was not significantly affected by the reinforcement addition during the short-term corrosion test. Pin on disc wear testing was also conducted on the aluminium composite, using a ruby pin and with the aluminium material as the disc material. The unreinforced aluminium showed high wear rate with continuous delamination. The wear tracks of the specimens are measured to be very deep and wide. However, the composite material with 10 vol. % SiC reinforcement showed substantial improvement in wear resistance with about 4 times lower wear rate. When the volume fraction is increased to 20 %, an order of magnitude reduction in wear rate was obtained and the wear co-efficient is about 7 times lower than as compare to the unreinforced material. However, the corrosion resistance of the composite, especially at high volume fraction is significantly reduced as compare to the unreinforced material...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{simplest}} {{mechanism of}} the generation of the mitochondrial outer membrane potential (OMP) by the VDAC (voltage-dependent anion channel) -hexokinase complex (VHC), suggested earlier, and by the VDAC-glucokinase complex (VGC), was computationally analyzed. Even at less than 4 % of VDACs bound to hexokinase, the calculated OMP is high enough to trigger the electrical closure of VDACs beyond the complexes at threshold concentrations of glucose. These results confirmed our previous hypothesis that the Warburg effect {{is caused by the}} electrical closure of VDACs, leading to global restriction of the outer membrane permeability coupled to aerobic glycolysis. The model showed that the inhibition of the conductance and/or an increase in the voltage sensitivity of a relatively small fraction of VDACs by factors like tubulin potentiate the electrical closure of the remaining <b>free</b> VDACs. The <b>extrusion</b> of calcium ions from the mitochondrial intermembrane space by the generated OMP, positive inside, might increase cancer cell resistance to death. Within the VGC model, the known effect of induction of ATP release from mitochondria by accumulated glucose- 6 -phosphate in pancreatic beta cells might result not only of the known effect of GK dissociation from the VDAC-GK complex, but also of a decrease in the free energy of glucokinase reaction, leading to the OMP decrease and VDAC opening. We suggest that the VDAC-mediated electrical control of the mitochondrial outer membrane permeability, dependent on metabolic conditions, is a fundamental physiological mechanism of global regulation of mitochondrial functions and of cell death...|$|R
40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate {{intracellular}} bacterium that is {{a public}} health burden worldwide. The precise strategies that intracellular pathogens use to exit host cells have {{a direct impact on}} their ability to disseminate within a host, transmit to new hosts, and manipulate immune responses. Chlamydia exits the host cell by two distinct strategies, lysis and extrusion. Lysis is a sequential rupture of vacuole, nuclear and plasma membranes, culminating in the release of <b>free</b> infectious bacteria. <b>Extrusion</b> is a packaged release of Chlamydia that begins with invagination of the chlamydial inclusion, followed by the pinching of the cell plasma membrane, resulting in a double membrane compartment containing Chlamydia, chlamydial inclusion, host cell cytoplasm, and host plasma membrane. Host cytokinesis proteins are required for the pinching of the chlamydial inclusion just prior to extrusion, but deeper mechanistic understanding of the host requirements that govern the final severing of the extrusion from the host cell have yet to be elucidated. Abscission, the final stage of cytokinesis that severs two daughter cells, is governed largely by the ESCRT-III family of proteins, which also participate in virus budding. Here, we define a role for host abscission proteins in the release of extrusion from the host cell. The defining characteristics of extrusions, and advantages gained by Chlamydia within this unique double-membrane structure are not well understood. Results presented here define extrusions as mostly devoid of host organelles, and containing phosphatidylserine on the outer surface of the extrusion membrane. Results further demonstrate that extrusion is highly conserved across Chlamydiae. Extrusions also served as transient, intracellular-like niches for enhanced Chlamydia survival outside the host cell. In addition to enhanced extracellular survival, extrusions are phagocytosed by primary bone marrow-derived macrophages, after which they provide a protective microenvironment for Chlamydia. Extrusion-derived Chlamydia staved off macrophage-based killing, and culminated in the release of infectious EB. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which extrusions serve as ‘trojan horses’ for Chlamydia, by exploiting macrophages as vehicles for dissemination, immune evasion, and potentially transmission...|$|R
