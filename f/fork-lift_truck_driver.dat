40|$|The {{prevalence}} of {{low back pain}} (LBP) was investigated in 598 Italian professional drivers exposed to whole-body vibration (WBV) and ergonomic risk factors (drivers of earth moving machines, <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> <b>drivers,</b> <b>truck</b> <b>drivers,</b> bus drivers). The control group consisted of {{a small sample of}} 30 fire inspectors not exposed to WBV. Personal, occupational and health histories were collected by means of a structured questionnaire. Vibration measurements were performed on representative samples of the machines and vehicles used by the driver groups. From the vibration magnitudes and exposure durations, alternative measures of vibration dose were estimated for each subject. Daily vibration exposure, expressed in terms of 8 -h energy-equivalent frequency-weighted acceleration, A(8), averaged 0. 28 – 0. 61 (range 0. 10 – 1. 18) ms 2 rms in the driver groups. Duration of exposure to WBV ranged between 1 and 41 years. The 7 -day and 12 -month {{prevalence of}} LBP was greater in the driver groups than in the controls. In the professional drivers, the occurrence of 12 -month LBP, high intensity of LBP (Von Korff pain scale score X 5), and LBP disability (Roland & Morris disability scale score X 12) significantly increased with increasing cumulative vibration exposure. Even though several alternative measures of vibration exposure were associated with LBP outcomes, nevertheless a more regular trend of association with LBP was found for vibration dose expressed as Paviti (m s 2 h), in which the frequency-weighted acceleration, av, and lifetime exposure duration, t, were given equal weight. In multivariate data analysis, individual characteristics (e. g. age, body mass index) and a physical load index (derived from combining manual materials handling and awkward postures) were significantly associated with LBP outcomes, while psychosocial work factors (e. g. job decision, job support) showed a marginal relation to LBP. This study tends to confirm that professional driving in industry is associated with an increased risk of work-related LBP. Exposure to WBV and physical loading factors at work are important components of the multifactorial origin of LBP in professional drivers...|$|R

40|$|This project {{studies the}} dynamic {{response}} of a composite floor system to excitations from moving <b>fork-lift</b> <b>trucks.</b> The floor system analysed {{is a system}} of precast and partially prestressed double-tee elements with a cast in-situ topping. Currently, there are concerns whether the vibrations caused by <b>fork-lift</b> <b>trucks</b> might exceed acceptable limits due to an ongoing trend towards structures of higher slenderness. This study investigates the mechanical background of the excitation and the current design of the floor system. The study {{is divided into three}} major chapters: Dynamic <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> model A dynamic load model of a <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> is developed which can be used in the analytical verification of the vibration serviceability of structures. The model is based on tests performed on four <b>fork-lift</b> <b>trucks</b> in various configurations. The tests are analysed for the spectrum of accelerations. The analysis results in a simple two-degree-of-freedom model. Its only variables are velocity and time. All other values are constant throughout a simulation and depend on the geometry of the specific <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> and its payload. The frequencies and phase delays are constants and they are verified as eigen-frequencies of a three-degree-of-freedom model. FE-simulation of vibrations of a composite floor system The <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> model is applied to a three-dimensional model of a composite floor system. The finiteelement model is developed to simulate the construction process of the composite floor system and its influence on the in-service properties of the structure. As part of this work a preliminary investigation of the damping potential of the joint between precast and cast in-situ concrete is undertaken. A linear time-step analysis of the structure is performed and the nodal accelerations are analysed for their magnitude, dependence on the excitation and frequency content. Field test In order to verify the FE-model of the floor system and the results of the dynamic analysis a field test was undertaken: a floor system was monitored under service conditions. The field data comprise the accelerations of the floor and the forklift truck and the position of the truck relative to the points of measurement. A comparison of the field data and the simulation results proves the validity of both the dynamic <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> model and the FE-model of the floor system.

40|$|Long-span {{warehouse}} floors {{can suffer}} problematic vibrations due to dynamic interaction with moving <b>fork-lift</b> <b>trucks.</b> However, the dynamic loads caused by trucks are poorly understood and no mathematical model of these loads {{suitable for use}} in a dynamic analysis has previously been proposed. This paper presents a two-degree-of-freedom dynamic load model of a <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> suitable {{for use in a}}n analytical floor vibration assessment. The load model comprises two time-varying vertical forces that are a fixed distance apart. Each force {{is the product of a}} mass matrix and a vertical acceleration vector, which is in turn a function of the horizontal velocity of the truck. The model derivation is partly analytical and partly experimental, with some key parameters derived from field tests on four <b>fork-lift</b> <b>trucks</b> in a total of twelve configurations. Data for general models are presented for a range of truck capacities from 1000 kg to 6000 kg.

During the tour, he was injured and lost his front teeth when the band's van, driven by Johnny Gentle, had a minor accident. However, Lennon and the Scottish organiser of the tour took him out of hospital and insisted that he perform {{with the rest of the}} group. After they returned to Liverpool, Moore had already decided that he had 'had enough of Lennon'; When he didn't appear for a gig one night, the rest of the band went round to his flat, and were told by his girlfriend that he had gone back to his steady job at the bottle works. When they tried to persuade her otherwise, she apparently said 'you can all piss off!'.

40|$|Abstract: The {{forklift}} truck {{is one of}} important equipments of the modern logistics system. As the {{forklift truck}} is running, the driver seat and steering wheel of {{a certain type of}} <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> vibrate strongly, virtual prototyping technology and multi-body dynamics are used to make simulation of dynamic performance of <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> in this paper, and then the test result is compared with time course load that obtained from frame junction with the annex. We should repeatedly modify the simulation model based on test results, which is consistent with the actual results. Based on this model, so we put forward measures for improving design: Firstly, the axis of rotation of oval steering axle is implied; Secondly, the overhead guard is connected with the frame by the rubber cushion blocks at four different locations; Thirdly, the engine is fixed on the frame by the rubber cushion blocks (shock mount) in two different position. The improved simulation and experimental verification are carried out under the same conditions, and the results show that the fundamental frequency of seat of the improved <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> and vibration energy are lower. The result proves the practical value of this method in the research of the vibration characteristics of complete engineering machine...|$|R

Methods Detailed cost and output {{data were collected from}} written records and interviews for 2005 – 2006 fiscal year using standardized methods at six sampled HIV prevention programmes for <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The total economic cost for these programmes was computed and the relation of unit cost of services per <b>truck</b> <b>driver</b> with programme scale was assessed using regression analysis. Results A total of 120, 436 <b>truck</b> <b>drivers</b> were provided services by the six programmes of which 55. 9 % were long distance <b>truck</b> <b>drivers.</b> The annual economic cost of providing services to a <b>truck</b> <b>driver</b> varied between programmes from US$ 1. 52 to 4. 56 (mean US$ 2. 49). There was an inverse relation between unit economic cost of serving a <b>truck</b> <b>driver</b> and scale of the programme (R 2 = 0. 63; p = 0. 061).
