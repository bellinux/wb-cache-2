5|$|Aoyama {{tries to}} track her down using her résumé, but as Yoshikawa warned, {{all of the}} {{contacts}} are dead ends. At the dance studio where she claimed to have trained, he finds a man with prosthetic feet. The bar where she claimed to work has been abandoned for a year following the murder and dismemberment of the owner. A passerby tells Aoyama that the police found three extra fingers, an extra ear, and an extra tongue when they recovered the body; Aoyama has hallucinations of the body pieces. Meanwhile, Asami goes to Aoyama's house and finds a photo of his late wife. Enraged, she drugs his liquor. Aoyama comes home, pours a drink, and begins feeling {{the effects of the}} drug. A flashback shows that the sack in Asami's apartment contains a man missing both feet, his tongue, one ear and three fingers on one hand. He crawls out and begs for food. Asami vomits into a dog dish and places <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> for the man. The man sticks his face into the vomit and hungrily consumes it.|$|E
25|$|The Queen's subtle use {{of signals}} to her staff in certain social {{situations}} {{has been described}} by journalist Hugo Vickers and others. It is said that by twisting her wedding ring she signals that she is ready for the conversation or event to end forthwith. Alternately, placing her handbag onto the table at dinner means that she wants the event to end within the next five minutes and by setting <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> she indicates that she is not enjoying the conversation and wants a lady-in-waiting to assist immediately.|$|E

500|$|Arcade Fire {{made their}} first {{appearance}} on Saturday Night Live on February 24, 2007 (Episode 618), performing [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "Keep the Car Running". Owen Pallett {{was not present}} as he was recording for his solo project. During the performance, one of Win Butler's guitar strings broke, prompting him to rip the strings from his acoustic guitar and smash <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> until it shattered. On this guitar, [...] "sak vide pa kanpe" [...] was written in duct tape across the front. A Haitian proverb meaning [...] "An empty sack cannot stand up" [...] in Creole, {{this may have been}} a reference to the extreme poverty of Haiti, the country of origin of Régine Chassagne.|$|E
500|$|Aldermen Edward Jones (20th) and William C. Henry (24th) {{were the}} first aldermen to arrive from the City Council session. According to the federal lawsuit, Henry showed he had a gun, and then with Jones removed the now-hung {{painting}} {{from the wall and}} placed <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> facing the wall. After they left, another student rehung the painting. Three other aldermen, Allan Streeter (17th), Dorothy Tillman (3rd) and Rush, arrived later. They took down the painting and attempted to remove it from the school, but were stopped by a school official. The aldermen then took the painting {{to the office of the}} school president Anthony Jones (no relation to Edward Jones). The painting had a [...] gash, and it had been wrapped in brown paper.|$|E
500|$|He {{was walking}} down a quiet {{suburban}} street {{on his way home}} after his usual evening teaching session. He noticed three youths hovering several yards away {{on the opposite side of}} the street. When they approached him he was ready. [...] "Give us your money, or you'll get hurt" [...] said the leader of the three. Abbe looked at each one in turn, then casually took his wallet out of his jacket pocket, throwing <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> between himself and the antagonists. He pointed to the wallet and said, [...] "I am prepared to die for that wallet, what about you?" [...] The three would-be attackers looked at the wallet on the floor, then at Abbe and then at each other and then moved away. Abbe picked up his wallet and calmly walked home.|$|E

500|$|Stevens' {{teams are}} built around solid {{basketball}} fundamentals and good team work, rather than individual basketball skill. His teams {{are known for}} their defense, forcing opponents into uncharacteristic mistakes. The secret to basketball – and life – is [...] "just to do the job {{to the best of your}} ability and don't worry about anything else," [...] Stevens says. [...] "Win the next game. Win the next possession. That's our focus. It's boring. It's also the way championships are won", he says. In short, Stevens is a strong believer in [...] "The Butler Way" [...] – doing all the little things that transform a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team. [...] "I tell the players 'the Butler Way' isn't easy to define," [...] Stevens says, [...] "but you can see <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> when we share the basketball, play with great energy and defend." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{his sophomore}} season, he was {{considered}} more raw, but more athletic than Okafor, according to the Chicago Sun-Times basketball reporter Joe Henricksen. At that stage in head-to-head competition, Alexander was overmatched by Okafor. Following his sophomore season, Reggie Rose (Derrick Rose's brother) noted that Alexander was more suited toward a fast break offense while Okafor {{would be more likely}} to excel in a half-court set. He is also compared to Anthony Bennett, although Alexander needs to improve his outside shooting to make the comparison valid and he needs to improve his low post mastery for a valid comparison to Jared Sullinger. Alexander feels he is most often compared to Amar'e Stoudemire, which he is comfortable with because he views Stoudemire as someone who [...] "...can shoot the 15-footer, put <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> post moves, sets good screens." [...] NBADraft.net compares Alexander to Thomas Robinson, while Bleacher Report's Kerry Miller compared him to Robinson and Julius Randle, noting despite his phenomenal physicality, he is undersized to play center and lacking the midrange jump shot necessary to play power forward.|$|E
500|$|Pasadena Police Department criminologist Don Harding led the {{official}} investigation; {{he concluded that}} Parsons had been mixing fulminate of mercury in a coffee can when he dropped <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> causing the initial explosion, which worsened when it {{came into contact with}} other chemicals in the room. Forman considered this likely, stating that Parsons often had sweaty hands and could easily have dropped the can. Some of Parsons' colleagues rejected this explanation, saying that he was very attentive about safety. Two colleagues from the Bermite Powder Company described Parsons' work habits as [...] "scrupulously neat" [...] and [...] "exceptionally cautious". The latter statement—from chemical engineer George Santymers—insisted that the explosion must have come from beneath the floorboards, implying an organized plot to kill Parsons. Harding accepted that these inconsistencies were [...] "incongruous" [...] but described the manner in which Parsons had stored his chemicals as [...] "criminally negligent", and noted that Parsons had previously been investigated by the police for illegally storing chemicals at the Parsonage. He also found a morphine-filled syringe at the scene, suggesting that Parsons was narcotized. The police saw insufficient evidence to continue the investigation and closed the case as an accidental death.|$|E

500|$|Sean Fitz-Gerald of Vulture {{wrote that}} [...] "the song veers toward Stefani's more mellifluous, sentimental fare," [...] {{calling it a}} [...] "heartrending track". Amanda Dykan of AltWire praised the track, stating: [...] " [...] reaches through, wraps its acrylic-nailed fingers around your {{pulsating}} heart, rips it from your chest, throws <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> and stomps all over it." [...] Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media claimed that [...] "Stefani – now 20 years wiser – flips it"; she continued with: [...] "It’s a rare moment on the album where you can pick out Stefani from a sea of other pop singers." [...] Mapes concluded by claiming that [...] "Used to Love You" [...] was her greatest song since [...] "Don't Speak", comparing its effect to Madonna's 1989 single [...] "Like a Prayer". Sean Fitz-Gerald of Vulture warned that when listening to this [...] "heartending track" [...] that [...] "tissues are a must". Consequence of Sound critic Adam Kivel enjoyed the track, calling it a [...] "recognizable moment in heartbreak delivered in a charming falsetto burble". Nate Jackson from OC Weekly appreciated the [...] "somber" [...] of the track, while Marcus Floyd from Renowned for Sound awarded it 4.5 out of 5 stars, claiming that [...] "every lyric and every note are sung with heart and chorus just gets you". Michael Smith from the same website acknowledged [...] "Used to Love You" [...] {{as one of the}} strongest songs on This Is What the Truth Feels Like, calling it [...] "unexpectedly heartfelt".|$|E
500|$|According to CNN, {{he became}} a drug dealer and used the Bible that his {{grandmother}} gave him as a good luck charm. After being arrested for drug possession, the officer saw the Bible and let Lecrae go on a promise that he would agree to live by it. He eventually turned from drugs to alcohol consumption and a party lifestyle and became a [...] "misfit of a person." [...] He has described himself during this period as a thrill-seeker, he would pull stunts such as jumping from a third-story building, and gained the nickname [...] "Crazy 'Crae". Encouraged by his concerned mother to read his Bible, Lecrae said that [...] "I remember ripping the pages out of the Bible and throwing <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> I don't want this Bible. I couldn't wrap my hands around this being true or real." [...] He began to drink and smoke more and look for more women [...] "as the emptiness became more profound." [...] At age 17, his personal, financial, and relationship troubles convinced {{him that he was}} at a [...] "dead end." [...] Wanting to do what he considered the mature thing, through the influence of his grandmother, he desired to start attending church. A girl Lecrae attended high school with was there, and she invited him to a Bible study, where he met Darragh, his future wife. Lecrae {{was surprised to find that}} the members of the Bible study [...] "were just people like me. [...] They read the same books and listened to the same music. Their character was just different. They were loving and that's really what drew me in." [...] Lecrae says that it was at age 19 that he finally decided to live for God, though [...] "it wasn't overnight" [...] and he [...] "spent a lot of time making bad decisions." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fox was {{the darling}} of his father, who found Charles [...] "infinitely {{engaging}} & clever & pretty" [...] and, {{from the time that}} his son was three years old, apparently preferred his company at meals to that of anyone else.

It was said that Charles once expressed a great desire to break his father's watch and was not restrained or punished when he duly smashed <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> On another occasion, when Henry had promised his son that he could watch the demolition of a wall on his estate and found that it had already been destroyed, he ordered the workmen to rebuild the wall and demolish it again, with Charles watching.|$|E

Besides a round unleavened loaf of bread called badnjački kolač, and salt, which are necessary, this meal may comprise roast fish, cooked beans, sauerkraut, noodles with ground walnuts, honey, and wine. It used to be served in some villages on a sack filled with straw, with the family seated around <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> In the north Dalmatian region of Bukovica, a part of food that remained after the dinner used {{to be put on}} a potsherd, and taken to the rubbish heap.

2500|$|Children's Hospital staff did {{not keep}} {{detailed}} records of Genie's early linguistic progress, and she only rarely spoke during this time, so there was little data on Genie's language for the first 6 months of her stay.

When she threw <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> Kent pretended to be concerned and said, [...] "We have to get him back", and Genie startled him when she repeated the word [...] "back" [...] and nervously laughed. When they subsequently played with the puppet she repeated [...] "back" [...] several times, and when Kent said, [...] "The puppet will fall" [...] she repeated the word [...] "fall". Apart from her tantrums, the times she played with this and similar puppets accounted {{for most of the}} few instances she made any outward expression during the early part of her stay.|$|E

[...] In another account of Helmsley's behavior, she had a {{barbecue}} pit constructed for her home. The work was performed by Eugene Brennan, a personal friend of Jeremiah McCarthy, the chief engineer of Helmsley-Spear. When the final bill came to $13,000, she refused to pay, citing shoddy workmanship. When McCarthy pleaded with her to honor the bill, citing the favor done on his behalf and informing her that Brennan had six children to support, Helmsley replied, [...] "Why didn't he keep his pants on?
