40|$|Corruption is a {{worldwide}} phenomenon that {{is described by}} scholars as cancer in society. Although, corruption is comprised of a comprehensive character {{there are several ways}} to counteract its consequences, one example would be through the enhancement of auditing. It is therefore interesting to look at what effect mandatory audits have on small and medium-sized enterprises in countries where that not exists. The research questions we have chosen to focus on are what perspective Zambian auditors have on how well suitable mandatory audits and <b>international</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>standards</b> are for Zambian SMEs? We will also explore which the auditors’ views regarding the importance of auditing and its role in combating corruption? The purpose of this thesis is to create an understanding regarding implementing and improving the usage of mandatory audits and <b>international</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>standards</b> within Zambian SMEs. This also includes enlightening the problems auditors face in their process to use these regulations within Zambian SMEs as tools to assist in the fight against the obstacles that corruption creates. This study has been done through qualitative research where the main empirical findings have been conducted through interviews with auditors in Zambia. These auditors have for instance, been asked questions about what rules that exist in their country, their view on the implementation of mandatory auditing and <b>international</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>standards</b> on SMEs, and if they have any personal experience of corruption in their line of work. The conclusion from this research showed that auditing could aid in the fight against corruption. These conclusions are based on the perceptions and opinions of the included auditors. An implementation of mandatory audits and <b>international</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>standards</b> within Zambian SMEs will detect and reduce corruption. Despite potential shortfall in knowledge while implementing adjusted ISA for SMEs, the benefits of implementation exceed the shortcomings. Auditing cannot only be used to detect corruption but also to deter it. Through mandatory audits and the risk of being caught pursuing corrupt acts will increase, deterring corruption. Consequently, auditing carries a great importance to combat corruption, and mandatory audits together with implementations of <b>international</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>standards</b> within SMEs will aid in a significant reduction of corruption in Zambia.  Korruption är ett världsutbrett fenomen som har beskrivits av forskare som cancer i samhället. Eftersom korruption har en omfattande karaktär så finns det många sätt att bekämpa den, till exempel genom att öka genomsynligheten och förbättringar av revision. Det är därför intressant att undersöka vilka effekter ett revisionskrav för SMEs skulle ha på ett land som inte har det idag. Forskningsfrågorna vi har valt att fokusera på är vilket perspektiv Zambiska revisorer har på hur väl lämpad en revisionsplikt och internationella revisionsstandarder är för Zambiska SMEs?

Syftet med denna uppsats är att skapa en förståelse angående implementering och förbättring av revisionskrav och internationella revisionsstandarder i Zambiska SMEs. I det här inkluderas också att upplysa om problematiken för revisorerna i deras process att använda dessa reglementen i Zambiska små och medelstora företag som ett verktyg för att hjälpa till i kampen mot de hinder som korruption skapar.

Slutsatsen från den här undersökningen är att revision kan hjälpa till att bekämpa korruption. En implementering av ett revisionskrav och internationella revisionsstandarder i Zambiska SMEs kommer att ertappa och reducera korruption.

We wonder what is actually sampling and how did it appear? Audit sampling involves the application of audit procedures to less than 100 % of items within an account balance or class of transactions. Nowadays the technique is indispensable, the economic entities operating with sophisticated computer systems and large amounts of data. Economic globalization and complexity of capital markets has made possible not only the harmonization of international accounting standards with the national ones, but also the convergence of international accounting and auditing standards with the American regulations.
