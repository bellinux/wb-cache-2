40|$|Integral <b>foam</b> <b>moulding</b> (IFM) is an {{economical}} way {{to produce}} castings with integrated cellular structure, i. e. a solid {{skin and a}} foamed core. IFM {{has been known for}} polymers for more than four decades and is well established in industrial production. Polymer integral foam parts are accepted as a material system with own properties which simplifies designs, reduces production costs and weight, and increases stiffness and overall strength. On the other hand, integral <b>foam</b> <b>moulding</b> for metals is a new field of research. The development of metal based integral <b>foam</b> <b>moulding</b> processes at WTM moves along analogous paths as that of polymers by transferring and adapting successful moulding technologies for polymer integral foam to metals. Two moulding techniques for metal integral foam are presented, a low and a high pressure process. In the low pressure process, the molten metal charged with blowing agent is injected into a permanent steel mould without completely filling it. In this case, the mould gets eventually filled by foam expansion. In the high pressure process foaming is initiated by expansion of the mould cavity after it has been filled completely with the mixture of the metal melt and the blowing agent. The moulded parts are characterized with respect to their cellular structure, density profile and pore size distribution. Mechanical properties such as stiffness and damping behaviour are discussed.

40|$|This is {{a journal}} article. It was {{published}} in the journal, Plastics, rubber and composites : macromolecular engineering [© Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining] and is also available at: [URL] polyurethane (PU) <b>foam</b> <b>moulding</b> process involves the use of sacrificial release agents (SRAs) that are both costly and harmful to the environment. This research proposes the use of low surface energy, polymer substrates, as a means of eliminating SRAs from the <b>foam</b> <b>moulding</b> process. Previous work identified the major factors affecting the ability of a polymer surface to release a PU foam part as being the surface energy and surface roughness of the substrate, and the proportion of isocyanate in the foam. The research described here has built upon these results and quantified the effects of each factor by using a D optimal design of experiment structure. Crucially it has also been shown that, given the surface energy of a polymer substrate, its roughness and the composition of the foam, it is possible to predict whether or not unaided release should be possible, and a model has been produced in order to allow this prediction for the foams under consideration. This capability will provide the PU <b>foam</b> <b>moulding</b> industry with the possibility of identifying polymeric mould materials, and levels of finishing for these moulds, which have the potential to allow the elimination of SRAs from the production process...|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of large plastic parts, in small series and at low cost, requires {{the development of}} alternative tools and materials. Structural foams (SF) are a good solution, when the {{production of}} thicker parts with good properties is the specification. They allow obtaining lightweight parts with high stiffness and good dimensional stability, due to their sandwich-like structure constituted by a cellular core and two solid skins. The porous core results from {{the addition of a}} blowing agent in the polymeric matrix. These materials are applied in urban furniture, automotive, nautical and aerospace industries. The most used process to produce SF is the low pressure <b>foam</b> <b>moulding,</b> which is a short shot process, with impression pressures below 4 MPa. Thus, the use of hybrid moulds with moulding blocks obtained by rapid prototyping routes is seen as a viable alternative for SF injection moulding. This work reports on a study of the influence of processing conditions on the aesthetical, morphological, and mechanical properties of SF mouldings of high-impact polystyrene (HIPS-SF). The results compare the effect of the use of hybrid moulds to conventional moulds on the surface aspect of the circular centre gated mouldings. Furthermore the influence of the moulding temperature is ascertained in terms of the resulting cellular morphology, the flexural stiffness of the plate mouldings, and the impact resistance in the instrumented drop weight test...|$|E
40|$|Seamless bra cup {{moulding}} is {{an important}} manufacturing technique for the apparel industry,and in particular,for bra production. Polyurethane(PU) foams and/or fabric-foam laminated sheets are moulded into a desirable cup shape in order to fit the three-dimensional(3 D) breast contour. Such foam cups not only provide {{a wide range of}} designs combined with different levels of softness and support,but also reduce production costs with minimum cutting and sewing of seams. In this study,two selected PU foam and fabric materials typically used for bra cup moulding were examined. Their respective performance behaviour in relation to different moulding temperatures and time changes were recorded and analyzed. The results reveal that cup heights are greatly affected by the use of foam and/or fabric-foam laminated materials. High moulding temperatures and/or prolonged dwell time could be required when deforming laminated materials and setting large cup sizes. Nevertheless,cup height cannot be taken as the only criteria to determine the optimal moulding conditions,and this is especially the case for large cup sizes. The design of mould heads is a major factor that affects the dimension changes of foam cups. In this respect,to control the <b>foam</b> <b>moulding</b> process,it is suggested that bra manufacturers examine the fabric/foam material properties to determine the optimal moulding condition,and quantify the shape of foam cups to enhance the design and development process of aluminum mould heads.

40|$|Alulight {{aluminum}} foam parts {{prepared by}} PM-techniques are very promising for lightweight structures {{because of their}} excellent stiffness-to-weight ratio. However they structural use is considerably limited by a fact, {{that they are not}} able to withstand higher tensile stresses, which provide good conditions for rapid widening of surface cracks in highly porous structure. This essential drawback can be overcome via strengthening of tensile loaded surface of the foamed part with various wires or fibers woven into webs, similarly as it is in a case or reinforced concrete. According to a novel foaming technique, the reinforcements are placed in the <b>foaming</b> <b>mould</b> together with foamable precursor and in a course of foam expansion they are infiltrated with molten cell-wall material.

40|$|Aluminium Lost Foam {{castings}} {{were made}} using gravity and counter-gravity filling techniques. Tensile strength {{was found to}} be most uniform in those castings which had been filled slowly from the bottom and where the metal front had remained stable throughout filling sequence. Pores containing carbon deposits were found on the fracture surfaces of all the castings made and this suggested that the defect was caused by polymer entrapment. A Saffman-Taylor instability was observed at the interface between Hg and a viscous glucose syrup which were contained in an analogue, that was used simulate the casting of Lost <b>Foam</b> <b>moulds</b> at room temperature. The liquid degradation products of the polystyrene patterns were also found to be viscous, although this was reduced by treatment with Br. Under the same conditions of temperature and velocity, the interface observed during the filling of a Br-treated pattern was planar whereas that of an untreated pattern was unstable. This demonstrated not only that the interfacial instability entrapped polymer degradation products, which adversely affected casting quality, but was probably of the Saffman-Taylor type.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this study focused on the effect of cone {{calorimeter}} test variables on polyurethane flexible foam properties such as ignitability, heat release rate, effective heat of combustion and mass loss. Three of the main commercial foam types were used; viz. conventional slabstock foams, high resilience slabstock <b>foams</b> and all-MDI <b>moulded</b> <b>foams.</b> A decrease in heat flux (down to 40 %) with increasing distance from the conical heater was measured. As a consequence, results were found to depend to a large extent on the thickness and the melting behaviour of the foam samples. To achieve a sufficiently constant and uniform heat flux exposure, sample thickness had to be limited to 2. 5 cm. In addition, repeatability was found to be good under various conditions, with percentage standard deviations for effective heat of combustion, peak rate of heat release and mass loss below 10 %. Levels of radiant flux above 25 kW/m 2 were found to be very severe to test flexible polyurethane foams. Under such conditions, foams that show big differences in combustion performance in small scale flammability tests, performed almost identically in the cone calorimeter. In the second part of this study, the effects of foam variables, such as foam type, density and melamine content, were defined. These effects were clearly pronounced at radiant flux levels of 15 to 25 kW/m 2. Density was found to be the key variable in controlling ignition resistance. In addition, high-resilience slabstock <b>foams</b> and all-MDI <b>moulded</b> <b>foams</b> performed better than conventional slabstock foams of the same density. Melamine addition resulted in a delay of ignition for all three foam types and an incomplete combustion, decreased heat release and effective heat of combustion, in case of HR slabstock and all-MDI <b>moulded</b> <b>foams.</b> However, melamine is not effective as a heat sink in conventional slabstock foams.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the lightweight}} potential of long fibre-reinforced and local continuous fibre-reinforced <b>foam</b> injection <b>moulded</b> components. Using the LFT-D foam process and breathing mould technology, long glass fibre-reinforced polypropylene foams were manufactured with a constant weight {{per unit area}} and varying density reductions. As the area moment of inertia increases with the wall thickness to the third power, in these investigations small density reductions were sufficient to increase the flexural rigidity by several hundred percent compared to a compact reference sample. The fibre length advantage generated by the direct process (injection moulding compounding) also meant that even at higher density reductions the ductility was not reduced by the foaming. In order to achieve even better mechanical properties, <b>foam</b> injection <b>moulding</b> can be combined with local continuous fibre reinforcement. To demonstrate the existing potential, sandwich integral foam components with local continuous fibre-reinforced facing were in-situ produced in an injection mould and characterised. Fully consolidated tape blanks and self-reinforced PP fabrics were positioned {{on both sides of the}} cavity and heated. Afterwards a gas-loaded melt was injected between them. A short embossing stroke generated sufficient interfacial adhesion between the facing layers and the core material, and the foaming process was initiated by the pressure drop resulting from the precision opening of the injection compression mould...|$|R

40|$|Foams are {{cellular}} structures, {{produced by}} gas bubbles formed during the polyurethane polymerization mixture. Flexible PU foams meet {{the following two}} criteria: have a limited resistance to an applied load, being both permeable to air and reversibly deformable. There are two main types of flexible foams, hot and cold cure foams differing in composition and processing temperatures. The hot cure foams are widely applied and represent the main composition of actual foams, while cold cure foams present several processing and property advantages, e. g, faster demoulding time, better humid aging properties and more versatility, as hardness variation with index changes are greater than with hot cure foams. The processing of cold cure foams also is attractive due to the low energy consumption (mould temperature from 30 degrees to 65 degrees C) comparatively to hot cure <b>foams</b> (<b>mould</b> temperature from 30 degrees to 250 degrees C). Another advantage is the high variety of soft materials for low temperature processing <b>moulds.</b> Cold cure <b>foams</b> are diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) based while hot cure foams are toluene diisocyanate (TDI) based.

40|$|The use of {{recycled}} machining chips instead of aluminium powder to produce foamable precursor material {{leads to a}} significant decrease of the material and manufacturing costs. For the processing of aluminium cutting chips the thixocasting technique is appropriate because this technique offers the possibility to directly use chip-slugs briquetted analogueously to the normal procedure for chip recycling. The strong shearing of chip-material and the high temperatures during the thixocasting process lead to precursor components with a homogenous structure. For the present investigation the alloy AlMg 4. 5 Mn 0. 7 was selected because large quantities of chips from this alloy are available resulting from e. g. sawing processes. The challenge was to improve the known unfavourable foaming characteristics of this alloy {{by the addition of}} small quantities of stabilizing particles, elements and their combinations. For the investigations the following additives were used: CaO, TiB 2, Si 3 N 4, Al 2 O 3; Sn, Sb, as well as the combinations of CaO with Al 2 O 3 and CaO with Sn. The foaming agent quantity was l wt. % TiH 2 for all variants. The briquettes were heated in a conventional air-circulation furnace into the semi-solid state. After heating the slugs were transferred to the thixocasting machine and pressed into a plate cavity. For the qualitative evaluation of the foaming behaviour and the pore structure specimens of each mixture were foamed without and also within a <b>foaming</b> <b>mould.</b> The quantitative expansion and collapse behaviour of the samples were characterized with a mechanical expandometer. The different test methods showed the best foam stabilization characteristics for CaO, Si 3 N 4 and Al 2 O 3.

Plaster moulded prototype castings possess dimensional tolerances and surface quality comparable to die castings, but vithout the high tooling costs and lead times. &fortunately, the mechanical properties of plaster castings are significantly inferior to their die cast counterparts. This is due pri-marily to the low thermal conductivity of plaster which extends casting solidijication time signijicantly compared to die or even sand casting processes.

The analyses revealed that moulding temperature greatly affected the shape conformity of moulded bra cup, and the interactions between moulding temperature and dwell time have major influence on the control of bra cup moulding process. The optimal cup shape conformity and the corresponding settings of the selected variables in bra cup moulding process were obtained by solving the quadratic regression model, as well as by analyzing the response surface contour plots.

The thesis examines the application viability of the Methyl formate blown rigid foams. In this regard the real trial applications, e. g. pipe filling, rigid <b>foam</b> spray and <b>moulding</b> have been conducted, which are commonly adopted in making most of the end products. In this thesis the physical properties that are most crucial from application point of view have been focused like dimensional stability, Compressive Strength, close cell contents, thermal conductivity and buoyancy. Comparison of few of these properties is also done, where needed, between the rigid foams blown with Methyl formate Vs 141 b - otherwise only Methyl formate blown foam is focused. The effects of different parameters on thermal conductivity of the foam have also been examined {{which is the most}} important characteristic of the foam used for insulation purpose. All these application trials have been found quite satisfactory and also achieved satisfactory results in respect to all those required characteristics of the foam e. g. flowability in pipe filling trial, thermal conductivity in insulation spray trial, dimensional stability and close cell contents, compressive strength in Buoyancy loss test. It is obvious and proved that the lower thermal conductivity value of 141 b compared to that of Methyl formate and Carbon dioxide gives lower thermal conductivity values both in spray foams and the hand pour. But the Methyl formate blown foams also show quite reasonable values to make it a choice as insulation foam. The Methyl formate blown spray insulation foams are successfully being produced and sold in the market by FSI USA and Australian Urethane Systems in Australia. Their trade name for Methyl formate is ECOMATE.

5000|$|Cooperalls were {{designed}} by Brian Heaton, the senior designer for Cooper Canada from 1972 to 1975. Promoted as [...] "a complete hockey uniform system" [...] it consisted of an elasticated girdle extending {{from the middle of}} the rib cage to the top of the knees, worn beneath a tracksuit-style woven nylon outer shell covering waist to ankle. The girdle had pockets in to which lightweight, compression <b>moulded</b> <b>foam</b> pads were placed and the close fitting nature of the garment ensured that the pads always stayed in contact with the areas of the body they {{were designed}} to protect. This replaced the traditional combination of short hockey pants and socks, and Cooper claimed that when combined with their own brand of extra light shin guards, shoulder pads and gloves the system weighed 40% less than a conventional uniform. As well as being considerably lighter, the system offered players greater freedom of movement and improved hip, pelvis and thigh protection.|$|R
