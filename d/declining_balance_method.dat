50|$|For {{financial}} reporting purposes, {{the two most}} popular methods of accelerated depreciation are the double <b>declining</b> <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> and the sum-of-the-years’ digits method.

In the United States, the two currently allowable depreciation methods for tax purposes are both accelerated depreciation methods (ACRS and MACRS).|$|E
50|$|Depreciation is {{a method}} of reallocating {{the cost of a}} {{tangible}} asset over its useful life span of it being in motion. Businesses depreciate long-term assets for both tax and accounting purposes.The former affects the balance sheet of a business or entity, and the latter affects the net income that they report. Generally the cost is allocated, as depreciation expense, among the periods in which the asset is expected to be used. This expense is recognized by businesses for financial reporting and tax purposes. Methods of computing depreciation, and the periods over which assets are depreciated, may vary between asset types within the same business and may vary for tax purposes. These may be specified by law or accounting standards, which may vary by country. There are several standard methods of computing depreciation expense, including fixed percentage, straight line, and <b>declining</b> <b>balance</b> <b>methods.</b> Depreciation expense generally begins when the asset is placed in service. For example, a depreciation expense of 100 per year for five years may be recognized for an asset costing 500.|$|R

50|$|In 1981, Congress again {{changed the}} {{depreciation}} system, providing generally for shorter lives for recovery of costs. Under the Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS), broad groups of assets were assigned {{based on the}} old ADR lives (which the IRS has updated since).

50|$|This {{refers to}} the {{reduction}} in value of equipments as it becomes older and more obsolete. For example, if a printer has a potential useful life span of 5 years, the amount {{that it can be}} sold for will decrease each year. Therefore, this value in depreciation is calculated as a manufacturing overhead. Moreover, this also applies to vehicles as they tend to depreciate in value significantly after the first year. When calculating manufacturing overheads, accountants mainly use two methods: straight-line method and <b>declining</b> <b>balance</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E
50|$|Only the <b>declining</b> <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> and {{straight}} line method of computing depreciation are allowed under MACRS. Taxpayers using the declining balance {{change to the}} straight line method at {{the point at which}} depreciation deductions are optimized. See the tables below. All tangible personal property acquired during the year is considered placed in service {{in the middle of the}} tax year (“half-year convention”). Real property is considered placed in service in the middle of the month in which acquired (“mid-month convention"). Special rules apply for pro rating deductions for short tax years and for the first year of business, or where more than 40% of tangible personal property additions are in the final quarter of the year.|$|E

Under the United States depreciation system, the Internal Revenue Service publishes a detailed guide which includes a table of asset lives and the applicable conventions. The table also incorporates specified lives for certain commonly used assets (e.g., office furniture, computers, automobiles) which override the business use lives. U.S. tax depreciation is computed under the double <b>declining</b> <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> switching to straight line or the straight line method, at the option of the taxpayer.

40|$|A {{replacement}} {{model is}} presented for a productive asset subject to stochastic input decay, tax allowances {{due to a}} deterministic depreciation variable, and a fixed investment cost. The risk neutral valuation function is formulated and optimal trigger levels signalling replacement for the two factors is determined analytically although not as a closed-form solution. We demonstrate that the operating cost trigger level depends on asset age and increases monotonically due to positive volatility changes and that the model solution furnishes the results for certain special cases. The analysis is conducted both for a depreciation schedule specified by the declining balance and straight line method. The comparative analysis shows that although no universal ideal depreciation schedule exists between the two, the <b>declining</b> <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> is preferred. Finally, the solution method is sufficiently tractable to be applied in principle to real option models where time is a critical factor. 1...|$|E

Loans quoted with flat interest rates generally prevail where <b>declining</b> <b>balance</b> calculations are not understandable to most borrowers, which - as mentioned above - is the case almost everywhere.

This was accompanied additionally by attractive tax incentives, designed as an accelerated <b>declining</b> <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> of depreciation for housing investments during the late 1990 s. The accumulated needs for comfortable housing after 40 years of a disastrous housing policy of the GDR era were generally accepted as justification for the subvention policy. But various subsidies and tax incentives caused a construction boom, false allocations, and a price bubble in Eastern Germany. After recognizing that the expansion of housing supply was not {{in line with the}} demographic development and that high vacancy rates were jeopardizing housing companies and their financial backers, policy changed in 2001. Up to now, the government provides demolition grants to reduce the vast oversupply.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a critical discussion comparing the traditional method and a newly proposed <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> to calculate percent recovery of fertilizer P applied to soils. The traditional difference method {{is defined as}} P uptake from the soil treated with fertilizer P minus P uptake from a control with no P added divided {{by the amount of}} fertilizer P applied. The <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> simply considers the ratio of P uptake from the P fertilized soil to the amount of fertilizer P applied and does not use a control to discount P taken up from soil without fertilizer application. The percentage recovery of fertilizer P calculated by the difference method normally ranges from 10 to 25 % for a given crop in a given season and is always lower than that by the <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> which ranges from 50 to 90 % and is sometimes over 100 %. The <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> is inappropriate to calculate percentage recovery of current fertilizer P applied due to its overestimation and the invalidity of the mathematical equation used.
