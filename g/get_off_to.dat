25|$|Barry Melrose would record {{his first}} win {{as a head}} coach in over 13 years on October 21, 2008, with a 3–2 victory over the Atlanta Thrashers. However, the Lightning did not <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a great start as hoped, and Melrose was {{eventually}} fired by the Lightning with a 5–7–4 record.

25|$|The Wild would <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> {{a strong}} {{start in the}} 2001–02 season by getting at least one point in their first seven games. However, the Wild would finish in last place again {{with a record of}} 26–35–12–6. Along the way, there were signs the Wild were improving, as second-year speedster Gaborik had a solid sophomore season with 30 goals, {{including}} an invite to the NHL YoungStars Game, and Andrew Brunette led the team in scoring with 69 points.|$|E

Under Seymour the Nats would rebound and finish the 1956–57 season in second place {{with a record of}} 38–34. In the playoffs the Nats would have trouble knocking off the defending champion Philadelphia Warriors advancing to the Eastern Finals with 2 straight wins. However, the Nats would be swept in 3 straight games by the eventual champions, the Boston Celtics.|$|E

25|$|The project {{planning}} did not <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a good start, however, with contention between the 49ers {{and the city}} of San Francisco over viable locations for the new stadium. Initially, the idea was to build a stadium {{in the parking lot of}} Candlestick Park and later demolish the aging stadium. Team ownership feared that construction of the village and the stadium would severely limit the amount of land available in Candlestick Point, creating a parking problem for fans and increasing traffic along the roads that link the stadium to the freeway. Moreover, with residents in the low-income housing by 2016, traffic would be permanently increased, further damaging the already-limited methods of transportation to the park.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{off their}} disappointing playoff loss, the Stars would <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a shaky {{start to the}} 2003–04 season, as they played mediocre hockey through {{the first three months}} of the season, posting a sub-.500 record. As the {{calendar}} turned to 2004, however, the Stars began to find their game, as they posted a 9–4–3 record in January. As the season wore on, the Stars would get stronger, climbing up the playoff ladder and eventually reaching second place in the Pacific Division, where they finished with a solid 41–26–13–2 record; Marty Turco had another outstanding season, recording a 1.98 GAA. However, the Stars could not carry their momentum into the playoffs, as they were beaten by the Colorado Avalanche in five games in the first round.|$|E

25|$|The Spurs christened the SBC Center {{in style}} on November 1, 2002 by {{defeating}} the Toronto Raptors 91–72. The Spurs would not <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a flying start {{as they had}} just a 19–13 record heading into January. In January the Spurs began to gel and seemed prepped to make a run, when they embarked on their annual Rodeo Road Trip, a nine-game road trip from January 25 to February 16. However, it would be hardly a {{bump in the road}} for the charging Spurs, who won eight of the nine and began to climb their way to first place. The Spurs went on to erase their seven-game deficit and finished the season in a tie with the Dallas Mavericks for {{the best record in the}} NBA (60–22). Thanks to a tiebreaker, the Spurs won their third straight Division title as Tim Duncan claimed his second straight NBA MVP.|$|E
25|$|This {{earned him}} a lucrative move to Premier League side Coventry City for a fee of £500,000. However his chances at Highfield Road were limited and after making only 7 {{appearances}} plus a loan spell at Fulham he moved to Stoke City in February 1998. He didn't <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the best of starts with Stoke as he struggled with illness and form as Stoke suffered relegation from the First Division in 1997–98. He improved in 1998–99, netting eight goals. In 1999–2000 Lightbourne scored 10 goals in 52 appearances as Stoke reached the play-offs where they lost to Gillingham. He played in the 2000 Football League Trophy Final at Wembley as Stoke beat Bristol City 2–1. In 2000–01 he found his chances of first team football more restricted but still managed five goals in 28 appearances. In {{the latter part of}} the season he spent spells on loan at Swindon Town and Cardiff City.|$|E
25|$|The 2011–12 season saw Everton <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> their now {{customary}} sluggish start, {{and were}} struggling in 16th {{place at the}} beginning of November. The turn of the year, and the signing of Nikica Jelavić from Rangers, saw fortunes improve dramatically, however. The club embarked on a sequence of only two defeats in 17 League and Cup matches, including wins over Manchester City, Chelsea and Tottenham. Everton also found themselves in an all-Merseyside FA Cup Semi-final for the right to play Tottenham or Chelsea in the final at Wembley. After taking the lead through a Jelavić goal, Everton were pegged {{back in the second half}} and conceded a late winner to end their Cup run for the season. This reverse not withstanding, it was Jelavić's goals (nine in 13 appearances since his transfer) that helped secure only four defeats in the last 24 league games, and a seventh-place finish, ahead of Liverpool for the first time in eight seasons.|$|E

25|$|After their disappointing {{second round}} collapse, the Spurs looked {{to regain the}} NBA crown. With the {{acquisition}} of guard Brent Barry from Seattle, the Spurs would <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a quick start, posting a 12–3 record in November. The Spurs would stay hot through December as they established a 25–6 record entering the New Year. With the later additions of center Nazr Mohammed from New York (acquired in a midseason trade of Malik Rose), and veteran forward Glenn Robinson from free agency, alongside regulars Bruce Bowen, Robert Horry, Tony Parker, Manu Ginóbili, and Tim Duncan, the Spurs would be near the top in the Western Conference all season, battling the Phoenix Suns for {{the best record in}} the NBA. Just as it appeared the Spurs would cruise toward the playoffs their season suddenly hit a bump in the road when Tim Duncan suffered an ankle injury. The Spurs struggled the rest of the season, finishing just 59–23. However, by the time the playoffs rolled around, Duncan was ready to return.|$|E
25|$|The Blue Jackets would <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a solid {{start in}} 2003–04, winning {{three of their}} first four games, though the club would {{eventually}} go on a seven-game losing streak to quickly fall out of playoff contention. Columbus would continue to struggle, and General Manager and Head Coach Doug MacLean announced on January 1, 2004, that he would step down from head coaching duties, naming Blue Jackets assistant coach and former NHL player Gerard Gallant as his replacement. Columbus posted a 9–21–4–3 record under MacLean. While the Blue Jackets would play better hockey with Gallant behind the bench, the team would fail once again to earn a playoff spot, as they finished {{the season with a}} 25–45–8–4 record for 62 points—seven fewer than the previous season—and finish 29 points the Nashville Predators for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. Columbus, however, climbed out of the basement in the Central Division {{for the first time in}} franchise history after finishing ahead of the Chicago Blackhawks.|$|E

The Rays {{had a chance to}} get on the scoreboard in the 3rd inning with the bases loaded and one out, but would not score as B.J. Upton hit into a double play. The Phillies would add another run in the 4th inning on an RBI groundout, jumping out to a 3–0 lead. Carl Crawford the longest tenured Ray on the team's roster, would give the Rays their first run in World Series history, by hitting a solo home run off of Phillies' starter Cole Hamels in the 4th inning, cutting the deficit of 3–1. In the 5th inning, Akinori Iwamura hit an RBI double to bring the Rays within one. The Rays would not be able to put up any more offense, with the Phillies relief pitchers retiring the Rays' last six batters and winning the game 3–2, taking the first game of the series.|$|E
