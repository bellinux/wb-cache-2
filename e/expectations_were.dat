The actor {{was tired}} of doing {{independent}} films where his <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> not met; when he met with director Bryan Singer, he went into a 15-minute tirade telling him {{what it was like}} to work with him. After Baldwin was finished, Singer told him exactly what he expected and wanted, which impressed the actor.|$|E

Webber's move to Williams brought about comparisons to Alan Jones, Australia's last F1 World Champion, also in a Williams. <b>Expectations</b> <b>were</b> high as Webber's former team boss Paul Stoddart predicted Webber would take his first victory in 2005 while Williams technical director Sam Michael said Webber would eventually win the World Championship with Williams.|$|E

5|$|Kahaanis first-look poster was {{launched}} on 2 December 2011, {{and the official}} trailer on 5 January 2012. The poster, portraying a pregnant Vidya Balan and lacking any romantic element, was well received. Critics' <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> low, owing to the director's previous box-office failures. Vidya appeared in public with a prosthetic belly to promote the film, and mingled with the public in railway stations, bus stands and markets. She often carried a sketch of her on-screen missing husband, and asked people to help in finding him. Social-networking website Ibibo.com developed an online game, The Great Indian Parking Wars, which required players to park Vidya's taxi on a street; it was well-received, reaching 50,000 hits in 10 days.|$|E
5|$|Parseghian also {{recognized}} talent in quarterback John Huarte {{and wide receiver}} Jack Snow, who had been used only sparingly for two seasons by previous coaches. Huarte could throw far and accurately but was soft-spoken, a trait Parseghian and his staff helped change. Snow was large for a receiver of his era, but Parseghian thought his athleticism and sure hands would make him a good wideout. Still, <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> muted for the 1964 season: Parseghian told his coaches that the team would have a 6–4 record if they were lucky. Sports Illustrated predicted a 5–5 record at best, and the team did not rank among the top 20 programs {{in the country in}} the pre-season AP Poll.|$|E
5|$|The California Golden Bears {{earned a}} 7–5 record in 2002, {{a year that}} culminated with a 30–7 victory over {{traditional}} rival Stanford in the Big Game.

New head coach Jeff Tedford was praised for turning the program around so quickly, and <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> high heading into the 2003 season. Tedford was awarded a new five-year contract in the offseason, and in the annual preseason poll of media covering the Pac-10 conference, Cal was picked to finish eighth in the 10-team organization.|$|E

5|$|Andrée {{resisted}} Ekholm's criticisms to {{the point}} of deception. On the boat back from Svalbard, Ekholm learned from the chief engineer of the hydrogen plant the explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements: Andrée had from time to time secretly ordered extra topping-up of the hydrogen in the balloon. Andrée's motives for such self-destructive behavior are not known. Several modern writers, following Sundman's Andrée portrait in the semi-documentary novel, The Flight of the Eagle (1967), have speculated that Andrée had by this time become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign. The sponsors and the media followed every delay and reported on every setback, and were clamoring for results. Andrée, Strindberg, and Ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in Stockholm and Gothenburg (see image from Aftonbladet, right), and now all the <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> coming to nothing with the long wait for southerly winds at Danes Island. Especially pointed was the contrast between Nansen's simultaneous return, covered in polar glory from his daring yet well-planned expedition on the ship Fram, and Andrée's failure even to launch his own much-hyped conveyance. Sundman theorizes that Andrée could not face letting the press report {{that he did not know}} the prevailing wind direction, and had also miscalculated in ordering the balloon, and needed a new one to rectify his error.|$|E
5|$|As it {{was their}} first studio album in almost {{eighteen}} months (and coming after the success of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band) <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> high {{at the time of}} the release of The Beatles. The album debuted at number 1 in the UK on 7 December 1968. It spent seven weeks at the top of the UK charts (including the entire competitive Christmas season), until it was replaced by the Seekers' Best of the Seekers on 25 January 1969, dropping to number 2. However, the album returned to the top spot the next week, spending an eighth and final week at number 1. The album was still high in the charts when the Beatles' follow-up album, Yellow Submarine, was released, which reached number 3. In all, The Beatles spent 22 weeks on the UK charts, far fewer than the 149 weeks for Sgt. Pepper. In September 2013 after the British Phonographic Industry changed their sales award rules, the album was declared as having gone platinum, meaning sales of at least 300,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Expectations</b> <b>were</b> {{high for}} the 2008 season, but Cleveland {{finished}} last in the AFC North with a 4–12 record. Anderson shared starts with Ken Dorsey, who the Browns had acquired by trading away Trent Dilfer, and Brady Quinn, a young quarterback the team drafted in 2007. The Browns never contended during 2008 and failed to score a touchdown in the final six games. Near {{the end of the}} season, two scandals shook the team. It was revealed that several Browns players, including Winslow, were suffering from staph infections, which raised questions about sanitation in the Browns' Berea practice facilities. In November, Savage found himself {{in the center of a}} media storm after an angry e-mail exchange with a fan was published on Deadspin, a sports blog. Shortly after the final game, a 31–0 loss to the Steelers, Lerner fired Savage and, a day later, Crennel.|$|E

5|$|<b>Expectations</b> <b>were</b> {{high with}} head coach António José Conceição Oliveira (Toni), {{who had been}} part of Benfica's wins in 1988–89 and 1993–94, {{starting}} his third complete season with the team. In the transfer market, the club shipped out regular starters from the past seasons and brought in new players, mixing the experience of Zlatko Zahovič and Ljubinko Drulović with acquisitions Pedro Mantorras and Simão Sabrosa. By December the team was still in the title race after seven wins and seven draws. However, that month the team suffered its first defeat, a close draw against Sporting, and their exit from the Taça de Portugal. These setbacks caused Toni to resign and be replaced by his assistant, Jesualdo Ferreira. After the change, Ferreira guided the team to third-place by late March, where several injuries in key players impacted their momentum. They finished the season with 17 wins, twelve draws and five losses, putting them in fourth place and keeping them out of the European league for another year.|$|E
5|$|Keynesians and monetarists {{recognized}} that people based their economic decisions on {{expectations about the}} future. However, until the 1970s, most models relied on adaptive expectations, which assumed that <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> based on an average of past trends. For example, if inflation averaged 4% over a period, economic agents were assumed to expect 4% inflation the following year. In 1972 Lucas, influenced by a 1961 agricultural economics paper by John Muth, introduced rational expectations to macroeconomics. Essentially, adaptive expectations modeled behavior {{as if it were}} backward-looking while rational expectations modeled economic agents (consumers, producers and investors) who were forward-looking. New classical economists also claimed that an economic model would be internally inconsistent if it assumed that the agents it models behave as if they were unaware of the model. Under the assumption of rational expectations, models assume agents make predictions based on the optimal forecasts of the model itself. This did not imply that people have perfect foresight, but that they act with an informed understanding of economic theory and policy.|$|E

Lawson {{was supposed to take}} some of the ball-handling pressures off of Harden, and they were bringing back nearly the same team that made it to the Western Conference Finals the previous year. However, things did not go according to plan. Kevin McHale was fired at the beginning of the season after the Rockets only won 4 of their first 11 games. J. B. Bickerstaff, his assistant, took over the head coaching duties. The Rockets struggled to remain in the playoff contention throughout the season due to inconsistent play and injuries. Lawson was waived mid-season in a buyout agreement. Houston only clinched the eight seed in the 2016 playoffs by beating the Kings in the last game of the regular season. In the first round of the playoffs, the Rockets played the Warriors, who were coming off a record-breaking regular season. The Rockets once again lost to the Warriors in 5 games.|$|E

5|$|Victory brought {{mixed results}} for Brazil and Argentina. As the Brazilian {{government}} had expected, the conflict was a short-lived and relatively easy affair {{that led to}} the installation of a friendly government in Uruguay. The official estimates included 549 battlefield casualties (109 dead, 439 wounded and 1 missing) from the navy and army and an unknown number who died from disease. Historian José Bernardino Bormann put the total at 616 (204 dead, 411 wounded and 1 missing). The war would have been deemed an outstanding success for Brazil, {{had it not been for}} its terrible consequences. Instead of demonstrating strength, Brazil revealed military weakness that an emboldened Paraguay sought to exploit. From the Argentine viewpoint, most of Bartolomé Mitre's <b>expectations</b> <b>were</b> frustrated by the war's outcome. He had succeeded in bringing to power his friend and ally, but the minimal risk and cost to Argentina he had envisioned at the outset proved to be illusory. The resulting attack by Paraguay on Brazilian and Argentine provinces sparked the long and devastating Paraguayan War.|$|E
5|$|The second divisional game of {{the year}} for the 3–0 Bears, looking for their first 4–0 start in seven seasons, took place at Ford Field against the 2–1 Detroit Lions. Since 2001, the Bears had won 17 of the {{meetings}} between the two, compared to Detroit's 9. The Bears defense, ranked 19th in scoring defense with 24.7 points per game and 25th in yards allowed with 383.0, had {{to keep up with the}} Lions' 4th-ranked offense, who recorded 410.7 yards per game 27.3 PPG, sixth in the league. The Lions also had running back Reggie Bush return from a knee injury; Bush had recorded 260 yards and a touchdown in the first two games. However, the Lions' leading receiver Nate Burleson broke his arm in a car accident, which meant additional focus on Calvin Johnson for the Bears. <b>Expectations</b> <b>were</b> for Charles Tillman to cover Johnson, who was limited by Tillman to 15 catches, no touchdowns and an average of 62.3 receiving yards in the last three games. Although Tillman had suffered groin and knee injuries that left him questionable for the game, he was later listed as active against the Lions. However, Johnson recorded 40 catches for 20+ yards in 2012, and the Bears allowed the Steelers to gain 20 yards or more in nine plays. To attempt to combat Johnson, the Bears switched from the pressure defense run in the first three games to the cover 2. In the battle on the line of scrimmage, the Bears had to contain Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley, while the Lions had to protect Matthew Stafford from Julius Peppers and Corey Wootton. Offensively, the Bears also had to survive the crowd, who helped the Bears commit nine false start penalties in 2011.|$|E
