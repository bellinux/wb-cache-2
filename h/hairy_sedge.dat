40|$|The soils in {{sessile oak}} forests were studied at three localities {{in the region}} of Northeast Serbia. Brownised dystrict humus-siliceous soil was studied on gneiss in M. U. "Zlatica" - N. P. "Đerdap", in the forest of sessile oak with fescue grass (Quercetum montanum subass. festucetosum heterophyllae). Dystric acid brown soil on gneiss was studied {{in the region of}} F. E. "Severni Kučaj", M. U. "Ravna Reka", in the {{community}} of sessile oak and hornbeam (Querco-Carpinetum moesiacum), and in the region of the Teaching Base "Majdanpečka Domena" in M. U. "Crna Reka - Pek", in the forest of sessile oak with <b>hairy</b> <b>sedge</b> (Quercetum montanum subass. caricetosum pilosae) on schist's. Eutric brown soil was studied on amphibolite schist and on basic and neutral eruptive rocks in the region of N. P. "Đerdap", in M. U. "Zlatica", in the typical sessile oak forest (Quercetum montanum subass. tipicum) ...|$|E
