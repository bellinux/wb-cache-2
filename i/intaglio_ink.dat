In 1890, the company went public as an aktieselskab called the [...] "Danske Bogtrykkeres Farvefabrik", but he continued as General Manager. In 1896, he presented the first moving pictures in Denmark in a wooden structure called the [...] "Panorama" [...] at the square in front of Copenhagen's city hall. His building and equipment were lost to a suspicious fire, but he soon re-established his shows (renamed the [...] "Kineoptikon") at his Panoptikon. His activities made him a wealthy man, but also ensured that his output as a painter was rather small. Just {{before his death in}} 1912, he and his second wife, Oline, created the [...] "Vilhelm Pachts Kunstnerboligs Legat" [...] (Artist-Dwelling Legacy), which turned his mansion, [...] "Pachts Bo", into housing for indigent artists.|$|E

40|$|Includes {{digitized}} {{images in}} JPEG and TIFF formats. Corrosive Accretions are directly influenced by my {{fascination with the}} cycles of decay and growth in the environment. Rusted metal surfaces continually attract my attention. The geometric shapes I use {{give a sense of}} human order and structure to the work and create a formal contrast to the textural fields in these unique (one of a kind) prints. The surfaces found in my work have been inspired by the Texturologies of Jean Dubuffet, with their geological sensibility and their juxtaposition of textures, as well as the successive layers of paper. Helen Frankenthaler has been referred to as an intuitive and natural painter, and her experimentation and spontaneity have influenced me. The overall patterning of Jackson Pollock's Drip Paintings, with their skeins of layered colors, the suggested layering in Robert Rauschenberg's prints, and Ron Davis' geometric illusions have given me direction. To achieve the painterly textures, I cover my zinc etching plate with hard ground and drip solvent (kerosene or lacquer thinner) on it in a controlled manner. It is then etched in a strong nitric acid solution, aquatinted by spraying it with lacquer and etched again to create the tonal values. This process is repeated three or four times. Finally, I coat the plate with soft ground, imbed it with foil to create a network of fine lines, remove the foil and etch. The finished plate is <b>intaglio</b> <b>inked</b> and relief rolled for the initial printing on the press. In <b>intaglio</b> <b>inking,</b> ink is forced into the etched (grooved) surfaces of the plate and the top surfaces are wiped clean. (See more in text. ...|$|R

40|$|Ink {{analysis}} {{is an important}} component in the forensic investigation of questioned documents. This study explores the ability of Raman microspectroscopy to differentiate between the chemical components in printing inks of different brand, color, and type using the 532 nm and 785 nm excitation wavelengths. Spectra were collected from 320 different colored inkjets, toners, offset, and intaglio inks. After collecting the data, each spectrum underwent several comparisons to construct confusion matrices from which discrimination capability percentages were calculated. The results show that Raman microspectroscopy is best suited for differentiating among the inkjet and <b>intaglio</b> <b>ink</b> types and offers the highest discrimination capabilities for yellow and magenta colored inks. Additionally, Raman microspectroscopy was able to identify the pigments copper phthalocyanine and carbon black in some inks. Raman microspectroscopy offers a nondestructive, discriminative technique that requires little sample preparation and small sample size. The potential exists to identify the manufacturer of certain inks using this technique, making it an important method for use in a forensic laboratory...|$|E

This is glued to the sand paper using intensive solar heat. Ink is then applied to the resultant images by the <b>intaglio</b> <b>inking</b> process. any link in excess is wiped off with a dry cloth. This is later taken to the press to register the relief already created by the glue on a soaked and semi-dried cartridge printing paper. Finally, the registered impressions are painted, using pastel oil to achieve the desired forms by the artist.|$|R

40|$|Improvements in {{printing}} {{technology and the}} wide accessibility of advanced printers has resulted {{in an increase in}} counterfeiting. Of particular interest to forensic document examiners, ink analysis of security documents has emerged as an important tool for the analysis, comparison, and association of inks to a potential production source. In this study, methods were developed for Py-GC/MS, ATR-FTIR, DART-MS, and MALDI-MS analyses of printing inks of four classes: 78 inkjet inks, 76 toners, 79 offset <b>inks,</b> and 86 <b>intaglio</b> <b>inks</b> in order to generate information on the organic chemical characterization of the inks to determine the ability to associate and discriminate the inks for uses in security document examinations. The suite of analytical techniques evaluated in the study focused on having the following analytical characteristics: 1) rapid analysis time, 2) little-to-no sample preparation, 3) minimal destructiveness to the sample, 4) allow for association of inks with the same source of origin as well as discrimination of inks originating from different sources. As a result of this study, a novel searchable library database of inks was developed for use with each analytical chemical method that allows for data fusion.

50|$|To print an <b>intaglio</b> plate, <b>ink</b> {{is applied}} to the surface by wiping and/or dabbing the plate to push the ink into the {{recessed}} lines, or grooves. The plate is then rubbed with tarlatan cloth to remove most of the excess ink. The final smooth wipe is often done with newspaper or old public phone book pages, leaving ink only in the incisions. A damp piece of paper is placed on top of the plate, so that when going through the press the damp paper will be able to be squeezed into the plate's ink-filled grooves. The paper and plate are then covered by a thick blanket to ensure even pressure when going through the rolling press. The rolling press applies very high pressure through the blanket to push the paper into the grooves on the plate. The blanket is then lifted, revealing the paper and printed image.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Hayter moved Atelier 17 to New York City and taught printmaking at the New School. Artists such as Jackson Pollock, Mauricio Lasansky and Mark Rothko made prints at the New York Atelier 17. During the war, Hayter collaborated with British artist, historian and poet Roland Penrose and others in setting up a camouflage training unit. [...] He also firstproduced finished prints with the method he called “simultaneous color printing,” where color was added to <b>inked</b> <b>intaglio</b> plates by means such as color-ink-soaked rags, stencils, or rolling a thicker, more viscous ink over a thinner ink, where the thicker ink is rejected and adheres only to the surface surrounding the first ink.|$|R
50|$|Printing a {{photogravure}} {{is similar}} to printing any other intaglio plate, especially a finely etched aquatint. A stiff, oily <b>intaglio</b> printing <b>ink</b> {{is applied to the}} whole surface of the plate with a rubber brayer, or a small, stiff squeegee, or a rolled tamper. The plate is then gently wiped with tarlatans to remove the excess ink and drive it into the recesses (wells). It is finally wiped with the fatty part of the palm of the hand in quick glancing strokes. This removes all remaining ink from the polished highlights and high points and leaves ink only in the etched recesses. After the edges are cleaned, the plate is placed on the printing bed of an intaglio press. It is covered with a sheet of dampened rag paper and then two to three layers of thin wool blankets. It is then run through the press at high pressure. The high pressure pushes the fibers of the dampened paper into the wells of the plate which then transfers the ink onto the paper thereby creating the impression. The paper is carefully peeled off the plate and placed between blotters and weighted so it will dry flat. The plate can now be re-inked for another impression or it can be cleaned for storage.|$|R
5000|$|In 1707 Le Blon {{issued a}} short {{publication}} in Dutch on {{the forms of}} the human body.5 In 1708 and 1709 he {{is known to have}} made colorant mixing experiments in Amsterdam and in 1710 he made his first color prints with yellow, red, and blue plates.2 While in Amsterdam he became acquainted with Arnold Houbraken, who quoted him as a source of information on German painters for his Schouburg, later published after Houbraken's death in 1718. Le Blon's wife died in 1716 and in 1717 he moved to London where he received royal patents for the three-color printing process and a three-color tapestry weaving process. The tapestry process involved using white, yellow, red, blue, and black fibers to create images.3 The printing process involved using three different <b>intaglio</b> plates, <b>inked</b> in different colours. In 1722 he published a small book, Coloritto, in French and English.6 In it he stated that “Painting can represent all visible objects with three colors, yellow, red, and blue” (pp. 6, 7). During his stay in England he produced several dozen of three- and four-colored images in multiple copies that initially sold well in England and on the continent. In the long run his enterprise did not succeed, however, and Le Blon left England in 1735, moving to Paris where he continued producing prints by his method. During his last years several sequences of prints were produced and sold showing the different steps of his printing process, such as a portrait of the French Cardinal de Fleury.7 In 1740 he began work on a collection of anatomical prints for which he had a solid list of subscribers. When he died in 1741 in Paris he left a 4½ year-old daughter, Margueritte, as sole heir.1 A detailed description of Le Blon’s work was published in 1756 by Antoine Gautier de Montdorge who befriended him during his final years in Paris.8 ...|$|R
50|$|While {{working at}} Atelier 17, Krishna Reddy was {{instrumental}} in developing a new printing process to produce multi-colored prints from a single printing matrix by exploiting the viscosity and tackiness of the inks, subsequently named viscosity printing. Sticky and thick ink does not roll {{down on top of}} oily, runny ink, but oily and runny ink does roll down on top of sticky and thick. Inks of different tack and viscosity are employed to edition multi-colored prints off of deeply etched and carved metal printing plates. This process reveals the three dimensionality of the printing matrix to a significant degree. In the case of a printing matrix with three distinct areas; textured, original surface, and areas that have been smoothly etched to a lower level, each area will print in a different color. The matrix is inked and wiped as an <b>intaglio</b> using etching <b>ink</b> for the first color. A hard roller with slightly runny ink is used to put a layer of ink onto the original surface for the second color. Etching ink is often fairly viscous, but has very low tack so the second color does not adhere to the textured areas. A soft roller with stiff ink is rolled over the entire plate for the third color. The matrix is printed just like any intaglio. When this is carefully done each color is distinct and the process is repeatable. Each step in this process is sensitive to the point that most printmakers employ it for producing monotypes and monoprints rather than editions.|$|R
