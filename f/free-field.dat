The direction of a sound in space (see sound localization) is determined by the brain when it analyses the interaction of incoming sound with head and external ears. A sound arising to one side reaches the near ear before the far ear (creating an interaural time difference, ITD), and will also be louder at the near ear (creating an interaural level difference, ILD - also known as interaural intensity difference, IID). These binaural cues allow sounds to be lateralized. Although conventional stereo headphone signals make used of ILDs (not ITDs) the sound is not perceived as being externalized.|$|E

[...] In 2015, an anechoic chamber on the campus of Microsoft broke the world record with a measurement of &minus;20.6 dBA.

50|$|The {{underwater}} {{nuclear tests}} Wahoo and Umbrella gathered scientific data {{that helped the}} Department of Defense understand the effects of nuclear weapons on Navy ships. Some of the key points found were that underwater nuclear blasts create less fallout due to the absorption of radioactive material {{in the water and}} vaporized droplets.(76) Direct gamma radiation was found to be extremely low, but the base surge was found to be highly radioactive as it passed measurement devices. Smaller radiation concentrations followed in waves mimicking the initial base surge. Almost all <b>free-field</b> radiation activity was found to disappear after fifteen minutes allowing for return to normal operations. The impact of shock waves was less than prior expected. The damage from the shockwave was found to be negligible on the destroyers at the ranges tested, but equipment failure from the blast could immobilize the ships. The preliminary tests of explosive tapered charges were proved to simulate the shock waves of a nuclear device using the data gathered.|$|E

50|$|Both compression-driven and blast-driven shock {{tubes are}} {{currently}} used for scientific {{as well as}} military applications. Compressed-gas driven shock tubes are more easily obtained and maintained in laboratory conditions; however, {{the shape of the}} pressure wave is different from a blast wave in some important respects and may not be suitable for some applications. Blast-driven shock tubes generate pressure waves that are more realistic to <b>free-field</b> blast waves. However, they require facilities and expert personnel for handling high explosives. Also, in addition to the initial pressure wave, a jet effect caused by the expansion of compressed gases (compression-driven) or production of rapidly expanding gases (blast-driven) follows and may transfer momentum to a sample after the blast wave has passed. More recently, laboratory scale shock tubes driven by fuel-air mixtures have been developed that produce realistic blast waves and can be operated in more ordinary laboratory facilities. Because the molar volume of gas is much less, the jet effect is a fraction of that for compressed-gas driven shock tubes. To date, the smaller size and lower peak pressures generated by these shock tubes make them most useful for preliminary, nondestructive testing of materials, validation of measurement equipment such as high speed pressure transducers, and for biomedical research as well as military applications.|$|E
50|$|With speakers, the {{opposite}} is true. A flat low-frequency response is hard to obtain—except in free space high above ground, or in a very large and anechoic chamber that is free from reflections down to 20 Hz. Until recently, {{it was not possible}} to achieve high levels at frequencies down to 20 Hz without high levels of harmonic distortion. Even today, the best speakers are likely to generate around 1 to 3% of total harmonic distortion, corresponding to 30 to 40 dB below fundamental. This is not good enough, given the steep rise in loudness (rising to as much as 24 dB per octave) with frequency revealed by the equal-loudness curves below about 100 Hz. A good experimenter must ensure that trial subjects really hear the fundamental and not harmonics—especially the third harmonic, which is especially strong as a speaker cone's travel becomes limited as its suspension reaches the limit of compliance. A possible way around the problem is to use acoustic filtering, such as by resonant cavity, in the speaker setup. A flat <b>free-field</b> high-frequency response up to 20 kHz, on the other hand, is comparatively easy to achieve with modern speakers on-axis. These effects must be considered when comparing results of various attempts to measure equal-loudness contours.|$|E
