5|$|Speaking is {{the default}} {{modality}} for language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other {{components of the}} vocal apparatus, the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language. The study of the genetic bases for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that <b>has</b> <b>definitely</b> been implicated in language production is FOXP2, which may cause a kind of congenital language disorder if affected by mutations.|$|E
5|$|The Sulu bleeding-heart is {{considered}} to be critically endangered by the IUCN. The Sulu bleeding-heart has always been considered a rare bird, and only two specimens, both males, have ever been taken of the species. The specimens, collected in October 1891 on the small islet of Tataan, are the last time anyone <b>has</b> <b>definitely</b> seen the Sulu bleeding-heart alive. The bleeding-heart was searched for 22 days in December 1971 and briefly in September 1991 without success. Most of Tawi-Tawi's forests were cleared by August 1994, and the Sulu bleeding-heart may well be extirpated on the mainland. However, an ethnobiological survey in 1995 generated reports that the bleeding-heart survives and is regularly seen on the nearby islets of Tandubatu, Dundangan, and Baliungan. It was also reported that the species was quite common until the 1970s. Despite this, an expedition in 2009 failed to find any signs of the species or discover a new report of the species' continued existence. The islets it reportedly survives on may also be too small to support a viable population. Any surviving population of Sulu bleeding-hearts is likely to be small, possibly numbering fewer than 50 birds, and would be threatened by continued habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting. As the Mindanao and Luzon bleeding-hearts are popular cagebirds, any bleeding-heart found on Tawi-Tawi could also be an escaped bleeding-heart instead of the indigenous Sulu bleeding-heart. There are no protected areas in the Sulu Archipelago, and other than two environmental education initiatives in the 1990s nothing has been done to protect any surviving population.|$|E

25|$|A {{change has}} also come over Voigt's voice lately, though it's {{hard to tell}} if it's from weight loss or normal aging—controversy still rages over whether Maria Callas's drastic diets contributed to her rapid vocal decline. Not that Voigt as yet {{exhibits}} any of Callas's technical problems: Her voice continues to be reliably supported and under control. What is noticeable, however—earlier this season in Verdi's La Forza del Destino and now in Tosca—is a marked thinning of quality {{at the very center}} of the instrument, together with a slight acidity and tightening of the tone that <b>has</b> <b>definitely</b> taken the youthful bloom off, especially at the top.|$|E

[...] In May 2017, a television series named Judge Dredd: Mega-City One was announced to be in development by IM Global Television and Rebellion. In August 2017, Urban stated he was in discussion to star in the series.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Chelsea" [...] is a bubblegum pop and {{new wave}} track, {{referencing}} {{the music of}} the 1980s and 1990s.

500|$|Prior to the film's 2008 release, Hayden Christensen {{reflected}} {{on the possibility of}} one or more sequels: [...] "This <b>has</b> <b>definitely</b> been set up {{in a way that will}} allow for more films, and Doug has been careful to make sure that he's created characters that will have room to grow." [...] Lucas Foster during production of the film stated in an interview: [...] "The ideas got so large, that they really couldn't fit into, you know, one or two movies, they needed to evolve over at least three movies. So we planned the story out over three movies and then we sliced it up in such a way as to leave room for the other two movies." ...|$|E

He believed that showing the difference in the new album was important in picking the single. He did not want to put another dance song so that his fans do not assume that the entire album consisted of uptempo songs. He concluded that [...] "growing up <b>has</b> <b>definitely</b> taken place. My music has always been a representation of who I am and I guess I speak differently, my demeanour is different." ...|$|E

Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode an [...] "A", praising its cliffhanger ending and [...] "good storytelling". Handlen felt that the episode dealt with themes familiar to the series, but in a manner which did not appear repetitive; and again noted Jeremiah Smith's confrontation with The Smoking Man as a highlight.|$|E

500|$|Following Metallica's {{mainstream}} {{breakthrough in}} 1991, Mustaine stripped down Megadeth's sound, though the music remained as technically perfectionist as their previous releases. Drummer Nick Menza explained: [...] "Metallica <b>has</b> <b>definitely</b> {{opened the doors}} for other bands to step through. We're obviously the next band to step through that doorway." [...] Musically, Countdown to Extinction saw Megadeth beginning to incorporate more melody and mid-tempos into its traditional sound. Bassist David Ellefson noted that the band's goal was to [...] "create music that had more of a groove to it," [...] capitalizing on the melodic playing style employed by Friedman, and further assisted by the input of producer Norman.
