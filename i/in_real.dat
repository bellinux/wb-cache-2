5|$|Anna Schwartz {{collaborated with}} Friedman to produce one of monetarism's major works, A Monetary History of the United States (1963), which linked money {{supply to the}} {{business}} cycle. The Keynesians of the 1950s and 60s had adopted the view that monetary policy does not impact aggregate output or the business cycle based on evidence that, during the Great Depression, interest rates had been extremely low but output remained depressed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that Keynesians only looked at nominal rates and neglected the role inflation plays <b>in</b> <b>real</b> interest rates, which had been high {{during much of the}} Depression. <b>In</b> <b>real</b> terms, monetary policy had effectively been contractionary, putting downward pressure on output and employment, even though economists looking only at nominal rates thought monetary policy had been stimulative.|$|E
