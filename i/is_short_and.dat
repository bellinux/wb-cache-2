5|$|Chapter 3 <b>is</b> <b>short,</b> <b>and</b> {{opens with}} a list of eight asanas (postures), {{followed}} by the description of each one. The asanas are of two types: one set is for meditative contemplation, and the other for cleansing the body. Both are said to be important in the journey of yoga. Different asanas focus on different organ groups. Of the eight asanas, the text discusses two variations each for the Swastikasana and the Mukta Sirsasana in verses 3.3–5 and 3.13–14 respectively, with claims that each asana helps cleanse the body when these are practiced with Yamas and Niyamas.|$|E
5|$|David C. Parker in 2004 {{argued that}} {{manuscript}} was written later the 6th century, {{because it has}} a small number of square letters, and the handwriting is not typical for the 6th century. Some letters were compressed (Μ, Δ, Ε), the bar over the letter Τ <b>is</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> the letter Υ is written in several ways. According to Parker the manuscript should be dated to the 7th century.|$|E
5|$|The IEEE 802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE) {{standard}} specifies a {{more elaborate}} power negotiation scheme than powered USB. It operates at 48VDC and can supply more power (up to 12.95W, PoE+ 25.5W) over a cable up to 100meters compared to USB2.0, which provides 2.5W {{with a maximum}} cable length of 5meters. This has made PoE popular for VoIP telephones, security cameras, wireless access points, and other networked devices within buildings. However, USB is cheaper than PoE provided that the distance <b>is</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> power demand is low.|$|E

50|$|Some breeds {{of sheep}} and goats look similar, but they can usually be told apart because goat tails <b>are</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> usually point up, whereas sheep tails hang down and are usually longer and bigger - though some (like those of Northern European short-tailed sheep) <b>are</b> <b>short,</b> <b>and</b> longer ones <b>are</b> often docked.|$|R

5|$|The camas {{pocket gopher}} is, {{by a small}} margin, the largest member of its genus (Thomomys). The fur is a dull brown above and dark, leaden gray beneath. There are often patches of white on the chin, throat and around the anus, and it has blackish ear and nose markings. The {{external}} ear is a thickened rim of tissue. During the summer, the gopher's coat <b>is</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> coarse; winter pelage is longer and furrier. The coat of the young {{is similar to the}} adult summer coat, but with more sparsely distributed fur; the abdominal skin may be visible.|$|E
5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark has an elongated body, {{over half of}} which is comprised by the slender caudal peduncle. The snout <b>is</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> rounded, with the nares placed almost at the tip along {{with a pair of}} tiny barbels; there are grooves running from the nares to the mouth. There are 2635 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2132 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The teeth are small, with broad bases and triangular cusps. The eyes are oval in shape and elevated, with a large spiracle below each. The five pairs of gill slits are small, with the fourth and fifth very close together.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) <b>is</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> deep. The mental foramen, {{an opening}} {{at the front of}} the mandible, just before the first molar, opens to the side. The capsular process of the lower incisor, a raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, is well developed. The two masseteric ridges, to which some of the chewing muscles are attached, are entirely separate, joining only at their front edges, which are located below the first molar.|$|E

5|$|The only {{overlapping}} material between BMNH R3078 and the holotype of Cetiosauriscus leedsi is an ilium. However, in both specimens the ilium was {{preserved in}} insufficient ways. Since the only overlapping material {{was impossible to}} compare, Charig found that BMNH R3078 was of a different species and he named it Cetiosauriscus stewarti. Metacarpal 1 <b>is</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> massive, with the prominent process on {{the lower part of}} the posterior margin of the lateral face, a characteristic of the diplodocoids Diplodocus, Apatosaurus and Dicraeosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{flattened}} {{in general}} shape. The front part <b>is</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> broad. The broad interorbital region (located between the eyes) is hourglass-shaped, with squared edges and weakly developed beading. A postorbital ridge is present, obscuring the suture (joint) between the frontal and squamosal bones, a feature shared only with Holochilus among oryzomyines. The braincase is squarish. The interparietal bone is wide, {{but does not}} reach the squamosals on the sides. The zygomatic arches, which are well-developed, are furthest apart at the back and converge toward the front. The jugal bone is small.|$|E

Although the lightning is extremely hot, the duration <b>is</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> 90% of strike victims survive. Contrary to the popular idea that lightning does not strike twice in the same spot, some people have been struck by lightning over three times, and skyscrapers like the Empire State Building have been struck numerous times in the same storm.|$|E

5|$|Both dorsal fins are {{immediately}} preceded by stout, grooved spines, {{with the second}} much longer than the first. The small first dorsal fin has a rounded apex and a nearly straight trailing margin, with its origin lying behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is rather angular and has about double {{the area of the}} first, with its origin located opposite the midpoint of the pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are small and rounded. The pelvic fins are about as large as the second dorsal fin, with rounded tips and nearly straight trailing margins. The caudal peduncle <b>is</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> leads to a broad caudal fin comprising {{less than a quarter of}} the total length; the upper lobe has a convex upper margin leading to a squared-off tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is densely covered by tiny dermal denticles; each one is recurved and thorn-like, rising from an irregular star-shaped base. This species is a plain dark brown above, darkening to almost black below, with white dorsal fin spines. Juvenile sharks have white edges on the dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fins. Minute, luminescent dots are scattered about the skin without a regular pattern.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus brachytragos is a small, short-tailed Miniopterus {{with short}} and {{relatively}} thin fur. The fur of the upperparts is dark brown and {{the hairs on}} the underparts have buff tips. Miniopterus mahafaliensis is similar in color, but other small Malagasy Miniopterus are darker. The ears are haired above, but virtually naked below and end in a rounded tip. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) <b>is</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> has a broad base, sometimes with a crest at the side. It ends in a pointed to slightly rounded tip, which is covered with hairs that are not readily visible to the unaided eye. The short tragus easily distinguishes M.brachytragos from other Malagasy Miniopterus. The wing membrane is also brown, but the uropatagium (tail membrane) is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is relatively densely covered with hairs, particularly on the upper side. M.manavi and M.mahafaliensis also have a densely haired uropatagium, but in M.aelleni and M.griveaudi it is only sparsely haired or even mostly naked.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{are very}} large birds with very long bills characterised by a downcurved hook {{at the end}} of the upper mandible, and the {{attachment}} of a huge gular pouch to the lower. The slender rami of the lower bill and the flexible tongue muscles form the pouch into a basket for catching fish and, sometimes, rainwater, though in order not to hinder the swallowing of large fish, the tongue itself is tiny. They have a long neck and short stout legs with large, fully webbed feet. Although they are among the heaviest of flying birds, they are relatively light for their apparent bulk because of air pockets in the skeleton and beneath the skin enabling them to float high in the water. The tail <b>is</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> square. The wings are long and broad, suitably shaped for soaring and gliding flight, and have the unusually large number of 30 to 35 secondary flight feathers.|$|E

5|$|The heavy dagger-like bill is evenly tapered and greyish, {{sometimes}} {{having a}} black tip. The bill colour and angle distinguish this species from the yellow-billed loon. The neck <b>is</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> thick. It swims {{very low in}} the water, with sometimes only its head held above and horizontal to water. It must run across the water surface to get in flight. During flight, its head is slightly lower than its body, with its feet trailing behind. It has a skeletal structure {{made up of a}} number of solid bones (this is usual for the Gaviiformes and penguins but unlike most flying birds which have bones with extensive pneumatization, hollow and filled with air to make the lighter), which adds weight but helps in diving.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the thornback guitarfish is heart-shaped, slightly {{longer than it}} is wide, and thick towards the front. The snout <b>is</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> broad, with a blunt tip protruding slightly from the disc. The eyes are small and widely spaced; the spiracles are larger than the eyes and lie closely behind. The wide nostrils are preceded by moderately large, broad flaps of skin. The mouth is wide and gently arched; there are a pair of creases running from the mouth corners to the nostrils, enclosing a roughly trapezoidal area. The lower lip is inscribed by a deep furrow that wraps around the mouth corners. The small teeth have low crowns that may be sharp to blunt, and are arranged in 68–82 rows in the upper jaw and 64–78 rows in the lower jaw. The five pairs of gill slits are small and located beneath the disc.|$|E
5|$|The rostrum (front {{part of the}} skull) <b>is</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> blunt in both M.macpheei and M.brevicaudata, {{contrasting}} {{with the}} condition in other Microgale, but the rostrum of M.brevicaudata is distinctly more tapered at the front, whereas that of M.macpheei is more blunt at the front. Unlike other Microgale, M.brevicaudata and M.macpheei lack gaps (diastemata) between the premolars. M.macpheei had larger, more robust teeth than M.brevicaudata. In both species, the mesiostyle and distostyle, two crests, on the fourth premolar (P4) and the molars are reduced relative to the condition in other Microgale. M.macpheei lacks {{an extension of the}} protocone cusp on the lingual (inner) side of the third upper premolar (P3) and P4, present in M.brevicaudata, and has the paracone cusp on P4 less well-developed. On the other hand, the front part of the ectostyle crest on P4 is larger. The relative lengths of some of the crests on the two last molars also differ between the two species.|$|E

5|$|The shoulderblade or scapula <b>is</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> wide, {{its length}} about 6.8 times the minimum width; {{this is a}} rare and basal trait within Tetanurae. Its top curves {{slightly}} to the rear in side view. On the lower outer side of the blade a broad ridge is present, running from just below the shoulder joint to about midlength where it gradually merges with the blade surface. The middle front edge over about 30% of its length is thinned forming a slightly protruding crest. The scapula constitutes {{about half of the}} shoulder joint, which is oriented obliquely sideways and to below. The coracoid is in all known specimens fused with the scapula into a scapulocoracoid, lacking a visible suture. The coracoid as such is an oval bone plate, with its longest side attached to the scapula. It is pierced by a large oval foramen but the usual boss for the attachment of the upper arm muscles is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{tendency}} to kill subordinates on a whim, the Joker has no difficulty attracting henchmen with a seemingly infinite cash supply and intimidation: {{they are too}} afraid of their employer to refuse his demands that they wear red clown noses or laugh at macabre jokes. Even with his unpredictability and lack of superhuman powers, the 2007 limited series Salvation Run sees hundreds of villains fall under his spell {{because they are more}} afraid of him than the alternative: Luthor. Batman #186 (1966) introduced the Joker's first sidekick: the one-shot character, Gaggy Gagsworth, who <b>is</b> <b>short,</b> <b>and</b> dressed like a clown; the character was later resurrected as an enemy of his replacement, Harley Quinn. Introduced in the 1992 animated series, Quinn is the Joker's former Arkham psychiatrist who develops an obsessive infatuation with him and dons a red-and-black harlequin costume to join him in the 1999 graphic novel Batman: Harley Quinn. Although Quinn loves the Joker, he is obsessed with Batman and uses her to achieve his goals at her expense. Despite violent abuse, she returns to him. The Joker is sometimes shown to keep hyenas as pets; this trait was introduced in the 1977 animated series The New Adventures of Batman. A 1976 issue of Batman Family introduced Duela Dent as the Joker's daughter, though her parentage claim was later proven to be false.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Brown {{expanded}} the character set {{to include more}} features; in the revised version: a comparatively short skull with a high helmet-like crest formed by nasals, prefrontals and frontals; the nasals not being separated in front by premaxillaries; a narrow beak, expanded section {{in front of the}} elongated nares; a small narial opening; a vertebral formula of 15 cervicals, 19 dorsals, 8 sacrals, and 61+ caudals; possession of dorsal spines of a medium height; high anterior caudal spines; long chevrons; long scapulae, possessing a blade of medium width; a radius considerably longer than humerus; comparatively short metacarpals; an anteriorly decurved ilium; a long ischium with a foot-like terminal expansion; a pubis with an anterior blade that <b>is</b> <b>short</b> <b>and</b> broadly expanded at end; a femur that is longer than the tibia; the phalanges of pes are short; that the integument over the sides and tail composed of polygonal tuberculate scales without pattern but graded in size {{in different parts of the}} body; and a belly with longitudinal rows of large conical limpet-like scales separated by uniformly large polygonal tubercles. Again, the presumed traits of the snout are incorrect because Brown confused the praemaxillae with the nasal bones and the nasal bones with the frontals. Most of the postcranial traits are today known to be shared with other lambeosaurines.|$|E
