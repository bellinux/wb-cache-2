5|$|A {{spin-off}} prequel show, First of the Summer Wine, premiered on BBC1 in 1988. The new programme {{was written}} by Roy Clarke and used different actors to follow {{the activities of the}} principal characters <b>from</b> <b>Last</b> of the Summer Wine {{in the months leading up}} to World War II. Unlike its mother show, First of the Summer Wine was not filmed in Holmfirth. Period music was used instead of Ronnie Hazlehurst's score to create a more World War II era atmosphere. New supporting characters were added to those <b>from</b> <b>Last</b> of the Summer Wine. Peter Sallis and Jonathan Linsley were the only actors from the original series to appear in the spin-off: Sallis played the father of his own character from the original show and Linsley appeared during the second series as a different character.|$|E

5|$|Although the 77,777 {{copies of}} Advent Pieces: Limited that were {{released}} in Japan sold out {{months in advance}} of the official release date, Last Order received a negative fan response due to changes in content and presentation from the original Final Fantasy VII game, and because of this, the crew working on Crisis Core avoided recreating certain scenes <b>from</b> <b>Last</b> Order.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{elimination}} of the United States ice hockey team, American television stations needed to fill airtime and chose to focus on the Jamaican bobsleigh team in the four-man event. The first run ended poorly, as when Dudley Stokes jumped into the bobsleigh, the push-bar in the sleigh broke, resulting in the team coming in third <b>from</b> <b>last</b> in 24th place. On their second attempt, the team ranked second to last, due in part to White struggling to crouch down properly in his seat, remaining almost upright through the first corner.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, the Summer Wine Appreciation Society {{asked their}} members for their {{favourite}} musical themes <b>from</b> <b>Last</b> of the Summer Wine. Ronnie Hazlehurst used the resulting list for an independently released CD collection, which was released {{under the name}} Last of the Summer Wine: Music from the TV Show. BBC Radio released audio-only versions of episodes starting in 1995. Peter Sallis provided narration {{to compensate for the}} loss of the televised visual elements. All twelve audio episodes were released in CD format.|$|E
5|$|Between September 2 and September 17, the Breeders {{performed}} in eleven cities, among which were St. Louis, Denver, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. Support groups the Funs and the Neptunas opened {{for them at}} five and six of these shows, respectively. The band then played at the Hollywood Bowl concert, and wrapped up the tour on September 20 at the Goose Island 312 Urban Block Dance Party event in Chicago. In addition to their new songs, they performed numerous selections <b>from</b> <b>Last</b> Splash and Pod (1990). The tour received good reviews from critics; appraisal included comments that the performances were rousing, and that the band was as good as—or better than—in its heyday.|$|E
5|$|Black {{remained}} in the starting rotation {{at the beginning of}} the 1944 Philadelphia Athletics season, despite possibility of him being drafted into the United States Army for World War II. He was rejected for military service after a physical examination on June 22, and remained with the team throughout the season. His win total improved <b>from</b> <b>last</b> season; however, he went a span of about a month, from June 28 until late July, without a victory. He finished the season with a 1012 record, a 4.06 ERA, and 27 games started, second highest on the team behind Bobo Newsom. At the end of the season, there were rumors that manager Connie Mack was planning to trade Black and Frankie Hayes to Cleveland for Jim Bagby, Jr. and Jeff Heath, though Mack stated that there was no substance to the rumors.|$|E

5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 31,000 tickets. Cardiff fans would be {{housed in the}} East End of the stadium, while Liverpool fans were allocated the West End of the stadium. Ticket prices were increased <b>from</b> <b>last</b> year's final, with the most expensive tickets costing £90 up £4 from the previous year. The least expensive tickets cost £40, which was £2 more than last year. It was decided that before the match started national anthems would not be played. This {{decision was made to}} avoid spectators jeering the anthems, as happened during the 2008 FA Cup Final between Portsmouth and Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the failure}} to deliver a winning season, Vanderlinden did oversee {{substantive}} improvement in the program. In 1998, the Terrapins {{were one of the}} most improved teams in defense, scoring defense, passing defense, and rushing. In 1999, Maryland allowed a conference low of 11 sacks compared with 56 in 1997. In that same period, Maryland also improved <b>from</b> <b>last</b> to first in the conference in rushing, {{due in large part to}} Heisman Trophy candidate and school career rushing leader LaMont Jordan. During Vanderlinden's tenure, Maryland also recruited several key players who were instrumental in the team's later success.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his release}} from the Browns, Hornsby was unable to retire because he had lost so much money {{gambling}} over the years. He signed as a player-coach with the Baltimore Orioles of the International League in 1938 before leaving them to play for and manage the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern Association {{for the rest of}} the season. Hornsby then returned to the Orioles to manage them for 1939, but he did not return to the club following the season. Halfway through 1940, he signed to manage the Oklahoma City Indians of the Texas League. He led them <b>from</b> <b>last</b> place to the Texas League playoffs, where they fell to the Houston Buffaloes in four games. Hornsby began 1941 managing the Indians once again, but he resigned in the middle of the season. In November, he became the general and field manager of the Fort Worth Cats, also of the Texas league. Fort Worth finished in third place and made the playoffs in 1942, but they were eliminated in the first round by the Shreveport Sports.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, it was {{announced}} that long-time supporting actors Ken Kitson and Louis Emerick had returned to Holmfirth to reprise their roles as Police Constables Cooper and Walsh in the pilot for a new proposed spin-off, Cooper and Walsh. Alan J.W. Bell as well as crew <b>from</b> <b>Last</b> of the Summer Wine were involved in the creation of two short films while Kitson and Emerick appealed for funding through crowd-sourcing sites in the hopes of gaining enough support to produce a feature film featuring the duo or even a television series. Associate Producer Terry Bartlam believed there was enough of a cope with Cooper and Walsh that they could carry their own series and that this spin-off could be the answer to those who believed Last of the Summer Wine should have been given a proper ending.|$|E
5|$|Michael Lynch and Richard Oram portray David {{as having}} little initial {{connection}} with the culture and society of the Scots; but both likewise argue that David became increasingly re-Gaelicised in the later stages of his reign. Whatever the case, David's claim to be heir to the Scottish kingdom was doubtful. David {{was the youngest of}} eight sons of the fifth <b>from</b> <b>last</b> king. Two more recent kings had produced sons. William fitz Duncan, son of King Donnchad II, and Máel Coluim, son of the last king Alexander, both preceded David in terms of the slowly emerging principles of primogeniture. However, unlike David, neither William nor Máel Coluim had the support of Henry. So when Alexander died in 1124, the aristocracy of Scotland could either accept David as King, or face war with both David and Henry I.|$|E
5|$|Peter Forsberg's number 21 {{became the}} fourth jersey number retired by the Avs on opening night, a contest Colorado would lose to Detroit 3–0. Colorado {{redeemed}} themselves in game {{two of the}} season on October 10, 2011, against the 2011 Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins. Varlamov negated all 30 shots registered by Boston and posted the fifth shutout of his career and first win as an Avalanche in the regular season. Milan Hejduk scored the game-winning goal and first goal of the season for the club in a 1–0 victory over the defending champions. In April 2012, The Avs were eliminated from playoff contention and finished 11th place in the Western Conference. Despite a 20-point improvement <b>from</b> <b>last</b> season's efforts, the team failed to reach {{the playoffs for the}} second straight year, the first time the Colorado club would do so in their 17 years playing in Denver. Head coach Joe Sacco signed a two-year contract extension shortly {{after the end of the}} season. Stand out rookie Gabriel Landeskog overtook Matt Duchene as the youngest in franchise history to lead the team in goals, scoring 22 in 82 games.|$|E

5|$|The team {{entered the}} season {{surrounded}} by questions {{of how they}} would overcome the late season collapse <b>from</b> <b>last</b> year and {{what it would take}} for Rich Rodriguez to return for a fourth year. On January 5, Michigan hired Dave Brandon to replace Bill Martin as its athletic director. Martin had previously announced his retirement during the 2009 season. Reaction to the hire was positive, but the hire also brought increased scrutiny upon Rich Rodriguez, as Brandon {{made it clear that he}} would do whatever was necessary to turn the program around from its recent slump.|$|E
5|$|When the NHL resumed for an {{abbreviated}} 2012–13 season, Oates and the Capitals struggled initially and won {{only two of}} their first 11 games. The team improved throughout the season, however, and went <b>from</b> <b>last</b> place in the Southeast Division to first; they won 15 of their final 19 games to win the division title. Oates' players praised his positive outlook and willingness {{to work closely with}} them as a primary reasons why the team was able to turn its season around. The Capitals were defeated {{in the first round of}} the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs, however, losing to the New York Rangers in seven games.|$|E
5|$|During Game 1 of the 2012 ALCS, Jeter {{broke his}} right ankle while {{attempting}} to field a ball. He {{was one of many}} Yankees to miss playing time during the club's 2013 campaign; 20 players were placed on the disabled list at least once. The team had an opportunity to win a wild-card playoff spot, but faded late in the season. It was only the second time since 1995 that New York did not qualify for postseason play. In the offseason, second baseman Robinson Canó departed New York for the Mariners in free agency, but the Yankees signed starting pitcher Masahiro Tanaka, who was coming off a 24–0 year with Japan's Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, to a seven-year contract. Rodriguez was suspended for the 2014 season by MLB for using performance-enhancing drugs. The 2014 Yankees, the last with Jeter in their lineup, fell four games short of a postseason berth with an 84–78 record. Despite signing several new hitters prior to the season, the team finished third <b>from</b> <b>last</b> in the AL in runs scored. The offense improved in 2015, ending the regular season with the second-most runs in MLB. New York gained a wild card berth with a second-place finish, but was defeated by the Houston Astros in a one-game playoff. The Yankees traded several veteran players during their 2016 season, and Rodriguez was released from his contract. The club had 84 wins, but missed the playoffs {{for the third time in}} four years. As the Yankees' on-field performance declined after 2009, their attendance and television ratings fell; revenue from ticket and luxury suite sales at Yankee Stadium decreased by more than 40percent from 2009 to 2016.|$|E
