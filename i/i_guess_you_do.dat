60|$|Judge Douglas has again, for, I believe, {{the fifth}} time, {{if not the}} seventh, in my presence, reiterated his charge of a {{conspiracy}} or combination between the National Democrats and Republicans. What evidence Judge Douglas has upon this subject I know not, inasmuch as he never favors us with any. I have said upon a former occasion, and I do not choose to suppress it now, that I {{have no objection to}} the division in the Judge's party. He got it up himself. It was all his and their work. He had, I think, a great deal {{more to do with the}} steps that led to the Lecompton Constitution than Mr. Buchanan had; though at last, when they reached it, they quarreled over it, and their friends divided upon it. I am very free to confess to Judge Douglas that I have no objection to the division; but I defy the Judge to show any evidence that I have in any way promoted that division, unless he insists on being a witness himself in merely saying so. I can give all fair friends of Judge Douglas here to understand exactly the view that Republicans take in regard to that division. Don't you remember how two years ago the opponents of the Democratic party were divided between Fremont and Fillmore? <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Any Democrat who remembers that division will remember also that he was at the time very glad of it, and then he will be able to see all there is between the National Democrats and the Republicans. What we now think of the two divisions of Democrats, you then thought of the Fremont and Fillmore divisions. That is all there is of it.|$|E

And <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not do that with major labels when you're an unknown artist. I didn't like anyone trying to change me though and A & R reps like to manipulate {{even though most of}} them are complete idiots. They kept telling me to write songs like Cinderella, Bon Jovi, and Poison. It was insulting to me. Why should I follow in their footsteps just because they are successful? ... Here's the pivotal reason I left L.A. Guns. Izzy Stradlin and I got busted together. Rumors shot around town that Guns N' Roses were going to lose their deal with Geffen. PolyGramfelt it was time to replace me before signing L.A. Guns to a deal." [...] —Black on why he was replaced. Later, in 1985, Guns and singer Paul Black reformed L.A. Guns with Mick Cripps and Nickey Alexander. Robert Stoddard, former The Dogs D'Amour singer, briefly became guitarist for the group, co-writing the song [...] "Nothing to Lose" [...] that appeared on L.A. Guns debut album. Initially, the group were to be called Faster Pussycat (later the name of another band; several of that band's members over the years were also in L.A. Guns) but soon re-adopted the L.A. Guns moniker. After writing material and playing shows, the group signed with PolyGram. Black was soon replaced by former Girl singer Phil Lewis while Kelly Nickels (formerly of Faster Pussycat) was added to the lineup.|$|E

60|$|We {{all know}} that, yet {{most of us}} are just foolish enough to make such a wish now and then. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> have <b>done</b> it. <b>I</b> know I have.
