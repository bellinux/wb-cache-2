5|$|Disaster Transport {{originally}} {{opened on}} May 11, 1985 as Avalanche Run and was entirely outdoors. It was built {{next to the}} beach, on the former spot of <b>Jumbo</b> <b>Jet</b> and later, WildCat. Many other rides also had to be relocated. The original ride cost $3.4 million: $1.9 million to manufacture and $1.5 million to install.|$|E
5|$|Following its debut, the 747 rapidly {{achieved}} iconic status, {{appearing in}} numerous film productions such as Airport 1975 and Airport '77 disaster films, Air Force One, Die Hard 2, and Executive Decision. Appearing in over 300 film productions the 747 {{is one of}} the most widely depicted civilian aircraft and is considered by many as one of the most iconic in film history. The aircraft entered the cultural lexicon as the original <b>Jumbo</b> <b>Jet,</b> a term coined by the aviation media to describe its size, and was also nicknamed Queen of the Skies.|$|E

5000|$|... 1971 saw the {{introduction}} of the Boeing 747-100 on transatlantic routes flying alongside the Boeing 707-320Cs. Sabena, like many other trans-Atlantic airlines, was satisfied with the Boeing 707s. For commercial reasons they recognised that they had to buy <b>jumbo</b> <b>jets</b> for their prestige services, notably New York JFK and as of the mid-seventies, Chicago O'Hare. Sabena purchased only two first generation <b>jumbo</b> <b>jets</b> and they continued to fly the 707 into the late 1970s.|$|R
5|$|Nine years later, the Russian Federation {{handed over}} {{transcripts}} of Soviet military communications {{that showed that}} at least two documented search and rescue (SAR) missions were ordered within a half-hour of the attack to the last Soviet verified location of the descending <b>jumbo</b> <b>jet,</b> over Moneron Island: The first search was ordered from Smirnykh Air Base in central Sakhalin at 18:47 UTC, nine minutes after KAL007 had disappeared from Soviet radar screens, and brought rescue helicopters from Khomutovo Air base (the civilian and military airport at Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City in southern Sakhalin), and Soviet Border Troops boats to the area.|$|E
25|$|<b>Jumbo</b> <b>Jet</b> was {{manufactured}} by notable roller coaster designer Anton Schwarzkopf, {{and was the}} first of the Jet Star 3 model in the <b>Jumbo</b> <b>Jet</b> line. The coaster was located in the same beachfront location where a wooden roller coaster called Cyclone once stood before. It was also the location that housed the now-defunct Disaster Transport, and indoor roller coaster, as well as the location where GateKeeper stands presently. While at Cedar Point, <b>Jumbo</b> <b>Jet</b> carried between 1.6 and 1.8 million passengers every year. <b>Jumbo</b> <b>Jet</b> was eventually replaced in 1979 by the new WildCat coaster. Although <b>Jumbo</b> <b>Jet</b> was only at Cedar Point for a short time, the roller coaster subsequently moved to a number of different amusement parks, including Palace Playland in Maine, Malmö Folkets Park in Sweden, Beoland in Russia, Dreamland in Belarus, and its present location of Chelyuskintsev Park also located in Belarus.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide-body}} aircraft {{is a large}} airliner {{with two}} passenger aisles, {{also known as a}} twin-aisle aircraft. As the world's first wide-body aircraft, the Boeing 747, also referred to as a <b>jumbo</b> <b>jet,</b> revolutionized international travel around the globe by making non-stop and long distance travel accessible for all. Joe Sutter, the chief engineer of the <b>jumbo</b> <b>jet</b> program at The Boeing Company designed the world's first wide-body aircraft, the Boeing 747, with its first test flight on February 9, 1969.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} stages, before {{the extent of}} the {{disaster}} was clear, Sri Lanka refused Israel's offers of aid, objecting to the inclusion of 60 Israeli soldiers in the 150-person mission planned by Israel's army, to set up field hospitals, including internal medicine and paediatric clinics, an Israeli army spokesman reported to BBC. Later, the Israeli humanitarian organization sent a <b>jumbo</b> <b>jet</b> carrying 18.5 tonnes of supplies to Colombo, however, and a rescue-and-recovery team from the Jewish ultra-Orthodox organization ZAKA arrived in Colombo with equipment used for identifying bodies, as well as body bags.|$|E
25|$|Kuwait Airways Flight 422 was a Boeing 747 <b>jumbo</b> <b>jet</b> hijacked {{en route}} from Bangkok, Thailand, to Kuwait on April 5, 1988, leading to a hostage crisis that lasted 16 days and {{encompassed}} three continents. The hijacking {{was carried out by}} several Lebanese guerillas who demanded the release of 17 Shi'ite Muslim prisoners being held by Kuwait for their role in the 1983 Kuwait bombings. During the incident the flight, initially forced to land in Iran, travelled 3,200 miles from Mashhad in northeastern Iran to Larnaca, Cyprus, and finally to Algiers.|$|E
50|$|Planned {{expansion}} of the airport will allow Airbus A380 <b>jumbo</b> <b>jets</b> to land at the airport; the Airport Authority of India is also planning to expand the international terminal to increase passenger traffic capacity.

50|$|DIA's sixth runway (16R/34L) is {{the longest}} {{commercial}} precision-instrument runway in North America with a length of 16000 ft. Compared to other DIA runways, the extra 4000 ft length allows fully loaded <b>jumbo</b> <b>jets</b> such as the Boeing 747 or Airbus A380 to take off in Denver's mile-high altitude during summer months, thereby providing unrestricted global access for any airline using DIA.|$|R
25|$|On November 11, 1971, an Iberia Airlines 747 <b>jumbo</b> <b>jet</b> {{en route}} from Madrid to New York City made an {{emergency}} landing at the airport due to a bomb threat. It {{was the first time}} a 747 had ever attempted an emergency landing at such a small airport. Even though the jet successfully landed, the runway was too short for the 747 to take off with passengers on board. The passengers were then flown to New York on three Air Canada DC9s, and early the next morning the 747 took off for New York. No bomb was ever found and the 241 passengers and 18 crew were unharmed.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} SAA's eight Boeing 747-400s, named Durban, arrived in South Africa on 19 January 1991. The airline was unusual in that two {{different}} turbofan engines were operated. Six Roll-Royce RB211-524H-powered examples were ordered; the other two, {{part of an}} unfulfilled Philippine Airlines order, had four General Electric CF6-80C2B5Fs each. Winglets, structural changes, as well as fuel-efficient engines enabled these aircraft to fly non-stop from South Africa to the East Coast of the United States. The arrival of Boeing's newest <b>jumbo</b> <b>jet</b> perhaps overshadowed the acquisition by SAA of the world's first commercial fly-by-wire airliner, the Airbus A320, to assist and enhance services within the country and on regional services. Boeing 767s arrived in August 1993 and flew on African, Southern European and Middle Eastern routes. They were retired within ten years.|$|E
25|$|Swissair was {{the second}} European airline to offer service to the People's Republic of China, {{introducing}} service to Beijing and Shanghai in 1975. In the same year, Swissair was the launch customer for the DC-9-51. In 1977 Swissair was the launch customer for the third DC-9 type, the DC-9-81 variant, now called the MD-80. Armin Baltensweiler had traveled to a meeting of McDonnell-Douglas' directorial board in St. Louis to convince them to further stretch the fuselage of the DC-9-51. Baltensweiler was called the “Father of the MD-80". In 1979 Swissair was the first company to order the Airbus A310-200 and the <b>jumbo</b> <b>jet</b> variant with a stretched upper deck, the Boeing 747-300. Also, the Fokker 100 short range aircraft and the three-engined MD-11 were aircraft for which Swissair was the launch customer. 1983 saw {{the replacement of the}} older DC-9s by MD-83s.|$|E
50|$|George H.W.
