25|$|The Willamette Valley {{ecoregion}} is a Level III ecoregion {{designated by}} the United States Environmental Protection Agency in the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington. Slightly larger than the Willamette Valley {{for which it is}} named, the ecoregion contains <b>fluvial</b> <b>terraces</b> and floodplains of the Willamette River system, scattered hills, buttes, and adjacent foothills. It is distinguished from the neighboring Coast Range, Cascades, and Klamath Mountains ecoregions by lower precipitation, lower elevation, less relief, and a different mosaic of vegetation. Mean annual rainfall is 37 to 60inches (96 to 152cm), and summers are generally dry. Historically, the region was covered by rolling prairies, oak savanna, coniferous forests, extensive wetlands, and deciduous riparian forests. Today, it contains the bulk of Oregon’s population, industry, commerce, and agriculture.

2500|$|The Blue Mountain Basins {{ecoregion}} {{is characterized}} by flat to rolling alluvial valleys containing floodplains, <b>fluvial</b> <b>terraces,</b> and scattered buttes in the Wallowa, Grande Ronde, and Baker valleys. The Wallowa Valley also includes outwash terraces, moraines, and a low elevation basalt plateau. Elevation varies from 2,600to5,000feet (792to1,524m). All three valleys are faultbounded grabens or depressions filled with sediments. The Wallowa and Grande Ronde valleys have a marine-moderated climate and moisture-retaining loess soils. The Baker Valley, located in the rain shadow of the Elkhorn Mountains, is drier and has areas of alkaline soil. All three valleys receive stream flow from the surrounding mountains.

40|$|Marine and <b>fluvial</b> <b>terrace</b> {{sequences}} {{near the}} Waitakere Ranges on the North Island of New Zealand have been surveyed, yielding {{an inventory of}} 13 fluvial and 12 marine terrace levels. Based on sparse tephra age control and correlation with the global palaeoclimatic record, rates of regional Quaternary uplift have been reconstructed. Between 1000 ka and 345 ka the time-averaged uplift rate was 0. 072 mm a¿ 1, between 345 ka and 50 ka it increased to 0. 278 mm a¿ 1, accelerating to 0. 42 mm a¿ 1 since 50 ka. The <b>fluvial</b> <b>terrace</b> sequence did not yield clear sedimentary records or other datable material. However, although others have disputed the existence of marine terraces in this study region, a pattern of accelerating regional uplift, superimposed onto glacio-eustatic sea-level changes, is substantiated as the only possible mechanism for maintaining the considerable relief and the active denudation processes inland. The observed uplift {{is similar to that}} in other regions where the uplift has been attributed to coupling between surface processes and lower-crustal flow, making this a likely mechanism in the North Island of New Zealand. Regarding the <b>fluvial</b> <b>terrace</b> sequence, the proposed general model is of an actively incising river, carving out on average one strath terrace every ~ 16, 000 years.

We use 26 Al and 10 Be concentrations to constrain the geomorphic evolution of these marine and continental landforms near the Choapa valley (31. 6 ° S). 10 Be ages for the shore platform indicate that this surface was repeatedly reoccupied during sea-level highstands between ~ 800 and 500 ka and uplifted after 500 ka. While 'zero erosion' ages for the pediment between ~ 600 and 300 ka only partly overlap the shore platform age range, more realistic exposure ages calculated for an erosion rate of 1 m/Ma are between ~ 945 and 475 ka, fitting the age range of the correlated shore platform. 10 Be concentrations of the high <b>fluvial</b> <b>terrace</b> are highly scattered evidencing vertical mixing of clasts probably due to slow lowering of the surface. Although {{it is not possible}} to determine an age for this landform, the scattering among its 10 Be concentrations implies that this marker is several hundreds of thousands of years old and that the high <b>fluvial</b> <b>terrace</b> began to form at ~ 1200 ka or after.

The {{basis of this}} reconstruction is a sedimentary stack comprising fluvial and colluvial slope deposits.

In addition, there is also ample evidence for landscape instability in between these phases causing local soil truncation and slope instability in an open grassland–shrub environment.
