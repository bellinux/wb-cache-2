5|$|Although the {{character}} went through several <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> as the series progressed, her most prominent appearance, introduced in Resident Evil (2002) (a {{remake of the}} original 1996 title), was based on Canadian actor Julia Voth. In the films, she is portrayed by English actor Sienna Guillory. Valentine is often cited {{as one of the}} most attractive protagonists in the medium and has been featured in various Resident Evil merchandise, including action figures and card games.|$|E

5|$|Lenalee {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{characters}} Hoshino created for the manga, most notably before the series' protagonist, Allen Walker. She originated in Hoshino's one shot, Zone, where she is depicted as a teenager who wants the Earl to revive her boyfriend. Hoshino's <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> across the D.Gray-man series led to arguments between Hoshino and her editor who argued how Lenalee's hairstyle should look.|$|E
5|$|The Panzer IV saw {{service in}} all combat theaters {{involving}} Germany {{and was the}} only German tank to remain in continuous production throughout the war. Upgrades and design modifications, intended to counter new threats, extended its service life. Generally, these involved increasing the Panzer IV's armor protection or upgrading its weapons, although during {{the last months of}} the war, with Germany's pressing need for rapid replacement of losses, <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> also included simplifications to speed up the manufacturing process.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of new D-class cruisers were canceled {{to make way for}} Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. The provisional names of the planned D-class cruisers, Ersatz Elsass and Ersatz Hessen, were reallocated to the new ships, the contracts for which were awarded to the Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven and the Deutsche Werke in Kiel. Construction was held up by 14months, partly because Hitler wanted to secure the treaty with Britain before work began, and partly due to numerous <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> after the ships had been ordered.|$|E
5|$|Art {{director}} Jeremy Cook {{stated that}} maintaining readability and {{clarity of the}} units and combat space was highest priority of the game's art direction. He also {{wanted to make sure}} that the visual style remained consistent with the Halo universe, by ensuring that the recognisable traits of the units and structures were preserved. The Banished's art style was designed to contrast visually with the UNSC. Cook wanted the Banished to be reminiscent of the Covenant, but with a greater emphasis on the aesthetic of the Brute species. Brute vehicles and weapons featured in past Halo games helped influence the <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> and creation of new technology in the Banished's arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Baker, de Francisci, and Moore met in Washington on December 15. At that time, Baker, who {{hoped to}} start Peace dollar {{production}} in 1921, outlined the tight schedule {{for this to}} be accomplished, and requested certain <b>design</b> <b>changes.</b> Among these was the inclusion of the broken sword from the sculptor's alternate reverse design, to be placed under the eagle, on the mountaintop on which it stands, in addition to the olive branch. Baker approved the designs, subject to these changes. The revised designs were presented to President Harding on December 19. Harding insisted on the removal of a small feature of Liberty's face, which seemed to him to suggest a dimple, something he did not consider suggestive of peace, and the sculptor then did so.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began on}} May 5, 1931, under Brother Theophorus Kleemann, SVD, who became ill and died on September 12, 1931; Arthur Bialucha, a German {{architect}} living in Qingdao {{who had already}} completed several projects for the SVD, took over as construction superintendent. Construction was frustrated in 1933, when Adolf Hitler {{came to power in}} Germany and prohibited the transfer of money overseas. The diocese independently shouldered the cost of finishing the cathedral. This required a number of <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> to reduce costs. The changes are evident in drawings published before completion of construction, which show the roofs of the towers as bell-shaped. However, the roofs of the completed structure were changed to spires. Construction was finished in 1934, and the cathedral was consecrated on October 28 that year.|$|E
5|$|During the Classical and Romantic {{periods of}} music, lasting from roughly 1750 to 1900, {{a great deal}} of musical {{instruments}} capable of producing new timbres and higher volume were developed and introduced into popular music. The <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> that broadened the quality of timbres allowed instruments to produce a wider variety of expression. Large orchestras rose in popularity and, in parallel, the composers determined to produce entire orchestral scores that made use of the expressive abilities of modern instruments. Since instruments were involved in collaborations of a much larger scale, their designs had to evolve to accommodate the demands of the orchestra.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for {{only a small number}} of <b>design</b> <b>changes,</b> mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the leading edge of the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In a {{collaborative}} design and manufacturing system, the {{different parts of}} a product can be designed by different design teams at different plants. In addition, the parts can be distributed and manufactured with manufacturing operation at different plants. The design assignment and manufacturing distribution affect {{the cost of the}} product. The purpose of a <b>design</b> <b>change</b> is to modify a portion of a product for certain improvement purposes such as adding values or reducing costs. A <b>design</b> <b>change</b> may cause changes of the related design tasks and manufacturing operations that are distributed at different plants. In this research, a <b>design</b> <b>change</b> evaluated model is presented to evaluate the affected design task assignment and the changed manufacturing operation distribution. A mathematical programming model is presented for design task assignment and manufacturing operation distribution with an objective of minimizing the total design and manufacturing cost. The design related costs include design operational cost and design communication cost. The manufacturing related costs include manufacturing operation cost and setup and handling cost. With the presented model, the total costs before and after a <b>design</b> <b>change</b> can be evaluated. The changed total cost is compared with the gained value to determine the worth value of a <b>design</b> <b>change.</b> Implementation and tes...|$|R
5|$|Following several <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> to the Ares I and Ares V rockets, the RS-25 {{was to be}} {{replaced}} with a single J-2X engine for the Ares I second stage and six modified RS-68 engines (which was based on both the SSME and Apollo-era J-2 engine) on the Ares V core stage; {{this meant that the}} RS-25 would be retired along with the space shuttle fleet. In 2010, however, NASA was directed to halt the Constellation program, and with it development of the Ares I and Ares V, instead focusing on building a new heavy lift launcher.|$|E
5|$|Hōshōs keel {{was laid}} down by the Asano Shipbuilding Company in Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, on 16 December 1920. She was {{launched}} on 13 November 1921 and towed to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal for completion on 10 January 1922. Hōshō was delayed by repeated <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> and late deliveries of equipment, pushing the commissioning date from March to 27 December 1922. She was commissioned lacking much of her aviation equipment, and did not begin landing trials until 22 February 1923. The first landings were made by British pilots under contract, who were quickly replaced by Japanese pilots trained by the British Aviation Mission.|$|E
5|$|Initially ordered as Panzerschiffe, {{the three}} Deutschland-class ships were {{designed}} to meet the limitations imposed on the German Navy by the Treaty of Versailles. The treaty limited large German warships to a displacement of , but did not restrict the caliber of main battery guns. Several innovations were incorporated into the design, including extensive use of welding and all-diesel propulsion, which saved weight and allowed for the heavier main armament and armor. Nevertheless, the ships exceeded the weight restriction by several thousand tons, though the German Navy claimed the vessels were within the limitations. The three ships, Deutschland, Admiral Scheer, and Admiral Graf Spee, were built between 1929 and 1936. <b>Design</b> <b>changes</b> were made {{over the course of the}} construction program, resulting in slightly differing characteristics of each ship.|$|E

5|$|Sea {{trials and}} {{modifications}} {{lasted more than}} a year, and once she entered active service in October 1899, the ship became the flagship of Prince Heinrich in the I Squadron of the German Heimatflotte (Home Fleet). The I Squadron was primarily occupied with training exercises throughout each year, and also made numerous trips to other European countries, particularly Great Britain and Sweden–Norway. In 1901, the ship was severely damaged after striking submerged rocks in the Baltic; the incident contributed to <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> in later German battleships {{to make them more}} resistant to underwater damage.|$|E
5|$|Some {{observers}} consider Millennium Park {{to be the}} city's {{most important}} project since the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. It far exceeded its originally proposed budget of $150million. The final cost of $475million was borne by Chicago taxpayers and private donors. The city paid $270million; private donors paid the rest, and assumed roughly half of the financial responsibility for the cost overruns. The construction delays and cost overruns were attributed to poor planning, many <b>design</b> <b>changes,</b> and cronyism. Many critics have praised the completed park.|$|E
5|$|The Command and Service Modules were mated in the KSC {{altitude}} chamber in September, and combined system testing was performed. Altitude testing was performed first unmanned, then {{with both the}} prime and backup crews, from October 10 through December 30. During this testing, the Environmental Control Unit in the Command Module {{was found to have}} a design flaw, and was sent back to the manufacturer for <b>design</b> <b>changes</b> and rework. The returned ECU then leaked water/glycol coolant, and had to be returned a second time. Also during this time, a propellant tank in Service Module 017 had ruptured during testing at NAA, prompting the separation of the modules and removal from the chamber so the Service Module could be tested for signs of the tank problem. These tests were negative.|$|E
