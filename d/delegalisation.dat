40|$|Extract] Attempts {{have long}} been made to {{introduce}} degrees of informalism into youth justice systems. Such initiatives were especially evident throughout the decades of the 1970 s and 1980 s. During this period, many youth justice researchers, policy analysts and practitioners - particularly across North America, Europe and Australia - advocated radical alternatives to, or departures from, formal justice. Diversion, decriminalisation, decarceration, deprofessionalisation, decentralisation, <b>delegalisation</b> and, ultimately, decarceration, formed the conceptual foundations for a movement towards less criminalising, more child-centred and more human-rights compliant responses to children {{in conflict with the}} law. Such movement was embedded, more generally, within a 'destructuring impulse' relating to 'all parts of the machine' which challenged orthodox 'justice' and the concomitant hegemony of state, bureaucratic and professional power (Cohen, 1985 : 36) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{discussion}} paper examines the institutionalization process of a non-regular employment form especially {{focusing on the}} establishment of the temporary dispatching work (haken) system. The institutionalization process of the haken system can be divided into three periods: <b>delegalisation</b> (1947 - 86), legalisation (1986 - 99), and diffusion (1999 -). Declining labor strength, the emergence of deregulation bodies, and the changing attitude of the Ministry of Labor (MHLW) characterize the legal developments. Together with the liberalization of private job placement and the expansion of fixed-term contract work, temporary work became an important sources of flexible and skilled labor, and expanded more rapidly than other employment forms in the late 90 s. In this development, temporary help firms started to reframe their business as "personnel services, " and have positioned themselves to replace the traditional firm-internal supply of mobile employees such as shukkô and tenseki with external dispatched employees of temporary help firms.

40|$|The EU’s {{sporting}} competence {{derives from}} the legal norm, established by the European Court of Jus- tice, that requires that ‘sporting rules’ of sports governing bodies which have an economic impact and which breach the fundamental freedoms or competition law can only be justified if {{shown to be a}} proportionate response to an inherent need in the sport. However, the certainty of this norm is undermined by the EU’s subsequent Treaty com- petence for sport, a political compromise, which is ambiguous, and which in due course generated the Euro- pean Commission’s sports policy, with its emphasis on governance and social dialogue. Consequently, EU sports law has evolved into ‘soft law’ which is far from coherent. This is demonstrated in the tolerance shown for certain of UEFA’s ‘sporting rules’, notably its Financial Fair Play Regulations, which restrict competition and lack propor- tionality yet have not attracted sanction from the European Commission (a sports law policy which could be charac- terised as not even constituting soft law but <b>delegalisation)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Well-preserved {{copies of}} {{religious}} polemics {{from the period}} of the 16 th and the 17 th century in library and museum collections usually constitute a rarity. Such writings were often purposefully destroyed by religious opponents; therefore, procuring them was not easy even in the past. One of the manners of copying such works which aroused powerful controversies was their manual rewriting. This also refers to the old prints from the period of disputes concerning the Union of Brest by the Bug River (1596). The collection of Cyrillic manuscripts of the National Library in Warsaw contains two books which feature copies of anti-Latin texts expressing dissatisfaction and protests of a well-known representative of the Orthodox Church – Kiev Monk Father Zachariasz Kopysteński, in relation to the conclusion of the religious union with the Roman Catholics and its formal and legal consequences of <b>delegalisation</b> of the Orthodox Church in the Republic of Poland. The article contains a codicological description of both manuscripts and their textual relations with printed books of polemics {{from the beginning of the}} 17 th century...|$|E
