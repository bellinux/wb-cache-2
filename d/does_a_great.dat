500|$|Manjusha Radhakrishnan of Gulf News {{rated the}} film 4 out of 5 stars; while she criticized the terrorists' lack of depth and weak points in Neerjas second half, she wrote that [...] "the {{climax of the}} film is {{powerful}} and makes up for that blip." [...] Jason Klein of Variety declared that DAR-Film Leaderboard was notably absent of Oscar-nominated films, but part of the gap was filled by Neerja. Sonali Kokra of The National praised the film: [...] "Neerja is a great story told well. Mitesh Mirchandani’s jerky camerawork <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> job of using the claustrophobic confines of the aircraft to showcase the oppressiveness of the situation and the terror of the hostages." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Chuck Versus the Intersect" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, with several praising the casting of the series, especially that of Zachary Levi. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode {{a rating of}} 9 out of 10, writing, [...] "Schwartz and Fedak's script for the Chuck pilot is very strong, deftly mixing action and humor. Where Schwartz's other new series, Gossip Girl, could use more of the humor he brought to The O.C., Chuck <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> job capturing the wit and self-awareness Schwartz's previous series contained." [...] Varun Lella of AOL TV criticized the episode's opening as being [...] "a weak gag", though writing that [...] "the ensuing moments were hilarious enough to almost erase the poorly executed opening moments." [...] Stephen Lackey of Mania called the pilot better than he expected, as well as [...] "energetic, cinematic, and quite funny." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode an A- {{on a scale of}} A+ to F.|$|E

500|$|GameFan {{praised the}} [...] "super stylish" [...] full motion video. Allgame felt {{the game to}} be worth playing for the FMV alone, calling it the [...] "best aspect of the game" [...] and [...] "an awesome video {{presentation}} that, combined {{with a number of}} high quality voice-acting jobs, <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> job of conferring the intensity and danger of the nuclear dilemma at hand." [...] Game Revolution noted the strong production values of most of the FMV and while a minority had [...] "back yard" [...] production, they nevertheless used quality actors and [...] "fairly impressed" [...] the reviewer, though he criticised the [...] "MTV-like editing". Edge also noted the [...] "MTV-style presentation" [...] and called it [...] "stylish" [...] and atmospheric. Reviewing Nuclear Strike 64, Allgame praised the atmospheric music as [...] "reminiscent of a large budget political spy thriller". The reviewer said: [...] "what really cranks up the adrenaline and ramps up the immersion factor in the game is the great sound effects." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews for {{the episode}} were positive. Chris Carabott of IGN gave [...] "Walkabout" [...] a 9.5/10, stating that [...] "Terry O'Quinn puts in an {{exceptional}} performance", and commenting that showing Locke, who [...] "seemed like a confident and resourceful {{man with a}} mysterious and intriguing past", to be a [...] "shell {{of a human being}} that is trying desperately to find his place in the world" [...] was [...] "a perfect juxtaposition of the differences between Locke off and on the island". He also praised the supporting stories, claiming that [...] "Matthew Fox <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> job of playing the uneasy leader" [...] as Jack Shephard and that the Shannon-Charlie storyline [...] "does supply a little comic relief". Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it described the revelation that Locke was a paraplegic as being [...] "one of the show's signature moments", and commented that the episode [...] "cemented the show as 'Must-See TV'" [...] and was [...] "a five-star effort." ...|$|E
500|$|William Leith of the London Evening Standard was {{impressed}} with the biography, and noted that [...] "the thing about Madonna is not in her sensationalism, it’s in the fact that how much humane she appeared in the book. Taraborrelli does a fine job of capturing the world's most famous courtesan, in the most infamous way", and John Smyntek from Knight Ridder thought [...] "Taraborrelli [...] retelling all [...] and more. After all, in those 10 years, the Great Woman has had two children, wed and maintained her image as a major pain in the keister. He <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> job of bringing forth these unknown facts." [...] Ward Triplet of the Kansas City Star felt that although the book is [...] "an eerie, but compelling day by day account of Madonna, and how she became who she is, sometimes Taraborrelli feels like revealing more about his process of writing than his subject", and Ann O' Neil in the Los Angeles Times complimented the book for being [...] "different" [...] from the [...] "regular dirt written everyday about Madonna." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Have You Seen This Snail?" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Tom Shales of The Washington Post called the episode deeply hilarious {{and described the}} plot as a [...] "bittersweet riot". He drew attention to how the story {{is similar to the}} plot of [...] "Dumped", an earlier episode in which Gary deserted SpongeBob. David Johnson of the DVD Verdict positively reacted to the DVD release of the episode and said [...] "I'm not sure what to say, here. Mr. Squarepants is so ridiculously popular, this disc will most definitely sell itself." [...] Aida Ekberg of Yahoo! Voices ranked Amy Poehler on her [...] "Top 10 SpongeBob SquarePants Guest Stars" [...] list and said [...] "I'm surprised more comedians haven't been guest stars on SpongeBob.

500|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by music critics. Miles Marshall Lewis of The Village Voice commented on its Prince influence, stating [...] "D's falsetto plays the [...] "Do Me Baby"-era chocolate-seduction Prince role", while Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters described the song as [...] "simply the best Prince song since his Diamonds and Pearls days". Neal cited [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] {{as the best}} track featured on Voodoo, and praised D'Angelo's style, stating [...] "arguably Prince has never sounded better channeled through D'Angelo." [...] On the song, Andy Peterson of The GW Hatchet wrote that [...] "D’Angelo <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> impression of old-school Prince, full of kinky keyboards, grinding guitars and not-so-subtle lyrics." [...] In citing {{it one of the}} Greatest Make-Out Songs of All Time, Blender magazine wrote that D'Angelo [...] "set the pace for bump 'n' grind in the Aughts. A high point for dippin' it low". Reveille Magazine's Steve McPherson called it [...] "the best Prince song Prince never wrote" [...] and cited the song's climb to its final chorus section as [...] "the finest musical approximation of sexual climax since Serge Gainsbourg's 'Je T'Aime, Moi Non Plus'".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics. Travis Fickett from IGN retroactively gave the episode an 8.0 out of 10, signifying a [...] "great" [...] episode. Fickett wrote that [...] "Hot Girl" [...] helped to establish {{what type of}} character Michael would eventually become in the subsequent seasons, noting the character's [...] "deep and desperate loneliness" [...] which would eventually become a main conceit in the series. He concluded that the episode ended with a [...] "classic Office moment"—Michael realizing that Jim will be giving Katy a ride home—that [...] "captures the desperation and loneliness of [...] – and <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> job of {{setting the stage for}} the show's terrific second season." [...] Miss Alli from Television Without Pity gave the episode a B but described it as [...] "the weakest of the first season." [...] Alli noted that the episode was largely the [...] "play on the same joke," [...] featuring Michael and Dwight [...] "making idiots of themselves over Katy." [...] However, she did positively compare the American version of the show to the British version, stating, [...] "All things considered, I think the first season is very underrated owing to unnecessary comparisons to the British version," [...] but concluded that the episode was [...] "its weak moment." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was parodied during the 2003 French & Sanders Christmas Special episode of American comedy show MADtv. [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] was sampled by Justice on their tracks [...] "D.A.N.C.E." [...] and [...] "Valentine", from their debut album † (2007). The music video was recreated on the 2010 American series Glee episode [...] "Britney/Brittany". The {{characters}} of Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) and Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) are put under general anesthesia {{during a trip}} to the dentist's office. They share an hallucination, in which Morris appears as Spears, whereas Rivera plays Madonna. Morris explained, [...] "The 'Me Against the Music' montage, it's literally copied exactly from the video, the shots and looks, but the choreography is made so much more for a dancer– none of it is from the video. [...] It's insane." [...] At the end of the number, Spears replaces Santana and pins Brittany against the wall, announcing to her that she is in a fantasy. Spears applauded the cover, pointing out that it [...] "looks just like the original," [...] and adding, [...] "Santana <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> Madonna impression." [...] The song charted at number ninety-three in Australia, fifty-four in Canada and fifty-six in the United States.|$|E
500|$|However, {{some critics}} {{felt that the}} album was overly ambitious and that the band's musical {{departure}} may alienate listeners. Chad Grischow of IGN felt that the album's dramatic hooks seem [...] "bloated" [...] at times: [...] "The band <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> of focusing on what they do best, but the album does drown itself a bit with all the overwhelming enormity of it all." [...] Scott Shetler of Slant disliked the [...] "melodramatic" [...] undertones of [...] "I've Got All This Ringing in My Ears and None on My Fingers" [...] and [...] "Golden", writing [...] "they don't handle that style quite as well as Panic! at the Disco". Cory Apar of AllMusic opined that the album's pop direction contradicts the band's lyrical claims of wishing to stick to their roots. He called the album's various styles [...] "hit and miss", yet commented that [...] "Once Infinity on High sinks in, it's indeed a fun record. But for a band that was once so self-assured and able to utilize its talents so compellingly, the album is regrettably haphazard." [...] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian believed that the album was overly sullen, but noted that [...] "They may not be happy, but they haven't forgotten to be catchy." [...] Barry Nicholson of NME found the amount of guest producers to be unnecessary and disliked some of the songs, but admired the album's [...] "infectious" [...] nature.|$|E
500|$|When Carey {{worked with}} Walden on [...] "I Don't Wanna Cry", {{they worked on}} several other songs. Together, they decided to [...] "slow down the tempo" [...] and create a [...] "crying type of ballad," [...] one which {{according}} to him, featured a direct inspiration from gospel genres. After they completed the song, Lawrence noted {{how much of a}} perfectionist Carey was. He said that after finishing the song, she returned to the studio the following week, all in order to correct [...] "one line" [...] that troubled her. As one of the four original songs she gave to Mottola, [...] "Someday" [...] became Wake's favorite from the start, [...] "I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one day and said 'I'd love to do it {{if you want to do}} it.' It was great, I'm glad she called me." [...] During its recording, Carey revealed how the song came into existence. She had been working on the demo with Margulies in his studio. As he began playing different notes on the electric keyboard, Carey directed him on the chord changes, while providing the chorus, lyrics and melody. In [...] "All in Your Mind", Carey <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> vocal performance, doing staccatos up to F7. According to the artist, her voice [...] "split" [...] while doing those ornaments. While she thought to remove it from the song's recording, Wake and Walden were very impressed by the vocal flips, claiming that it would fit in perfectly.|$|E
5000|$|Stephanie Flasher of TV After Dark {{gave the}} episode a B rating {{saying that the}} episode was very [...] "Denzo-centric". [...] "In summary, on Fire was an {{acceptable}} episode of the hit supernatural show.

500|$|Ideas {{alluding}} to romance are prevalent throughout the episode. The development between Shane Walsh and Lori Grimes continues in [...] "TS-19", which showcases a flashback featuring Shane being conflicted {{with the decision}} to leave an unconscious Rick Grimes in the hospital—who Shane initially presumes to be dead. Kirkman asserted that the sequence added dimension to the storyline, and concluded that by {{the ending of the}} episode, the audience will no longer identify Shane as an antagonist. [...] "Up until the sixth episode, you get the sense that Shane actually is a bad guy, that he lied to Lori and made her believe that he was dead in order to facilitate him moving in on her," [...] said Kirkman. [...] "The flashback <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> job of telling you that that's not true: He tried to save Rick, he wanted to save Rick. He was kind of up against the wall there and actually did believe that Rick was dead." [...] Lincoln said of the flashback: [...] "You realize Shane's loyalty as a friend and as a man—and also his weaknesses. He still can't make a decision without his partner, and you realize he's flawed—everybody is under incredible duress, you see the state of the world is so extreme and terrifying that people are making split-second decisions under great duress. Is Shane barricading Rick in, or is he trying to prevent him being taken by the walkers? There are many different ways to construe what Shane has done and that's the beauty of the show is that there's no clear and definite answers, you make your own mind." [...] Other themes prominent in the episode include suicide and terror.|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan Lewis of Allmusic felt {{it showed}} them [...] "as a talented young band, despite the flimsy songwriting {{and the lack}} of light and shade on the album". While Greg Lawrence at WHAMMO.com.au noted that it {{provides}} [...] "a mature, complete range – from the early-penned punk mayhem of 'Blame' to the delicacy of the 'Twilight=Dusk', from the dark tones of 'Jerks of Attention' to the bright strains of radio hit 'Leaving Home'.

During a 2009 interview Dobson said, [...] "I wrote a song, she dug it, and she sang it. But I didn't want it for my record. It just wasn't right for me, and I just {{felt like it was}} better for someone else, and she <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> job on it. I was really impressed. She sounded great.

2500|$|In {{his review}} for Time, Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "A {{peerless}} ensemble of actors fills Glengarry Glen Ross with audible glares and shudders. The play was zippy black comedy about predators in twilight; {{the film is}} a photo-essay, shot in morgue closeup, about the difficulty most people have convincing themselves that what they do matters". However, Desson Howe's review in The Washington Post criticized Foley's direction, writing that it [...] "doesn't add {{much more than the}} street between. If his intention is {{to create a sense of}} claustrophobia, he also creates the (presumably) unwanted effect of a soundstage. There is no evidence of life outside the immediate world of the movie". Movie Room Reviews gave the film 4 stars and said [...] "Director James Foley <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> job of making the film seem claustrophobic, so that the audience almost feels as if it is in the fluorescent lighting of the drab office." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the film, {{the hotel}} {{possibly}} derives its malevolent energy from being built on an Indian burial ground. In the novel, {{the reason for}} the hotel's manifestation of evil is possibly explained by a theme present in King's previous novel Salem's Lot as well as Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House: a physical place may absorb the evils that transpire there and manifest them as a vaguely sentient malevolence. The film's Hallorann speaks to Danny about that phenomenon occurring at the Overlook. In the novel, Jack <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of investigation of the hotel's past through a scrapbook, a subplot almost omitted from the film aside from two touches: a brief appearance of the scrapbook beside the typewriter, and Jack's statement to the ghost of Grady that he knows his face from an old newspaper article describing the latter's horrific acts. [...] Kubrick in fact shot a scene where Jack discovers the scrapbook but removed it during post-production, a decision which co-screenwriter Diane Johnson lamented.|$|E
