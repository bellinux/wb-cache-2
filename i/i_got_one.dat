500|$|Daavettila {{graduated}} from Michigan Tech in 2008 and tried {{out for the}} Flint Generals of the International Hockey League (IHL). He appeared in two games for the Generals {{at the end of}} the season (for only about three shifts), and did not register a point. Daavettila had not originally planned to pursue a professional hockey career, but said [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> skate with Flint, it kind of sparked my interest and I decided to give it a try". During the off-season, Daavettila worked for a structural engineering firm in Saginaw, Michigan. He used vacation time at the start of the next hockey season later in 2008 to try out for the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Muskegon Lumberjacks (IHL), though he was rejected by both teams. Tryouts with two more IHL teams, the Kalamazoo Wings and the Bloomington PrairieThunder, did not result in a contract either. Daavettila assumed his hockey career was over and went back to his engineering job, but he continued to skate a couple times a week. He had left an impression on Kalamazoo coach Nick Bootland, however, who called Daavettila back in March 2009 after his team was depleted by injuries. [...] "You could see he had a skill set," [...] said Bootland. [...] "But I thought the way he held on to the puck, he was going to get himself killed. ... You kept thinking he was going to make a mistake. Then he'd pop a guy for a breakaway." ...|$|E

2500|$|Van Brocklin, a heavy {{cigarette}} smoker, {{suffered a}} number of illnesses, including a brain tumor. [...] After it was removed, he told the press, [...] "It was a brain transplant. They gave me a sportswriter's brain, to make sure <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> that hadn't been used."

A couple of weeks ago I was doing some writing for Rihanna". In September 2012, Ne-Yo confirmed his involvement the album saying [...] "I did go in the studio with her, I know <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> or two on the album that she's definitely keeping." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, as {{you admire}} pretenders, George, I {{wish you were}} in my shoes this morning, for <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>one</b> of the most disagreeable {{interviews}} on hand which ever fell to my lot." ...|$|R

60|$|HARRY. I wasn't expecting it. I {{went down}} like a ninepin. I was up again in a flash and just threw myself at the blighters. You should have seen 'em scatter. Luckily <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> of them.|$|E
60|$|A {{crash of}} brush {{interrupted}} me. Thump of hoofs, crack of branches--then a big buck deer bounded onward into the thicket. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> snap shot at his fleeting blurred image and missed him. We ran ahead, {{but to no}} avail.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR COLVIN,--I am at my wits' end {{about this}} abominable form of admission. I don't {{know what the}} devil it is; <b>I</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>one</b> even if <b>I</b> did, and so can't sign.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't," [...] he said, [...] "swear either way, whether Luke had {{his stick}} with him last night or not. I know that stick, of course. <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>one</b> very like it myself." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Weston. [...] "It was winter, {{and we had}} {{rather a}} rough time in the ranges. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> foot frost-bitten, and was lame for some while afterward. It was the one I cut, which {{probably}} made it more susceptible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know {{something}} about that," [...] said Whopper. [...] "I once took a beautiful picture---at least, I thought it was beautiful---of a flock of sheep, and when I tried to develop the plate in a hurry <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> end light-struck, so it was no good." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Now,' says I to Solly, {{with a wink}} at myself, 'here's {{the first}} dinner-station we've struck where {{we can get a}} real good plate of beans.'

60|$|A fright <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> night, however, kept me indoors for {{the better}} part of a week. In my going out the little house door had been {{carelessly}} left unlatched. Algol and the red planet Mars had been my quarry among the floating woolpack clouds. The wind was lightly blowing from the north-west after the calm. I drew down my veil and set off briskly and lightheartedly for home.|$|E

60|$|As it was, {{we were in}} {{no small}} danger. Zip! A tiny pebble whirred past with the force almost of a bullet. Lop-Ear and I began {{paddling}} frantically. Whiz-zip-bang! Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish. The pebble had struck him between the shoulders. Then <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> and yelled. The only thing that saved us was the exhausting of Red-Eye's ammunition. He dashed back to the gravel-bed for more, while Lop-Ear and I paddled away.|$|E
