25|$|Clara Barton {{became an}} {{educator}} in 1838 for 12 years in schools in Canada and West Georgia. Barton fared {{well as a}} teacher and knew how to handle rambunctious children, particularly the boys, since as a child she enjoyed her male cousins' and brothers' company. She learned how to act like them, making it easier for her to relate to and control the boys in her classroom since they respected her. After her mother's death in 1851, the family home closed down. Barton decided to further her education by pursuing writing and languages at the Clinton Liberal Institute in New York. In this college town, she developed many friendships that broadened <b>her</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> on many issues concurring at the time. The principal of the institute recognized her tremendous abilities and admired her work. This friendship lasted for many years, eventually turning into a romance. As a writer, her terminology was pristine and easy to understand. Her writings and bodies of work could instruct the local statesmen. No one could exceed her outstanding service to humanity in war and in peace.|$|E

500|$|Scenes were filmed {{primarily}} in Portland, Oregon. Stunt {{work was done}} mainly by the cast. The fight sequence between Gigandet and Pattinson's characters in a ballet studio, which was filmed {{during the first week}} of production, involved a substantial amount of wire work because the vampires in the story have superhuman strength and speed. Gigandet incorporated mixed martial arts fighting moves in this sequence, which involved chicken and honey as substitutes for flesh. Bella, the protagonist, is unconscious during these events, and since the novel is told from <b>her</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> such action sequences are illustrative and unique to the film. Pattinson noted that maintaining one's center of gravity is difficult when doing wire work [...] "because you have to really fight against it as well as letting it do what it needs to do." [...] Lefèvre found the experience disorienting since forward motion was out of her control.|$|E
500|$|Rosenberg {{developed}} an outline {{by the end}} of August, and collaborated with Hardwicke on writing the screenplay during the following month. Rosenberg said Hardwicke [...] "was a great sounding board and had all sorts of brilliant ideas.... I'd finish off scenes and send them to her, and get back her notes." [...] Due to the impending Writers Guild of America strike, Rosenberg worked full-time to finish the screenplay before October 31. In adapting the novel, she [...] "had to condense a great deal." [...] Some characters from the novel were not featured in the screenplay, whereas some characters were combined into others. [...] "ur intent all along was to stay true to the book", Rosenberg explained, [...] "and it has to do less with adapting it word for word and more with making sure the characters' arcs and emotional journeys are the same." [...] Hardwicke suggested the use of voice over to convey Bella's internal dialogue — since the novel is told from <b>her</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> — and she sketched some of the storyboards during pre-production.|$|E
40|$|Tools, {{approaches}} {{and methods of}} leadership development are plentiful, and form a set of techniques that have evolved over time.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Blow" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Marrs Piliero. The video was released on February 25, 2011. Kesha wanted the video to be [...] "different, a video that was cool and random". The director, Piliero, {{came up with the}} idea for the video's mythological aspect saying, [...] "I had this idea running in my head with just the idea of unicorns, If I massacred unicorns, they could bleed rainbows. I'm a fan of violence and I'm always trying to find a way to make it OK." [...] While being interviewed Piliero spoke of the collaboration with Kesha, explaining <b>her</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> on the video, [...] "Before we started filming, we had quite a few talks. She was adamant you can't back away from the crazy; everything about the idea she loved and she enforced the fact that she wanted to embrace every aspect of it and really go for it, On set, she was having fun. She was like, 'I want to lick a unicorn.' It was rad working with her because there definitely wasn't a sense of her feeling awkward about stuff or detached; no ego. It felt like we had worked together before." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{the draft}} {{followed}} Maguire's idea of retelling {{the story of}} the 1939 film from the perspective of its main villain, the storyline of the stage adaptation [...] "goes far afield" [...] from the novel. As Holzman observed in an interview with Playbill, [...] "It was [...] brilliant idea to take this hated figure and tell things from <b>her</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> and to have the two witches be roommates in college, but the way in which their friendship develops– and really the whole plot– is different onstage." [...] Schwartz justified [...] the deviation, saying [...] "Primarily we were interested in the relationship between Galinda– who becomes Glinda– and Elphaba...the friendship of these two women and how their characters lead them to completely different destinies." [...] In addition to this change in focus, other major plot modifications include Fiyero's appearance as the scarecrow, Elphaba's survival at the end, Nessarose using a wheelchair instead of being born without arms, Boq having a continuing love interest for Glinda - and eventually becoming the Tin Woodman instead of Nick Chopper, the complete cutting of Elphaba's years in the Vinkus, the deletion of Liir's birth, Fiyero not having a wife and children, and Doctor Dillamond not being murdered.|$|E
