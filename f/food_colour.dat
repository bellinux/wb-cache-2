60|$|Seedlings {{from the}} same fruit, and the young of the same litter, {{sometimes}} differ considerably from each other, though both {{the young and the}} parents, as Muller has remarked, have apparently been exposed to exactly the same conditions of life; and this shows how unimportant the direct effects of the conditions of life are in comparison with the laws of reproduction, and of growth, and of inheritance; for had the action of the conditions been direct, if any of the young had varied, all would probably have varied in the same manner. To judge how much, in the case of any variation, we should attribute to the direct action of heat, moisture, light, food, etc., is most difficult: my impression is, that with animals such agencies have produced very little direct effect, though apparently more in the case of plants. Under this point of view, Mr. Buckman's recent experiments on plants seem extremely valuable. When all or nearly all the individuals exposed to certain conditions are affected in the same way, the change at first appears to be directly due to such conditions; but in some cases it can be shown that quite opposite conditions produce similar changes of structure. Nevertheless some slight amount of change may, I think, be attributed to the direct action of the conditions of life--as, in some cases, increased size from amount of <b>food,</b> <b>colour</b> from particular kinds of food and from light, and perhaps the thickness of fur from climate.|$|E

50|$|In general, {{all parts}} of the H. rhamnoides contain several {{bioactive}} compounds that can have positive health effects for humans as well as livestock. Particularly the fruit contain high vitamin C amounts, which exceed the ones of lemons and oranges.The H. rhamnoides fruits are processed in the food industry to different products. Usually, the berries are first washed and then pressed, resulting in press-cake and juice. The fruit press cake can be used to gain oil, natural <b>food</b> <b>colour</b> pigments (yellow/orange) or jam while the juice is further processed and then packaged as final juice product. Even in countries where there is no H. rhamnoides production, at least a few products can be found. It is usually possible to buy H. rhamnoides jam or fruit concentrate, fruit juices and some cosmetics, such as hand cream, shampoo or massage oils. In southern France for example, H. rhamnoides is commonly sold as fruit juice or as an ingredient in non-alcoholic and alcoholic mixed beverages. Typical liquor produced at the same latitudes in Italy, Tuscany, is the officinal Tuscan liquor - Spinello.|$|E
50|$|The {{series was}} filmed {{in the former}} Alexander McKay School on Russell Street in Halifax's North End, which Doherty (the Harbourmaster) had {{attended}} as a child. At the peak of production, the show employed forty people. The characters, including Theodore, were designed and built by Fred Allen, a Halifax artist and set designer who strove to balance expressive human faces with realistic and weathered industrial details. Allen and three model assistants built the models in a workshop adjacent to the large set located in a water-filled gymnasium. The radio controlled models were driven by propellers and used underwater wheels to provide guidance and avoid drifting out of shots. Blue <b>food</b> <b>colour</b> was used to give an ocean look to the water. While Allen built the vessel models, the background set, inspired by the cityscape of Halifax and Dartmouth buildings, was built by the art department at CBC Halifax. Many of the original models used to film the series can now be seen at Halifax's Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, while a few others were sold on eBay in 2010.|$|E
40|$|Hyperactive is {{one part}} of the attention-deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD). Several factors as diet, especially artificial <b>food</b> <b>colours,</b> are assumed to contribute to hyperactive behaviour in children since the early 70 ´s and are still being discussed. Artificial <b>food</b> <b>colours</b> are used to create the bright colours in sweets, lemonade and ice cream as well as cosmetics and drugs. Their effects on human health are verified by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) – nevertheless artificial <b>food</b> <b>colours,</b> especially Azo-dyes are under suspicion to promote hyperactive behaviour. The following report focuses particular on children as the target group. The aim of this HTA is to find evidence whether there is a correlation between Azo-dyes and hyperactivity in children. The search included 4 Databases. Using inclusion criteria, two systematic reviews and eleven controlled trials could be identified, respectively. The majority of the studies suggested a correlation between artificial <b>food</b> <b>colours</b> and increased hyperactivity in children. However, the design and methods varied extremely between studies, which complicates the comparison and drawn conclusions. The hypothesis of a correlation can neither be affirmed nor be abolished. Methodological problems such as the inappropriateness of study designs and applied methods need to be tackled. Further research is needed...|$|R
