500|$|This episode {{introduces}} the character Michonne, a protagonist in the comic {{series of the}} same name who is portrayed by Danai Gurira. Gurira was cast as part of the series a week before the broadcasting of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] although rumors of introducing Michonne circulated months prior to the season finale. Kirkman admitted that he was a fan of her work in the HBO drama series Treme. Rutina Wesley, who played Tara Thornton in True Blood, was rumored to be considered for the role of Michonne, although Kirkman stated that she was never involved in the auditioning process. [...] "It was a lot of actresses. The True Blood actress, I don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> even available; I think she's still on True Blood. I don't know where that rumor came from, but to my knowledge, she was never involved." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter finally {{agrees to}} {{investigate}} the Ryans, quickly being informed by Diana Berrigan (Marsha Thomason) that Ben has an armed robbery conviction. [...] As Peter phones Elizabeth to let her <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> correct, Ben visits the Burke home and vaguely threatens Elizabeth. [...] Clinton Jones (Sharif Atkins) follows Ben and discovers the identity of Ben’s partner: Connor Bailey (Will Chase). [...] In order {{to get closer to}} the suspects, Neal visits Ben’s parole office under the alias Nick Halden. [...] Using information gathered by Neal, Peter quickly realizes that the target of the heist is a luxury hotel. [...] Peter and Neal hurry to the hotel, barely missing Ben and Connor. [...] At the Burke home, Elizabeth and Mozzie follow Rebecca as she leaves the house. [...] Realizing that Peter will not reach them in time, Elizabeth approaches the Ryans as an FBI agent. [...] Her attempt fails just as Peter and the FBI arrive.|$|E
500|$|Georges-Claude Guilbert, {{author of}} Madonna as Postmodern Myth, {{compared}} her {{look in the}} video as a [...] "combination of Marilyn Monroe, Jean Seberg and Kim Novak." [...] He added {{that it was hard}} for him to believe that [...] " [...] did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> going to cause a huge controversy with the video... With such a song and video, she was throwing in America's face the image of a country ravaged by the abortion debate, which is far from being resolved." [...] Lynda Hart, {{one of the authors of}} Acting Out: Feminist Performances, felt that the video [...] "alternated between two competing representations of Madonna... Charging coercion, both sides make the video as an invitation to a certain way of life, in the process denying it the stylistic invocation of a rhetoric of self-authorization." [...] At the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards, the [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] video won the Best Female Video award, and was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Overall Performance.|$|E
60|$|Every {{time that}} Pupkin watched Zena praying in church, he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{too good for}} him. Every time that he came to call for her and found her reading Browning and Omar Khayyam he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> too clever for him. And every time that he saw her at all he {{realized}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> too beautiful for him.|$|R
60|$|She hesitated, but his gesture <b>was</b> sufficient. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> understood.|$|R
5000|$|She travels back up halls N and S to her {{starting}} point and <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> done.|$|R
500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} years of his reign, Edward IV's {{governance}} of England was dependent upon a small circle of supporters, most notably his cousin, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick. At around the time of Edward IV's secret marriage, Warwick was negotiating an alliance with France in an effort to thwart a similar arrangement being made by his sworn enemy Margaret of Anjou, wife of the deposed Henry VI. The plan was that Edward IV should marry a French princess. When his marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, who was both a commoner and from a family of Lancastrian supporters, became public, Warwick was both embarrassed and offended, and his relationship with Edward IV never recovered. The match was also badly received by the Privy Council, who according to Jean de Waurin told Edward with great frankness that [...] "he must <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> no wife for a prince such as himself".|$|E
60|$|When Clayton {{asked him}} about the girl he seemed {{surprised}} to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not there.|$|E
60|$|Presently I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{standing}} at my side. I felt her hand laid upon my shoulder.|$|R
60|$|There {{was no way}} of {{avoiding}} a reply, without arousing her suspicions; Herbert <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> keen-witted and persistent.|$|R
60|$|A note of weariness {{crept into}} her voice. I might have <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{near the end}} of her strength.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why not?' Agnes answered. 'I {{know nothing}} against her. On the only {{occasion}} when we met, {{she appeared to}} be a singularly timid, nervous person, looking dreadfully ill; and being indeed so ill that she fainted under the heat of my room. Why should we not do her justice? We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> innocent of any intention to wrong me; we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not aware of my engagement--' ...|$|E
60|$|THIRD PAGE. Fie on her dropsy, so {{she have}} a dropsy! I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> ever sweet to me.|$|E
60|$|He flushed again, for {{he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{aware of}} that incident. He remembered it himself with horror and shame.|$|E
60|$|But for {{the moment}} <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> powerless, carried along like a chip {{on the crest of}} his passion.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I've {{heard nothing}} from her since that letter. I do not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> in England, but I suppose <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> with them.' ...|$|R
60|$|He was {{learning}} to understand her, for though she showed no marked sign of displeasure he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not gratified.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> But {{the chances}} of happiness, of goodness, would be greater with a less self-centred person--for you." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{the crowd}} cheered lustily and Dorothy hugged the kitten {{in her arms}} and told her how delighted she was to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> innocent.|$|E
60|$|He {{had lived}} long enough to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> making herself believe what she said, and that she had not {{lived long enough}} to know this.|$|E
6000|$|Even Michael, already half asleep, <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> perturbed, and he asked, 'Can {{anything}} harm us, mother, {{after the}} night-lights are lit?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Upon my word, ma’am, I {{have never}} inquired,’ cried I; ‘I only <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a heartfelt Christian, {{and that is}} enough.’ ...|$|R
60|$|As in a dream, he {{had always}} seen her sweet face hanging over him, and dimly <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> ministering to him.|$|R
60|$|And Chalciope {{was there}} and Argus, trembling, and Medeia, wrapped closely in her veil; but Aietes did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> muttering cunning spells between her lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Duchess," [...] he repeated. [...] "I did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> coming here. She {{was kind}} enough to ask me to go to Scotland later on." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Hayward did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> bestowing {{the cup of}} cold water, as well {{as being}} {{literally}} ready to wash the feet of the poor disciple.|$|E
60|$|Francis <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{referring}} to the ten thousand pounds paid by the insurance offices. 'All those thousands gone already!' he exclaimed.|$|R
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> fond of drama, {{drinking}} and rugby, {{in which she}} has played as a flanker for a women's team.|$|R
6000|$|Even Michael, already half asleep, <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> perturbed, and he asked, [...] "Can {{anything}} harm us, mother, {{after the}} night-lights are lit?" ...|$|R
60|$|Until now we {{have only}} known Mildred Travers, as she called herself, in a casual way. We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{considered}} a competent nurse and had proved her capability {{in the care of}} baby Jane. Also we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> silent and reserved and that her eyes bore an habitual expression that was hard and repellent. Without being able to find any especial fault with the girl, no one was attracted toward her—always excepting the baby, who could not be expected to show discrimination at her tender age.|$|E
6000|$|... "No wonder," [...] Desmond said. [...] "It {{must have}} been terrible, indeed, to lose her lover, and to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> again {{in the power of}} that villain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody told me so. Why couldn't {{you let me}} <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> flighty beforehand? I {{thought that}} she was a person whom it would have done to marry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, then, {{on to the}} drawing-room sofa,' said Maude. 'I {{could have}} my supper, if I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> safe upon the sofa.' ...|$|R
60|$|Barney {{thought of}} the girl he loved; {{but he did not}} mention her name, for he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not for him now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Neither do I. I only <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> incomparably beautiful, and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has waked me up amazingly. Besides, {{she asked}} me to come." ...|$|R
