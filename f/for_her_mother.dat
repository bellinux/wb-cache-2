However, her family responsibilities further increased in January 1937 when her older sister died, leaving Carson as the sole breadwinner <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> and two nieces.|$|E
5|$|Coolbrith {{had hoped}} to tour the East Coast and Europe with Miller, but stayed behind in San Francisco because she felt obliged to care <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> and her seriously ill, widowed sister Agnes who was unable to care for herself or for her two children.

5|$|Brodie was {{a native}} of Chicago, the son of Latvian Jewish {{immigrants}} who was alienated from both his family and his family's religion. A bright, emotional graduate student in international relations, Brodie eventually became a noted expert in military strategy during the Cold War era. The McKays were horrified at their daughter's impending marriage; Dilworth Jensen felt betrayed. David O. McKay went to Chicago to warn his niece of the family's strong objections. Out of consideration <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> Fawn scheduled the wedding in an LDS chapel, but of the McKays, only Fawn's mother attended. None of Brodie's family did.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 Lee {{released}} the 22-minute short Subrosa, following a woman's search <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> in Seoul. Intended as a prequel for an undeveloped film entitled Priceless, {{the film was}} shot in several formats with a fifteen-person crew, hurriedly recording scenes in public locations. It extensively used character-centred shots, leading to what Lee described as an organic understanding of the character. It also featured on-screen sexual intercourse, framed in a medium shot, which Lee intended as a sign and not simply a sex scene. Although Priceless, meant as a sequel to Subrosa, went through more than thirty drafts, it was ultimately cancelled despite interest from Alliance Atlantis and Citytv.|$|E

5|$|In a {{flashback}} {{of the television}} series Supergirl, Lionel (portrayed by Ian Butcher) is portrayed to be benign; however, his family become dysfunctional after Lex's birth due to his wife Lillian (Brenda Strong), who gradually reveals herself being ruthless and narcissistic; these traits also later pass on to Lex which leads him to become Superman's archenemy and tarnishes his family name in the process. Lionel begins an extramarital affair {{that would lead to}} Lena Luthor's (Katie McGrath) conception, but remains with his family {{for the sake of his}} son.

5|$|It {{has been}} said of Hannah de Rothschild that she {{grew up with a}} good sense and {{presence}} of mind, enabling her to deputise <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> on grand social occasions at Mentmore and in London. This gave her confidence and the experience to be the perfect political wife. Marriage to her altered Rosebery's status, too: while his wife acquired Christian respectability and a title, Rosebery moved from being one of many wealthy and capable young noblemen to being one with unfathomable riches. This, coupled with his good looks, appealed to the public's imagination and gave him glamour.|$|E

5|$|Although Clement {{spent only}} six years {{serving as an}} umpire on a regular basis, she {{continued}} to serve intermittently until her forties. Following her time as a regularly serving umpire, Amanda Clement spent several years teaching physical education at the University of Wyoming, the Jamestown, North Dakota high school, and other schools in North Dakota and South Dakota. Clement also managed several Y.W.C.A.s, including one in LaCrosse, Wisconsin. Clement also served as the coach of Hudson Independent basketball team, organized tennis tournaments, {{and served as a}} newspaper reporter, police matron, typesetter, justice of the peace, and as the city assessor for the town of Hudson. In 1929 Clement moved back to South Dakota to care <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> who was ill.

5|$|Cornelis Suijk—a former {{director}} of the Anne Frank Foundation and president of the U.S. Center for Holocaust Education Foundation—announced in 1999 {{that he was in the}} possession of five pages that had been removed by Otto Frank from the diary prior to publication; Suijk claimed that Otto Frank gave these pages to him shortly before his death in 1980. The missing diary entries contain critical remarks by Anne Frank about her parents' strained marriage and discuss Frank's lack of affection <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother.</b> Some controversy ensued when Suijk claimed publishing rights over the five pages; he intended to sell them to raise money for his foundation. The Netherlands Institute for War Documentation, the formal owner of the manuscript, demanded the pages be handed over. In 2000 the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science agreed to donate US$300,000 to Suijk's foundation, and the pages were returned in 2001. Since then, they have been included in new editions of the diary.|$|E

5|$|In Scotland, {{the power}} of the Protestant Lords of the Congregation was rising at the expense of Mary's mother, who {{maintained}} effective control only through the use of French troops. The Protestant Lords invited English troops into Scotland in an attempt to secure Protestantism, and a Huguenot rising in France, called the Tumult of Amboise, in March 1560 made it impossible for the French to send further support. Instead, the Guise brothers sent ambassadors to negotiate a settlement. On 11 June 1560, their sister (Mary's mother) died, and so the question of future Franco-Scots relations was a pressing one. Under the terms of the Treaty of Edinburgh, signed by Mary's representatives on 6 July 1560, France and England undertook to withdraw troops from Scotland and France recognised Elizabeth's right to rule England. However, the seventeen-year-old Mary, still in France and grieving <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> refused to ratify the treaty.|$|E
5|$|With {{the other}} females not {{selected}} for immediate death, Frank {{was forced to}} strip naked to be disinfected, had her head shaved, and was tattooed with an identifying number on her arm. By day, the women were used as slave labour and Frank was forced to haul rocks and dig rolls of sod; by night, they were crammed into overcrowded barracks. Some witnesses later testified Frank became withdrawn and tearful when she saw children being led to the gas chambers; others reported that more often she displayed strength and courage. Her gregarious and confident nature allowed her to obtain extra bread rations <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> sister, and herself. Disease was rampant; before long, Frank's skin became badly infected by scabies. The Frank sisters were moved into an infirmary, which {{was in a state}} of constant darkness and infested with rats and mice. Edith Frank stopped eating, saving every morsel of food for her daughters and passing her rations to them through a hole she made at the bottom of the infirmary wall.|$|E
5|$|The hearing {{began with}} the {{swearing-in}} of the jury and introductions from various legal representatives, including a lawyer hired for Lucan by his mother. Thurston introduced the jury to the case and explained their duties. He had selected 33witnesses to be called over the following few days, including Veronica Lucan, who each day wore a dark coat and white headscarf. Thurston questioned her on her relationship with Lucan, her marriage, her financial affairs, her employment of Rivett and what had happened {{on the night of}} the attack. The Dowager Countess's Queen's Counsel attempted to ask Lady Lucan about the nature of their relationship, if she hated her husband, but Thurston ruled his line of questioning inadmissible. Woman Detective Constable Sally Blower, who had taken a statement from Frances on 20November 1974, read the young girl's words to the court. Frances had heard a scream, and a few minutes later had watched as her mother (blood on her face) and father had entered the room. Her mother had then sent her to bed. She later heard her father calling <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> asking where she was, and watched as he left the bathroom and walked downstairs. She also described how Sandra Rivett did not normally work on Thursday nights.|$|E

5|$|Though different, the children's stories {{share similar}} structures.

Will arrives too late and dives in after them, arriving in the night skies above Bellbridge, where he finds {{that he has the}} ability to fly without Nights or their Ideya. He rescues Helen, and the two attempt to save Nights, who has been imprisoned at the top of Bellbridge's clock tower. Reala arrives to stop their efforts and accepts Nights' challenge to battle. After defeating Reala, the trio prepare to face Wizeman. Both Will and Helen defeat Wizeman, who is subsequently destroyed. Since Wizeman kept all of his creations alive, Nights vanishes in a white light, bowing as if it were the end of a performance, and the children wake up crying. That evening, Helen plays her violin <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> in a crowded hall, while Will celebrates with his father after winning a football game. He then loses the ball and goes after it, only to come upon Helen playing her violin. The lights suffer a temporary blackout, and when they turn back on, Helen sees Will extending a friendly hand to her. Recognising each other from their adventures in Nightopia, the two reach for each other as it begins to snow. The final scene is of either child sleeping in their rooms at home as the camera pulls back towards Bellbridge's clock tower, atop which Nights is seen to be alive and peacefully watching over the city.|$|E
