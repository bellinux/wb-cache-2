5|$|As {{with all}} long-eared spaniels, Russian Spaniels require checks to prevent ear infections. The breed <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{inclination}} {{to gain weight}} easily, which can be prevented by controlling food intake. The Russian Spaniel can be prone to food allergies, which are usually identified at between 1 and 5 months of age with the most common allergens being chicken and carrots. There are no other breed-specific health issues currently known.|$|E
5|$|The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), {{established}} independently in 1952, {{has only}} the plain sun disc as its emblem. This {{is the only}} branch of service with an emblem that does not invoke the rayed Imperial Standard. However, the branch <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> ensign to fly on bases and during parades. The ensign was created in 1972, which was the third used by the JASDF since its creation. The ensign contains the emblem of the branch centered on a blue background.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{nucleic base}} of {{guanosine}} and 2'-deoxyguanosine <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> exocyclic amino group, its basicity is low {{to an extent}} {{that it does not}} react with phosphoramidites under the conditions of the coupling reaction. However, a phosphoramidite derived from the N2-unprotected 5'-O-DMT-2'-deoxyguanosine is poorly soluble in acetonitrile, the solvent commonly used in oligonucleotide synthesis. In contrast, the N2-protected versions of the same compound dissolve in acetonitrile well and hence are widely used. Nucleic bases adenine and cytosine bear the exocyclic amino groups reactive with the activated phosphoramidites under the conditions of the coupling reaction. By the use of additional steps in the synthetic cycle or alternative coupling agents and solvent systems, the oligonucleotide chain assembly may be carried out using dA and dC phosphoramidites with unprotected amino groups. However, these approaches currently remain in the research stage. In routine oligonucleotide synthesis, exocyclic amino groups in nucleosides are kept permanently protected over {{the entire length of the}} oligonucleotide chain assembly.|$|E

5|$|The most {{complete}} {{books on the}} Pony Express are The Story of the Pony Express and Saddles and Spurs by Raymond & Mary Settle and Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique as {{he was the first}} writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell's papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the mid-1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his annotations and notes, the writer's background here is unique and Settle <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well-researched account he had a good volume of footnotes, citations prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead, they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate, but simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development, as he put much time and effort into the annotations. Yet, the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account {{on the history of the}} Pony Express amongst many historians.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to find out the effect of auditor experience, competence, audit risk, ethics, {{adherence}} pressure, and gender to the accuracy of auditors opinion, directly or indirectly, by using auditor professional skepticism as an intervening variable. The research was conducted in KAP Kota Pekanbaru and KAP Medan City. The samples were obtained randomly as many as 79 respondents. The data were analyzed by using Partial Least Square (PLS) techniques with SmartPLS 2. 0 M 3 versions. The results showed that auditor experience <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant relation to the accuracy on giving opinion. Secondly, competence <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant relation to the accuracy on giving opinion. Third, audit risk <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant relation to the accuracy on giving opinion. Fourth, ethics <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant relation to the accuracy on giving opinion. Fifth, adherence pressure <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant relation to the accuracy on giving opinion. Sixth, gender <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant relationship to the accuracy of auditors opinion. From the indirect test, the result showed that the variable of auditors professional skepticism was able to strengthen the competence relation and situation of the accuracy of auditors opinion. In the other hand, the variable of auditors professional skepticism was not able to strengthen the relationship of ethics and pressure to the accuracy of auditors opinion.

25|$|The {{novel is}} a work of fiction set in the summer of 1977 that draws on places and {{historical}} events in India. The Patel Family's discussions of the political situation refer to the Emergency period of the mid-1970s, when Indira Gandhi's administration ruled by decree, curtailed press freedoms, and imprisoned political opponents. Pondicherry is a former French colony in India. It <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> Indian Coffee House and Botanical Gardens. The Botanical Garden had a zoo in 1977 but did not have any animals bigger than a deer. Munnar, the destination for the Patel family's vacation, is a small but popular hill station in Kerala. Madurai, also referenced in the novel, is a popular tourist and pilgrimage site in Tamil Nadu.|$|E
25|$|Macleod did not {{continue}} to work on insulin, but he remained active as a researcher, lecturer and author.

His theory about conversion of fats into carbohydrates remained unproven, despite his provision of several indirect proofs. He devoted his spare time to golf, motorcycling and painting. He was married to Mary W. McWalter, but they never had children. He died in 1935 in Aberdeen after several years of suffering from arthritis, despite which he remained active almost until his death. In 1933 he made a lecture tour of the US, and in 1934 he published the 7th edition of his book Physiology and Biochemistry in Modern Medicine.|$|E

25|$|The {{capacity}} for suffering and enjoying things {{is a prerequisite}} for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense {{to say that it was}} not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.|$|E
25|$|A {{professor}} of American history at Harvard University {{specializing in the}} history of gender and sexuality has researched gender roles and marriage trends for decades. Dr. Cott has testified for the plaintiffs in both United States v. Windsor and Hollingsworth v. Perry. Cott offered several examples of discriminatory practices involving marriages over the years which are no longer accepted, among them interracial marriages once being banned, American women who married foreigners once lost their citizenship and property, and the U.S. government at times not acknowledging Native American and Japanese marriages. Cott testified on February 28, 2014 that “The trend is moving toward same-sex gender neutrality/gender equality marriages; and the trend is moving toward same-sex marriages.” She also testified that “The Michigan Marriage Amendment obstructs that trend from continuing.” In explaining how marriage has evolved, Cott cited the 300-year ban on interracial marriage, which was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia in 1967. Cott said marriage is a “civil contract” that only be legally sanctioned by legislatures and the courts. In addressing religious objections to same-sex marriage, she said religious authorities have no legal standing over marriages even though they are allowed to conduct marriage ceremonies. Cott testified that there have been no laws in U.S. history that made procreation a requirement for marriage, an argument used by opponents of same-sex marriage. Under cross-examination by state attorney Michelle Brya, Cott admitted the state of Michigan <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> interest in marriage {{between a man and a}} woman for population purposes and sometimes economic reasons but did not believe those two issues should stand in the way of same-sex couples legally marrying.|$|E
