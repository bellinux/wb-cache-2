500|$|The {{property}} of tangency <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows.</b> First, a point, line or circle {{is assumed to}} be tangent to itself; hence, if a given circle is already tangent to the other two given objects, it is counted as a solution to Apollonius' problem. Two distinct geometrical objects are said to intersect if they have a point in common. By definition, a point is tangent to a circle or a line if it intersects them, that is, if it lies on them; thus, two distinct points cannot be tangent. If the angle between lines or circles at an intersection point is zero, they are said to be tangent; the intersection point is called a tangent point or a point of tangency. (The word [...] "tangent" [...] derives from the Latin present participle, tangens, meaning [...] "touching".) In practice, two distinct circles are tangent if they intersect at only one point; if they intersect at zero or two points, they are not tangent. The same holds true for a line and a circle. Two distinct lines cannot be tangent in the plane, although two parallel lines can be considered as tangent at a point at infinity in inversive geometry (see below).|$|E

2500|$|Geometrically, {{this action}} can be {{understood}} via a biplane geometry, which <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows.</b> A biplane geometry is a symmetric design (a set of points and {{an equal number of}} [...] "lines", or rather blocks) such that any set of two points is contained in two lines, while any two lines intersect in two points; this is similar to a finite projective plane, except that rather than two points determining one line (and two lines determining one point), they determine two lines (respectively, points). In this case (the Paley biplane, obtained from the Paley digraph of order 11), the points are the affine line (the finite field) F11, where the first line is defined to be the five non-zero quadratic residues (points which are squares: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9), and the other lines are the affine translates of this (add a constant to all the points). L2(11) is then isomorphic to the subgroup of S11 that preserve this geometry (sends lines to lines), giving a set of 11 points on which it acts – in fact two: the points or the lines, which corresponds to the outer automorphism – while L2(5) is the stabilizer of a given line, or dually of a given point.|$|E

[...] The corresponding variant of Chaitin's incompleteness theorem states that, {{in the context of}} a given axiomatic system for the natural numbers, there exists a number k such that no specific number can be proved to have complexity greater than k, and hence that no specific upper bound can be proven for Σ(k) (the latter is because [...] "the complexity of n is greater than k" [...] would be proved if [...] "n > Σ(k)" [...] were proved). As mentioned in the cited reference, for any axiomatic system of [...] "ordinary mathematics" [...] the least value k for which this is true is far less than 10↑↑10; consequently, in the context of ordinary mathematics, neither the value nor any upper-bound of Σ(10 ↑↑ 10) can be proven. (Gödel's first incompleteness theorem is illustrated by this result: in an axiomatic system of ordinary mathematics, there is a true-but-unprovable sentence of the form [...] "Σ(10 ↑↑ 10) = n", and there are infinitely many true-but-unprovable sentences of the form [...] "Σ(10 ↑↑ 10) < n".) ...|$|E
