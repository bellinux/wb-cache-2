500|$|In 1926 Yeats {{spent several}} weeks in London, likely visiting Olivia frequently. He showed regret for his {{behaviour}} in 1897, writing to her, [...] "I came across two early photographs of you yesterday... Who {{ever had a}} like profile?—a profile from a Sicilian coin. One looks back to one's youth as to a cup that a mad man dying of thirst left half tasted. I wonder <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> that?" [...] The two maintained their correspondence, as they had for many years.|$|E
500|$|Hello, all you Cyberheads! Welcome to the 90's {{version of}} intimacy. You can hear me... You can even see me... But you can't touch me... do you {{recognize}} my voice?... It's Madonna. Often imitated, but never duplicated. Or, should I say, often irritated? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it, you can download the sound file of my new single [...] "Secret", from my new album, Bedtime Stories, which comes out next month. I just shot the video in New York, and will be premiering an exclusive sample of it online. So check back soon. In the meantime, why don't you post me a message {{and let me know}} what you think of my new song. And by the way, don't believe any of those online imposters pretending to be me... ain't nothing like the real thing. Peace out.|$|E
2500|$|Manson has {{commented on}} the subject of children, saying that she [...] "just missed the whole baby calling. I feel a lot of women think you're a freak <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> that, and maybe I am strange but I never got that feeling. In some ways I wish I had that urge, because I adore children... I feel I can live quite happily with my decision." ...|$|E

60|$|TANNER. [patting {{him on the}} back] Bear it like a man, Tavy, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> it <b>like</b> an ass. It's the old game: she's not {{tired of}} playing with you yet.|$|R
2500|$|Sara {{states that}} {{if he wants to}} {{progress}} in his current relationship, he needs {{to find out what happened}} to move on emotionally. Since Tsukuru doesn't use the Internet, she'll help him getting started: [...] "We live in a pretty apathetic age, yet we're surrounded by an enormous amount of information about other people. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it, you can easily gather that information about them. Having said that, we still hardly know anything about people." [...] After using Google and Facebook to locate these former friends, she updates Tsukuru on their current whereabouts and even arranges for his travel tickets.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> that, we {{had better}} go on; but your fastidiousness may cost you something," [...] Stannard remarked, and Deering hit Jimmy's back.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not so," [...] she said. [...] "Come {{with me to}} her now: <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> that, {{she will}} be kind to you--how should it be otherwise?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a blamed {{cautious}} fellow," [...] Olsen rejoined in {{a meaning}} tone. [...] "However, you'll find {{me at the}} casino evenings <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> you'd <b>like</b> a talk, and now I'll get along." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We've {{all had a}} shock," [...] he said; [...] "and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> you'd <b>like</b> a drink, don't mind me. You needn't {{be afraid}} of setting me a bad example--I don't want anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah!" [...] cried Locker. [...] "Mrs. Easterfield, I envy you; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> {{performing}} {{the rest of}} your mission, you can depute it to me. I don't know anything at this moment that would give me so much joy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you'll {{come along}} {{to my room}} I'll give you a cigar," [...] he said. [...] "Then, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it, {{you can tell me}} about the thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They've {{had a big}} washout up the track," [...] he said. [...] "You can {{light out}} and admire the scenery for two hours, anyway, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you {{can take}} a bath three times a day, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it, on board," [...] Jocelyn continued. [...] "I'm afraid you won't find much else to do." ...|$|E
60|$|I surely {{need not}} add, dear lad, that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it, <b>you</b> will {{only have to}} pacify me by a long letter on general subjects, when I shall hasten to respond in recompense for my assault upon the postal highway.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} don't--you're not that kind. And I'm {{not going to}} offend you by {{offering}} it. Just the same, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> coming over to Snowshoe Island and paying me a visit, I'll treat you as well as I know how." ...|$|R
50|$|GeoArt {{is located}} at the {{northern}} top of lake Arre, just between Frederiksværk and Helsinge. Take the bus from either of the cities or a nice walk in the forest from the Castle ruins (2 km). Or <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> more <b>like</b> driving all the way just park right outside on one of the 40 parking lots.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] he said, [...] "I remember. Glad to see you, Mr. Urmston. Carrie's {{friends are}} always welcome. Hope you'll stay here a month <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here! It's half {{price to}} a poor man. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> coming back, {{on your own}} account--five pounds will do from you. There! there! Think of it!--think of it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The man nodded. [...] "It {{looks that}} way now, but you wait until I've fixed things up," [...] said he. [...] "Then <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> walking eight miles I'll go on with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{certainly}} do," [...] Whitney agreed. [...] "But I {{stick to}} my opinion that he has some particular reason for choosing a light machine." [...] He hesitated a moment. [...] "I don't want to butt in, and as the fellow's a family friend, it's delicate ground; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> you'd <b>like</b> a run through Galloway--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Frenson {{went up to}} Victor. [...] "See here, Captain, {{you must}} be hungry. I'll push a tray for <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> going down among those 'Indians.' I'll {{have to be honest}} with you. They're all up in the air down there and howling {{something}} fierce. I reckon I'd better hustle a turkey-leg for you." ...|$|R
50|$|Within {{the city}} limits, {{there is a}} {{reasonable}} taxi service (24 hrs a day) that is priced reasonably. Taxis can take <b>you</b> anywhere <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do not <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> walking.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{can walk}} till we get tired," [...] he said, [...] "and then <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it, we can jump into a taxi {{and take a}} ride around Central Park before we retire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{need not}} {{introduce}} Mr. Ormesby, who will kindly resume his place," [...] said Haldane pleasantly. [...] "Sit down and choose a cigar <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it. You sent word {{you wanted to}} talk to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Berrie, though equally gay, {{was not so}} sure of {{his ability}} to return to work. [...] "I reckon you'd better go easy till daddy gets back; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it we'll ride up to the post-office this afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} won't think it a liberty," [...] Jacob said simply, [...] "but I {{had to call}} at Tate's {{to get one of}} mine which I'd had restrung, and I saw such a delightfully {{balanced}} lady's racquet that I ventured to bring it down. I thought you might play with it, at any rate, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> didn't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> doing me the honour of accepting it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now that I've {{made good}} {{by getting the}} {{decision}} over Al., they'll be giving me a chance of a big fight. Maybe with Jimmy Garvin. Well, if that happens, see what I mean? I'll have to be going away somewhere and getting into training. I shouldn't {{be able to come}} and sit with <b>you.</b> But, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> gents <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it, I'd be mighty glad to come in till I'm wanted to go into training-camp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> an' Jacob <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> havin' a look around, I'll ask the commandant's {{permission}} {{to do a little}} scoutin' on our own account, agreein', in case we're laid by the heels, not to expect any help from this 'ere garrison." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The trooper {{has come}} in with the mail, and your friends in Canada {{are not going to}} worry you," [...] he said. [...] "Now, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> staying here a few days, it would be a favor to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> that," [...] he said, [...] "we'll {{investigate}} further. You'll find it's all right, though. They're {{only two}} young Oxford fellows. Extremely nice, too, though rather infected with this pseudo-Darwinian business. Ethics of evolution and all that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] replied Saunders, who did {{not stand}} up, [...] "go ahead; but you'll stop in the light; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> sending any of your {{partners}} to work a traverse round this bunch of fern, you can remember that I've got the forehead plumb on--you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Make {{yourself}} perfectly {{free of the}} place," [...] continued Aunt Jane, in an even tone, {{turning to}} Patricia, [...] "and have as good a time as you can.

6000|$|... 'Thank you,' said De Forest; 'but we {{want our}} break-fasts, and I expect you do too. Good-bye, Mr. Mayor! Delighted to see you at any time, but I hope I shan't have to, officially, for the next thirty years. Good-bye, madam. Yes. We're all given to nerves nowadays. I suffer from them myself. Good-bye, gentlemen all! You're under the tyrannous heel of the Board from this moment, but <b>if</b> ever <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> {{breaking}} your fetters you've only to let us know. This is no treat to us. Good luck!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I wouldn't laugh inside, either. Why should I? Something {{has hurt}} you--it never amuses {{me to see}} anybody hurt, no matter what hurts them. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> that you'd <b>like</b> {{to tell me what}} has hurt you I'll be glad to listen. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> think you'd rather not--that's all right, too, dear." ...|$|R
