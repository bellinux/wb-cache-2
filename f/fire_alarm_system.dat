Trains operating within the network typically travel at speed up to , and stop for about 20 seconds at each station. Automated station announcements are recorded in Hindi and English. Many stations have services such as ATMs, food outlets, cafés, convenience stores and mobile recharge. Eating, drinking, smoking and chewing of gum are prohibited in the entire system. The Metro also has a sophisticated <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> for advance warning in emergencies, and fire retardant material is used in trains {{as well as on}} the premises of stations. Navigation information is available on Google Transit. Since October 2010, the first coach of every train is reserved for women. However, last coaches are also reserved when the train changes tracks at the terminal stations in the Red, Green and Violet Lines. To make travelling by metro a smoother experience, Delhi Metro has launched its own official app for smartphone users,(iPhone and Android) that will provide information on various facilities like nearest metro station, fare, parking availability, tourist spots near metro stations, security and emergency helpline numbers.|$|E
25|$|The {{nursing home}} was {{equipped}} with a manual and automatic <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> that is connected directly to the fire alarm office of the Chicago Fire Department. The alarm system was designed to give out a code or box number of the alarm station when activated. The manual <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> consisted of two pull fire alarm boxes located on each floor and one fire alarm box located {{at the entrance of}} the building. The automatic fire alarms are activated by heat sensors which are located on the third floor, both stairways and in the storage closet. The automatic <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> also consisted of smoke detectors. On the third floor, three fire extinguishers and two public address loud speakers were installed.|$|E

25|$|The Hamlet plant {{had three}} {{previous}} fires, but no {{action was taken}} to prevent recurrence or to unlock the doors. The building had fires before Imperial took over as well, although these, too, were non-fatal. The Imperial plant at Cumming, Georgia, had two major fires, one of which, in 1989, caused $1.2 million worth of damage. The Hamlet plant had no <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> to warn workers farther back in the plant, {{and there were no}} sprinklers in the building.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Sikes was Captain of Hook and Ladder Co. No. 1, and Eustance Gibson was Captain of Excelsior Fire Engine and Hose Co. No. 2. Both were Civil War veterans, {{well known}} and {{respected}} early settlers. Many of the volunteer personnel composed of well known early settlers, merchants and professional men, many of whose descendants are living in Huntington today. In 1876 a night-watchman was hired at $3 per month {{to look after the}} station at night and sound the alarm in case of a fire. This was the first paid employee of the fire department. In 1879 J.W. Verlander became the first Fire Chief, and J.M. Boone became chief in 1880 until 1895. In 1881, four Gamewell Fire Alarm Boxes were installed in the downtown area. These fire alarm boxes were maintained by the telephone company. The system kept growing, and in 1928 construction was completed on a new Gamewell <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> <b>System</b> and Fire Alarm Headquarters were placed in operation in 1929, and remained in service until 7:32AM November 1, 1986. The Gamewell <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> <b>System</b> served the City of Huntington faithfully for 105 years. There never was a loss of life or major disaster because of a system malfunction.|$|E
25|$|A {{fire alarm}} box is an outdoor device used for notifying a fire {{department}} of a fire. Early boxes used the telegraph system and were the main method of calling the fire department to a neighborhood {{in the days before}} people had telephones. When the box is triggered, a spring-loaded wheel spins and taps out a signal onto the fire alarm telegraph wire, indicating the box number. The receiver at a fire station then can match the number to the neighborhood. The municipal <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> got its start in Massachusetts. It was invented by Moses G. Farmer, an engineer, and Dr. William Channing, a Harvard-educated Bostonian. Their revolutionary creation was installed in 1851 and consisted of 40 miles of wire and 45 boxes in Boston.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, {{the city}} built its first new fire station since 1926. The city's 100th {{birthday}} was commemorated when the Centennial Fire Station {{was placed in}} service on January 13, 1972, replacing the long-outmoded Central Fire Station. The Centennial Fire Station is still in service today. In 2004, a new station was opened that replaced St. Cloud station 4. The old station has been in service as a fire house for over 100 years. It now houses the traffic division for the City Of Huntington. The 1980s were tough for the department, several firefighters retired, and budget cuts forced the closure of several stations. The Gamewell <b>Fire</b> <b>Alarm</b> <b>System</b> was deactivated and Fire Alarm Headquarters closed. (The Old Fire Alarm Headquarters has {{been converted into a}} fire museum today.) Dispatching was combined with the Police Department, marking the beginning of 911 emergency dispatching.|$|E
25|$|In {{fiscal years}} 1991 and 1992, Congress {{recommended}} that $27.7 million be allocated for capital improvement projects at the Center, including $12 million for structural repairs {{to the garage}} and $15.7 million for structural and mechanical repairs, as well as projects for improving handicapped access. In 1994, Congress gave full responsibility to the Kennedy Center for capital improvement projects and facility management. From 1995 to 2005, over $200 million of federal funds were allocated to the Kennedy Center for long-term capital projects, repairs, and to bring the center into compliance with modern fire safety and accessibility codes. Improvements included renovation of the Concert Hall, Opera House, plaza-level public spaces, and a new <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>system.</b> The renovations projects were completed 13 to 50 percent over budget, due to modifications of plans during the renovations resulting in overtime and other penalties. Renovations to the Eisenhower Theater were completed in 2008.|$|E
500|$|Repairs to {{structural}} elements {{on the lower}} levels of 1 WTC were made following the 1993 bombing. The greatest damage occurred on levels B1 and B2, with significant structural damage also on level B3. [...] Primary structural columns were not damaged, but secondary steel members experienced some damage. Floors that were blown out needed to be repaired to restore the structural support they provided to columns. The slurry wall was in peril following the bombing and loss of the floor slabs which provided lateral support to counteract pressure from Hudson River water on the other side. [...] The refrigeration plant on sublevel B5, which provided air conditioning to the entire World Trade Center complex, was heavily damaged and replaced with a temporary system for the summer of 1993. [...] The <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> for the entire complex needed to be replaced, after critical wiring and signaling in the original system was destroyed in the 1993 bombing. Installation of the new system took years to complete, and replacement of some components was still underway in September 2001.|$|E

500|$|Green was awoken {{some time}} after midnight {{by the sound of}} the home's {{built-in}} <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>system.</b> She initially assumed that the sound was a false alarm caused by her dogs triggering the burglar alarm, but when she tried to shut off the alarm at the control panel in her bedroom and it continued sounding, she opened her bedroom door and found smoke in the hallway. She exited the house using a deck that connected to her first-floor bedroom. While standing on the deck, she heard her son Tim on the home's intercom system, calling to ask her what he should do. [...] "He used to be my thirteen-year-old", Green explained to police, and said that she had told him to stay in the house and wait for firefighters to rescue him. She had then knocked on a neighbor's door to ask them to call 9-1-1. When she returned to the house, she found Kate, who had climbed through her second-floor bedroom window, {{on the roof of the}} home's garage. Green called to Kate to jump, and Kate landed safely on the ground in front of Green.|$|E

2500|$|The Dupont Plaza Hotel {{fire and}} other fires {{of the era}} gave rise to several {{amendments}} to security policies in hotels around the world. One {{of the biggest problems}} at the time was the lack of standard fire safety requirements. The hotel included an unsprinklered 17-story tower that housed 423 guest rooms. The <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> in the tower was not working, and many guests were not aware of the fire until they saw or smelled it, heard someone shouting [...] "Fire", or heard firefighters responding. In 1987, there were four major fire codes across the United States with over 1,800 variations because of local codes and ordinances, with one code having significant fire protection requirements, and another having nothing.|$|E
2500|$|Smoke {{detectors}} {{are housed}} in plastic enclosures, typically shaped like a disk about [...] in diameter and [...] thick, but shape and size vary. Smoke can be detected either [...] optically (photoelectric) or by physical process (ionization), detectors may use either, or both, methods. Sensitive alarms {{can be used to}} detect, and thus deter, smoking in areas where it is banned. Smoke detectors in large commercial, industrial, and residential buildings are usually powered by a central <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>system,</b> which is powered by the building power with a battery backup. Domestic smoke detectors range from individual battery-powered units, to several interlinked mains-powered units with battery backup; with these interlinked units, if any unit detects smoke, all trigger even if household power has gone out.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ship was}} {{fitted with a}} {{temporary}} <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> but {{it was unclear whether}} this had operated. A separate alarm within the pavilion did sound when smoke and heat reached that area, [...] but the guards reported no ringing alarm before the fire was seen. Investigation afterwards discovered a faulty relay in the alarm panel which failed to switch power to the siren circuits when an alarm was triggered. However, the panel also contained a failed fuse in one siren circuit which suggested that the siren had activated but the fire shorted it out, and this might have also caused the relay to fail. The failed relay would have shut off power to the second siren circuit. Statements from workers suggested that weekly tests of the alarm system had not been carried out.|$|E
