30|$|The {{association}} of silica mineral–pyrite ± alunite ± kaolin-group mineral {{is the most}} common of the ash grains. Grains with this assemblage appear as opaque white-colored or opaque gray-colored under a binocular microscope. The original minerals have been completely replaced by silica mineral, alunite, kaolin-group mineral, rutile, and pyrite through hydrothermal alteration. The grains are classified into three types according to textures: pseudomorphic volcanic texture, fine-grained texture, and coarse mosaic texture. Grains with pseudomorphic volcanic texture are rich in vugs and preserve textures of the original volcanic rocks that are porphyritic, <b>hyalo-ophitic,</b> or hyalopilitic. Some vugs are rectangular in shape, indicating that the original crystals had been shed during the alteration, although some crystals have been replaced by silica mineral or kaolin (Fig.  3 e). Other vugs are spherical, vein-like, and irregular in shape, ranging from a few to several hundred µm. Pyrite and alunite crystals fill some of the vugs and cleavages of the pseudomorphic crystals. Grains with fine-grained texture show no sign of original rock texture but merely consist of fine-grained crystals. These grains are rich in µm-size vugs that are spherical or irregular and contain densely distributed submicron vugs forming a spongy texture. The coarse mosaic texture consists of tens- to µm-sized equant silica, euhedral to anhedral alunite, and intercrystalline voids. Flaky or massive crystals of alunite fill some of the voids.|$|E
