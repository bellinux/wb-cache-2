The thesis also documents a longitudinal teaching study which was initiated in 2010 and which gives us a base for discussion of some fundamental questions regarding {{the process of learning}} geometry for pupils in their early school years. The main objective here is to attempt to answer the following four didactic questions: In which way do pupils learn about geometrical objects? How do they share their geometrical knowledge, experience and discoveries with one another? How much (at what level) are they able to understand mathematical concepts that the official curricular documents (the Czech Framework for Education Program) place in later years of schooling? What phenomena are they able to grasp and describe using their mother tongue? The theoretical framework focuses on the learning process and the typology of mathematical problems in geometry.

40|$|For a {{photorealistic}} {{appearance of}} virtual objects rendered in augmented reality environments global illumination must be simulated. In this paper {{we present a}} real-time technique for generating reflections on virtual objects which are rendered into images or image sequences of real scenes.

Near and intermediate cube grains (≤ 5 deg and 5 deg to 10 deg misorientation, respectively, with exact cube orientation) are more unstable up to 60 pct reduction compared with the far cube grains (10 deg to 15 deg misorientation), and they rotate away to a rolling direction (RD) -rotated cube orientation ({ 013 }(100); denoted by C RD). In contrast, beyond 60 pct reduction, near and intermediate cube grains are more stable than far cube grains, which results in an overall increase in the stability of cube orientation. After 90 pct cold rolling, several cube bands adjacent to or surrounded by C RD bands and separated by low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) over large part of their lengths are observed.

Thus synopses are required to be generated timely to capture the underlying model for stream management systems. Traditionally, curve fitting through Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a powerful and efficient modeling tool. In order to further accelerate its processing efficiency, we propose Step-by-step Regression (SR) as a more efficient alternative. As revealed in experiments, it speeds up for more than 40 times. In addition, inspired by previous work, we integrated SR into <b>cube</b> <b>environment</b> through similar compression technique to perform online analytical processing and mining over data stream. Finally, experiments show that SR not only significantly alleviates the computation pressure on the front ends of data stream management systems, but also results in a much smaller stream cube for on line analysis and real-time surveillance. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method for {{real-time}} rendering of polygon mesh surfaces with reflection or refraction. The basic process {{is similar to}} dynamic <b>environment</b> mapping or <b>cube</b> mapping. Our proposed method is superior to those in that the accurate ray direction {{is reflected in the}} resulted image at every vertex on the mesh. Existing real-time techniques suffer from the differences between the viewpoint for the environment map and each reflection point. The proposed method minimizes this by finding an optimal viewpoint for the reflective or refractive mesh. With a sufficient number of vertices and map image resolutions, the users can render reflected images as accurate as ray tracing for all practical purposes, except for reflected objects around ray converging points of reflection on concave surfaces or refraction through convex lenses. The method can be applied to areas which require accuracy such as industrial design. Experiments with a CAD model of a car rear-view mirror and spectacle lenses exhibited results of sufficient quality for design verification. 1...|$|R

On this framework, the Phong reflectance model is implemented employing the spectral power distribution of light source and the spectral reflectance of surface simulating the color rendition of light sources and metamerism of surfaces. Multilayered thin film interference effects can also be handled within this framework with interactive speeds.

The project was started in September 2010 {{as a part of}} the Norwegian student satellite program run by NAROM (Norwegian Centre for Space-related Education). The NUTS project goals are to design, manufacture and launch a double CubeSat by 2014. As payload an IR-camera observing waves in the air-glow layer is planned, as well as a short-range RF experiment. The satellite will fly two transceivers in the amateur radio bands. Final year master students from several departments are the main contributors in the project and most of the system components are designed and built by students. Abstract Described in this paper is an assesement of different strategies for selecting and designing the Attitude Determination and Control System, ADCS, for the NUTS satellite, effectively providing the next iteration from the work that was conducted last year, placing much emphasis on the special requirements of a system that can not be repaired or maintained in a traditional way. Abstract Different options for sensors and actuators are explored and evaluated, looking for tried and tested products with a low chance of failure and concluding that Analog devices should be a safe and reliable provider of the inertial measurement units for our satellite. Abstract While the Extended Kalman Filter is the filtering method that is probably the most used in almost all applications, it has some very serious limitations that are especially important in such a demanding <b>environment</b> as a <b>cube</b> satellite. Two other methods for attitude estimation are evaluated, namely the Extended QUaternion ESTimator and newly developed nonlinear observers. While they both are very attractive options with many properties that fit with our requirements, there are still some questions as to wether they are as reliable as the proven EKF or not. Abstract The open source electronic prototyping platform Arduino is gaining foothold with hobbyists all over the world, and it is explored if it can also be used for rapid prototyping and if it is suitable for frequent design iterations in our satellite project. The freedom it provides coupled with a standard breadboard seems to make it a very good choice for any project needing to frequently change or improve it's design according to other hardware or software considerations. </p...|$|R

Featured artworks have been installed in public areas throughout the hotel, including the lobby, foyers and restaurant, to enable each piece to be contemplated at leisure. The exhibition will remain at the Grange Tower Bridge until the end of 2012, for viewing by all guests and public visitors to the hotel. Plastic Propaganda’s initiative is to display work in a public non-gallery arena and thereby provide the artists with an opportunity to reach mass audiences who would otherwise not see their works. The essence of the hotel’s public spaces reproduces the large white <b>cube</b> <b>environment</b> of a gallery, which reacts directly to the artwork being shown here. Review of the Grange exhibition by David Minton, Artist’s Newsletter The hotel is not a gallery; the primary intentions of its itinerant inhabitants are not the study of Pryor’s work, which waits with suggestions, possibilities, opportunities, questioning us tangentially, in passing, and in passing again. Creatures of our time and the moment, we are formed by the everyday – wallpaper, fabrics, cutlery, sounds, continuous infusions of taste through habitual exposure. Pryor’s work partakes of this dialogue of objects, now cacophonous, now incessantly whispered. The passing visitor, the participant on a course, the delivery driver, may not be objectively aware of his or her experience, but the physical presence of the work is felt and remembered; in an hotel the works insinuate themselves into the (un) conscious. In contrast to the ‘in your face scale’ of the work, the painting engages, pointedly, the corner of the eye in an initial moment of encounter prior to language. There is a sense of looking for something in and by the work, a kind of cultural burglary. He breaks into painting like a burglar in a posh house, rummaging through it, piling up stuff as he goes. The best burglary is an exercise in educated taste and antisocial behaviour. What about this? Or this, and this? His working methods, his materials, have the feel simultaneously of not quite overindulgence, and pleasure that has made the nerve ends raw. Pryor takes his influences by the hand and wanders off with them. Using colour not as a colourist, drawing not as a draughtsman, making marks in pursuit of experiences, he submits to and encourages paint’s desire to engulf, to reach its own limits, shapes, lines, movements, directions. Seeking their places, mark, form, colour, narrative, dance together and pull apart in a repeating dialectic of form and content, the physical work arising from insecurity and assertiveness in the presence of materials. In making his marks, all kinds of objects are (im) printed {{on the surface of the}} canvas - birds, toys, leaves, vegetables, roadkill. Impression is physical and visual, marks both impressions and giving the impression of…. not quite mechanical reproductions, through the process of infilling of detail central to Pryor’s printing from found objects we are made to feel uncertain - there is just enough and not quite sufficient. The works are almost not painted, but still are made with paint, spread out, sorted onto the canvas. The painting technique one of pushing the stuff around, caressing and spilling, spraying and squeezing it onto and into line and shape. Wash, impasto, a blob here, a turd-like mound there, and then a line of them. Like overweight starlings before the roost, they manage to remain airborne but heavily. This is painting against the grain. Much work is done on the horizontal canvas, Pollock-slowly, as it were, and then raised to the vertical. ‘The Deluge’ is a painting on a painting. Foliage and ripples are evident, and maybe sky. Pryor gathers his image toward the centre of the canvas, hemming it in with angular brackets. The detritus of the deluge floats, here a ladder, there a tin can, some leaves, a writhing ochre shape. What might be decomposing food drifts around. Perspectival depth is suggested by the projecting red and green corner of some long defunct magic carpet. The degraded deluge of commodity floats prettily; there is comfort in decadence. Pursuit of pleasure released from moral constraint may be the ultimate freedom. Our desires stare back at us from the paintings; colours seduce, paint often like skin, unreflective, soft. In ‘Love and Death’, the browns, blacks, golds, encourage a frisson of unease. In stark contrast to his sometimes luscious use of colour, the ‘Garden of Earthly Delights’ is a cool monochrome. Black, white, grey, a severed hand, palm open, a toy hammerhead shark, now deflated, soft toys once the object of true delight, nothing could be so inappropriately named as this Memorial Garden. What look like hares fight in an archived frieze along the bottom of the work. Above them insects and above the insects, the toys. There is a real sense of ambivalence throughout, of clinging to a cliff-face with an almost overwhelming desire for blessed release. Pryor’s objects are in this sense defiant. The paint that smothers them draws our attention, echoes the children whose toys they once were. “Hey! Look!”. Pigmented fluid gently seduces, puts its prey at ease, settles a little death over its objects of desire; think with the body, feel with the mind. Working with the reluctance of one who feels the fear of his real desires, Pryor defies his work not to be painting. ...|$|R
