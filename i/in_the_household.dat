5|$|For example, Bina Agarwal {{and others}} have critiqued the {{mainstream}} model and helped provide {{a better understanding of}} intra-household bargaining power. Agarwal shows that a lack of power and outside options for women hinders their ability to negotiate within their families. Amartya Sen shows how social norms that devalue women's unpaid work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>household</b> often disadvantage women in intra-household bargaining. These feminist economists argue that such claims have important economic outcomes which must be recognized within economic frameworks.|$|E

5|$|Although Athenian {{women were}} not legally {{permitted}} to dispose of large sums of money, they frequently had large dowries which supported them throughout their lives.
