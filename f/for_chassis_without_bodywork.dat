5000|$|The Ford E-Series (also {{known as}} the Ford Econoline and Ford Club Wagon {{throughout}} various stages of its production) is a range of full-size vans produced by Ford Motor Company. Introduced for the 1961 model year as the replacement for the Ford F-Series panel van, four generations of the model line have been produced. In addition to cargo van and passenger van body styles, the Ford E-Series has been produced as a cutaway van chassis and stripped <b>chassis</b> (a <b>chassis</b> <b>without</b> <b>bodywork).</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{optimized}} multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) {{antenna system}} is proposed. It {{is based on}} the traditional planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) design, accommodated on a printed circuit board (PCB) for mobile handsets and operating at 2 1. 6 GHz. The PIFA dimension is reduced by 30 % with meander structure etched on the conventional PIFA. Diversity performances of a parallel dual-element Meander PIFA array are evaluated in different statistical propagation environments <b>for</b> both <b>without</b> <b>chassis</b> and with chassis configurations. It is found that an optimized Meander PIFA with chassis can still keep nearly the same good diversity performance as the case <b>without</b> <b>chassis.</b> It has also been shown that the dual-element Meander PIFA can work well in different statistical environments...|$|R

50|$|A {{rolling chassis}} is the chassis {{of a car}} or truck, {{assembled}} together with the engine and drivetrain, but <b>without</b> <b>bodywork.</b> Such rolling <b>chassis</b> were built by car makers, for supply to coachbuilders who would later build the bodywork.

50|$|Svenska Automobilfabriken (SAF) was a Swedish car {{manufacturer}} founded in Bollnäs in December 1919. It assembled US cars based on Pullman Motor Co chassis bought when Pullman went bankrupt in 1917, and fitted them with coachworks and adapted them for Swedish conditions. The engine was a Golden, Belknapp & Swartz giving 32 hp. It was {{fitted with a}} Stromberg carburettor and had a 50-litre gasoline tank. People who earlier had worked on Rengsjöbilen were among the employees. SAF bought 40 Pullman chassis, and built 28 SAF cars before the company went bankrupt in 1921. The remaining stock (with or <b>without</b> <b>bodywork)</b> was sold out over a few years.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{sub-frame}} of 2500 HP fracturing {{truck is}} an important component, which connects to chassis with the vehicle equipment. Because the sub-frame bears tension, torsion and bending loads, enough rigidity and intensity are necessary <b>for</b> <b>chassis.</b> Based on the Pro/E software, the 3 -D model of frame and sub-frame was constructed. Using topology optimization method, layout of the sub-frame was determined and location of crossbeams was arranged. Meanwhile, number and location of the connectors between main frame and sub-frame was analyzed, analysis result shows that carrying capacity of chassis can be enhanced without increasing connectors number of main frame and sub-frame. Some available reference can be provided <b>for</b> <b>chassis</b> manufacture...|$|R
