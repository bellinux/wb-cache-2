40|$|Abstract — The {{effects of}} {{fringing}} capacitances on the high-frequency performance of T-gate GaN high-electron mobil-ity transistors (HEMTs) are investigated. Delay time components have been analyzed for gate-recessed InAlN/GaN HEMTs {{with a total}} gate length of 40 nm and fT / fmax of 225 / 250 GHz. It is found that the gate <b>extrinsic</b> <b>capacitance</b> contributes significantly to the parasitic delay—approximately 50 % of the total delay in these highly scaled devices. The gate <b>extrinsic</b> <b>capacitance</b> comprises two components: 1) parallel plate capacitances between the T-gate and the surrounding electrodes and 2) the fringing capacitance between the gate stem and the access regions. Detailed study of the gate electrostatics reveals that the later, the fringing capacitance between the T-gate stem and the device access region, ultimately determines the lower limit of the <b>extrinsic</b> <b>capacitance</b> Cext; this minimum Cext can be realize...|$|E
40|$|This work {{studies the}} {{behavior}} of both gate-to-channel capacitance (CGC) and source-channel-drain/well leakage in metal-gate/high-κ/Ge PMOS technology (W = 10 μm and L = 10; 5; 1 μm) under development at IMEC. The hole drift-mobility of germanium is ~ 4 X that of silicon, leading researchers to evaluate germanium as a possible channel material replacement for PMOS expected at the 32 nm technology node. In particular this study focuses on—but is not restricted to—(1) {{the presence of a}} parasitic gate-to-channel capacitance (CGC), the large non-ideal trap assisted conductance which contributes to it, and its function versus Ge-PMOS architecture and gate length; (2) the existence of C-V tool compensation error due to CGC measurement technique resulting in conductance measurement error; (3) the presence of large source-channel-drain/well leakages characterized using a new MOS gated-diode measurement technique; (4) <b>extrinsic</b> <b>capacitance</b> (CEXT), flatband voltage (VFB), and effective oxide thickness (EOT) parameter extraction with discussion on inversion layer quantization. This study found that excessive current leakages from the Ge-PMOS source-anddrain into the channel led to a chuck-dependent parasitic capacitance during CGC measurement. This excessive leakage is identified as a trap-assisted leakage through both AC and DC analysis. The chuck-dependent parasitic capacitance was an unexpected side effect of the PMOS architecture: namely the lack of N-Well isolation. The parasitic capacitance—dependent on both applied bias and frequency—was separated into two main capacitive components: a frequency-dependent source/well and drain/well trapassisted leakage capacitance (CPara_SD) and a frequency-voltage-dependent gate-induced iv junction leakage capacitance (CPara_GIJL). A third parasitic capacitance due to interface trap (IT) contribution (CIT) during channel depletion was also identified. This study also found that the new MOS gated-diode measurement technique designed to separate and evaluate the source, channel, and drain leakage components is superior to typical VGS versus IDS methods when attempting to quantify the CGC measurement. The MOS gated-diode configuration allowed for temperature-dependent analysis and activation energy extraction (EA), thereby providing a means to confirm individual leakage components: diffusion; Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH); trap-assisted leakage (TAL). TAL components include: Poole-Frenkel (PF); phonon-assisted tunneling (PAT); trap-to-band tunneling (TBT). In conclusion, {{it was found that the}} source-channel-drain/well leakages and hence parasitic capacitances of PMOS built on relaxed germanium-on-silicon can be minimized by reducing the source/drain area, reducing the source/drain-to-gate contact distance, while increasing both the gate length and measurement frequency. The dominance of SRH and TAL during Ge-PMOS operation disagrees with diffusion dominance predicted by theory and as a result opens the door for future research. Future research includes Ge- PMOS fabrication on substrates free of dislocations—to minimize SRH and TAL current leakage contributions—so as to compare leakage performance...|$|E

The transistor is designed for use in high-speed analog or digital applications -where reduced parasitic capacitances and resistances are essential. The device design is unique in reducing <b>extrinsic</b> base/collector <b>capacitance</b> over single self-aligned bipolar transistors by using two relatively independent process techniques. First, base/collector capacitance is reduced by eliminating all misalignment tolerances between {{the outer edge of}} the collector and the base contact. Second, by using monocrystalline silicon instead of polycrystalline silicon base contacts, the contact area or 2 ̆ 2 footprint 2 ̆ 2 may be reduced without increasing contact resistance. Scaled-up versions of the high-speed transistor design were fabricated, electrically tested, and compared with computer simulations. Monocrystalline silicon extrinsic base contacts were fabricated using selective epitaxial growth (SEG) and epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) in a reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition reactor using dichlorosilane and HCl in an H 2 carrier gas. Single self-aligned transsistors (SSTs) with polycrystalline silicon contacted emitters wlere fabricated using monocrystalline silicon SEG base extrinsic contacts to examine the emitter/base junction. SSTs demonstrated maximum current gains of approximately 100, with nearly ideal junction behavior. Double self-aligned transistors (DSTs) were fabricated using both EL 0 and polycrystalline silicon extrinsic base contacts to examine the full device. DSTs yielded maximum current gains of between 100 and 160 with nearly ideal emitter/base junction behavior. Base/collector junctions, however, showed degraded ideality and increased leakage currents over the SSTs. The problem is believed to be related to the increased fabrication complexity required for the DSTs over the SSTs. Reverse biased junction capacitances for SSTs and DSTs were correlated to unit area values and demonstrated good agreement over different device sizes.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{electronics}} and microsystem applications has always stimulated the semiconductor industry to further down-scaling and to develop new architectures for the fundamental devices. As these semiconductor devices, such as transistors, {{are becoming more and}} more complex, it is required to provide more reliable, yet simple enough, models for successful and rapid design. The ultimate goal should not only be a powerful technology, which can support the needs of industry and society, but also valid models to decrease the fabrication cost, product-to-market time, and increase the success rate by rapid successful prototyping. As the operating frequency of emerging applications is increasing, more wideband models are required. This work is focused on theoretical and practical model development which can accurately reproduce device behavior at very high frequencies, like mm-wave (30 - 300 GHz). As the operating frequencies are increasing, the onset of non-quasi-static effects is reached. To account for non-quasi-static effects, we established a theoretical foundation than can support different sources of non-quasi-static effects present at mm-wave frequencies. A small-signal model that can physically support these non-quasi-static effects is proposed. Then the model development, and parameter extraction is demonstrated based on state-of-the-art S-parameters measurements. The so called non-quasi-static-effects play a significant role under large-signal conditions as well. Since the current state-of-the-art models cannot address all the non-quasi-static effects, a technology independent theory and foundation was established to develop a large-signal model from a small-signal model. The extracted models have been verified by state-of-the-art measurements, including both small- and large-signal. Finally, the model implementation in Electronic Design Automation packages was investigated and solutions were demonstrated for some examples of these packages. 1 General Introduction 1. 1 Semiconductor technologies 1. 2 Technology models for device design 1. 3 Device models for circuit design 1. 4 Current status on device models for circuit design 1. 5 Objectives and scope of this work 1. 6 Organization of the PhD thesis 2 Advanced Microwave Transistors and Modeling Concept 2. 1 Introduction 2. 2 SOI Multi-Fin MOSFETs 2. 3 SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistor 2. 4 Overview of modeling aspects 2. 4. 1 Linearity and nonlinearity 2. 4. 2 Quasi-static and non-quasi-static 2. 4. 3 Memory effects 2. 4. 3. 1 Short-term memory effects 2. 4. 3. 2 Long-term memory effects 2. 5 Overview of modeling approaches for transistors 2. 5. 1 Technology-based physical models 2. 5. 2 Equivalent-circuit based models 2. 5. 2. 1 Measurement-based models 2. 5. 2. 2 Physics-based models 2. 5. 3 Behavioral models 2. 5. 4 Comparison between different models 2. 6 Measurements for model extraction 2. 6. 1 Vector network analyzer 2. 6. 2 Large-signal network analyzer 2. 7 Conclusion 3 Linear Characterization and Modeling of Multi-Fin MOSFETs and Varactors 3. 1 Introduction 3. 2 Key process information 3. 3 Linear model for Multi-Fin MOSFET (FinFET) 3. 3. 1 Scattering parameters as a black box model 3. 3. 2 Equivalent-circuit based linear model 3. 4 Linear equivalent-circuit based model extraction 3. 4. 1 Extraction of interconnections 3. 4. 2 Extraction of extrinsic shell elements 3. 4. 3 Extraction of intrinsic shell elements 3. 5 Linear model for FinFET transistors with kink-effect 3. 6 Model implementation in EDA packages 3. 6. 1 Transmission line implementation 3. 6. 2 Lumped element implementation 3. 7 Linear model for Multi-Fin varactors 3. 8 Measurement and data acquisition 3. 9 Conclusions 4 Nonlinear Characterization and Modeling of Multi-Fin MOSFETs and Varactors 4. 1 Introduction 4. 2 De-embedding for large-signal measurements 4. 3 Quasi-static nonlinear model for Multi-Fin MOSFET (FinFET) transistors 4. 4 Non-quasi-static nonlinear model for Multi-Fin MOSFET (FinFET) transistors 4. 5 NQS nonlinear model formulation and generation 4. 6 Adapted linear model for large-signal simulations for Multi-Fin MOSFET transistors 4. 7 Quasi-static nonlinear model for Multi-Fin varactors 4. 8 Implementation of nonlinear models in EDA packages 4. 8. 1 QS Nonlinear model in ADS 4. 8. 2 QS Nonlinear model in Cadence 4. 8. 3 NQSCC nonlinear and ALLS model implementation 4. 9 Significance of time-delay in large-signal models 4. 10 Conclusions 5 Linear Characterization and Modeling of SiGe Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors 5. 1 Introduction 5. 2 SiGe HBT DC model extraction 5. 3 High frequency linear model for SiGe HBT 5. 4 SiGe HBT small-signal model extraction 5. 4. 1 <b>Extrinsic</b> <b>capacitances</b> extraction 5. 4. 2 Extrinsic resistances and inductances extraction 5. 4. 3 Intrinsic shell extraction 5. 5 Conclusions 6 General Conclusions Appendix A Appendix B Bibliography List of publications Curriculum vitaenrpages: 220 status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|The {{conventional}} way {{of changing}} the magnetization of a thin film is usually realized through applying an external magnetic field. In recent years, {{it has been found}} both theoretically [1 – 3] and experimentally [4, 5] that a spin-polarized current which carries more spin up or spin down electrons can also change the magnetization when passing through the thin film. This effect helps to generate steady precession of the free-layer magnetization in a spin valve structure by an injected spin-polarized current, which results in a periodic variation of the device resistance and forms spin-torque oscillators (STOs) [6 – 12]. The advantages of the STO are its capability of generating microwave with ultra-wide bandwidth (from 100 MHz to 60 GHz) and its easy modulation at very high frequency. Its potential application as microwave generator has received unprecedented attention. Among the many unrevealed problems remained in the STO area, much research effort focuses on the STO authentic modeling. However, the capacitance effect is not considered at all in most previous studies [13 – 15]. Capacitance effect [13 – 15] being introduced by intrinsic sources (parasitic capacitance due to the interaction between the multilayer thin films in STOs) and <b>extrinsic</b> sources (lead <b>capacitance</b> due to the connection between the external IC and STOs) is inevitable during the preparation process of spin-torque oscillators (typically GMR multilayers). Therefore, in order to accurately reflect the characteristics of prepared spin-torque oscillator devices, it is highly essential to explore the capacitance effect on oscillation characteristics and switching characteristics. Meanwhile, this research not only helps to establish the foundation for capacitance-involved STO modeling but also helps to reveal the origin of capacitance effect in nanodevices. Since our findings could be applied in the modeling of authentic STO, which is highly beneficial for supporting and guiding the fabrication process in nanotechnology and nanoscience industry.|$|R
