60|$|While {{on our way}} up we came to {{an object}} which filled us with much interest. This was the stump of a tree that had evidently been cut down with an axe! So, then, we were not the first who had viewed this {{beautiful}} isle. The hand of man had been at work there before us. It now began to recur to us again that perhaps the island was inhabited, although we had not seen any traces of man until now. But a second glance at the stump convinced us that we had not more reason to think so now than formerly; for {{the surface of the}} wood was quite decayed and partly covered with fungus and <b>green</b> <b>matter,</b> so that it must have been cut many years ago.|$|E
60|$|The hut or cottage {{was rude}} and simple in its construction. It was {{not more than}} twelve feet long by ten feet broad, and {{about seven or eight}} feet high. It had one window, or rather a small frame in which a window might perhaps once have been, but which was now empty. The door was {{exceedingly}} low, and formed of rough boards, and the roof was covered with broad cocoa-nut and plantain leaves. But every part of it {{was in a state of}} the utmost decay. Moss and <b>green</b> <b>matter</b> grew in spots all over it. The woodwork was quite perforated with holes; the roof had nearly fallen in, and appeared to be prevented from doing so altogether by the thick matting of creeping plants and the interlaced branches which years of neglect had allowed to cover it almost entirely; while the thick, luxuriant branches of the bread-fruit and other trees spread above it, and flung a deep, sombre shadow over the spot, as if to guard it from the heat and the light of day. We conversed long and in whispers about this strange habitation ere we ventured to approach it; and when at length we did so, it was, at least on my part, with feelings of awe.|$|E

6000|$|The {{border of}} the lake is formed of mud: and in this {{numerous}} large crystals of gypsum, {{some of which are}} three inches long, lie embedded; whilst on the surface others of sulphate of soda lie scattered about. The Gauchos call the former the [...] "Padre del sal," [...] and the latter the [...] "Madre;" [...] they state that these progenitive salts always occur on the borders of the salinas, when the water begins to evaporate. The mud is black, and has a fetid odour. I could not at first imagine the cause of this, but I afterwards perceived that the froth which the wind drifted on shore was coloured green, as if by confervae; I attempted to carry home some of this <b>green</b> <b>matter,</b> but from an accident failed. Parts of the lake seen from a short distance appeared of a reddish colour, and this perhaps was owing to some infusorial animalcula. The mud in many places was thrown up by numbers of some kind of worm, or annelidous animal. How surprising it is that any creatures should be able to exist in brine, and that they should be crawling among crystals of sulphate of soda and lime! And what becomes of these worms when, during the long summer, the surface is hardened into a solid layer of salt? ...|$|E
60|$|The purple fluid or {{granular}} matter which fills {{the cells of}} the glands differs to a certain extent from that within {{the cells of the}} pedicels. For when a leaf is placed in hot water or in certain acids, the glands become quite white and opaque, whereas [page 8] the cells of the pedicels are rendered of a bright red, with the exception of those close beneath the glands. These latter cells lose their pale red tint; and the <b>green</b> <b>matter</b> which they, as well as the basal cells, contain, becomes of a brighter green. The petioles bear many multicellular hairs, some of which near the blade are surmounted, according to Nitschke, by a few rounded cells, which appear to be rudimentary glands. Both surfaces of the leaf, the pedicels of the tentacles, especially the lower sides of the outer ones, and the petioles, are studded with minute papillae (hairs or trichomes), having a conical basis, and bearing on their summits two, and occasionally three or even four, rounded cells, containing much protoplasm. These papillae are generally colourless, but sometimes include a little purple fluid. They vary in development, and graduate, as Nitschke* states, and as I repeatedly observed, into the long multicellular hairs. The latter, as well as the papillae, are probably rudiments of formerly existing tentacles.|$|E
60|$|At Coquimbo the {{porphyritic}} conglomerate formation approaches {{nearer to}} the Pacific {{than in any}} other part of Chile visited by me, being separated from the coast by a tract only a few miles broad of the usual plutonic rocks, {{with the addition of a}} porphyry having a red euritic base. In proceeding to the mines of Arqueros, the strata of porphyritic conglomerate are at first nearly horizontal, an unusual circumstance, and afterwards they dip gently to S.S.E. After having ascended to a considerable height, we come to an undulatory district in which the famous silver mines are situated; my examination was chiefly confined to those of S. Rosa. Most of the rocks in this district are stratified, dipping in various directions, and many of them are of so singular a nature, that at the risk of being tedious I must briefly describe them. The commonest variety is a dull-red, compact, finely brecciated stone, containing much iron and innumerable white crystallised particles of carbonate of lime, and minute extraneous fragments. Another variety is almost equally common near S. Rosa; it has a bright green, scanty basis, including distinct crystals and patches of white carbonate of lime, and grains of red, semi-micaceous oxide of iron; in parts the basis becomes dark green, and assumes an obscure crystalline arrangement, and occasionally in parts it becomes soft and slightly translucent like soapstone. These red and green rocks are often quite distinct, and often pass into each other; the passage being sometimes affected by a fine brecciated structure, particles of the red and <b>green</b> <b>matter</b> being mingled together. Some of the varieties appear gradually to become porphyritic with feldspar; and all of them are easily fusible into pale or dark-coloured beads, strongly attracted by the magnet. I should perhaps have mistaken several of these stratified rocks for submarine lavas, like some of those described at the Puente del Inca, had I not examined, a few leagues eastward of this point, a fine series of analogous but less metamorphosed, sedimentary beds belonging to the gypseous formation, and probably derived from a volcanic source.|$|E

It is especially valuable during drought when it persists after other grasses die. It can be cut into hay when still green.

50|$|Individuals are a sandy grey colour, {{with white}} chest hairs and a paler underbelly. The {{tail of the}} species is long and has the {{characteristic}} hopping mouse brush at the tip. This tail morphology is thought to aid balance when travelling at speed.

Up to eight animals, different ages and sex, have been found in a single burrow. N. mitchellii is known to have a lifespan of up to five years in the laboratory and this is thought to be a strategy evolved to combat the breeding-constraints of lengthy periods of drought. It has also been found that this species is less able to cope with water deprivation than other species of the genus. Notomys mitchellii produces concentrated urine to conserve water, but in a different way to more arid-dwelling rodents. The diet of N. mitchellii is also thought to consist of more roots and <b>green</b> <b>matter</b> than that of other species of the genus: animals captured in drought conditions had stomach contents consisting of some 85% roots, 11% green leaf and 4% seed.|$|E
5000|$|This {{effect on}} both humans and {{materials}} has consequences for harvesting.

However, this shielding is imperfect, since it simply slows down the process of conversion, it being based upon {{the fact that some}} materials take longer for Tiberium to convert than others (there are other shields against Tiberium.
