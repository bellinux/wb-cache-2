5|$|In 2011, The Exorcist was re-released in a 40th Anniversary Edition in paperback, hardcover, and {{audiobook}} formats {{with new}} cover artwork. As described by Blatty, this new, updated edition features new and revised material. The 40th Anniversary Edition of The Exorcist {{will have a}} touch of new material in {{it as part of}} an all-around polish of the dialogue and prose. First time around I never had the time (meaning the funds) to do a second draft, and this, finally, is it. With forty years to think about <b>it,</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> little changes were inevitable – plus one new character in a totally new very spooky scene. This is the version I would like to be remembered for. Tor/Forge have also re-published The Ninth Configuration and Legion, with new, updated cover artwork.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010 Marvel Studios held a Thor panel at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International {{during which}} Kenneth Branagh and Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, Tom Hiddleston, and Clark Gregg {{discussed}} {{the film and}} showed some clips from <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> days later, this footage was leaked on the internet. The first television advertisement was broadcast during Super Bowl XLV on the Fox network in the United States. The rate for advertising during the game was approximately $3 million per 30-second spot. Marvel Studios and Acura launched a joint viral marketing promotion at the 2011 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo. Other official promotional partners included Burger King, Dr. Pepper, 7 Eleven, and Visa. In May 2011 Marvel Entertainment's President of Print, Animation and Digital, Dan Buckley, and Marvel Comics Editor-In-Chief, Axel Alonso, rang the NYSE closing bell in celebration of the theatrical release of Thor.|$|E

Concerned about Walt's apparent disappearance, she calls their lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), but he has become paranoid from Walt's falling out with Gus and is too busy checking his office for listening devices. Skyler hires a locksmith to break into Walt's condo for her, claiming it belongs to her. When he hesitates {{to do so without}} identification, Skyler claims her purse was stolen and fakes a panic attack until he finally agrees. She finds little of interest inside the condo. Elsewhere, Skyler's sister Marie (Betsy Brandt) struggles to maintain her composure while caring for her belligerent husband Hank (Dean Norris), who is still bedridden after the attempt on his life.|$|E
5|$|Most turbellarians have pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes"), {{one pair}} in most species, but two or even three pairs in some. A few large species have many eyes in {{clusters}} over the brain, mounted on tentacles, or spaced uniformly {{around the edge}} of the body. The ocelli can only distinguish the direction from which light is coming and enable the animals to avoid <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> groups have statocysts, fluid-filled chambers containing a small, solid particle or, in a few groups, two. These statocysts are thought to be balance and acceleration sensors, as that is the function they perform in cnidarian medusae and in ctenophores. However, turbellarian statocysts have no sensory cilia, and how they sense the movements and positions of the solid particles is unknown. On the other hand, most have ciliated touch-sensor cells scattered over their bodies, especially on tentacles and around the edges. Specialized cells in pits or grooves on the head are probably smell sensors.|$|E
5|$|On 20 May 1775, Abu al-Dhahab, {{having been}} {{encouraged}} by the Porte to eradicate Zahir's influence, captured Jaffa and slaughtered its male inhabitants. News of the massacre spurred the people of Acre into a mass panic, with its residents fleeing and storing their goods in the city's Khan al-Ifranj (the French Caravanserai) for safekeeping. On 24 May, Zahir also departed the city, leaving for Sidon. Ali al-Zahir, subsequently entered it and declared himself governor. However, Ali's Maghrebi troops abandoned him and looted the city as Abu al-Dhahab's troops approached <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days later. They proceeded to conquer Sidon by sea, prompting Zahir to seek shelter with Shia allies in Jabal Amil. Some of Zahir's sons attempted to secure their own peace with Abu al-Dhahab, but the latter became ill and died on 10 June, causing the collapse and chaotic withdrawal of his Egyptian troops from Acre. Zahir re-entered the city two days later and reestablished order {{with the assistance of}} Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli. However, the setback of Abu al-Dhahab's death did not preclude the Sublime Porte from attempting to check Zahir's power and Sidon remained in Ottoman hands.|$|E

5|$|On {{the right}} flank, {{north of the}} road, the North Koreans overran the {{battalion}} observation post and B Company's outpost line. This high ground changed hands three times during the day. While the infantry fight was in progress, and shortly after the first tank penetration, five more T-34s came around the road bend toward the US 71st Tank Battalion. Check had called for an air strike when the first tanks appeared. Three F-80 Shooting Stars arrived and immediately dived on the approaching group of tanks, destroying three of them with 5-inch rockets. Altogether, bazooka, artillery, and air strikes knocked out six North Korean tanks during the morning, either within or {{on the edge of}} the 1st Battalion position. In its first engagement with American troops, the NK 2nd Division lost all but two of the eight tanks that had been attached to <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days earlier at Chongju.|$|E
5|$|The {{police did}} not find the {{silencer}} in the cupboard. One of Bamber's cousins found it on 10 August, with {{what appeared to be}} flecks of red paint and blood, and took it to another of the cousin's homes; it took the police a further three days to collect <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> days after that, it was the cousins who found a scratch on the red mantelpiece that the prosecution said was caused by the silencer during a struggle for the gun; that accounted for the fleck of red paint. The Bible found near Sheila was not examined at all. Journalist David Connett writes that a hacksaw blade that might have been used to gain entry to the house lay in the garden for months. Officers did not take contemporaneous notes; those who had dealt with Bamber wrote down their statements weeks later. The bodies were released days after the murders, and three of them (June, Nevill and Sheila) were cremated. Bamber's clothes were not examined until one month later. Ten years later all blood samples were destroyed.|$|E

This decision was popular in Khartoum, but caused controversy in Britain.|$|E

Next, he takes a distressingly small Caucasian skull, shakes hard, and pushes mightily at the foramen magnum with his thumb.

25|$|In 1871, {{the trains}} first reached Albany, {{connecting}} {{it to other}} towns in the valley. The arrival of the first train was celebrated as the greatest event in Albany's history.

The train brought the farmers' markets closer to the city, as stagecoaches and steamboats gave way to the railroad. The world's longest wooden railroad drawbridge was built in 1888 for the Albany-Corvallis run. By 1910, 28 passenger trains departed daily from Albany going in five directions.|$|E

25|$|At this time, {{tensions}} became heightened {{with the}} Venetians {{as a slave}} of the Ottoman commander of Athens fled to the Venetian fortress of Coron (Koroni) with 100,000 aspers from his master's treasury. The Venetians refused to hand him back, and in retaliation, Ömer attacked the port town of Lepanto (Nafpaktos) in November 1462 but failed to capture <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> months later, Isa Bey, governor of the Morea, took the Venetian fortress of Argos through treason.

Justin gives Paige some money to get on her way, but by now he wants an escape from his own life. He persuades Paige to take him with her.
