In addition, it proposed the end of communal, tribal lands. Continuing the struggle over land and assimilation, the US proposed the end to the tribal lands held in common, and allotment of lands to tribal members <b>in</b> <b>severalty</b> (individually). The US declared land in excess of the registered households needs to be [...] "surplus" [...] to the tribe, and took it for sale to new European-American settlers. In addition, individual ownership meant that Native Americans could sell their individual plots. This would also enable new settlers to buy land from those Native Americans who wished to sell. The US government set up the Dawes Commission to manage the land allotment policy; it registered members of the tribe and made allocations of lands.|$|E

No matter {{what ought to be}} the relations between such settlements and the aborigines, the fact is they do not harmonize well, and one or the other has to give way in the end. A system which looks to the extinction of a race is too horrible for a nation to adopt without entailing upon itself the wrath of all Christendom and engendering in the citizen a disregard for human life and the rights of others, dangerous to society. I see no substitute for such a system, except in placing all the Indians on large reservations, as rapidly as it can be done, and giving them absolute protection there. As soon as they are fitted for it they should be induced to take their lands <b>in</b> <b>severalty</b> and to set up Territorial governments for their own protection. For full details on this subject I call your special attention to the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.|$|E

The communal benefits were apportioned to tribe members according to tribal law and custom. Generally, Indians held the land in a communal fashion.

Original plans were for land ownership to be held in common, as other American Indian land titles were held. However, legislation included a provision allowing the US President to assign individual tracts to individual owners. In 1860, thirty years after the creation of the Reservation, the government moved to allot tracts to individual households, in an effort to force assimilation to European-American practices.

It resulted in the transfer of an estimated total of 93 e6acre km2 from Native American control. Most was sold to individuals or given out free through the Homestead law, or given directly to Indians as individuals. The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 was also part of Americanization policy; it gave full citizenship to all Indians living on reservations. The leading opponent of forced assimilation was John Collier, who directed the federal Office of Indian Affairs from 1933 to 1945, and tried to reverse many of the established policies.|$|E

50|$|The {{aftermath}} of the rebellion caused the Métis to no longer be considered as Canadian aboriginals- they became regarded as their own social group, and were distinct from other aboriginal groups. In order to pacify the Métis resistance further, the Canadian government gave them generous land grants in 1869-70 that was carefully structured to be given <b>in</b> <b>severalty,</b> rather than in common. Red River was now developing its own provincial government that had a political voice and political implications upon Canadian federal government.

In the memorial letter which she wrote to accompany the petition of 1881, she made an earnest plea to Congress to bring Indians into voluntary citizenship by making that to their interest, rather than by the coercion of acts of Congress. In her petition for January, 1882, universal Indian education, lands <b>in</b> <b>severalty</b> and the full rights of citizenship for Indians were addressed. At that date the society had sixteen State committees, all of which she revisited and reorganized as permanent auxiliaries.

The association, the Women's National Indian Association, had branches, officers or helpers in forty States of the Union, and more than twenty missions in Indian tribes originated or established by it since 1884.

50|$|The {{description}} of Astret Canon, a trev or township (villata) of the honour of Denbigh, surveyed in 1334 {{was the time}} of the native Welsh princes.

On the haif-gavell of Monryk ap Canon, e.g. there are no less than sixteen coparceners, of whom eight possess houses. The peculiarity of this system of land tenure consists in the fact that all the tenants of these gavells derive their position on the land from the occupation of the township by their kindred, and have to trace their rights to shares in the original unit. Although the village of Astret Canon was, occupied under the Survey by something like fifty-four male tenants, the majority of whom were settled in houses of their own, it continued to form a unit as well in regard to the payment of tungpound, that is, of the direct land tax and other services and payments, but also in respect of the possession and usage of the soil.

Since this treaty was enacted before the railroads had come and before the finding of gold in the region, few whites had ventured to settle {{in what is now}} Colorado. By the 1860s, {{as a result of the}} Colorado Gold Rush and homesteaders encroaching westward into Indian terrain, relations between U.S. Americans and the Native American people deteriorated. On February 18, 1861, in the Treaty of Fort Wise, several chiefs of Cheyenne and Arapaho agreed with U.S. representatives to cede most of the lands, ten years earlier designated to their tribes, for white settlement, keeping only a fragment of the original reserve, located between Arkansas River and Sand Creek. This new fragment was assigned <b>in</b> <b>severalty</b> to the individual members of the respective tribes with each member receiving 40 acre of land. The United States, by the Fort Wise Treaty, wished to have the Indians settle the new reservation as farmers.

5000|$|Allogan Slagle summarises early {{events in}} the {{introduction}} to his 1993 work, Burning Phoenix: A Study of the Federal Acknowledgment, Reorganization and Survival of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma. He notes that, [...] "In November 1899, the original Keetoowah Society convened in Tahlequah to pass resolutions critical of the Cherokee Council and the Dawes Commission particularly with regard to plans to dispose of to divide and distribute Cherokee land and to create a roll its members without the consent of the Cherokee Nation." [...] They perceived that it was the government's intention to declare any remainder of land not distributed in the allotment, to those enrolled, as a surplus it could sell to non-Native American settlers. Slagle goes on to argue, They challenged amendments to the Constitution, and resolved to enroll with the Dawes group only under protest. The Keetoowahs in convention at Big Tucker Springs on 6 September 1901 decided to enroll with the Dawes Commission led to a final schism between Keetoowah factions. Redbird Smith left the meeting with eleven of his traditionalist supporters to resist enrollment actively, forming the Nighthawk Keetoowahs.Several hundred Keetoowah Indians, including several groups that started out as members of the Keetoowah Society and left with the Nighthawks in 1901, coalesced to form a number of secretive, traditionalist, exclusive factions. Most of these groups started near Gore, Vian, or Proctor, and adjoining areas. These groups were nascent within the Keetoowah Society as early as 1893, and derived from Goingsnake fire or various of the Four Mothers Nation fires. Like the Nighthawks, these groups generally refused until 1910 or later to accept the work of the Dawes Commission.While they fully intended to maintain tribal government and functions regardless of the fate of the Cherokee Nation, the Keetoowahs as a body officially acquiesced under protest to the effect of all the legislative provisions that would dissolve Cherokee Nation's government and allot Cherokee lands. They learned that they could not prevent the 1893 Act, the Dawes Commission enrollment, U. S. citizenship, the Curtis Act and the abolition of tribal courts, the Agreement with the Cherokee Nation of April 1, 1900, the 1906 Act and the virtual political dissolution of the corrupt Cherokee government as of 4 March 1906, presidential approval for all tribal ordinances affecting tribal or individual lands after allotment, and the allotment <b>in</b> <b>severalty</b> condition of being separate of Cherokee lands.

The specific forms that open fields took can, however be explained by some region-specific factors, among which the rules of inheritance were the most important. ...|$|E
