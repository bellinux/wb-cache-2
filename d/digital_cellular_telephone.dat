This study {{sought to}} determine, in vivo, whether {{electromagnetic}} interference (EMI), generated by North American Digital Communications (NADC) /Time Division Multiple Access– 50 -Hz (TDMA- 50) mobile cellular digital telephone model AT&T 6650, disturbs normal implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) operation and to verify these observations in vitro by testing a selection of telephones representing worldwide systems. Methods. The effects of cellular phone interference on the operation of various models of market-released ICDs from a single manufacturer, Medtronic, Inc., were tested. The in vivo clinical test was undertaken in 41 patients using the AT&T 6650 digital telephone with the NADC/TDMA- 50 technology. The in vitro component {{of the study was}} examined twofold: 1) antenna generated far field; and 2) analog/digital cellular telephone near field. Results. None of the ICDs tested in 41 patients were affected by oversensing of the EMI field of the cellular telephones during the in vivo study. Therefore, the binomial upper 95 % confidence limit for the failure rate of 0 % is 7 %. The in vitro antenna-generated field testing showed that telephone modulation frequencies used in the international Global System Mobile and TDMA- 50 cellular telephone technologies did not result in ICD sensing interference at the predicted electric field intensity. The in vitro near field tests were performed using both analog and digital cellular telephones in service, or in the test mode, and indicated no interaction with normal operation. However, the static magnetic field generated by the cellular telephone placed over the ICD at a distance ≤ 0. 5 cm will activate the internal reed switch, resulting in temporary suspension of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation detection. Conclusions. We conclude that TDMA- 50 cellular telephones did not interfere with these types of ICDs. However, we recommend that the patient not carry or place the <b>digital</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>telephone</b> within 15 cm (6 in.) of the ICD...|$|E

At present, most receivers in communication systems adopt the superheterodyne technique. However, superheterodyne receivers have some disadvantages, for example, complex circuitry, {{high power consumption}} {{and the existence of}} an image-frequency signal. Compared to Homodyne receiver, the receiver can eliminate the IF stage and band pass and band reject filters. A Homodyne receiver scheme constructed with an antenna, low noise amplifier (LNA), a local oscillator (LO), a mixer, a phase shifter and filters is shown in Figure 3. 1. The properties of the homodyne receiver is compact circuitry and low power consumption, are desirable for RFIC technology for GSM <b>digital</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>telephone</b> handset. In practice, the homodyne receiver has the following advantages; the compact front-end reduces the interconnection loss between the antenna and circuits; it eliminates the need for conventional circuits and saves printed circuit band space; it is compatible with BPSK, QPSK, FSK, and QAM systems and also applies to beam forming array systems; and is capable of supporting shot range indoor wireless communication such as high-speed digital video signals. In this project, homodyne receivers are implemented based on the active antenna concept. The 50 ? loops across the circular patch antenna will act as a phase shifter. The AIA is designed as IQ Demodulator and the 50 ? loops will provide 90 o phase shift between In-phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) port.

40|$|Consensus {{standardization}} is {{a social}} process in which technical experts from public, private, and non-profit sectors negotiate the direction and shape of technological change. Scholars {{in a variety of}} disciplines have recognized the importance of consensus standards as alternatives to standards that arise through market mechanisms or standards mandated by regulators. Rather than treating the consensus method as some sort of timeless organizational form or ever-present alternative to markets or laws, I argue that consensus standardization is itself a product of history. In the first two chapters, I explain the origins and growth of consensus standards bodies between 1880 and 1930 as a reaction to and critique of the existing political economy of engineering. By considering the standardization process—instead of the internal dynamics of a particular firm or technology—as the primary category of analysis, I am able to emphasize the cooperative relations that sustained the American style of competitive managerial capitalism during the Second Industrial Revolution. In the remaining four chapters, I examine the processes of network architecture and standardization in the creation of four communications networks during the twentieth century: AT&T’s monopoly telephone network, the Internet, <b>digital</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>telephone</b> networks, and the World Wide Web. Each of these four networks embodied critiques—always implicit and frequently explicit—of preceding and competing networks. These critiques, visible both in the technological design of networks {{as well as in the}} institutional design of standard-setting bodies, reflected the political convictions of successive generations of engineers and network architects. The networks described in this dissertation were thus turning points in the century-long development of an organizational form. Seen as part of a common history, they tell the story of how consensus-based institutions became the dominant mode for setting standards in the Third Industrial Revolution, and created the foundational standards of the information infrastructures upon which a newly globalized economy and society—the Network Society—could grow. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Direct-conversion is an {{alternative}} wireless receiver architecture to the well-established superheterodyne, particularly for highly integrated, low-power terminals. Its fundamental ad-vantage is that the received signal is amplified and filtered at baseband rather than at some high intermediate frequency. This means lower current drain in the amplifiers and active filters and a simpler task of image-rejection. There is considerable interest {{to use it in}} <b>digital</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>telephones</b> and miniature radio messaging systems. This paper briefly covers case studies in the use of direct-conversion receivers and transmitters and summarizes some of the key problems in their implementations. Solutions to these problems arise not only from more appropriate circuit design but also from exploiting system characteristics, such as the modulation format in the system. Baseband digital signal processing must be coupled to the analog front-end to make direct-conversion transceivers a practical reality. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Modern <b>digital</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>telephones</b> and {{portable}} computers {{have created a}} new platform for distributed information processing. However, the characteristics of wireless telephone links {{are different from those}} of wireline links. With standard TCP/IP protocols, this can lead to severe performance problems; some are related to the control of the wireless link, some to the cooperation of the wireless link and the fixed network. One possible solution is to split the end-to-end communication path into two parts, and to establish a separate control for each part. The Mowgli communication architecture is a sophisticated elaboration of this basic idea covering several data communication layers. One of its main components is the Mowgli data channel service (MDCS), which transparently replaces the standard TCP/IP core protocols over the slow wireless link. We discuss how the Mowgli approach, using the MDCS, alleviates the problems encountered with TCP/IP protocols over slow wireless links. The results of our performance tests indicate the merits of the Mowgli approach. The transfer times and the response times become more stable, transfer times for multiple parallel bidirectional transfers are substantially reduced, and response times in interactive work can be kept at a low and predictable level, even when there is other traffic on the wireless link.
