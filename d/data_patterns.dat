The overall goal of the data mining process is to extract information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use. Aside from the raw analysis step, it involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.

This paper introduces {{a new approach to}} characterizing kernel malware’s behavior by using kernel <b>data</b> access <b>patterns</b> unique to the malware. The approach neither uses malware’s control flow consisting of temporal ordering of malware code execution, nor the code-specific information about the malware. Thus, the malware signature based on such <b>data</b> access <b>patterns</b> is resilient in matching malware variants. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we first generated the signatures of three classic rootkits using their <b>data</b> access <b>patterns,</b> and then matched them with a group of kernel execution instances which are benign or compromised by 16 kernel rootkits. The malware signatures did not trigger any false positives in benign kernel runs; however, kernel runs compromised by 16 rootkits were detected due to the <b>data</b> access <b>patterns</b> shared with the compared signature(s). We further observed similar <b>data</b> access <b>patterns</b> in the signatures of the tested rootkits and exposed popular rootkit attack operations by ranking common data behavior across rootkits.
