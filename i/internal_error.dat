40|$|When {{designing}} a software module or system, a software engineer needs to consider and differentiate between {{how the system}} handles external and <b>internal</b> <b>errors.</b> External errors must be tolerated by the system, while <b>internal</b> <b>errors</b> should be discovered and eliminated. This paper presents a development strategy based on design contracts to minimize the amount of <b>internal</b> <b>errors</b> in a software system while accommodating external errors. A distinction is made between weak and strong contracts that corresponds to the distinction between external and <b>internal</b> <b>errors.</b> According to the strategy, strong contracts should be applied initially to promote the correctness of the system. Before release, the contracts governing external interfaces should be weakened and error management of external errors enabled. This transformation of a strong contract to a weak one is harmless to client modules. In addition to presenting the strategy, the paper also presents {{a case study of}} an industrial project where this strategy was successfully applied. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this talk}} we {{consider}} an extended failure model for communication software: Instead {{of having to}} handle only external failures like lost or corrupted data packets, invalid routes and crashing nodes, we request the software to also handle <b>internal</b> <b>errors.</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>errors</b> can be the unfaithful execution of some instructions or the partial loss of the code base. We then ask whether software is able to detect such <b>internal</b> <b>errors</b> (self-monitoring), is able to continue operation despite such errors (resilience) {{and is able to}} correct such errors (self-healing). As a first step towards a better understanding of this problem, we restrict our attention to a simple “knock-out ” criteria: The challenge is to demonstrate a program that continues correct execution despite removal of an arbitrary instructions. Having such resilient protocol implementations would permit to distribute the corresponding execution circuits over a network without having to worry about unreliable execution platforms {{in the same way as}} we expect current protocols to handle unreliable communication channels. Reasons to “harden ” Communication Software Resilience and self-healing ability are essential properties of a truly self-organizing network, where functional and coherent protocol structures must emerge out of basic protocol submodules.

5000|$|The R3000 {{and later}} {{microprocessors}} {{had only a}} typical amount of <b>internal</b> <b>error</b> checking, insufficient for Tandem's needs. So the Cyclone/R ran pairs of R3000 processors in lock step, running the same data thread. It used a curious variation of lock stepping. The checker processor ran 1 cycle behind the primary processor. This allowed them to share a single copy of external code and data caches without putting excessive pinout load on the sysbus and lowering the system clock rate. To successfully run microprocessors in lock step, the chips must be designed to be fully deterministic. Any hidden internal state must be cleared by the chip's reset mechanism. Otherwise, the matched chips will sometimes get out of sync for no visible reason and without any faults, long after the chips are restarted. All chip designers agree that these are good principles because it helps them test chips at manufacturing time. But all new microprocessor chips seemed to have bugs in this area, and required months of shared work between MIPS and Tandem to eliminate or work around the final subtle bugs.|$|E

5000|$|Frequently, a RAID {{controller}} is configured to [...] "drop" [...] {{a component}} drive (that is, {{to assume a}} component drive has failed) if the drive has been unresponsive for eight seconds or so; this might cause the array controller to drop a good drive because that drive has not been given enough time to complete its <b>internal</b> <b>error</b> recovery procedure. Consequently, using RAID for consumer-marketed drives can be risky, and so-called [...] "enterprise class" [...] drives limit this error recovery time to reduce risk. Western Digital's desktop drives {{used to have a}} specific fix. A utility called WDTLER.exe limited a drive's error recovery time. The utility enabled TLER (time limited error recovery), which limits the error recovery time to seven seconds. Around September 2009, Western Digital disabled this feature in their desktop drives (e.g. the Caviar Black line), making such drives unsuitable for use in RAID configurations. However, Western Digital enterprise class drives are shipped from the factory with TLER enabled. Similar technologies are used by Seagate, Samsung, and Hitachi. Of course, for non-RAID usage, an enterprise class drive with a short error recovery timeout that cannot be changed is therefore less suitable than a desktop drive. In late 2010, the Smartmontools program began supporting the configuration of ATA Error Recovery Control, allowing the tool to configure many desktop class hard drives for use in RAID setups.|$|E
50|$|Pope Clement V absolved 72 of the Knights Templar in July 1308 at Poitiers {{after hearing}} their confessions. However, King Philip still {{withheld}} {{access to the}} leaders of the Order and it was not until August 1308 that a papal commission finally was allowed to hear from them and also grant them absolution. The evidence of these hearings has been based on indirect evidence until the discovery of the Chinon parchment in September 2001 by Barbara Frale in the Vatican Archives. The document had been previously overlooked by Vatican researchers for some time due to its damaged condition and being misfiled among other unrelated documents. The importance of the Chinon parchment is that it is an authentic copy under the seal of three of the cardinals sent by Clement V, Bérenger Fredoli, Etienne de Suisy and Landolfo Brancacci, who were authorized to judge the Templars in his name. There was another account of the trials at Chinon, namely a second-hand report held in the French Chancery, described in the register of Pierre d'Étampes, which was the only available account up until the discovery of the original parchment (and its authentic copy) in the Vatican archives. A comparison between the two shows the French copy provides a somewhat different account of events at Chinon. The Chinon parchment shows the hearings were held by the Church only and that royal lawyers were not present, while the French document gives a different impression, that the official proceedings were held {{under the auspices of the}} Pope and the French king. Other discrepancies between the two lead to the conclusion that the French document was an indirect copy based on verbal accounts and not from having access to the original parchment. There is one unresolved question as to the chronology, however. In the bull Faciens misericordiam (showing mercy) the Clement V announced to Philip IV that Jacques de Molay and the other Templar leaders were absolved and reconciled to the Church; and that any power to judge them again was reserved to the Pope alone. This bull was dated 12 August 1308, eight days before the hearings with these leaders was actually held. Whether this was an <b>internal</b> <b>error</b> in dating or the Pope was certain of the outcome before the hearings is not known and needs to be investigated further. While it remains less than clear as to what exactly happened at Chinon castle between 17-20 August 1308, further investigations may provide new answers.|$|E

40|$|Errors pose {{a serious}} threat to the output {{validity}} of modern data processing, which is often performed by computer programs. In scientific computation, data are collected through instruments or sensors that may be exposed to rough environmental conditions, leading to errors. Furthermore, during the computation process data may not be precisely represented due to the limited precision of the underlying machine, leading to representation errors. Computational processing of these data may hence produce unreliable output results or even faulty conclusions. We call them reliability problems. ^ We consider the reliability problems that are caused by two kinds of errors. The first kind of errors includes input and parameter errors, which originate from the external physical environment. We call these external errors. The other kind of errors is due to the limited representation of floating-point values. They occur when values cannot be precisely represented by machines. We call them <b>internal</b> representation <b>errors,</b> or <b>internal</b> <b>errors.</b> They are usually at a much smaller scale compared to external errors. Nonetheless, such tiny errors may still lead to unreliable results and serious problems. ^ In this dissertation, we develop program analysis techniques to enable reliable data processing. For external errors, we propose techniques to improve the sampling efficiency of Monte Carlo methods, namely execution coalescing and white-box sampling. For <b>internal</b> <b>errors,</b> we develop efficient monitoring techniques to detect instability problems at runtime in floating point program executions. ...|$|R

5000|$|An <b>internal</b> {{compiler}} <b>error</b> (commonly abbreviated as ICE) is {{an error}} that occurs {{not due to}} erroneous source code, but rather due to a bug in the compiler itself. They can sometimes be worked around by making small, insignificant changes to the source code around the line indicated by the error (if such a line is indicated at all), but sometimes larger changes must be made such as refactoring the code to avoid certain constructs or using a different compiler or different version of the compiler. When an <b>internal</b> compiler <b>error</b> is reached many compilers do not output a standard error, but instead output a shortened version, with additional files attached, that is only for <b>internal</b> compiler <b>errors.</b> This is {{in order to insure}} that the program doesn't crash when logging the error, which would make solving the error nigh impossible.

40|$|Radiocarbon (C- 14) dating {{remains the}} {{predominant}} method to build robust chronologies from peat deposits for paleoclimate reconstruction. Although {{it is widely}} known that the C- 14 content of different chemical fractions in peat varies, this heterogeneity is not fully accounted for while constructing age depth models. Since peat is a complex and heterogeneous matrix, we tried to characterize this uncertainty on our C- 14 dates by experimenting with pre-treatment procedures on peat sampled from a high elevation site in southern India, where reliable and continuous records of paleoenvironments are scarce. Dated to similar to 40 kyr, the Sandynallah peat accumulation in valleys > 2000 m asl in the Nilgiris, Western Ghats, remains {{an important source of}} paleoenvironmental information. We subsampled 2 peat cores (labelled Cores 1 and 2) from this site at 1 cm and 2 cm resolution, respectively, and obtained C- 14 dates using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) for 73 Core 1 and 40 Core 2 samples. The results indicate that the uncertainty (possibly due to sample heterogeneity; henceforth called external error) for each date is at least tenfold the <b>internal</b> <b>error</b> (reported from the AMS). When this external error estimate was included as an added variance to the <b>internal</b> <b>error</b> on the radiocarbon dates, the numerous minor date reversals on deposits up to about 30 kyr were better explained for by the age-depth model than when only the <b>internal</b> <b>error</b> was used. The remaining large date reversals on deposits older than about 30 kyr are consistent with previous studies from the Sandynallah basin and, hence, could correspond to large deposit level changes/fluctuations. Based on these results we argue that using <b>internal</b> <b>error</b> as the total uncertainty associated with a date given by AMS is insufficient, resulting in models of high precision over accuracy. The <b>internal</b> <b>error</b> should be used in conjunction with a reliable estimate of external error in an age-depth model for more realistic dating of paleoclimatic events. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.
