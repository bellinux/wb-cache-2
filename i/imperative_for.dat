5|$|Ahimsa is <b>imperative</b> <b>for</b> {{practitioners}} of Patañjali's eight limb Raja yoga system. It {{is included in}} the first limb and is the first of five Yamas (self restraints) which, together with the second limb, make up the code of ethical conduct in Yoga philosophy. Ahimsa {{is also one of the}} ten Yamas in Hatha Yoga according to verse 1.1.17 of its classic manual Hatha Yoga Pradipika.|$|E
5|$|Communication among North American river otters is {{accomplished}} mainly by olfactory and auditory signals. Scent marking is <b>imperative</b> <b>for</b> intergroup communication.

5|$|Aesthetics as {{a factor}} of well-being. From the early austere {{principle}} that form should strictly follow function, {{there is a growing}} sensibility that aesthetics affect the physical and emotional health of those who use a building or structure. Norwegian laws concerning occupational health have for several decades emphasized access to daylight and fresh air, and it may also be that harsh climatic conditions create an added <b>imperative</b> <b>for</b> uplifting aesthetics.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, {{the second}} edition of the tournament, Blackpool and Bologna were the two nations' best-ranked teams and contested the final at the Stadio Renato Dall'Ara on 12 June 1971. Prior to the match, tournament {{organiser}} Gigi Peronace stressed that it was <b>imperative</b> <b>for</b> an Italian club to win back the trophy. After 90 minutes the score was 1–1 and the match went into extra-time, during which Micky Burns scored the winning goal for Blackpool.|$|E
5|$|In {{her later}} works, such as A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) and A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), Wollstonecraft {{repeatedly}} {{returns to the}} topics addressed in Thoughts, particularly the virtue {{of hard work and}} the <b>imperative</b> <b>for</b> women to learn useful skills. Wollstonecraft suggests that the social and political life of the nation would greatly improve if women were to acquire valuable skills instead of being mere social ornaments.|$|E
5|$|Undeterred, Bruce {{was elected}} Chairman {{of the newly}} formed FAO Council in November 1947, working once more with John Boyd Orr, now Secretary-General of the FAO. Acute {{shortages}} of cereals and livestock were rampant following severe droughts in Europe, and the international food supply system was under serious strain after the devastation of the war. Bruce and the council worked in these years to distribute fertiliser and agricultural machinery, as well as improve nutrition, especially in less developed nations. More {{than two-thirds of the}} world was undernourished in 1949 and Bruce felt it <b>imperative</b> <b>for</b> the Council to bring these stark facts to the developed nations. A landmark agreement on technical aid between the FAO and the United Nations was reached in November 1949, and the FAO received the funding and logistical capacity to act on the food shortage crisis and the problems of poor nutrition in the developing world. Bruce and the FAO were successful in these years in supporting the recovery of world agricultural output. By 1951 this had exceeded pre-war levels, and general levels of nutrition were rising internationally, but by the time Bruce stepped down in that year neither had improved fast enough {{to keep pace with the}} post-war population boom. The Council faced major obstacles in supporting the improvement of conditions in the developing world as governments there began diverting resources to arms programs as independence, post-colonial and Cold War conflicts multiplied. Frustrated by continuing world conflict and the lack of commitment from the developed world to support the lofty but very difficult aims of the FAO, both Bruce and Orr resigned from the FAO disappointed by its modest gains and insufficient powers to alleviate world food problems.|$|E

25|$|While Fackenheim's sentiments {{about the}} need for Jewish {{self-reliance}} {{in the form of a}} Jewish state are immensely popular, Fackenheim fails to locate a religious or divine source for his moral <b>imperative.</b> <b>For</b> Fackenheim, self-defense, and its manifestation in Zionism, are not religious values but rather things that precede religious value or stand outside of it. Thus Fackenheim locates the significance of the Jewish State in the Holocaust rather than in traditional Judaism...|$|E
25|$|While the <b>imperative</b> <b>for</b> {{the line}} was mineral traffic, the Caledonian saw that {{suburban}} passenger traffic was a growth area since the opening of Glasgow Central station in 1879, and the Cathcart lines from 1886. Urban tramway competition (with horse traction at first) was developing as a competitive threat in the city, with which the Caledonian wished to compete. Stations were opened between Neilston and Kirkhill in relatively rural areas as a speculative development.|$|E
25|$|Increase in ghetto living {{has also}} shown a {{strengthening}} of stereotyping {{due to lack of}} cross-cultural interaction, and reduction in economic and educational opportunities at large.

Secularism in India is being seen by some as a favour to the Muslims, and not an <b>imperative</b> <b>for</b> democracy.|$|E

25|$|With the German {{invasion}} {{starting on}} 9 April 1940, the Luftwaffe had initially {{intended to use}} Værnes Air Station as its main stronghold for operating aircraft of the 10th Air Corps in Trøndelag. Contrary to their intelligence statements, Værnes was in a dilapidated state, lacking such amenities as a paved runway. The Luftwaffe therefore looked around for other suitable sites {{to allow them to}} continue battle in the Norwegian Campaign. All supplies would need to be flow in to Trøndelag until 13 April, and it was therefore <b>imperative</b> <b>for</b> the Wehrmacht that an air base be established in the region.|$|E
25|$|The RCN's then current HO4S-3 utility {{helicopter}} could not operate safely in inclement weather {{with a heavy}} weapons and sensor load, which would be <b>imperative</b> <b>for</b> the ASW role; hence, a more capable aircraft was needed. Initial 1959 studies identified two helicopters that seemed suitable - the Sikorsky S-61 (HSS-2) and the Kaman K-20 (HU2K)- but neither aircraft had flown at the time, so no choice was made. After further studies concluded that the smaller Kaman would better satisfy RCN requirements, the Treasury Board approved an initial procurement of 12 HU2K helicopters for $14.5 million in December 1960.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{reaching}} Mushkoh Valley, the 13 JAK Rifles {{was placed}} {{under the command of}} 79 Mountain Brigade. The next assignment for Batra's battalion was to capture the Point 4875, a strategically important peak located in the Mushkoh Valley. Since the feature dominated the National Highway 1 completely from Dras to Matayan, it became <b>imperative</b> <b>for</b> the Indian Army to capture this notorious Point 4875. A stretch of 30–40 kilometres of the national highway was under direct observation of the enemy. From Point 4875, Pakistani artillery observers could easily see Indian gun positions, army camps and troop movement, and bring down effective artillery fire at will.|$|E
