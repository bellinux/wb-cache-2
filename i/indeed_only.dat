5|$|Meanwhile, 5 Platoon was in dire straits and was {{beginning}} to run low of ammunition, while a number of its M60 machine-guns were also beginning to fail because of the prolonged firing. Moving to outflank the heavily outnumbered Australians, Viet Cong were observed emerging from their bunkers. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>only</b> heavy indirect fire and effective suppressing fire from helicopter gunships prevented them from being overrun. Attempting {{to gain a better}} position to direct the fire, the B Company Forward Observer, Lieutenant Ian Mathers, moved forward to 5 Platoon, and was killed almost immediately. However, by 09:15 the remainder of B Company was able to link up with the beleaguered platoon, and after an aerial resupply of ammunition, stabilised the situation temporarily.|$|E
5|$|Grove {{started the}} 1944 season with an {{interesting}} honor: {{he was assigned}} to the 4-F All-Star team, a group of 25 major league players who were the best of those exempt from military service. Grove was given the job of being the Opening Day starting pitcher for the White Sox. He pitched {{the first game of the}} season against the Cleveland Indians and their starting pitcher, Al Smith, on April 19, 1944, and won 3–1. Grove also managed to shut out the Yankees on May 18; it was the first time the Yankees had not scored a run in 1944. By mid-season, Grove had seven wins, six losses, five complete games, and a 3.40 ERA. Because of these statistics, he was selected to the American League All-Star team, his first and only career appearance. Five American League pitchers pitched in the All-Star Game on July 11, although Grove was one of the four on the roster who did not; therefore, his lone All-Star appearance was <b>indeed</b> <b>only</b> an appearance. During the second half of the season, Grove performed well at Comiskey Park, but struggled on the road, at one point losing five straight games despite good run support from the White Sox. Grove finished the season with 14 wins, 15 losses, an ERA of 3.72, two shutouts, and a career best of nearly 235 innings pitched.|$|E

25|$|Born in Cape Town, Cowper {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut in January 1908, playing for Western Province against Natal at Cape Town's Newlands ground. The Currie Cup was only contested irregularly at that stage, and, with a South African representative side touring England at the time, the 1907–08 season saw very little cricket played – <b>indeed,</b> <b>only</b> two first-class matches, both between Western Province and Natal, were played {{throughout the whole}} season. Cowper's debut came {{in the first of}} these matches. A left-arm medium-pacer, he bowled only five overs on debut, taking 1/21 in Natal's second innings as Western Province won by three wickets. James Whitehead (match figures of 10/83) and Paddy Carolin (6/67) took 16 wickets between them for Western Province.|$|E

Aftab's only {{recorded}} match at any level came during that season's edition of the Ayub Trophy, contested between a combination of teams from cities, government departments, and universities. In the match, played against Hyderabad in November 1964 at the National Stadium, Karachi, he opened the batting alongside Aqil Shah in each innings. Aftab scored 43 runs in the first innings and 60 runs in the second innings, thus finishing with a career batting average of 51.50. That match {{was to be the}} team's only match of the competition, and <b>indeed</b> <b>only</b> match at first-class level. Aftab did not play any further matches at a major level.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of wood construction {{to a more}} refined level occurred, however, {{in the construction of}} churches. The earliest examples were not designed by architects but rather by master builders, who also were responsible for their construction. One of the oldest known wooden church is that of Santamala, in Nousiainen (only archaeological remains existing), dating from the 12th century, with a simple rectangular ground plan of 11,5 x 15 metres. The oldest preserved wooden churches in Finland date back to the 17th century (e.g. Sodankylä old church, Lapland, 1689); none of the medieval churches are remaining as, like all wooden buildings, they were susceptible to fire. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>only</b> 16 wooden churches from the 17th century still exist - though it was not uncommon to demolish a wooden church {{to make way for a}} larger stone one.|$|E
25|$|The {{prisoners are}} {{assigned}} numbers for easy identification {{and in an}} effort to dehumanize them; Ivan Denisovich's prisoner number is Щ-854. Each day, the squad leader receives their work assignment for that day, and the squad are then fed according to how they perform. Prisoners in each squad are thus forced to work together and pressure each other to get their task done. If any prisoner is slacking, the whole squad will be punished. Despite this, Solzhenitsyn shows that a surprising loyalty exists among the work gang members, with Shukhov teaming up with other prisoners to steal felt and extra bowls of porridge; even the squad leader defies the authorities by tar-papering over the empty windows at their work site. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>only</b> through such solidarity can the prisoners do anything more than survive from day to day.|$|E

25|$|The {{series has}} a number of {{parallels}} with long-running BBC comedy Only Fools and Horses, with both being set in London and involving lovable dodgy dealers with endless get-rich-quick schemes that invariably backfire and get them into trouble (and both of whom tried to make out to be of a higher status than they really were), and both having a blend of comedy and drama. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>Only</b> Fools and Horses creator / writer John Sullivan claimed that one of the ways he persuaded the BBC to commission the series was by pointing to the success of ITV's Minder, which had begun the previous year. After both having lukewarm starts, both series went on to become huge hits, and share much of the same fan base. At Christmas 1985, specials of Only Fools and Horses and Minder were scheduled against each other, angering many viewers (in the days before video recorders were commonplace in many UK homes).|$|E
500|$|Olith a {{daughter}} of Malcolm, married Sigurd Hlodvisson, Earl of Orkney. Their son Thorfinn Sigurdsson {{was said to be}} five years old when Sigurd was killed on 23 April 1014 in the Battle of Clontarf. The Orkneyinga Saga says that Thorfinn was raised at Malcolm's court and was given the Mormaerdom of Caithness by his grandfather. Thorfinn says in the Heimskringla that he was the ally of the king of Scots, and counted on Malcolm's support to resist the [...] "tyranny" [...] of Norwegian King Olaf Haraldsson. (Thorfinn's older step brother had died while a hostage to King Olaf.) The chronology of Thorfinn's life is problematic, and he may have had a share in the Earldom of Orkney while still a child, if he was <b>indeed</b> <b>only</b> five in 1014. Whatever the exact chronology, before Malcolm's death a client of the king of Scots was in control of Caithness and Orkney, although, as with all such relationships, it is unlikely to have lasted beyond his death.|$|E

At the time of airing there were <b>indeed</b> <b>only</b> two female senators: Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. Then-President George H. W. Bush is featured briefly in the episode. Shortly after it aired, Bush disparaged The Simpsons in a speech during his re-election campaign on January 27, 1992. At that point family values were the cornerstone of Bush's campaign platform, so he gave the following speech at the National Religious Broadcasters' convention in Washington: [...] "We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons." [...] As a result, Bush appeared in future episodes in a more negative light.|$|E
