40|$|As {{the world}} {{moves to a}} {{situation}} of increasing globalization, cooperative education has experienced growth in demand for international placements. However, this globalization of cooperative education has not been accompanied by research to support the outcomes of such growth.

The research findings found similarities in this exchange between non-Western and Western countries, with other <b>exchange</b> <b>arrangements</b> between two Western countries.

The findings reported here provide placement coordinators with an understanding of some of the challenges students face in a country different to their homeland and we conclude with recommendations to smooth this sometimes difficult transition...|$|E

The paper concludes with some policy implications for an <b>exchange</b> rate <b>arrangement</b> in East Asia. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} de facto <b>exchange</b> rate <b>arrangements</b> in eight East Asian {{countries}} during the post-Asian crisis period. The empirical results suggest that three countries adopted a hard peg or a peg with capital account restrictions, whereas five countries moved toward a more flexible <b>exchange</b> rate <b>arrangement</b> in the post-crisis period. Three of these five countries (Korea, Indonesia and Thailand) achieved a level of exchange rate flexibility close to the level accomplished in a free floater such as Australia. These results suggest that 'fear of floating' in East Asia is not prevalent in the post-crisis period, supporting the bipolar view of the optimal exchange rate regime. Copyright 2009 The Authors.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the evolution of}} <b>exchange</b> rate <b>arrangements</b> in East Asia’s emerging market economies over the last 10 years. It considers both “official ” and “observed ” <b>exchange</b> rate <b>arrangements</b> in these economies from an international comparative perspective. By focusing on {{the roles of the}} dollar, the yen, and the euro as anchor currencies for exchange rate stabilization, the paper claims that the dollar played a dominant role as a de jure or de facto anchor for emerging East Asia until the 1997 – 98 currency crisis. During the crisis, the dollar’s dominance naturally declined in affected East Asia {{as a result of a}} general shift to more flexible <b>exchange</b> rate <b>arrangements.</b> In the post-crisis period, the dollar has regained prominence in some countries (notably in Malaysia), while its dominance has been reduced and exchange rate flexibility has risen in others (notably in Indonesia). Interesting is the observation that Korea and Thailand appear to have shifted to a de facto currency basket arrangement with significant weights on the dollar and the yen, similar to Singapore’s managed floating arrangement.
