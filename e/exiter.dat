40|$|This {{research}} identifies and {{explores the}} emotions {{of women who are}} exiting (leaving) prostitution. In both the prostitution and desistance literature, emotional factors clearly emerge as {{part of the process of}} change for exiters and desisters; however, there has been very little direct focus on their importance and impact on this process. The research makes a unique contribution to the desistance literature by mapping the process of change for women with particularly complex and challenging circumstances and focusing on the emotional aspects of this change. Overall, the research confirms that understanding the emotional aspects of exit offers new insights and gives rise to a new approach to service provision. The findings reveal that emotions are central to desistance and that role transition is a prerequisite for desistance. The data has shown that exit is a process of self-determination, becoming one’s authentic self, and that this process is bound up with emotional drivers and barriers. The process of exit necessarily involves fostering positive emotional experiences through both external and internal changes. The data suggests that an understanding of dominant emotional constructs at any given time will give a gateway into how best to respond to the needs and motivations of the <b>exiter</b> through service provision and offers an emotionally intelligent model to meet these needs. Service provision plays a key role in bridging the change in lifestyle of exiters through generating emotional energy, increasing access to alternatives, fostering hope, and enabling women to reimagine their lives...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the quality of transition components of the IEPs of 28 high school graduates with disabilities, their projected postsecondary outcomes and levels of satisfaction with these outcomes, and the correspondence between projected and actual outcomes. Results indicated that, although {{the quality of the}} transition com-ponents was not exemplary, some of the outcomes for the students were quite positive. Examination of correspondence between the projected and actual outcomes showed that the greatest number of matches was in the area of employment. Results suggest that a comprehensive transition pro-gram is a critical ingredient for fostering post-school success. The “ultimate test ” of any effec-tive high school transition pro-gram is the progress and suc-cess achieved by its graduates (McAfee & Greenawalt, 2001). Recent studies document that post-school outcomes for stu-dents with disabilities are im-proving (Blackorby & Wagner, 1996); however, outcomes for students with disabilities con-tinue to lag behind those of graduates without disabilities. For example, employment rates and levels of educational attain-ment among school <b>exiters</b> with disabilities remain lower than youth in the general population (Blackorby & Wagner, 1996). Therefore, most researchers and educators still consider the current outcomes of special education graduates as unac-ceptable (Baer et al., 2003; Colley & Jamison, 1998).

The impact of Hurricane Mitch on land holdings is also considered for its contribution to changes in the structure of land ownership and the pace of land market activity.

Moreover, for immigrants, entries on the territory have a large negative effect on the evolution of the homeownership rate. Although entrants have a better education than stayers, they are younger and thus at an earlier stage of the wealth accumulation process.

Using new large-scale, integrated employer-employee data containing information on 68 million individuals and 3. 6 million firms, we explain a very large proportion (84 %) of the total variation in wages rates and attribute substantial variation to both individual and employer heterogeneity. While the wage distribution remained largely unchanged between 1992 - 1997, we document a pronounced right shift in the overall distribution of human capital. Most workers entering our sample, while less experienced, were otherwise more highly skilled, a difference which can be attributed almost exclusively to unobservables. Nevertheless, compared to <b>exiters</b> and continuers, entrants exhibited a greater tendency to match to firms paying below average internal wages. Firms reduced employment shares of low skilled workers and increased employment shares of high skilled workers in virtually every industry. Our results strongly suggest that the distribution of human capital will continue to shift to the right, implying a continuing up-skilling of the employed labor force. human capital, employer-employee data...|$|R
40|$|Malaysia’s {{economic}} success is {{to a significant}} extent underpinned by its export-oriented manufacturing sector. The sector has a large foreign presence, with MNCs attracted by the open trade and investment regime, and FDI-friendly policies. Using unpublished manufacturing census data for 2000 and 2005, we apply the methodology by Foster et al. (1998) to decompose productivity growth. The analysis shows that exporters were more productive than domestic-oriented establishments, and were distinctly more competitive. The empirical evidence also shows that establishment turnover is important in boosting productivity growth. In particular, we find that turnover of exporters made a larger contribution to aggregate productivity growth compared to domestic-oriented establishments {{during the period from}} 2000 to 2005. Surviving establishments (those that operated in both years), on the other hand, made a negative contribution. It is noteworthy that entrants to export markets were more productive than surviving non-exporters and even surviving exporters. <b>Exiters</b> from export markets or “export failures”, on the other hand, were less productive than continuing exporters. Given the importance of turnover to productivity growth, the government should ensure unrestricted entry to the export sectors for both foreign and domestic investors.

Our test relies on a measure of divergence {{in the space of}} density distributions that allows us to assess whether or not the density distribution of bilateral distances between all pairs of plants within an industry significantly departs from randomness.

A detailed review {{of the economic and}} historical literature on productivity growth in Indonesian manufacturing follows. This allows constructing a new methodology for the estimation of aggregate TFP growth in Indonesian manufacturing, using a panel dataset of establishments over the period 1975 - 95. New estimates are presented and compared with historical evidence. Chapter 3 further emphasises the issue of establishments' heterogeneity by presenting a meticulous review of both the theoretical and empirical literature on industrial demography. Chapter 4 investigates further the heterogeneity of manufacturing establishments in terms of productivity, and size. It offers a comprehensive demographic study of manufacturing establishments over the 21 -year period, focusing on productivity and size differentials, as well as on establishments' entry and exit. In a second part, relaxing the representative plant hypothesis and taking establishments' turnover effect into account, I present several decompositions of aggregate TFP growth into incumbents' contribution and the contribution of entrants and <b>exiters.</b> Chapter 5 draws on this literature and tests econometrically the different hypotheses aiming at an explanation of establishments' productivity heterogeneity.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the productivity of}} firms in manufacturing and business services, particularly the contribution of entry and exit to aggregate productivity growth. Abstract Competitive markets foster the reallocation of inputs where resources are channelled from less competitive to more competitive firms, and hence increase aggregate productivity. The turnover of firms entering and exiting industries {{is part of this}} competitive process as entrants vie for market shares and <b>exiters</b> cease consuming inputs. There is a large body of theoretical and empirical work on firm dynamics, yet to date very few large scale studies have been conducted in Australia due to limited access to firm-level data. This study uses a large panel of businesses, drawn from administrative data provided to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), which allows us to track firms over the nine years from 2002 – 03 to 2010 – 11. Using this comprehensive panel we examine the productivity of firms in manufacturing and business services and, in particular measure the contribution of entry and exit to aggregate productivity growth. We find that exiting firms not only have low productivity relative to established firms in the year prior to exit, but the productivity gap is observed many years before they depart the market. Entrants grow most rapidly in their second year of operation, but after five years are still ten per cent below the productivity level of established firms. At the division level, the main driver of productivity growth is continuing firms, and the net impact of firm turnover is relatively modest. However, among the studied industries, net entry can be significant – a fact masked by the higher level of aggregation. Over the nine year period, entry lowered aggregate productivity growth by 13 per cent in manufacturing and 23 per cent in business services as entrants were less productive than continuing firms. In contrast, exiting firms raised productivity by 12 per cent in manufacturing, and 23 per cent in business services...|$|R
