25|$|In early 1996, he was {{contacted}} by Sonic Youth's Steve Shelley, who informed Van Zandt {{that he was}} interested in recording and releasing an album for him on the band's Ecstatic Peace label, funded by Geffen. Van Zandt agreed, and sessions were scheduled to begin in Memphis during late December of that year. On December 19 or 20, Van Zandt fell down the concrete stairs outside his home, badly injuring his hip. After lying outside for an hour, he dragged himself inside and called his ex-wife Jeanene, who sent friends Royann and Jim Calvin to check on him. He told the couple that he had sustained the injury while <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed,</b> and refused medical treatment. They took him back to their home, and he spent the Christmas week on their couch, unable to get up even to use the bathroom.|$|E

500|$|When plantar {{fasciitis}} occurs, {{the pain}} is typically sharp and usually unilateral (70% of cases). Heel pain is worsened by bearing weight on the heel after long periods of rest. Individuals with plantar fasciitis often report their symptoms are most intense during their first steps after <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> or after prolonged periods of sitting. Improvement of symptoms is usually seen with continued walking. [...] Rare, but reported symptoms include [...] numbness, tingling, swelling, or radiating pain. Typically there are no fevers or night sweats.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Hilson as she comes {{home to her}} {{apartment}} and starts playing [...] "Make Love" [...] on a rough cut CD of In a Perfect World... After taking off her jacket, she {{sits down on the}} couch in the living room. In another room, West is seen <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed.</b> Hilson leaves for the kitchen where she puts out champagne and chocolate-dipped strawberries. She then gets ready in the bathroom while West waits in the bedroom. When Hilson is finished, she joins him in bed and they start cuddling and kissing. The video ends with Hilson looking into the camera over West's shoulder.|$|E
500|$|The Soviet {{government}} prevented Pechersky from testifying at the Eichmann Trial in Israel, only {{allowing a}} short deposition in Moscow which {{was controlled by}} the KGB. In 1963, he appeared as a witness during the Soviet trial of 11 former Ukrainian guards at Sobibor; {{all of whom were}} convicted and 10 of whom were executed. According to his daughter in an interview, Pechersky was prevented by the Soviet Union government from testifying in multiple international trials related to Sobibor. The final time Pechersky was refused permission to leave the country and testify was in 1987 for a trial in Poland, and according to his daughter, this refusal [...] "just crippled my father. He almost stopped <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> and instantly aged." ...|$|E

500|$|Louise was {{determined}} to be seen as an ordinary person and not {{as a member of the}} court. When travelling abroad, she often used the alias [...] "Mrs Campbell". Louise was known for her charity towards servants. On one occasion, the butler approached her and requested permission to dismiss the second footman, who was late <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed.</b> When she advised that the footman be given an alarm clock, the butler informed her that he already had one. She then went so far as to suggest a bed that would throw him out at a specified time, but she was told this was not feasible. Finally, she suggested that he might be ill, and when checked, he was found to be suffering from tuberculosis. The footman was therefore sent to New Zealand to recover.|$|E
500|$|Sleep hygiene is the {{recommended}} behavioral and environmental practice that {{is intended to}} promote better quality sleep. This recommendation {{was developed in the}} late 1970s as a method to help people with mild to moderate insomnia, but, , the evidence for effectiveness of individual recommendations is [...] "limited and inconclusive". [...] Clinicians assess the sleep hygiene of people who present with insomnia and other conditions, such as depression, and offer recommendations based on the assessment. [...] Sleep hygiene recommendations include establishing a regular sleep schedule, using naps with care, not exercising physically or mentally too close to bedtime, limiting worry, limiting exposure to light in the hours before sleep, <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> if sleep does not come, not using bed for anything but sleep and sex, avoiding alcohol as well as nicotine, caffeine, and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime, and having a peaceful, comfortable and dark sleep environment.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Shakira <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> {{in the middle}} of a full-moon night. Her nails begin to grow and she is shown lacing a pair of boots. Shakira then enters a closet, which leads to the inside of a {{glittering}} ruby-red cave, where she begins dancing wearing a black asymmetric bodysuit. The next scene depicts Shakira striking different poses inside a golden cage (with the sign [...] "Do Not Feed the Animal" [...] on top), clad in a skin-toned leotard. Shakira explained the usage of the golden cage in the video, saying that [...] "I just wanted to express what it feels like for a she-wolf to be in captivity. To be in a golden cage. I think I've been in a golden cage most of my life. And now not anymore". The setting changes and Shakira is seen performing a dance routine in a club with many back-up dancers. A wolf is also shown walking in the club and transforming into a woman. Near to the end of the video, Shakira dances on a rooftop with a backdrop resembling San Francisco. As the song ends, she falls backwards from the roof and lands in her closet. The video ends with Shakira lying back in her bed and smiling as thunder cracks.|$|E

5000|$|Belief logic symbols, when {{combined}} with imperative logic, allow beliefs and desires to be expressed. The notation [...] is used for beliefs ("You believe A") and [...] for desires ("You desire A"). In formal ethics, desire is taken in a strong sense when the agent of the belief {{is the same as}} the agent of the imperative. The following table shows the different interpretations for [...] depending on the agent and the tense of the imperative:This strong interpretation of desires precludes statements such as [...] "I want to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> (right now), but I don't act to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed". It does not, however, preclude [...] "I want to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> (right now), but I don't <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed".

2500|$|In 1974, David Bowie {{released}} the album Diamond Dogs. It {{is thought to}} be loosely based on the novel 1984. It includes the tracks [...] "We Are The Dead", [...] "1984" [...] and [...] "Big Brother". Before the album was made, Bowie's management (MainMan) had planned for Bowie and Tony Ingrassia (MainMan's creative consultant) to co-write and direct a musical production of Orwell's 1984, but apparently, Bowie loathed doing anything on assignment and showed his disinterest by not <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> to work on the project. Orwell's widow was appalled at the idea and refused to give MainMan the rights.|$|E
2500|$|Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) – The {{most common}} cause of vertigo. [...] It is {{typically}} described as a brief, intense sensation of spinning that occurs when there are changes in the position of the head with respect to gravity. An individual may experience BPPV when rolling over to the left or right, upon <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> in the morning, or when looking up for an object on a high shelf. The cause of BPPV is the presence of normal but misplaced calcium crystals called otoconia, which are normally found in the utricle and saccule (the otolith organs) and are used to sense movement. If they fall from the utricle and become loose in the semicircular canals, they can distort the sense of movement and cause a mismatch between actual head movement and the information sent to the brain by the inner ear, causing a spinning sensation.|$|E
2500|$|Vertov says in {{his essay}} [...] "The Man with a Movie Camera" [...] that he was {{fighting}} [...] "for a decisive cleaning up of film-language, for its complete separation from the language of theater and literature." [...] By the later segments of Kino-Pravda, Vertov was experimenting heavily, looking to abandon what he considered film clichés (and receiving criticism for it); his experimentation was even more pronounced and dramatic {{by the time of}} Man with a Movie Camera, which was filmed in Ukraine. Some have criticized the obvious stagings in this film as being at odds with Vertov's credos of [...] "life as it is" [...] and [...] "life caught unawares": the scene of the woman <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> and getting dressed is obviously staged, as is the reversed shot of the chess pieces being pushed off a chess board and the tracking shot which films Mikhail Kaufman riding in a car filming a third car.|$|E

2500|$|The next to be {{executed}} was Erskine Childers, who had been secretary to the Anglo-Irish Treaty negotiations. Childers was a well-known Republican - it was on his boat, the Asgard, that the guns had been brought in during the Howth gun-running - he was a renowned columnist, novelist, {{and a member of}} the Anglo-Irish, Protestant landowning family of Glendalough House, Annamoe, County Wicklow. He had been captured on 10 November in possession of a Spanish-made [...]32-calibre pocket pistol which Collins had given to him. - or as Charles Gavan Duffy described the circumstances to the Dáil four days after Childers was shot, [...] "The military authorities apparently ascertained that Erskine Childers was living at the home of his childhood in Wicklow; they surrounded the house in the early morning; they found him there and arrested him, as I understand, <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> with a revolver." [...] Childers and eight others appealed to the civilian judiciary. The Master of the Rolls considered whether a state of war existed. He considered the existence of a Provisional Government in Ireland and its authority to act as proposed and execute the nine.|$|E
2500|$|The sleeper serves {{mainly to}} keep the wearer warm at night, {{even in the absence}} of {{blankets}} and bed covers. [...] The sleeper covers the entire body except for the head (except in certain cases where a hood is present) and (in most cases) hands (except in cases where a sleeper has attached mitts, mostly on infant sizes), where it is snug at the neck and wrists. [...] The use of a zipper closure in place of buttons or snap fasteners also further retains warmth by eliminating drafts. [...] This is especially important for infants, for whom loose blankets may pose a safety hazard (including increasing the risk of SIDS), and possibly for older children, who may still be too young to be relied upon {{to keep the}}ir own sleepwear or bed covers adjusted so as to prevent exposure to the air of bare skin. [...] This is reflected in advertisements by blanket sleeper manufacturers, which often emphasize that their garments [...] "can't be kicked off", or that [...] "no other covers are needed". The permanently attached feet can also be a beneficial feature for children who are prone to get out of bed in the morning before their parents are awake, and are too young to be relied upon to put on slippers or other footwear to keep their feet warm, as well as for adults who find putting on, and/or wearing socks in bed too bothersome, yet still want their feet covered when <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> in the morning. [...] Blanket sleepers without feet allow more room for growth and reduce the possibility of slipping. [...] Also, children with larger or smaller feet find a better fit.|$|E
