40|$|Ownership {{structure}} {{is known as}} the distribution of equity with relation to votes, capital and the identity of equity owners (Holderness et al., 1999). Ownership structure served as an important element in corporate governance by influencing the type of incentives managers receives from the firm. This paper reviews recent studies on the effect of ownership structure on banking efficiency in the developing countries with the focus on ASEAN countries. Review of previous studies clearly indicates that types of ownerships did exert some influences towards the performance of the banks in terms of efficiency. Even though publicly-owned banks operated in an economically inefficiency environment, it is undeniable that the existence of publicly-owned banks are needed especially in economically less stable countries. This is because the government-owned banks or the state-owned banks can act as a catalyst to ensure the development of certain priority sectors that are believed to contribute to the long run economic growth of the countries. Besides that, the existence of state-owned banks and government-ownership is crucial for the countries to have a balance social and economic objective. In addition, countries need to encourage the entry for foreign participants into the banking sectors to improve the quality and availability of the financial services towards the domestic financial market (Levine, 1996). The entry will encourage domestic banks to compete more efficiently in terms of costs and profits in order to survive in this environment. The spillover effects in terms of technology brought by the <b>foreign</b> <b>participant</b> will enable the creation of a more modern banking environment in the host countries. Not only that, with a balance combination of state-, privately-, and foreign-owned banks, it is believed that the banking industry in the developing countries will be able to survive in the competitive environment while helping the government effectively implement the macroeconomics policies in the long run...|$|E

30|$|When {{the results}} of the {{multiple}} regression analysis were investigated, it was observed that nationality had a negative coefficient in the regression equation. A variance test was performed for general landscape preferences by taking nationality as a dependent factor. The results showed that Japanese participants had significantly lower preference ratings (3.35) than <b>foreign</b> <b>participants</b> (4.22) (F[*]=[*] 30.095, df[*]=[*] 1 – 127, p[*]<[*] 0.001). To examine the effect of nationality on general landscape preferences, the dataset was split into two distinct subsets in which one of them contained only Japanese subjects’ preferences, while the other one contained only foreign subjects’ preferences. Based on this division, {{the results of}} the analysis showed that <b>foreign</b> <b>participants</b> had significantly different mean preference scores for different observation points (F[*]=[*] 3.297, df[*]=[*] 7 – 56, p[*]≤[*] 0.005), while this significance level was lower for Japanese participants (F[*]=[*] 2.545, df[*]=[*] 7 – 57, p[*]<[*] 0.05). For Japanese respondents, Mt. Fujimi (4.00) and Nakanohashi- 1 (4.00) were the most preferred sites, while foreign respondents liked Mt. Hakkei (4.86) the most. Additionally, the site called ‘next to Tsubame-no-ochaya’ (2.88) was the least preferred by Japanese <b>participants,</b> whereas for <b>foreign</b> <b>participants,</b> ‘the forest area surrounding Dai-sensui’ (3.71) was the least preferred site. Moreover, Japanese visitors preferred ‘shakkei points’ (3.68) to the ‘non-shakkei points’ (3.22), but the difference was not significant (F[*]=[*] 2.566, df[*]=[*] 1 – 63, p[*]>[*] 0.05), whereas foreign visitors significantly preferred the ‘shakkei points’ (4.64) to the others (4.10) (F[*]=[*] 8.427, df[*]=[*] 1 – 62, p[*]≤[*] 0.005). Furthermore, when the effect of the predefined categories of observation points on general landscape preferences was investigated separately for Japanese and <b>foreign</b> <b>participants,</b> a dramatic difference was observed between the two groups. According to {{the results of the}} analysis, foreign respondents significantly preferred the open-protected observation points (4.64) the most and closed-protected observation points (3.80) the least (F[*]=[*] 6.859, df[*]=[*] 3 – 60, p[*]<[*] 0.001), and this result was consistent with the main dataset (see the section on the effect of prospect–refuge on general landscape preferences). However, this situation was different for Japanese respondents, as they significantly preferred the open-unprotected observation points (3.87) the most and closed-protected observation points (2.88) the least (F[*]=[*] 4.009, df[*]=[*] 3 – 61, p[*]<[*] 0.05). Another difference between Japanese and <b>foreign</b> <b>participants</b> was found for the correlation between the building ratio and general landscape preferences. In the foreign respondent data, no correlation was found between the building ratio and general landscape preferences (r[*]=[*]−[*] 0.053, p[*]>[*] 0.5), and the relationship between them was negative, as expected. On the other hand, Japanese respondent data showed a positive and significant correlation between building ratio and general landscape preferences (r[*]=[*] 0.257, p[*]<[*] 0.05).|$|R
