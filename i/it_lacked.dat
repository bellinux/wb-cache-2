5|$|Since Johor {{could not}} have ceded Singapore island and the islets in its {{vicinity}} to the British if <b>it</b> <b>lacked</b> title to them, this was evidence that the United Kingdom recognised the prior and continuing sovereignty of the Johor Sultanate over all islands {{in and around the}} Singapore Strait.|$|E
5|$|There was a Japanese {{nuclear weapon}} program, but <b>it</b> <b>lacked</b> the human, mineral and {{financial}} resources of the Manhattan Project, and never made much progress towards developing an atomic bomb.|$|E
5|$|A {{draft design}} was {{completed}} without foreign assistance by the Construction Department on 11 July 1939, {{but it did}} not reflect the numerous technical developments that had entered capital ship designs after the First World War. In particular, its armor scheme was utterly obsolete, as <b>it</b> <b>lacked</b> any substantial amount of deck armor or good underwater protection; it came closer to the designs of 20 to 25years previous than to that of a modern warship.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not believe}} that it is suited for elephants. <b>It</b> <b>lacks</b> energy, <b>it</b> <b>lacks</b> force of character, <b>it</b> <b>lacks</b> bitterness. These things all show in the meekness and {{resignation}} of its expression. It would not attack an elephant, I am sure of it. It might not run if it saw one coming, but it looked to me like a dog that would sit down and pray.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>lacks</b> verse Acts 8:37.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>lacks</b> Pericope Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11).|$|R
5|$|All three {{ships were}} {{fitted with a}} shallow anti-torpedo bulge {{integral}} to the hull which was intended to explode the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and vent the underwater explosion to the surface rather than into the ship. However, later testing proved {{that it was not}} deep enough to accomplish its task as <b>it</b> <b>lacked</b> the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force of the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{development}} of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, partly because <b>it</b> <b>lacked</b> coal and iron resources and partly because {{of the impact of the}} sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England, which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was generally positive. Although critics felt that <b>it</b> <b>lacked</b> a classic single and considered it a minor letdown compared to Body Talk Pt. 1, it received praise for being solid and club-ready. In Sweden, the album {{reached the top of}} the Sverigetopplistan chart. It also reached number one in Denmark and number three in Norway. In the United States, it peaked at number forty-one, becoming Robyn's highest position on the chart.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>lacks</b> text of Matthew 18:11.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>lacks</b> {{the text}} of the Matthew 16:2b-3, but it was added by a later hand at the margin. <b>It</b> <b>lacks</b> text of the Christ's agony at Gethsemane (Luke 22:43-44). The text of the Pericope Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11) is {{relocated}} and placed after Luke 21:38.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>lacks</b> the Pericope Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11).|$|R
5|$|During {{the colonial}} period, present-day Argentina offered fewer {{economic}} advantages {{compared to other}} parts of the Spanish Empire such as Mexico or Peru, which caused it to assume a peripheral position within the Spanish colonial economy. <b>It</b> <b>lacked</b> deposits of gold or other precious metals, nor did it have established native civilizations to subject to the encomienda.|$|E
5|$|Ground {{operations}} in Normandy were controlled by Montgomery at first, but SHAEF Forward headquarters moved to Jullouville in August, and on 1 September Eisenhower assumed control of Bradley's 12th Army Group and Montgomery's 21st Army Group. Smith {{soon realized that}} he had made a mistake. The forward headquarters was remote and inaccessible, and <b>it</b> <b>lacked</b> the necessary communications equipment.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Charles Horton Peck {{described}} the variety magna from material collected in North Elba, New York. Peck {{explained that the}} variety differed from the typical species in several ways: var. magna grew among fallen leaves under balsam fir trees, or among mosses on the ground, not on buried wood; <b>it</b> <b>lacked</b> a stem, and was instead broad and rounded underneath; its hymenium was more yellow-brown then the nominate variety; and, its spore were slightly longer.|$|E

5000|$|The mer {{software}} distribution is a middleware: <b>it</b> <b>lacks</b> the Linux kernel and <b>it</b> also <b>lacks</b> a UI. Mer is targeted at hardware vendors' mobile-oriented operating systems.|$|R
5|$|M34 Prime Mover â€“ M34 Prime Movers {{were simply}} M32B1 Recovery Vehicles without the towing cable and were just used for pulling towed {{artillery}} into place. It was typically reserved for pulling heavy artillery, {{such as the}} 240mm howitzer. <b>It</b> <b>lacked</b> any armament and had four seats for crew. The vehicle also had tail lights, electric outlets for stopping of towed loads, and multiple stowage ports. Production started in 1944 and ended in 1945.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 1942, the (Japanese) Imperial Navy had {{the better}} ships {{and the better}} tactics. After November15, 1942, its leaders lost heart and <b>it</b> <b>lacked</b> the {{strategic}} depth to face the burgeoning U.S. Navy and its vastly improving weapons and tactics. The Japanese never got better while, after November 1942, the U.S. Navy never stopped getting better.|$|E
5|$|Satisfied {{with his}} support for single-payer health care and his efforts to close Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant, the Vermont Progressive Party had not run a {{candidate}} against Shumlin in 2010 or 2012. Its members discussed challenging him in 2014 because of his proposed cuts to social programs, but the party openly admitted that <b>it</b> <b>lacked</b> the money for a gubernatorial campaign, and no candidate came forward to run.|$|E

5|$|Taare Zameen Par was {{initially}} acclaimed as India's official entry for the 2009 Academy Awards Best Foreign Film, but after {{it failed to}} progress to the short list, a debate began in the Indian media as to why Indian films never win Academy Awards. Speculation for the reasons behind Taare Zameen Pars failed bid included Rediff.com's Arthur J. Pai's observation that <b>it</b> <b>lacked</b> mainstream media attention; AMPAS jury member Krishna Shah criticised its length and abundance of songs.|$|E
5|$|The CSM {{for this}} flight, number 012 built by North American Aviation (NAA), was a Block I version {{designed}} before the lunar orbit rendezvous landing strategy was chosen; therefore <b>it</b> <b>lacked</b> capability of docking with the Lunar Module. This {{was incorporated into}} the Block II CSM design, along with lessons learned in Block I. Block II would be test-flown with the LM when the latter was ready, and would be used on the Moon landing flights.|$|E
5|$|The Renown-class {{ships were}} {{fitted with a}} shallow anti-torpedo bulge {{integral}} to the hull which was intended to explode the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and vent the underwater explosion to the surface rather than into the ship. However, later testing proved {{that it was not}} deep enough to accomplish its task as <b>it</b> <b>lacked</b> the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force of the explosion.|$|E

5|$|The {{culture of}} Persia {{influenced}} Palmyrene military tactics, dress and court ceremonies. Palmyra had no large libraries or publishing facilities, and <b>it</b> <b>lacked</b> an intellectual movement characteristic of other Eastern {{cities such as}} Edessa or Antioch. Although Zenobia opened her court to academics, the only notable scholar documented was Cassius Longinus.|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} underwater protection {{was replaced}} by the Pugliese system that consisted of a large cylinder surrounded by fuel oil or water that was intended to absorb the blast of a torpedo warhead. <b>It</b> <b>lacked</b> enough depth to be fully effective against contemporary torpedoes. A major problem of the reconstruction was that the ships' increased draft meant that their waterline armor belt was almost completely submerged with any significant load.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} {{scarcity of}} hyena depictions in Paleolithic rock art has been theorised {{to be due}} to the animal's lower rank in the animal worship hierarchy; the spotted hyena's appearance was likely unappealing to Ice Age hunters, and it was not sought after as prey. Also, it was not a serious rival like the cave lion or cave bear, and <b>it</b> <b>lacked</b> the impressiveness of the mammoth or woolly rhino.|$|E
5|$|It is non-periodic, {{which means}} that <b>it</b> <b>lacks</b> any {{translational}} symmetry.|$|R
