König (Zingiberaceae), Hippeastrum reticulatum (L'Hérit.) Herb. (Amaryllidaceae), Scadoxus multiflorus (Martyn) Raf. (Amaryllidaceae), Prescottia nivalis Barb. Rodr. (Orchidaceae) e Sinningia aghensis Chautems (Gesneriaceae). O trabalho objetivou, também, avaliar os teores dos polissacarídeos de reserva de parede celular (PRPC) e de nutrientes minerais em sementes de Cassia fistula L., Cassia grandis L. f., Canavalia rosea (Sw.) DC., Erythrina variegata L., Hymenaea {{courbaril}} L. e Ormosia arborea (Vell.) Harms pertencentes à família Leguminosae. A espécie que apresentou maior conteúdo de frutose foi a bulbosa H. reticulatum (25 % MS) sugerindo a presença de frutanos em seus órgãos subterrâneos. Os maiores teores de carboidratos solúveis totais, especialmente a sacarose (63 % MS), foram observados em rizomas de P. nivalis, indicando que esse carboidrato desempenhe papel osmorregulador nessa rupestre revivescente. Quanto aos polissacarídeos de reserva de parede celular, maiores valores foram encontrados em sementes de H. courbaril (70 % MS), C. grandis (53 % MS) e C. rosea (40 % de MS). Valores intermediários foram obtidos em C. fistula (24 % de MS) e E. variegata (11 % MS). Sementes de O. arborea mostraram os mais baixos teores de PRPC não ultrapassando ao valor de 3 % da MS. Trabalhos anteriores denotam que o polissacarídeo de reserva de H. courbaril é do tipo xiloglucano, enquanto o de C. grandis, C. fistula e C. rosea seja do tipo galactomanano. A identificação do tipo de polissacarídeo de E. variegata e de O. arborea depende de análises futuras através da cromatografia líquida de alta eficiência. Dos nutrientes minerais, sementes de C. rosea e E. variegata destacaram pelos elevados teores de N (60 g. kg- 1) entre os macronutrientes e de Fe (160 - 170 mg. g- 1) e Zn (56 - 87 mg. g- 1) dentre os micronutrientes. Como constatado no presente trabalho, os estudos relacionados à bioprospecção revelam resultados promissores mostrando o grande potencial tecnológico de sementes e de órgãos subterrâneos de armazenamento encontrados na flora do Espírito Santo. The {{composition of}} nonstructural carbohydrates {{was investigated in}} the underground organs of the herbs <b>Dioscorea</b> <b>sp.</b> 1 and <b>Dioscorea</b> <b>sp.</b> 2 (Dioscoreaceae); Hedychium coronarium J.

We was also analyzed the levels of cell-wall storage polysaccharides (CWSP) and mineral nutrients in seeds of Cassia fistula L., Cassia grandis L. f., Canavalia rosea (Sw.) DC., Erythrina variegata L., Hymenaea courbaril L. and Ormosia arborea (Vell.) Harms from the Leguminosae family. H. reticulatum showed the highest fructose levels (25 % dry mass) suggesting the presence of fructans in the underground organs. The highest levels of total soluble carbohydrates, especially sucrose (63 %), were observed in rhizomes of P. nivalis indicating that this carbohydrate may act as an osmoregulator in this rock-dwelling resurrection plant. In relation to CWSP, high values were found in H. courbaril (70 %), C. grandis (53 %) and C. rosea (40 %) seeds. Intermediate values were found in C. fistula (24 %) and E. variegata (11 %). O. arborea seeds showed the lowest amount of WCP (< 3 % dry mass). Previous work {{has shown that the}} storage polysaccharides of H. courbaril are of the xyloglucan type while in C. grandis, C. fistula and C. rosea they are of the galactomanan type. Identification of the polysaccharide in E. variegata and O. arborea depends on future analyses by HPLC. In relation to mineral nutrients, C. rosea and E. variegata seeds stood out due to higher concentrations of N (60 g. kg- 1) among the macronutrients and higher concentrations of Fe (160170 mg. g- 1) and Zn (56 - 87 mg. g- 1) among the micronutrients.

40|$|As a {{clinical}} entity, {{sickle cell anemia}} (SCA) {{is known to be}} relatively rarer in Africans than in the African-American population of the United States. Paradoxically, sickle cell trait (SCT), the non-anemic, heterozygous condition, is about three times more common among indigenous Africans than in African-Americans. The ratio of SCA to SCT is 1 : 50 for African-Americans, and less than 1 : 1, 000 for tropical Africans. This etiological disparity is attributed to an anti-sickling agent, thiocyanate, (SCN-) found abundantly in staple African foods, such as the African yam (<b>Dioscorea</b> <b>sp)</b> and cassava (Manihot utilissima). Staple American foods have negligible SCN-concentrations. Nonstaple foods in the American diet, such as carrots, cabbage, and radishes, have SCN- levels far below the African yam and cassava.

40|$|Domestication' is a {{traditional}} farmers' practice reported for yams (<b>Dioscorea</b> <b>sp.)</b> in Benin (West Africa). It involves introducing 'spontaneous' (naturally occurring) yams, supposedly wild (D. abyssinica and D. praehensilis), in varieties of the D. cayenensis-D. rotundata cultivated species complex. In this study, we established the genetic nature of 'predomesticated' yam plants using the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique. A total of 213 accessions, consisting of 32 predomesticated yams, 70 D. cayenensis-D. rotundata, 86 D. abyssinica and 25 D. praehensilis yams were analysed. Using 91 AFLP markers, three groups of accessions were distinguished, broadly corresponding to the above botanical species. Of the 32 predomesticated accessions, 16 % were clustered with D. praehensilis, 37 % with D. abyssinica and the remaining 47 % with D. cayenensis-D. rotundata. These results demonstrated the use of wild plants by farmers in their domestication process, and suggested that plants derived from intervarietal and interspecific hybridisation may also be subject to this process. This study has shown that through domestication farmers influence and increase the genetic diversity in yam by using sexual reproduction of wild and possibly cultivated yams...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{contributing}} to the sustainable management of yam (<b>Dioscorea</b> <b>sp.)</b> diversity. It {{was carried out in}} northern Benin on 220 farms and in 8 villages. The main hypothesis considers that varietal diversity is influenced by ethnic diversity and the market. Results show that diversity remains high with 182 landraces observed in the fields. The study underlines the major role of cultivation practices and of socio-cultural determinants that depend on the history of each ethnic group. In relationship to this point, the Bariba, the Nago and the Gando, who have cultivated yams since remotest times, still remain the best social vectors of diversity. Characteristics of villages, such as links with the geographic and social levels, act on the level of diversity. The reduction of diversity brought about by market development is not confirmed. Facing the complexity of diversity determinant factors, the study concludes that the success of an in situ conservation policy will depend on the difficult choice of the area where it is carried out...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{traditional}} farmers' management on genetic diversity of {{vegetatively propagated crops}} is poorly documented. In this study, we analysed the impact of ennoblement of spontaneous yams, an original traditional farmers' practice, on the genetic diversity of yam (<b>Dioscorea</b> <b>sp.)</b> in Benin. We used 11 microsatellite markers on yam tubers from a small village in northern Benin and demonstrated that wild x cultivated hybrids are spontaneously formed. Many of the spontaneous yams collected by farmers from surrounding savannah areas for ennoblement were shown to be of wild and hybrid genotypes. Moreover, we demonstrated that some yam varieties have a wild or hybrid signature. Lastly, we performed a broader ranging genetic analysis on yam material from throughout Benin and showed that this practice is used in different ecological and ethno-linguistic regions. Through this practice, farmers create new varieties with new genetic combinations via sexual reproduction of wild and cultivated yams. This system, whereby a sexual cycle and asexual propagation are mixed, ensures potential large-scale cultivation of the best genotypes while preserving the potential for future adaptation...|$|E
40|$|Current archaeological {{research}} suggests that first human occupation of the Torres Strait Islands occurred sometime between 2500 and 3000 cal b. p., and evidence indicates {{that the development of}} agricultural mound-and-ditch systems occurred there after 1200 cal b. p. Although archaeological remains testify to the existence of a marine based subsistence economy prior to 1200 cal b. p., the potential presence of earlier prehistoric horticultural signatures has yet to be adequately examined. This study investigates such evidence through a preliminary application of fossil phytolith and starch grain analysis using excavated sediments from two archaeological sites on Dauar Island, eastern Torres Strait. The results show the early presence of yam (<b>Dioscorea</b> <b>sp.),</b> and Musa species not endemic to the island. The occurrence of these edible plant types in association with carbonised phytoliths and anthropogenic shell and bone deposits may be indicative of a combined insular horticultural and marine subsistence system on Dauar Island.

Dioscorea alata, also known as greater yam, {{is one of the major}} cultivated species and most widely distributed throughout the tropics. Despite its economic and cultural importance, very little is known about its origin, diversity and genetics. As a consequence, breeding efforts for resistance to its main disease, anthracnose, have been fairly limited. The objective of this study was to contribute to the understanding of D. alata genetic diversity by genotyping 384 accessions from different geographical regions (South Pacific, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean), using 24 microsatellite markers. Diversity structuration was assessed via Principal Coordinate Analysis, UPGMA analysis and the Bayesian approach implemented in STRUCTURE. Our results revealed the existence of a wide genetic diversity and a significant structuring associated with geographic origin, ploidy levels and morpho-agronomic characteristics. Seventeen major groups of genetically close cultivars have been identified, including eleven groups of diploid cultivars, four groups of triploids and two groups of tetraploids. STRUCTURE revealed the existence of six populations in the diploid genetic pool and a few admixed cultivars. These results will be very useful for rationalizing D. alata genetic resources in breeding programs across different regions and for improving germplasm conservation methods. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|Australian Research Council [DP 0450025]China {{is one of}} the few {{centers in}} the world where plant {{domestication}} evolved independently, but its developmental trajectory is poorly understood. This is because there is considerably less data from the terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene documented in China than in other regions, such as the Near East and Mesoamerica, and previous studies on Paleolithic subsistence in China have largely focused on animal hunting rather than plant gathering. To resolve these problems the current research investigated the range of plants used by late Paleolithic hunter-gatherers in the middle Yellow River region where some of the earliest farmers emerged. We employed usewear and starch analyses on grinding stones to recover evidence for plant use in a hunting-gathering population at a late Paleolithic site, Shizitan Locality 9 in Jixian, Shanxi (ca. 13, 800 - 8500 cal. BP). The usewear analysis shows that all artifacts preserved a range of usewear patterns best matching multiple tasks and indicating multi-functional use. Starch remains recovered from these tools indicate that the Shizitan people collected and processed many types of grass seeds (Panicoideae and Pooideae subfamilies), acorns (Quercus sp.), beans (Phaseoleae tribe) and yams (<b>Dioscorea</b> <b>sp.).</b> The Shizitan people represented some of the last hunter-gatherers in the middle Yellow River region. Their broad spectrum subsistence strategy was apparently carried on by the first Neolithic farmers in the same region, who collected similar wild plants and eventually domesticated millets. The trajectory from intensified collection of a wide range of wild plants to domestication of a small number of species was a very long process in north China. This parallels the transition from the "broad spectrum revolution" to agriculture in the Near East. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Food sectors {{have to face}} lots of hurdles {{today and}} their {{sustainability}} is called into question. We present here an original method that we developed to analyze the yam (<b>Dioscorea</b> <b>sp.)</b> food sector in Guadeloupe (FWI) and devise recommendations for its sustainable development. This three-step method aims at giving {{an overview of the}} sector by describing and analyzing the strategies and expectations of farmers, retailers and consumers. This overview makes it possible then to draw conclusions for improving the sustainability of the sector. In the first step we enquired yam farmers in order to characterize their productive strategies. We identified six different types of farms according to the importance placed on yam for income generation. In the second step we focused on marketing chains. We found that local yam is mostly traded informally via five main distribution chains that reflect farmers and retailers’ strategies. In the third step, we focused on yam consumers in order to identify ways to boost yam consumption. Focus group discussions helped us to identify the determinants of yam consumption and to devise hypotheses about ways to increase it. We then tested those hypotheses through a laboratory experiment in which we elicited consumers’ willingness to pay for different types of market signals: i) the intrinsic quality of a variety resistant to pathogens and of high testing quality, ii) a label about the local origin, iii) a label about the organic production. Our results showed that consumers were ready to pay a premium for the local and organically grown yam. We then discussed the interest of moving onto a certification scheme for the different types of farms and agents identified in the first and second stage. This study suggests that a way to improve the sustainability of the yam sector in Guadeloupe would be to mobilize farmers around a collective product qualification strategy...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of asexual propagation on the genetic diversity of yams is poorly understood. In tropical and subtropical regions, farming practices had unintended consequences {{and made it}} often impossible to distinguish wild yams from domesticated counterparts. This project aimed to investigate the ennobled yams, and specifically farmers’ impact on genetic divergence of Dioscorea alata, Dioscorea bulbifera, and Dioscorea cayenensis species. Forty-eight accessions were collected from Southwestern Ethiopia and South-west Malay Peninsula. Eighteen microsatellite markers developed by Tostain et al. (2006) were utilized to amplify marker loci from the leaves and tubers of yam accessions from Malaysia and Ethiopia (both cultivars and ennobled). The optimized annealing temperatures (Ta) and MgCl 2 concentrations for the PCR amplification were determined. Eighteen primers succeeded in amplifying Dioscorea cayenensis accessions. However, Da 1 D 08 primers failed in amplifying Dioscorea alata, and Dpr 3 B 12, Da 1 D 08, and Dab 2 E 09 primers from the eighteen primers were not successful in amplifying Dioscorea bulbifera samples. Dioscorea cayenensis species had {{the best record in}} optimum annealing temperature (Ta) compared to Dioscorea alata and Dioscorea bulbifera species. The fragment size produced by Ym 30, Da 1 A 01, Da 3 G 04, and Dpr 3 D 12 markers incorporated with M 13 FAM amplifying D. alata, D. bulbifera, and D. cayenensis species deployed in characterisation of the Dioscorea species that revealed a minor divergence between the three species. Moreover, the MgCl 2 and M 13 FMA influence on the PCR products was investigated and documented where the optimal annealing temperature (Ta) and fragment size of some Dioscorea species specimens were altered by the MgCl 2 different quantity in the PCR protocol. In addition, a discussion of the yam’s physical characterisation, and the impact of traditional farming management in different ecological and ethno-linguistic regions are included.
