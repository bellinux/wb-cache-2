25|$|These {{issues have}} been tied to {{grammatical}} processing performance by testing native speakers of English on the same tasks under stressful conditions: there is shown to be difficulty in <b>grammatical</b> <b>agreement</b> when memory capacity is curtailed, important cues in the language when given noisy input, and processing important structures when not given enough time to process input. This shows that knowledge cannot always be automatically and consistently applied under stressful situations without having processing difficulties. However, these issues are not necessarily independent of each other, as low decoding ability of structure could affect processing speed. Overall, individual differences in L2 working memory and decoding ability are correlated to grammaticality judgment accuracy and latencies. However, there is no correlation between speed of processing measure and grammaticality judgment performance, age of arrival correlates with syntactic mastery, and knowledge of vocabulary probably drives grammaticality performance.|$|E

We describe several techniques for inspecting such a system combination which are based both on automatic and manual evaluation. While TectoMT often produces bad translations, Moses is still able to select the good parts of them. In many cases, TectoMT provides useful novel translations which are otherwise simply unavailable to the statistical component, despite the very large training data. Our analyses confirm the expected behaviour that TectoMT helps with preserving <b>grammatical</b> <b>agreements</b> and valency requirements, but that it also improves a very diverse set of other phenomena. Interestingly, including the outputs of the transfer-based system in the phrase-based search seems to {{have a positive effect on}} the search space. Overall, we find that the components of this combination are complementary and the final system produces significantly better translations than either component by itself...|$|R

40|$|For native speakers, {{many studies}} suggest {{a link between}} oscillatory neural {{activity}} in the beta frequency range and syntactic processing. For late second language (L 2) learners on the other hand, {{the extent to which}} the neural architecture supporting syntactic processing is similar to or different from that of native speakers is still unclear. In a series of four experiments, we used electroencephalography to investigate the link between beta oscillatory activity and the processing of <b>grammatical</b> gender <b>agreement</b> in Dutch determiner-noun pairs, for Dutch native speakers, and for German L 2 learners of Dutch. In Experiment 1 we show that for native speakers, <b>grammatical</b> gender <b>agreement</b> violations are yet another among many syntactic factors that modulate beta oscillatory activity during sentence comprehension. Beta power is higher for grammatically acceptable target words than for those that mismatch in grammatical gender with their preceding determiner. In Experiment 2 we observed no such beta modulations for L 2 learners, irrespective of whether trials were sorted according to objective or subjective syntactic correctness. Experiment 3 ruled out that the absence of a beta effect for the L 2 learners in Experiment 2 was due to repetition of the target nouns in objectively correct and incorrect determiner-noun pairs. Finally, Experiment 4 showed that when L 2 learners are required to explicitly focus on grammatical information, they show modulations of beta oscillatory activity, comparable to those of native speakers, but only when trials are sorted according to participants’ idiosyncratic lexical representations of the grammatical gender of target nouns. Together, these findings suggest that beta power in L 2 learners is sensitive to violations of <b>grammatical</b> gender <b>agreement,</b> but only when the importance of grammatical information is highlighted, and only when participants' subjective lexical representations are taken into account...|$|R

In some theories of parsing, gender is assumed to immediately and categorically block gender-incongruent phrase structure alternatives from being pursued.

40|$|Various {{cognitive}} control {{processes are}} generally assumed {{to take place}} in the production of written language. The studies reported in this thesis aimed at assessing the extent to which visual information is involved in such control operations that might underlie the production of number agreement. Sentences with various linguistic characteristics and target agreements were dictated to French speaking university students who were simply asked to write them down. They were required to do this in different conditions according to whether they could see what they were writing or not, and according to whether they were constrained by an additive cognitive load or not. Using a pen tablet allowed us to record and to analyze their writing online. Thanks to different measures based on errors, pauses (with the assumption that long pauses could reflect a pre-graphic control of the agreement), corrections (with the assumption that such corrections could reflect a post-graphic control of the agreement) and writing speed, we show that visual feedbacks impact the control of <b>grammatical</b> <b>agreements.</b> When they are suppressed, the proportion of errors increases but the writing speed decreases as well as the proportion of pre- and post-graphic controls. In addition, we showed that visual feedbacks impact the agreements control in various ways depending {{on the nature of the}} agreement and, in case of verbal agreement, on the linear distance with the subject.
