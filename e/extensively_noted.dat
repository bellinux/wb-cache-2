40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Turkey's {{activism}} in Africa has been <b>extensively</b> <b>noted.</b> It {{has been argued}} that non-state actors like business and civil society organizations take part in Turkeys Africa initiative. Nevertheless, state/non-state interaction in Turkey's foreign policy implementation has not been accounted for in theoretical terms in Turkish foreign policy literature. This paper combines post-international theory and foreign policy implementation in looking at Turkey's foreign policy towards sub-Saharan Africa. We argue that adapting to the multi-centric world, the Turkish government has moved beyond conventional state-to-state dealings in implementing its foreign policy and increasingly relies on the cooperation of non-state actors...|$|E

40|$|Current {{literature}} has <b>extensively</b> <b>noted</b> the sizeable Islamic Extremist online media campaign, {{but has not}} studied the relationship of this online world with the violent extremist activities of the actual world, and more importantly, what real world events contribute to activity on these forums. Thus, this thesis examines {{the relationship between the}} offline and online world by examining whether these forums are incited by successful terrorist actions whether offensive US actions, measured by drone strikes, contribute to forum activity. Using a regression analysis, this thesis tests for correlation between spikes in post counts from 27 Islamic extremist forums and drone strike occurrences and spikes in global Islamic extremist-caused casualties measured in the Global Terrorism Database. Following the regression, I present three case studies of specific spikes, which examine the drone strikes, terrorist attacks, and forum content during the spike. I find that there is significant correlation between spikes in terrorist-caused casualties and forum posts, but that there is no significant relationship between drone strikes and spikes in forum posts.

40|$|Although college {{graduates}} earn substantial labor market rewards, not all college degrees are rewarded equally. Graduates who majored in female-dominated fields earn substantially lower incomes than do graduates who majored in male-dominated fields. Income differentials {{that are associated}} with different types of college majors are <b>extensively</b> <b>noted</b> but poorly under-stood. This article advances the previous literature by examining how college major affects the labor market outcomes of {{college graduates}} through its relationship with employment sector. The results show that graduates of female-dominated fields are disproportionately employed in public and nonprofit organizations, which offer lower monetary rewards but facilitate access to professional and managerial positions. Notably, college major and employment sector inter-act in ways that reduce income penalties and enhance the occupational location of graduates of female-dominated fields who work in public and nonprofit settings. These findings high-light the importance of considering organizational context in the study of labor market out-comes, particularly when examining the gendered character of educational credentials and occupations. College graduates earn substantial labormarket rewards, which has led someauthors to conclude that “completing the bachelor’s degree may be the single most important educational step in the occupa-tional and economic attainment process” (Pascarella and Terenzini 1991 : 529; see als...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of the 1991 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 19 - 20, 1991, Athens, Georgia. Lake Sidney Lanier, {{located in}} northeastern Georgia, {{is a large}} {{reservoir}} in a watershed that is agricultural with urban and considerable suburban residential areas. Lake Lanier provides the drinking water for 60 {{percent of the population}} of Georgia and is also heavily used for recreation. Recreation, increasing urban and suburban development, and continued agriculture have resulted in siltation, sewage loading from treatment plants and septic tanks, and non-point source pollution. However, many of the effects that normally occur in heavily developed lakes, such as decreased transparency and blue-green algal blooms, have not been <b>extensively</b> <b>noted</b> in Lake Lanier. Data from a water quality monitoring program begun in 1987 are reported here and compared to data collected in 1978 and 1979 in order to evaluate the trophic status of Lake Lanier over the last 12 years.
