5|$|Baptism {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an important rite {{throughout the history of}} the Christian Church, but Christian groups differ over the manner in which baptism is administered, the meaning and significance of baptism, its role in salvation, and who <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> baptism.|$|E
5|$|Quants, a {{grassland}} clearing in a forestry plantation {{well known}} for its butterflies including Duke of Burgundy, marsh fritillary and wood white, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> Special Area of Conservation (cSAC). These are designated under the European Commission Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) as internationally important habitats.|$|E
5|$|Blythburgh, a {{mile from}} Bulcamp and {{situated}} near the fordable headwaters of the Blyth estuary, was afterwards {{believed to be the}} location of the tombs of Anna and Jurmin. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> a monastic site or a royal regio (estate). According to Peter Warner, the Latin derivation of part of the nearby place-name 'Bulcamp' indicates its ancient origins, and mediaeval sources which claim continuous Christian worship at Blythburgh throughout the Anglo-Saxon period provide circumstantial evidence of its connections with East Anglian royalty and Christianity. Part of an 8th-century whalebone diptych or writing-tablet, used for liturgical purposes, has been found near the site.|$|E

5|$|Kates {{built the}} game to {{showcase}} his additron tube, a miniature version of the vacuum tube, though the transistor overtook it in computer development shortly thereafter. Patent issues prevented the additron tube from being used in computers besides Bertie before {{it was no longer}} useful. Bertie the Brain <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the first video game, as it was potentially the first computer game to have any sort of visual display of the game. It appeared only three years after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game to use an electronic display. Berties use of light bulbs rather than a screen with real-time visual graphics, however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions of a video game.|$|E
5|$|The game of Nim {{running on}} the Nimrod <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> {{one of the first}} video games, as {{it was one of the}} first {{computer}} games to have any sort of visual display of the game. It appeared only four years after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game to use an electronic display, and one year after Bertie the Brain, a computer similar to the Nimrod which played tic-tac-toe at the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. The Nimrod's use of light bulbs rather than a screen with real-time visual graphics, however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions of a video game.|$|E

25|$|There are {{at least}} five exotic meson {{resonances}} that have been experimentally confirmed to exist by two or more independent experiments. The most statistically significant {{of these is the}} Z(4430), discovered by the Belle experiment in 2007 and confirmed by LHCb in 2014. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> being a tetraquark: a particle composed of two quarks and two antiquarks.

While telling Vernor and Enderman the history of Centennial (Garrett's voice narrates the miniseries), he is persuaded to run against Wendell in the election.|$|E
25|$|String {{theory is}} a broad and varied subject that {{attempts}} to address a number of deep questions of fundamental physics. String theory {{has been applied to}} a variety of problems in black hole physics, early universe cosmology, nuclear physics, and condensed matter physics, and it has stimulated a number of major developments in pure mathematics. Because string theory potentially provides a unified description of gravity and particle physics, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> a theory of everything, a self-contained mathematical model that describes all fundamental forces and forms of matter. Despite much work on these problems, it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world or how much freedom the theory allows to choose the details.|$|E

2500|$|Nodena is {{the type}} site for an {{important}} Late Mississippian cultural component, the Nodena phase, which dates from about 14001700 CE.

2500|$|During {{his time}} as governor, Ventura wrote a number of {{politically}} themed books. He continued to write several other books after leaving office. In April 2008, a book authored by Ventura, titled Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, was released.

In {{an interview with the}} Associated Press {{at the time of the}} book's release, however, Ventura denied any plans for a presidential bid, stating that the scenario is only imaginary and not indicative of a [...] "secret plan to run". On MinnPost.com, Ventura's agent, Steve Schwartz, described the book thus: [...] " [...] why he left politics and discussing the disastrous war in Iraq, why he sees our two-party system as corrupt, and what Fidel Castro told him about who was really behind the assassination of President Kennedy." ...|$|E
