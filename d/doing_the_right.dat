Critic Roger Ebert wrote in his 1991 review that the Coens intended to create an allegory for the rise of Nazism. [...] "They paint Fink as an ineffectual and impotent left-wing intellectual, who sells out while telling himself he is <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing, who thinks he understands the 'common man' but does not understand that, for many common men, fascism had a seductive appeal".

The editorial staff observed [...] "the considerable changes made to the engine, HUD and combat system, transforming it into {{a far cry from}} the game that disappointed so many". However, GameSpot's Jonathan Toyad was less confident about the game, praising the changes but commenting that many features would seem overly familiar to players of modern MMORPGs.|$|E

Bart's PC translation might be just a little off-model, but it's a gigantic leap over his duck-like visage seen on the NES." [...] He added, however, that the game [...] "is completely unintuitive, your goals aren't made clear, it's never certain if you're <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing, and you're often locked into screens with no apparent way out but death."
