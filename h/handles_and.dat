5|$|The cup {{came to the}} British Museum with a {{custom-made}} hexagonal case {{of leather}} on a wood frame, with iron lock, <b>handles</b> <b>and</b> mounts.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Handling</b> <b>and</b> stabilities is {{important}} for steer by wire (SBW) system. Firstly, a platform for SBW <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> stabilities analysis and parameter optimization with friendly graphic user interface (GUI) {{is built based on}} Matlab GUI technology. Secondly, three degree of freedom <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> stabilities model with steering angle as input is built and system stability is analyzed based on Routh-Hurwitz stability and poles methods. Then simulations are carried out to show effects of some vehicle parameters on <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> stabilities. Finally, the <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> stabilities sensitive parameters are optimized using genetic algorithm method to improve step responses <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> stabilities...|$|R

5|$|Ceramic finds at {{the site}} include {{frequent}} finds of incense-burners with <b>handles</b> <b>and</b> molded decoration. The most common domestic ceramics are of a micaceous ware and include ceramic comals (a type of griddle). Imported ceramics include Chinautla Polychrome and White-on-red, they are reasonably common {{at the site}}. Brown bowls are of a type also found in Zaculeu and Mixco Viejo, both of which also had a Late Postclassic occupation. Three-legged metates (a kind of mortar) were frequently recovered from the excavations and black obsidian blades were found in great quantities. Simple jade jewellery was also found.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Nakashima, Francois Sammer (a Czech {{architect}} {{who had worked}} for Le Corbusier in Russia) and Chandulal (a devotee who had trained as an engineer), built a full-scale model of the dormitory in order to test the feasibility of the design, and then used it as a laboratory to further refine the construction methods. Nakashima's duties included doing very explicit detail drawings showing, for example, the design of the concrete formwork. Devotees even donated brass utensils so that they could be melted down to make door <b>handles</b> <b>and</b> hinges.|$|E
5|$|MY09: {{models were}} {{launched}} on 15 March 2008. Six airbags were made standard across the range—Omega and SV6 variants were previously fitted with two and four airbags respectively. Omega models also received standard fitment of air conditioning, 16-inch alloy wheels, body colour wing mirrors and door <b>handles,</b> <b>and</b> a new grille insert with chrome highlights. Revised alloy wheel designs were {{featured on the}} Calais (seven-spoke) and Calais V (10-spoke).|$|E

The Valtra tractor business was sold to AGCO, a worldwide agricultural manufacturer. As the structure of KONE Materials Handling had changed significantly, the name KONE Cargotec was introduced in January 2004.

5|$|The Seri Rambai is a 28-pounder, 127.5 inches (3.25m) {{long with}} a calibre of 6.1 inches; (15cm); the barrel {{measures}} 118.75 inches; (3.02 m). It {{was cast in}} 1603 and is the largest bronze gun in Malaysia. In front of the dolphin handles is a decorative band featuring three pairs of heraldic lions with long, spiralling tails. Each pair faces a vase containing flowers. Between the <b>handles</b> <b>and</b> the Dutch East India Company's seal is a Javi inscription, inlaid with silver, celebrating the gun's capture in 1613. The base ring is incised with the gunsmith's signature and date of manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Ceramics lend {{themselves}} to circular motifs, whether radial or tangential. Bowls or plates can be decorated inside or out with radial stripes; these may be partly figurative, representing stylised leaves or flower petals, while circular bands can run around a bowl or jug. Patterns of these types were employed on Islamic ceramics from the Ayyubid period, 13thcentury. Radially symmetric flowers with, say, 6 petals {{lend themselves}} to increasingly stylised geometric designs which can combine geometric simplicity with recognisably naturalistic motifs, brightly coloured glazes, and a radial composition that ideally suits circular crockery. Potters often chose patterns suited {{to the shape of}} the vessel they were making. Thus an unglazed earthenware water flask from Aleppo {{in the shape of a}} vertical circle (with <b>handles</b> <b>and</b> neck above) is decorated with a ring of moulded braiding around an Arabic inscription with a small 8-petalled flower at the centre.|$|E

A moment later, the aircraft was struck by a second SA-2 and exploded. The remainder of the aircraft's six-man crew—Maj. Wayne L. Bolte, pilot; 1st Lt.. Robin F. Gatwood, co-pilot; and EWOs Lt. Col. Anthony R. Giannangeli, Lt. Col. Charles A. Levis, and Maj. Henry M. Serex—were unable to eject and were listed as missing in action. Their remains were never found.|$|E

5|$|Prevented from {{cutting the}} French line ahead of Achille, HMS Brunswick turned {{and tried to}} cross aft of her, between Achille and Vengeur. Seeing the manoeuvre, Renaudin also {{accelerated}} to close this new gap, and Brunswick and Vengeur collided, the anchor of Brunswick becoming entangled in the rigging of Vengeur. Vengeur fired an entire broadside at point-blank range, but was then unable to fire her main batteries again, the ships being so close as to prevent French gunners from ramming ammunition into their guns; in contrast, British gunners used rammers with semi-rigid rope handles instead of wooden <b>handles,</b> <b>and</b> were able to reload and maintain a sustained fire, riddling Vengeur with holes. The fight went on for four hours, until Brunswick, after shattering the rudder of Vengeur to prevent her from manoeuvring, separated at 12:45. Her fire also opened a large hole in the hull of Vengeur.|$|E
5|$|These suggest that, {{after the}} sacking of Jerusalem by AntiochusIV in 168BCE, {{at least part}} of the City of David to the south of the Temple Mount was rebuilt as a {{fortified}} Hellenistic quarter of Jerusalem. More than a citadel, it was a Macedonian colony where Jewish renegades and supporters of the new regime lived. This is also supported by archaeological evidence, including Rhodian amphorae <b>handles</b> <b>and</b> 18 box graves found on the eastern slope of the City of David. The latter are dated to the early 2nd century CE, and are uncharacteristic of Second Temple era Jewish burial practices, yet similar to other known Hellenistic graveyards such as the one in Acre (Ptolemais).|$|E
25|$|Designed by Alfa Centro Stile {{under the}} {{guidance}} of head designer Walter de'Silva the 156s shape was distinctly Alfa Romeo. Its style included high curved flanks, retro styled front door handles, recessed rear door <b>handles,</b> <b>and</b> a dramatic deep grille, which necessitated a highly unusual off-centre licence plate holder. The car {{was one of the first}} saloons, and wagons, to feature hidden rear door <b>handles</b> <b>and</b> prominent front door handles to give it a coupé look. The design was influenced by three historical Alfa Romeo models: the 1900, the Giulietta and the Giulia. The 156 achieved a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.31.|$|E
