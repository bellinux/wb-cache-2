For {{hatchery}} {{production of}} Penaeus monodon and other penaeid fry, the SEAFDEC Aquaculture Department is dependent mainly on captive broodstock {{in the form}} of ablated females, using up to 1, 500 spawners in one year. The availability of such broodstock has enabled us to gather information on the reproductive biology as well as broodstock techniques for P. monodon and other species. This paper discusses studies on courtship and mating behaviour, fecundity, egg quality and rematuration; and requirements for induced maturation (source and age of stock, sex ratio, <b>feeding,</b> <b>tank</b> management, etc.) of P. monodon. A comparison of biological and construction requirements of two broodstock systems â€” land-based tanks and marine pens â€” is made. Work on other penaeids, mainly P. indicus is discussed.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the apparent protein and energy digestibility of common feed ingredients (soybean meal, fish meal, wheat meal and corn) by juvenile oscars using two different sampling intervals (30 min. and 12 h). The 160 juvenile oscar fish tested (22. 37 ± 3. 06 g BW) {{were divided into}} four cylindrical plastic net cages, each one placed in a 1000 L <b>feeding</b> <b>tank.</b> The experiment was completely randomized in a 2 x 4 factorial design (2 feces collection intervals and 4 feed ingredients) with four replications. The statistical tests did not detect an interaction effect of sampling interval and type of ingredient on digestibility coefficients. Sampling interval did not affect protein and energy digestibility. The physical characteristics of juvenile oscar feces likely make them less susceptible to nutrient loss by leaching and can therefore be collected at longer intervals. Protein digestibility of the different ingredients was similar, showing that apparent digestibility of both animal and plant ingredients by juvenile oscars was efficient. Energy digestibility coefficients of fish meal and soybean meal were {{higher than those of}} wheat meal and corn. Carbohydrate-rich ingredients (wheat meal and corn) had the worst energy digestibility coefficients and are therefore not used efficiently by juvenile oscars. </p...|$|E

The aim of this work is to design and devise filling sauce equipment; consisting of a filling sauce device and a refill sauce storage tank. This type of the tank when using in a sauce filling step causes fluctuations of sauce flow rate into cans. This leads {{to the possibility of}} sauce overflow or deficit. In addition, when the hole sizes of a filling sauce device are inappropriately designed, this results in fluctuating of sauce filling into cans. Therefore, this work introduces an approach to overcome the difficulties by adding another tank to maintain the level of the sauce in the <b>feeding</b> <b>tank</b> first. Then, the filling sauce device is properly designed. With this approach, the sauce loss can be reduced by about 84. 2 % per day or the saving of sauce is 24 litres per day. The payback period is less than 9 months. Consequently, this work is applicable to decrease any sauce loss filling into cans in other canning industries.

This monitoring tool does more than just supervision: it interprets the signals and verifies the consistency and coherency with predefined criteria and without intervening in the process. These criteria {{are based on the}} design characteristics of the recipients and transfer mechanism. In the case of the solution process in a reprocessing plant, the signals are visualizing the solution properties (temperature, density) and tank levels. The change in tank level of the <b>feeding</b> <b>tank</b> is cross-checked against the corresponding change in tank level of the communicating process tank and the software verifies the coherency in total mass transferred. In particular the start of a transfer has to be recognized appropriately and that with the appropriate signal profile, that differs for siphon transfer and mechanical pumping. In order to ensure that no nuclear material is diverted, a complete accountancy system is imposed that combines verifications with high accuracy of low frequency (in general annually), with those of high frequency but with lower accuracy. Mainly the latter one, also known under near-real time accountancy, enhances the quality of executing the procedures, because it allows the inspector to localize in time a leakage problem to the operators.

40|$|Nase (Chondrostoma nasus) {{and common}} barbel (Barbus barbus) are two rheophilic cyprinid fish {{naturally}} present in South Belgian rivers. During the last decades, {{the construction of}} dams together with changes in hydrological regimes, modifications of riverbed morphology and water pollution caused some local dramatic declines in their populations. However, recent improvements in terms of water quality and habitat fragmentation allow now to implement a rational restocking plan of locally endangered patrimonial fish species such as nase and common barbel. To reach this goal, this project (co-funded by the European Fisheries Fund and the Wallonia Public Service) proposed to develop five complementary parts with specific objectives: • Review of the knowledge on nase and barbel geographical distribution and stock health in Wallonia. This section presents the distribution and recent evolution of populations in Europe, and more specifically in Wallonia. Areas where population declines were reported are identified. Even if a weak population expansion was reported in some isolated cases, the global status of Walloon populations is still concerning. • Characterization of genetic structure and diversity of South Belgium populations. Restocking operations for a conservation purpose have {{to be based on}} the knowledge and the use of wild type genetic strains. Nase and barbel populations from South Belgium were genetically characterized by use of microsatellites. Globally, nase and barbel populations are structured on a basin scale. A slight genetic differentiation exists between populations from the Rhine basin and the Meuse basin, defining two conservation units, but no finer structure was observed among populations from the Meuse basin. Genetic variation was high within populations. Genetic structure of barbel populations is more complex due to past restocking operations with different genetic lineages. An analysis of mDNA identified 6 different haplotypes but was unable to categorize them as autochtone or allochtone. • Development of fish production techniques. The complete control of fish farming is necessary to produce high quality juveniles for restocking. All the steps of the production cycle were addressed: broodstock management and reproduction, egg incubation, larval rearing and grow-out. Production systems ranging from extensive pond culture to intensive RAS were tested and the optimal farming conditions were identified (temperature, density, <b>feeding,</b> <b>tank</b> volumes, …). • Adaptation assessment of farmed fingerlings to natural conditions. Growth and survival performances of captive farmed fish were assessed in an experimental environment that mimics natural conditions. The results suggested that the more efficient practice for restocking would be based on operations performed in spring with large juveniles (3 to 50 g). • Know-how diffusion toward fish farmers. All the breeding and grow-out techniques developed for nase and barbel production are the subject of two handbooks. These documents, attached to the report, will be published and distributed to fish producers...|$|E

This approach relies on formulating and numerically treating probabilistic constraints. The inflow rate is considered as a stochastic process for which two basically different model assumptions are made: the first model assumes a Gaussian process, and thus reflects the superposition of many independent elementary inflows; the second model treats maybe the simplest case of a single elementary inflow profile, namely rectangular inflows with fixed rate and duration but stochastic starting time.

40|$|Foaming {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{problems}} that occasionally occurring in biogas plants affecting negatively the overall anaerobic digestion (AD) process. According to a recent survey, 15 out of 16 full-scale biogas plants, which were surveyed in Denmark, faced foaming incidents in the main reactor and/or in the pre-storage <b>feeding</b> <b>tank,</b> resulting in 30 - 50 % biogas production loss (Kougias et al., 2014). In activated sludge systems and in wastewater treatment plants the major causes of foaming are organic overload, the presence of surface active agents, operational parameters (e. g. digester’s shape, mixing system etc) and filamentous microorganisms (e. g. Gordonia species, Microthrix parvicella) (Ganidi et al., 2009). However, the contribution of specific microorganisms on foam generation in biogas reactors fed with agro-industrial wastes has not been previously investigated. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the microbiology of biogas reactors fed with different substrates prior and after foaming incidents. The experiment was carried out in three continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR) denoted as R 1, R 2 and R 3. The total and the working volume of each reactor was 2 and 1. 5 L, respectively. Each reactor was continuously stirred using a magnetic stirrer. The operating temperature was maintained at 54 ± 1 °C using thermal jackets. Each reactor was fed with a different mixed substrate, which was found to have an influence on foam formation in our previous study (Kougias et al., 2013). The hydraulic retention time (HRT) of all reactors was kept constant at 15 days. The whole experiment was divided into two periods. During the first period, the reactors were fed only with cattle manure. Once steady state conditions were reached, liquid sample from all reactors was obtained for DNA extraction and metagenomic analysis. After sampling, the feedstock composition of each reactor was changed by the addition of gelatine or Na-Oleate or glucose (second experimental period). As a consequence, foam formation was observed in all reactors approximately after one HRT period. Once the daily volume of the formed foam was steady, samples were taken again for DNA extraction and metagenomic analysis. Results from the present study revealed significant variations in the microbiology of the manure-based biogas reactors after foam initiation. A number of genera could be linked to foaming as they produce biosurfactants (Lactobacillus, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Thermotoga), others contain mycolic acid in their cell wall (Thermoactinomyces, Pseudonocardia) or decrease the surface tension of the media (Micrococcus, Streptococcus). Frankia, Dialister and Paenibacillus are known to be correlated to this phenomenon but their mechanism is still unclear. Finally, microorganisms that have a widely known association with foaming were identified when the identification threshold for the microorganisms was decreased to similar levels reported in the cited literature; however, the latter, due to its high importance, needs to be further investigated.

The fluxes and the diffusion coefficients obtained from a single transient run, and from a sequence of steady state runs are compared and the observed differences are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} comprises a {{fluid sampling}} system which allows sampling of radioactive liquid without spillage. A <b>feed</b> <b>tank</b> {{is connected to}} a liquid transfer jet powered by a pumping chamber pressurized by compressed air. The liquid is pumped up into a sampling jet of venturi design having a lumen with an inlet, an outlet, a constricted middle portion, and a port located above the constricted middle portion. The liquid is passed under pressure through the constricted portion causing its velocity to increase and its pressure to decrease, thereby preventing liquid from escaping. A septum sealing the port can be pierced by a two pointed hollow needle leading into a sample bottle also sealed by a pierceable septum affixed to one end. The bottle is evacuated by flow through the sample jet, cyclic variation in the sampler jet pressure periodicially leaves the evacuated bottle with lower pressure {{than that of the}} port, thus causing solution to pass into the bottle. The remaining solution in the system is returned to the <b>feed</b> <b>tank</b> via a holding tank...|$|R
40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) was {{requested}} {{to develop a}} bench scale test facility, using a mixer, transfer pump, and transfer line to determine the impact of conveying the grout through the transfer lines to the vault on grout properties. Bench scale testing focused on the effect the transfer line has on the rheological property of the grout as it was processed through the transfer line. Rheological and other physical properties of grout samples were obtained prior to and after pumping through a transfer line. The Bench Scale Mixing Rig (BSMR) consisted of two mixing <b>tanks,</b> grout <b>feed</b> <b>tank,</b> transfer pump and transfer hose. The mixing tanks were used to batch the grout which was then transferred into the grout <b>feed</b> <b>tank.</b> The contents of the <b>feed</b> <b>tank</b> were then pumped through the transfer line (hose) using a progressive cavity pump. The grout flow rate and pump discharge pressure were monitored. Four sampling stations were located {{along the length of}} the transfer line at the 5, 105 and 205 feet past the transfer pump and at 305 feet, the discharge of the hose. Scaling between the full scale piping at Saltstone to bench scale testing at SRNL was performed by maintaining the same shear rate and total shear at the wall of the transfer line. The results of scaling down resulted in a shorter transfer line, a lower average velocity, the same transfer time and similar pressure drops. The condition of flow in the bench scale transfer line is laminar. The flow in the full scale pipe is in the transition region, but is more laminar than turbulent. The resulting plug in laminar flow in the bench scale results in a region of no-mixing. Hence mixing, or shearing, at the bench scale should be less than that observed in the full scale, where this plug is non existent due to the turbulent flow. The bench scale tests should be considered to be conservative due to the highly laminar condition of flow that exists. Two BSMR runs were performed. In both cases, wall shearing was shown to reduce the rheological properties of the grout as it was processed through the transfer line. Samples taken at the static <b>feed</b> <b>tank</b> showed that gelling impacted the rheological properties of the grout before it was fed into the pump and transfer line. A comparison of the rheological properties of samples taken at the <b>feed</b> <b>tank</b> and transfer line discharge indicated shearing of the grout was occurring in the transfer line. Bench scale testing of different mixing methods with three different salt solutions showed that method of mixing influences the rheological properties of the grouts. The paddle blade mixing method of the salt solution used for the BMSR testing provided comparable rheological properties of the grout prepared in the BMSR after 14 minutes of processing, B 3. The paddle blade mixing method can be used to represent BMSR results and mixing time can be adjusted to represent larger scale mixing...|$|R
