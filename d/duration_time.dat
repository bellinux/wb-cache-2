25|$|Each dance round, {{called a}} tip, {{typically}} {{consists of two}} dances. The first dance part {{is known as a}} hash call, which is characterized by its unstructured and often puzzling dance choreography. The music is usually instrumental and the calls are typically not sung, but rather rhythmically spoken. The second dance part of a square dance tip is a singing call. The dance instructions are sung as well as the lyrics during the long duration calls. The music are often popular songs and the calls are timed to fit. During a singing call the female dancers temporarily switch partners in a counter-clockwise order around the square until they return to their original partners. The caller restores the original order of the square both {{at the end of the}} hash and the singing call. The <b>duration</b> <b>time</b> of a tip may vary, but is usually between ten and twenty minutes. Between tips, dancers are generally encouraged to find other dance partners and form new squares for the next tip.|$|E
25|$|Nerve excitability {{examination}} complements conventional nerve conduction {{studies by}} allowing insight into biophysical characteristics of axons, {{as well as}} their ion-channel functioning. The protocol is aimed at providing information about nodal as well as internodal ion channels, and the indices are extremely sensitive to axon membrane potential. These studies have provided insight into conditions characterized by changes in resting potential, such as electrolyte concentration and pH, as well as specific ion-channel and pump function in normal and diseased nerves. Furthermore, software programs enabling the calculation of rheobasic and time constant values from both normal and diseased nerves have recently enabled researchers to pinpoint some important factors for a number of pervasive nerve disorders, many of which involve substantial demyelination (see Clinical Significance). Supraximal electrical stimulation and measurement of conduction velocity and amplitudes of compound motor (CMAP) and sensory (SNAP) responses provide measures of the number and conduction velocities of large myelinated fibers. Additionally, multiple measures of excitability in the TROND protocol permit assessment of ion channels (transient and persistent Na+ channels, slow K+ channels) at nodes of Ranvier by computing stimulus response curves, strength <b>duration</b> <b>time</b> constant (chronaxie), rheobase, and the recovery cycle after passage of an action potential. This is accomplished by applying long polarizing currents to the nerve and measuring the influence of voltage on voltage gated-ion channels beneath myelin.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{calculate}} the <b>duration</b> <b>times</b> of frosts by Delphi programming. To do this, the data related to the daily minimum temperature of four meteorology stations of Lorestan Province, i. e., Khoram-Abad, Boroujerd, Doroud and Aligoudarz that enjoy a ten-year statistics (from 1993 to 2003) were obtained from the information bank of the National Meteorology Organization. After taking out the frost days in desired threshold (zero and less than zero) during the statistical period, frost <b>duration</b> <b>times</b> of each station were calculated and extracted, using algorithm of the afore-mentioned program. Then, the <b>duration</b> <b>times</b> were selectively divided into eight (three-hour) classes. Their frequency percent charts were drawn and all stations were compared to one another in three classes of 0 to 3 h, 9 to 12 h and 21 to 24 h. It was concluded that Boroujerd Station enjoys the most frost hours and, hence damages to crops were the highest in this station compared with other stations. It was further concluded that the vegetation is the most effective factor in frost <b>duration</b> <b>times</b> of the region and that the height factor has no effect on frost <b>duration</b> <b>times...</b>|$|R

The department quantified pollution with an air quality index, a single number based on combined measurements of sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and haze or smoke levels in the air. The city laboratory recorded the presence of those three pollutants, as measured by amount (concentration in parts-per-million, or ppm) and <b>duration</b> (<b>time).</b> The data for those three pollutants were combined into a single number using a formula developed by department co-founder Moe Mordecai Braverman. The index average was 12, with an [...] "emergency" [...] level if the index was higher than 50 for a 24-hour period. The average, 12, was determined from data collected between 1957 and 1964, and the [...] "emergency" [...] level of 50 was announced in 1964. The index system used by the city in 1966 is not in use anywhere today and was unique to the city even at the time; the 1966 smog itself prompted scientists to reexamine and improve the city's methodology for recording air-pollutant levels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{notion of}} the {{necessary}} criticality (both with respect to path and to activity) of a network with imprecisely defined (by means of intervals or fuzzy intervals) activity <b>duration</b> <b>times</b> is introduced and analyzed. It is shown, in the interval case, that both the problem of asserting whether a given path is necessarily critical {{and the problem of}} determining an arbitrary necessarily critical path (more exactly, a subnetwork covering all the necessarily critical paths) are easy. The corresponding solution algorithms are proposed. However, the problem of evaluating whether a given activity is necessarily critical {{does not seem to be}} such. Certain conditions are formulated which in some situations (but not in all possible) allow evaluating the necessary criticality of activities. The results obtained for networks with interval activity <b>duration</b> <b>times</b> are generalized to the case of networks with fuzzy activity <b>duration</b> <b>times.</b> Two effective algorithms of calculating the degree of necessary criticality of a fixed path, as well as an algorithm of determining the paths that are necessarily critical to the maximum degree, are proposed.

40|$|Some {{statistical}} methods developed {{recently in the}} biometrics and econometrics literature show great promise for improving the analysis of <b>duration</b> <b>times</b> in marketing. They incorporate the right censoring that is prevalent in <b>duration</b> <b>times</b> data, {{and can be used}} to make a wide variety of useful predictions. Both of these features make these methods preferable to the regression, logit, and discriminant analyses that marketers have typically used in analyzing durations. This paper is intended to fulfill three objectives. First, we demonstrate how decision situations that involve durations differ from other marketing phenomena. Second, we show how standard modeling approaches to handle <b>duration</b> <b>times</b> can break down because of the peculiarities inherent in durations. It has been suggested in recent marketing articles that an alternative to these conventional procedures, i. e., hazard rate models and proportional hazard regression, can more effectively handle duration type data. Third, to investigate whether these proposed benefits are in fact delivered for marketing durations data, we estimate and validate both conventional and hazard rate models for household interpurchase times of saltine crackers. Our findings indicate the superiority of proportional hazard regression methods vis-à-vis common procedures in terms of stability and face validity of the estimates and in predictive accuracy. econometric modeling, estimation and other statistical techniques, pricing research, promotion, regression and other statistical techniques...|$|R
