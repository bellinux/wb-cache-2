500|$|The main {{objective}} of this compliance requirement is that only eligible individuals or organizations participate in federal assistance programs. While the criterion for determining eligibility may vary from program to program, the objective that only eligible individuals or organizations participate is consistent across all federal programs, which forms {{the basis of this}} compliance requirement. To comply with this objective, recipients must first assure that proper eligibility determinations are made, which means that the recipient must determine the parameters and limitations to define eligibility for a specific program in accordance with the program’s purpose. Many federal programs already contain eligibility requirements based on laws, agency regulations, <b>grant</b> <b>agreements,</b> etc., and recipients must assure that their eligibility determination complies with such requirements. An example includes federal programs that offer HIV/Aids treatment and require that the participants be victims of such diseases. It is usually the recipient’s responsibility to determine how to determine such eligibility, such as establishing policy that requires an in-house doctor or laboratory to diagnose each prospective participant, accepting diagnoses from third-party doctors or laboratories, etc. However, certain agencies have included specific parameters for which the recipient should follow, {{as in the case of}} the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) which states in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) that recipients of certain HUD housing subsidy programs must obtain specific income verification documents to prove participant [...] eligibility, such as W-2 payroll forms, a federal income tax return, etc.|$|E

The Phononic and Photonic {{nanostructures}} (P 2 N) group {{investigates the}} interaction of photons, phonons and electrons in nanoscale condensed matter underpinn ed by research in nanofabrication and nanometrology. Its long term aim is to develop new information technology concepts where information processing is achieved with multiple state variables. The P 2 N group research on nanoscale thermal transport impacts thermal management in nanoelectronics. Similarly, the optical studies of acoustic effects in confined and phononic systems explores the limits of couple state-variables. The technology-oriented work on exciton-plasmon coupling printed polymer-based photonic structures targets enhanced light extraction from light sources, while the quest for novel nanometrology paves the way for future standards in nanotechnology. Finally. self- assembly research is oriented to pushing the limits of lithography while simultan eously enabling new functions for Beyond CMOS.

5000|$|Programs {{administer}} assistance by “granting” or “awarding” {{a portion}} of the assistance to recipients. These are called Federal grants or awards. Recipients must first apply for the award directly to the federal agency that administers the program. The agency must then determine the amount of assistance to be awarded and notifies the recipient of the award. To be official, an award requires a contract or <b>grant</b> <b>agreements</b> between the agency and the recipient that details the use of the award and restrictions and limitations. [...] Federal awards may specify a time period during which the recipient may use the assistance. This is called the Period of Availability of Federal Funds. Most grants have a term of one year (although some may have a longer lifespan, even indefinitely), and the recipient must use the assistance within that timeframe. This is done because federal assistance is tied to the federal government’s budget process, and any funds not used by a recipient within the specified time limit is reverted to other uses. [...] As a condition of receiving Federal awards or grants, recipients must agree to comply with the applicable laws and regulations related to the program and its agency, as well as any provisions included in the contracts and <b>grant</b> <b>agreements</b> entered between the recipient and the agency. Failure to do so may lead to sanctions, including fines and penalties, exclusion or suspension from participating in federal assistance programs and activities, and/or criminal charges. Most federal program regulations for which agencies and recipients must always comply are compiled in the Code of Federal Regulations, with summaries and guidance for these regulations contained in OMB Circular letters.|$|E
