During her first week at Kenilworth Junior High, she was bullied {{by a group of}} her peers who mistook her for an effeminate, scrawny boy. [...] "I was wearing an old Salvation Army shop boy’s suit. As I went to the {{bathroom}} I heard people saying, ‘Hey, faggot’. They slammed my head into a locker. I fell to the ground and they started to kick the shit out of me. I had to have stitches. The school <b>kicked</b> <b>me</b> out, not the bullies... Years later, I went to a coffee shop and I ran into one of the girls who’d <b>kicked</b> <b>me,</b> and she said, ‘Winona, Winona, can I have your autograph?’ And I said, ‘Do you remember me? Remember in seventh grade you beat up that kid?’ And she said, ‘Kind of’. And I said, ‘That was me. Go fuck yourself.’" [...] As a result, Ryder ended up being home-schooled that year.|$|E

500|$|Gaven {{was born}} as Marcia Mitzman on February 28, 1959 in New York City, New York. She was raised {{with her two}} {{siblings}} {{in the village of}} Hastings-on-Hudson, New York by their mother Patricia Mitzman, who had previously had a career in art. Newt Mitzman, their father, directed [...] television specials and commercials for a living. Gaven went to Hackley Elementary School in Tarrytown, New York when she was young. At that time she was certain that she wanted to work in show business. As the result of a lie, she was able to study at the High School of Performing Arts even though the school was only open to inhabitants of New York City. She then became a drama major at the State University of New York at Purchase, though she did not get a degree. She said in a 1987 interview with The New York Times that [...] "they <b>kicked</b> <b>me</b> out because I missed a major rehearsal", and she never applied for readmission since she had already made her first appearance on Broadway in Grease by then. While at Purchase, Gaven performed in student productions such as The Taming of the Shrew and Trumpets and Drums.|$|E
500|$|Don't take it {{personally}} was chosen as a [...] "freeware game pick" [...] by IndieGames's Michael Rose, who {{said that it was}} worth playing through multiple times in order to see the different paths the story takes depending on the player's choices. The Daily Telegraph gave the visual novel the award for [...] "Best Script" [...] in its video game awards of 2011, stating that [...] "Love's layered narrative of a high school teacher embroiled in his student's worries goes places most mainstream video games wouldn't dare." [...] Pete Davidson of GamePro noted the game {{as an example of the}} [...] "creativity" [...] missing in many large-budget titles, and praised the story, calling Love [...] "a writer first and a game developer second." [...] Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun described the game as [...] "a game about love, sex and the internet" [...] that was [...] "capable of being profoundly moving" [...] and was about [...] "what it is to feel like someone's <b>kicked</b> <b>me</b> straight in the heart". He praised Love's ability to use dialogue to effect an emotional response, though he noted that the game seemed to lose some of its impact in the final chapters and felt that the use of the [...] "12chan" [...] threads as a Greek chorus was [...] "perhaps a meta-layer too far".|$|E

500|$|The {{deciding}} Game 7 of the 2015 Finals {{was scheduled}} to be played at 7:00 PM on April 30, 2015 at the WFCU Centre in Windsor, Ontario. The Express shootaround was set to take place before that of the Rainmen. The road team was supposed to arrive for warm-ups at approximately 1:00 PM, but entered the stadium approximately two hours earlier. Express assistant coach Gerry Brumpton recounted, [...] "They snuck in here before they even had the light on. We were here in the dark, I opened up the curtain and I looked in and there they were. They were still here working out. So they had been here for a while." [...] The Express told their opponents to leave the arena, but they refused, with one Rainmen player dunking a basketball instead. Windsor's Bill Jones then attempted to take a ball from Halifax center Liam McMorrow, but the player [...] "flinched," [...] pretending to throw a punch. According to Rainmen player Forrest Fisher, Jones tackled McMorrow to the ground and Express guard Tony Bennett followed up by hitting McMorrow with a chair. Referring to the Rainmen, Jones said, [...] "A couple of them <b>kicked</b> <b>me</b> and tried to take swings at me. And my players were there and they came to my rescue {{to be able to get}} me up." [...] Soon the violence escalated, with staff members and players from both teams involved. At around 10:40 AM, Windsor police received a phone call [...] "that between 15 to 20 men were involved in an altercation." [...] By the time they arrived at the WFCU Centre, however, the fighting was over and the Rainmen players had already reached their team bus.|$|E

2500|$|Bright {{became friends}} with Tim DuBois, head of Arista Records in Nashville, who {{was not only a}} label {{executive}} but a creative-type person whom Bright naturally related to as a fellow [...] "song junkie". The two enjoyed playing songs for each other and analyzing them critically, leading DuBois to recognize Bright's keen insight into what makes a commercially good song. DuBois had under contract three musicians whom he suggested work together rather than go for separate careers. The new trio was named [...] "BlackHawk" [...] and consisted of Henry Paul, Dave Robbins, and Van Stephenson. They had recorded several songs, but DuBois was not happy with their sound and he asked Bright to spend time with them {{to come up with something}} with more commercial appeal. Bright collaborated with the band on intensive rehearsal sessions in a basement studio over several months, coming up with a bluegrass-type sound but with rock guitars, blending a mandolin and close vocal harmonies. Bright thought the sound was a [...] "game changer". DuBois agreed and was willing to give Bright his first job as producer. Bright's production of BlackHawk's first single, [...] "Goodbye Says It All" [...] was released in 1993 and reached number 11 on the Billboard Country charts. Their next four songs were even more successful, all reaching the top ten. BlackHawk eventually sold over four million albums. Over a 12 year span Bright had ascended from the tape room to Vice President of EMI Publishing. With this extraordinary success, Bright said, [...] "I thought I was king of the world". His success did not last. The next four acts he produced were failures and he was subsequently terminated by EMI. Bright stated [...] "God <b>kicked</b> <b>me</b> back down the ladder[...] [...] it was the worst thing in my life at that time." [...] Later, EMI's then competitor, Sony/ATV approached Bright with a joint venture giving him his own publishing company, a production deal, and seed money for a management deal. He accepted, and with associate Marty Williams, co-founded the publishing company Teracel Music.|$|E
