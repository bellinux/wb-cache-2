2500|$|Automixers can be {{oriented}} toward live reinforcement application or permanent installation {{with varying degrees}} of connector type (XLR or block) and feature switches and channel potentiometers located internally or externally. Channel switches permit the user to vary sensitivity (dynamic mic, condenser mic, or line), phantom power, priority, and always on-or-auto mode ("on" [...] being useful for uninterrupted music playback). Auto mixers are frequently configured in board rooms, but are also useful in theatrical and [...] "town hall" [...] events where several wireless microphones are in use. Auto mixers may be connected directly to wired mics and wireless mic receivers, or may be connected to the channel <b>direct</b> <b>output</b> or send jacks of a mixing console. Integration of an auto mixer with manual mixing console permits more precise input gain control, absolute mic muting, low cut filter, equalization and individual mic channel foldback control.|$|E

Two sets of direction selective cells, one in layer 4 B, {{and the other in}} layer 6, send parallel <b>direct</b> <b>outputs</b> to area MT in the dorsal cortical stream. We show that these two outputs carry different types of spatial information. Direction selective cells in layer 4 B have smaller receptive fields than those in layer 6, and layer 4 B cells are more selective for orientation. We present evidence for a third direction selective pathway that flows through V 1 layers 4 Cm (the middle tier of layer 4 C) to layer 3. Cells in layer 3 are very selective for orientation, have the smallest receptive fields in V 1, and send <b>direct</b> <b>outputs</b> to area V 2. Layer 3 neurons are well suited to contribute to detection and recognition of small objects by the ventral cortical stream, as well as to sense subtle motions within objects, such as changes in facial expressions...|$|R

The photonic structure preserves the high spin coherence of single-crystal diamond (T 2 ≳ 100 μ s). The single-photon count rate approaches a megahertz facilitating efficient spin readout. We thus demonstrate a key enabling technology for quantum applications such as high-sensitivity magnetometry and long-distance spin entanglement...|$|R
