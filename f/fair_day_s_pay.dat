But still there remains that question, Is not a <b>fair</b> <b>day's</b> work worth a <b>fair</b> <b>day's</b> wages? This man did work hard--at a task perhaps the hardest of any that a man may do; and for ten years he earned some seventy pounds a year. Will any one say that he {{received}} fair wages for his fair work, let him be married or single? And yet there are so many who would fain pay their clergy, if they only knew how to apply their money! But that is a long subject, as Mr. Robarts had told Miss Dunstable.
