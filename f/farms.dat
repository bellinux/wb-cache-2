5|$|In {{the final}} decades of this era many plebeians grew poorer. The long {{military}} campaigns had forced citizens {{to leave their}} <b>farms</b> to fight, while their <b>farms</b> fell into disrepair. The landed aristocracy began buying bankrupted <b>farms</b> at discounted prices. As commodity prices fell, many farmers could no longer operate their <b>farms</b> at a profit. The result was the ultimate bankruptcy of countless farmers. Masses of unemployed plebeians soon began to flood into Rome, and thus {{into the ranks of}} the legislative assemblies. Their poverty usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered them the most. A new culture of dependency was emerging, in which citizens would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E
5|$|Many {{places in}} Norway <b>farms</b> also {{maintained}} mountain <b>farms</b> (seter/støl), where cows, goats, and sheep would put out to pasture {{during the summer}} months. These would typically include a small dwelling house and a dairy for making and storing cheese, sour cream, etc.|$|E

50|$|The {{most widely}} used -ville toponyms are {{combined}} with either a male name or an adjective: Amfreville (Asfridr′s <b>farm),</b> Auzouville (Asulfr′s <b>farm),</b> Beuzeville (Bosi′s <b>farm),</b> Colleville (Koli′s <b>farm),</b> Épreville (Sprot′s <b>farm),</b> Sotteville (Soti′s <b>farm),</b> Tocqueville (Toki′s <b>farm),</b> Touffreville (Thorfridr′s <b>farm),</b> Tourville (Thori′s <b>farm),</b> Trouville (Thorold′s <b>farm),</b> Grainville (Grimr′s <b>farm),</b> Bretteville (Briton's <b>farm)</b> and Englesqueville or Anglesqueville (English <b>farm).</b> These toponyms do not exist in France outside of Normandy, because their first element is a Scandinavian personal name or an adjective marking they came from Great-Britain, together with Anglo-Scandinavian farmers. In addition some typical Celtic male′s names {{can be found in}} Doncanville (Duncan′s <b>farm),</b> Quinéville or Quenneville (Kenneth′s <b>farm),</b> Néville (Niall′s <b>farm).</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{collectivization}} {{efforts in}} the 1930s led to the concentration of the reindeer herds in kolkhozes (collective <b>farms),</b> which, in turn, were further consolidated into a few large-scale state <b>farms</b> in the late 1950s–early 1970s. By the mid-1970s, the state <b>farms</b> were further consolidated into just two, based in Lovozero and Krasnoshchelye. The consolidations were rationalized by the necessity to isolate the herders from the military installations, {{as well as by}} the need to flood some territories to construct hydroelectric plants.|$|E
5|$|The final {{decades of}} this era saw a {{worsening}} economic situation for many Plebeians. The long military campaigns had forced citizens {{to leave their}} <b>farms,</b> which often caused those <b>farms</b> to fall {{into a state of}} disrepair. This situation was made worse during the Second Punic War, when Hannibal fought the Romans throughout Italy, and the Romans adopted a strategy of attrition and guerrilla warfare in response. When the soldiers returned from the battlefield, they often had to sell their <b>farms</b> to pay their debts, and the landed aristocracy quickly bought these <b>farms</b> at discounted prices. The wars had also brought to Rome a great surplus of inexpensive slave labor, which the landed aristocrats used to staff their new <b>farms.</b> Soon the masses of unemployed Plebeians began to flood into Rome, and into the ranks of the legislative assemblies.|$|E
5|$|There were 801 <b>farms</b> in Juniata County in 1997, {{occupying a}} total of 96,312 acres of farmland. By 2002, there were only 644 <b>farms</b> and 86,203 acres of farmland.|$|E

5|$|Wind <b>farms</b> {{consist of}} many {{individual}} wind turbines which {{are connected to}} the electric power transmission network. Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electric power, competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants. Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land, and offshore <b>farms</b> have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher. Small onshore wind <b>farms</b> can feed some energy into the grid or provide electric power to isolated off-grid locations.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture in Wales {{is heavily}} subsidised by the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy with farmers getting annual {{payments}} {{for the area}} they farm. A new scheme was announced in 2014; after a transitional period lasting until 2019, lowland <b>farms</b> will receive almost £200 per hectare while <b>farms</b> in disadvantaged areas will receive £166. The total payment for Wales between 2014 and 2020 will be £1,870 million, but some of this (15%) {{will be used for}} rural development projects.|$|E

5|$|Although the UK Government has set {{a target}} of 10% for the {{proportion}} of the UK's electricity produced by renewable energy by 2010, wind power in the UK {{has a long history of}} controversy, with an average approval rate for planning permission of only 28% for onshore wind <b>farms.</b> Scout Moor was first identified as an excellent site for a wind farm in 2001. Peel Holdings commissioned market research consultants MORI to undertake a telephone poll over seventeen days in 2002, soliciting the opinions of residents in Bury, Rossendale and Rochdale about wind <b>farms</b> in general and Scout Moor in particular. The results showed that 88% of respondents thought wind <b>farms</b> were a very or fairly good idea, 72% thought the Scout Moor project was a very or fairly good idea, and 63% stated wind power as the preferred energy source.|$|E
5|$|Although {{wind power}} is a popular form of energy generation, the {{construction}} of wind <b>farms</b> is not universally welcomed, often for aesthetic reasons.|$|E
5|$|As of December 2010, South Australia had {{thirteen}} operational wind <b>farms,</b> with an {{installed capacity}} of 1,018 MW. By August 2014 this has increased to 1,473 MW, accounting for 27 per cent of electricity production. As of late 2015 {{there are a}} large range of new wind <b>farms</b> {{in various stages of}} planning but only one under construction, the Hornsdale Wind Farm.

5|$|Brezhnev's {{agricultural}} policy reinforced the conventional methods for organising the collective <b>farms.</b> Output quotas {{continued to be}} imposed centrally. Khrushchev's policy of amalgamating <b>farms</b> was continued by Brezhnev, because he shared Khrushchev's belief that bigger kolkhozes would increase productivity. Brezhnev pushed {{for an increase in}} state investments in farming, which mounted to an all-time high in the 1970s of 27% of all state investment– this figure did not include investments in farm equipment. In 1981 alone, 33 billion U.S. dollars (by contemporary exchange rate) was invested into agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{upon the}} size and {{economic}} well-being of the farm, there might also be a feast hall (oppstue), a house for the retired farmers (føderådstue), farm hands' dormitory (drengstue), carriage house (vognskjul), and even distillery (brenneskur). Smaller, poorer <b>farms</b> might combine barns and dwelling houses, have simpler storage areas, and use the facilities of other <b>farms</b> for activities {{they could not afford}} to build houses for.|$|E
5|$|Effects {{are not all}} negative; for example, wind <b>farms</b> produce {{renewable}} energy, {{helping to}} mitigate the single greatest threat to birds, climate change. But, especially if wind <b>farms</b> are poorly sited, they may affect bird populations through disturbance, direct or indirect habitat loss, and collisions. Well sited wind <b>farms</b> benefit birds; poorly sited ones can kill many birds in collisions. For example, at the Altamont Pass in California, the golden eagle has been reduced by 80%, and nesting has ceased in the area. Thus, there is a trade-off in the siting of any wind farm.|$|E

5|$|Farm incomes {{have fallen}} {{over the years}} as a result of cheap food {{policies}} in the United Kingdom, the lowering of world commodity prices and the removal of production-based subsidies. Particularly hard hit have been the incomes of hill <b>farms</b> in Wales which averaged £15,000 in 2014, as against £23,000 for lowland livestock <b>farms</b> and £59,000 for dairy <b>farms.</b> The labour force has been dwindling for many years as a result of increased mechanisation and changes in farming practices. Fewer farmers are needed today because they are able to produce more food from their land. Hay is no longer the main source of winter feed for livestock and has largely been replaced by silage, particularly baled silage wrapped in film that can be handled mechanically. This has reduced the manpower needed on <b>farms,</b> and there has been an increase of use by farmers of specialised contractors who provide services in silage making, harvesting and fencing. Another problem facing Welsh farmers is their distance from the main distribution centres used by supermarkets which are mostly located near centres of population in England.|$|E
