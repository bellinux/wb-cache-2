500|$|Each ten foot {{diameter}} balloon {{was filled}} with one-third oxygen and two-thirds hydrogen. To do this, the empty balloon was {{spread out on the}} ground with plenty of room around it. It was then attached to a hose to start filling with oxygen gas. The other end of the hose went to a retort that {{was filled with}} chlorinate of potassium and a small amount of manganese oxide. The retort was heated to a high temperature through a gasoline burner. Oxygen gas, generated at 600 cubic <b>feet</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> went through a lime-water wash and from there to fill the balloon. The balloon was filled up one third of the way. The hose was then connected to the hydrogen gas generator and filled up the remaining two-thirds of the way. The oxygen and hydrogen balloon was referred to as an [...] "oxy-hydrogen" [...] balloon. Each gas had an electric fuse detonator inside, which made it a type of [...] "bomb" [...] when triggered electrically. Wires were used that led from the ground to the balloon and when an electrical charge was made by a dynamo, it passed through the wires to set off the detonator causing an explosion that was brighter than the sun. This caused the oxygen and hydrogen to react, creating water (H2O). This man-made water then acted as a nucleus for making rain out of the atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|The {{demise of}} Linn City {{came as a}} {{surprise}} over several months in 1861. During October a heavy and constant rain began to fall. Though heavy rains during October in Oregon are not out of the ordinary, the rain that continued into November was. By the end of November, the Willamette River overflowed its banks. By December, the water had risen over some of the town's streets. Citizens watched, helpless, from their windows as the water rose at a rate of nearly one <b>foot</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour.</b> The resulting great flood destroyed Linn City. The walls of the houses and stores began to shudder and cave in. Other buildings were picked up and swept away by the powerful deluge. When the flood ended on December 14, only three homes remained standing in Linn City.|$|R

Yet the use of oxygen was considered so unsportsmanlike that none {{of the rest of the}} Alpine world recognised this high ascent rate. George Mallory himself described the use of such oxygen as unsportsmanlike, but he later concluded that it would be impossible for him to summit without it and consequently used it on his final attempt in 1924.

[...] For the next twenty-five years, bottled oxygen was considered standard for any successful summit.|$|E
40|$|Project {{conducted}} {{in cooperation with}} the Federal Highway Administration. Crack sealing is a hazardous, costly, and labor-intensive operation. In North America, approximately $ 200 million is spent each year on crack sealing. Prompted by concerns of safety and cost, The University of Texas at Austin, in cooperation with TxDOT and the Federal Highway Administration, has developed a unique computer-guided automated road maintenance machine (ARMM) for pavement crack sealing. The current ARMM prototype, first developed in 1997, was significantly upgraded this year (1999). The main upgrades included a new aluminum gantry to replace the older steel one; a computer system, which meets industrial requirements; and a new, spring-loaded turret design. This prototype has been thoroughly tested in field trials {{conducted in}} Texas and in nine other states. The prototype’s productivity was also measured during controlled experiments. These experiments demonstrated that the device is able to seal 0. 67 miles per workday or 444 linear <b>feet</b> of cracks <b>per</b> <b>hour.</b> The optimum sealing productivity possible with the current prototype was also estimated at 2. 32 miles per workday or 765 linear <b>feet</b> of cracks <b>per</b> <b>hour.</b> With futur...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{number of}} sawmills {{in the coastal}} lumber-producing area of British Columbia diminished from 364 In 1955 to 162 in 1968. In the {{interior}} of the province the reduction in plant numbers was from 2125 to 740. Over the same period lumber production in the province increased from 4. 9 billion to 7. 8 billion board feet, so the trend was to fewer plants of larger capacity per plant. When sawmills were grouped into eight-hour capacity classes, an application of the survivor principle, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, two-sample statistical test, indicated that there was a significant (p =. 05) difference in the distribution of sawmills on the coast for the years 1955 and 1968. In {{the interior of the}} province the difference in the distribution of sawmills for those two years was highly significant (p =. 01). The inference is that in both regions some plants were more economically viable than others over that period of time. The greatest reduction in plant numbers on the coast occurred in capacities of 50 thousand board <b>feet</b> and less <b>per</b> eight <b>hours,</b> whereas the number of sawmills over 90 thousand board <b>feet</b> <b>per</b> eight <b>hours</b> increased, despite a drop of over 200 in total number of mills on the coast. In the interior, the greatest reduction in plant numbers was in the 20 thousand board <b>feet</b> and less <b>per</b> eight <b>hours</b> class. The most efficient plant sizes in the interior, on the basis of survival criteria, encompassed a wide range of capacities in excess of 40 thousand board <b>feet</b> <b>per</b> eight <b>hours.</b> In 25 of 27 sawmills studied there was a statistically significant relationship between productivity and log size. The relationship was variable, but, in most cases, productivity increased as log size increased. Therefore sawmill capacity, when defined as lumber output per unit time, is a function of log size. Because of this, and the fact that not all sawmills can process all log sizes, the sawmills studied were divided into three groups, with a distinct log population for each group, for analysis of short [...] and long-run cost curves. The available evidence on costs of labour, power and materials and supplies indicates that the short-run cost curves for these plants diminish to plant capacity, if log costs are constant and decreases in power costs per unit for two-and-three shift operations are greater than increases in labour costs per unit. Evidence on costs of management and fixed plant further indicates that the long-run cost curve diminishes with Increasing plant scale over the range of scale studied in each group of plants. Although increasing economies of production occurred with increasing plant scale for the groups of mills studied, factors affecting the sawmill investment decision may be associated with some uncertainty. The theory of decision-making under uncertainty provides a framework for analysing such investment problems. The application of this theory to the small-log mill group studied indicated that the optimum strategy, based on return on investment criteria, depended on the probable supply of small logs to be expected {{over the life of the}} investment. The methodology of modern decision-making theory facilitates investment analysis where there are several chance events which may affect the decision; thus it is suggested that this methodology he more widely used in sawmill investment analysis...|$|R
