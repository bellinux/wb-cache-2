I need not trouble you with the dangers which they ran, or with the privations which they endured. Suffice it that to disguise themselves they had to take the clothes of two peasants, whom they waylaid in a wood. Hiding by day and travelling by night, they had got as far into France as Remilly, and were within a mile--a single mile, captain--of crossing the German lines when a patrol of Uhlans came right upon them.

5000|$|Kierkegaard {{repeats the}} {{synthesis}} again in The Sickness Unto Death [...] and he tied {{it to his}} idea of the [...] "Moment" [...] from Philosophical Fragments. He says, [...] "For the Greeks, the eternal lies behind as the past {{that can only be}} entered backwards. The category I maintain should be kept in mind, repetition, by which eternity is entered forwards." [...] Kierkegaard wrote Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits in 1847. He said, [...] "A Providence watches over each man’s wandering through life. It provides him with two guides. The one calls him forward. The other calls him back. They are, however, not in opposition to each other, these two guides, nor do they leave the wanderer standing there in doubt, confused by the <b>double</b> <b>call.</b> Rather the two are in eternal understanding with each other. For the one beckons forward to the Good, the other calls man back from evil. These guides are called repentance and remorse. The eager traveler hurries forward to the new, to the novel, and, indeed, away from experience. But the remorseful one, who comes behind, laboriously gathers up experience. Kierkegaard also mentions this idea in his Journals. He wrote: [...] "It is quite true what philosophy says; that life must be understood backwards. But then one forgets the other principle: that it must be lived forwards. Which principle, the more one thinks it through, ends exactly with the thought that temporal life can never properly be understood precisely because I can at no instant find complete rest in which to adopt a position: backwards.|$|E
5000|$|Introducing {{the ethical}} stage it is {{moreover}} unclear if Kierkegaard acknowledges an ethical stage without religion. Freedom seems to denote {{freedom to choose}} the will {{to do the right}} and to denounce the wrong in a secular, almost Kantian style. However, remorse (angeren) seems to be a religious category specifically related to the Christian concept of deliverance. Moreover, Kierkegaard is constant in his point of view that each single individual can become conscious of a higher self than the externally visible human self and embrace the spiritual self in [...] "an eternal understanding". [...] In a spiritual sense that by which a person gives birth is the formative striving of the will and that is within a person’s own power. What are you afraid of then? After all, you are not supposed to give birth to another human being; you are supposed to give birth only to yourself. And yet I am fully aware that there is an earnestness about this that shakes the entire soul; to become conscious in one’s eternal validity is a moment that is more significant than everything else in the world. It is as if you were captivated and entangled and could never escape either in time or in eternity; it is as if you lost yourself, as if you ceased to be; it is as if you would repent of it the next moment and yet it cannot be undone. It is an earnest and significant moment when a person links himself to an eternal power for an eternity, when he accepts himself as the one whose remembrance time will never erase, when in an eternal and unerring sense he becomes conscious of himself as the person he is. Judge Vilhelm, Either/Or II p. 206 Hong 1987 [...] The self that is the objective is not only a personal self but a social, a civic self. He then possesses himself as a task in an activity whereby he engages in the affairs of life as this specific personality. Here his task is not to form himself but to act, and yet he forms himself at the same time, because, as I noted above, the ethical individual lives {{in such a way that}} he is continually transferring himself from one stage to another. Søren Kierkegaard, Either/Or II p. 262-263 [...] A Providence watches over each man’s wandering through life. It provides him with two guides. The one calls him forward. The other calls him back. They are, however, not in opposition to each other, these two guides, nor do they leave the wanderer standing there in doubt, confused by the <b>double</b> <b>call.</b> Rather the two are in eternal understanding with each other. For the one beckons forward to the Good, the other calls man back from evil. …. The two guides call out to a man early and late, and when he listens to their call, then he finds his way, then he can know where he is, on the way. Because these two calls designate the place and show the way. Of these two, the call of remorse is perhaps the best. For the eager traveler who travels lightly along the way does not, in this fashion, learn to know it as well as a wayfarer with a heavy burden. The one who merely strives to get on does not learn to know the way as well as the remorseful man. The eager traveler hurries forward to the new, to the novel, and, indeed, away from experience. But the remorseful one, who comes behind, laboriously gathers up experience.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we give more {{insights}} {{on the security}} of blockcipherbased hash functions. We give a very simple criterion to build a secure large class of Single-Block-Length (SBL) or <b>double</b> <b>call</b> Double-Block-Length (DBL) compression functions based on (kn, n) blockciphers, where kn is the key length and n is the block length and k is an integer. This criterion is simpler than previous works in the literature. Based on the criterion, we can get many results from this criterion, {{and we can get}} a conclusion on such class of blockcipher-based hash functions. We solved the open problem left by Hirose. Our results show that to build a secure <b>double</b> <b>call</b> DBL compression function, it is required k> = m + 1 where m is the number of message blocks. Thus, we can only build rate 1 / 2 secure double DBL blockcipher-based compression functions if k = = 2. At last, we pointed out flaws in Stam’s theorem about supercharged functions and gave a revision of this theorem and added another condition for the security of supercharged compression functions. ...|$|E

40|$|In a {{competitive}} electricity market traditional {{demand side management}} options offering customers curtailable service at reduced rates are replaced by voluntary customer responses to electricity spot prices. In this new environment, customers wishing to ensure a fixed electricity price while taking advantage of their flexibility to curtail loads can do so by purchasing a forward electricity contract bundled with a financial option that provides a hedge against price risk and reflects the &quot;real options &quot; available to the customer. This paper describes a particular financial instrument {{referred to as a}} &quot;double call &quot; option and derives the value of that option under the assumption that forward electricity prices behave as a geometric Brownian motion process. It is shown that a forward contract bundled with an appropriate <b>double</b> <b>call</b> option provides a &quot;perfect hedge &quot; for customers that can curtail loads in response to high spot prices and can mitigate their curtailment losses when the curtailment decision is made with sufficient lead time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Security proofs are an {{essential}} part of modern cryptography. Often the challenge is not to come up with appropriate schemes but rather to technically prove that these satisfy the desired security properties. We provide for the first time techniques for proving asymptotically optimal preimage resistance bounds for block cipher based double length, <b>double</b> <b>call</b> hash functions. More precisely, we consider for some ℓ> n compression functions H: { 0, 1 } ℓ+n → { 0, 1 } 2 n using two calls to an ideal block cipher with an n-bit block size. Optimally, an adversary trying to find a preimage for H should require Ω(2 2 n) queries to the underlying block cipher. As a matter of fact there have been several attempts to prove the preimage resistance of such compression functions, but no proof did go beyond the Ω(2 n) barrier, therefore leaving a huge gap when compared to the optimal bound. In this paper, we introduce two new techniques on how to lift this bound to Ω(2 2 n). We demonstrate our new techniques for a simple and natural design of H, being the concatenation of two instances of the well-known Davies-Meyer compression function...|$|E
40|$|This study {{responds}} to a <b>double</b> <b>call.</b> Firstly, {{it aims to}} develop an empirical and pedagogical perspective on the integration of language and literature teaching. Secondly, it attempts to construct a language awareness (LA) assessment tool {{to keep pace with}} developments in reading. To this end, the study investigates {{the extent to which a}} stylistic exploration of Shakespeare's language can enhance EFL students' language awareness, which is defined for the present purpose in terms of a number of stylistic devices (e. g. metaphor) which potentially contribute to the 'literariness' of a text. Pedagogical materials and activities were designed accordingly in order to raise awareness of a group of 22 Taiwanese university students over a 10 -week period of intervention. Extracts from Shakespeare's sonnets and plays were used as the medium to sensitise students to various linguistic devices and their literary functions. Further non-Shakespearean materials, both literary and non-literary (e. g. advertisements, newspaper headlines, political speeches) were drawn upon as backup resources to consolidate the stylistic exploration done in the classroom. At the end of the course, students' LA development is demonstrated qualitatively in their course diaries, quantitatively in the researcher-developed LA Test, and different forms of questionnaires students filled in. The study concludes with suggestions regarding the refinement of assessment tools, with implications for future research into the scholarship of teaching...|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} recent calls to {{transform}} VET and to transform development. This <b>double</b> <b>call</b> {{leads us to}} ask: how can skills development best support development that is sustainable for individuals, communities and the planet, whilst promoting social justice and poverty reduction? In considering this question we critique the idea of green skills for the green economy as being inadequate for achieving a transformed and transformative VET that shifts the target from economic growth {{to the well-being of}} individuals, and that enables vocational education {{to play a role in}} challenging and transforming society and work. Rather, we argue that we must see human development and sustainable development as inseparable, and plan and evaluate VET for its contribution to these. Such an approach must be grounded in a view of work, and hence skills for work, that is decent, life-enhancing, solidaristic, environmentally-sensitive and intergenerationally-aware. It must confront the reality that much current VET is complicit in preparing people for work that lacks some or all of these characteristics. It must be concerned with poverty, inequality and injustice and contribute to their eradication. It must be supportive of individuals’ agency, whilst also reflecting a careful reading of the structures that too often constrain them. In doing all this it must minimise the costs and risks of any transformation for the poor and seek to lock them into better individual and collective lives, not out of them. Finally, it must transform skills, work and the world in ways that are truly sustainable of the people of today but also those who are to inhabit the earth tomorrow...|$|E
