25|$|Granholm was {{the heavy}} {{favourite}} {{in the general}} election, boasting strong support from working women, African-Americans and voters under 30 years of age. She campaigned on her record on crime and was seen as more charismatic than Posthumous. Despite the 2002 elections being a <b>good</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> Republicans nationwide, who gained control of the U.S. Senate and increased their hold on the U.S. House, Granholm went on to defeat Posthumus by 1,633,796 votes (51.42%) to 1,506,104 (47.40%).|$|E

25|$|In 2007 the {{economic}} environment remained conducive to further growth of banking activity in Morocco following a very <b>good</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> the sector in 2006. In 2007 macroeconomic growth, excluding the agricultural sector, remained quite robust, providing the background for dynamic growth in banking credits. Total {{assets of the}} banking sector increased by 21.6% to MAD 654.7 billion ($85.1 billion), which is above the previous year's high annual growth rate of 18.1%. The structure of the domestic sector has remained steady {{in the past two}} years, with the landscape dominated by three major local banks. The state has started to remove itself from the domestic sector by surrendering part of its share capital in public banks. At end-2007 public capital still held controlling stakes in five banks and four financing companies. Meanwhile, foreign ownership in the local financial sector continues to grow, with foreign institutions controlling five banks and eight financing companies as well as holding significant stakes in four banks and three financing companies.|$|E

500|$|After being {{nominated}} for awards {{such as the}} Golden Globes, Critics' Choice, and Writers Guild of America, Deadpool was considered a serious contender for several Academy Awards despite its content and tone, including potential nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and, after its Producers Guild of America nomination, Best Picture. When the film did not receive any Academy Award nominations, it was widely considered to have been [...] "". Analyzing potential reasons for this, Screen Rant's Alex Leadbeater said that though the film [...] "earned a solid thumbs up from most", it was generally not praised by top critics for offering any [...] "depth or related subversion of its genre." [...] He also noted an apparent bias that Academy voters' have against superhero films; {{the lack of a}} targeted campaign for the awards by Fox, who {{did not seem to be}} expecting any of the film's previous awards either; and the large amount of other films in contention, as [...] "2016 was, all in all, a pretty <b>good</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> movies".

500|$|In each of {{the four}} seasons from 1922 to 1925, Yorkshire won the County Championship. Rhodes scored over 1,000 runs each year, {{averaging}} over 30 except in 1924; in 1925 his average was 40.91, only the second time it exceeded 40 in an English cricket season. Rhodes, by now part of a very powerful county bowling attack, was usually the fourth or fifth bowler used. Although he imparted less spin to the ball than in his younger days, he continually bowled a good length and placed fielders in positions which very effectively blocked the scoring opportunities of the batsmen. He took over 100 wickets in 1922, 1923 and 1924, but took only 57 in 1925, a very <b>good</b> <b>year</b> <b>for</b> batting. As Yorkshire's senior professional Rhodes was very influential in this period. He cultivated a hostile attitude among the bowlers, directed the team tactically and raised its standard of fielding. Alan Hill wrote that Yorkshire captains (who were usually poor cricketers) generally deferred to Rhodes as senior professional; for example, Arthur Lupton, captain from 1925 to 1927, [...] "very wisely left the cricket affairs to the joint supervision of Rhodes and Emmott Robinson." [...] Stories emerged that he was an [...] "overmighty subject", arranging the positions of fielders and changing the bowler without reference to his nominal captain. In one story, Yorkshire had scored around 400. Lupton, hoping to score some easy runs, came out of the amateur dressing room with his bat when a young professional touched his arm and said, [...] "It's all right, sir. Mr Rhodes has declared [...]" [...] However, all the captains to whom biographer Sidney Rogerson spoke mentioned their good relations with Rhodes, although they agreed that he could be difficult. [...] Beverley Lyon, who captained Gloucestershire between 1929 and 1934, criticised Rhodes for insisting young professionals take the game seriously, thus promoting a no-risk attitude.|$|E

He also appeared in his third successive B Cup final, taking 2-19 as Kent beat Derbyshire. In August he was selected for Young England against the New Zealanders at Leicester, but had no success in his 19 overs. Jarvis's 1979 season, however, was not so successful as he failed to reach 40 first-class wickets.|$|E
