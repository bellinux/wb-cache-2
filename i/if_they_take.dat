They have to act this way, because of the co-operative relationships they necessarily have to work with in the division of labour. People have to conform to them, whether they like it or not. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>take</b> on a role, they have to fulfill the packet of tasks {{which is part of the}} job.|$|E

Some competitive skaters depend on income from shows.

25|$|Conspiring {{with his}} mentor Gilliam and second-in-command Edgar, Curtis Everett plans {{to lead the}} tail {{passengers}} in a revolt that will take {{them all the way}} up to the engine. Mason and armed guards come to take two small children, Andy and Timmy. Andy's father Andrew attempts to fight back, but is punished by Mason by being forced to put his arm into the extreme cold outside the train, effectively amputating it. Enraged, Curtis initiates their plan the next time they are to be fed, taking the security and prison cars. Curtis releases security expert Namgoong Minsu and his clairvoyant daughter Yona from the prison car so he can disable the locks between cars, offering them a hallucinogenic drug called Kronole as payment. They take the car where insects are ground up to make their protein bars, and Gilliam suggests that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>take</b> the subsequent water supply car, they will control any negotiation with Wilford. Instead, they are ambushed by a mass of masked men with hatchets led by Franco the Elder under Mason's orders; after a bloody battle Curtis sacrifices Edgar to win the fight. Mason is taken captive and Curtis, Namgoong, Yona, Tanya, Andrew and Gilliam's bodyguard Grey continue on with her as a hostage.|$|E
25|$|Following a brief hiatus, Janet {{returns to}} the team {{as a member of}} the Avengers Unity Squad. In {{addition}} to serving on the roster, she privately funds the team in order to avoid the problems that would come with government sponsorship. During the events of Inhumanity, Janet {{returns to the}} Microverse to rescue a family who has been pulled there through a newly awakened Inhuman's powers. There she confronts Gouzar once more, before returning to normal space. In the Avengers Unity Squad's fight with the Horsemen of Death, the Wasp defeats both the resurrected Banshee and Sentry, utilizing both her ability to grow to giant size as well as her ability to control insect life. After the team is defeated and the Earth destroyed, Wasp is the last surviving human and begins a romance with Havok (Alex Summers) with whom she has a daughter named Katie. Years later on Planet X, she is captured when she and Havok destroy a tachyon dam preventing time travel to their era. They are able to undo the destruction of Earth by forming an alliance with Kang and projecting their minds back into their past selves (physical time-travel still being impossible) but Kang takes their daughter to a place outside of time to 'protect' her from the changes in history, Kang subsequently attempts to use Katie as a hostage to force Havok to stop attacking him when he tries to take the Celestial power for himself, departing with Katie as his prisoner. Although Alex is left disfigured after the battle, he and Janet remain together. They are contacted by Immortus informing them that Immortus can return their daughter to them <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>take</b> action at the right time and place to conceive her, but he also warns them about the imminent threat posed by the Red Skull.|$|E

500|$|Forensic {{psychologist}} Eric Cullen {{and prison}} governor Tim Newell claim that prisoners face a throffer {{once they are}} told that they must acknowledge their guilt before they are offered parole or moved to an open prison. Cullen and Newell cite {{the example of a}} prisoner who falsely admitted guilt to move to an open prison; once there, however, he felt he could no longer lie about his guilt, and confessed to the prison's governor. He was subsequently transferred back to a maximum security prison. In the case of sex offenders, a throffer is presented when they are offered release <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>take</b> up treatment, but are threatened with extended sentences if they do not. Cullen and Newell are concerned about the predicament that these throffers present to prisoners, including those found innocent on appeal. Concerns surrounding throffers proposed to convicted sex offenders have also been discussed in print by Alex Alexandrowicz, himself wrongly imprisoned, and criminologist David Wilson. The latter observed the difficulties for those innocent people wrongly imprisoned who are faced with the throffer of having their sentence shortened if they [...] "acknowledge their guilt", but noted that, as perspectives of prisoners were rarely considered, the problem is usually not visible.|$|E
500|$|The Legendary Axe {{continued}} to receive praise from reviewers almost 20 {{years after its}} release. In {{a brief overview of}} the game in his overview of the TurboGrafx-16's history, IGN's Levi Buchanan pointed out that the game made the console [...] "an easy sell" [...] for buyers and showed the superior performance of the TurboGrafx-16 over the Nintendo Entertainment System. He said that The Legendary Axe [...] "made the NES look downright ancient". In a separate full review of the game, Buchanan noted that the game was an improvement over the console's pack-in game Keith Courage in Alpha Zones; he said that The Legendary Axe was more fun and had good action compared to the former. He noted that the game remained enjoyable almost 20 years after its release because of its simple platforming gameplay compared to more complicated modern video games like Mass Effect. He praised the game's smooth animation, innovative and detailed backgrounds, enemy designs, and soundtrack – saying that [...] "any classic game tune nerd would enjoy having [...] on their iPod". Allgame noted a change in the gameplay {{near the end of the}} game; after the fifth level, players must navigate a maze called the [...] "Pits of Madness" [...] which <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>take</b> the wrong path, they get sent back to its beginning.|$|E

Moreover, Longinus stresses that transgressive writers are not necessarily shameless fools, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>take</b> literary risks that seem [...] "bold, lawless, and original". As for social subjectivity, Longinus acknowledges that complete liberty promotes spirit and hope; according to Longinus, [...] "never did a slave become an orator". On the other hand, too much luxury and wealth leads to a decay in eloquence—eloquence being the goal of the sublime writer.|$|E
