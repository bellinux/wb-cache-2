50|$|In April 1980, Paramount (then {{owned by}} Gulf+Western), MCA/Universal Studios, Columbia Pictures and 20th Century Fox partnered with Getty Oil to jointly develop a pay cable service called Premiere. The {{proposed}} channel would have maintained exclusive first-run rights to newer feature films distributed {{by each of}} the studios (which would have aired nine months before to their initial telecasts on other premium channels), along with carrying films cherry-picked from other studios without any exclusivity. Displeased that the venture would likely give the four studios disproportionate control of the pay television marketplace, Time-Life, Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment and Viacom/TelePrompTer (the then respective owners of HBO, The Movie Channel and Showtime) to file an antitrust lawsuit against the studios with the U.S. Justice Department later that year. After reviewing the case, the Justice Department issued an injunction blocking Premiere's planned January 1, 1981 launch, deeming the venture to be an illegal boycott of the existing pay services that would subject them to possible financial damage if its presence resulted in price <b>fixing</b> <b>of</b> <b>film</b> titles. Paramount, MCA, Fox and Columbia decided to scrap the venture after the ruling was handed down.|$|R

40|$|Techniques are {{presented}} for obtaining time-resolved sequences of holograms and holographic interferograms {{of a shock}} wave impinging on a model in a shock tube. Several images are multiplexed on a single frame <b>of</b> <b>film</b> using a stationary, focused object beam and an angularly swept reference beam. At the reconstruction stage, the direction from which the reconstruction beam is shone determines which image is observed. In the original implementation, angular sweeping of the reference beam was achieved by {{the combination of a}} flat spinning mirror with a circular mirror that redirected the light on a <b>fixed</b> area <b>of</b> <b>film.</b> The holographic light source was a ruby laser, multiply Q- switched by a Pockels cell at rates of up to 20 thousand pulses a second. The method has been used to record either schlieren images or holographic interferograms of shock waves. Schlieren images of the phenomenon were holographically recorded by introducing an aperture at a focal point in the optical path of the object beam. Holographic interferograms were generated by overlaying two sequences on the same medium, one containing the phenomenon and the other the undisturbed field (reference exposure). The spinning mirror equipment is capable of recording sequences of some 10 frames at 50 µs separation, over a useful sweep angle of about 110 °. Proper timing of the sweep with respect to shock arrival was not assured with the original spinning mirro...|$|R

40|$|The normal {{coefficient}} of restitution (COR) for a spherical particle bouncing on a wet plane is investigated experimentally and {{compared with a}} model characterizing the energy loss at impact. For <b>fixed</b> ratios <b>of</b> liquid <b>film</b> thickness δ to particle diameter D, the wet COR is always found to decay linearly with St^- 1, where St, the Stokes number, measures the particle inertia {{with respect to the}} viscous force of the liquid. Such a dependency suggests a convenient way of predicting the wet COR with two fit parameters: A critical COR at infinitely large St and a critical St at zero COR. We characterize the dependency of the two parameters on δ/D and compare it with a model considering the energy loss from the inertia and the viscosity of the wetting liquid. This investigation suggests an analytical prediction of the COR for wet particles. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|Asymmetric {{hysteresis}} loops {{are generally}} found in exchange-coupled ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic layers or composite. Once {{the film is}} deposited the magnetization reversal behaviour becomes certain due to the <b>fixed</b> anisotropy <b>of</b> the <b>film.</b> We report an asymmetric magnetization reversal, which is erase/restorable in polycrystalline soft magnetic film. When the film is pre-saturated at a high field in the induced uniaxial easy direction, the asymmetric hysteresis loops with one branch governed by "coherent rotation" and another branch with kink induced by mixed reversal mechanism of "coherent rotation" and "rotation/ 180 degrees-domain-wall-motion/rotation" are obtained. If the film is presaturated in the induced hard axis, the kink disappears and "normal" hysteresis behaviour is observed instead. Such asymmetric magnetization curve can be restored if the film is pre-saturated in the easy axis again. The observed phenomenon is originated from an embedded second magnetically hard phase which tunes the anisotropy in the film. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. [[URL]...|$|R
40|$|The hybrid {{activated}} sludge-biofilm {{system called}} Integrated Fixed Film Activated Sludge (IFAS) has recently become popular for enhanced nitrification and denitrification in aerobic zones {{because it is}} an alternative to increasing the volume of treatment plant units to accomplish year round nitrification and nitrogen removal. Biomass is retained on the fixed-film media and remains in the aerobic reactor, thus increasing the effective mean cell resident time (MCRT) of the biomass and providing the temperature sensitive, slow growing nitrifiers a means of staying in the system when they otherwise would washout. While the utilization of media in aerobic zones to enhance nitrification and denitrification {{has been the subject of}} several studies and full-scale experiments, the effects and performances <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>film</b> media integrated into the anoxic zones of biological nutrient removal (BNR) systems have not adequately been evaluated as well as the impacts of integrated media upon enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR).

40|$|Biological aerated filters {{operate as}} fixed film systems in which {{micro-organisms}} grow on a submerged fixed structured or granular inert support media within an aerated reactor (Stephenson et al., 1993). Periodic backwashing of the filter is required {{as the media}} bed gradually clogs due {{to the growth of}} biomass and retention of solids. The advantage of the BAF process is the small footprint it occupies relative to comparable processes such as activated sludge and trickling filters. The small footprint {{is due to the fact}} that the <b>fixed</b> <b>film</b> <b>of</b> biomass on the support material (media) leads to a high concentration of active bacteria per unit volume of the media and thereby to relatively small reactors. Another advantage is the retention of suspended solids that eliminate the need for final sedimentation tanks (Hagedorn et al., 1994). For the same degree of treatment, biofilters require approximately three times less aeration volume than activated sludge units, and twenty times less than trickling filters (Smith et al., 1992). In summary BAF systems are used for providing a treatment method for reducing the amount of organic carbonaceous material (BOD/COD), suspended solids and ammonia in wastewater...|$|R
25|$|Measures {{creating}} uniform wastewater loadings tend {{to reduce}} the probability of upsets. Fixed-film or attached growth secondary treatment bioreactors are similar to a plug flow reactor model circulating water over surfaces colonized by biofilm, while suspended-growth bioreactors resemble a continuous stirred-tank reactor keeping microorganisms suspended while water is being treated. Secondary treatment bioreactors may {{be followed by a}} physical phase separation to remove biological solids from the treated water. Upset duration <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>film</b> secondary treatment systems may be longer because of the time required to recolonize the treatment surfaces. Suspended growth ecosystems may be restored from a population reservoir. Activated sludge recycle systems provide an integrated reservoir if upset conditions are detected in time for corrective action. Sludge recycle may be temporarily turned off to prevent sludge washout during peak storm flows when dilution keeps BOD concentrations low. Suspended growth activated sludge systems can be operated in a smaller space than fixed-film trickling filter systems that treat the same amount of water; but fixed-film systems are better able to cope with drastic changes in the amount of biological material and can provide higher removal rates for organic material and suspended solids than suspended growth systems.|$|R

The laboratory scale reactor treatment built system operated as an integrated model with the collection system beginning at the source of the wastewater. Using a single stage trickling filter following the septic tank, the laboratory scale reactor system achieved 81 % chemical oxygen demand removal, 36 % NH 3 -N removal and 56 % phosphorus removal. The total phosphorus removal averaged 50 % during steady state operation of phase one. On the other hand, the two stage filter system achieved 90 %, chemical oxygen demand removal and as high as 90 % ammonia removal and phosphorus removal of approximately 50 %. These results indicate that, chemical oxygen demand, NH 3 -N and phosphorus removals can be significantly improved by additional single stage trickling filter system after septic tank treatment.
