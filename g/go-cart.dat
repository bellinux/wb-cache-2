5|$|In the meantime, Kyle, Stan and Kenny watch America's Stupidest Home Videos; {{they hear}} there's a $10,000 grand prize for the stupidest home video. They decide {{to enter the}} {{competition}} with the video they made of Cartman. Cartman approaches Kyle and Stan (Kenny was dragged to a train track by Stan's <b>go-cart</b> and killed by an oncoming train) with the depressing news about his lack of funds to find out his real father. Stan and Kyle agree that if they win the video contest they will give Cartman the $3,000 needed for the DNA testing. Cartman is overjoyed, but quickly becomes extremely angry after seeing the aired video. Though they do not win the competition, as Stan's grandfather wins with a videotape he made of Kenny's death, they receive a $3,000 runner-up prize instead, which is still enough for the DNA test. Dr. Mephesto calls together Cartman, his mother and all potential fathers (including the 1989 Denver Broncos), when he gets the test results which is where Kenny comes back to life. When {{he is about to}} reveal the identity of Cartman's father, a narrator states that the answer will be revealed in the new South Park episode four weeks later, much to Cartman's annoyance and anger.|$|E
25|$|Jarlsberg Luftsportssenter ENJB was {{incorporated}} on 7 March 1991 {{with the intention}} of renovating and potentially taking over the airport. The following year Solberg reported the aviation club to the police for illegal use of the airfield, but the issue was rejected.

Jarlsberg Luftsportssenter received a building permit for new facilities, including an extension of the runway to , on 19 June 1993.

25|$|Rushmore {{uses the}} unique style of {{cinematography}} that Wes Anderson has become well known for. The film has a singular sense of colour, focusing mainly on blues, greens, and reds {{in order to}} create a heightened reality. The montage sequence in the beginning of the film is strongly influenced by the rapid transitions used by French New Wave filmmakers. The shot of Max in the <b>go-cart</b> also resembles a photograph by Jacques Henri Lartigue. This montage sequence was almost cancelled by Disney executives as it was not believed that these short singular shots were required in regard to the budget and time frame the film was restricted by. Therefore, the sequence was shot quickly whenever the crew were at a suitable location.|$|E

60|$|The {{drawback}} is, {{one never}} really knows one's hosts and hostesses.
