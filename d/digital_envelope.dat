40|$|A {{new concept}} for {{computer}} security is proposed.

The difference between encryption and enveloping is as follows. To encrypt a message is to scramble it into an unreadable form, leaving its presence overt to the public. While digital picture enveloping protects the secret information in a different way. It makes the secret information covert to any human eyes. People see the vessel image as a natural image.

Generally, security is characterized in terms of privacy, authenticity and integrity of digital data. Privacy is a network access issue and is not considered in this paper. We present a method, authenticity and integrity of digital mammography, here which can meet the requirements of authenticity and integrity for mammography image (IM) transmission. The authenticity and integrity for mammography (AIDM) consists of the following four modules. 1) Image preprocessing: To segment breast pixels from background and extract patient information from digital imaging and communication in medicine (DICOM) image header. 2) Image hashing: To compute an image hash value of the mammogram using the MD 5 hash algorithm. 3) Data encryption: To produce a <b>digital</b> <b>envelope</b> containing the encrypted image hash value (digital signature) and corresponding patient information. 4) Data embedding: To embed the <b>digital</b> <b>envelope</b> into the image. This is done by replacing the least significant bit of a random pixel of the mammogram by one bit of the <b>digital</b> <b>envelope</b> bit stream and repeating for all bits in the bit stream. Experiments with digital IMs demonstrate the following. 1) In the expert center, only the user who knows the private key can open the <b>digital</b> <b>envelope</b> and read the patient information data and the digital signature of the mammogram transmitted from the examination site. 2) Data integrity can be verified by matching the image hash value decrypted from the digital signature with that computed from the transmitted image. 3) No visual quality degradation is detected in the embedded image compared with the original. Our preliminary results demonstrate that AIDM is an effective method for image authenticity and integrity in telemammography application.

40|$|Abstract—SET (Secure Electronic Transaction) is {{an immense}} {{e-commerce}} protocol {{designed to improve}} the security of credit card purchases. In this paper {{we focus on the}} initial bootstrapping phases of SET, whose objective is the registration of cardholders and merchants with a SET certificate authority. The aim of registration is twofold: getting the approval of the cardholder’s or merchant’s bank, and replacing traditional credit card numbers with electronic credentials that cardholders can present to the merchant, so that their privacy is protected. These registration sub-protocols present a number of challenges to current formal verification methods. First, they do not assume that each agent knows the public keys of the other agents. Key distribution is one of the protocols’ tasks. Second, SET uses complex encryption primitives (<b>digital</b> <b>envelopes)</b> which introduce dependency chains: the loss of one secret key can lead to potentially unlimited losses. Building upon our previous work, {{we have been able to}} model and formally verify SET’s registration with the inductive method in Isabelle/HOL.

The advent of digital networks, which make copying and distribution of digital content quick, easy, and undetectable, has provided the impetus for CMS research and development. CMS are premised on the concept of 2 ̆ 2 trusted systems 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 secure <b>digital</b> <b>envelopes</b> 2 ̆ 2 that protect copyrighted content and allow access and subsequent copying only to the extent authorized by the copyright owner. Software developers are testing prototype systems designed to detect, prevent, count, and levy precise charges for uses that range from downloading to excerpting to simply viewing or listening to digital works. In a few years, for example, an individual seeking online access to a collection of short fiction might be greeted with a menu of options including: Open and view short story A — 0. 50, or 0. 40 for students doing assigned reading (verified based on roster submitted by instructor) Open and view short story B (by a more popular author) — 0. 80, or 0. 70 for students Download short story A (encrypted and copy-protected) — 1. 35 Download short story B — 2. 25 Download entire collection — 15. 00 Extract excerpt from short story A — 0. 03 per 50 words Extract excerpt from short story B — 0. 06 per 50 words CMS also loom large on the legislative horizon. Copyright owners have argued that technological protection alone will not deter unauthorized copying unless the law provides penalties for circumventing the technology. Although a bill to protect CMS against tampering failed to reach a vote in Congress last year, the World Intellectual Property Organization 2 ̆ 7 s recent adoption of treaty provisions requiring protection means that Congress must revisit the question soon. Part II describes these developments. The seemingly inexorable trend toward a digital CMS regime raises two questions, which the author addresses in parts III and IV, respectively. First, broadly drawn protection for CMS has the potential to proscribe technologies that have indisputably lawful uses and also to foreclose, as a practical matter, uses of copyrighted works that copyright law expressly permits. How may protection for CMS be drafted to avoid disrupting the current copyright balance? Second, and equally fundamental, CMS may enable both pervasive monitoring of individual reading activity and comprehensive 2 ̆ 2 private legislation 2 ̆ 2 designed to augment—and possibly alter beyond recognition—the default rules that define and delimit copyright owners 2 ̆ 7 rights.
