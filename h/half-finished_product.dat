40|$|Rattan {{is one of}} non timber product forest {{which is}} very famous in Indonesia. Indonesia has 350 from  the total of 600 rattan species in the world.   Indonesia rattan {{potential}} is getting more significant when {{it is known that}} among 350 species, only 53 species have been traded in both local and international market. Recently, Indonesia rattan industry facing some serious conditions, such as decreasing raw rattan production, dropping export volume and value of rattan product, and popping out the  imitation rattan.   Improper policy of government, by closing and opening the export the <b>half-finished</b> <b>product</b> of rattan without comprehensive consideration and analyzing become active catalyst of falling down for Indonesia rattan industry. Whereas in “Porter’s Five Forces” concept which was written by Michael Porter (1980), it was stated that the material component is one of five industrial environmental conditions.

40|$|Background: In {{terms of}} Lean Six Sigma, {{the whole process}} focuses on clients and their needs. Existence of a client generates the supply of companies. Extended {{customization}} has a negative impact for a structure of the production system. Dynamics of changes and no predictability of system’s state in time t+ 1 lead to increase of the operational costs. It particularly affects those companies which are producing goods using MTO (make – to – order) method in short series. The goal {{of this article is}} to establish a mathematical model defining how the structure of a production system is subject to change depending on the volume of the production batch for a production system in accordance with MTO. Furthermore pilot calculations have been presented which determine the probability value, how subsequent random variables are contained within three standard deviations (± 3 δ) from the determined expected value (ET) for the entire production structure. Months of analysis and research on introducing selected lean toolbox components to a polish company from the small and medium enterprises sector resulted in the models presented in the article. The production structure of the discussed actual facility is complex and is of converged nature in accordance with MTO, while the final products are manufactured in short production series with a relatively wide customization options. 	Materials and results: Wrought models consider theories of  Klir and Maserovicz [Mesarovic 1964] and also theory of mass operation (one of the probability areas).   In the article there are results from two models which are fundamental in defining problems in logistics engineering and production in scientific research. Important attribute of presented models is a fact that they consider relations between variables in a structure of consecutive processes and also consider relations between a size of production party and a real object. 	Presented models are not only theoretical coverage but also consider real relations between objects. Real productive object specialized in producing cooling devices destined to store hematogenous objects, plasma and cryoprecipitate has been analyzed. Those devices have very strict quality requirements (consistent with ISO 13485 and CE 0434 in accordance with Directive 93 / 42 /EEC). 	In the article there is a presentation of three models which indicates two different functions of production time for production party of  2 ≤ k ≤ 30 and k > 30   items.   In the following model there are a few different parameters of the production system: variable parameters of processes’ times which depend on a kind of <b>half-finished</b> <b>product,</b> dependency of time needed to produce an item, size of a production party and also dependency of operational times and implemented technology. 	Conclusions: It is important to customize tools to individual attributes of a system whilst implementing changes in real objects. One change can be effective in one organization and not necessarily in the other. Wrought model is a first of the steps in building a scheme necessary to validate a real object in time t+ 1. On the next step those theories will be implemented in IT tool environment of R Studio or Witness System Simulation Modeling to conduct statistical analysis based on historical data...|$|E

What worse, sometimes implementation is imperfect. It means extra cost. With this reason unusually important is the choice of system. To consider potential costs and advantage may be used performance measures (e. g. ROI analysis) and treatment management information system (MIS) as strategic investments at organization. Estimating of measures should take into account: business advantages, technical advantages, direct and indirect costs of implementation.

"It is {{doubtful}} whether {{the replacement of}} German agriculture on a sound basis {{in the last ten}} years is to be ascribed in a greater measure to technical advance in agricultural methods, or to the development of the co-operative system. Perhaps it would be right to say that for the large farms it is due to the first, and for the smaller farms (three quarters of the arable land in Germany) to the second. For it is only through co-operation that the advantages of farming on a large scale are made possible for smaller farmers. The more important of those advantages are the regulated purchase of all raw materials and <b>half-finished</b> <b>products</b> (artificial manures, feeding stuffs, seeds, etc.), better prices for products, facilities for making use, in moderation, of personal credit at a cheap rate of interest, together with the possibility of saving and putting aside small sums of interest; all these advantages of the large farmer have been placed within the reach of the small farmers by local co-operative societies for buying, selling, and farming co-operatively, as well as by saving and other banks, all connected to central associations and central co-operative societies.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} behaviour {{of material}} flows at stages of complicated  logistic industrial and transport systems. Key parameters of logistic delivery schemes are analyzed in the paper. The paper estimates an {{influence of a}} time parameter {{on the level of}} transport and logistics costs and, as a consequence, on  a final finished product. While determining a stock level it is necessary to know not only an intensity of material resource consumption by manufacturing process  for a concrete period of time, but also a probability of non-observance of   transport service terms and cost of stock storage. Stocks of mass cargoes are basically formed at first stages of industrial and transport system and cost of their storage is relatively insignificant. However deficit presence of the given resources influences on functioning of all subsequent interrelated stages of the industrial and transport system. Thus, a risk of deficit occurrence of the given resources can be probably reduced by creating a high stock rate. There is a processing of hi-tech component items (or <b>half-finished</b> <b>products)</b> at last stages of the industrial and transport system. Expenses on storage of such resources  are usually high and possibility of their substitution by analogous ones is insignificant. At last stages a mobilization of facilities for provision of on-time delivery is more profitable that allows to save on stock arrangement. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} {{reports to}} developments recently performed for the non-destructive evaluation of welds produced by Laser welding {{as well as}} for production monitoring {{as well as for}} quality inspection. Laser welding shows some peculiarities compared with other types of welding procedures. This is on one hand the advantage to have a very small heat-affected zone and therefore not affecting the mechanical properties of the full product very much. On the other hand microstructure gradients combined with residual stresses are very steep and so also the gradients in the properties. Furthermore one type of nonconformity is also typical for Laser welding, i. e. the micro porosity. During the last years Fraunhofer-IZFP has performed research for monitoring Laser welds in tailored blanks manufactured as <b>half-finished</b> <b>products</b> for car body fabrication. Ultrasonic inspection systems based on the transmitting and receiving of electro-magnetically excited ultrasonic waves have been developed and introduced in the industrial application. For classification of the different types of scattering geometries - linear-dimensional, crack-like nonconformities like lack of fusion or three-dimensional, globular-ones like pores - are separated by using a back reflected and a forward-scattered mode. Due to the higher specular reflection the findings of linear scatterers compared with the others, clearly can be classified by amplitude thresh-holding. The advantage of the technique is the contact-less working transducer, which is gliding on an air pillow avoiding scratches at the sensitive surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Pulsed-magnetic {{fields are}} used for {{execution}} of a whole complex of technological processes: dividing, forming, assembling, welding and others. In all these technologies <b>half-finished</b> <b>products</b> from sheets, sections and tubes are used as billets. Action of magnetic fields on a cast metal is known in the metallurgy production, for example, casting to an electromagnetic crystallizer. In spite of a high electrical resistance of a melt and owing to low mechanical resistance of a liquid metal the use of high-intensity pulse-magnetic fields (PMF) in technologies of mechanical engineering is of interest. Even the first exploration experiment showed high efficiency of such action. At energy of 1, 2 kJ {{a portion of the}} melt under the action of the PMF has flown more than 4 m, spread {{in the form of a}} thin film on the ceiling and solidified. The paper presents three basic technological schemes of such action: with influence through a wall of a magneto-transparent crucible; by an immersion inductor; and action from the surface. Factors accompanying such action are: added sources of heat as a result of flowing of induced eddy currents through the melt; force action on the melt responsible for passage of waves of stress and metal flows. Action of these factors is controllable both in intensity and in direction. The temporal action of the pulse-magnetic field on a liquid and crystallizing metal (LCM) is to be matched with a curve of cooling the melt: either on the portion above the crystallization area or on its different portions, that is, at different relationships of solid and liquid phases. Factors of action of the pulse-magnetic field change temperature conditions of crystallization influence on the number of centers of crystallization and, as the consequence, change structure and properties of cast metal. The paper presents results of first studies on action of the pulse-magnetic field on a LCM which testify that such action is real and good. This has determined the prospects for development of new technologies in metallurgy (forming of an ingots structure, stirring of a material, rolling of cast metal and so on) and in mechanical engineering (in casting, stamping, welding and others) ...|$|R
