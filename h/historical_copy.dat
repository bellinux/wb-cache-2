5000|$|On October 17, 2013 Variety.com {{announced}} the website isoHunt would {{shut down by}} Oct. 23, 2013, {{as part of a}} settlement in a massive copyright infringement suit filed by Hollywood studios, agreeing to pay $110 million for claims that the site induced the violation of copyrighted movies and TV shows although isoHunt never hosted such content. The settlement terms included a $110 million judgment against isoHunt and its owner, Gary Fung, ending a seven-year legal battle over its operations. According to court documents cited by the BBC, Fung's company will likely be able to pay only between two and four million dollars though.The site shut down on 21 October 2013, 2 days earlier than the announced date, leaving a note from Gary Fung and a link to a YouTube [...] "trailer for the movie Terminator Salvation" [...] that is actually a Rickroll. Initiating Self DestructThis is it. We are shutting down isoHunt services a little early. I'm told there was this Internet archival team that wants to make <b>historical</b> <b>copy</b> of our [...]torrent files, I'm honoured that people thinks our site is worthy of historical preservation, but the truth is about 95% of those [...]torrent files can be found off Google regardless and mostly have been indexed from other BitTorrent sites in the first place. So I might as well do a proper send-off to you dear isoHunt users, before final shutdown sequence on Tuesday. It's been an adventure in the last 10.5 years working on isoHunt, a privilege working with some of the smartest guys I've worked with, and my life won't be the same without it. For what I'm working on next, please look up my blog on Google and follow me there. Because as the Terminator would say with a German accent,I'll be backkk. Gary Fung ...|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "athame" [...] in {{its modern}} {{spelling}} first appears in Wicca, but it originates from words found in two <b>historical</b> <b>copies</b> of the Key of Solomon.

25|$|Several {{certified}} <b>historical</b> <b>copies</b> {{are displayed}} {{in the library of}} St Catherine, some of which are witnessed by the judges of Islam to affirm historical authenticity. The monks claims that during the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in the Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–17), the original document was seized from the monastery by Ottoman soldiers and taken to Sultan Selim I's palace in Istanbul for safekeeping. A copy was then made to compensate for its loss at the monastery. It also seems that the charter was renewed under the new rulers, as other documents in the archive suggest. Traditions about the tolerance shown towards the monastery were reported in governmental documents issued in Cairo and during the period of Ottoman rule (1517–1798), the Pasha of Egypt annually reaffirmed its protections.|$|R

50|$|After his {{retirement}} in 1931, he became advisory printing councilor to the Enoch Pratt Free Library and in 1935, the Library of Congress again asked him to reproduce more work—this time the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. Since he could not work from the originals, they gave him 30-year-old photographs, with many words and letters missing from {{the aging of the}} film. He saw the beauty and impressiveness of the originals documents and felt that a print made from the photographs would be a sacrilege, so he commissioned a fine letterer, who had been in his employ, to supply the missing letters and words. He also removed the smears and blotches caused by the film and thus was able to bring out entirely perfect reproductions of both <b>historical</b> documents. <b>Copies</b> of these are in great demand.|$|R
