25|$|A {{hydraulic}} jump {{is a phenomenon}} in the science of hydraulics which is frequently observed in open channel flow such as rivers and spillways. When liquid at high velocity discharges into a zone of lower velocity, a rather abrupt rise occurs in the liquid surface. The rapidly <b>flowing</b> <b>liquid</b> is abruptly slowed and increases in height, converting some of the flow's initial kinetic energy into an increase in potential energy, with some energy irreversibly lost through turbulence to heat. In an open channel flow, this manifests as the fast flow rapidly slowing and piling {{up on top of}} itself similar to how a shockwave forms.|$|E

NASA scientists furthermore stated that they think that Vesta is the [...] "last of its kind" [...] – the only remaining example of the large planetoids that came together to form the rocky planets during the formation of the Solar System. In October 2012, NASA stated that data from Dawn had revealed the origin of anomalous dark spots and streaks on Vesta's surface, which were likely deposited by ancient asteroid impacts. In December 2012, it was reported that Dawn had observed gullies on the surface of Vesta that were interpreted to have been eroded by transiently <b>flowing</b> <b>liquid</b> water.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a real-time water simulation framework {{with respect to}} wave propagation in <b>flowing</b> <b>liquids.</b> The presented method {{is based on the}} coupling of <b>liquid</b> <b>flow</b> simulation and simulation of surface waves. Physically, our system combines the solution of the Navier-Stokes Equations with the solution of the 2 D Wave Equation. Numerically, we combine the concept of wave particles with a FDM-based flow simulation. Thus, wave propagation in fast <b>flowing</b> <b>liquids</b> (e. g., a creek) can be simulated – in real-time. Therefore, it is very suitable for today’s video games and VR-environments. Finally, we discuss the coupling of the liquid simulation with a rigid-body simulation and a fountain simulation.

Non-wetting flow {{is an important factor in}} modelling the <b>flow</b> of <b>liquid</b> iron and slag in the blast furnace lower zone where the liquid iron does not wet the coke.

The maximum percolation velocity at the bottom of the packed bed are also measured using high speed video analysis. Water, mercury and glycerol are selected to examine the effect of physical properties on the <b>liquid</b> <b>flow</b> behaviours and maximum percolation velocity. By adding the visual dimension, this study contributes to better understanding of the flow behaviours of non-wetting liquid through a packed bed...|$|R
