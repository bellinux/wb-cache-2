She writes it, she comes back. She does a version of it, we talk about it. It's a back and forth until she gets it right. It's a total collaboration.|$|E

He went on a tour that included Melbourne on 9 August 2008 at the Solidarity Fiesta at the MUA Auditorium he said ....

500|$|Regarding the band's reunion, Lytle noted, [...] "The bargain I {{made myself}} {{regarding}} the 'brief reunion and couple of shows' situation was that I wasn't gonna {{talk too much}} about it. I was just gonna stew on it, and then do it. That's {{the good thing about}} festivals. No need for me to sell anything here. Get in, rock out, get paid, <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> are just going to be a few shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something. Money was a motivating factor (resurfacing my indoor tennis court, oil change for my 4×4 Ferrari) but the idea of playing and hanging out with each other is something all of the guys are pretty stoked about." ...|$|E
500|$|Even after {{achieving}} the record, Hershiser expressed regret: [...] "Because {{of respect for}} Don {{and respect for the}} record, I don't think I should have walked to the mound in a situation where I'm supposed to be resting for the playoffs, just to beat a record. That would have tarnished the whole thing." [...] According to some sources, Drysdale was the person who convinced Hershiser to take the mound for the tenth inning, saying, [...] "I gave him a kick in the pants and told him to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and go as far as he can". However, other sources state that Drysdale merely said that if he had known about Hershiser's hesitance to break the record, he would have reassured him, saying [...] "I'd have kicked him right in the rear if I had known that... I'd have told him to get his buns out there and get them." ...|$|E

500|$|Lytle {{also noted}} that he was likely to record a new Grandaddy album, stating, [...] "It's {{probably}} going to happen.... If anyone knows anything about Grandaddy, they realise that my [...] music and Grandaddy's music is slightly interchangeable. I think if I were to focus on making a Grandaddy record [...] a full-blown Grandaddy record, and I {{like the idea of}} that. I'd like to give it a shot." [...] In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: [...] "I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over my head like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and tour in support of it?'... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where I can make Grandaddy records every so often and not have all this messy stuff that goes along with it.

500|$|... "Initially, {{this was}} {{simply going to}} be an album of piano and voice", Wainwright stated in a May 2007 {{interview}} with The Independent Nick Duerden. That was, however, until he visited Berlin, which influenced the album's lush sound. Wainwright declared, [...] "Basically, a huge wave of German Romanticism descended on the recording process, and almost drowned me." [...] Wainwright cited two reasons for the change in direction and the heightened dramatic flare: the cancer diagnosis received by his mother (folk musician Kate McGarrigle) during the album's genesis, which he found [...] "fueled his creative intensity in some kind of displaced attempt to get her well", and the New York Metropolitan Opera's commissioning Wainwright to write an opera, making Release the Stars a way of training for such a large project. Revealing the overall theme in January 2007, Wainwright declared the album was about opening up and following impulses. [...] "Whether it's the environment, politics or religious warfare", Wainwright stated in an interview with The Japan Times, [...] "it's time to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and {{be a part of the}} solution, whatever that is." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Lewis told Tom Eames that Glassheart has a running theme about [...] "star-crossed lovers that can't be together", {{and so it was}} likely that this idea would feature on the tour. Lewis also cited William Shakespeare as another source of inspiration. She spent the three days of the final tour rehearsals at The Backstage Centre in Purfleet, Essex (UK). The Glassheart Tour was scheduled to visit twenty-one venues across Germany and the United Kingdom. The tour was expected to begin on 15 April in Berlin. The list had expanded from an initial sixteen to include five dates in Germany. Lewis would then proceed with UK dates beginning in Glasgow, including two dates at London's Royal Albert Hall before finishing on 18 May in Plymouth. Speaking about the tour, Lewis said [...] "I can't wait to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and play my new songs. I had such fun on my last tour and I'm really excited about doing it again next year."

But we wanted to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and drive and put on a show. Delaying it every half an hour was the way it had to be." [...] During the waiting period on Saturday, many teams had engaged in tomfoolery in the paddock to entertain the crowds, such as bowling or ballroom dancing between Red Bull teammates Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat. Ferrari later condemned the behaviour of their fellow teams, with team principal Maurizio Arrivabene saying: [...] "We are a Formula One team, not the Cirque du Soleil." [...] Kimi Räikkönen backed him, stating: [...] "I think this is F1 and not the circus. The people are obviously not happy when we're not running but we cannot make them happy with whatever we do apart from running." ...|$|E
500|$|Angelina's {{dream is}} to be a {{successful}} singer on the music charts. DeGarmo noted that her father, Angelo, [...] "who thinks his spoiled-brat daughter sings like a choir of angels" [...] puts pressure on Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), a young and upcoming music producer, to show Angelina the ropes of the music industry and make her a success. DeGarmo said: [...] "Unfortunately, she’s not as good a singer as she and her father think she is [...] Angelina is a bit oblivious to reality, but will slowly come to grips with it over the next few weeks. As a singer myself, it’s liberating to get on the set and throw all ego – and notes – aside and surprise people." [...] DeGarmo commented: [...] "It's fantastically hilarious because it puts the poor kid in a horrible predicament!" [...] She said that Angelina was into Top 40 music at first, but: [...] "the writers have her singing the American standards — Judy Garland, that sort of thing. We want the audience to be really familiar with the songs, so they can tell how badly Angie is butchering them." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that you needed [...] "skill to play a bad singer", to which DeGarmo said that it's harder than people realize: [...] "but it's really liberating to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and be bad. You just throw your ego to the wind and sing for Jesus." [...] Devon would eventually go on to make Angelina a good singer. Angelina briefly fired Devon for adding rap verses to a song of hers which was soaring on the charts, but he retained the rights of the track.|$|E
500|$|The Ramones' {{debut album}} had an outsized effect {{relative}} to its modest sales. According to Generation X bassist Tony James, [...] "Everybody went up three gears {{the day they}} got that first Ramones album. Punk rock—that rama-lama super fast stuff—is totally down to the Ramones. Bands were just playing in an MC5 groove until then." [...] The Ramones' two July 1976 shows, like their debut album, are seen as having {{a significant impact on}} the style of many of the newly formed British punk acts—as one observer put it, [...] "instantly nearly every band speeded up". The Ramones' first British concert, at London's Roundhouse concert hall, was held on July 4, 1976, the United States Bicentennial. The Sex Pistols were playing in Sheffield that evening, supported by the Clash, making their public debut. The next night, members of both bands attended the Ramones' gig at the Dingwall's club. Ramones manager Danny Fields recalls a conversation between Johnny Ramone and Clash bassist Paul Simonon (which he mislocates at the Roundhouse): [...] "Johnny asked him, 'What do you do? Are you in a band?' Paul said, 'Well, we just rehearse. We call ourselves the Clash but we're not good enough.' Johnny said, 'Wait till you see us—we stink, we're lousy, we can't play. Just <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and do it.'" [...] Another band whose members saw the Ramones perform, the Damned, played their first show two days later. The central fanzine of the early UK punk scene, Sniffin' Glue, was named after the song [...] "Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue", which appeared on the debut LP.|$|E

500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, but we did {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing what the problem is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> in the world... it’s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and we know how to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project".|$|E
