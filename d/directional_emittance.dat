40|$|<b>Directional</b> <b>emittance</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the calculation of radiative heat exchange. It partly determines the thermal insulation of single and multiple glazing and the efficiency of solar collectors. An emissiometer has been designed and built, capable for measurements of the <b>directional</b> <b>emittance</b> at angles up to 85 degree(s). The emissiometer can be used for absolute measurements, with a black body radiator as reference, and for relative measurements using a known reference sample. In the case of low-emissivity materials the <b>directional</b> <b>emittance</b> usually has a maximum at an angle between 80 degree(s) and 90 degree(s) (pseudo Brewster angle). The emissiometer is, therefore, especially useful for the accurate characterization of low-emissivity materials like spectral selective coated glazing and solar absorbers. The paper gives a description of the instrument and results are discussed for three coated glass samples with low, medium, and high emissivity, respectively, which were measured for a temperature of 283 K.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{measuring}} the <b>directional</b> <b>emittance</b> of paper and board samples was developed. The available literature showed that the influence of temperature and observation angle on the emittance of dry and moist paper had not been investigated in detail. Methods adapted for such investigations were not available. In the developed method, the emittance of a sample is determined by comparing its infrared radiation with the radiation emitted from a reference surface with known emittance. In order to investigate {{the influence of the}} wavelength range, two cameras, operating in the mid-wavelength and long-wavelength infrared range, respectively, were used. The method allows for the adjustment of the directional emission angle in a range from 0 ° down to 80 °, and variation of the sample temperature between 30 °C and 100 °C. A study was performed to evaluate the method. Here, the <b>directional</b> <b>emittance</b> of handsheets made from thermo-mechanical pulp was measured at different wavelength ranges, sample temperatures and emission angles. The obtained emittance values and trends were in agreement with previous experimental work and theoretical predictions. The emittance of the samples was also measured using Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy.

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} the thermal radiative properties of thin-film selective emitters used in thermophotovoltaic applications has been performed, It {{has been found that}} the effective <b>directional</b> <b>emittance</b> depends strongly on the physical thickness, refractive index and spectral extinction coefficient of the films. The emissivity exhibits a saturation, for an optical depth greater than unity, which is dependent on the refractive index and extinction coefficient of the material, namely the higher the refractive index and extinction coefficient, the lower the saturation value. For transparent films, the thickness required to achieve saturation is of the order of tens of micrometres whereas much lower thicknesses are required for absorbing films. Significantly, an anomalous increase in emittance at low thickness for high-index films has been observed, which might be of particular interest in thermophotovoltaic applications. The emittance has also been found to be strongly dependent on the emissivity and reflectivity of the substrates and on the direction of propagation of radiation. The total hemispherical emittance of the films has been found to increase with increasing temperature and total <b>directional</b> <b>emittance,</b> for the wavelength range 0. 9 - 1. 5 mu m.

40|$|Abstract. The basic {{equations}} for calculating radiation entropy and {{the major}} input functions to these equations, namely the spectral and directional distribution of radiation intensity and its degree of polarisation, are presented. Thermodynamic evaluation of energy conversion processes {{by means of the}} balance equations requires all involved energy and entropy fluxes to be known. The incoming radiation energy and entropy can be obtained from atmospheric models, but the properties of the outgoing radiation strongly depend on the optical properties of the surface. As the required optical properties usually are not available over the entire spectral range and for all directions, measurements are performed in order to improve the accuracy of the energy and entropy balances. An apparatus is presented, capable of measuring the spectral <b>directional</b> <b>emittance</b> and the degree of polarisation of the emitted radiation in the range of infrared wavelengths. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{temperature}} distribution on solar trough absorber tubes determines thermal losses and hotspots {{can lead to}} material stress and limit absorber tube lifetime. The concentrated solar radiation, however, {{makes it difficult to}} determine the temperature on solar absorbers. Temperature sensors that require contact to the measurement object are not appropriate and even pyrometry fails, when external light sources interfere. Only solar-blind pyrometry offers reliable temperature readings without perturbation through reflected solar radiation. This paper presents two concepts for a pyrometric solar-blind measurement on solar trough absorber tubes. One solar-blind approach is a spectral measurement range in regions, where the solar spectrum shows gaps due to the discrete absorption of the atmosphere. Another possibility for a solar-blind pyrometric temperature measurement results from the optical behavior, i. e. the distinct angle dependence of the <b>directional</b> reflectance and <b>emittance</b> of a typical selective trough absorber coating.

40|$|The <b>directional</b> <b>emittance</b> of dry {{and moist}} {{paper and board}} samples was {{measured}} in two wavelength ranges; the mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) range and the long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) range. The influence of pulp type, pulp drying, pulp refining, fibre orientation, additives, coating, and observation angle on the emittance of dry paper was examined. The influence of sample moisture and observation angle on the emittance of moist samples was also investigated. The emittance in the LWIR range was higher than the MWIR emittance. The emittance varied with pulp type, especially for TMP, which had a significantly lower emittance compared to the samples made of chemical pulp. The impact of different properties, such as pulp type, refining or coating, was much smaller in the LWIR range than in the MWIR range. Observation angle was found to significantly impact the emittance at angles larger than 60 degrees from the normal direction in the MWIR range, and angles larger than 70 degrees in the LWIR range. The emittance increased with increasing moisture ratio. This increase was most pronounced at low absolute moisture ratios, where an addition of an already small amount of water could impart a large change in emittance.

40|$|By {{the end of}} {{this century}} the Earth Observing System (EOS) will provide worldwide, thermal infrared, {{multispectral}} images of the Earth, presenting geologists with a new kind of remote sensing data for interpretation. Thus it has become essential to understand the spectral emittance behavior of terrestrial surface materials. Perhaps the most fundamental question to be answereed is the extent to which such materials follow Kirchhoff's law (epsilon = 1 -R) under laboratory and field conditions, especially when a sample displays a thermal gradient. We present the first rigorous quantitative comparison of directional and hemispherical reflectance and <b>directional</b> <b>emittance</b> of rock and soil samples in the laboratory, with thermal gradients induced by heating them from below and allowing them to radiate to a colder background. The results show that only an extemeley low density sample composed of fine particles sifted into a 'fairy castle' structure displays a thermal gradient steep enough within the infrared skin depth to cause significant (6 %) departure from Kirchhoff's law. There is no detectable effect on the more normal terrestrial samples, such as soils and rocks measured in the laboratory, even when semitransparent coatings are involved. Thus both emittance and reflectance measurements can be used to calculate sample emissivity for most terrestrial surface materieals. However, the effect on Kirchhoffian behavior of different field environments, which may induce a steeper thermal gradient in particulate samples, has yet to be determined, and some low-density surface materials like newly fallen snow, frost, and efflorescent salts on playas have yet to be measured in emittance...|$|E
40|$|The thermophysical {{properties}} of the fines from the Apollo 12 landing site have been determined {{as a function of}} their relevant parameters.

The maximum surface of 389 K is obtained at lunar noon while the minimum temperature of 86. 1 K is obtained at sunrise. It is shown that the most significant effects on temperature, as compared with previous calculations, are caused by using the directional reflectance which controls the amount of solar energy absorption during the day in place of a constant hemispherical reflectance.

40|$|Power {{generation}} in solar energy systems, thermal control in buildings and mitigation of the Urban Heat Island problem, are all sensitive to directional response to incoming radiation. The radiation absorption and emission profile {{also plays a}} crucial role in each system's response and depends strongly on surface finish. This important sensitivity needs wider recognition in materials data sheets, system modeling, plus in materials and environmental engineering. The impact of surface roughness on thermal response of natural and man-made external environments is examined. Important examples will be given of the role of surface finish within each class. Total emittance links to the way surface finish influences <b>directional</b> <b>emittance</b> E(θ). Smooth surface thermal emittance on PV module covers, many solar absorbers, some roof paints, polished concrete, and glass windows can be up to 15 % different from insulator results based on fully diffuse models of the same material. Widespread evidence indicates smooth metals and low-E solar absorber surfaces cool faster, and smooth insulators slower than previously thought. Matt paint is cooler than low sheen paint under the same solar heating impacts and normal concrete cooler than polished. Emittance for water is the prime environmental example of oblique impacts as it reflects strongly at oblique incidence, which leads to a significant drop in E(θ). Ripples or waves however raise water's average emittance. A surprise in this work was the high sensitivity of total E and its angular components to roughness in the depth range of 0. 1 – 0. 8 [*]μm, which are well under ambient thermal IR wavelengths of 3 – 30 [*]μm but common in metal finishing. Parallel energy flows such as evaporation and convective cooling vary if emittance varies. Thermal image analysis can provide insights into angular radiative effects...|$|E
