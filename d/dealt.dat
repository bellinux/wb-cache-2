5|$|Tute in Pairs {{is played}} by four players—two teams of two players each—and every player {{receives}} ten cards (since there are 40 cards, this means {{that all of the}} cards in the deck are <b>dealt).</b> The last card to be <b>dealt</b> is shown {{to the rest of the}} players and becomes the trump. This card belongs to the player it was <b>dealt</b> to. The four people sit in a circle, with opponent players to the right and left of each player, and players sitting opposite their team members.|$|E
5|$|American, Arabian, German, Spanish, and Turkish establishments {{were also}} damaged and destroyed, but in {{contrast}} to the Chinese, U.S. properties were only <b>dealt</b> US$22,000 ($ today) in damage.|$|E

5|$|For finite-dimensional representations, the {{presence}} of semisimplicity means that the Lorentz group can be <b>dealt</b> with {{the same way as}} other semisimple groups using a well-developed theory. In addition, all representations are built from the irreducible ones, since the Lie algebra possesses the complete reducibility property. But, the non-compactness of the Lorentz group, in combination with lack of simple connectedness, cannot be <b>dealt</b> with in all the aspects as in the simple framework that applies to simply connected, compact groups. Non-compactness implies, for a connected simple Lie group, that no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary representations exist. Lack of simple connectedness gives rise to spin representations of the group. The non-connectedness means that, for representations of the full Lorentz group, time reversal and space inversion has to <b>dealt</b> with separately.|$|E
5|$|In Germany and Illyricum, {{the legions}} were in mutiny. In Germany, the legions in mutiny {{were those of}} the Lower Rhine under Aulus Caecina (the V Alaudae, XXI Rapax, I Germanica, and XX Valeria Victrix).

Germanicus <b>dealt</b> with the troops in Germania, and Tiberius' son Drusus <b>dealt</b> with Illyricum.|$|E

5|$|By the Han dynasty, {{written law}} had matured from its archaic form {{based largely on}} natural law and social customs into a {{rational}} corpus influenced by politics and based on positive law. However, the Han dynasty law code established by Chancellor Xiao He (d. 193 BCE) was largely an extension of an existing Qin dynasty law code. Evidence for this includes archaeological finds at Qin-era Shuihudi and Han-era Zhangjiashan. The nine chapters of the law code consisted of statutes which <b>dealt</b> with criminality, while two of these chapters <b>dealt</b> with court procedure. Although it survives only in small fragments, it was allegedly a massive written work on 960 written scrolls. The code had 26,272 articles written in 7,732,200 words that outlined punishments. There were 490 articles {{on the death penalty}} alone which contained 1,882 offenses and 3,472 analogies or pieces of case law.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s Notosusanto wrote extensively, {{focusing}} on essays but also writing poems and, later, short stories; {{the last of}} his creative works were written around 1956. He published four short story anthologies between 1958 and 1963. The first, Hudjan Kepagian (Morning Rain), consisted of six short stories. It <b>dealt</b> with the struggle against the Dutch colonists during the revolution. His second anthology, Tiga Kota (Three Cities), was published the following year and followed events in three cities: Rembang, Yogyakarta, and Jakarta.
