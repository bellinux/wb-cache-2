5|$|Rozhestvensky reorganized his ships {{into three}} divisions; the first {{consisted}} of the four new s commanded by himself, von Fölkersam commanded the second division of the battleships , Navarin, Sissoi Veliky and the armored cruiser , and Nebogatov retained his ships as the third division. Von Fölkersam, ill with cancer, died on 26 May and Rozhestvensky decided not to inform the fleet {{in order to keep}} morale up. The captain of Oslyabya became the commander of the 2nd Division while Nebogatov <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> he was now the squadron's de facto second-in-command.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the first}} episode to feature Jerry's parents. Only one casting session was {{performed}} to find the actors for the roles. Philip Sterling was originally cast {{to play the role}} of Morty Seinfeld, but was replaced with Phil Bruns. Bruns was then replaced as well because Seinfeld and David wanted the character to be harsher. As a result, the role was recast and given to Barney Martin — who <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> another actor had already established the part. In this episode Kramer greets Morty by name.|$|E
5|$|Between 1958 and 1964, the Merseyside {{area had}} about 500 {{different}} groups, which were constantly forming and breaking up, {{with an average}} of about 350 groups playing concerts on a regular basis. In 1961, Harry and the Cavern Club's DJ, Bob Wooler, compiled a list of groups that they had personally heard of, which had almost 300 names. In 1962, Mersey Beat held a poll to find out who was the most popular Merseyside group. When the votes were counted, Rory Storm & the Hurricanes were in first place, but after looking through the postal votes again, Harry noticed that forty votes were all written in green ink, in the same handwriting, and from the same area of Liverpool, so the dubious votes were declared void. This was suspected to have been Storm himself, but Harry <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the Beatles had done exactly the same thing.|$|E

5|$|The Halo series {{features}} voice work {{by television}} and film actors including Ron Perlman, Orlando Jones, Michelle Rodriguez, Robert Davi, and Terence Stamp. Voice acting became more important as Halo: Combat Evolveds sequels were developed; Halo 2 had 2,000 lines of combat dialogue, while Halo 3 has {{in excess of}} 14,000 lines. The actual technology for the trilogy changed very little; while some actors voiced their lines in remote locations, others traveled to Bungie to record their lines. In interviews, Halos voice actors stated that they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the games would become such a critical and commercial success. Steve Downes, {{the voice of the}} game's protagonist, stated that generally when a voice actor has finished their lines, their involvement with the game ends. As the characters in Combat Evolved were relatively undefined, the voice actors were given leeway to develop their own style and personality.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine's failure, several related systems failed. The number one hydraulic system, powered by the number one engine, failed but continued to operate via motor pumps that mechanically connected it to hydraulic system three. Hydraulic system three was also damaged and began leaking fluid but maintained pressure and operation up until impact. Hydraulic system two was undamaged. The number one electrical bus, whose generator {{was attached to the}} number one engine, failed, causing several electrical systems to go offline, most notably the captain's instruments, his stick shaker, and the slat disagreement sensors. While a switch in the overhead panel would have allowed the captain to restore power to his instruments, it was not used. It might have been possible for the flight engineer to reach the backup power switch (as part of an abnormal situation checklist – not as part of their take-off emergency procedure) in an effort to restore electrical power to the number one electrical bus. That would have worked only if electrical faults were no longer present in the number one electrical system. Furthermore, to reach the switch the flight engineer would have had to rotate his seat, release his safety belt, and stand up. Since the aircraft never got higher than 350 feet (110 m) above ground and was in the air for only 50 seconds between when the engine separated and when it crashed, there was not sufficient time to take such an action. In any event, the first officer was flying the airplane and his instruments continued to function normally. As the wings and engines were not visible from the cockpit, the crew likely <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> an engine had fallen off, only that one had failed.|$|E
25|$|The {{ancient world}} <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> male semen and female ovum were both needed {{to form a}} fetus; instead they thought that the male {{contribution}} in reproduction consisted {{of some sort of}} formative or generative principle. According {{to the understanding of the}} time, Mary's bodily fluids would provide all the matter that was needed for Jesus' bodily form, including his male sex.|$|E

He had opposed these tendencies as soon as they appeared after the war.|$|E
25|$|The Rubashkin {{family was}} {{reported}} to have denied any criminal activity; Aaron Rubashkin said that “he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> his workers were illegal and that they had produced what appeared to be legitimate work documents”. Nevertheless, he announced shortly after the raid that he intends to replace his son as the company's CEO. Sholom Rubashkin remained in charge though. He was finally replaced as CEO in September 2008 by Bernard Feldman, a New York attorney who had worked as counsel for the family, after child labor charges against Aaron and Sholom Rubashkin had been announced, and the Orthodox Union had threatened to withdraw their kosher certification.|$|E

He stated that if he became a Member of Parliament for Bruce, he would endeavour to act in a straightforward manner. In response to questions, Burns stated that he was an advocate for free trade. He also stated that he was against separationism, the act of dividing the North and South Islands, and that although he supported the use of income tax, he was against a stamp act or newspaper postage.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, al-Zawahiri {{married his}} first wife, Azza Ahmed Nowari, {{a student at}} Cairo University who was {{studying}} philosophy. Their wedding, which {{was held at the}} Continental Hotel in Opera Square, was very conservative, with separate areas for both men and women, and no music, photographs, or light-hearted humour. Many years later, when the United States attacked Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks in October 2001, Azza apparently <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> al-Zawahiri had supposedly been a jihadi emir (commander) for the last decade. In June 2012, one of Zawahiri's four wives, Umaima Hassan, released a statement on the internet congratulating the role played by Muslim women in the Arab Spring.|$|E
25|$|Wood had a {{long-term}} relationship with actress and songwriter Dolores Fuller, whom he met in late 1952. The two lived together for a time and Wood cast Fuller in three of his films: Glen or Glenda, Jail Bait and Bride of the Monster. Fuller later said she initially <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> Wood was a crossdresser and was mortified when she saw Wood dressed as a woman in Glen or Glenda. The couple broke up in 1955 after Wood cast another actress in the lead role of Bride of the Monster (Wood originally wrote the part for Fuller and reduced her part to a 1-minute cameo) and because of Wood's excessive drinking.|$|E
25|$|Milroy, {{despite the}} engagements up to point, still <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> {{he was facing}} the entire Second Corps of Lee's Army. Milroy {{concentrated}} all of his forces in the three forts defending the town. Having feared exactly this type of a scenario, General-in-chief Henry W. Halleck had asked Schenck to order Milroy to fall back from Winchester to Harpers Ferry. Although Schenck had discussed evacuation with Milroy, he left no clear direction for Milroy to evacuate, since Milroy had convinced Schenck that his defensive position in Winchester was strong. Milroy had previously decided to disregard concerns from Washington because he was confident that {{the strength of his}} fortifications would allow his garrison to withstand an assault or a siege.|$|E

25|$|Becky Sharp says {{farewell}} to the Sedley family and enters {{the service of the}} crude and profligate baronet Sir Pitt Crawley, who has engaged her as a governess to his daughters. Her behaviour at Sir Pitt's house gains his favour, and after the premature death of his second wife, he proposes marriage to her. However he finds that she has secretly married his second son, Captain Rawdon Crawley. (Becky very much regrets having done that; however, when she married Rawdon she <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> his father's wife would die so soon after). Sir Pitt's elder half sister, the spinster Miss Crawley, is very rich, having inherited her mother's fortune, and the whole Crawley family compete for her favour so she will bequeath them her wealth. Initially her favourite is Rawdon Crawley. But his marriage with Becky enrages her. First she favours the family of Sir Pitt's brother, but when she dies, she has left her money to Sir Pitt's oldest son, also called Pitt.|$|E
25|$|Eraserheads went onstage {{for their}} reunion concert on August 30, 2008 at The Fort Open Field, Taguig City. The concert, however, {{was cut short}} halfway through a planned 30-song setlist as Buendia {{was rushed to the}} Makati Medical Hospital after {{experiencing}} chest pains. He was reported to be in stable condition. Buddy Zabala had checked on Buendia in his tent right after they went to their planned 20 minute break and saw that he already was on an oxygen mask with paramedics checking his blood pressure. As he left and came back, paramedics were already taking Buendia on an ambulance. Bandmates Zabala, Marasigan and Adoro further said that they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> Buendia was already having difficulty performing. In the spirit of the reunion, Marasigan, Zabala and Adoro went to Saguijo after the concert and they continued their sets there. Kris Gorra-Dancel, Ebe Dancel, Aia De Leon and many other OPM artists joined them as well. During the concert, Jazz Nicolas of the Itchyworms and a close friend of the band, also joined the band and played synths, keyboards, and other back-up instruments.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of August 18, ten senior generals of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam met to discuss the {{situation}} and decided that martial law {{would need to be}} imposed. On August 20, Nhu summoned seven of the generals to Gia Long Palace for consultation. They presented their request to impose martial law and discussed dispersion of the monks. Nhu sent the generals to see Diệm. The president listened to the group of seven, led by General Trần Văn Đôn. Đôn claimed that Communists had infiltrated the monks at Xá Lợi Pagoda and warned that ARVN morale was deteriorating because of the civil unrest. He claimed that it was possible that the Buddhists could assemble a crowd to march on Gia Long Palace. Hearing this, Diệm agreed to declare martial law effective on the next day, without consulting his cabinet. Troops were ordered into Saigon to occupy strategic points. Đôn was appointed as the acting Chief of the Armed Forces in the place of General Lê Văn Tỵ, who was abroad having medical treatment. Don noted that Diệm was apparently concerned with the welfare of the monks, telling the generals {{that he did not want}} any of them hurt. The martial law orders were authorized with the signature of Đôn, who <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> military action was to occur in the early hours of August 21 without his knowledge.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Henry {{is taken}} by Greg and Tamara through the jungle. Henry points out their unfounded trust in Peter Pan, a {{statement}} which begins to worry {{them when they}} discover the walkie-talkie they use {{to communicate with the}} Home Office is filled with sand. The Lost Boys soon find them, and reveal themselves to be the Home Office Greg and Tamara worked for, much to their displeasure. The leader of the Lost Boys, Felix, reveals that the plan was never to destroy magic, and that Greg and Tamara aren't meant to return to their world. The Shadow arrives and rips Greg's shadow from his body when he refuses to hand over Henry, and Tamara is shot with an arrow. Henry flees in the confusion, and is taken aside by a fellow runaway. The runaway reveals that he was a former Lost Boy, and stole pixie dust from Pan, hoping to escape from Neverland. However, he cannot make himself fly with it. Gold arrives {{at the scene of the}} skirmish, and finds Tamara still alive. She tells him that Henry ran, and that she and Greg <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> they were working for Pan. She also apologizes about Neal, but Gold crushes her heart. He and Felix meet in a clearing, with Felix welcoming Gold but warning him that if he is in Neverland for Henry, that makes him Pan's enemy. Rumpelstiltskin remarks that nothing has changed, and scoffs at the idea of his survival, only wanting to take down as many Lost Boys as he can before he dies. Felix responds by leaving behind a doll of a child, which reduces Rumpelstiltskin to tears.|$|E
