50|$|Petrol interceptors work on {{the premise}} that some {{hydrocarbons}} such as petroleum and diesel float on the top of water. The contaminated water enters the interceptor typically after flowing off roads or forecourts and entering a channel drain before being deposited into the first tank inside the interceptor. The first tank builds up a layer of the hydrocarbon as well as other scum. Typically petrol interceptors have 3 separate tanks each connected with a <b>dip</b> <b>pipe,</b> as more liquid enters the interceptor the water enters into the second tank leaving the majority of the hydrocarbon behind as it cannot enter the <b>dip</b> <b>pipe,</b> whose opening into the second tank is below the surface. However some of the contaminants may by chance enter the second tank. This second tank will not build up as much of the hydrocarbon on its surface. As before, the water is pushed into the third tank and more water enters the second. The third tank should be practically clear of any hydrocarbon floating on its surface. As a precaution, the outlet pipe is also a <b>dip</b> <b>pipe.</b> When the water leaves the third tank via the outlet pipe it should be contaminant free.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe new {{fabrication}} {{method to}} fabricate porous aluminum alloys with aligned unidirectional pores {{was invented by}} <b>dipping</b> <b>pipes</b> into semi-solid slurry. Pure aluminum <b>pipes</b> were <b>dipped</b> into Al- 4 mass% Cu liquid and semi-solid slurry of base metal in an electric furnace. The base metal and <b>dipped</b> <b>pipes</b> were cooled and solidified together in the air. The pipes were bonded to the base metal and the original shape of the pipes was maintained by using the semi-solid slurry of the base metal. However, pipes are usually ruptured and buried in the liquid base metal during the process. On the other hand, {{it is possible to}} avoid the rupturing of pipes by using the semi-solid slurry because thermal damage of pipes can be reduced by an increase in solid fraction of the base metal. The analysis results of Electron Probe MicroAnalyser showed that Cu diffused into grain boundaries of pipes, which decreased the melting temperature of surface of pipes. As a result, the α phase melted partly and then the pipes were bonded with the base metal metallurgically. This dipping method can fabricate porous Al-Cu alloys with aligned unidirectional pores with porosity of 33 % when nineteen pipes are used...|$|R

40|$|The current (March 2008 to February 2009) summit eruptive {{activity}} at Kilauea Volcano {{is characterized by}} explosive degassing bursts accompanied by very long period (VLP) seismic signals. We model the source mechanisms of VLP signals in the 10 – 50 s band using data recorded for 15 bursts with a 10 ‐station broadband network deployed in the summit caldera. To determine the source centroid location and source mechanism, we minimize the residual error between data and synthetics calculated by the finite difference method for a point source embedded in a homogeneous medium that takes topography into account. The VLP signals associated with the bursts originate in a source region ∼ 1 km below the eastern perimeter of Halemaumau pit crater. The observed waveforms are well explained by {{the combination of a}} volumetric component and a vertical single force component. For the volumetric component, several source geometries are obtained which equally explain the observed waveforms. These geometries include (1) a <b>pipe</b> <b>dipping</b> 64 ° to the northeast; (2) two intersecting cracks including an east striking crack (dike) dipping 80 ° to the north, intersecting a north striking crack (another dike) dipping 65 ° to the east; (3) a <b>pipe</b> <b>dipping</b> 58 ° to the northeast, intersecting a crack dipping 48 ° to the west–southwest; and (4) a <b>pipe</b> <b>dipping</b> 57 ° to the northeast, intersecting a <b>pipe</b> <b>dipping</b> 58 ° to the west–southwest. Using the dual‐crack model as reference, the largest volume change obtained among the 15 bursts is ∼ 24, 400 m 3, and the maximum amplitude (peak to peak) of the force is ∼ 20 GN. Each burst is marked by a similar sequence of deflation and inflation, trailed by decaying oscillations of the volumetric source. The vertical force is initially upward, synchronous with source deflation, then downward, synchronous with source reinflation, followed by oscillations with polarity opposite to the volumetric oscillations. This combination of force and volume change is attributed to pressure and momentum changes induced during a fluid dynamic source mechanism involving the ascent, expansion, and burst of a large slug of gas within the upper ∼ 150 m of the magma conduit. As the slug expands upon approach to the surface and more liquid becomes wall supported by viscous shear forces, the pressure below the slug decreases, inducing conduit deflation and an upward force on the Earth. The final rapid slug expansion and burst stimulate VLP and LP oscillations of the conduit system, which slowly decay due to viscous dissipation and elastic radiation. Consideration of the fluid dynamic arguments leads us to prefer the dual‐crack VLP source model as it is the only candidate model capable of producing plausible values of length scales and pressure changes. The magnitudes of the vertical forces observed in the 15 bursts appear consistent with slug masses of 104 to 106 kg...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Deformation {{behavior}} of porous aluminum alloys with aligned unidirectional pores through equal-channel angular extrusion (ECAE) was investigated. The porous aluminum alloys were fabricated by <b>dipping</b> pure aluminum <b>pipes</b> into semi-solid slurry base metal. The pipes did not detach {{from the base}} metal even through the ECAE process. Comparing the sample dimension of pores before and after ECAE process, the amount of decrease in a dimension of pores was 19. 4 % in this study. The Vickers hardness increased by work hardening. Especially, the hardness value of area where plastic flow arose increased significantly. These results show that we can improve the mechanical properties with maintenance of the porous structure and measure {{the amount of the}} sample deformation quantitatively...|$|R

40|$|The El Mochito mine, {{located in}} west-central Honduras, {{exploits}} a distal Zn-Pb-Ag skarn-hosted deposit. The bulk of economic mineralization, occurring either as steeply <b>dipping</b> <b>pipes</b> or flat-lying manto bodies, is hosted by Cretaceous Atima Formation limestone. Skarn mineralogy consists of early grossularitic garnet followed by andraditic garnet and hedenbergitic pyroxene, with pyroxene skarn the principal host to sphalerite mineralization. Ore minerals, which post-dated silicate precipitation, comprise sphalerite of variable Fe content, galena, magnetite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, pyrite and trace amounts of arsenopyrite. The distribution of ore metals in the orebodies is zoned from Zn-Fe-rich cores to adjacent Pb- and Ag-rich zones reflecting the sequential saturation of sphalerite and galena in the fluid with decreasing temperature. Skarn formation {{was accompanied by}} significant additions of Si, Fe, Mg, Al, and Mn and variable changes in Ca during early alteration. Apparent decreases in the concentrations of Ti and Zr suggest that the fluid:rock ratio was high. Variations in component activities of the hydrothermal fluid indicate that andraditic garnet skarn was stable at lower log(aCa 2 +/aH+ 2), log(aAl 3 +/aH+ 3), and log aSiO 2 aq, and higher log(aFe 3 +/aH+ 3) than its grossularitic garnet skarn precursor, whereas hedenbergitic pyroxene skarn was stable at lower log(aCa 2 +/aH+ 2) and log(aFe 3 +/aH+ 3) and higher log aSiO 2 aq than its andraditic skarn precursor. delta 34 S values of sphalerite, galena and pyrrhotite cluster between - 1 and + 2 ‰, and their corresponding fluid delta 34 SH 2 S values ranged from - 3. 7 to + 5. 4 ‰, indicating that the sulphur was primarily igneous in origin, and lead isotope ratios of galena {{are similar to those}} of the Miocene-Pliocene Padre Miguel ignimbrite. Variation in the delta 34 S values of sphalerite and the whole-rock Pb isotope ratios of the host limestone are interpreted to reflect decreasing alteration toward the southwest. Microthermometric measurements for garnet-, pyroxene- and sphalerite-hosted fluid inclusions indicate that two end-member fluids, a saline formational brine and a Fe-rich orthomagmatic fluid, formed skarn and ore at the deposit. The first, hosted by grossularitic garnet and low-Fe sphalerite, is characterized by homogenization temperatures ranging from 260 to 390 °C, and salinities from 7 to 45 wt. % NaCl equivalent. The second, hosted by pyroxene, andraditic garnet, and medium-Fe sphalerite, is characterized by a higher homogenization temperature (320 to 400 °C), lower salinity (1 to 15 wt. % NaCl equivalent) and an elevated Fe concentration.

40|$|Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) is {{a growing}} method for {{installation}} of pipes in urban areas and where trenching is impossible or undesirable; such as in crossing rivers, lakes, railways, and runways in airports. This technique utilizes down-hole cutting heads to create a pilot borehole before it is enlarged with back reamers to allow pulling back of a product pipe. The utilization of HDD for the installation of underground infrastructure (i. e., water, wastewater, oil and gas pipes, telecommunication, and power conduits), has shown a rapid growth compared to other trenchless technologies. HDD can install a range of pipe diameters from 2 to 60 inches utilizing different pipe materials including steel, high density polyethylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and ductile iron <b>pipe</b> (<b>DIP)</b> with minimum surface and daily life disruptions. Estimation of HDD productivity, project duration, and quantity of materials required, is a difficult task due to variable productivity conditions such soil, project, contractor, and machine conditions involved in operation.

40|$|Several large {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that theliability to smoke cigarettes is strongly genetically influenced. However, the role of genetic and environ-mental risk factors in the use of other common forms of tobacco use has yet to be studied. Data on the regular use of cigarettes, cigars, <b>pipes,</b> <b>dip</b> (moist snuff), and chewing tobacco from 2634 male twins were analyzed with ACE structural equation models. Twin similarity for regular cigarette and dip use was largely genetic in origin. However, twin resemblance for chewing tobacco was just about equally the result of genes and shared environment, and twin similarity for use of pipes and cigars was entirely the result of shared environmental factors. Thus, the genetic influ-ences on the liability for regular tobacco use appear to vary based on tobacco type. The causes for the use of different forms of tobacco are complex and worthy of further study. Previous investigations on the genetic epidemiology of cigarette use have provided evidence that genetic factors strongly influence the liability for cigarette smoking (Li et al., 2003; Sullivan & Kendler, 1999; Tyndale, 2003). A recent meta-analysis suggests that genetic factors account for approximately 60 % of the liability for cigarette smoking initiation, and for 70 % of the liability for nicotine dependence (Sullivan & Kendler, 1999). There have been, to our knowledge, no investigations into the role of genetic and environmen-tal risk factors for the use of tobacco forms other than cigarettes, despite evidence that noncigarette forms of tobacco use also pose substantial health risks. In this report, we investigate the genetic and environmental contributions to the liability to use the five common forms of tobacco in a population-based sample of male–male twin pairs...|$|R
40|$|The Proposed Decision and Need The Knoxville Utilities Board (KUB) {{proposes to}} replace a section of an {{existing}} sewer line originally installed in 1947. The proposed sewer line crosses Fort Loudoun Reservoir at Tennessee River Mile (TRM) 646. 6 in Knox County, Tennessee (Figure 1), at a point slightly upstream of the existing line’s location. The new sewer line would consist of two ductile iron <b>pipes</b> (<b>DIP)</b> that would be installed using a conventional cut-and-cover method in a 3. 5 -foot-deep trench below the riverbed. A temporary emergency bypass line would be anchored on the river bottom to prevent overflow during rain events. In addition, due to planned rehabilitation of the nearby Henley Street Bridge in 2010, KUB proposes to remove the existing 16 -inch water main currently affixed to the bridge and install the water main within the same trench as the proposed new sewer line. Other components of the project include the installation of two concrete manhole junction boxes {{on either side of}} the proposed crossing route and associated sewer pipes and manholes as shown in the conceptual layout (Figure 2). The decision before Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is whether to issue approval under Section 26 a of the TVA Act for the installation of the sewer line and water main crossing beneath the marked navigation channel of the Tennessee River. The proposed project involves a small area of TVA property currently under easement along Neyland Drive and would affect land over which TVA has flowage easement rights on the opposite shore. TVA is not proposing to convey any property rights to KUB. As a result, no land action is associated with the request. Other Environmental Reviews and Documentation The U. S.

40|$|Volcanic rocks {{along the}} Panama Canal present a {{world-class}} {{opportunity to examine}} the relationship between arc magmatism, tectonic forcing, wet and dry magmas, and volcanic structures. Major and trace element geochemistry of Canal volcanic rocks indicate a significant petrologic transition at 21 - 25 Ma. Oligocene Bas Obispo Fm. rocks have large negative Nb-Ta anomalies, low HREE, fluid mobile element enrichments, a THI of 0. 88, and a H 2 Ocalc of > 3 wt. %. In contrast, the Miocene Pedro Miguel and Late Basalt Fm. exhibit reduced Nb-Ta anomalies, flattened REE curves, depleted fluid mobile elements, a THI of 1. 45, a H 2 Ocalc of < 1 wt. %, and plot in mid-ocean ridge/back-arc basin fields. Geochemical modeling of Miocene rocks indicates 0. 5 - 0. 1 kbar crystallization depths of hot (1100 - 1190 °C) magmas in which most compositional diversity can be explained by fractional crystallization (F = 0. 5). However, the most silicic lavas (Las Cascadas Fm.) require an additional mechanism, and assimilation-fractional-crystallization can reproduce observed compositions at reasonable melt fractions. The Canal volcanic rocks, therefore, change from hydrous basaltic pyroclastic deposits typical of mantle-wedge-derived magmas, to hot, dry bi-modal magmatism at the Oligocene-Miocene boundary. We suggest the primary reason for the change is onset of arc perpendicular extension localized to central Panama. High-resolution mapping along the Panama Canal has revealed a sequence of inward <b>dipping</b> maar-diatreme pyroclastic <b>pipes,</b> large basaltic sills, and bedded silicic ignimbrites and tuff deposits. These volcanic bodies intrude into the sedimentary Canal Basin and are cut by normal and subsequently strike-slip faults. Such pyroclastic pipes and basaltic sills are most common in extensional arc and large igneous province environments. Overall, the change in volcanic edifice form and geochemistry are related to onset of arc perpendicular extension, and are consistent with the idea that Panama arc crust fractured during collision with South America forming the observed Canal extensional zone...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 The {{first goal}} of this master’s thesis was to {{investigate}} the linkage between a non-destructive testing method, surface resistivity, and premature concrete deterioration brought on by chloride ingress and/or freeze-thaw cycling. The experimental method for this project consists of taking surface resistivity measurements of reinforced concrete slabs after they were ponded with a magnesium chloride de-icing solution, containing a corrosion inhibitor. Reinforced concrete slabs and companion concrete cylinders also underwent freeze/thaw cycling to observe its effect on surface resistivity in conjunction with exposure to chlorides. Many factors such as internal and ambient temperature and relative humidity affect surface resistivity measurements so this data was also collected. To compare the surface resistivity to the rate of chloride ingress, cores were taken from the slabs. As expected, the surface resistivity of the concrete slabs initially increased while the concrete cured and lost moisture due to the hydration process and to the environment. Once ponding of the chloride solution started, however, there began to be a decrease in surface resistivity. This decrease in surface resistivity is believed to be caused by the increase of free chlorides present in the slabs after being saturated with the de-icing solution. The surface resistivity of the corresponding slabs that were ponded with tap water remained constant. These results show that surface resistivity measurements are a potential indicator of chloride ingress and, therefore, may correlate to risk of corrosion in reinforced concrete. The effect of freeze/thaw cycling on surface resistivity, according to this study, is that it increases the surface resistivity. This is due to the micro-cracking in the concrete matrix, caused by the freeze-thaw damage. In the second part of this master’s thesis the corrosion susceptibility of ductile iron <b>pipe</b> (<b>DIP)</b> was investigated. Ductile iron pipe has been used mostly in the water transmission field since the 1950 s. At that time, ductile iron pipe replaced traditional cast iron pipe, due to ductile iron’s superior strength properties. More recently, ductile iron pipe has been considered as a replacement for traditional timber poles for power transmission. While there are benefits to using ductile iron such as its strength and sustainability, ductile iron suffers from pitting corrosion due to the nodular structure of its free graphite. This type of corrosion can lead to severe deterioration of the pipe in localized areas. Due to this, researchers have been studying ductile iron durability and developing solutions for its durability issues. In this research study ductile iron was tested for its susceptibility to corrosion. Samples were subjected to an accelerated corrosion process inside a salt fog chamber. After the samples had corroded, mass loss measurements were taken. Tensile strength tests were also done before and after corrosion. Stainless steel samples were tested alongside the ductile iron for comparison. In addition to the corrosion chamber and strength tests, electrochemical tests were done to characterize the corrosion kinetics of ductile iron. Stainless steel samples showed almost no change in mass loss and tensile strength after corrosion. Ductile iron samples, on the other hand, had a corrosion rate of approximately 52. 6 mpy (1. 3 mmy), and a 10 ksi (69 MPa) decrease in ultimate tensile strength after corrosion. Open circuit potential results showed that the ductile iron samples had a higher potential, and thus, lower corrosion resistance than the stainless steel samples. Similarly, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that stainless steel had a greater impedance than ductile iron, which correlates to increased corrosion resistance. Analysis of cyclic polarization curves showed that the ductile iron samples had much higher corrosion rates than stainless steel samples. However, the corrosion products which formed on the ductile iron samples appeared to be protective in nature. This indicates that ductile iron may have good field performance...|$|R
