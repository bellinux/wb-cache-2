5|$|In Philadelphia, Maeser was {{commissioned}} by the church to develop pamphlets on basic church principles. After living there a few weeks, Maeser was called {{to serve as a}} missionary by the LDS Church to the <b>German-speaking</b> <b>community</b> of Philadelphia. Maeser spent some time in Virginia as part of his mission, where he earned keep for himself and his family by giving music lessons. Among Maeser's music students were the daughters of former United States President John Tyler. Maeser returned with Anna to Philadelphia, where he was called by the church to serve as conference president. Maeser and his family left Philadelphia in June 1860 and traveled across the country to Salt Lake City in Patriarch John Smith's company. Maeser arrived in Utah Territory on September 1, 1860.|$|E

50|$|Edgar Meyer was {{a proponent}} of the germanisation of Trentino and the {{corridor}} beyond leading to the Adriatic Sea. These areas contained a string of <b>German-speaking</b> <b>communities.</b> This was {{against a backdrop of}} rising Italian nationalism or irrendentism.|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from the}} yearly meeting, {{national}} communities have been organizing local gatherings at various levels; most notably, the <b>German-speaking</b> <b>community</b> has once been hosted at the European Central Bank headquarters in Frankfurt am Main in April 2007. The visit was repeated in April 2012, during an international meeting.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the site}} was {{available}} only in German and hence it {{used to have a}} majority of users being from Germanic countries; such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.

25|$|Education is {{provided}} by the Communities, Dutch in the Flemish Community (Flanders and Brussels), French in the French Community (Wallonia and Brussels), German in the <b>German-speaking</b> <b>community.</b> Instruction in other languages is prohibited in government-funded schools (except for foreign language subjects of course, and in higher education where English is increasingly used).|$|E
50|$|Burridge's {{work has}} mainly focused on Pennsylvania <b>German-speaking</b> <b>communities</b> in Canada, {{grammatical}} change in Germanic languages, {{the nature of}} euphemism and dysphemism, linguistic taboo, and on English grammatical structure in general.

5000|$|The Boerenbond (Dutch, or Bauernbund; {{literally}} [...] "Farmers' League") is {{a professional}} association of farmers, active in Belgium's Flemish and <b>German-speaking</b> <b>communities.</b> Founded in 1890 and based in Leuven, the Boerenbond is an organisation promotes the interests of farmers working within its regions of activity.|$|R
25|$|French is {{the major}} {{language}} spoken in Wallonia. German is spoken in the <b>German-speaking</b> <b>Community</b> of Belgium, in the east. Belgian French is rather similar to that spoken in France, with slight differences in pronunciation and some vocabulary differences, notably {{the use of the}} words septante (70) and nonante (90), as opposed to soixante-dix and quatre-vingt-dix in France.|$|E
25|$|Total Dutch {{speakers}} are 6.23million, {{concentrated in}} the northern Flanders region, while French speakers number 3.32million in Wallonia and an estimated 870,000 (or 85%) in the officially bilingual Brussels-Capital Region. The <b>German-speaking</b> <b>Community</b> {{is made up of}} 73,000 people in the east of the Walloon Region; around 10,000 German and 60,000 Belgian nationals are speakers of German. Roughly 23,000 more German speakers live in municipalities near the official Community.|$|E
25|$|German is {{the least}} {{prevalent}} official language in Belgium, spoken natively by less than 1% of the population. The <b>German-speaking</b> <b>Community</b> of Belgium numbers 77,000, residing {{in an area of}} Belgium that was ceded by the former German Empire as part of the Treaty of Versailles, which concluded World War I. In 1940, Nazi Germany re-annexed the region following its invasion of Belgium during World War II; after the war it was returned to Belgium.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} feature of the Belgian context is the ‘communautarisation’ 2 of education policies.

50|$|The Surselva {{is one of}} the {{few areas}} in Switzerland that is mainly Romansh-speaking (another notable valley being the Engadine, the valley of the Inn). There are a few <b>German-speaking</b> <b>communities</b> in the Surselva, e.g. Disentis/Mustér, with its Benedictine monastery, which dates back to 720, Obersaxen and Vals, which were founded in the thirteenth century by the Walser.|$|R
25|$|The {{overlapping}} {{boundaries of}} the Regions and Communities have created two notable peculiarities: {{the territory of the}} Brussels-Capital Region (which came into existence nearly a decade after the other regions) is included in both the Flemish and French Communities, and the territory of the <b>German-speaking</b> <b>Community</b> lies wholly within the Walloon Region. Conflicts about jurisdiction between the bodies are resolved by the Constitutional Court of Belgium. The structure is intended as a compromise to allow different cultures to live together peacefully.|$|E
25|$|The second-most spoken primary (Belgian) language, used {{natively}} {{by almost}} 40% of the population, is French. It {{is the official}} language of the French Community (which, like the Flemish Community, is a political entity), the dominant language in Wallonia (having also a small <b>German-speaking</b> <b>Community)</b> {{as well as the}} Brussels-Capital Region. Almost all of the inhabitants of the Capital region speak French as either their primary language (50%) or as a lingua franca (45%). There are also many Flemish people who speak French as a second language. Belgian French is in most respects identical to standard, Parisian French, but differs in some points of vocabulary, pronunciation, and semantics.|$|E
25|$|Belgium {{currently}} {{operates a}} complex federal system {{between the two}} main groups: Flemish and Walloons. There's a division of Belgium into three regions, where Brussels-Capital Region is an independent region, next to Flanders and Wallonia. The regions are mostly responsible for the economy, mobility and other territory-related matters. But there's also a division of Belgium into three communities: the Flemish Community, the French Community and the <b>German-speaking</b> <b>Community.</b> These communities are responsible for language-related matters like culture or education. Brussels doesn't belong to any community, but has a bilingual status. So the Brussels inhabitants may enjoy education or cultural affairs or education organised by the Flemish and/or the French community.|$|E
5000|$|The German Catholic priest [...] {{wrote the}} {{original}} German lyrics in 1771 as a paraphrase of the Te Deum, a Christian hymn in Latin from the 4th century. It became an inherent part of major Christian ceremonial occasions, mainly as a conclusion song. Due to its memorable melody and theme {{it is one}} of the most popular hymns and prevalent in <b>German-speaking</b> <b>communities.</b>|$|R
5000|$|German Fest {{celebrates the}} culture, food, travel, {{and history of}} Germany, [...] as well as Switzerland, Austria, Liechtenstein, South Tyrol, and <b>German-speaking</b> <b>communities</b> around the world. Along with {{traditional}} music, many from the Europe also make the journey to perform and educate at the festival. The Junge Kameraden Band from Plymouth High School led by the highly acclaimed band director, Jason Sebranek, traditionally performs at German Fest annually.|$|R
50|$|German and Bavarian dialects {{have been}} {{autochthonous}} since present-day Slovenia {{came under the}} rule of Bavaria in the 8th century. Whereas many immigrants from German-speaking areas adopted Slovene over the centuries, others retained their language. Until the 20th century, the most numerous <b>German-speaking</b> <b>communities</b> were found in the urban centers of Lower Styria, in the Gottschee County in southern Slovenia and in the villages around Apače (Apaško polje) along the Mura river.|$|R
25|$|The second state reform {{took place}} in 1980, when the {{cultural}} communities became Communities. The Communities assumed the competencies of the cultural communities with regard to cultural matters, and became responsible for the 'matters relating to the person', such as health and youth policy. From then on, these three Communities were known as the Flemish Community, the French Community and the <b>German-speaking</b> <b>Community.</b> Two Regions were established as well in 1980: the Flemish Region and the Walloon Region. However, in Flanders it was decided in 1980 to immediately merge {{the institutions of the}} Community and the Region. Although the creation of a Brussels Region was provided for in 1970, the Brussels-Capital Region was not established until the third state reform.|$|E
500|$|Like many of Müller's books, The Land of Green Plums {{illustrates}} {{the position of}} dissidents from the German minority in Romania, who suffered a double oppression under the regime of Nicolae Ceauşescu. The rural <b>German-speaking</b> <b>community</b> tries to preserve its culture by enforcing traditional rules; once the main characters escape this environment through university study in the city, they suffer, as political dissidents, the oppression exercised by the totalitarian regime. Those who flee the country for Germany become [...] cultural outcasts: they are not considered German there but rather Eastern Europeans. Critics read the novel as testifying to abuse and the ensuing trauma. Normal human relationships are rendered impossible {{by the lack of}} freedom of expression; the threat of violence, imprisonment, and execution; and the possibility that any personal friend may be a traitor. Written in a paratactic style, full of flashbacks and time shifts, the language of the book reflects trauma and political oppression.|$|E

5000|$|German {{migration}} to New Zealand in the 19th century was less pronounced than migration from Britain, Ireland, {{and perhaps even}} Scandinavia. Despite this there were significant pockets of <b>German-speaking</b> <b>communities</b> which lasted until {{the first decades of}} the 20th century. German-speakers settled principally in Puhoi, Nelson, and Gore. At the last census (2006), 37,500 people in New Zealand spoke German, making it the third most spoken European language after English and French and overall the ninth most spoken language.|$|R

25|$|The German {{settlers}} came {{primarily from}} Russia, and after 1914 from German-American settlements in North and South Dakota. They came not as large groups but {{as part of}} a chain of family members, where the first immigrants would find suitable locations and send for the others. They formed compact <b>German-speaking</b> <b>communities</b> built around their Catholic or Lutheran churches, and continuing old-world customs. They were farmers who grew wheat. Arrivals from Russia, Bukovina, and Romanian Dobruja established their villages in a 40-mile-wide tract east of Regina.|$|R

25|$|Education is {{compulsory}} from 6 to 18 {{years of}} age for Belgians. Among OECD countries in 2002, Belgium had the third highest proportion of 18- to 21-year-olds enrolled in postsecondary education, at 42%. Though an estimated 99% {{of the adult population}} is literate, concern is rising over functional illiteracy. The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), coordinated by the OECD, currently ranks Belgium's education as the 19th best in the world, being significantly higher than the OECD average. Education being organized separately by each, the Flemish Community scores noticeably above the French and <b>German-speaking</b> <b>Communities.</b>|$|R
50|$|During {{the fourth}} period, from 1933 to 1940, Argentina {{experienced}} another surge in German immigration. The majority were German Jews although other German opponents of Nazism also came. In total, 45,000 German speakers came {{at this time}} and half settled in Buenos Aires. From 1933 to 1945, they comprised 28% of total immigration to Argentina, as mass migration to Argentina was slowing. Two recent German studies have been written on these arrivals’ impact on Das Argentinische Tageblatt and how the newspaper was used by anti-Nazi immigrants within the Argentine <b>German-speaking</b> <b>community’s</b> debate about fascism.|$|R
50|$|The Swiss {{variant of}} French is {{characterized}} by some terms adopted from Franco-Provençal, a language formerly spoken largely across the alpine communities of Romandie and maintained by a minority today, as well as expressions borrowed from Swiss and Standard German. While Standard French is taught in schools and used in government, media, and business, there is no uniform vernacular form of French among the different cantons of Switzerland. This is exemplified by the usage of borrowed terms from German in regions bordering <b>German-speaking</b> <b>communities</b> to their complete absence by the French border area around Geneva.|$|R
