25|$|The coastal {{land masses}} are formed or {{modified}} both by {{action of the}} sea currents and tides, and by the rainwater flow through the estuaries, from the rivers and backwater systems, supplying sediments. Deposition or erosion of coastal areas are common and dynamic. Sea erosion claims land in some areas with the <b>eroded</b> <b>soil</b> being deposited in other areas. Severe floods and tidal changes have caused more abrupt and drastic transformations at times. The Cochin estuary itself {{is said to have}} resulted from the floods of 1341, which caused the silting up of the ancient harbor of Muziris and the opening of the channel at Cochin Azhi.|$|E

25|$|As coffee {{becomes one}} of the most {{important}} export crops in certain regions such as northern Latin America, nature and agriculture are transformed. Increased productivity requires technological innovations, and the coffee agroecosystem has been changing rapidly. In the nineteenth century in Latin America, coffee plantations slowly began replacing sugarcane and subsistence crops. Coffee crops became more managed; they were put into rows and unshaded, meaning diversity of the forest was decreased and Coffea trees were shorter. As plant and tree diversity decreased, so did animal diversity. Unshaded plantations allow for a higher density of Coffea trees, but negative effects include less protection from wind and more easily <b>eroded</b> <b>soil.</b> Technified coffee plantations also use chemicals such as fertilizers, insecticides, and fungicides.|$|E
25|$|Ecological {{succession}} {{is generally}} {{defined as the}} successive occupation of a site by different plant communities. In an accreting mudflats the outer community along the sequence represents the pioneer community which is gradually replaced by the next community representing the seral stages and finally by a climax community typical of the climatic zone. Robert Scott Troup suggested that succession began in the newly accreted land created by fresh deposits of <b>eroded</b> <b>soil.</b> The pioneer vegetation on these newly accreted sites is Sonneratia, followed by Avicennia and Nypa. As the ground is elevated {{as a result of}} soil deposition, other trees make their appearance. The most prevalent, though one of the late species to appear, is Excoecaria. As the level of land rises through accretion and the land is only occasionally flooded by tides, Heritiera fomes begins to appear.|$|E
500|$|In 1973, Joseph Miller, Jr., {{a retired}} Portland physician, sued the Forest Service, {{claiming}} that its logging violated the Bull Run Trespass Act. In 1976, U.S. District Judge James M. Burns agreed, and logging was halted. Shortly thereafter, Congress rescinded the Bull Run Trespass Act {{and replaced it}} with the Bull Run Watershed Management Act of 1977, which created the Bull Run Watershed Management Unit (BRWMU) (replacing the Bull Run Reserve) and legalized further Bull Run logging unless it could be shown to reduce water quality. Logging and the debate about logging continued. In 1994 about 75percent of the BRWMU was made into a reserve for protecting the northern spotted owl and other species dependent on old-growth forests. In February 1996, runoff from unusually heavy rains in the watershed washed so much <b>eroded</b> <b>soil</b> into the Bull Run storage reservoirs that the City had to shut down the Bull Run supply and switch during the crisis to its emergency supply from a well field along the Columbia River. Later in 1996, Congress passed the Oregon Resources Conservation Act, which prohibited logging on all Forest Service lands within the Bull Run water supply drainage and another [...] of land that drained to the lower Bull Run River. In 2001, the Little Sandy Act extended the prohibitions to the entire BRWMU and public lands along the Little Sandy River.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe soils of {{southern}} Guam are formed from very deep; well-drained Saprolite derived from volcanic based tuff and tuff breccias. These soils suffer severe erosion {{as the result}} of rapid overland flow, wind and intensive rain events typical {{of southern}} Guam. An integrated approach to control the accelerated soil erosion was designed to include conservation tillage, crop rotation with leguminous plant, and residue management for soil surface cover. The objectives of this study are; 1) to evaluate the use of crop rotation and tillage management for increasing organic-matter content to improve the overall quality of these severely <b>eroded</b> <b>soils,</b> 2) to evaluate the effect of conservation practices on harvested yield and crop productivity of these <b>eroded</b> <b>soils</b> and, 3) to assess the effects of conservation techniques including no-tillage systems on water runoff and infiltration.

40|$|Greenhouse {{and field}} {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} corn (Zea mays L.) to investigate (1) the effect of soil erosion on crop production from Sharpsburg and Wymore silty clay loam soils, and (2) the effect of soil erosion on some physical and chemical properties. The greenhouse study showed significantly higher dry matter yield on the slightly <b>eroded</b> <b>soils.</b> ^ Field studies on Wymore soils revealed a greater sensitivity {{to the level of}} erosion by grain sorghum than corn. However, corn yield in 1984 and 1985 was reduced for each erosion class change from slight to moderate to severe on Sharpsburg soil. Under severe drought conditions, as occurred in 1983, the results show 28 and 16 % higher yields on the severe and moderately <b>eroded</b> <b>soils</b> of Sharpsburg and Wymore, respectively. The loss of yield due to soil erosion was partly overcome or offset by nitrogen application. However, the effectiveness of nitrogen was dependent on weather conditions (especially rainfall) and therefore varied from one year to the next. ^ Definite relationships between erosion class and soil physical and chemical properties were observed. Clay content increased approximately 4 and 10 % on Sharpsburg and Wymore, respectively, for each erosion class change from slight to moderate to severe. The increase in bulk density observed in the more severely <b>eroded</b> <b>soils</b> paralleled the high clay content. Organic matter content decreased with increasing severity of soil erosion. Soil water retention differences among erosion levels were observed with the severe erosion level having the most water retained at - 1500, - 33 and - 10 kpa suctions. However, available water-holding capacity was highest when erosion was slight. ...|$|R
