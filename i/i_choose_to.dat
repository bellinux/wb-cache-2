5|$|Two events {{affected}} me most, one when a colleague dropped himself from second floor to escape under-covered police who stormed school. The second incident was when a dear teacher was arrested. That is when my voice started {{to rise and}} become annoying. I was caught vandalizing a school wall by writing apolitical human rights statements on school walls and was given the choice to either be submitted to police or to switch school. So I took {{the easy way out}} and since I was the top student back then, <b>I</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> switch to Sheikh Abdul Aziz school.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Diamonds" [...] is a {{departure}} from Rihanna's recurring themes of unhealthy relationships on her other songs, and contains a prominent concept of love. The first verse introduces the song's concept: [...] "Find light in the beautiful sea / <b>I</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> be happy / You and I, you and I / We're like diamonds in the sky." [...] The hook continues this metaphor: [...] "So shine bright, tonight, you and I / We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky / Eye to eye, so alive." [...] According to Glenn Yoder of The Boston Globe, the song shows Rihanna differently than how she is viewed by the public because of lyrics such as [...] "I choose to be happy" [...] and [...] "We're like diamonds in the sky". James Montgomery of MTV News commented that she embraces the positivity and fulfillment of a realized relationship, particularly with the line [...] "When you hold me, I'm alive", and admits [...] "I knew that we'd become one right away". Lindsay DiMattina of Hollywood.com interpreted that Rihanna is crying out for her lover when she sings lines such as, [...] "When you hold me, I'm alive," [...] and [...] "At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays / I saw the life inside your eyes." [...] The Herald Sun asserted that the lyrics were most likely inspired by Rihanna's private life.|$|E

500|$|In addition, Tessa {{shares with}} MacLeod the {{consequences}} of his involvement in the Game. She dislikes the Game and would like to escape from it with him, since she fears for his life. According to Vandernoot, Tessa [...] "...always thought that she [...] die before [...] ", but when he told her about the Game during [...] "The Gathering", [...] "she [...] that he [...] be killed", thus she avoided thinking about it. Another consequence of the Game is that Tessa is sometimes exposed to danger from Immortals who want to use her to pressure MacLeod. Despite being captured by Quince in [...] "The Gathering", by the time of [...] "Band of Brothers", she is able to face Grayson: [...] "If you think [...] will stand by, ...you have misjudged him terribly. So you'd better kill me, now, and be done with it." [...] Grayson releases her and calls her [...] "...a remarkable woman, well worth keeping alive." [...] Consequently, Tessa is fully aware of the risks of their relationship, but stays with MacLeod, explaining in [...] "Eyewitness" [...] that [...] "I know the risks <b>I</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> take...

His rise to fame has been used as [...] "a great example of how the emerging society gives extensive opportunities to individuals with great ideas, courage, and, of course, a significant portion of luck as opposed to the old society." [...] Studies of the gaming community on YouTube have shown that 95% of gamers engage in watching online videos related to gaming, which has been linked to be an important reason for PewDiePie's popularity. In 2015, PewDiePie was included on Time's list of the 30 most influential people on the Internet, cementing his influence as an internet personality. Later in 2015, PewDiePie was featured on the cover of Varietys [...] "Famechangers" [...] issue, with the magazine ranking him as the [...] "#1 Famechanger", or [...] "those whose influence stands head and shoulders above the rest".
