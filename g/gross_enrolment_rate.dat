40|$|The {{effect of}} public {{investment}} on {{economic growth is}} a popular topic in economic literature. Although there are endogenous growth models that incorporate public expenditure as a factor that promotes growth, findings in empirical literature provide conflicting results. This thesis contributes to this debate by providing a comprehensive analysis {{of the relationship between}} public investment and development by using a new panel dataset for Turkish provinces. For analyses, public investment is disaggregated as energy infrastructure, city infrastructure and security, education, health, transportation and communication, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, tourism and housing. The outcome variables are chosen as economic growth rate, the <b>gross</b> <b>enrolment</b> <b>rate</b> for primary and middle school, and the infant mortality rate. With regard to the econometric method, the fixed-effects technique is chosen. The dependent variables are calculated as the five-year forward moving averages of the outcome variables. Standard errors are corrected for serial correlation, cross-sectional dependence and heteroscedasticity. Findings in this thesis suggest that public investments in education, agriculture, tourism and energy infrastructure are associated with higher growth rates. There {{does not appear to be}} any statistical relationship between public city infrastructure and security investment and economic growth. However, public city infrastructure and security investment is related to the long-run <b>gross</b> <b>enrolment</b> <b>rate</b> positively, and the long-run infant mortality rate negatively. Additionally, public investment in energy infrastructure appears to have a negative relationship with the long-run infant mortality rate. Finally, results show that public investment in mining, transportation and communication are negatively related to the long run growth. The results provide partial support for the predictions of the model in Barro (1990) in the second chapter and the development literature in the third and the fourth chapters. Public policies in the sectors mentioned above arise as a factor that has an impact on the outcome of public investment.

The government wishes to increase the <b>gross</b> <b>enrolment</b> <b>rate</b> from 70 % to 85 % by 2014 and aims for universal 12 -year education by 2019. The approach adopted has been to: analyse current costs and funding arrangements through fieldwork and a review of secondary sources; consider the financing implications of achieving a set of minimum standards; review the current government funding provision; and examine a range of policy options {{for the expansion of}} senior secondary enrolments. The current funding of government senior secondary education is complex and varies throughout the country. It involves different levels of government providing financial support for infrastructure, salaries and operational costs. A common feature of the senior secondary sub-sector is its dependence on parental contributions. This has implications for school quality and for equity. The government's policy of designating some schools as 'international standard secondary schools' (RSBI) has inadvertently adversely affected equity. The study found considerable variation in the levels of cost and the amounts of available revenue among state senior secondary schools (SMA), with the RSBI being far better resourced than the rest. Salaries of government service teachers (PNS) are the responsibility of government. Those of teachers without PNS status, who are numerous in some schools, have to be paid for from other sources and almost invariably these costs fall on parents. The burden on parents comes in various forms. There are direct charges for fees and registration books and uniforms and there are indirect costs of transport and meals. There are also high opportunity costs of sending children to senior secondary school to set against the perceived returns of this level of schooling...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} the strategies for financing of higher education {{within the context of}} the massification thereof in China. The year 1999 was a turning point for the development of Chinese higher education. In that year the Chinese government decided to expand its higher education system rapidly. Since then Chinese higher education has experienced explosive expansion. The student enrolment in the Chinese higher education system increased from 5. 87 million in 1998 to 17. 57 million in 2003. The <b>gross</b> <b>enrolment</b> <b>rate</b> in Chinese higher education increased from 9 % in 1997 to 17 % in 2004. Chinese higher education changed during this transition process from an elite to a mass system. During the expansion many problems emerged. These problems are related directly or indirectly to the issue of financing. Giving that China is still a developing country, how to resolve the financing problem is the key to the success of the transition from an elite to a mass system. Using a literature study and a qualitative inquiry, the research examined the general theories in the financing of higher education, the relevant experiences in the United States, Britain and India and the recent development of higher education financing in China. The study reveals that to ease the financial constraints, it is important to develop non-traditional institutions to lower higher education costs. China established a diversified adult higher education system that expanded at about the same rate as its regular institutions. The study also found that few governments can afford a mass system. Therefore, it is necessary to seek non-governmental funds by strategies such as introducing tuition fees and developing private institutions. However, the fee policy should be paralleled by the student assistance policies so as to reduce the inequality in higher education provision. It is believed that theoretical knowledge gained from the research could contribute to the integration of the theories on the financing of higher education within the context of massification thereof.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} {{on the first of}} the six Education for All (EFA) goal as {{conceived}} in Dakar, which calls upon countries to expand and improve comprehensive Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children. Strong early childhood foundations — including good health, nutrition and a nurturing environment — can help ensure a smooth transition to primary school, a better chance of completing basic education, and a route out of poverty and disadvantage. The objective of the study is therefore, to assess the status of ECCE in Ethiopia at this last year of the EFA goals and learn experiences from other countries to incorporate in the post EFA goals. This review utilizes document analysis techniques from different sources. The study’s findings indicated that the enrolment of pre-primary education is increasing every year though underreporting remains a persistent issue in the kindergarten centers. Preprimary enrolment has increased dramatically starting from the year 2004 E. C. (2011 / 12) and this is because ‘O ’ class and child to child enrolments have been counted as part of pre-primary. In 2005 E. C. (2012 / 13) out of the estimated 7. 71 million children of the appropriate age group (age 4 to 6) about 2. 01 million children have been reported to have access to pre-primary education all over the country. Though the enrolment is small when compared to the appropriate age group, <b>gross</b> <b>enrolment</b> <b>rate</b> is higher than the previous year. This increase is due to the improved reporting of “O ” class and child to child data in the year 2005 E. C. (2012 / 13) from primary schools. Finally, it is recommended among others that; there should be high-level political support, a consultative process to develop a national ECCE policy for children from birth to age 8, stronger and more partnerships between government and the private sector, and upgrading of ECCE staff, particularly through flexible recruitment strategies...|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{understand}} why some children in rural Yemen stop their basic schooling while others do not. Basic schooling is defined as nine grades of compulsory schooling in Yemen. All {{of the children in}} the study had access to basic resources such as nearby schools, female teachers and piped water in their communities – all reasons identified in the literature as potential barriers to basic school completion. Despite improvements over the last two decades, Yemen continues to show some of the worst education statistics in the region. The international education development community has long identified Yemen as a focus country for education aid, which started in earnest in the early 1990 s. Having only initiated its mass schooling system in the late 1960 s and having only a handful of schools to start with, the initial focus of education development was on access. Enrolment increased dramatically in the system’s early decades, but school completion lagged behind and the gender gap remained wide. In the 2006 / 07 school year, <b>gross</b> <b>enrolment</b> <b>rates</b> in basic schooling were 64 per cent for girls and 74 per cent for boys.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the measurement}} issues in education achievement, {{and integration of}} education goals and targets, {{in the context of}} human development in India. Measurement issues are distinguished by (a) choice of indicators and variables and (b) data used in estimation/projection/computation of indicators and variables in the global human development reports (HDRs) and in India’s national and sub-national HDRs. This analysis establishes the non-comparability of measurement of the education achievement by indicators and variables, and shows a case for integration of education goals and targets between global, national and sub-national levels. Policy implications and imperatives from these analyses of the Indian experiences offer lessons for measurement of education achievement in developing countries.
