This enables {{it to be a}} privileged technique as a first-line method of choice for the assessment of tumour. The magnetic field strength of scanners for human is in the range of Ultra High Frequency (UHF). It provides the structural imaging with higher spatial resolution and functional (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) contrast (Olman et al. 2012). Also, the columnar level of resolution increases the contrast of the image. The functional imaging by MRI includes Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), MRSand Perfusion Weighted Imaging (PWI). Thus, providing high end accuracy of estimation in tumour grading (Fink et al. 2015; Holdsworth and Bammer 2008). However, the sensitivity and specificity of the functional information provided by MRI is minimal compared to that of PET. In other way around, MRI technique sounds meritorious over CT as it is devoid of <b>harmful</b> <b>radiations.</b> The additional advantage of MRI is that it offers motion correction in reconstruction of the anatomical information (Atkinson 2011).|$|E
40|$|Microwave {{absorbing}} {{materials have}} received great attention {{in recent years}} for both civil and military fields due to various applications in communications, radar, satellite systems, and anechoic chambers. Wireless communication is currently the fastest growth of telecommunication technology. Many {{studies have indicated that}} there are <b>harmful</b> <b>radiations</b> produced by transmitting telecommunications structures. Effects on human exposure include dizziness, nausea, vomiting and loss of breath. A way to reduce strong microwave radiations for human is by applying a microwave absorbing paint coating to the wall of the built spaces. The green painting mixed with ingredients from coconut shells is the main material that is analyzed in this research. The findings show that material applied with the green painting can readily absorb the microwave radiations. The wave-absorbing materials are designed by using Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Microwave Studio simulation software. The goal of this simulation is to find the best performing absorber. From dielectric constant value, the modeling and simulation stage of microwave absorber are executed to obtain the reflectivity or S 11 result using CST Microwave Studio software. Analysis of the S 11 results and measurement of absorber performance are evaluated to define the microwave absorber performance. A free space measurement setup operating in the frequency of Ku Band is employed to measure absorption. The results show that the green painting with coconut based carbon can be used as coating absorbing material. Each material applied with the green painting shows excellent absorption at 3 to 6 dB range. The most excellent result is shown by double layer coating absorption up to 17 dB...|$|E

40|$|Colour {{therapy is}} a popular ancient healing art that makes use of colour {{vibrational}} energies to balance and harmonise the body’s subtle energies and physical organs {{in order to create}} a state of holistic well-being and good health. Vibrational medicine uses Einsteinian and Quantum Physics theories, which considers the human body to be a dynamic energy system. Vibrational medicines are thought to work through the body’s ability to absorb and emit energies through the skin and affecting the resonation of its cells and organs. Suppressed negative energy is thought to eventually transpire as an emotional dysfunction which in turn further transpires into a physical disorder (dis-ease). Negative energies are considered to be toxic in nature and akin to other <b>harmful</b> <b>radiations</b> such as those emitted from electrical appliances. These invisible electromagnetic frequencies are the subject of epidemiological studies and include imbalances or blockages to the human energy system caused by the affects of nutritional and chemical changes and electromagnetic tensions from the environment (Gerber, R, 2000). Energies that work in harmony with the body are considered to be positive, whereas negative energies and excesses of energy frequencies create imbalances in the human energy system resulting in illness. Negative energies therefore need to be released and the energy system replenished with positive energies. Given that frequencies of colour are thought to have the potential to rebalance the energy system, by introducing energies that the system is lacking or by dissipating excess energies; and that coloured fabrics act as colour filters, then it is possible that the colours we wear affect our health. This paper considers the theories of colour as a vibrational energy and its potential to affect our physical and emotional health through the proximity of the colours we wear...|$|E

It was noticed in mid 80 s that ozone layer has thinned on the poles of the planet due to release of man-made substances commonly known as Ozone Depleting Substances, (ODS) into its atmosphere. The consequences of this change are adverse as the <b>harmful</b> <b>radiations</b> reach {{to the surface of}} the earth, strongly influencing the crops yield and vegetation. These radiations are major cause of skin cancer that has long exposure to Ultra Violet (UV) radiation. United States environmental protection agency and European community have imposed strict regulations to curb the emission of ODS and phase out schedules for the manufacture and use of ODS that was specified by Montreal protocol in 1987. Problem statement: This research deled with data analysis of ozone layer thickness obtained from Abu-Dhabi station and detailed measurement of air pollution levels in Kuwait. Approach: The ozone layer thickness in stratosphere had been correlated with the measured pollution levels in the State of Kuwait. The influence of import of ozone depletion substances for the last decade had been evaluated. Other factor that strongly affects the ozone layer thickness in stratosphere is local pollution levels of primary pollutants such as total hydrocarbon compounds and nitrogen oxides. Results: The dependency of ozone layer thickness on ambient pollutant levels presented in detail reflecting negative relation of both non-methane hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide concentrations in ambient air. Conclusion: Ozone layer thickness in stratosphere had been measured for five years (1999 - 2004) reflecting minimum thickness in the month of December and maximum in the month of June.

40|$|M. Sc. Radionuclides {{exist in}} the {{environment}} because of natural and human activities that are {{an essential part of}} our lives. Nuclear processing, medicinal applications (using isotopes) and electric power production by nuclear stations are few examples of human activities that result in production of radioactive waste (RAW). The nuclear power stations in our world have to store their waste in such a manner that the present and future generations are protected from <b>harmful</b> <b>radiations</b> and this is a challenge. Exposure to RAW can result in severe, diverse and irreversible consequences such as damage of the ecosystem, pollution, cancers, birth mutations, to mention just a few. Solvent extraction (SE) technique is currently used to purify large volumes of secondary liquid waste before they are released to the environment or stored. However, even after the SE purification, highly radioactive liquid waste is given off. This highly radioactive liquid waste is solidified in a glass matrix (vitrification). In an attempt to reduce the disposal of large volumes of secondary RAW generated during the purification technology, this study was initiated to investigate the possibility of using multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as part of the SE technique. As the main nuclear liquid extraction processes involve tributyl phosphate (TBP), the MWCNTs were linked to TBP, polymerised to give a MWCNTs-TBP polymer that was tested in the nuclear environment. This polymer should possess good chelating properties due to the inclusion of the phosphate and should be a good absorbent as MWCNTs are promising absorbent carbon materials. To test the hypothesis of the study MWCNTs-TBP polymer was tested for uranium extraction. The MWCNTs-TBP polymer gave a zero Kd value which indicates that the adsorption capacity of the polymer to remove radionuclides from waste streams was not successful. The MWCNTs were then tested for iodine- 131 extraction whereby they were compared with single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and double walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs). In this test SWCNTs gave a Kd value of 81694 mL/g which proved that they can be used in nuclear waste applications...|$|E

40|$|Using dynamic {{energy budget}} (DEB) theory, this paper explores the {{potential}} of excess and <b>harmful</b> <b>radiation,</b> notably UV, to cause changes in performance and, ultimately, bleaching in scleractinian corals {{for a range of}} ambient nitrogen and (beneficial) photosynthetically active radiation levels. Two negative impacts of radiation are considered: a reduction in the capacity of the symbiont to generate energy through photosynthesis (defined in this paper as photoinhibition); an increase in the costs for the symbiont to remain viable due to repair of damage (defined in this paper as photodamage). Model predictions indicate that although both types of impact reduce the growth potential of host and symbiont, photoinhibition predominantly affects host features, except at very low ambient nitrogen levels, under which conditions the severity of nitrogen limitation is so strong that a reduction in photosynthetic rates due to photoinhibition has minimal impact. In steady state, photoinhibition leads to a reduction in host biomass, and an increase in symbiont density, implying that photoinhibition (as defined in this paper) is unlikely to cause bleaching. In contrast, the impact of photodamage is mostly affecting symbiont features, including a decline in symbiont density. Thus, photodamage may contribute to coral bleaching. Furthermore, the model predicts that, with both photoinhibition and photodamage, an increasing ratio of <b>harmful</b> to beneficial <b>radiation</b> accelerates the suppression of growth rates of symbiont and host, implying that coral health deteriorates progressively faster with increasing <b>harmful</b> <b>radiation,</b> such as UVb.
