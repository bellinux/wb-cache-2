5|$|The {{area was}} poised to become a state park in 1903, but a veto by Governor Richard Yates {{prevented}} that from occurring. Supporters continued to press for the White Pines Woods, as it was once known, to receive state park designation throughout the period 1903-1927. In 1927 the park was established with help from supporters in the Chicago media. The park contains two freshwater streams, <b>dolomite</b> <b>rock</b> formations, {{and a variety of}} activities generally associated with Illinois state parks. Along Pine Creek, one of the park's two streams, fords were constructed instead of bridges allowing visitors to drive through the creek.|$|E
25|$|The team {{researching the}} Gorham's Cave {{scratches}} {{sought to determine}} whether it might have been produced accidentally, for example as a by-product of using the rock as a surface for cutting meat or fur. They carried out experiments with tools similar to those that would have been available at the time to carve grooves into blocks of similar <b>dolomite</b> <b>rock,</b> to identify how the scratches might have been made. They decided that the lines were most likely created by using a pointed tool or cutting edge to scrape repeatedly along, and deepen, an existing groove, taking as many as 300 strokes and requiring at least an hour's work. In addition, the scratches are in what would have been a very visible location and would have been immediately noticeable to anyone entering the cave.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2012, archaeologists {{discovered}} an engraving in Gorham's Cave, buried under 39,000-year-old sediments, {{which has been}} called [...] "the oldest known example of abstract art". Consisting {{of a series of}} intersecting lines, the engraving is located about [...] inside the cave on a ledge that is thought to have been used by Neanderthals as a sleeping place. Its meaning (or whether it had any meaning) is not known but researchers have described it as providing the first evidence that Neanderthals had the cognitive ability to produce abstract act. The engraving was clearly made deliberately, rather than being an accidental by-product of another process such as cutting meat or fur, and would have taken a significant amount of effort to carve into the <b>dolomite</b> <b>rock</b> of the cave.|$|E
2500|$|The region lies on {{sedimentary}} rock layers deposited {{on the floor}} of a shallow sea 500 million years ago. [...] The lower, older layer is sandstone overlain by more recent <b>dolomite</b> <b>rock.</b> [...] Much later a deep channel was carved into this stone by the ancient Mississippi River, which 10,000 years ago was greatly swollen from the melting glaciers to the north. [...] The softer sandstone was eroded more easily, undercutting the dolomite on both banks of the river. [...] The dolomite fractured off along vertical joints, leaving sheer rock faces still visible today. [...] Side streams flowing into the Mississippi cut gullies into the river banks, creating a series of bluffs capped with erosion-resistant dolomite. [...] Located in the Driftless Region of , the area was missed by the most recent Wisconsonian glaciation, and therefore is a region of deep river valleys dissecting the upland plains.|$|E

SPO statistics applied on four images from ferroan <b>dolomite</b> host <b>rock</b> give a well defined orientation of ribbons related to the intermediate axis of magnetic susceptibility K 2. For AMS data, two magnetic fabrics are observed. The first one is observed in ferroan <b>dolomite</b> host <b>rock</b> and characterised by a prolate ellipsoid of magnetic susceptibility with a vertical magnetic lineation. The magnetic susceptibility carrier is Fe-rich dolomite. These features are probably acquired during metasomatic fluid circulations. In Fe-rich <b>dolomite</b> host <b>rock,</b> ‹c› axes are vertical. As a rule, (0001) planes (i. e. planes perpendicular to ‹c› axes) are isotropic with respect to crystallographic properties. So, the magnetic anisotropy measured in this plane should reflect crystallographic modification due to fluid circulation. This is confirmed by the texture observed using the SEM. Consequently, AMS results show a dominant NE-SW elongation interpreted as the global circulation direction and a NW-SE secondary elongation that we have considered as sinuosities of the fluid trajectory. The second type of magnetic fabric is essentially observed in the limestone and characterised by an oblate form of the ellipsoid of magnetic susceptibility, a horizontal magnetic foliation and mixed magnetic susceptibility carriers. It is interpreted as a sedimentary fabric...|$|R
50|$|Both {{calcium and}} {{magnesium}} go into solution when <b>dolomite</b> <b>rock</b> is dissolved. The speleothem precipitation sequence is: calcite, Mg-calcite, aragonite, huntite and hydromagnesite. Hence, {{the most common}} speleothem (secondary deposit) in caves within <b>dolomite</b> <b>rock</b> karst, is calcium carbonate in the most stable polymorph form of calcite. Speleothem types known to have a dolomite constituent include: coatings, crusts, moonmilk, flowstone, coralloids, powder, spar and rafts. Although {{there are reports of}} dolomite speleothems known to exist in a number of cave around the world, they are usually in relatively small quantities and form in very fine-grained deposits.|$|E

30|$|The copper {{ore deposit}} {{exploited}} by KGHM Polish Copper Ltd. {{is located in}} Fore-Sudetic Monocline within the LGOM of south-western part of Poland. Copper ore extraction in Poland is concentrated in three underground mines: Lubin, Rudna and Polkowice-Sieroszowice. The depth of deposits in LGOM ranges from 600  m in Lubin mine, to more than 1100  m in Rudna mine. Copper minerals are hosted by three main lithological Zechstein rock types: sandstone, shale and <b>dolomite.</b> Generally, the <b>rock</b> mass {{in the area of}} copper mines in LGOM is characterized by a layered structure. In a majority of the area, the thick dolomite layer occurs directly above the excavations roof. The <b>dolomite</b> <b>rocks</b> are characterized by a relatively high strength and small deformability. In the floor instead the weaker sandstone rocks are deposited. The copper ore exploitation is conducted by the room-and-pillar mining system with adopting the technique using the phenomenon of natural roof settlement. The principle of this solution is to eliminate the extracted voids by the deflection of the roof and prop it on the residual technological pillars as well as by self-acting roof fall (Butra et al. 1996).|$|R
