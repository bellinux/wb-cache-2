As a rule these mesoionic compounds undergo two competing reactions: i) photolytic cleavage via a triplet state, leading to the corresponding pyridines and to carbenes, nitrenes and oxene respectively; ii) photochemical rearrangement via an excitet singlet state, leading either to ring contraction, to <b>ring</b> <b>enlargement</b> or to <b>ring</b> cleavage. The photocheinistry of N-iminopyridinium ylides has been studied in detail, sinceihe photoinduced rearrangement pattern leads in high yield to the isomeric l, 2 —diazepines. Overall quantum yield of this <b>ring</b> <b>enlargement</b> process is low. In order to interpret the uv spectra of these l-iminopyridiniuni ylides, their dichroism has been measured using EggerTs stretched film technique.
