5|$|Dugdale's book is {{also the}} source {{for many of the}} {{surviving}} <b>engravings</b> of the building, created by Bohemian etcher Wenceslaus Hollar. In July 2010, an original sketch for Hollar's <b>engravings</b> was rediscovered when it was submitted to Sotheby's auction house.|$|E
5|$|The carvings are {{all based}} on popular series of <b>engravings,</b> which were often {{published}} in pattern books. Nuremberg was the origin of numerous such books, and one may {{have been brought to}} Edzell by the miner Hans Ziegler. Specifically, the images of the deities are derived from <b>engravings</b> of 1528–29 by the German artist Georg Pencz (or Iorg Bentz, c. 1500–1550), a pupil of Albrecht Dürer; the initials I. B. appear on the carving of Mars. The arts and virtues are both based on <b>engravings</b> derived from paintings by the Flemish artist Marten de Vos. The <b>engravings,</b> by Jan Sadeler and Crispijn de Passe, were widely distributed in Scotland, along with those of the deities. Indeed, the image of Prudence is identical to that used by the King's Master of Works William Schaw, in the spectacular display to welcome Queen Anne to Scotland, following her marriage to James VI in 1589.|$|E
5|$|The name Twyfelfontein {{refers to}} the spring itself, to the valley {{containing}} the spring, and {{in the context of}} traveling and tourism also to a greater area containing nearby tourist attractions: the rock <b>engravings,</b> the Organ Pipes (Namibia), Burnt Mountain, Doros crater, and the Petrified Forest. The World Heritage Site covers the area of rock <b>engravings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{the site}} {{contains}} rock paintings at 13 different locations, with depictions of humans painted in red ochre in six rock shelters. The similar occurrence of rock paintings and rock <b>engravings</b> is very rare.|$|E
5|$|All {{the other}} <b>engravings</b> are of {{completed}} dishes, showing the serving-plate {{with the food}} arranged on it and often elaborately garnished. The artists and engravers of the food illustrations are not identified.|$|E
5|$|Howard's paintings, drawings, wood <b>engravings</b> {{and book}} designs {{can be viewed}} on the website Barbara Howard's Unfolding Visual World.|$|E
5|$|The Four Stages of Cruelty is {{a series}} of four printed <b>engravings</b> {{published}} by English artist William Hogarth in 1751. Each print depicts a different stage {{in the life of the}} fictional Tom Nero.|$|E
5|$|The fourth edition was {{revised and}} {{extended}} by the ornithologists Alfred Newton and Howard Saunders, with some additional illustrations {{bringing the total}} number of <b>engravings</b> up to 564.|$|E
5|$|The images {{described}} by Las Casas were later depicted by Theodore de Bry in copper plate <b>engravings</b> that helped expand the Black Legend against Spain.|$|E
5|$|The {{work was}} {{illustrated}} with <b>engravings,</b> based on Wallace's observations and collection, by the leading illustrators Thomas Baines, Walter Hood Fitch, John Gerrard Keulemans, E. W. Robinson, Joseph Wolf and T. W. Wood.|$|E
5|$|Twyfelfontein valley {{has been}} {{inhabited}} by Stone-age hunter-gatherers of the Wilton stone age culture group since approximately 6,000 years ago. They made {{most of the}} <b>engravings</b> and probably all the paintings. 2,000 to 2,500 years ago the Khoikhoi, an ethnic group related to the San (Bushmen), occupied the valley, then known under its Damara/Nama name ǀUi-ǁAis (jumping waterhole). The Khoikhoi also produced rock art which can clearly be distinguished from the older <b>engravings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Works {{from her}} {{collection}} {{were given to}} Wheaton College in 1922 during her 50th-year reunion, including an oil sketch by Alix d'Anethan and a seascape by Alfred Stevens. She loaned her paintings to the Worcester Art Museum, and the Fitchburg Public Library was a beneficiary of photographs, prints, <b>engravings,</b> textiles, dishes, and furniture. She {{was involved in the}} placement of art at the library so that visitors to every department would have the opportunity to view the works of art, including European prints and rare <b>engravings</b> that span several centuries.|$|E
5|$|As the 18th century dawned, Sicilian architects were {{employed}} to create the new palazzi and churches. These architects, often local, were able to design in a more sophisticated style {{than those of the}} late 17th century; many had been trained in mainland Italy and had returned with a more detailed understanding of the Baroque idiom. Their work inspired less-travelled Sicilian designers. Very importantly, these architects were also assisted by the books of <b>engravings</b> by Domenico de' Rossi, who for the first time wrote down text with his <b>engravings,</b> giving the precise dimensions and measurements of many of the principal Renaissance and Baroque façades in Rome. In this way, the Renaissance finally came late to Sicily by proxy.|$|E
5|$|Bewick is {{best known}} for his A History of British Birds, which is admired today mainly for its wood <b>engravings,</b> {{especially}} the small, sharply observed, and often humorous vignettes known as tail-pieces. The book was the forerunner of all modern field guides. He notably illustrated editions of Aesop's Fables throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|George Cruikshank, the {{illustrator}} who {{had previously}} worked with Dickens on Sketches by Boz (1836) and Oliver Twist (1838), {{introduced him to the}} caricaturist John Leech. By 24 October Dickens invited Leech to work on A Christmas Carol, and four hand-coloured etchings and four black-and-white wood <b>engravings</b> by the artist accompanied the text.|$|E
5|$|James Townsend was {{a leading}} citizen of the day. He served as a magistrate, was Member of Parliament for West Looe, and in 1772 became Lord Mayor of London, while Henrietta was a {{prominent}} artist, many of whose <b>engravings</b> of 18th-century Tottenham survive in the Bruce Castle Museum.|$|E
5|$|Mirror icons or kyōzō (鏡像) are {{drawings}} on {{the surface}} of a mirror. They first appeared around the mid-Heian period and are a representation of honji suijaku, fusing Buddhist deities with local Shinto kami. Three early mirror icons with line <b>engravings</b> of various deities have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E
5|$|Sallekhana is a vow {{available}} to both for Jain ascetics and householders. Historic evidence such as nishidhi <b>engravings</b> suggest sallekhana was observed by {{both men and}} women, including queens, in Jain history. However, in the modern era, death through sallekhana has been a relatively uncommon event.|$|E
5|$|The 28th edition is {{illustrated}} with 60, mostly small, <b>engravings.</b> There is a full-page frontispiece of the author, drawn by Auguste Hervieu and engraved by Samuel Freeman (1773–1857). Freeman {{is known for}} working mainly in stipple, and the portrait here is no exception.|$|E
5|$|The archaeological {{value of}} the site does not compare with its {{importance}} as rock art collection. The findings do, however, support the shamanist origin of the <b>engravings</b> because food remains from the site proved to be bones of small antelope, rock dassie and even lizards rather than the large species depicted.|$|E
5|$|The folio, which {{collected}} {{together the}} <b>engravings</b> from the paintings, {{has been the}} most lasting legacy of the Boydell enterprise: it was reissued throughout the 19th century and scholars have described it as a precursor to the modern coffee table book.|$|E
5|$|Three more portraits, less known {{are housed}} {{variously}} overseas. The {{first one is}} by West and is housed by the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. It was painted in 1783 and measures 59.21 x 41.43cm. Two more <b>engravings</b> after Gainsborough are scarce throughout the United States.|$|E
5|$|Twyfelfontein (Afrikaans: {{uncertain}} spring), officially {{known as}} ǀUi-ǁAis (Damara/Nama: jumping waterhole), is {{a site of}} ancient rock <b>engravings</b> in the Kunene Region of north-western Namibia. It consists of a spring in a valley flanked by the slopes of a sandstone table mountain that receives very little rainfall and has {{a wide range of}} diurnal temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Yarrell's tail-pieces, small <b>engravings</b> fitted into spaces at {{the ends}} of articles, follow the {{tradition}} established by Bewick, but differ in rarely being whimsical. Many are secondary illustrations showing details of bird anatomy or features useful in identification.|$|E
5|$|As {{printing}} became available, it {{was promptly}} used to publish herbals, the first printed matter being known as incunabula. In Europe, the first printed herbal with woodcut (xylograph) illustrations, the Puch der Natur of Konrad of Megenberg, appeared in 1475. Metal-engraved plates were first used in about 1580. As woodcuts and metal <b>engravings</b> could be reproduced indefinitely they were traded among printers: there was therefore a large {{increase in the}} number of illustrations together with an improvement in quality and detail but a tendency for repetition.|$|E
5|$|Asomtavruli is used intensively in iconography, murals, and {{exterior}} design, especially in stone <b>engravings.</b> Georgian linguist Akaki Shanidze made an attempt in the 1950s to introduce Asomtavruli into the Mkhedruli script as capital letters to begin sentences, {{as in the}} Latin script, {{but it did not}} catch on. Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri are officially used by the Georgian Orthodox Church alongside Mkhedruli. Patriarch Ilia II of Georgia called on people to use all three Georgian scripts.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{was also}} noted {{as having a}} strong moral sense and was an early campaigner for fair {{treatment}} of animals. He objected to the docking of horses' tails, the mistreatment of performing animals such as bears, and cruelty to dogs. Above all, he thought war utterly pointless. All these themes recur in his <b>engravings,</b> which echo Hogarth's attention to moral themes. For example, he shows wounded soldiers with wooden legs, back from the wars, and animals with a gallows in the background.|$|E
5|$|Boydell {{sought out}} the most eminent {{painters}} and engravers {{of the day to}} contribute paintings for the gallery, <b>engravings</b> for the folio, and illustrations for the edition. Artists included Richard Westall, Thomas Stothard, George Romney, Henry Fuseli, Benjamin West, Angelica Kauffman, Robert Smirke, James Durno, John Opie, Francesco Bartolozzi, Thomas Kirk, Henry Thomson, and Boydell's nephew and business partner, Josiah Boydell.|$|E
5|$|By May 1786, Raspe {{no longer}} had control over the book, which {{was taken over by}} a {{different}} publisher, G. Kearsley. Kearsley, intending the book for a higher-class audience than the original editions had been, commissioned extensive additions and revisions from other hands, including new stories, twelve new <b>engravings,</b> and much rewriting of Raspe's prose. This third edition was sold at two shillings, twice the price of the original, as Gulliver Revived, or the Singular Travels, Campaigns, Voyages, and Adventures of Baron Munikhouson, commonly pronounced Munchausen.|$|E
5|$|In {{paintings}} and <b>engravings</b> of the 18th and 19th centuries, Pugs usually appear with longer legs and noses than today, and sometimes with cropped ears. The modern Pug's appearance probably changed after 1860 {{when a new}} wave of Pugs were imported directly from China. These Pugs had shorter legs and the modern-style Pug nose. The British aristocrat Lady Brassey is credited with making black Pugs fashionable after she brought some back from China in 1886. Ear cropping was made illegal in 1895.|$|E
5|$|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau was a {{favourite}} {{architect of}} Catherine's. Like Bullant, {{he became a}} more fantastical designer with time. Nothing he built himself, however, has survived. He is known instead for his <b>engravings</b> of the leading architectural schemes of the day, including Saint-Maur, the Tuileries, and Chenonceau. In 1576 and 1579, he produced the two-volume Les Plus Excellents Bastiments de France, a beautiful publication dedicated to Catherine. His work is an invaluable record of buildings that were never finished or were later substantially altered.|$|E
5|$|On 17 November 1901, Illinois was {{presented}} with a silver service dining set provided {{by the state of}} Illinois and presented by Senator William E. Mason. It consisted of a large and small punch bowl, two candelabra, an ornamented fruit dish, a small fruit dish, two epicurean dishes, a large centerpiece and a ladle. Each item featured <b>engravings</b> of the crest of Illinois and an ear of corn. In 1943, the silver service was transferred to the Illinois Executive Mansion.|$|E
5|$|Sheppard's tale {{may have}} been an {{inspiration}} for William Hogarth's 1747 series of 12 <b>engravings,</b> Industry and Idleness, which shows the parallel descent of an apprentice, Tom Idle, into crime and eventually to the gallows, beside the rise of his fellow apprentice, Francis Goodchild, who marries his master's daughter and takes over his business, becoming wealthy as a result, eventually emulating Dick Whittington to become Lord Mayor of London.|$|E
5|$|Stackpole {{returned}} to San Francisco in 1912 and married Adele Barnes, two months younger than he, an art student of Xavier Martinez {{and one of}} the first graduates of the California Academy of Arts and Crafts. Adele Stackpole was a perfectionist in many ways, including the precision of her bookplate <b>engravings</b> and the demands she placed on her relationships. On June 15, 1913, the Stackpoles' son Peter was born in San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} human interaction with hippos comes from butchery cut marks on hippo bones at Bouri Formation dated around 160,000 years ago. Later rock paintings and <b>engravings</b> showing hippos being hunted {{have been found}} in the mountains of the central Sahara dated 4,000–5,000 years ago near Djanet in the Tassili n'Ajjer Mountains. The ancient Egyptians recognised the hippo as a ferocious denizen of the Nile and representations on the tombs of nobles show that the animals were hunted.|$|E
5|$|The school owns paintings, {{including}} {{a portrait of}} Tsar Nicholas I of Russia and another of the Jesuit Henry Garnet. In the Stuart Parlour are portraits of Jacobites including James Francis Edward Stuart, and his sons Charles Edward Stuart and Henry Benedict Stuart. There are also several original <b>engravings</b> by Rembrandt and Dürer, such as the 'Greater Passion' and the 'Car of Maximillian'.|$|E
