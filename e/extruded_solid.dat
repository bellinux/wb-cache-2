30|$|One of the {{manufacturing}} methods that can address many of the solubility problems of BCS class 2 and 4 drugs is the hot-melt extrusion (HME) technology (Maniruzzaman et al. 2012). HME disperses the active ingredient(s) as a matrix at the molecular level, thus forming solid solutions {{without the use of}} excessive heat or solvents while preserving drug potency. The HME approach has been successful in improving the delivery and human absorption of poorly water-soluble compounds. <b>Extruded</b> <b>solid</b> solutions (i.e. the end product of HME) offer greater thermodynamic stability compared to products prepared by alternative processes such as spray drying, solvent evaporation and other hot melt methods.|$|E

Twin – screw extrusion was optimized to develop various TLT/excipient/surfactant formulations followed by continuous capsule filling in the absence of any downstream equipment. Physicochemical characterisation showed the existence of TLT in partially crystalline state in the porous network of inorganic NEU for all extruded formulations. Furthermore, in-line NIR studies revealed a possible intermolecular H–bonding formation between the drug and the carrier resulting in the increase of TLT dissolution rates.

40|$|The {{objectives}} were to design an extrusion screw to produce biomass solid fuel {{in a cold}} extrusion process, and investigate the effects of molasses used as a selected adhesive on the physical properties of extruded products. The material employed consisted of crushed coconut shell char and coconut fiber char mixed {{at a ratio of}} 40 : 60. The ratios of molasses in the mixture were 10 : 100, 15 : 100 and 20 : 100 (by weight) and the extrusion die angles were 1. 0, 1. 1, 1. 2, and 1. 3 degrees gradation per experiment. The experimental results showed that the newly designed screw could function properly in the output range 0. 75 - 0. 90 kg/min, which is close to the design value. Regarding the molasses's effect on solid fuel properties, increasing the share of molasses was positive for both output and strength of the resulting briquettes, whereas the results of increasing die angle showed decreases in both output and strength.

50|$|The Triodetic System was {{developed}} and patented in Canada in 1955 by F. Fentiman and Sons of Ottawa. This system was originally made from aluminum components. It uses <b>extruded</b> cylindrical <b>solid</b> aluminum hubs (nodes) with slots, and tubular aluminum or steel members with matching crimped ends. Triodetic joints resist tension, compression and combined cross loading. Triodetic domes are designed as double curved shells which allow increased structural advantages for the span:rise ratio. The use of triangles makes the structure rigid and very strong, and similar to the geodesic design, stresses are transmitted throughout the structure. Even with light structural components, triodetic domes are able to withstand extremes of wind and even earth quakes.

40|$|During {{the early}} stages of the design process for complex, {{thin-walled}} aerospace structures such as gas turbine casings, finite element analysis (FEA) is carried out on idealised models comprised of simplified elements such as shells, plates or beams as opposed to solid elements. This computationally efficient analysis is used to determine the suitability of the component before a detailed analysis is attempted. However, the time saved by analysing an idealised model is significantly reduced when the time required to construct the idealisation is considered. Dimensional reduction is one such idealisation technique, involving the reduction of regions in a model within which the behaviour can be predicted. In modern CAD tools it is common practice for components to be generated by carrying out dimensional addition operations on planar sketches (e. g. sweeping a 2 D sketch along a line to create an <b>extruded</b> <b>solid,</b> or revolving a sketch to create an axisymmetric solid). Prototype software is detailed that uses the Medial Axis Transform (MAT) to quickly idealise the sketches used by the CAD tools. When the subsequent sweep or revolve operations are applied to the dimensionally reduced sketch, the resulting mixed dimensional geometry will be an idealised representation of the component, subdivided into slender and non-slender parts. Example analysis results provide stress plots of similar magnitude and distribution for both the solid, and mixed dimensional models, generated from the same sketch. The analysis time and computational resources requirement is reduced for the mixed dimensional models, and the time to dimensionally reduce the sketches is short. 1...|$|E
40|$|Hot melt {{extrusion}} has attracted recent interest from {{the pharmaceutical industry}} and academia as an innovative drug delivery technology. This novel technique {{has been shown to}} be a viable and robust method for preparing different drug delivery systems including pellets, implants, tablets, capsules and granules. The aim of this research was to understand hot {{melt extrusion}} processing and explore its pharmaceutical applications. Two applications of hot melt extrusion (HME) have been investigated to improve the properties of poorly soluble thermolabile drugs; polymeric solid dispersions and solid state polymorphic transformation. HME is a solvent free, continuous and readily scalable technique which is increasingly being considered as a viable alternative to conventionally used batch techniques. However, the high temperature and shear forces imparted by the extrusion process can limit its applications with heat sensitive active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Artemisinin was selected as a model drug which being thermolabile in nature and possesses processing challenges to processing HME. A low Tg amphiphillic copolymer, Soluplus® was selected as a matrix material. Drug-polymer compatibility was studied using rotational rheometry and thermal characterisation. The drug was found to be completely dissolved within the polymer, although some discolouration of the mixture was observed, indicating degradation of the API. The addition of a small percentage of citric acid to the formulation was found to prevent this degradation by increasing the pH. The dissolution profile of the formulation was approximately five times higher compared to that of the pure drug. The pharmacokinetic study was carried out using Albino rats to calculate bioavailability. The area under plasma concentration time curve (AUC 0 - 24 hr) and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) were four times higher for the prepared solid dispersion compared to that of pure artemisinin. <b>Extruded</b> <b>solid</b> dispersions were found to be amorphous in nature and maintained stability for 2 years. A second route to improving the solubility of poorly soluble APIs was also investigated. It was found that under carefully controlled conditions, high temperature extrusion (HTE) could be used to achieve polymorphic transformation with a number of APIs. This solvent-free continuous process was demonstrated with artemisinin, piracetam, carbamazepine and chlorpropamide. Artemisinin was used as a detailed case study of stability, solvent mediated transformation and mechanism of polymrophic transformation during extrusion, using computational modelling and model shear flows. At high temperature, phase transformation from orthorhombic to triclinic crystals was found to occur via the vapour phase. Under mechanical stress the crystalline structure was disrupted, leading to new surfaces being continuously formed and exposed to high temperatures; thus accelerating the transformation process. Polymorphic transformation during HTE was found to comprise three stages; i) preheating and conveying; ii) vapour phase transformation and size reduction and iii) continuous transformation and agglomeration. The triclinic form showed four times greater dissolution rate as compared to the orthorhombic form. The triclinic form showed two fold increase in bioavailability in Albino rats...|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} methods for forming {{internal}} cavities in extrusions. One {{way is to}} use a hollow billet and then use a fixed or floating mandrel.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Solid</b> <b>extruded</b> {{polymeric}} {{materials such as}} crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) are widely used in the electrical insulation of underground high voltage power transmission cables. However, the electric strength of the high voltage cable {{is affected by the}} presence of cavities (voids) in the insulating part. During service, when the insulation is subjected to electrical, mechanical and thermal stresses, these cavities may create a larger discontinuous region. As embedded gases and XLPE have different permittivities (respectly 1 and 2. 3), the potential distribution is not equally distributed and may exceed the breakdown voltage of the gas. On the other hand, under high voltage operating conditions, trapped or low mobility electrically charged species within the bulk can give rise to space charge build up. This paper treats the combined effect of space charge and cavities on the electric field, potential and temperature distribution within solid insulation. The values of their magnitudes in cavities are calculated, enabling us to envisage if partial discharges appear in these weak parts.

40|$|Creating virtual {{models of}} urban environments is {{essential}} to a disparate range of applications, from geographic information systems to video games. However, the large scale of these environments ensures that manual modeling is an expensive option. Procedural modeling is a automatic alternative that is able to create large cityscapes rapidly, by specifying algorithms that generate streets and buildings. Existing procedural modeling systems rely heavily on programming or scripting - skills which many potential users do not possess. We therefore introduce novel user interface and geometric approaches, particularly generalisations of the straight skeleton, to allow urban procedural modeling without programming. We develop the theory behind the types of degeneracy in the straight skeleton, and introduce a new geometric building block, the mixed weighted straight skeleton. In addition we introduce a simplifcation of the skeleton event, the generalised intersection event. We demonstrate that these skeletons {{can be applied to}} two urban procedural modeling systems that do not require the user to write programs. The first application of the skeleton is to the subdivision of city blocks into parcels. We demonstrate how the skeleton can be used to create highly realistic city block subdivisions. The results are shown to be realistic for several measures when compared against the ground truth over several large data sets. The second application of the skeleton is the generation of building's mass models. Inspired by architect's use of plan and elevation drawings, we introduce a system that takes a floor plan and set of elevations and <b>extrudes</b> a <b>solid</b> architectural model. We evaluate the interactive and procedural elements of the user interface separately, finding that the system is able to procedurally generate large urban landscapes robustly, as well as model a wide variety of detailed structures...|$|R
