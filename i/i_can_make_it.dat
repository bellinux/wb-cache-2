5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

The song include lines such as, [...] "Whatever it takes, I know <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> through/Be the best, the best I can be", to convey what Colero calls, [...] "a sense {{of joy and}} optimism." [...] Lisa Dalbello performed the lyrics with a children's choir over an 1980s pop music style tune {{during the first three}} seasons. Dave Ogilvie and Anthony Valcic of Canadian industrial-pop group Jakalope reworked and performed the song with a heavier sound, reflecting the growing maturity of the characters in season four. For seasons six and seven, the theme—still performed by Jakalope—was remixed and stripped of vocals. A fourth version of the theme song, with lyrics sung by Damhnait Doyle, was introduced for the eighth season, and a fifth version of the theme, performed by the in-show band [...] "" [...] is used for the ninth and tenth seasons. For seasons eleven and twelve, a sixth version of the theme song is used, performed by Alexz Johnson. Seasons thirteen and fourteen featured a truncated version of the Alexz Johnson theme.|$|E

2500|$|... "Don't Tell Me" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna, Mirwais Ahmadzaï, Joe Henry, with the former two also {{producing}} it. Ahmadzaï also provided programming, acoustic guitars and keyboards, while Michel Colombier arranged strings. It was composed using common time in the key of D major, with a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. Madonna's vocals range from the lower octave of G3 to the higher note of A4. Sonically, [...] "Don't Tell Me" [...] was considered [...] "a country meets dance" [...] track with trip hop beats infused with an acoustic [...] "folksy" [...] riff. During an interview for Interview Magazine, in March 2001, Madonna discussed the lyrics, stating, [...] "To me it is a romantic song. Just, you know, rip my skin off, do not tell me who I should love, or how I should love. Don’t tell me to give up. To me, in a way it’s like that Frank Sinatra song, 'If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> there, I’ll make it anywhere'." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1976, {{after having}} her public divorce from Jones the {{previous}} year, Wynette recorded, [...] "'Til <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Make</b> <b>It</b> on My Own". Often said by music critics {{to be about}} her break-up from Jones and moving on with her life, the song reached No.1 on the U.S. country singles charts, and No.84 on the pop singles charts, becoming her first single in three years to enter the pop charts. Often considered {{to be one of}} her signature songs, it more or less helped Wynette's career after her divorce, showing she could remain popular.

2500|$|The news {{shocked and}} split the magician {{community}} in Kerala. Before {{the commencement of}} the act, internationally acclaimed magician Samraj advised Mohanlal against performing the stunt. Samraj approached the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA) with a memorandum signed by 300 magicians, requesting it to urge Mohanlal {{to withdraw from the}} performance. AMMA president and actor Innocent, requested Mohanlal to withdraw from the stunt from endangering himself. He said [...] "Mohanlal is a pillar of the Malayalam film industry; he has no right to go and do such a risky show". The stunt was also to inspire the youth to overcome debacles in life with sheer determination. Briefing about the act in the press conference organised in Trivandrum, Mohanlal said [...] "The risk factor is fifty-fifty for the escape act. I hope that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> with the blessings of all". About the objective of the act, the Merlin Award winning magician Gopinath Muthukad said [...] "Counted {{as one of the most}} dangerous acts, the 'Burning Illusion' will find Mohanlal inspiring the youth to overcome debacles in life with sheer determination. He has been practising for a while to perfect it".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Rogers {{teamed up with}} close friend and Country Music legend Dottie West {{for a series of}} albums and duets.

Of West, Rogers stated in a 1995 TNN interview: [...] "She, more than anybody else I ever worked with, sang with such emotion that you actually believed what she sang. A lot of people sing words, Dottie West sang emotions." [...] In a 1978 press release for their album [...] "Every Time Two Fools Collide," [...] Rogers credited West with further establishing and cementing his career with Country Music audiences. In the same release, West credited him with taking her career to new audiences.

2500|$|On a September 2007 {{edition of}} The Radio Factor, while having a {{discussion}} about race with fellow Fox News commentator and author Juan Williams about a meal he shared with Al Sharpton, O'Reilly said [...] "You know when Sharpton and I walked in, it was like... big commotion and everything. But everybody was very nice. And I couldn't get {{over the fact that}} there was no difference between Sylvia's Restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City. I mean, it was exactly the same, even though it's run by blacks, primarily black patronship." [...] He commented that no one in Sylvia's [...] was [...] "screaming 'M'Fer, I want more iced tea.'" [...] He further added, [...] "I think that black Americans are starting to think more and more for themselves, getting away from the Sharptons and the Jacksons and people trying to lead them into a race-based culture. They're just trying to figure it out. 'Look, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>it.</b> If I work hard and get educated, I can make it.'" [...] The statement drew criticism from a number of places. Roland S. Martin of CNN said that the notion that black people are just now starting to value education is [...] "ridiculous" [...] and that the notion that black people let Sharpton or Jackson think for them is [...] "nuts". Media Matters for America covered the story on a number of occasions. O'Reilly responded, saying, [...] "It was an attempt to tell the radio audience that there is no difference—black, white, we're all Americans. The stereotypes they see on television are not true" [...] and also called out Media Matters, claiming that [...] "Media Matters distorted the entire conversation and implied I was racist for condemning racism." [...] Juan Williams said the criticism of O'Reilly was [...] "rank dishonesty" [...] and that the original comments [...] "had nothing to do with racist ranting by anybody except by these idiots at CNN." [...] Williams went on to say it was [...] "frustrating" [...] that the media try to criticize anyone who wanted to have an honest discussion about race.|$|E
