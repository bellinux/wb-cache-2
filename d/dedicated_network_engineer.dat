40|$|Abstractâ€”We {{describe}} the real-time monitoring {{infrastructure of the}} smart-grid pilot on the EPFL campus. We experimentally validate {{the concept of a}} real-time state-estimation for a 20 kV active distribution network. We designed and put into operation the whole infrastructure composed by the following main elements: (1) dedicated PMUs connected on the medium-voltage side of the network secondary substations by means of specific current/voltage transducers; (2) a <b>dedicated</b> communication <b>network</b> <b>engineered</b> to support stringent time limits and (3) an innovative state estimation process for real-time monitoring that incorporates phasor-data concentration and state estimation processes. Special care was taken to make the whole chain resilient to cyber-attacks, equipment failures and power outages. The achieved latency is within 65 ms. The refresh rate of the estimated state is 20 ms. The real-time visualization of the state estimator output is made publicly available, as well as the historical data (PMU measurements and estimated states). To the best of our knowledge, the work presented here is the first operational system that provides low-latency real-time state-estimation by using PMU measurements of a real active distribution network. Index Terms [...] Active distribution networks, communication network, phasor measurement units, real-time monitoring, state estimation, synchrophasors. I...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} years many {{technological}} advances were introduced in Internet television to meet user needs and expectations. However due to an overwhelming bandwidth requirements traditional IP-based television service based on simple client-server approach remains restricted to small group of clients. In such situation {{the use of the}} peer-to-peer overlay paradigm to deliver live television on the Internet is gaining increasing attention. Unfortunately the current Internet infrastructure provides only best effort services for this kind of applications and do not offer quality of service. This paper is a research proposition which presents potential solutions for efficient IPTV streaming over P 2 P networks. We assume that the solutions will not directly modify existing P 2 P IPTV protocols but rather will be <b>dedicated</b> for a <b>network</b> <b>engineer</b> or an Internet service provider which will be able to introduce and configure the proposed mechanisms in network routers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Network</b> <b>engineers</b> use {{different}} tools {{to manage and}} con-trol networks. While different tools use overlapping datasets, the data exchange between tools never had much priority. The creation of light-paths, <b>dedicated</b> <b>network</b> circuits, created the need for both multi-layer and multi-domain monitoring tools. Interdomain communication is still largely done by e-mail, but {{with the creation of}} multi-domain lightpaths, this is no longer feasible. Both standards and tools are required for the exchange of monitoring information between network domains. This ar-ticle gives an overview of the current standards and tools that are under development. The Dutch supercomputing centre SARA is developing and deploying tools based on the network description language (NDL) and the network markup language (NML). The RDF-based NDL {{has proven to be a}} useful basis for an information model, although many architec-tural details still need to ironed out before the end-to-end monitoring of lightpaths can be fully automated. ...|$|R

While the United States is still experiencing relatively high unemployment, demand for <b>network</b> <b>engineers</b> remains strong. To determine what skills employers are looking for, {{data was collected}} and analyzed from 1, 199 nationwide job advertisements listed on Dice. com. Requested skills were then grouped into related categories and summarized. The most frequently requested skills were identified and discussed. The authors also collected data regarding the education level and certifications requested.
