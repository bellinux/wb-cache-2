On {{the back of the}} skull, the paroccipital process is curved in side view. The teeth have paired wear facets. The first neck vertebra, the atlas, has a neural spine with processes pointing to the front and the inside, which are separate from the rear wing of the spine. This rear wing shows a continuous transverse width over most of its length. The neural arch of the atlas has on each side of its base a small triangular spur. The second neck vertebra, the axis, has a neural spine with a knob-shaped bump on {{the front end of the}} ridge on its front side. With the middle and rear neck vertebrae, the ridge between the rear joint processes, the postzygapophyses, does not extend beyond the rear edge of the neural arch.

40|$|Edge {{effects are}} a {{widespread}} and ubiquitous ecological phenomenon, yet they remain poorly studied across edges between restored and natural forests. To address {{this lack of}} knowledge, we studied vertebrate communities across edges between 3 -year old restored mine-pits and adjacent unmined forest in the jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest of south-western Australia. We found that mammal communities showed no edge response but reptile communities did. Overall reptile abundance and Morethia obscura abundance were higher in unmined forest along edges, Egernia napoleonis abundance was lower in unmined forest along edges, while Pogona minor abundance was lower in restored mine-pits along edges. Predictive models were unable to predict species edge responses, {{due to the lack}} of knowledge of the ecology of jarrah forest reptiles, but proved useful in identifying potential ecological mechanisms behind observed edge responses and suggested that potential mechanisms were likely different for each species. Our study is the first to show edge responses in both habitats <b>forming</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> between restored and natural forests, emphasizing the importance of studying both habitats <b>forming</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge.</b> Our results also suggest that, despite being poorly studied, edge responses are common across edges between restored and natural forest and result from a variety of ecological mechanisms. An increased understanding of the ecological mechanisms driving edge responses across edges between restored and natural forests will improve our ability to integrate restored areas into cross-landscape management and, ultimately, improve our ability to manage landscapes for biodiversity conservation...|$|E

40|$|Techniques of {{dimensional}} analysis {{have been applied}} to deuterium and hydrogen plasmas in DIII-D to test the postulate that the edge particle source {{plays a role in}} <b>forming</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> H-mode density profile. These experiments show that the pedestal density scale length is typically a factor of two to three larger in hydrogen plasmas than in deuterium plasmas with dimensionally similar ion parameters. These results are in agreement with the postulate [1, 2] that the density scale length is primarily determined by the local particle source, rather than by the shape of a hypothetical particle transport barrier. The electron temperature scale length displays a similar trend, albeit with a weaker density dependence. Thus the pedestal pressure gradient scale length is larger in hydrogen. It is also observed that the frequency of a coherent mode, localized within the pedestal, increases with the local density (i. e. inversely with the local density scale length) irrespective of the working gas species. This frequency is a factor of two lower in a hydrogen discharge than in a dimensionally similar deuterium plasma, a result which cannot be explained solely in terms of plasma physics variables...|$|E
40|$|The aquaporins {{transport}} water through membranes of numerous tissues, but the molecular mechanisms for sensing changes in extracellular osmolality and regulating water balance in brain are unknown. We have isolated a brain aquaporin by homology cloning. Like aquaporin 1 (AQP 1, {{also known as}} CHIP, channel-forming integral membrane protein of 28 kDa), the deduced polypeptide has six putative transmembrane domains but lacks cysteines at the known mercury-sensitive sites. Two initiation sites were identified encoding polypeptides of 301 and 323 amino acids; expression of each in Xenopus oocytes conferred a 20 -fold increase in osmotic water permeability not blocked by 1 mM HgCl 2, even after substitution of cysteine at the predicted mercury-sensitive site. Northern analysis and RNase protection demonstrated the mRNA to be abundant in mature rat brain but only weakly detectable in eye, kidney, intestine, and lung.

The observed field of view includes a prominent and twisted shell emission <b>forming</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of this SNR as well {{as part of the}} center-filled X-ray emission brightening toward the south-west edge of the field of view. The shell region spectra are in general represented by an optically thin thermal plasma emission in collisional ionization equilibrium with a temperature of ∼ 0. 3 keV and a density of ∼ 10 cm^- 3, which is much higher than the density obtained for inner parts. In contrast, we detected no significant X-ray flux from one of the TeV γ-ray peaks with an upper-limit flux of 2. 1 × 10 ^- 14 erg cm^- 2 s^- 1 in the 2 [...] 10 keV band. The large flux ratio of TeV to X-ray, larger than 16, and the spatial coincidence of the molecular cloud and the TeV γ-ray emission site indicate that the TeV γ-ray of W 28 is π^ 0 -decay emission originating from collisions between accelerated protons and molecular cloud protons.
