40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} an organization-based managerial intervention on performance of intensive care units (ICUs). Methods and Participants: Prospective multicentre cluster-randomized study with an intervention {{at the level of}} ICU staff was carried out. The intervention comprised a set of managerial changes, concerning the nurses' level of skill discretion and participation in decision-making introduced during a period of six months. The ICU-performance was monitored before, during and after the intervention, in terms of mortality and occurrence of out-of-range-measurements (ORMs). The ORMs were defined as a derangement of systolic blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) and urine output (Diur). Data were statistically analyzed by logistic regression with random effects due to ICUs. Results: The overall ICU and <b>hospital</b> <b>mortalities</b> were 14 % and 20 %, the incidence of BP, HR, O 2 and Diur ORM was respectively 46 %, 38 %, 28 % and 48 %. After adjusting for SAPSII, admission type and age the regression analyses revealed a positive effect of the intervention for all the six outcome variables. Conclusions: The intervention reduced both the ICU and <b>hospital</b> <b>mortalities</b> and the incidences of the out-of-range measurements. Registering ORMs provides a feasible method for evaluating ICU performance and could help to optimize individual patient care. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that prognostic models based on administrative data can provide valid adjusted mortality rates in specific patient populations. In {{this study we}} compared the performance and robustness of a model based on administrative data (customized <b>hospital</b> standardized <b>mortality</b> ratio) and a model based on clinical data (customized Simplified Acute Physiology Score II) in the Dutch intensive care unit population. Design: Cohort study of intensive care unit records from a national intensive care unit quality registry linked to administrative records from the Dutch National Medical Registration. The <b>hospital</b> standardized <b>mortality</b> ratio and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II models were first-level customized on {{the intensive care unit}} population. Setting: Fifty-five Dutch intensive care units. Patients: A total of 66, 564 intensive care unit patients admitted from 2005 to 2008. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Performance expressed by measures of discrimination, accuracy, and calibration (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, Brier score, Hosmer-Lemeshow C-statistic, and calibration plots). Additionally, the robustness of the models was assessed by simulating changes in the population's severity of illness and analyzing the effect on the intensive care units' standardized mortality ratios. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and Brier score of the customized Simplified Acute Physiology Score II were significantly superior to that of the customized <b>hospital</b> standardized <b>mortality</b> ratio (0. 85 and 0. 11 vs. 0. 77 and 0. 13, respectively). Calibration plots showed good agreement between observed and predicted mortality for low-risk patients in both models, with more discrepancy in the high-risk patients when using the customized <b>hospital</b> standardized <b>mortality</b> ratio. Severity of illness had influence on the intensive care units' standardized mortality ratios in both models, but the customized Simplified Acute Physiology Score II showed more robustness. Conclusions: The customized Simplified Acute Physiology Score II outperforms the customized <b>hospital</b> standardized <b>mortality</b> ratio in the Dutch intensive care unit population. Comparing institutions based on standardized mortality ratios can be unfavorable for those with a more severely ill intensive care unit population, especially when using the customized <b>hospital</b> standardized <b>mortality</b> ratio.
