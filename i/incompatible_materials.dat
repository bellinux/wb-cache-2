For obtaining high {{performance}} and low cost, a hybrid integrated transmitter is presented for {{plastic optical fiber}} (POF) communication including a 250 Mbps driver with temperature compensation of modulation current and a bonded 650 nm resonant cavity light emitting diode (RCLED) because of their <b>incompatible</b> <b>material.</b> The driver consists of an input buffer, a pre-drive amplifier, a main driver, a temperature compensation circuit to minimize the variation in extinction ratio, and a reference voltage circuit in 0. 5 μm BCD (Bipolar, CMOS, and DMOS) technology. The simulation results show that it can provide modulation current of 33 mA, - 3 dB bandwidth of 176. 4 MHz and the operating speed of 250 Mbps at 5 V. By using the temperature compensation circuit, the modulation current of the driver has increases from 33 mA at 15 C to 57 mA at 78 C. The 650 nm RCLED occupying an area of 200 μm × 200 μm is bonded to this provided driver with bonding pads.

40|$|Cumene {{hydroperoxide}} (CHP) {{is widely}} used in chemical processes, mainly as an initiator for the polymerization of acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene. It is a typical organic peroxide and an explosive substance. It is susceptible to thermal decomposition and is readily affected by contamination; moreover, it has high thermal sensitivity. The reactor tank, transit storage vessel, and pipeline used for manufacturing and transporting this substance are made of metal. Metal containers used in chemical processes can be damaged through aging, wear, erosion, and corrosion; furthermore, the containers might release metal ions. In a metal pipeline, CHP may cause incompatibility reactions because of catalyzed exothermic reactions. This paper discusses and elucidates the potential thermal hazard of a mixture of CHP and an <b>incompatible</b> <b>material’s</b> metal ions. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal activity monitor III (TAM III) were employed to preliminarily explore and narrate the thermal hazard at the constant temperature environment. The substance was diluted and analyzed by using a gas chromatography spectrometer (GC) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) {{to determine the effect}} of thermal cracking and metal ions of CHP. The thermokinetic parameter values obtained from the experiments are discussed; the results can be used for designing an inherently safer process. As a result, the paper finds that the most hazards are in the reaction of CHP with Fe 2 +. When the metal release is exothermic in advance, the system temperature increases, even leading to uncontrollable levels, and the process may slip out of control...|$|R
40|$|Hacking is now {{a widely}} {{discussed}} and known phenomenon, but remains difficult to define and empirically identify because {{it has come to}} refer to many different, sometimes <b>incompatible,</b> <b>material</b> practices. This paper proposes genealogy as a framework for understanding hacking by briefly revisiting Foucault’s concept of genealogy and interpreting its perspectival stance through the feminist materialist concept of the situated observer. Using genealogy as a theoretical frame a history of hacking will be proposed in four phases. The first phase is the ‘pre-history’ of hacking in which four core practices were developed. The second phase is the ‘golden age of cracking’ in which hacking becomes a self-conscious identity and community and is for many identified with breaking into computers, even while non-cracking practices such as free software mature. The third phase sees hacking divide into a number of new practices even while old practices continue, including the rise of serious cybercrime, hacktivism, the division of Open Source and Free Software and hacking as an ethic of business and work. The final phase sees broad consciousness of state-sponsored hacking, the re-rise of hardware hacking in maker labs and hack spaces and the diffusion of hacking into a broad ‘clever’ practice. In conclusion it will be argued that hacking consists across all the practices surveyed of an interrogation of the rationality of information techno-cultures enacted by each hacker practice situating itself within a particular techno-culture and then using that techno-culture to change itself, both in changing potential actions that can be taken and changing the nature of the techno-culture itself...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{manufacture}} nanomaterials with complex and structured composition using otherwise <b>incompatible</b> <b>materials</b> increasingly underpins {{the next generation}} of technologies. This is translating into growing efforts integrating a wider range of materials onto key technology platforms 1 - in photonics, one such platform is silica, a passive, low loss and robust medium crucial for efficient optical transport 2. Active functionalisation, either through added gain or nonlinearity, is mostly possible through the integration of active materials 3, 4. The high temperatures used in manufacturing of silica waveguides, unfortunately, make it impossible to presently integrate many organic and inorganic species critical to achieving this extended functionality. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of novel waveguides and devices made up of complex silica based materials using the self-assembly of nanoparticles.

40|$|Controlling the {{morphology}} of blends {{of materials}} {{is crucial for}} organic optoelectronic devices. However, the blends are often made of <b>incompatible</b> <b>materials,</b> resulting in an undesirable macrophase separation. This thesis focusses on {{the addition of a}} third component into the immiscible blend of small molecules to control their morphology. After introducing the concept of organic solar cells and the liquid crystalline state of matter, the available methods to control the morphology of blends in these two fields will be reviewed. Model compounds based on triphenylene derivatives was first studied. After preparing two incompatible triphenylenes based on the immiscibility of their pendent chains, the introduction of tailor-made compatibilisers was shown to have a tremendous effect on the morphology by suppressing the macrophase separation between the <b>incompatible</b> <b>materials</b> to a reproducible micro-segregation. Our research was then focussed on incompatible functional materials showing high promises for solar cell application: the hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene and the perylene diimide family. By applying the same concept as in the triphenylene derivatives, the incompatibility between hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene and perylene diimide was introduced by the immiscibility of their pendent chains.

40|$|Hemocompatibility {{of blood}} {{contacting}} medical devices {{has to be}} evaluated before their intended application. To assess hemocompatibility, blood flow models are often used and can either consist of in vivo animal models or in vitro blood flow models. Given the disadvantages of animal models, in vitro blood flow models are an attractive alternative. The in vitro blood flow models available nowadays mostly focus on generating continuous flow instead of generating a pulsatile flow with certain wall shear stress, which has shown to be more relevant in maintaining hemostasis. To address this issue, the authors introduce a blood flow model that is able to generate a pulsatile flow and wall shear stress resembling the physiological situation, which the authors have coined the "Haemobile. " The authors have validated the model by performing Doppler flow measurements to calculate velocity profiles and (wall) shear stress profiles. As an example, the authors evaluated the thrombogenicity of two drug eluting stents, one that {{was already on the}} market and one that was still under development. After identifying proper conditions resembling the wall shear stress in coronary arteries, the authors compared the stents with each other and often used reference materials. These experiments resulted in high contrast between hemocompatible and <b>incompatible</b> <b>materials,</b> showing the exceptional testing capabilities of the Haemobile. In conclusion, the authors have developed an in vitro blood flow model which is capable of mimicking physiological conditions of blood flow as close as possible. The model is convenient in use and is able to clearly discriminate between hemocompatible and <b>incompatible</b> <b>materials,</b> making it suitable for evaluating the hemocompatible properties of medical devices.

This testing reveals components with “hidden defects”, counterfeit parts and components with <b>incompatible</b> construction <b>materials</b> with {{both internal and external}} service conditions.
