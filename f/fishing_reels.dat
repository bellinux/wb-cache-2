2500|$|Two {{variations}} of the revolving spool bait casting reel are the conventional surf fishing reel and the big game reel. These are very large and robust <b>fishing</b> <b>reels,</b> designed and built for heavy saltwater species such as tuna, marlin, sailfish and sharks. [...] Surf <b>fishing</b> <b>reels</b> are normally mounted to long, two-handed rods; these reels frequently omit level-wind and braking mechanisms {{in order to achieve}} extremely long casting distances. [...] Big game reels are not designed for casting, but are instead used for trolling or fishing set baits and lures; they are ideal for fighting large and heavy fish off a pier or boat. [...] These reels normally use sophisticated star or lever drags in order to play out huge saltwater gamefish.|$|E
2500|$|The first English book {{on fishing}} is [...] "A Treatise of Fishing with an Angle" [...] in 1496. However, the book {{did not mention}} a reel.

2500|$|Most <b>fishing</b> <b>reels</b> are {{suspended}} {{from the bottom of}} the rod, since this position requires no wrist strength to overcome gravity while enabling the angler to cast and retrieve without changing hands. [...] The baitcasting reel's unusual mounting position atop the rod is an accident of history. [...] Baitcasting reels were originally designed to be cast when positioned atop the rod, then rotated upside-down in order to operate the crank handle while playing a fish or retrieving line. [...] However, in practice most anglers preferred to keep the reel atop the rod for both cast and retrieve by simply transferring the rod to the left hand for the retrieve, then reverse-winding the crank handle. [...] Because of this preference, mounting the crank handle on the right side of a bait casting reel (with standard clockwise crank handle rotation) has become customary, though models with left-hand retrieve have gained in popularity in recent years thanks to user familiarity with the spinning reel.|$|E
