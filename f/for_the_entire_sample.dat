The [NH 4 +]/[SO 42 -] equivalent ratio in fog water was larger than 1. 0 throughout the study period, indicat-ing that NH 3 gas was the primary neutralizing agent for fog water acidity.

A radial dimension allowance at said cylindrical surface at six points of the five sections was sized to assess the allowance value dispersion. The size of the sample measurements at the control points was n = 600. Statistic processing has shown normal law of distribution and sample homogeneity. To analyze the results of experiments was calculated a range of allowances for this workpiece. Calculated minimum and maximum allowance per one side for rough lathing were, respectively, 0. 905 mm and 1. 905 mm. It was found that 77 % points under control lie in calculated range of allowance values. And there are no points out of the range on lesser side that proves a lack of rejects; but there are points out of the range on the bigger side, that will require additional costs <b>for</b> machining <b>the</b> specified surface, including the cost of electricity. There were three power consumption calculations based on factory- recommended duty: <b>for</b> processing <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>sample</b> of forgings with an average allowance, for machining forgings allowances of which are within the recommended design range of allowance, and <b>for</b> processing <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>sample</b> of forgings with a minimum value of allowance.
