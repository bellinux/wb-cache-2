2500|$|The {{strategy}} that {{ultimately led to}} a successful proof of Fermat's Last Theorem arose from the [...] "astounding" [...] Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture, proposed around 1955—which many mathematicians believed would be near to impossible to prove, and was linked in the 1980s by Gerhard Frey, Jean-Pierre Serre and Ken Ribet to Fermat's equation. By accomplishing a partial proof of this conjecture in 1994, Andrew Wiles ultimately succeeded in proving Fermat's Last Theorem, as well as leading {{the way to a}} <b>full</b> <b>proof</b> by others of what is now the modularity theorem.|$|E

2500|$|Like CH, GCH is also {{independent}} of ZFC, but Sierpiński proved that ZF + GCH implies the {{axiom of choice}} (AC) (and therefore the negation of the axiom of determinacy, AD), so choice and GCH are not independent in ZF; there are no models of ZF in which GCH holds and AC fails. To prove this, Sierpiński showed GCH implies that every cardinality n is smaller than some Aleph number, and thus can be ordered. This is done by showing that n is smaller than [...] which is [...] smaller than its own Hartogs number — this uses the equality for the <b>full</b> <b>proof,</b> see Gillman (2002).|$|E
2500|$|Following this strategy, a {{proof of}} Fermat's Last Theorem {{required}} two steps. First, {{it was necessary}} to prove the modularity theorem – or at least to prove it for the types of elliptical curves that included Frey's equation (known as semistable elliptic curves). This was widely believed inaccessible to proof by contemporary mathematicians. Second, {{it was necessary to}} show that Frey's intuition was correct: that if an elliptic curve were constructed in this way, using a set of numbers that were a solution of Fermat's equation, the resulting elliptic curve could not be modular. Frey showed that this was plausible but did not go as far as giving a <b>full</b> <b>proof.</b> The missing piece (the so-called [...] "epsilon conjecture", now known as Ribet's theorem) was identified by Jean-Pierre Serre who also gave an almost-complete proof and the link suggested by Frey was finally proved in 1986 by Ken Ribet.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, Gerhard Frey {{noticed an}} {{apparent}} link {{between these two}} previously unrelated and unsolved problems. An outline suggesting this could be proved was given by Frey. The <b>full</b> <b>proof</b> that the two problems were closely linked, was accomplished in 1986 by Ken Ribet building on a partial proof by Jean-Pierre Serre who proved all but one part known as the [...] "epsilon conjecture" [...] (see: Ribet's Theorem and Frey curve). In plain English, these papers by Frey, Serre and Ribet showed that if the Modularity Theorem could be proven {{for at least the}} semi-stable class of elliptic curves, a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem would also follow automatically. The connection is described below: any solution that could contradict Fermat's Last Theorem could also be used to contradict the Modularity Theorem. So if the modularity theorem were found to be true, then by definition no solution contradicting Fermat's Last Theorem could exist, which would therefore have to be true as well.|$|E
