5|$|Red <b>foxes</b> may {{compete with}} striped hyenas on large carcasses. Red <b>foxes</b> may {{give way to}} hyenas on unopened carcasses, as the latter's {{stronger}} jaws can easily tear open flesh that is too tough for <b>foxes.</b> <b>Foxes</b> may harass hyenas, using their smaller size and greater speed to avoid the hyena's attacks. Sometimes, <b>foxes</b> seem to deliberately torment hyenas even {{when there is no}} food at stake. Some <b>foxes</b> may mistime their attacks, and are killed. Fox remains are often found in hyena dens, and hyenas may steal <b>foxes</b> from traps.|$|E
5|$|Southern grey desert <b>foxes</b> {{include the}} Asian {{subspecies}} V.v.griffithi, V.v.pusilla, and V.v.flavescens. These <b>foxes</b> display transitional features between northern red <b>foxes</b> and smaller fox species; their skulls possess more primitive, neotenous traits than the northern forms, {{and they are}} much smaller; the maximum sizes attained by southern <b>foxes</b> are invariably less than the average sizes of northern <b>foxes.</b> Their limbs are also longer, and their ears larger.|$|E
5|$|Among other {{inhabitants}} of London are 10,000 red <b>foxes,</b> {{so that there}} are now 16 <b>foxes</b> for every square mile (2.6 square kilometres) of London. These urban <b>foxes</b> are noticeably bolder than their country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards. <b>Foxes</b> have even sneaked into the Houses of Parliament, where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. Another broke into the grounds of Buckingham Palace, reportedly killing some of Queen ElizabethII's prized pink flamingos. Generally, however, <b>foxes</b> and city folk appear to get along. A survey in 2001 by the London-based Mammal Society found that 80 percent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around. This sample cannot be taken to represent Londoners as a whole.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 it was {{estimated}} that there were 10,000 <b>foxes</b> in London. City-dwelling <b>foxes</b> may have the potential to consistently grow larger than their rural counterparts, as a result of abundant scraps and a relative dearth of predators.

5|$|In Eurasia, red <b>foxes</b> may be preyed upon by leopards, caracals and Eurasian lynxes. The lynxes chase red <b>foxes</b> {{into deep}} snow, where their longer legs and larger paws {{give them an}} {{advantage}} over <b>foxes,</b> especially when {{the depth of the}} snow exceeds one metre. In the Velikoluki district in Russia, red <b>foxes</b> are absent or are seen only occasionally where lynxes establish permanent territories. Researchers consider lynxes to represent considerably less danger to red <b>foxes</b> than wolves do. North American felid predators of red <b>foxes</b> include cougars, Canadian lynxes and bobcats. Occasionally, large raptors such as Eurasian eagle owls will prey on young <b>foxes,</b> while golden eagles have been known to kill adults.|$|E

5|$|Red <b>foxes</b> are {{not readily}} prone to {{infestation}} with fleas. Species like Spilopsyllus cuniculi are probably only caught from the fox's prey species, while others like Archaeopsylla erinacei are caught whilst travelling. Fleas that feed on red <b>foxes</b> include Pulex irritans, Ctenocephalides canis and Paraceras melis. Ticks such as Ixodes ricinus and I.hexagonus {{are not uncommon}} in <b>foxes,</b> and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits still in their earths. The louse Trichodectes vulpis specifically targets <b>foxes,</b> but is found infrequently. The mite Sarcoptes scabiei {{is the most important}} cause of mange in red <b>foxes.</b> It causes extensive hair loss, starting {{from the base of the}} tail and hindfeet, then the rump before moving on to the rest of the body. In the final stages of the condition, <b>foxes</b> can lose most of their fur, 50% of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities. In the epizootic phase of the disease, it usually takes <b>foxes</b> four months to die after infection. Other endoparasites include Demodex folliculorum, Notoderes, Otodectes cynotis (which is frequently found in the ear canal), Linguatula serrata (which infects the nasal passages) and ringworms.|$|E

5|$|Red <b>foxes</b> are {{the most}} {{important}} rabies vector in Europe. In London, arthritis is not uncommon in <b>foxes,</b> being particularly frequent in the spine. <b>Foxes</b> may be infected with leptospirosis and tularemia, though they are not overly susceptible to the latter. They may also fall ill from listeriosis and spirochetosis, as well as acting as vectors in spreading erysipelas, brucellosis and tick-born encephalitis. A mysterious fatal disease near Lake Sartlan in the Novosibirsk Oblast was noted among local red <b>foxes,</b> but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of encephalomyelitis, which was first observed in captive bred silver <b>foxes.</b> Individual cases of <b>foxes</b> infected with Yersinia pestis are known.|$|E
5|$|Red <b>foxes</b> may kill small mustelids like weasels, stone martens, pine martens, stoats, kolonoks, polecats {{and young}} sables. Eurasian badgers may live {{alongside}} red <b>foxes</b> in isolated sections of large burrows. It {{is possible that}} the two species tolerate each other out of mutualism; <b>foxes</b> provide badgers with food scraps, while badgers maintain the shared burrow's cleanliness. However, cases are known of badgers driving vixens from their dens and destroying their litters without eating them. Wolverines may kill red <b>foxes,</b> often while the latter are sleeping or near carrion. <b>Foxes</b> in turn may kill unattended young wolverines.|$|E
5|$|Red <b>foxes</b> may prey on {{domestic}} rabbits and guinea pigs {{if they are}} kept in open runs or are allowed to range freely in gardens. This problem is usually averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban <b>foxes</b> frequently encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats usually have the upper hand. Authenticated cases of <b>foxes</b> killing cats usually involve kittens. Although most <b>foxes</b> do not prey on cats, some may do so, and may treat them more as competitors rather than food.|$|E

5|$|Urban <b>foxes</b> {{can cause}} {{problems}} for local residents. <b>Foxes</b> {{have been known}} to steal chickens, disrupt rubbish bins and damage gardens. Most complaints about urban <b>foxes</b> made to local authorities occur during the breeding season in late January/early February or from late April to August, when the new cubs are developing. In the UK, hunting <b>foxes</b> in urban areas is banned, and shooting them in an urban environment is not suitable. One alternative to hunting urban <b>foxes</b> has been to trap them, which appears to be a more viable method. However, killing <b>foxes</b> has little effect on the population in an urban area; those that are killed are very soon replaced, either by new cubs during the breeding season or by other <b>foxes</b> moving into the territory of those that were killed. A more effective method of fox control is to deter them from the specific areas they inhabit. Deterrents such as creosote, diesel oil, or ammonia can be used. Cleaning up and blocking access to den locations can also discourage a fox's return.|$|E
5|$|Wolves may {{kill and}} eat red <b>foxes</b> in {{disputes}} over carcasses. In areas in North America where red fox and coyote populations are sympatric, fox ranges {{tend to be}} located outside coyote territories. The principal cause of this separation {{is believed to be}} active avoidance of coyotes by the <b>foxes.</b> Interactions between the two species vary in nature, ranging from active antagonism to indifference. The majority of aggressive encounters are initiated by coyotes, and there are few reports of red <b>foxes</b> acting aggressively toward coyotes except when attacked or when their kits were approached. <b>Foxes</b> and coyotes have sometimes been seen feeding together. In Israel, red <b>foxes</b> share their habitat with golden jackals. Where their ranges meet, the two canids compete due to near identical diets. <b>Foxes</b> ignore jackal scents or tracks in their territories, and avoid close physical proximity with jackals themselves. In areas where jackals become very abundant, the population of <b>foxes</b> decreases significantly, apparently because of competitive exclusion.|$|E
5|$|A {{strain of}} truly domesticated red <b>foxes</b> was {{introduced}} by Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyayev who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph <b>foxes</b> on fur farms, selecting only those individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a population of <b>foxes</b> whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these <b>foxes</b> no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included piebald coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.|$|E
