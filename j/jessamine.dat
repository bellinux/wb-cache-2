60|$|We {{went into}} a sort of sitting room, and looked out through a window, {{latticed}} with little diamond panes, upon a garden wildly beautiful.

5|$|Six {{miles of}} prairie was a buffer zone between Houston and Bellaire. Originally {{the town was}} bounded by Palmetto, First, <b>Jessamine,</b> and Sixth (now Ferris) Streets.

Bellaire was incorporated as {{a city with a}} general charter in 1918, ten years after its founding. Bellaire had a population of 200 at the time. Because of the 1918 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate Bellaire's territory into its city limits, while Houston annexed surrounding areas that were unincorporated.|$|E
5|$|The ending varies {{depending}} upon the level of chaos the player has caused throughout the game. If Corvo saves Emily, she ascends the throne as Empress with Corvo at her side. If {{only a small amount}} of chaos has been caused, a golden age dawns and the plague is finally overcome. After many decades, Corvo dies of natural causes and Empress Emily Kaldwin I the Wise buries him beside Empress <b>Jessamine.</b> If much chaos is caused, the city remains in turmoil and is overrun with the plague. If Corvo fails to save Emily, Dunwall crumbles and Corvo flees the city by ship.|$|E

He began his tertiary studies at Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) in Lexington, Virginia. During his brief tenure there, he studied mathematics and belles-lettres and became friends with Hugh Lawson White.

He began his practice in Woodford County, but as central Kentucky was well already supplied with able lawyers, he moved to Logan County, Kentucky, on the then western frontier and opened his practice in Russellville.

I ran to her with open arms, and she received me with a sister's embraces. When we had seated ourselves beside the fountain, she began to upbraid me for leaving her so long alone.|$|R

60|$|Gillian {{asked her}} to show {{something}} designed by herself, and she produced an exquisite table-weight, bearing a spray of sweet peas. Gillian longed to secure it for her mother, {{but it was very}} expensive, owing to the uncommon stones used in giving the tints, and Mr. Stebbing evidently did not regard it with so much favour as the <b>jessamines</b> and snowdrops, which, being of commoner marbles, could be sold at a rate fitter for the popular purse. Several beautiful drawings in her office had been laid aside as impracticable, 'unless we had a carte blanche wedding order,' he said, with what Gillian thought a sneer.|$|R
