5|$|The Wagiman phonemic {{inventory}} {{is quite}} typical for a northern Australian language. It has six {{places of articulation}} with a stop and a nasal in each. There are also a number of laterals and approximants, a trill and a phonemic <b>glottal</b> stop (represented in the orthography by 'h'). Wagiman also has a vowel inventory that is standard for the north of Australia, with a system of 5 vowels.|$|E
5|$|Colonial orthography {{is marked}} {{by the use of}} c for /k/ (always hard, as in cic /kiik/), k for /q/ in Guatemala or for /k’/ in the Yucatán, h for /x/, and tz for /ts/; the absence of <b>glottal</b> stop or vowel length (apart {{sometimes}} for a double vowel letter for a long glottalized vowel, as in uuc /u’uk/), the use of u for /w/, as in uac /wak/, and the variable use of z, ç, s for /s/. The greatest difference from modern orthography, however, is in the various attempts to transcribe the ejective consonants.|$|E
5|$|British {{rhythm and}} blues {{differed}} in tone from that of African American artists, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. British {{rhythm and blues}} singers were criticised for their emulation of rhythm and blues vocal styles, with shouts, <b>glottal</b> stops, moans and cries. However, vocalists such as Van Morrison, Mick Jagger, Eric Burdon and Steve Winwood {{did not attempt to}} emulate a particular singer and were seen by critics as able to sing the blues convincingly and with some power. In cover versions of R songs, riffs were often simplified or used less frequently. The object of the music was usually to whip up energy, rather than to produce musical finesse. Many groups were based around guitars (rhythm, lead and bass) and drums and as a result arrangements tended to be guitar-oriented and at higher tempos than the originals. Amplification of guitars to the highest levels of underpowered amplifiers created the over-driven guitar sound that would become characteristic of rock music.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{introduced}} the Latin script, {{which was used}} to record {{a large body of}} Aztec prose, poetry and mundane documentation such as testaments, administrative documents, legal letters, etc. In a matter of decades pictorial writing was completely replaced with the Latin alphabet. No standardized Latin orthography has been developed for Nahuatl, and no general consensus has arisen for the representation of many sounds in Nahuatl that are lacking in Spanish, such as long vowels and the <b>glottal</b> stop. The orthography most accurately representing the phonemes of Nahuatl was developed in the 17th century by the Jesuit Horacio Carochi, building on the insights of another Jesuit, Antonio del Rincon. Carochi's orthography used two different diacritics: a macron to represent long vowels and a grave for the saltillo, and sometimes an acute accent for short vowels. This orthography did not achieve a wide following outside of the Jesuit community.|$|E
5|$|Pulmonic {{consonant}} {{letters are}} arranged singly or in pairs of voiceless (tenuis) and voiced sounds, with these then grouped in columns from front (labial) sounds {{on the left}} to back (<b>glottal)</b> sounds on the right. In official publications by the IPA, two columns are omitted to save space, with the letters listed among 'other symbols', and with the remaining consonants arranged in rows from full closure (occlusives: stops and nasals), to brief closure (vibrants: trills and taps), to partial closure (fricatives) and minimal closure (approximants), again with a row left out to save space. In the table below, a slightly different arrangement is made: All pulmonic consonants {{are included in the}} pulmonic-consonant table, and the vibrants and laterals are separated out so that the rows reflect the common lenition pathway of stop → fricative → approximant, as well as the fact that several letters pull double duty as both fricative and approximant; affricates may be created by joining stops and fricatives from adjacent cells. Shaded cells are judged to be implausible.|$|E
25|$|Final stops {{following}} open vowels merged as a <b>glottal</b> stop in Southern Min, Pu–Xian and Hainanese. In Eastern Min, only final *k {{changed to}} a <b>glottal</b> stop in this environment.|$|E
25|$|This <b>glottal</b> stop then {{disappeared}} in Pu–Xian.|$|E
25|$|There {{may have}} also been a <b>glottal</b> stop.|$|E
25|$|Ugaritic orthography {{indicated}} the vowel after the <b>glottal</b> stop.|$|E
25|$|Ejective consonants (plosives with {{simultaneous}} <b>glottal</b> stop) : , , etc.|$|E
25|$|A <b>glottal</b> stop or a glide may {{be added}} between vowels (epenthesis) to prevent hiatus.|$|E
25|$|Baxter also speculated on the {{possibility}} of a <b>glottal</b> stop occurring after oral stop finals.|$|E
25|$|The {{functions}} of the anterior and posterior differ between auxiliaries; with lexical verbs, they are non-past and past. The potential and veridical conditionals reflex the degree of certainty that something would have occurred. 1sg.npst -ˆta and a couple other forms lengthen the preceding vowel. The 1.ex forms apart from -ya begin with a <b>glottal</b> stop. The imp.sg is a <b>glottal</b> stop followed by an echo vowel.|$|E
25|$|A Hawaiian <b>glottal</b> stop thus {{represents}} the maximal phonetic reduction of other consonants in centuries past.|$|E
25|$|As in the {{neighboring}} Thai script, ◌ະ is used to represent a <b>glottal</b> stop after a vowel.|$|E
25|$|These <b>glottal</b> post-codas {{respectively}} conditioned {{rising and}} falling pitch contours, which became distinctive when the post-codas were lost.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{northern}} Chinese varieties, Sino-Vietnamese places level-tone {{words with}} sonorant and <b>glottal</b> stop initials {{in the upper}} level (ngang) category.|$|E
25|$|Warndarang has a {{consonant}} inventory {{similar to}} that of many Australian languages. There are five main places of articulation – bilabial, apico-alveolar, retroflex, lamino-alveolar, and velar – with a stop and a nasal in each, {{with the addition of a}} rarely used interdental stop. There are also two laterals, two rhotics, and two semi-vowels. The presence of a <b>glottal</b> stop is debatable; the <b>glottal</b> stops that Heath heard were unstable and appeared to be optional.|$|E
25|$|In Urdu script, hamza {{does not}} occur at the initial {{position}} over alif since alif is not used as a <b>glottal</b> stop in Urdu. In the middle position, if hamza is surrounded by vowels, it indicates a diphthong between the two vowels. In the middle position, if hamza is surrounded by only one vowel, it takes {{the sound of that}} vowel. In the final position hamza is silent or produces a <b>glottal</b> sound, as in Arabic.|$|E
25|$|In modern Hebrew, {{the letter}} {{represents}} a voiced <b>glottal</b> fricative , {{and may also}} be dropped, although this pronunciation is seen as substandard.|$|E
25|$|In the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), {{the sound}} of the <b>glottal</b> stop is {{represented}} by the letter ʔ, resembling a dotless question mark.|$|E
25|$|A <b>glottal</b> {{stop that}} {{occurs at the}} end of a word is often omitted when it is in the middle of a sentence.|$|E
25|$|They also {{adopted the}} {{proposal}} of Pan Wuyun to recast the laryngeal initials as uvular stops, though they retained a separate <b>glottal</b> stop.|$|E
25|$|Pulleyblank took Haudricourt's {{suggestion}} to its logical conclusion, proposing that the Chinese rising tone had also arisen from a final <b>glottal</b> stop.|$|E
25|$|A tilde {{indicates}} that the speaker should start mid, break off (with a <b>glottal</b> stop), then start again and rise like a question in tone.|$|E
25|$|In Philippine languages, the {{circumflex}} (pakupyâ) is used {{to represent}} the simultaneous occurrence of a stress and a <b>glottal</b> stop in the last vowel of the word.|$|E
25|$|The h {{initial and}} final {{are also used}} to {{represent}} the <b>glottal</b> stop in most communities, but in some, a superscript i {{is used as a}} glottal-stop letter.|$|E
25|$|In the Tongan language, the {{apostrophe}} {{is called}} a fakauʻa and is the last letter of the alphabet. It represents the <b>glottal</b> stop. Like the ʻokina, it is inverted.|$|E
25|$|In {{science fiction}} and fantasy, the {{apostrophe}} {{is often used}} in fictional names, sometimes to indicate a <b>glottal</b> stop (for example Mitth'raw'nuruodo in Star Wars), but also sometimes simply for decoration.|$|E
25|$|All the consonants {{except for}} the <b>glottal</b> stop ʔ shown in the consonants chart above can act as the onset of a syllable; however, the onset {{position}} is not obligatorily occupied.|$|E
25|$|The {{representation}} of the feature that distinguishes glottalized vowels (or <b>glottal</b> stop, as in some earlier analyses). Some earlier alphabets used h; more commonly today {{a special kind of}} apostrophe is used.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplification}} of {{the transcription}} of <b>glottal</b> stop that became transcribed as ء {{if it is}} in the end of the word and preceded by a long vowel and as ئ in other situations.|$|E
25|$|Tibetan {{folk music}} {{includes}} a cappella lu songs, which are distinctively high in pitch with <b>glottal</b> vibrations, {{as well as}} now rare epic bards who sing the tales of Gesar, Tibet's most popular hero.|$|E
25|$|Only two consonants {{can occur}} word finally in native vocabulary: the homorganic or placeless nasal, and the homorganic or <b>glottal</b> stop. These bear some {{similarities}} to the Japanese moraic n, ン and sokuon っ.|$|E
25|$|Mei Tsu-lin {{supported}} this theory with evidence from early transcriptions of Sanskrit words, {{and pointed out}} that rising tone words end in a <b>glottal</b> stop in some modern Chinese dialects, e.g. Wenzhounese and some Min dialects.|$|E
25|$|Tones are {{expressed}} by diacritics; checked syllables (i.e. those ending with <b>glottal</b> stops) {{are followed by}} the letter h. Where diacritics are not technically available, e.g. on {{some parts of the}} internet, tone alphabet may be used instead.|$|E
