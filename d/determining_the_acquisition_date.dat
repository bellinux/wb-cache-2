30|$|To quantitatively {{assess the}} effect of ΔT on the {{observed}} increase in crevasse area, we calculated the increase in crevasse area between consecutive images, ΔS, and examined its relation to ΔT. Table 2 lists the five examined SAR data pairs and their <b>acquisition</b> <b>dates.</b> In <b>the</b> case that <b>the</b> period between <b>acquisition</b> <b>dates</b> for a pair includes the minimum temperature for the year, the largest ΔT is chosen for the pair. For example, pair 3 (<b>acquisition</b> <b>dates</b> of 21 August 1994 and 31 January 1997) includes three ΔTs (those for 1994, 1995, and 1996).

The same procedure was applied to pairs 2 and 5, to which the ΔTs for 1992 and 1997 were assigned, respectively. For pairs 1 and 5, whose intervals are less than 1 year, ΔT was selected as the largest 2 -week increase in temperature after 21 October 1991 (pair 1) and the largest 2 -week increase in temperature in 2000, between <b>the</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>dates</b> (pair 5).|$|R

40|$|This study {{isolated}} <b>the</b> {{effects of}} <b>acquisitions</b> on <b>the</b> long term risk-return performance of acquiring firms involved in related and unrelated diversifying acquisitions. Confounding effects of multiple acquisitions were controlled by studying only those firms {{that were involved}} in a single major acquisition over a ten year period surrounding <b>the</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>date.</b> <b>Acquisitions</b> did not improve the profitability performance of acquiring firms. Although not statistically significant, firms involved in related acquisitions experienced profitability setbacks. On the risk dimensions, the overall risk of acquiring firms involved in related <b>acquisitions</b> increased in <b>the</b> post-acquisition period. Risk pooling advantages were associated with unrelated mergers as demonstrated by their abiliity to maintain their risk profile. Risk-return relationships were found to be negative for firms involved in both kinds of acquisitions. Firms that succeeded in reducing total or financial risk enjoyed superior returns.
