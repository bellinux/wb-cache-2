The {{prosecution}} {{was led by}} Anthony Arlidge QC, and the defence by Geoffrey Rivlin QC, supported by Ed Lawson QC. The Times wrote that Bamber cut an arrogant figure in the witness box. At one point when prosecutors accused him of lying, he replied: [...] "That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got to establish." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the five-hour BBC adaptation, Wright compressed his film into two hours and nine minutes of screen time. He remarked that the film is [...] "obviously about Elizabeth and Darcy, following them and anything that detracts or diverts you from that story <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to cut". Some of the most notable changes from the original book include time compression of several major sequences, including the departure of Wickham and the militia, Elizabeth's visit to Rosings Park and Hunsford Parsonage, Elizabeth's visit to Pemberley, Lydia's elopement and subsequent crisis; the elimination of several supporting characters, including Mr and Mrs Hurst, Mr and Mrs Phillips, Lady and Maria Lucas, Mrs Younge, several of Lydia's friends (including Colonel and Mrs Forster) and various military officers and townspeople; {{and the elimination of}} several sections in which characters reflect or converse on events that have recently occurred—for example, Elizabeth's chapter-long change of mind after reading Darcy's letter.|$|E

500|$|West's {{breakthrough}} came a {{year later}} on October 23, 2002, when, while driving home from a California recording studio after working late, he fell {{asleep at the wheel}} and was involved in a near-fatal car crash. The crash left him with a shattered jaw, which had to be wired shut in reconstructive surgery. The accident inspired West; two weeks after being admitted to the hospital, he recorded a song at the Record Plant Studios with his jaw still wired shut. The composition, [...] "Through The Wire", expressed West's experience after the accident, and helped lay the foundation for his debut album, as according to West [...] "all the better artists have expressed what they were going through". West added that [...] "the album was my medicine", as working on the record distracted him from the pain. [...] "Through The Wire" [...] was first available on West's Get Well Soon... mixtape, released December 2002. At the same time, West announced that he was working on an album called The College Dropout, whose overall theme was to [...] "make your own decisions. Don't let society tell you, 'This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to do.'" ...|$|E

[...] The album saw West tear down the outdated idea that rappers had {{to be a part of}} the gang life to create rap music. West never gave into the stereotype of the street kid who grew up in a tough world where the only form of survival was to join the gang. He was none of that, nor did he ever try to be any of that. West became a rapper in his own right, without adapting his style, without changing his appearance, without making his music fit the mold that those in the rap industry expected.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{passengers}} of the bus approached Treviño Morales weeping and saying: [...] "Please, sir. I {{do not want to}} do this. I will give you all the money I have and my own house, but please let us go." [...] Treviño Morales stared at him firmly, took away his club and then said, [...] "Okay, stupid asshole. Leave," [...] and while the crying man was walking away, Treviño Morales swung his bat and hit him {{in the back of the}} head—and then struck him more than 20 times until his head was completely destroyed. He then turned around and said to the kidnapped victims: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to do. Have some balls (courage). Anyone who does not want to can tell me and I will beat the hell out of you." [...] All of the men started fighting. Several other Zeta members, who were still on a bus with other passengers, ordered the women whom they considered the most beautiful to descend the vehicle so they could rape them. Then they took away the children from their mothers, and shot the rest of the bus passengers. The women were taken to a warehouse where many other women were held captive. Inside a dark room, the women were reportedly raped and beaten, while one heard the screams of the women and of the children being put in acid. A driver of one of the buses was then asked to turn on the bus engine, and then ordered to move the bus to where the kidnapped victims were handcuffed and laid down on the dirt floor. [...] "Drive on top of them," [...] one of the killers told the bus driver, who stood there motionless. [...] "Drive on top of them or I will put you there too, asshole," [...] the killer repeated. As the driver rode over his passengers with the bus, he felt like the vehicle was passing over speed bumps, but the only difference was that the bus driver and {{the passengers}} could actually hear the cries of the people as they were being run over. The gunmen, once the driver was finished, shot him in the head and shot the rest on board. The bus was then set on fire by the Zetas. Treviño Morales then gathered all the Zetas and said, [...] "We have had enough fun for tonight. Bring the winners." [...] His men brought all of those who had passed the gladiator-like competitions, and they were gathered in front of Treviño Morales.|$|E
