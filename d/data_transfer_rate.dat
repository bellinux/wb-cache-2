5|$|The USB2.0 {{specification}} {{was released}} in April 2000 and was ratified by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) {{at the end of}} 2001. Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Lucent Technologies (now Nokia), NEC, and Philips jointly led the initiative to develop a higher <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate,</b> with the resulting specification achieving 480Mbit/s, 40 times as fast as the original USB 1.1 specification.|$|E
5|$|The USB 3.0 {{specification}} {{was published}} on 12 November 2008. Its main goals were {{to increase the}} <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> (up to 5Gbit/s), decrease power consumption, increase power output, and be backward compatible with USB 2.0. USB 3.0 includes a new, higher speed bus called SuperSpeed in parallel with the USB 2.0 bus. For this reason, the new version is also called SuperSpeed. The first USB 3.0 equipped devices were presented in January 2010.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the filming}} was completed, more than 20 two-hour Beta SP video tapes of footage {{had to be}} edited down to fit {{the actions of the}} game. The {{programming}} included editing the original video footage, and mixing the rendered images of doors, drawers, chairs and other objects into the footage frame-by-frame, which was necessary for more than 100 scenes. The game required more polishing and fine-tuning than most games of its time due to the many video components, and the programmers had to determine the desired frame rate, <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> and desired resolution of the video elements. Another challenge for the game was CD resource management. Since many of the scenes in the game could be repeated in multiple chapters, some pieces of the code were written onto several different CDs {{to reduce the number of}} times the player had to swap discs in the middle of a chapter, an unusual practice for computer games at the time. The final game was on seven discs, a large number for a computer game, and more than the four or five discs originally expected.|$|E
50|$|The {{defining}} {{characteristics of}} a LAN, {{in contrast to a}} wide area network (WAN), include higher <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates,</b> limited geographic range, and lack of reliance on leased lines to provide connectivity. Current Ethernet or other IEEE 802.3 LAN technologies operate at <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> up to 100 Gbit/s, standarized by IEEE in 2010. Currently, 400 Gbit/s Ethernet is being developed.|$|R
50|$|Wireless <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> (measured in Mbit/s); these {{range from}} 2 Mbit/s to 54 Mbit/s.|$|R
50|$|Modern UDMA-7 CompactFlash Cards provide {{data rates}} up to 145 Mbytes/sec and require USB 3.0 <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R
25|$|HDD <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> {{depends upon}} the {{rotational}} speed of the platters and the data recording density. Because heat and vibration limit rotational speed, advancing density becomes the main method to improve sequential transfer rates. Higher speeds require a more powerful spindle motor, which creates more heat. While areal density advances by increasing both the number of tracks across the disk {{and the number of}} sectors per track, only the latter increases the <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> for a given rpm. Since <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> performance tracks only one of the two components of areal density, its performance improves at a lower rate.|$|E
25|$|UHS-II: Specified in version 4.0, further {{raises the}} <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> to a {{theoretical}} maximum of 156MB/s (full duplex) or 312MB/s (half duplex) using an additional {{row of pins}} (a total of 17 pins for full-size and 16 pins for micro-size cards).|$|E
25|$|In digital {{communication}} systems, the physical layer gross bitrate, raw bitrate, data signaling rate, gross <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> or uncoded transmission rate (sometimes written as a variable Rb or fb) {{is the total}} number of physically transferred bits per second over a communication link, including useful data as well as protocol overhead.|$|E
30|$|The {{presented}} implementation obtained <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> on {{the order}} of magnitude of Gbps. At 150 MHz, the communication bus achieved <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> of up to 4.76 Gbps. Although the obtained <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> were satisfactory, the use of LVDS pins would certainly provide higher <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates.</b> Taking the <b>data</b> presented in [6] as reference, if it was possible to instantiate 32 lanes on the communication bus, each one with rates of 625 Mbps, {{it would be possible to}} obtain transfers up to 20 Gbps.|$|R
50|$|The Wi-Fi {{standard}} IEEE 802.11ad will {{utilize the}} 60 GHz (EHF microwave) spectrum with <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> {{of up to}} 7 Gbit/s.|$|R
50|$|The Wi-Fi {{standard}} IEEE 802.11ad {{operates in}} the 60 GHz (V band) spectrum to achieve <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> {{as high as}} 7 Gbit/s.|$|R
25|$|As an example, the goodput or <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> of a V.92 {{voiceband}} modem {{is affected}} by the modem physical layer and data link layer protocols. It is sometimes higher than the physical layer data rate due to V.44 data compression, and sometimes lower due to bit-errors and automatic repeat request retransmissions.|$|E
25|$|DDR3-xxx denotes <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate,</b> and {{describes}} DDR chips, whereas PC3-xxxx denotes theoretical bandwidth (with {{the last two}} digits truncated), and is used to describe assembled DIMMs. Bandwidth is calculated by taking transfers per second and multiplying by eight. This is because DDR3 memory modules transfer data on a bus that is 64 data bits wide, and since a byte comprises 8 bits, this equates to 8 bytes of data per transfer.|$|E
25|$|Goodput or <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> {{refers to}} the {{achieved}} average net bit rate that is delivered to the application layer, exclusive of all protocol overhead, data packets retransmissions, etc. For example, {{in the case of}} file transfer, the goodput corresponds to the achieved file transfer rate. The file transfer rate in bit/s can be calculated as the file size (in bytes) divided by the file transfer time (in seconds) and multiplied by eight.|$|E
50|$|Piconet range varies {{according}} to the class of the Bluetooth device. <b>Data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> vary between about 200 and 2100 kilobits per second.|$|R
5000|$|Floppy {{disk drives}} have {{sustained}} [...] "disk-to-buffer" [...] <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> that are {{one or two}} orders of magnitude {{lower than that of}} HDDs.|$|R
5000|$|Link {{aggregation}} (also {{known as}} bonding, trunking or teaming) allows {{the use of}} multiple ports for the same connection achieving higher <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{bit rate}} or <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> (once {{the head is}} in the right position) creates delay which is a {{function}} of the number of blocks transferred; typically relatively small, but can be quite long with the transfer of large contiguous files.|$|E
2500|$|... {{a typical}} 7,200-rpm desktop HDD has a {{sustained}} [...] "disk-to-buffer" [...] <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> up to 1,030Mbit/s. This rate {{depends on the}} track location; the rate is higher for data on the outer tracks (where there are more data sectors per rotation) and lower toward the inner tracks (where there are fewer data sectors per rotation); and is generally somewhat higher for 10,000-rpm drives. A current widely used standard for the [...] "buffer-to-computer" [...] interface is 3.0Gbit/s SATA, which can send about 300 megabyte/s (10-bit encoding) from the buffer to the computer, and thus is still comfortably ahead of today's disk-to-buffer transfer rates. <b>Data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> (read/write) can be measured by writing a large file to disk using special file generator tools, then reading back the file. Transfer rate can be influenced by file system fragmentation and {{the layout of the}} files.|$|E
2500|$|DDR4-xxxx denotes per-bit <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate,</b> and is {{normally}} {{used to describe}} DDR chips. [...] PC4-xxxxx denotes overall transfer rate, in megabytes per second, and applies only to modules (assembled DIMMs). Because DDR4 memory modules transfer data on a bus that is 8 bytes (64 data bits) wide, module peak transfer rate is calculated by taking transfers per second and multiplying by eight.|$|E
50|$|Beyond the kernal table IDEDOS has two new {{calls for}} bulk data {{handling}} (read/write) which allows much faster <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> than the character-based I/O.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{high end}} {{dual-band}} wireless routers have <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> of at most 300 Mbit/s (For 2.4 GHz band) and 450 Mbit/s (For 5 GHz band).|$|R
2500|$|However, other usages still occur. For example, in one document, Seagate {{specifies}} <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> {{of some of}} {{its hard}} drives in both IEC and decimal units.|$|R
2500|$|Memory {{transactions}} between 64-bit devices may use all 64bits {{to double}} the <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate.</b> [...] Non-memory transactions (including configuration and I/O space accesses) may not use the 64-bit extension. [...] During a 64-bit burst, burst addressing works just as in a 32-bit transfer, but the address is incremented twice per data phase. [...] The starting address must be 64-bit aligned; i.e. AD2 must be 0. [...] The data corresponding to the intervening addresses (with AD2 = 1) is carried on {{the upper half of}} the AD bus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{physical}} layer net bitrate, information rate, [...] useful bit rate, payload rate, [...] net <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate,</b> coded transmission rate, effective data rate or wire speed (informal language) of a digital communication channel is the capacity excluding the {{physical layer}} protocol overhead, for example {{time division multiplex}} (TDM) framing bits, redundant forward error correction (FEC) codes, equalizer training symbols and other channel coding. Error-correcting codes are common especially in wireless communication systems, broadband modem standards and modern copper-based high-speed LANs. The physical layer net bitrate is the datarate measured at a reference point in the interface between the datalink layer and physical layer, and may consequently include data link and higher layer overhead.|$|E
2500|$|ICT {{businesses}} have experienced an important development with {{the deployment of}} optical fibre in the agglomeration and the implantation of companies specialising in information technology, networks and image processing. The technopoles [...] of Helioparc (close to the University, 1,000 jobs), Pau Cité Multimédia (north of the town, 700 jobs) and the @LLEES (Villa Ridgway built in 1905, former headquarters of Elf) concentrate {{a large number of}} systems integration and computer engineering information technology consulting schools. Pau should, ultimately, be fully connected to a fibre optic network (Pau Broadband Country) of the agglomeration of Pau-Pyrénées communities which will allow a <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> of 10 to 100 megabits per second (and 1 gigabit per second for some companies) and applications of types such as VoIP, online services and webTV. Pau is the third city in Europe, after Stockholm and Milan, to have developed a very high-speed fibre optic network. The project has cost 30 million euros and has been spread over five years. This network has encouraged the location of French and foreign companies to Pau, which are specialised in imaging, services or design online.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> to the PC, {{which are}} {{dependent}} upon the connection method. This affects the maximum sampling rate and resolution achievable by the PCO when streaming.|$|R
25|$|As the Internet is a {{heterogeneous}} network, the physical characteristics, including {{for example the}} <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> of connections, vary widely. It exhibits emergent phenomena that depend on its large-scale organization.|$|R
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} design adapters with {{a smaller}} interpacket gap for slightly higher <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates,</b> {{which can lead to}} a high rate of detected collisions. An example is Intel EtherExpress 100B.|$|R
5000|$|... 500 kB/sec <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> (uncompressed) / 1.0 MB/sec <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> (assuming a 2:1 {{compression}} ratio) ...|$|E
5000|$|For Link 16, <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> {{is between}} 26.8 kbit/s (26,880 bit/s) and 107.5 kbit/s (107,520 bit/s), {{depending}} on the data packing structure. For Link 22, the UHF fixed frequency <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> is 12.7 kbit/s (12,666 bit/s). Link 22 can use multiple networks for one data stream to increase the <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> - The rate {{at which}} user data bits are {{transferred}} from or to the medium. Technically, this would more accurately be entitled the [...] "gross" [...] <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{units for}} data {{capacity}} and <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> generally follow the [...] "decimal" [...] SI prefix convention (e.g. mega = 106) {{and not the}} binary prefix convention (e.g. mega = 220).|$|R
50|$|Modern UDMA-7 CompactFlash Cards and UHS-I Secure Digital cards provide {{data rates}} {{in excess of}} 89 MB/s and up to 145 MB/s, when used with memory card readers capable of USB 3.0 <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R
