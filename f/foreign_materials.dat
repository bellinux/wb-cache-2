5|$|Blood {{lead levels}} are an {{indicator}} mainly of recent or current lead exposure, not of total body burden. Lead in bones {{can be measured}} noninvasively by X-ray fluorescence; {{this may be the}} best measure of cumulative exposure and total body burden. However this method is not widely available and is mainly used for research rather than routine diagnosis. Another radiographic sign of elevated lead levels is the presence of radiodense lines called lead lines at the metaphysis in the long bones of growing children, especially around the knees. These lead lines, caused by increased calcification due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing <b>foreign</b> <b>materials</b> such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|Time, wear, {{and severe}} weather {{conditions}} led to many identified problems, {{the single most}} pervasive being water damage. In building a memorial made of cast concrete covered in stone, Allward had failed {{to take into account}} how these materials would shift over time. The builders and designer failed to incorporate sufficient space between the concrete and stones, which resulted in water infiltrating the structure through its walls and platforms, dissolving lime in the concrete foundation and masonry. As the water exited, it deposited the lime on exterior surfaces, obscuring many of the names inscribed thereon. Poor drainage and water flows off the monument also caused significant deterioration of the platform, terrace, and stairs. The restoration project intended to address the root causes of damage and included repairs to the stone, walkways, walls, terraces, stairs, and platforms. In order to respect Allward's initial vision of a seamless structure, the restoration team were required to remove all <b>foreign</b> <b>materials</b> employed in patchwork repairs, replace damaged stones with material from the original quarry in Croatia, and correct all minor displacement of stones caused by the freeze-thaw activity. Underlying structural flaws were also corrected.|$|E

40|$|For uniform quality, {{potatoes}} must {{be sufficiently}} ventilated during their storage in boxes. Soil and other <b>foreign</b> <b>material</b> that enters the box {{together with the}} harvest can impede ventilation. The proportion and distribution of <b>foreign</b> <b>material</b> in the potato boxes are therefore of interest, as both parameters have a crucial influence on the ventilation of the potatoes. In connection with the testing of a potato harvester that fills the potatoes in storage boxes on the machine, {{the aim was to}} clarify what proportion and what distribution the <b>foreign</b> <b>material</b> assumes in the box. For reference purposes boxes located on a transport vehicle were filled from the potato harvester hopper too. The content of <b>foreign</b> <b>material</b> and its distribution in the storage boxes were determined using a tipping method and a sampling cylinder method. The examinations were concentrated on <b>foreign</b> <b>material</b> with a diameter of less than 2 cm. In addition, {{the extent to which the}} storage boxes were filled was determined by weighing. It turned out that filling the boxes on the harvester leads to uniform distribution of <b>foreign</b> <b>material</b> by contrast with filling boxes located on the transport vehicle. Thanks to gentle filling on the harvester, the clods did not disintegrate into loose soil so that there was only a small proportion of <b>foreign</b> <b>material</b> with a diameter of less than 2 cm...|$|R

500|$|Various {{elemental}} {{analyses of}} diamond reveal {{a wide range}} of impurities. They mostly originate, however, from inclusions of <b>foreign</b> <b>materials</b> in diamond, which could be nanometer-small and invisible in an optical microscope. Also, virtually any element can be hammered into diamond by ion implantation. More essential are elements which can be introduced into the diamond lattice as isolated atoms (or small atomic clusters) during the diamond growth. By 2008, those elements are nitrogen, boron, hydrogen, silicon, phosphorus, nickel, cobalt and perhaps sulfur. Manganese and tungsten have been unambiguously detected in diamond, but they might originate from foreign inclusions. Detection of isolated iron in diamond has later been re-interpreted in terms of micro-particles of ruby produced during the diamond synthesis. Oxygen is believed to be a major impurity in diamond, but it has not been spectroscopically identified in diamond yet. Two electron paramagnetic resonance centers (OK1 and N3) have been assigned to nitrogen–oxygen complexes. However, the assignment is indirect and the corresponding concentrations are rather low (few parts per million).N ENDOR of the OK1 centre in natural type Ib diamond | journal = Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter | volume = 1 | issue = 51 | pages = 10549 | year = 1989 | pmc = |bibcode = 1989JPCM....110549N }} ...|$|E

It assumed control of over 3,000 {{engineers}} from the US Army, US Navy, US Air Force and US Marine Corps, having {{taken over the}} duty from the 130th Engineer Brigade which was departing {{following the end of}} its deployment. During the deployment, the brigade had five principle duties: route clearance and sanitation, rapid crater repair, engineer support to the 3rd Infantry Division and other combat units, planning, design and construction of contingency operating bases, and command of tactical bridging assets. The first major project of the brigade after arriving in country in September 2006 was to assist Iraqi engineers in repairing and operating the run down and damaged water treatment plant at Al Bakir which provided a major source of fresh water from the Tigris River. The brigade allowed Iraqi engineers to lead this operation and played a supporting role in evaluating their work. One of the brigade's major projects was the construction of Forward Operating Base (FOB) Hammer, which was completed in just 45 days. The base required construction materials {{from all over the country}} as well as <b>foreign</b> <b>materials</b> brought to Camp Victory and Balad Air Base. The 411th Brigade's attached B CO 92nd EN BN soldiers focused primarily on land work, perimeter fences and ground fortifications totaling over nine kilometers, with a detachment from the RED HORSE USAF focused on construction of buildings and other [...] "vertical" [...] projects. After completion, the FOB had space for 4,000 soldiers, and was occupied by 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division.|$|E

[...] The GIMI instrument has two coaligned cameras for simultaneous observations of selected targets. Camera 1, which is sensitive in the 75-110nm range, will primarily be used for observations of the dayside ionosphere, auroras, and stellar occultations, and for star field surveys. Camera 2 is sensitive in the 131-160 and 131-200nm far-UV wavelength ranges and will be used for observations of the nightside ionosphere, airglow, stellar occultations, star field surveys, and also gas releases and rocket plumes at night.|$|E
2500|$|The Decree of March 31, 1821 {{brought the}} [...] "Tribunal do Santo Oficio" [...] (the Inquisition) to an end, {{because it is}} found to be [...] "incompatible with the {{principles}} adopted as basis for the Constitution", being [...] "the spiritual and the merely ecclesiastical causes" [...] returned to the [...] "Episcopal Jurisdiction". The Constitution of 1822 established the freedom of the press ("the free communication of thoughts"), without the need for prior censorship, though it still reserved the possibility for any abuse to be punished [...] "in the cases and the way the law determines". The censorship in matters of religion was left, reserved to the ecclesiastical episcopal power, being the government obligated to help the bishops in punishing whoever was found guilty. This period of relative freedom, would however, be a short one. With the Vilafrancada, one year later, prior censorship was once again reintroduced. On November 13, John VI, aware of the revolutionary influences that were coming into the country through several newspapers printed abroad, extended censorship also to include international papers, which would, from then on, require a royal license to enter the country. From 1824, censorship was handled by two instances (being the third one, the Inquisition definitely extinct): the [...] "Censura do Ordinário" [...] (Ordinary Censor) and the [...] "Desembargo do Paço" [...] (roughly the Custom House Censor, for <b>foreign</b> <b>materials).</b>|$|E
