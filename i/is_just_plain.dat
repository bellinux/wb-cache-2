500|$|McKinley {{was easily}} re-elected as {{governor}} in 1893. [...] Despite the poor economic times in Ohio, he remained popular, and spoke {{across much of}} the nation for Republican candidates. [...] He followed the usual Ohio custom and stepped {{down at the end of}} two two-year terms, returning home to Canton in January 1896 to municipal celebrations. [...] The Canton Repository stated, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> Mr. McKinley of Canton now, but wait a little while." [...] To devote full-time to McKinley's presidential campaign, Hanna in 1895 turned over management of his companies to his brother Leonard. Mark Hanna was certain, as he stated as McKinley's campaign began, that [...] "nothing short of a miracle or death will prevent his being the nominee of the party in '96".|$|E
500|$|The game's {{graphics}} and sounds were {{also met with}} muted enthusiasm. Kasavin complained of Deus Exs relatively sub-par graphics, blaming them on the game's [...] "incessantly dark industrial environments." [...] GamePro reviewer Chris Patterson {{took the time to}} note that despite being [...] "solid acoustically," [...] Deus Ex had moments of weakness. He poked fun at JC's [...] "Joe Friday, 'just the facts, deadpan," [...] and the [...] "truly cheesy accents" [...] of minor characters in Hong Kong and New York City. IGN called the graphics [...] "blocky", adding that [...] "the animation is stiff, and the dithering <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> awful in some spots," [...] referring to the limited capabilities of the Unreal Engine used to design the game. the website, later on, stated that [...] "overall Deus Ex certainly looks better than your average game." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{also criticized}} the game's controls, {{especially}} Shadow's homing attack causing unexpected character deaths. Game Informers Matt Helgeson {{complained that the}} attack [...] "frequently sends you careening off into nothingness, resulting in cheap death after cheap death." [...] Nintendo Power, X-Play, Eurogamer, Official Xbox Magazine, and GameSpy agreed. Other complaints focused on the mechanics of weapons and vehicles. Greg Mueller of GameSpot felt that the guns were nearly useless {{because of a lack}} of a target lock or manual aim, combined with an ineffective auto-aim. IGN staff writer Matt Casamassina, 1UP.com staff writer Greg Sewart, Game Informer, X-Play, GameSpy, and London's The Times also criticized the mechanics of Shadow's weapons, vehicles, and other aspects of the game's controls. However, Thomason claimed that [...] "blasting Shadow's foes with the wide variety of weapons at his disposal <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote [...] "That {{the song}} <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> good, {{regardless}} of genre, proves that Jay and Rihanna, who's already scored hits across several formats {{with a string}} of singles that couldn't be more different from each other, are dedicated to producing quality hits—however frivolous they may be." [...] Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters.com said that [...] ""Umbrella" [...] is a monster, so much so that I'll even confess to spending a portion of a rainy afternoon practicing the hook." [...] Jonah Weiner of Blender magazine called the song the album's highlight and stated that it [...] "would be far less engrossing if it wasn't for the way Rihanna disassembles its ungainly title into 11 hypnotic, tongue-flicking syllables". The New York Times Kelefa Sanneh described the song as [...] "a space-age hip-pop song".|$|E
500|$|... "What You Waiting For?" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Nick Sylvester of Pitchfork gave the song a strong review, rating it {{four and a}} half stars, and labeled it [...] "fucking great". The website went on to rank the song 16th on its list of the Top 50 Singles of 2004. RJ Smith of Blender noted the song's new wave influence by stating that it could start a revival of Missing Persons, and Amy Linden of The Village Voice compared the [...] "giddy, yodeling vocals" [...] to those of Lene Lovich's 1981 song [...] "New Toy". Jason Damas from PopMatters was mixed on the song, calling the opening [...] "awkward" [...] and the refrain [...] "ridiculously dumb", but arguing that the song [...] "is so frivolous and stupid that it winds up being brilliant; it pretends to be nothing more than party bubblegum and achieves its artistic criteria beautifully." [...] Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani agreed, stating that [...] "it's this impishness that helps make 'What You Waiting For' one of the hottest 'arrival' songs of all time". Richard Smirke of Playlouder found the track's production [...] "crisp" [...] and [...] "edgy", and Jennifer Nine of Yahoo! Music called the song [...] "itchily irresistible". Jemma Volp-Fletcher, writing for Contactmusic.com, rated the song nine out of 10, commenting that it has [...] "irresistible commercial pull and a melody to die for" [...] and that the track [...] "makes the most of her unmistakable vocal and reflects that off-the-wall Stefani personality perfectly." [...] Natasha Tripney from musicOMH gave the song a negative review, stating that [...] "it'll become one of those tracks that's irritatingly catchy—but on this initial listening, Ms Stefani's debut solo effort <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> irritating." ...|$|E

[...] By all accounts, Frost/Nixon does a fine job of dramatizing the negotiations and preparation that led up to the interviews. And it’s hard to imagine Frank Langella, who plays a Brezhnev-looking Nixon, giving a bad performance. Still, the movie’s fundamental premise <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> wrong." [...] Though generally approving, critic Daniel Eagan notes that partisans on both sides have questioned the accuracy of the film's script.|$|E
2500|$|Tracy E. Hopkins of Barnes & Noble {{wrote that}} the song [...] "won't wow too many fans with its nursery rhyme-like." [...] Spence D. of IGN was mixed, writing, [...] "The {{obligatory}} star power guest shot occurs with 'Call On Me' featuring Nelly. Janet goes for her delicate wisp, but {{it sounds as if}} she's trying hard to maintain the crispness, straining to keep from cracking. Nelly delivers a slippery grind, making this also the obligatory 'time to get your sex on' number." [...] Don Baiocchi of Blogcritics was mixed, writing that [...] "to kick off a comeback with the mediocre 'Call On Me,' a duet where she actually makes Nelly sing, <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> wrong. 'Call on Me' wasn't the way to do that." [...] He also noted that [...] "details like the tiny hand claps in 'Call On Me' are bizarre missteps." [...] Evan Serpick of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "it shamelessly re-creates 'Dilemma,' the St. Louis rapper's collaboration with Kelly Rowland." [...] Johnny Loftus of Metro Times was also negative, writing that the song [...] "falls flat." ...|$|E

2500|$|Album of the Year was {{released}} in 1997 and featured yet another new guitarist, Jon Hudson, who was a former roommate of Billy Gould. The album debuted much higher than expected in some countries (for example, in Germany, the album debuted at No.2 and stayed in the chart for 5 months). In Australia, Album of the Year went to No.1 and was certified Platinum. The album charted in many countries in Europe. To date, Album of the Year has sold around 2 million copies worldwide. [...] The singles [...] "Ashes to Ashes" [...] and [...] "Last Cup of Sorrow" [...] had minimal success (notably, the music video for [...] "Last Cup of Sorrow", which featured actress Jennifer Jason Leigh, {{was inspired by the}} Alfred Hitchcock film Vertigo). [...] "Stripsearch" [...] {{was released}} as a single in various countries (excluding the US and UK). The album received largely negative reviews from US-based critics at the time. Rolling Stone magazine wrote in their original review [...] " [...] are floundering around desperately, groping for a sense of identity and direction in a decade that clearly finds them irrelevant", while Pitchfork Media stated [...] "Album Of The Year leaves one feeling like waking up and finding last night's used condom -- sure, the ride was fun while it lasted, but what remains <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>plain</b> icky.
