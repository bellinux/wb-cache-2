5|$|After {{the liberation}} of Ethiopia, Emperor Haile Selassie I asked the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to help him to {{establish}} an airline {{as part of his}} modernisation effort. According to the BBC News {{it is possible that the}} Emperor <b>intended</b> <b>the</b> creation of a quality national airline to help dispel impressions of Ethiopian poverty. In 1945, the Ethiopian government began negotiations with both Transcontinental Air Transport and Western Air Express (later merged into TWA). On 8 September 1945, TWA signed an agreement with the American historian and foreign affairs advisor to Ethiopia John H. Spencer to establish a commercial aviation company in Ethiopia.|$|E

McKinley refused, and Cortelyou arranged for additional security for the trip. On September 5, the President delivered his address at the fairgrounds, before a crowd of some 50,000 people. In his final speech, McKinley urged reciprocity treaties with other nations to assure American manufacturers access to foreign markets. He <b>intended</b> <b>the</b> speech as a keynote to his plans for a second term.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{proclamation}} of independence, neither the Belgian nor the Congolese government <b>intended</b> <b>the</b> colonial social order to end immediately. The Belgian government hoped that whites might keep their position indefinitely. The Republic of the Congo was still reliant on colonial {{institutions like the}} Force Publique to function from day to day, and white technical experts, installed by the Belgians, were retained in the broad absence of suitably qualified black Congolese replacements (partly the result of colonial restrictions regarding higher education). Many Congolese people had assumed that independence would produce tangible and immediate social change, so the retention of whites in positions of importance was widely resented.|$|E

The Leningrad première was performed by the surviving musicians of the Leningrad Radio Orchestra, supplemented with military performers.

This put the Germans under a pressure of time, as the aircraft would eventually run out of fuel.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Wide-Scope {{approach}} to instrumental reason holds that <b>the</b> requirement to <b>intend</b> <b>the</b> necessary means to your ends {{should be understood}} as a requirement to either <b>intend</b> <b>the</b> means, or else not <b>intend</b> <b>the</b> end. In this paper I explain and defend a neglected version of this approach. I argue that three serious objections to the Wide-Scope approach turn on a certain assumption {{about the nature of the}} reasons that ground the Wide-Scope requirement. The version of the Wide-Scope approach defended here allows us to reject this assumption, and so defuse the objections. It is widely agreed that an account of practical rationality must include an instrumental principle – a requirement to intend what you believe to be the necessary means to your <b>intended</b> ends. <b>The</b> idea can be motivated by thinking about some simple cases. Suppose that you are at <b>the</b> fair, <b>intend</b> to ride <b>the</b> rollercoaster and believe that in order to ride you must stand in line. If you nonetheless do not intend to stand in line, something has gone wrong. You are irrational in a particularly clear and striking way: you fail to <b>intend</b> <b>the</b> believed necessary means to an intended end. Notice that nothing was said about the reasons there are to ride the rollercoaster, or even the reasons you think there are. It might be, for instance, that you ought not to b...|$|R
5|$|In about 1332 Ivan Alexander had crowned {{his eldest}} son Michael Asen IV co-emperor, perhaps to {{safeguard}} possession of the throne by his own family. He followed up this traditional association with the coronation of his younger sons Ivan Sracimir and Ivan Asen IV in 1337. Ivan Alexander may have <b>intended</b> <b>the</b> creation of two younger co-emperors to establish immediate control over important cities and regions, as Ivan Sracimir was eventually based in Vidin, and Ivan Asen IV perhaps in Preslav. Nevertheless, this was a marked departure from Byzantine practice, in which younger sons of the sovereign were made despotēs, whether they were charged with a territorial administration or not.|$|E

Royal Flying Corps (RFC) observers had noted {{the existence of}} works curiously resembling the Canadian positions, well behind the German lines. The Germans were also observed digging new sap trenches which implied that an assault was <b>intended.</b> <b>The</b> Canadian Corps had just begun developing plans to overrun the more dangerous German positions, when the Germans executed an assault of their own.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} year Schubert's brother Ferdinand sold the sonatas' autographs to another publisher, Anton Diabelli, who would only publish them about ten years later, in 1838 or 1839. Schubert had <b>intended</b> <b>the</b> sonatas to be dedicated to Johann Nepomuk Hummel, whom he greatly admired. Hummel was a leading pianist, a pupil of Mozart, and a pioneering composer of the Romantic style (like Schubert himself). However, {{by the time the}} sonatas were published in 1839, Hummel was dead, and Diabelli, the new publisher, decided to dedicate them instead to composer Robert Schumann, who had praised many of Schubert's works in his critical writings.|$|E

5|$|Lee made Sally's Beauty Spot, a 12-minute-long {{short film}} {{focusing}} on a mole on her sister's right breast, for a film editing class at NYU in 1990. For the film she used a second-hand Bolex camera and edited it with a Steenbeck editing suite. She later recalled that she recorded the film while in her pyjamas. The production cost a total of $4,000. Fellow Canadian filmmaker David Weaver described it as sexualizing Sally's body, something that Lee had not <b>intended.</b> <b>The</b> film was first screened at the Festival of Festivals in Toronto. After graduation, Lee spent time as a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art before returning to Canada.|$|E
