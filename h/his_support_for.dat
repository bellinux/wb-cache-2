In {{the last months of}} his life, however, MalcolmX began to reconsider <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> black nationalism after meeting northern African revolutionaries who, to all appearances, were white.|$|E

5|$|The king, while Catholic, {{was very}} {{tolerant}} {{and did not}} support the more aggressive policies of the Counter-Reformation. When he took power, the Senate of Poland had 6 Protestant members; {{at the time of his}} death, it had 11. Despite <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> religious tolerance, he did fail, however, to resolve the conflict stemming from the Union of Brest split. Despite <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the Protestants, he did not stop the growing tide of intolerance, either in Poland or abroad, as shown by the fate of the Racovian Academy, or an international disagreement between the faiths. Neither did he get involved with the disagreement about the Orthodox Cossacks, a group that he respected and counted on in his plans.|$|E

When World War I broke out, he and his Legions fought under Austrian army control against Russia.

5|$|Finding the {{financial}} demands of his Maidstone seat too much, Disraeli secured a Tory nomination for Shrewsbury, winning {{one of the}} constituency's two seats at the 1841 general election, despite serious opposition, and heavy debts which opponents seized on.

Though disappointed at being left on the back benches, he continued <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Peel in 1842 and 1843, seeking to establish himself as an expert on foreign affairs and international trade.|$|E

In his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom, Friedman advocated policies such as a volunteer military, freely floating exchange rates, abolition of medical licenses, a negative income tax, and school vouchers. <b>His</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> school choice led him to found the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, later renamed EdChoice.|$|E
