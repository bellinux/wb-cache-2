40|$|Abstract To {{investigate}} the deformation properties of TiC-(5 - 20) mol % Mo solid solution single crystals at high temperature by compression testing, single crystals of various compositions were grown by the radio frequency floating zone technique and were deformed by compression at temperature from 1250 K to 2270 K at strain rates from 5. 1 × 10 − 5 to 5. 9 × 10 − 3 /s. The plastic flow property of solid solution single crystals {{was found to}} be clearly different among a three-temperature range (low, intermediate and high temperature ranges) whose boundaries were dependent on the strain rate. From the observed property, we conclude that the deformation in the low temperature range is controlled by the Peierls mechanism, in the intermediate temperature range by the dynamic strain aging and in the <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> by the solute atmosphere dragging mechanism. The work softening tends to become less evident with an increasing experimental temperature and with a decreasing strain rate. The temperature and strain rate dependence of the critical resolved shear stress is the strongest in the <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range.</b> The curves are divided into three parts with different slopes by a transition temperature. The critical resolved shear stress (τ 0. 2) at the <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> showed that Mo content dependence of τ 0. 2 with temperature and the dependence is very marke...|$|E

40|$|The {{isothermal}} curing of polymethacrylimide (PMI) is studied {{through the}} use of dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Based on the growth rate of measured dynamic mechanical property, the relative conversion is defined to investigate the evolution of storage modulus E′ at different curing temperatures.

The characteristic vibration modes of aliphatic C–H stretching and C=O stretching could be identified in all four distillates at 2850 – 2980  cm− 1 and around 1710  cm− 1 respectively. The characteristic stretching vibration of carboxylic –OH was observed as a very broad band in all four spectra extending from 2400 to 3400  cm− 1 indicating {{the presence of}} carboxylic acids.
