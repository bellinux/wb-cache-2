40|$|Background and PurposeNapiergrass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumacher) and pangolagrass (Digitaria decumbens Stent) are {{two major}} forage grasses for cow feeding. They possess high yields and high {{regeneration}} properties. Inoculation of cellulolytic microbes on herbage could enhance the protein content of herbage and promote digestibility in chickens. MethodsCellulolytic microbes were isolated from various sources and cultivated on napiergrass and pangolagrass with solid-state fermentation for protein enrichment and in vitro digestion improvement. The fermented napiergrass and pangolagrass were used as the main protein source in chicken diets to assess the feasibility <b>for</b> <b>non-ruminants</b> feed. ResultsAfter a 42 -day fermentation period, napiergrass showed higher protein contents (13. 4 – 13. 9 %) than those of pangolagrass(11. 1 – 11. 7 %). The in vitro digestibility of pangolagrass increased from 5. 29 % to 20. 4 %, whereas that of napiergrass increased from 5. 29 % to 19. 0 %. The average feed conversion efficiencies of chickens were close to the traditional fodder using corn as the main ingredient.

40|$|Increasing {{efficiency}} in livestock production {{and reducing the}} share of animal products in human consumption are two strategies to curb the adverse environmental impacts of the livestock sector. Here,we explore the roomfor sustainable livestock production by modelling the impacts and constraints of a third strategy in which livestock feed components that compete with direct human food crop production are reduced. Thus, in the outmost scenario, animals are fed only from grassland and by-products from food production. We show that this strategy could provide sufficient food (equal amounts of human-digestible energy and a similar protein/calorie ratio as in the reference scenario for 2050) and reduce environmental impacts comparedwith the reference scenario (in the most extreme case of zero human-edible concentrate feed: greenhouse gas emissions 218 %; arable land occupation 226 %, N-surplus 246 %; P-surplus 240 %; non-renewable energy use 236 %, pesticide use intensity 222 %, freshwater use 221 %, soil erosion potential 212 %). These results occur {{despite the fact that}} environmental efficiency of livestock production is reduced compared with the reference scenario, which is the consequence of the grassland-based feed for ruminants and the less optimal feeding rations based on by-products <b>for</b> <b>non-ruminants.</b> This apparent contradiction results from considerable reductions of animal products in human diets (protein intake per capita from livestock products reduced by 71 %).

40|$|Abstract Canola meal {{is derived}} from the {{crushing}} of canola seed for oil extraction. Although it has been used in swine diets for a long time, its inclusion levels have been limited due to concerns regarding its nutritive value primarily arising from results of early studies showing negative effects of dietary canola meal inclusion in swine diets. Such effects were attributable to the presence of anti-nutritional factors (ANF; notably glucosinolates) in canola meal. However, due to advances in genetic improvements of canola that have led to production of cultivars with significantly lower ANF content and improved processing procedures, canola meal with a superior nutritive value <b>for</b> <b>non-ruminant</b> animals is now available. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} review the recent studies in the use of canola meal as feedstuff for swine, the factors influencing its use and the strategies to overcome them.

30|$|The {{phosphorus}} and inositol in PA {{are generally}} not bioavailable to non-ruminant animals who lack the digestive enzyme phytase that hydrolyzes P from the PA molecule (Mroz et al. 1994; Marounek et al. 2010). In addition, PA inhibits enzymes needed for protein degradation in the stomach and small intestine (Kies et al. 2006). Ruminants are readily able to digest PA because rumen microorganisms produce phytase. To overcome P deficiency in non-ruminants, phytase is usually given as a supplement (Pontoppidan et al. 2007), which then results in excess P excretion leading to environmental problems, such as eutrophication. Therefore, a low-PA (lpa) rice bran would be of greater value <b>for</b> <b>non-ruminant</b> livestock feeds, including poultry, swine, and fish feeds, than would brans derived from normal rice. Furthermore, the rising carbon dioxide concentration ([CO 2]) in the atmosphere and predicted global warming are expected to influence global crop production. Elevated atmospheric [CO 2] will also affect grain micronutrient concentration and will increase the PA content (Myers et al. 2014; Dietterich et al. 2015). In spite of these dire predictions, the need for developing cereals and grains with low-PA levels has not been given the attention this important matter requires.|$|R

The results obtained showed that the FT-IR differentiated quite well between the fat derived from different species of PAPs, especially at the bands of 3, 006 cm- 1 and 722 cm- 1. Results provided evidence that FT-IR differentiated the fat derived from fish meal, terrestrial non-ruminant and ruminant MBM quite well.

40|$|Dried {{distillers}} grain with solubles (DDGS) are a co-product {{of ethanol}} production from starch cereals (mainly maize in North America and wheat in Europe), which contains approximately the non-starch or non-fermentable fractions of the grain. As more becomes available with increasing bio-ethanol production, DDGS is being included {{not only in}} diets for ruminants but also in pig and poultry diets. This review paper considers the introduction possibilities of wheat DDGS in poultry and pig diets. Nutrients content in wheat DDGS and digestibility vary among ethanol plants, reflecting the starch extraction process and drying of the residues after starch extraction. Most of the variability concerns amino acid (AA) contents and their standardized ileal digestibility (SID), affected by the occurrence of Maillard reactions, reflected in the lightness score (L) of wheat DDGS. Samples with low L values (< 50) are dark and have the lowest nutritional value, both in pigs and in poultry. Lysine is the most affected AA, with contents ranging between 0. 9 (dark) and 3. 0 percent of crude protein (CP; N× 6. 25) for wheat DDGS. In parallel, lysine SID is also variable, with the lowest values observed in DDGS with low lysine level in CP. For the darkest products,lysine SID is close to zero. Energy digestibility varies in parallel with changes in lysine content and L values, but is more related to other nutrients such as dietary fibre, fat and residual starch contents. In addition, wheat DDGS can supply significant amounts of available phosphorus. DDGS from wheat {{can be used in}} diets for poultry and pigs; however, in relation with nutritional value variability, practical use should take into account correct energy values or lysine SID content in order to prevent any performance deterioration. Finally, only the light-coloured productsare recommended <b>for</b> <b>non-ruminants,</b> and their introduction at high inclusion rates will contribute to reducing the energy value of the diet...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficient}} use of grains for animal feed {{requires the use of}} analytical methods that can provide rapid indications of the suitability of the grain for animal nutrition. Ideally, these methods need to be applied at the site of grain receival within the tight time and cost confines of grain delivery. In addition, methods are needed in plant breeding to efficiently screen for target aspects of feed-grain quality to facilitate the development of genotypes with improved nutritional quality. This review describes a range of techniques that can fulfil these analytical requirements. These include visual examination of grain samples for species identification and for recognition of defects and contaminants. This long-standing approach is rapid, but it is subjective and dependent on the expertise of the operator. The newer technology of image analysis offers the prospect of providing similar information automatically and quantitatively, without the risk of operator bias. Near-infrared (NIR) analysis is already in general use for grain analysis at many receival depots in wheat-growing countries, mainly for the determination of moisture and protein content. There are promising indications that NIR can be extended to the determination of many other aspects of grain composition, both the positive aspects that contribute to feed quality, as well as components such as beta-glucan content that have negative contributions <b>for</b> <b>non-ruminants.</b> Furthermore, NIR is being developed to provide a direct indication of metabolisable energy for a range of grain types. Whereas NIR is primarily suited to the determination of quantitatively major components of the grain, without the requirement of significant sample preparation, immunological analyses are appropriate for the determination of specific and minor components, such as mycotoxins, lectins, alkaloids, and pesticide residues. These and other methods, suited for on-site analysis, need to be combined with effective sampling to ensure that the results of testing are representative of the whole of the grain consignment, and also integrated into a systematic strategy to ensure cost-effective testing...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of the last decades of the twentieth century, more than 30 new {{diseases}} were determined for the first time in history. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or "mad cow disease" is one of them. The disease implies the subacute neurodegenerative transmission of spongiform encephalopathy and it was diagnosed and described for the first time in Great Britain in 1986. A theory has been established that BSE is spread through feedstuffs, more precisely, meat-bone flour which contains infective proteins of ruminants, and legislature has been passed throughout the world with the objective of preventing the entry of meat-bone flour into the food chain. The complete ban of the use of meat-bone flour for all farm animals (with the exception of fish flour <b>for</b> <b>non-ruminants)</b> and an adequate thermal treatment in the production of meat-bone flour (133 ºC, 3 bar, 20 min) are the elements on which the European Union (EU) legislature is based. The regulations in our country include a ban on the use of meat-bone flour in cattle feedstuffs and a ban on imports of beef proteins. The implementation of this legislature throughout the world requires the corresponding analytical means. At the present time, there are several available possibilities: optic microscopy, PCR, immunoprobes, spectroscopic methods, and several others which are still being examined for use for this purpose. All the analytical methods are being applied with the objective of controlling the implementation of the current regulations, but also in order to discover possible cross contamination that could take place in factories of animal feedstuffs, during transportation, storage, or on farms, in particular when there are no separate lines for feedstuffs that contains meat-bone flour and others in which even its traces are banned. In order to secure the successful control and prevention of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in our country, as well as to secure the unhindered continuation of the integration processes with the European Union, it is necessary to create an adequate system for the monitoring of this disease, not only because of food safety as a precondition for the good health of people, but also for commercial reasons, as that is the only way to have an active role on the world market. ...|$|E
40|$|Variability in the {{nutritional}} value of processed soya bean meal (SBM) and full fat soya bean (FFSB) currently restrict {{its use in}} diets <b>for</b> <b>non-ruminant</b> livestock. Two metabolism trials determined the amino acid digestibility and effect on pancreas size in young broilers of 8 commercially obtained products. Trypsin inhibitor (TI) values varied from 1. 1 to 3. 6 mg/g but were all within the tolerated range of trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA). The results of the trials reported demonstrated that the coefficients of digestibility for individual amino acids varied widely between samples (e. g. coefficient of ileal apparent digestibility, CIAD, for lysine was from 0. 755 to 0. 884 for SBM and 0. 778 to 0. 848 for FFSB) but did not correlate with TIA levels, indicating other factors also affect amino acid digestibility of FFSB and SBM. Pancreas to body weight ratio (PBWR) increased with rate of soya inclusion in both the SBM (from 2. 25 to 2. 44 g pancreas/kg body weight) and the FFSB (from 2. 19 to 2. 40 g pancreas/kg body weight).

Three hundred and twenty broilers, Cobb strain, were housed with one day old until 35 days, and were allotted to a completely randomized design with five levels of canola meal (T 1 - 0 %, T 2 - 10 %, T 3 - 20 %, T 4 - 30 % and T 5 - 40 %) in place of meal soybeans, and eight replicates of eight birds each. The basal diets were formulated based on corn and soybean meal, meeting {{the requirements of the}} birds. To evaluate the effect of inclusion levels of canola, except in sensory analysis, was used polynomial regression analysis. Sensory analysis was applied to analysis of variance and means were compared by Tukey test. In general the variables of weight gain and the average weight of the birds had a quadratic behavior in the different age groups and decreased with the addition of 40 % canola meal. Increased levels of canola meal promoted a linear decrease in the yield of the chest at 35 days of age. The apparent digestibility of dry matter, crude protein and non-extractive nitrogen decreased linearly with increasing inclusion of canola meal. The chemical composition of the leg was not affected, but the chest was an increase in dry matter, ether extract increased and decreased moisture and ash with increasing levels of canola meal. With the inclusion of canola decreased intensity of yellow color of the meat. In sensory evaluation the only difference was found for the residual flavor of meat in 30 % level of inclusion. In intestinal morphology was observed a quadratic effect unbeliever until the 20 % level of inclusion of canola meal in the diet for villi height.

Genetic improvements that increase the levels of lysine, tryptophan, and methionine have been actively sought by researchers for the past fifty years.

A recently published approach 3 tests the hypothesis that amino acid balance in maize kernels can be improved by production of a foreign protein to serve as a sink for amino acids. The foreign protein used in this case is the porcine milk protein alpha-lactalbumin, which is introduced transgenically. The transgene contains a maize seed storage protein gene promoter and a synthetic coding sequence optimized for expression in maize. The coding sequence is modified by the addition of a maize signal sequence and an endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence to direct accumulation of the transgene product only to targeted regions in the cell.

Peas and beans were added at 750 g/kg as the only source of protein/amino acids in a semi-synthetic diet containing the inert marker titanium dioxide; SBM was added, in a control diet, at 500 g/kg. Each diet was fed to six replicates of a cage containing two Ross-type broilers for 96 h at which point birds were culled allowing removal of ileal digesta. Chemical analyses allowed the calculation of the coefficient of SID of amino acids. There were no differences between samples of the same pulse species (P> 0. 05) but peas had higher values (P< 0. 05), similar to SBM, than beans. Trypsin inhibitor content (expressed as g trypsin inhibitor units/mg sample) of all pea samples was low and in the range 0. 83 – 1. 77 mg/kg. There was relatively little variation in bean tannin content and composition amongst the coloured-flowered varieties; however, the white-flowered cultivar had no tannins.

In ruminants, rumen microorganisms are able to produce amino acids that are essential <b>for</b> <b>non-ruminant</b> species. At this age, however, the rumen functions have not been developed yet. Thus, threonine, valine, methio-nine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, lysine and histidine are essential for them as it is the case in monogastric animals (Riis, 1984). Solymos and Horn (1994) stated that the amino acid profile in colostrum consumed at the first sucking is simi-lar to that of uterine milk (embryotroph), except methionine and glutamic acid. Calves are born without sufficient essential amino acid supply. No long-term effect of colostrum intake on blood plasma free amino acids was recorded by Zanker et al.

The chemical composition and physicochemical properties of RSM before and after fermentation were compared. To further understand possible mechanism of solid state fermentation, the composition of extracellular enzymes secreted by Aspergillus niger during fermentation was analysed using two-dimentional difference gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE) combined with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF-MS). Results of the present study indicated that SSF had significant effects on chemical composition of RSM. The fermented rapeseed meal (FRSM) contained more crude protein (CP) and amino acid (AA) (except His) than unfermented RSM. Notably, the small peptide in FRSM was 2. 26 time larger than that in unfermented RSM. Concentrations of anti-nutritional substrates in FRSM including neutral detergent fiber (NDF), glucosinolates, isothiocyanate, oxazolidithione, and phytic acid declined (P < 0. 05) by 13. 47, 43. 07, 55. 64, 44. 68 and 86. 09 %, respectively, compared with unfermented RSM. A. niger fermentation disrupted the surface structure, changed macromolecular organic compounds, and reduced the protein molecular weights of RSM substrate. Total proteins of raw RSM and FRSM were separated and 51 protein spots were selected for mass spectrometry according to 2 D-DIGE map. In identified proteins, there were 15 extracellular hydrolases secreted by A. niger including glucoamylase, acid protease, beta-glucanase, arabinofuranosidase, xylanase, and phytase. Some antioxidant related enzymes also were identified. These findings suggested that A. niger is able to secrete many extracellular degradation enzymes (especially lignocellulosic hydrolyzing enzymes, acid proteases and phytase) during fermentation of RSM, thus altering chemical composition and physicochemical properties of RSM...|$|R

Ostriches (Struthio camelus) have large fermentation chambers and long digesta retention, emus (Dromaius novaehollandiae) have a short gut and short retention times, and rheas (Rhea americana) are intermediate. A recent study showed that ostriches produce as much methane (CH 4) as expected <b>for</b> a similar-sized, <b>non-ruminant</b> mammalian herbivore. We hypothesized that emus and rheas produce less CH 4 than ostriches. We individually measured, by chamber respirometry, the amount of O 2 consumed as well as CO 2 and CH 4 emitted from six adult rheas (body mass 23. 4 ± 8. 3 kg) and two adult emus (33. 5 and 32. 0 kg) during 23 -hour periods on a pelleted lucerne diet. In contrast to previous studies, which classified emus as non-producers, we measured CH 4 emissions at 7. 39 and 6. 25 L/day for emus and 2. 87 ± 0. 82 L/day for rheas, which is close to values expected <b>for</b> similar-sized <b>non-ruminant</b> mammals <b>for</b> both species. O 2 consumption was of a similar magnitude as reported previously. Across ratites CH 4 yield (L/kg dry matter intake) {{was positively correlated with}} mean retention time of food particles in the gut, similar to findings within ruminant species. In ratites, this relationship leads to similar body mass-specific CH 4 production for a high intake/short retention and a low intake/long retention strategy. Therefore, when investigating CH 4 production in herbivorous birds, it is advisable to consider various CH 4 measures, not only yield or absolute daily amount alone...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{structural}} changes in dietary patterns in Asia resulting from economic development are placing increasing {{pressure on the}} existing production systems in the region - particularly those systems producing ruminant meat, non-ruminant meat and milk. This has significant policy implications for {{the countries in the}} region in terms of self-sufficiency goals in these commodities and the associated inter- and intra-regional trade opportunities in the future. Forecasts of ruminant meat, non-ruminant meat and milk production and consumption for selected Asian countries between the years 2000 and 2010 revealed the following: China, Pakistan and Viet Nam are likely to be self-sufficient with respect to ruminant meat; Malaysia is likely to continue to be a net importer of ruminant meat; India and Malaysia will be more than self-sufficient with respect to non-ruminant meat with the converse being true for Pakistan; and India, Laos and Pakistan will be self-sufficient with respect to milk production with the possibility of Indonesia, Thailand and Cambodia becoming self-sufficient if the current trends continue. Structural changes in the early 1980 s generally resulted in higher average annual growth rates of production - particularly is non-ruminant meat production. thus forecasts of ruminant meat production and consumption by 2000 using the medium-term average annual growth rates for production present a more favourable outcome in terms of self-sufficiency for countries such as Bangladesh, the Philippines and Viet Nam but a less favourable outcome for countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Laos and India. Similar forecasts <b>for</b> <b>non-ruminant</b> meat indicated an improvement in the long-term <b>non-ruminant</b> self-sufficiency estimates <b>for</b> most cases-particularly for Bangladesh, China and Cambodia. Intensification and commercialisation of meat production systems have increased meat self-sufficiency in a number of countries but often at the expense of grain self-sufficiency. Given these trends, the impact of trade liberalisation measures on livestock production in the region and inter- and intra-regional trade of livestock commodities and grain is likely to be significant...|$|R

As the use of soy products in foods and feeds increases, it is ever more important to consider the nutritional value of each component of the seed. The carbohydrate component is largely composed of sucrose, raffinose, and stachyose, which represent ~ 10 % of the meal. Both raffinose and stachyose are considered anti-nutritional units; sucrose is considered nutritionally useful. Monogastric animals, including humans, lack the alpha-galactosidase enzyme required for the metabolism of raffinose and stachyose. However, microbes in the gut are able to utilize these carbohydrates causing flatulence and diarrhea; in livestock these complications ultimately reduce market value. The objective of this project is to resolve the undesirable effects of raffinose and stachyose in soybean seeds by elevating the metabolizable energy, sucrose, at the expense of raffinose and stachyose. This change in seed composition has the potential to increase the available metabolizable energy <b>for</b> <b>non-ruminant</b> animals as well as reduce the adverse side effects caused by microbes in the gut. Raffinose is formed by a galactosyl transfer from galactinol to sucrose, mediated by the enzyme raffinose synthase. To date, candidate raffinose synthase genes have been identified and characterized in Williams 82 and a low raffinose line, PI 200508. The genotype of one candidate gene has been completely associated with the low raffinose and stachyose phenotype {{through the use of a}} segregating population and confirmed by an independently characterized EMS induced mutation. Perfect molecular marker assays have been developed and can be utilized for more efficient breeding...|$|R

The sensitivity of the MELISA-TEK assay was improved by applying a specific extraction kit. Six approved blank pork and poultry samples were adulterated to produce 15 samples spiked at 0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 2. 0 % with ruminant material, sterilised at either 133 °C or 137 °C. Fourteen participants investigated the 6 blanks and 15 spiked samples, making 21 samples for the final test. For both assays specificity and sensitivity were at 97 % or higher. Concordance and accordance were higher than 95 % with one exception. The results indicate that both assays provided correct results at 0. 5 % and higher for the detecting ruminant PAPs (sterilised at 133 °C) in non-ruminant PAPs. Given the 2 % upper limit of ruminant PAPs in <b>non-ruminant</b> PAPs <b>for</b> avoiding an increase in BSE incidents, these methods are fit <b>for</b> monitoring <b>non-ruminant</b> PAPs intended <b>for</b> aqua feed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Aethomys namaquensis is a 60 g murid rodent {{that is an}} {{important}} pollinator of several Protea species in South Africa. We compared the nitrogen requirements of this species on two different protein sources: pollen and casein. Pollen  is {{an important}} source of nitrogen for specialist flower-feeding mammals in Australia. However, its value for a generalist rodent species such as A. namaquensis had not previously been assessed. Casein is often used as the source of protein protein makes it easier for researchers to compare their results with those from other studies. The apparent digestibility of casein was significantly higher than that of pollen, 75. 6 % vs 58. 4 %, but the biological value was significantly lower, 39 % vs 49 %. As a result of the lower biological value the truly  digestible maintenance nitrogen requirements of A. namaquensis on the casein diet were almost double those on the pollen diet (158 mg N/day vs  66 mg N/day). When these values are compared with those <b>for</b> other <b>non-ruminants</b> on natural diets, the pollen values match those  predicted for a 60 g animal, while the casein values exceed the predictions. Because purified proteins, like casein, are unlikely to match an animal’s amino acid requirements closely, they may overestimate the nitrogen requirements of wild animals. </strong...|$|R
40|$|In Europe, {{ruminant}} {{processed animal proteins}} (PAPs) {{and blood}} products {{are not allowed to}} be used in feed for farmed animal. In contrast, blood meal and blood products of porcine origin are both authorised in aqua feed, whereas only porcine blood products are allowed to be used in feed intended <b>for</b> other <b>non-ruminants.</b> Besides official methods (light microscopy and PCR), complementary methods are developed in order to refine the by-products identification. By-products derived from blood are one of these products for which additional information are needed. Indeed, these prohibited materials sometimes cannot be distinguished from those authorised (e. g. milk powder) using official methods. The aim of this work was to develop a fast and easy method to detect blood meal and blood products. This study was based on the detection of hemoglobin in animal feed by synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS). To achieve this goal, preliminary tests were carried out on reference material (hemoglobin and albumin purchased from Sigma Aldrich) in order to determine appropriate conditions (solvent) and parameters (offset values) for hemoglobin detection. Selected settings were then applied to analyse protein extracts of commercial feed material derived from blood. The results obtained on blood meal and blood products (hemoglobin powder and plasma powder) showed fluorescence spectral bands that characterise hemoglobin. In order to determine whether the method was fit for the purpose, real commercial compound feeds known to contain or to be free from blood products or blood meal were analysed. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to these spectra showed {{that it was possible to}} discriminate samples containing hemoglobin from those that do not contain. This result confirmed that SFS is a promising screening method for the detection of hemoglobin in animal feed. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|China's future role in {{international}} agricultural trade {{continues to be}} a puzzle. Part of this puzzle, namely that related to grains, has received far more attention than has livestock trade, which has been relatively neglected. China is a net exporter of livestock products, although {{over the last two decades}} imports have been increasing faster than exports. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) projects that China will be a major net importer of poultry meat by 2005. In contrast, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) projects increase in China's net exports of poultry meat in the coming decades. Resolving this controversy requires examination of the forces underpinning changes in consumption patterns in China, as well as the structural changes that have been occuring in China's livestock industry. This paper illustrates China's net exports in non-ruminant meat production and forecasts to 2005; China's future trade in livestock products; non-ruminant production in China; cumulative productivity growth rates of pigs and poultry for China; and confidence intervals <b>for</b> China's 2005 <b>non-ruminant</b> trade balance due to uncertain productivity. The paper also discusses rising demand for livestock products; increase in supply; output gains and increased productivity; and increase in China's imports...|$|R
40|$|Phytic acid (PA) is {{the main}} {{phosphorus}} storage form in plant seeds. It is recognized as an anti-nutrient <b>for</b> humans and <b>non-ruminant</b> animals, {{as well as one}} of the major sources of phosphorus that contributes to eutrophication. Therefore, engineering plants with low PA content without affecting plant growth capacity has become a major focus in plant breeding. Nevertheless, lack of knowledge on the role of PA seed reserves in regulating plant growth and in maintaining ion homeostasis hinders such an agronomical application. In this context, we report here that the over-expression of the bacterial phytase PHY-US 417 in Arabidopsis leads to a significant decrease in seed PA, without any effect on the seed germination potential. Interestingly, this over-expression also induced a higher remobilization of free iron during germination. Moreover, the PHY-over-expressor lines show an increase in inorganic phosphate and sulfate contents, and a higher biomass production after phosphate starvation. Finally, phosphate sensing was altered because of the changes in the expression of genes induced by phosphate starvation or involved in phosphate or sulfate transport. Together, these results show that the over-expression of PHY-US 417 reduces PA concentration, and provide the first evidence for the involvement of PA in the regulation of sulfate and phosphate homeostasis and signaling...|$|R

A total of 22 N. cadamba and 35 L. leucocephala seedlings were analyzed to determine the mimosine content after 6 months of planting. It was noted that the mimosine content was highest in L. leucocephala (1. 6 %) and lowest in N. cadamba (0. 03 %) in comparison to M. sativa which has no mimosine content. Crude protein content was 23. 48 %, 20. 90 % and 14. 83 % for L. leucocephala, N. cadamba and M. sativa, respectively. The crude fiber was maximum in M. sativa (27. 23 %) and minimum in L. leucocephala (18. 77 %). Crude protein, crude fat, gross energy, protein to energy (P/E) ratio, organic matter and total ash in N. cadamba was higher compared to M. sativa. L. leucocephala was lower in nitrogen free extract, crude fiber and total ash compared to N. cadamba. Results from this study clearly indicate that N. cadamba has high forage quality and comparable to the traditional L. leucocephala and M. sativa as forage <b>for</b> ruminant and <b>non-ruminants...</b>|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing {{appreciation}} on the relevance of gastrointestinal microflora in both ruminants and non-ruminants owing to revelation of their role in several physiological func-tions including digestion, nutrient utilization, pathogen exclusion, gastrointestinal development, im-munity system, gut gene expression and quality of animal products. The ban imposed on the use of antibiotics and hormones in feed has compelled animal researchers in finding an alternative which could overcome the issues of conventional feed additives. Though the concept of prebiotic was evolved keeping in mind the gastrointestinal flora of human beings, presently animal researchers are exploring the efficiency of prebiotic (inulin) for modulating the gut ecosystem of both ruminants and non-ruminants. It was revealed that prebiotic inulin is found to exhibit desirable changes in the gut of non-ruminants like poultry, swine, rabbit etc for augmenting gut health and improvement of product quality. Similarly, in ruminants the prebiotic reduces rumen ammonia nitrogen, methane production, increase microbial protein synthesis and live weight gains in calves. Unlike other feed additives, prebiotic exhibits its effect in multipronged ways for overall increase in the performances of the ani-mals. In coming days, it is expected that prebiotics could be the part of diets in both ruminants and <b>non-ruminants</b> <b>for</b> enabling modulation of gut microflora vis a vis animals productivity in ecological ways.

40|$|Blood derived {{products}} are valuable animal products used in feed for their nutritional value and their {{positive effects on}} growth and health. Nevertheless, since the BSE crisis, their use is strictly regulated. Blood meal and blood products (hemoglobin powder and plasma powder) of bovine origin are totally prohibited. Blood meal and blood products of porcine origin are authorised in aquafeed, whereas only blood {{products are}} allowed {{to be used in}} feed intended <b>for</b> other <b>non-ruminant.</b> The detection of the type of protein and the species of origin is therefore crucial to ensure feed safety. With the current official methods for the detection of PAPs, light microscopy and PCR, it is not always possible to specifically identify this type of protein source. The objective of our work was to set-up a routine mass spectrometry method for a qualitative detection of blood meal and hemoglobin powder of bovine and porcine origin in feed. The method was based on the detection of species-specific peptides biomarkers identified in a previous study by a non-targeted approach. All biomarkers were peptides of α and β hemoglobin subunits. Proteins were extracted using a TCA/acetone protein precipitation protocol followed by purification with a 2 -D Clean-Up Kit (GE Healthcare, USA). After an in-solution trypsin digestion step, analyses were performed by liquid chromatography (Acquity system, Waters, UK) coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Xevo TQS, Waters, UK) with electrospray ionisation. The acquisition and processing of data was carried out by MassLynx software (v. 4. 1, Waters) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) design was made using the open-source software Skyline ([URL] Reference hemoglobin powder was used to select MRM transitions for each peptide biomarkers and to optimise their collision energy. Commercial feed material and compound feed containing or free from blood derived products were then analysed. Selected transitions were present in materials or feed known to contained blood derived product of the same origin and absent in the others. Artificially contaminated feed with various contamination levels were also analysed in order to evaluate the influence of matrix composition and to experimentally determine the limit of detection. A first estimation of the LOD was around 0. 05 % w/w which was below the LOD imposed by the EC for animal proteins detection method. Peer reviewe...|$|R
