40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} shape of the utility {{function}} <b>for</b> <b>losses.</b> From a rational point of view {{it can be argued that}} utility should be concave. Empirically measurements of the utility <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> show mixed results but most evidence supports convex rather than concave utilities. However, these measurements use methods that are either biased by the certainty effect or require complex parametrical estimations. This paper re-examines utility <b>for</b> <b>losses,</b> avoiding the mentioned pitfalls by using the tradeoff method. We find that utility <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> is convex. This is contrary to common assumption in the economics literature. Also, we investigate properties of the tradeoff method showing a new violation of procedure invariance. Our findings demonstrate that diminishing sensitivity is an important phenomenon for utility elicitation...|$|R

5|$|The two teams' {{defenses}} {{also performed}} statistically well during the game. Cincinnati's Terrill Byrd led all defenders by recording 11 tackles during the game.
