25|$|This glossy all-black crow has a {{heavy black}} bill with an arching culmen (upper {{edge of the}} mandible) and has a fine tip. The {{feathers}} have a purple gloss throughout. The tail of the Indian jungle crow is rounded and the legs and feet are stout. The Himalayan japonensis (in this sense including western intermedius and eastern tibetosinensis) has a slightly wedge-shaped tail and a voice is a guttural and grating graak (intermedius) or a hoarse kyarrh (tibetosinensis). The calls of the Indian jungle crow are not unlike that of the <b>house</b> <b>crow</b> but are harsher. In Sri Lanka, the <b>house</b> <b>crow</b> lacks the light grey neck but the neck is slimmer than in the jungle crow. The sexes are indistinguishable.|$|E
25|$|The {{breeding}} season is mainly March–April in northern India and earlier in south India. In Sri Lanka {{it is from}} May to July. The nest is a platform of twigs placed in a large tree and very rarely on buildings. The centre of the nest is neatly lined with hair, coir or other fine fibre. The usual clutch is three to five pale blue-green eggs speckled with brown. The eggs hatch after about 17–19 days and the young fledge in about a month. The nests are sometimes parasitized by the Asian koel although not as frequently as the <b>house</b> <b>crow.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Vedas {{represent}} some of {{the oldest}} historical records available (1500 – 500 BC) and they list the names of nearly 250 kinds of birds besides many other notes on various other fauna and flora. In the vedic texts, Aryavarta, {{the land of the}} Aryans, was considered to be co-terminous with the range of the blackbuck. Sometimes, these referred to the lands North of the Vindhyas; at others times, it included lands to the South. A notable piece of information mentioned in the Vedas is the knowledge of brood parasitism in the Indian koel, a habit known well ahead of Aristotle (384 – 322 BC). This is possibly because both the Indian koel and its host the <b>house</b> <b>crow</b> were common and easy to observe.|$|E

50|$|<b>House</b> <b>crows</b> feed {{largely on}} refuse around human habitations, small {{reptiles}} and mammals, {{and other animals}} such as insects and other small invertebrates, eggs, nestlings, grain and fruits. <b>House</b> <b>crows</b> have also been observed swooping down from the air and snatching baby squirrels. Most food is taken from the ground, but also from trees as opportunity arises. They are highly opportunistic birds and given their omnivorous diet, they can survive on nearly anything that is edible. These birds can be seen near marketplaces and garbage dumps, foraging for scraps. They have also been observed to eat sand after feeding on carcasses.|$|R

2500|$|The Indian jungle crow (Corvus culminatus) is {{a species}} of crow found across the Indian Subcontinent south of the Himalayas. It is very common and readily {{distinguished}} from the <b>house</b> <b>crow</b> which has a grey neck. In the past the species {{was treated as a}} subspecies of an other crow species but vocalizations and evidence from ectoparasite co-evolution and phylogenetic evidence have led to it being considered as a distinct species in modern taxonomic treatments. It differs in its voice from the large-billed crow found in the higher elevations of the Himalayas and the eastern jungle crow (Corvus levaillantii) overlaps {{in the eastern part of}} its range. In appearance it can be difficult to distinguish from either of these species although the plumage tends to be more uniformly glossed in purple and has a longer bill with a fine tip and an arched culmen. The Himalayan species has a slightly wedge-shaped tailunlike the rounded tail of the Indian jungle crow and tends to glide a lot [...]|$|E

50|$|The Asian koel is a brood parasite, {{and lays}} its single egg in the nests {{of a variety}} of birds, {{including}} the jungle crow, and <b>house</b> <b>crow.</b> In Sri Lanka before 1880 it was only known to parasitize the jungle crow, later shifting to the <b>house</b> <b>crow.</b> A study in India found 5% of Corvus splendens and 0.5% of Corvus macrorhynchos nests parasitized.|$|E
50|$|At {{least some}} {{trees in the}} local {{environment}} seem to be necessary for successful breeding although <b>house</b> <b>crows</b> occasionally nest on telephone towers. It lays 3-5 eggs in a typical stick nest, and occasionally there are several nests in the same tree. In South Asia they are parasitized by the Asian koel. Peak breeding in India as well as Peninsular Malaysia is from April to July. Large trees with big crowns are preferred for nesting.|$|R
