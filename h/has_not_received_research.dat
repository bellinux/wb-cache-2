40|$|Online {{education}} {{differs from}} traditional education {{in that it}} includes a variety of formats: asynchronous web-based instruction, bulletin board discussion, e-mail communication, as well as synchronous online chat and net conferencing (Kearsley, 2000). Indeed, the recent rapid development of educational technology has positively influenced many aspects of education at all levels directly or indirectly (CEO Forum, 2000; Muffoletto, 1990; Troxel & Grady, 1989). Recent research involving online education has emphasized the learners ’ achievement and course evaluation (Kearsley, 2000; Russell, 1999). However, the effects of online instruction on learners ’ psychological factors, such as achievement motivation and locus of control, <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> <b>research</b> attention. Given the rapid development of instructional technology as well as support for the instructional efficacy of technological interventions, {{it is important to}} examine the effects of intervention on individual difference variables. There are two major objectives in this study. The first one is to investigate how the online instruction in a graduate instructional technology course affects the learners ’ psychological factors, such as locus of control (LOC) and achievement motivation.

40|$|A type of {{emergency}} decision-making which <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> <b>research</b> attention is the police {{search for a}} lost person in a rural or wilderness area. For many such incidents, decisions concerning where {{to search for the}} lost subject are made by a planning team, each member of which assigns probabilities to the various hypotheses about where the subject might be located, including the residual hypothesis that the subject is somewhere else entirely, that is, outside of the designated search area. In the current study, 32 adult males with search planning experience were asked to assign probabilities to a fictional lost person incident. It was hypothesized, according to support theory (Tversky and Koehler, 1994), that subjects who first considered the five possible scenarios accounting for how the subject could have left the search area [...] i. e., unpacked the residual hypothesis [...] would subsequently increase their probability estimate of the global hypothesis that the missing subject was NOT in the designated search area, compared to those subjects who unpacked the focal hypothesis. This hypothesis was confirmed. We also found considerable evidence for SUBADDITIVITY, as most subjects estimated higher summed probabilities for the individual scenarios accounting for the focal and residual hypotheses, respectively. The potential negative consequences of such unpacking effects during a lost person incident were discussed, and possible means of mitigating such effects were described...|$|E
40|$|Infrared {{thermography}} (IRT) {{has matured}} {{and is now}} widely accepted as a condition monitoring tool where temperature is measured in a non-contact way. Since the late 1970 s, it has been extensively used in vibrothermography (Sonic IR) non-destructive technique {{for the evaluation of}} surface cracks through the observation of thermal imaging of the vibration-induced crack heat generation. However, it <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> <b>research</b> attention on prediction of structural vibration behaviour, hence; the concept to date is not understood. Therefore, this paper explores its ability to fill the existing knowledge gap. To achieve this, two cantilever beam-like structures couple with a friction rod subjected to a forced excitations while infrared cameras capturing the thermal images on the friction interfaces. The analysed frictional temperature evolution using the Matlab Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm {{and the use of the}} heat conduction equation in conjunction with a finite difference approach successfully identifies the structural vibration characteristics; with maximum error of 0. 28 % and 20. 71 % for frequencies and displacements, respectively. These findings are particularly useful in overcoming many limitations inherent in some of the current vibration measuring techniques applied in structural integrity management such as strain gauge failures due to fatigue.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare Motivational Interviewing (MI) as an {{intervention}} that differed from other best practice interviewing techniques in that it increased the level of Commitment Language (CL) expressed by clients. Clients with spinal cord injury (SCI) were selected for this study because the use of MI with acute onset disabilities <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> <b>research</b> attention. It was proposed that Motivational Interviewing increased CL expressed in utterances from clients that identified intrinsic motivators or alternatively possible barriers to engage in the rehabilitation process. The level of CL was seen as a predictor of the client’s motivation towards rehabilitation initiatives and identified behavioural change towards adherence to rehabilitation or barriers preventing adherence. The increase in CL depends on the interviewing process. How CL is expressed in interviews depends on the interviewer’s ability to recognise positive or negative direction in the client’s response. The ability to measure CL may assist in identifying what it is that MI does in the interviewing process to increase CL. Elevated levels of CL recorded in interviews may be defined as low, medium or high and either positive or negative. The key elements of this study are whether MI increases the level of CL expressed by clients compared with base line best practice strength based assessment questioning (SBAQ). Recognising MI as an intervention to increase CL may assist clients in engaging or adhering to rehabilitation initiatives. The use of conversational analysis (CA) indicates that CL is a measurable component of MI that differentiates it from other interviewing techniques. Further research is required to promote CL as a predictor of behaviour change. Identifying the integrity of MI principles in studies that can show the relationship of MI to outcomes and compare these with recognised alternative treatments is required to enhance the delivery of the intervention...|$|E
40|$|Principal Topic Counties in Northern Europe, such as Sweden, Finland and Denmark, have {{comparatively}} low {{per capita}} rates of entrepreneurship {{as measured by}} independent new venture start-up rates – as for example measured by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) Total entrepreneurial activity (TEA) rate. However, the latest 2011 GEM data reveals that these same countries have comparatively very high Employee Entrepreneurship Activity (EEA) rates – that is a high rate per capita of employees involved in new product development or new enterprise activities. This observation has prompted us to investigate the role of national culture in driving independent versus employee entrepreneurial activities. Prior research has established that national (and regional) culture {{plays an important role}} in forming an “entrepreneurial culture” that encourages (or discourages) independent business start-ups and TEA (e. g. Davidsson, 1995; Beugelsdijk, 2007). However, the relationship of culture and EEA <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> <b>research</b> attention. Moreover, empirical relationships between elements of national culture and independent entrepreneurship have revealed some surprising results. For example, Wildeman et al. (1999) report an unexpected higher share of individual business ownership in countries that have higher uncertainty avoidance, higher power distance and lower individualism according to Hofstede’s dimensions of culture. They speculate that dissatisfaction can be a source of entrepreneurship: in countries with a high power distance, a high uncertainty avoidance and low individualism, there may be relatively more business owners since enterprising individuals cannot satisfy their needs within existing organizations. Yet it remains a rather open question whether entrepreneurial behaviour in existing organisations provides a satisfactory explanation for these empirical findings. Methods We will conduct a cross sectional study of the influence of national culture according to the five / six dimensions of Hofstede (1980; 2001) on both TEA and EEA for the 54 countries that participated in GEM 2011. Since it is well established that the opportunities for entrepreneurship vary substantially with a country’s level of economic development, we intend to conduct separate analyses for the three categories of development – innovation driven economies, efficient driven economies and factor driven economies. We also intend to restrict our assessment of TEA to opportunity driven entrepreneurship, as necessity driven entrepreneurship has a different relationship to the “entrepreneurial culture” that is the focus of our study. We will control for a range of factors such as GDP growth, ease of doing business index and unemployment. Results and Implications Descriptive analyses of the GEM TEA and EEA data reveal clusters of countries that appear to be have similar national culture. We are yet to conduct regression analyses...|$|E

40|$|Extensive {{research}} suggests {{that a number of}} plant-derived chemicals and traditional Oriental herbal remedies possess cognition-enhancing properties. Widely used current treatments for dementia include extracts of Ginkgo biloba and several alkaloidal, and therefore toxic, plant-derived cholinergic agents. Several non-toxic, European herbal species have pan-cultural traditions as treatments for cognitive deficits, including those associated with ageing. To date they <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> <b>research</b> interest commensurate with their potential utility. Particularly promising candidate species include sage (Salvia lavandulaefolia/officinalis), Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) and rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis). In the case of sage, extracts possess anti-oxidant, estrogenic, and antiinflammatory properties, and specifically inhibit butyryl- and acetyl-cholinesterase. Acute administration has also been found to reliably improve mnemonic performance in healthy young and elderly cohorts, whilst a chronic regime has been shown to attenuate cognitive declines in sufferers from Alzheimer's disease. In the case of Melissa officinalis, extracts have, most notably, been shown to bind directly to both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in human brain tissue. This property has been shown to vary with extraction method and strain. Robust anxiolytic effects have also been demonstrated following acute administration to healthy humans, with mnemonic enhancement restricted to an extract with high cholinergic binding properties. Chronic regimes of aromatherapy and essential oil respectively have also been shown to reduce agitation and attenuate cognitive declines in sufferers from dementia. Given the side effect profile of prescribed cholinesterase inhibitors, and a current lack of a well tolerated nicotinic receptor agonist, these herbal treatments may well provide effective and well-tolerated treatments for dementia, either alone, in combination, or as an adjunct to conventional treatments...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach It is based on 14 cases of which four are discussed in detail. All 14 cases are summarized in two tables and analyzed in the Discussion section. Findings Most firms did not pre-plan their foreign activities. International wine tourism was a major source for creating the contacts necessary for their internationalization: they created relationships/networks in tourists’ home markets and, as a result, expanded there either through selling directly to tourists or to the importers they recommended. In addition, they relied on contacts created at trade fairs or by friends/relatives. Some internationalization attempts failed, as the firms were passive and lacked long-term strategic plans. Thus, these producers <b>have</b> <b>not</b> fully realized the potential of wine tourists’ contacts and other network relationships in their internationalization.

This study further examines limb load asymmetries during quiet bipedal stance. During voluntary frontal-plane weight shifting for 2 min, 300 centre-of-pressure displacements on 14 blindfolded right-handed young adults were recorded. Four biomechanical indices were used to assess postural behaviour. These were the bias of time and the magnitude of the partial ground reaction forces from both legs, and the bias in the number and magnitude of microshifts influencing stability. Our study identifies a significant level of asymmetry in the quiet bipedal stance of right-handed people. This asymmetry is associated with the right-sided bias of the ground reaction force and the angle of inclination to the upright (vertical) centroidal line. We found that the initial lateralisation of the partial ground reaction forces from both feet, as well as the period of ground reaction force bias, are important elements in any clinical tests involving quiet bipedal stance. </p...|$|R

When leaves were harvested, seed yield was reduced on average by 57 % and 59 %, on-station and on-farm, respectively, with large variation among treatments. The local landrace check had the highest leaf yields on-farm where it produced a mean of 25 g/plant/ 2 -weekly harvesting interval. It also conveyed positive mixture effects; however, yield stability across successive harvests was lowest, indicating its capacity to react to positive environmental changes. Some mixtures of more than two cultivars maintained more leaf yield stability over time across successive leaf harvests. The highest positive relative mixture effects on leaf and seed yields of up to 100 % and 193 %, respectively, were obtained in two-way mixtures, indicating that these may offer the best combinations for improved yields and to screen for favorable and unfavorable cultivar components.

40|$|The {{importance}} of institutional trust and its key determinants {{have been widely}} acknowledged in developed countries. However, in developing countries, where institutional trust <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been well established, its structural causes <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> adequate <b>research</b> emphasis. The aims of our study are: (1) to examine the direct effect of civic engagement on institutional trust; and (2) to examine the mediating effects of government dysfunction and government performance {{on the relationship between}} civic engagement and institutional trust. We conducted a structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis using data from the 2004 Afrobarometer Round 2. 5 survey in South Africa (N = 2, 400). We found a positive direct effect of civic engagement on institutional trust and indirect effects of civic engagement on institutional trust, mediated by government dysfunction and government performance, both individually and sequentially. Findings suggest that {{the development and implementation of}} policies enhancing civic engagement and good governance are needed to increase institutional trust. South Africa, a country with over 20 years of democracy, is on the path to enhancing civic engagement and building institutional trust. These goals can be achieved through building a society in which government is based on democratic values and civil society...|$|R
40|$|A {{chronic illness}} like {{schizophrenia}} seriously disrupts family functioning {{in various ways}} that can be addressed through family psychoeducational interventions in routine clinical services, an approach that <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> proper <b>research</b> attention. We pre- and post-tested four sets of parents of individuals with schizophrenia who participated in a long-term group psychoeducational intervention (treatment group) and four sets of parents of individuals with schizophrenia who received standard outpatient services (clinical control group), using three self-reported questionnaires to measure family functioning (Family Assessment Device), family atmosphere (Family Rituals Scale), and family burden (Family Burden Scale). At pre-test, there were no systematic {{differences between the two}} groups in any of the parameters assessed. At post-test, within and across groups, comparisons revealed significant improvements (under cut-off scores) in the mean scores of the treatment group (p < 0. 05) in all three parameters under study. Our findings provide pilot evidence that intensive group parent psychoeducation is an efficient and efficacious treatment intervention for improvement of systemic properties of families, such as family functioning, family atmosphere, and family burden. © 2015 Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|Dried fruits {{consumption}} <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> much <b>research</b> attention, {{although these}} foods {{are associated with}} potential health benefits. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to compare fresh fruits and dried fruits on measures of health, convenience and consumer feelings. An on-line questionnaire that measured consumers' perceptions of the health benefits and convenience characteristics and their feelings about the consumption of both fresh fruits (apples and plums) and dried fruits (e. g., raisins, dates, and apricots) was completed by 693 respondents (Polish, French, and Dutch). Generally, fresh fruits were perceived to be healthier and less convenient than dried fruits. Consumers also reported more positive feelings about the consumption of fresh fruits compared to dried fruits. The more that the respondents were willing to sacrifice for their health, the more positively they rated the health aspects of both fresh and dried fruits, as well as several perceptions of convenience of both fresh and dried fruits. Health preoccupation was unrelated to most of the convenience perceptions and was associated with lower scores on several perceptions of healthiness. Recommendations for the consumer-oriented development of dried fruits are also provided...|$|R
40|$|In {{their quest}} to manage the {{complexity}} of offering greater product variety, firms in many industries are considering platform-based product development. Product platforms, which are component and subsystem assets shared across a product-family, enable a firm to better leverage investments in product design and development. While the platform approach offers a number of benefits, it also imposes certain additional costs that <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> adequate <b>research</b> attention. In this paper, we use an industrial example both to illustrate some of {{the costs and benefits}} of platform-based product development and to motivate the development of a mathematical model. The model is formulated to better understand the appropriateness of product platforms and their impact on product-planning decisions. Our results indicate that platforms are not appropriate for extreme levels of market diversity or high levels of nonplatform scale economies. Also, a firm's product positioning and introduction sequence decisions made during the product-planning phase are significantly impacted by the presence of platforms. Specifically, a platform increases the separation among products and offers a multitude of product introduction strategies. We translate our model findings into a managerial framework.
