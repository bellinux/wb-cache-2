5|$|Offshore {{volcanism}} also {{occurs in}} Chile. Intraplate volcanism {{generated from the}} Easter and Juan Fernández hotspots <b>has</b> <b>formed</b> many Chilean islands, including Isla Salas y Gómez, Easter Island, and the Juan Fernández Islands.

5|$|Taftan {{is part of}} a {{volcanic}} arc in Iran, together with Bazman, also in Iran, and Koh-i-Sultan in Pakistan. This volcanic arc <b>has</b> <b>formed</b> on Cretaceous-Eocene sedimentary layers and has resulted from the subduction of the oceanic Arabian plate beneath Iran at the Makran trench.|$|E
5|$|A {{footbridge}} {{is incorporated}} {{on the eastern}} side and pedestrians, cyclists and motorcycles can cross the estuary {{by the side of the}} track. Since 1996, this <b>has</b> <b>formed</b> part of the National Cycle Route that links North and South Wales. The footbridge is owned by Network Rail but an agreement is in place with Gwynedd County Council, who pay for 10% of the annual maintenance in exchange for a licence to use the bridge.|$|E

25|$|The moons of Saturn are {{typically}} thought to <b>have</b> <b>formed</b> through co-accretion, {{a similar process}} to that believed to <b>have</b> <b>formed</b> the planets in the Solar System. As the young gas giants formed, they were surrounded by discs of material that gradually coalesced into moons. However, a proposed model on the formation of Titan suggests that Titan was instead formed {{in a series of}} giant impacts between pre-existing moons. Iapetus and Rhea are thought to <b>have</b> <b>formed</b> from part of the debris of these collisions. More-recent studies, however, suggest that all of Saturn's moons inward of Titan are no more than 100 million years old; thus, Iapetus is unlikely to <b>have</b> <b>formed</b> in the same series of collisions as Rhea and all the other moons inward of Titan, and—along with Titan—may be a primordial satellite.|$|R
5|$|A {{red cross}} {{was a symbol}} for many Crusaders in the 12th and 13th centuries. It became {{associated}} with Saint George, along with countries and cities, which claimed him as their patron saint and used his cross as a banner. Since 1606 the St George's Cross <b>has</b> <b>formed</b> part of {{the design of the}} Union Flag, a Pan-British flag designed by King James I.|$|E
5|$|Cott's {{textbook}} {{was at once}} well received, being admired both by zoologists and naturalists {{and among}} allied soldiers. Many officers carried {{a copy of the}} book with them in the field. Since the war it <b>has</b> <b>formed</b> the basis for experimental investigation of camouflage, while its breadth of coverage and accuracy have ensured that it remains frequently cited in scientific papers.|$|E
5|$|Government, military, {{and private}} {{customers}} have acquired the 757 for uses ranging from aeronautical testing and research to cargo and VIP transport. The 757-200, {{the most widely}} ordered version of the aircraft, <b>has</b> <b>formed</b> the basis for these applications. The first government operator of the 757 was the Mexican Air Force, which took delivery of a VIP-configured 757-200 in November 1987.|$|E

5|$|In {{osteochondritis}} dissecans, {{fragments of}} cartilage or bone become loose within a joint, leading to pain and inflammation. These fragments are {{sometimes referred to}} as joint mice. OCD is a type of osteochondrosis in which a lesion <b>has</b> <b>formed</b> within the cartilage layer itself, giving rise to secondary inflammation. OCD most commonly affects the knee, although it can affect other joints such as the ankle or the elbow.|$|E
5|$|In some serpins, the S to R {{transition}} can activate {{cell signalling}} events. In these cases, a serpin that <b>has</b> <b>formed</b> a complex with its target protease, is then recognised by a receptor. The binding event then leads to downstream signalling by the receptor. The S to R transition is therefore used to alert cells {{to the presence}} of protease activity. This differs from the usual mechanism whereby serpins affect signalling simply by inhibiting proteases involved in a signalling cascade.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{photometric}} and spectroscopic {{observations from}} 2005 to 2007 {{indicate that a}} new disk <b>has</b> <b>formed</b> around the equatorthus constituting a double disk phenomenon with disks at different angles. The inclination angle of the new disk is estimated at 60° whereas the previous disk was inclined at around 30°. Such a misaligned double-disk structure has never been observed before among Be stars. Thus, Pleione provides {{a rare opportunity to}} investigate the forming process of a new disk and the consequent interaction between the two.|$|E

5|$|The South Atlantic Ocean is {{generally}} inhospitable {{to the formation}} of a tropical storm. Although rare, a growing number of subtropical cyclones have developed in the South Atlantic Ocean near Brazil, such as the unofficially-named Hurricane Catarina of 2004 that made landfall as a Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Since 2011, certain storms have official names, such as Subtropical Storm Arani. At least one storm <b>has</b> <b>formed</b> near the West Coast of Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{arms are}} used as a mark of {{authority}} by various government agencies and representatives, including the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Speaker of the House of Commons, most courts (including the Supreme Court), and, formerly, Parliament, and {{on the cover of}} Canadian passports. Since 1962, a banner of the arms, defaced with a variant of the Queen's cypher, <b>has</b> <b>formed</b> the Royal Standard of Canada, for use by the Canadian sovereign. The personal flag of the Governor General has featured the crest of the arms of Canada on a blue background since 1981.|$|E

5|$|The low-lying damp ground {{can produce}} a visual effect known as a Fata Morgana when the Tor appears to rise out of the mist. This optical {{phenomenon}} occurs because rays of light are strongly bent when they pass through air layers of different temperatures in a steep thermal inversion where an atmospheric duct <b>has</b> <b>formed.</b> The Italian term Fata Morgana {{is derived from the}} name of Morgan le Fay, a powerful sorceress in Arthurian legend.|$|E
