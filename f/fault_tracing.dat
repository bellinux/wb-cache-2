A promising diagnostic condition control technique for the high-voltage oil-filled electrical facilities is the method of positioning partial discharges (PDs) and their intense measuring. The paper provides outcome of experiments enabling acoustic PD positioning at the transformers of the power plant units.

Yet a significant proportion of them have severe quality problems. To address this issue, our previous work presented an interval-based testing methodology for spreadsheets.

40|$|Abstract — The {{importance}} of the routers in the network and the vulnerability {{in the nature of}} the link state routing protocol highlight the necessity of effective routing protection against variant attacks. One of the severe attacks is from the faulty intermediate router (FIR) which intentionally compromises the LSA messages passing by and pollutes the routing tables of its downstream routers. Current security mechanisms are either too expensive or vulnerable to prevent this type of inside attack. To address the FIR attack, in this paper, we present a novel costreduced integrated solution which combines both fault-detection operations from routers and fault-tracing response from network management components. The significant properties of our system are the detectability of the abnormal behavior toward the LSAs and the traceability of the FIRs generating those bogus LSAs. The analysis of the memory requirement and the communication cost in our design demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our system.

40|$|In the Coris and Guarco valleys, we {{conducted}} geomorphic and geophysical studies and compiled geo-logical, hydrogeological and trench information {{in order to}} define the traces of the Aguacaliente fault. The principal active <b>trace</b> of this <b>fault</b> trends west-northwest and {{is located in the}} southern sector of the Coris and El Guarco valleys. Rivers and creeks bending between 50 and 450 m suggest it is a sinistral fault. The location of the <b>fault</b> <b>trace</b> is well constrained in certain parts of both valleys; elsewhere the <b>fault</b> <b>trace</b> is inferred using geomorphic criteria. The <b>fault</b> <b>trace</b> shows a wide deformation zone that covers between tens of meters to more than hundred meters. The lack of fault prominence and the wide fault zone are explained by the combination of a horizontal displacement fault traversing a topographically flat region with a Quaternary sedimentary fill, poorly consolidated in its upper portion, and erosion and sedimentation rates that are greater than the rate of seismic activity along the fault. A second west-northwest <b>fault</b> <b>trace</b> is defined along the northern border of the Coris valley on the boundary of the Carpintera hills.

40|$|The thesis delves {{into the}} area of {{troubleshooting}} procedures, an interesting areafor industry. Many products in industry tend to be complex, which in turn makestroubleshooting procedures trickier. A fast and efficient repair process is oftendesired, since customers want the product to be repaired as fast as possible. The purpose of a troubleshooting procedure {{is to find a}} fault in a broken product,and to choose proper repair actions in a workshop. Such a procedure can besimplified by diagnosis tools, for example software programs that make faultconclusions based on fault codes. These tools can make such conclusions withthe help of algorithms, i. e. <b>fault</b> <b>tracing</b> algorithms. Before a product release, it is hard to specify all faults and connections in the system. New unknown fault cases are likely to arise after release, and somehow thisneed {{to be taken into account}} in the troubleshooting scenario. The troubleshootingprocedure can be made more robust, if new data could be easily incorporatedin the current structure. This work seek to answer how new data can be incorporatedin trouble shooting procedures. A good and reliable <b>fault</b> <b>tracing</b> algorithm is essential in the process of findingfaults and repair actions, which is the reason behind the focus of this thesis. Thepresented problem asks how a fault can be identified from fault codes and symptoms,in order to recommend suitable repair actions. Therefore, the problem isdivided into two parts, finding the fault and recommending repair actions. Inthe first part, three candidate algorithms for finding the faults are investigated,namely Bayesian networks, neural networks, and a method called matrix correlationinspired from latent semantic indexing. The investigation is done by trainingeach algorithm with data, and evaluating the results. The second part consists ofone method proposal for repair action recommendations and one example. Thetheoretical investigation is based on the Servo unit steering (SUS), which residein the IPS system of Volvo Penta. The primary contribution of the thesis is the evaluation of three different algorithmsand a proposal of one strategy to recommend suitable repair actions. In this study Bayesian networks are found to conform well with the desired attributes,which in turn lead to the conclusion that Bayesian networks is well suited for this problem...|$|E

40|$|High-resolution seismic {{images were}} {{developed}} using both seismic refraction and reflection profiling from coincident P- and S-wave seismic data acquired near Woodside, California, in June 2012. A 60 -m-long seismic profile was approximately {{centered on the}} 1906 surface rupture of the Peninsula segment of the San Andreas Fault (SAF). The data were acquired and processed with methods previously used by the U. S. Geological Survey in other successful studies. The seismic images suggest the presence of possibly three near-surface <b>fault</b> <b>traces</b> within about 25 m of the main 1906 surface rupture. A Pwave, high-velocity zone relates to a significant <b>fault</b> <b>trace</b> observed southwest of the main 1906 <b>fault</b> <b>trace</b> that {{does not appear to}} break the surface. This trace may be associated with long-term movement prior to the main 1906 break, and the <b>fault</b> <b>traces</b> observed may merge at depth. The reflection image displays strong, near-vertical diffractions, particularly beneath the P-wave, high-velocity zone, consistent with <b>fault</b> <b>traces</b> inferred from the seismic images. A borehole augered into this P-wave, highvelocity zone revealed bright blue clay, possibly originating from weathered serpentinite. Because this study found evidence for multiple <b>fault</b> <b>traces</b> in the SAF zone, it is possible that slip histories for the Peninsula segment of the SAF may have been miscalculated. Further work in geophysics and especially paleoseismology is needed to better constrain the geometry and slip history of the Peninsula segment of the SAF...|$|R

Currently, at Volvo Bus Corporation, {{there are two main}} methods to do <b>fault</b> <b>tracing</b> on the body, but there is no guided diagnostics, which means if something wrong happens, we can get a warning but we have no idea how to locate the error component efficiently, the diagnosis work depends largely on the expert’s experience. In this thesis, the front door system of a Volvo bus is chosen to be a target system to try the model-based diagnosis method. The system is modeled with a model-based reasoning software called RODON. With the help of the tool, the model can be created, modified and simulated. Based on the model, the corresponding database can be generated automatically after some constraints are set, then we can generate the decision tree based on the database, that is what we expect from the model. And {{with the help of the}} decision tree, the mechanics can be guided to the right direction to find out the erroneous component precisely and efficiently.

40|$|The {{presence}} of active <b>fault</b> <b>traces</b> in proximity to any new infrastructure {{project is a}} major concern for the design process. The relative displacements that can be experienced in surface fault rupture during a seismic event must be either entirely avoided or mitigated in some way. Blind faults present a significant challenge to engineers attempting to identify these hazards. Current standards of practice employed to locate these features are time consuming and costly. This work investigates the geophysical methods of refraction microtremor (ReMi) and seismic refraction with regard to their applicability in this task. By imaging a distinct lateral variation in the shear wave velocity (Vs) profile across a short horizontal distance, these methods may provide a means of constraining traditional investigation techniques to a more focused area. The ReMi method is still very new, but holds key advantages over other geophysical methods in its ease of application and ability to achieve good results in highly urban settings. It {{is one of the few}} geophysical techniques that does not suffer in the {{presence of}} high amplitude ambient vibrations. The seismic refraction method is here applied in an attempt to corroborate data obtained through the ReMi analysis procedure. Sensitivity, precision parametric studies are carried out in order to learn how to best apply the ReMi method. Both tests are then applied at a previously trenched <b>fault</b> <b>trace</b> to determine whether the data can be matched to the subsurface information. Finally, the methods are deployed at a location with an inferred <b>fault</b> <b>trace</b> where little to nothing is known about the subsurface. The precision study indicates a coefficient of variation for the ReMi method on the order of 7 %. At the known <b>fault</b> <b>trace</b> both methods generally agree qualitatively with available subsurface data and each other. Using the ReMi method, a marked shift is observed in the Vs profile laterally across the <b>fault</b> <b>trace.</b> In the case of the inferred <b>fault</b> <b>trace,</b> the same type of lateral variation in the V­­s profile is observed using the ReMi method. The seismic refraction at this site does not agree with the ReMi data, but seems reasonable given the visible geomorphology. Receiver arrays placed in close proximity to the inferred <b>fault</b> <b>trace</b> recorded erratic signals during seismic refraction testing, and displayed abnormal response modes after transforming the ReMi data to frequency-slowness space. These anomalies may possibly be attributed to the presence of abnormal subsurface structural geometry indicative of faulting...|$|R
40|$|International audienceI use GPS interseismic {{velocities}} {{and classic}} 2 D elastic half-space models with a screw dislocation {{to estimate the}} long-term fault slip rate, locking depth, and the offset between the surface <b>fault</b> <b>trace</b> {{and the location of}} the dislocation below the seismogenic zone for 13 segments along 8 major strike-slip faults. Using deduced strike-slip rates and the position of the dislocation to normalize the interseismic velocities to facilitate comparison of spatial patterns of deformation, I show that no substantial differences can be detected, ruling out a large asymmetry in interseismic velocities across the 8 faults used in this study. Only the Carrizo Plain segment of the San Andreas Fault shows a significant asymmetry that cannot be explained by shifting the position of the dislocation at depth relative to the <b>fault</b> <b>trace.</b> However, the resulting perturbation is less than 10 % of total strike-slip rate. <b>Fault</b> <b>traces</b> are usually curved, defining a concave side. When the dislocation at depth is significantly offset from the <b>fault</b> <b>trace,</b> the shift is always toward the block on the concave side of the <b>fault</b> <b>trace.</b> This suggests that the fault zone in the lower crust may develop a simpler geometry more consistent with relative motion across the fault than its upper seismogenic part constrained by the structural complexity of the brittle crust. Since the faults used in this study are at different times in their interseismic period, comparing the interseismic velocity fields across them allows identification of possible variations of the interseismic velocities with time. When normalized by slip rate and dislocation location, all the faults show the same interseismic strain with no significant differences between deduced locking depths. These comparisons suggest that if temporal variations occur as suggested by some dynamic earthquake cycle models, they are small and below the accuracy of the available geodetic measurements...|$|R
