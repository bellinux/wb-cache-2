40|$|The article {{considers}} {{reasons for}} radical mass <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> protest {{in the context}} of the ‘Malthusian trap’ and structural-demographic theory of Jack Goldstone, which have become popular in the last two decades. The author critically evaluates these two conceptions and comes to the conclusion that the principles they underline are just concomitant factors, i. e. additional risk factors for political systems and regimes, rather than causes <b>of</b> radical mass <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> protest. The author suggests a method of analysis that consists of studying the circumstances, i. e. the wide historical context, in which mass <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> protest usually emerge, and provides a large number of illustrative examples. The scientific approach to the identification of social-historical determinants <b>of</b> radical <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> protest implies that if something is a reason/cause of an event, then this reason/cause must be present whenever there is such an event both alone or within a complex of concomitant factors. The ‘Malthusian trap’ and demographic factors cannot be traced in all manifestations <b>of</b> radical mass <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> protest in modern and contemporary history. Moreover, the ‘Malthusian trap’ and demographic pressure on the economy and social system do not always lead to mass <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> protest. The wave <b>of</b> radical <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> protest in the last decade, i. e. the so-called ‘color revolutions’, ‘Arab spring’, protest actions in France, England and the USA, once again confirms the relevance of the author’s approach and the importance of critical study of the traditional conceptions...|$|R

5|$|Principal {{evidence}} of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social behaviors that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage in some <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> interaction before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed {{over a period of}} time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> organisation in {{the area}} was the clan (ubwoko). The clans were not limited to genealogical lineages or geographical area, and most included Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa. From the 15th century, the clans began to coalesce into kingdoms; by 1700 around eight kingdoms existed in present-day Rwanda. One of these, the Kingdom of Rwanda, ruled by the Tutsi Nyiginya clan, became increasingly dominant from the mid-eighteenth century. The kingdom reached its greatest extent {{during the nineteenth century}} under the reign of King Kigeli Rwabugiri. Rwabugiri conquered several smaller states, expanded the kingdom west and north, and initiated administrative reforms; these included ubuhake, in which Tutsi patrons ceded cattle, and therefore privileged status, to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service, and uburetwa, a corvée system in which Hutu were forced to work for Tutsi chiefs. Rwabugiri's changes caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations. The Twa were better off than in pre-Kingdom days, with some becoming dancers in the royal court, but their numbers continued to decline.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} of all dance {{in a large}} country such as Brazil is rich and complex due to the mixing of three separate traditions—Indian native, Black African, and Portuguese. In Brazil, the African influence on Brazilian folkdances is considerable. For example, capoeiraa dance-like fighting styleand the maculelê fighting dance are strongly reminiscent of African dances. Capoeira is of particular interest. In the 19th century, Capoeira was played mostly by African slaves who had been brought from West Central Africa, making them the original capoeristas and making the art a complex <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> interaction, expressing the participants' physical skills and spiritual essence, involving the gods and {{the spirits of the}} ancestral fathers. The participants played during festivals and holidays, jumping and leaping in front of musical bands, military troops, and religious processions. This dance “game” was considered dangerous to public order and was eventually criminalized in the late 19th century.|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{categories of}} the Marxist conception <b>of</b> history, the <b>social</b> base and superstructure are still today the subject of discussion by Marxist-oriented authors. The effort is emphasized to reject the rigid and schematic application of the assumptions of Marx and Engels {{on the basis of}} the results of modern sociological and other research and to affirm authentic dialectical thinking about relations within the elements <b>of</b> the total <b>social</b> structure. One <b>of</b> the questions in the theory of culture which has not received sufficient attention is the Marxist approach to the phenomenon of values as models of thinking, experiencing and behavior. In the articulation of structural elements <b>of</b> the <b>social</b> superstructure, <b>of</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> consciousness, values cannot be understood as one <b>of</b> the <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> consciousness, but as a standard of thinking and cultural formation which is at the bases <b>of</b> all <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> consciousness-morality. It is possible to establish three groups <b>of</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> consciousness with respect to the creativity of individuals and separate social groups, and with respect to the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> collective creativity and creativity <b>of</b> <b>social</b> psychology in general. These are: differentiated <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> consciousness (morality, rules of behavior, customs, religion); philosophy, science, art; and non-differentiated <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> consciousness (mentality, social psychology). The primacy of material-production relations in a dialectical linkage with <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> consciousness is apparent only in the realm of the politico-legal superstructure, while in other realms of spiritual activity and cultural formation other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> relations are observed: the dialectical interdependence of equal factors which leads to specifically complex phenomena of spiritual »production« in which social values appear rather varied. For modern society, the conflict of traditional and new values originating under the influence of revolutionary workers movements of the 19 th and 20 th centuries is not so characteristic as the destruction of the one and the other...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Social {{exclusion}} is a multi dimensional {{phenomenon that}} {{manifests itself in}} the exclusion of an individual from {{one or more of}} the four following activities: production of goods and services, consumption, civil engagement, and social interaction. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been argued to have the potential to reduce these <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> exclusion. However, the extent to which they deal with these different <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> exclusion remains unknown. Therefore, in this study we examine how ICT policies in South Africa are being employed to reduce social exclusion. In particular, we analyze which dimensions <b>of</b> <b>social</b> exclusion are targeted in telecommunication laws and one of the ICT initiatives of the South African government, Multi-Purpose Community Centers (MPCCs). Using a frame-work that portrays the four <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> exclusion within the discourses used in phenomenon debates (redistributionist, moral underclass, and social integrationist) for analysis, we find that ICT policies in South Africa address two <b>of</b> the four <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> exclusion: production <b>of</b> goods and services and civil engagement, spanning both the redistributionist and <b>social</b> integrationist discourses <b>of</b> <b>social</b> exclusion...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{how different}} <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> capital {{are associated with}} different types of innovation across regional policy interventions. Taking {{the case of a}} continuum of three policy interventions incorporating both 'hard'/traditional and 'soft'/non-traditional innovation measures, the analysis finds that differing regional innovation programmes are connected with different <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> capital generation. Significant associations are found between the types of innovation generated and differing <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> capital. In particular, the elements <b>of</b> <b>social</b> capital associated with the benefits <b>of</b> <b>social</b> networks is positively related to softer <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> innovation. However, there is also evidence that the positive influence <b>of</b> <b>social</b> networks varies in strength across policy interventions, suggesting a strong contextual and environmental influence on this relationship.

40|$|Despite its imprecision, {{social capital}} is a {{powerful}} tool for examining how and why particular <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> interaction lead to {{the health and well-being of}} communities, organisations, and even businesses. Community cohesion as a policy prescription emerged in the UK, following the social disturbances in certain northern cities and towns in the summer of 2001. The official reports into these disturbances identified lack <b>of</b> <b>social</b> interaction between different ethnic groups as a principal cause. Furthermore, social housing was seen as a key factor that could be used to prevent future disturbances. Accordingly, this research focuses on how the assets and <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> capital act as good predictors of community cohesion, in the context of the New Labour government¿s aim to use social housing to build cohesive communities. Unless otherwise specified, references to ¿the government¿ throughout this thesis apply to the New Labour administration that came to power in the UK on 2 nd May 1997 and ended with the Coalition administration led by the Conservatives on 11 th May 2010. This thesis makes use of the linearity between the goals <b>of</b> <b>social</b> capital and the policy aims of community cohesion to match <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> capital to specific <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> interaction, in six selected social housing schemes in Bradford.
