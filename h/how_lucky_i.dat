She felt Reeves was [...] "just wonderful... He was really inspiring to work with. And because {{it was my first}} film I didn't know <b>how</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>I</b> was." [...] At 21, she found appearing in the love and rape scenes [...] "stressful". She would go on to make several more horror movies for AIP, most of them co-starring Price, before retiring from acting in the late 1970s.|$|E
500|$|Nicole is Roman Harris' (Conrad Coleby) {{daughter}} {{and she was}} often mentioned on-screen before producers decided to introduce her into the serial. In January2008 {{it was announced that}} ex-Neighbours star Tessa James had been cast as Nicole. Executive producer Cameron Welsh said [...] "She is an exciting talent and I think audiences are going to love her character and respond really well to her." [...] James then moved to Sydney especially for the role. Speaking of working on the serial James stated: [...] "Working on a series like this [...] is the best training you can get, I look at it like an apprenticeship and never forget <b>how</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>I</b> am." [...] Fellow cast member Celeste Dodwell who plays Melody Jones originally auditioned for the part of Nicole. After Coleby who plays Roman quit the serial, James' time with the show was in doubt.|$|E
500|$|In Europe in the 1990s, a {{successful}} driver would usually progress from Formula Three either directly to Formula One, {{the pinnacle of}} the sport, or to the International Formula 3000 championship. However, Hill {{did not have enough}} sponsorship available to fund a drive in F3000. He says [...] "I ended up having to reappraise my career a bit. The first thing was to realise <b>how</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>I</b> was to be driving anything. I made the decision that whatever I drove I would do it {{to the best of my}} ability and see where it led." [...] He took a one-off drive in the lower level British F3000 championship and shared a Porsche 962 at Le Mans for Richard Lloyd Racing, where the engine failed after 228laps. He also competed in one race in the British Touring Car Championship at Donington Park, driving a Ford Sierra RS500. Midway through the season, an opportunity arose at the uncompetitive Mooncraft F3000 team. The team tested Hill and Perry McCarthy. Their performances were comparable but according to the team manager, John Wickham, the team sponsors preferred the Hill name. Although his best result was a 15th place, Hill's race performances for Mooncraft led to an offer to drive a Lola chassis for Middlebridge Racing in 1990. He took three pole positions and led five races in 1990, but did not win a race during his Formula 3000 career.|$|E

She revealed that the song's lyrical content had also made it {{hard for her to}} perform it live, saying [...] "It's not even the sad parts of it because I'm not there. I'm not in that place anymore, like where I'm sad about it. I'm in a very forgiving place about it and everybody's human. But I think I get really choked up because I just realize <b>how</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>I</b> am... And a lot of girls that grew up with their daddy issues and with not having that figure in their life, you know, take a very different road, and I just feel lucky that I'm not that girl." [...] To promote the album, Clarkson had also performed the song in a stripped-down performance as part of her set list during her Piece by Piece Tour. On February 25, 2016, she performed [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] in a live performance a year after its release on the fifteenth season of American Idol. Her rendition of the song was met with a standing ovation from the audience and critical acclaim from music critics— with Olivia Waring Metro praising it as poignant while USA Todays Erin Jensen describing it as a [...] "heartfelt performance that we just can't get enough of". On March 3, 2016, Clarkson appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show where she discussed her American Idol performance and closed the program with a rendition of the song.|$|E

I always give, and I do that because I know <b>how</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>I</b> am, to do my job." [...] She also promised that the tour would be more emotional than The Beyoncé Experience because of the [...] "real raw and more sensitive" [...] nature of the I Am... portion of the double album. Knowles also expressed frustration that snippets of the show appeared online after the first shows on the opening leg, [...] "ruining" [...] some of the surprise of the concert experience and possibly convincing some fans not to attend. She went on saying: [...] "It's great because people can get a little sneak peek and say, 'Oh, I wanna come to the show,' or, 'I don't wanna go to that show'... and I'm fans of people so I go on there and check it out too. But you put so much of your heart and time into the wardrobe... it's kind of unfortunate that people can see the show months before you get into their city, but that's life." [...] French designer Thierry Mugler collaborated with Knowles on the wardrobe and had a creative advisor role, as he also contributed to designing the whole show, from lighting to choreography, production and directing three sequences for the concert.

After meeting him, Eulenburg declared his “boundless love” for the prince. During this period, Eulenburg started to share his love of the occult with his new best friend. In August 1887, Eulenburg wrote to Prince Wilhelm about a séance he had recently organized, that [...] "I was overjoyed that {{we find ourselves in}} agreement in this area as well, and it has shown me clearly yet again <b>how</b> very <b>lucky</b> <b>I</b> have been to meet Your Royal Highness!

500|$|In {{terms of}} the lyrics, Streisand opens the song by humming the first few lines ("Badodiodiodi / Odiodo"), {{followed}} by the chorus, where she questions, [...] "Gee, whee, wow, <b>how</b> <b>lucky?</b> / <b>How</b> <b>lucky</b> can you get?". The short musical interlude in [...] "How Lucky Can You Get" [...] switches from a four-bar to an eight-bar phrase, just as it [...] "returns to its original key" [...] and the lyrics become [...] "outwardly straightforward". During the final two verses of the song, Streisand talks to herself and questions, [...] "Hey there, gorgeous! / Big success! / What's your secret? / Just <b>lucky</b> <b>I</b> guess". James Leve, who wrote the biography book Kander and Ebb, referred to these lyrics as ironic and claimed that the music that accompanies the aforementioned four lines was borrowed from Giacomo Puccini's 1896 opera, La bohème.|$|R
