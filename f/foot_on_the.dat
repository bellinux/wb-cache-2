5|$|A {{player is}} only allowed {{to catch a}} fly ball on {{the first step of}} the dugout. If the player has one <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first step and his other <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second step the ball is ruled non-playable and the player is not allowed to catch it.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 31 October 1956 that anyone set <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> South Pole again; on that day a U.S. Navy group led by Rear Admiral George J. Dufek {{successfully}} landed an aircraft there. The first women to step onto the South Pole were Pam Young, Jean Pearson, Lois Jones, Eileen McSaveney, Kay Lindsay and Terry Tickhill in 1969.|$|E
5|$|As {{their journey}} continues, the Kushan fleet gives {{sanctuary}} to the Taiidan rebel Captain Elson. With his help, they rally a rebellion {{to distract the}} Taiidan fleets. He aids them in penetrating the Hiigaran system blockade, and in engaging the central Taiidan fleet led by the Taiidan emperor. During the final battle, the emperor manages to knock S'jet into a coma, but the combined Kushan and rebel fleets defeat the Taiidan regardless. The Galactic Council arrives shortly thereafter and confirms the Kushan's claim to Hiigara, a lush world {{in contrast to the}} desert planet of Kharak. When the Kushan make landfall, the awakened Karan insists to be the last one to set <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> planet.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from his}} run-scoring, Barnes, who {{was well known}} for being eccentric, gained fame {{throughout}} the season for his fielding at short leg—just a few metres from the batsman—where he took 19 catches for the season. Barnes stood much closer than others who fielded in the position, placing one <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of the pitch. His extreme proximity prompted questions about the legitimacy of his action and English captain Norman Yardley later admitted that Barnes had intimidated his batsmen.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive {{features}} of Ehrhardt include an 'A' with gently curving bar matching the centre-link of the 'B', a wide 'T' with spreadeagled serifs {{on either side}} and a 'b' with no <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left. In italic the 'J' has a crossbar, the 'w' has sharp reverse curves towards the top and left, and the 'v' has a flourish on the left. The face has high stroke contrast (difference between thick and thin strokes) {{by the standards of}} most old-style serif fonts. In order to allow compact line spacing, descenders were kept reasonably short.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have five}} toes on each foot, with unsheathed, {{retractable}} claws. Their feet are disproportionately large for their legs, {{making it easier}} for them to move on top of snow packs. In addition to the toes, there are four central pads on each <b>foot.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> hind paws there are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when walking on a variety of surfaces. Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180 degrees, allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head-first. The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species with the ability to descend trees head-first.|$|E

It {{is part of the}} Southern Blue Ridge Mountains Subsection within the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province. A tectonic uplift of the mountains created many high gradient streams.|$|R

5|$|Following {{the third}} match, Larry Zybysko {{revealed}} that Raven's opponent {{for the night}} was Sean Waltman. The two then fought in a No Disqualification match with the stipulation that if Raven won he gained a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match, but if he lost he would be fired from TNA. During the bout, the referee was knocked out with Zbyszko taking over his duties. Waltman won the contest after forcing Raven face-first off of a ladder through a table with his signature X-Factor maneuver. Zbyszko counted the pin despite Raven's <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom rope at 10 minutes. As {{a result of his}} loss, Raven was fired from TNA in the storyline.|$|E
5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{visited the}} set {{frequently}} during filming. Members {{of the main}} cast approached Stillwell with questions {{about the nature of}} the altered universe, trying to determine if they were still playing the same characters. Goldberg asked Ganino about changing a piece of dialogue on set, but since Ganino was not the author of the teleplay, he deferred to Stillwell, who in turn notified the production office. When Berman found out that Ganino and Stillwell were on set and talking to the actors, he banned them from setting <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sets again.|$|E
5|$|Georges Dumézil {{theorized that}} Víðarr {{represents}} a cosmic figure from an archetype {{derived from the}} Proto-Indo-Europeans. Dumézil stated that he was aligned with both vertical space, due to his placement of his <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wolf's lower jaw and {{his hand on the}} wolf's upper jaw, and horizontal space, due to his wide step and strong shoe, and that, by killing the wolf, Víðarr keeps the wolf from destroying the cosmos, and the cosmos can thereafter be restored after the destruction resulting from Ragnarök.|$|E

It is very similar to the heelie, where the skater places both <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of the board and performs a manual <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back two wheels of the board.|$|R
5|$|Like {{previous}} installments in the Tales series, Tales of Symphonia consists {{primarily of}} three major areas: an overworld field map, town and dungeon maps, and a battle screen. The overworld map is a 3D model, featuring a scaled-down {{version of the}} game's fictional world which the player travels through to reach the game's locations. As with preceding games in the series, the world map can be traversed by <b>foot,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> party's quadrupedal pet Noishe, and on flying vehicles known as Rheairds. On field maps, characters are directed across realistically scaled environments. The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area, in which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.|$|E
5|$|Tales of Graces {{consists}} {{primarily of}} two major areas: the field map and a battle screen. The field map is a realistically scaled 3D environment traversed by <b>foot.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> field maps, various skits between the characters can be viewed. They involve animated character portraits, subtitles, and full voice acting. Skits concern anything from character development to side details. The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area, in which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.|$|E
5|$|The eggs {{have large}} yolks; {{cleavage}} (division) is superficial and a germinal disc develops at the pole. During gastrulation, {{the margins of}} this grow down and surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. The arms and funnel develop {{as part of the}} <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a ring around the funnel and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo develops.|$|E

5|$|The second {{featured}} bout on the undercard was {{a standard}} {{match for the}} WWE United States Championship between Eddie Guerrero, and The Big Show. Guerrero {{used a variety of}} tactics including forcing Big Show's head into an exposed turnbuckle, striking him with a trash can lid, punching him with brass knuckles and striking him with the title belt. After hitting Show with the belt, Guerrero performed a frog splash for a near-fall. Show then performed a chokeslam but Guerrero placed his <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rope. Show then performed another chokeslam on Guerrero to win the title.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{feature on}} the wall of the front porch on the ground floor is a foot print on a stone slab. It is said that this foot print belonged to a {{resident}} of the monastery, who was a water carrier, known as Chitenpa. He served in the monastery for a long time and on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stone slab which created a dented formation of his step. This step is venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of the region that such an imprint on a stone slab could only be created by a divine person who was a true devotee of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|About 20minutes {{after the}} first step, Aldrin joined Armstrong {{on the surface and}} became the second human to set <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon, and the duo began their tasks of {{investigating}} how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Early on, they unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight, and also planted the flag of the United States. The flag used on this mission had a metal rod to hold it horizontal from its pole. Since the rod did not fully extend, and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze. Shortly after their flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by a telephone call from his office. The President spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.|$|E

5|$|Born in Oslo in 1864 to a Norwegian {{father and}} an English mother, Carsten Borchgrevink emigrated to Australia in 1888, {{where he worked}} on survey teams in the {{interior}} before accepting a provincial schoolteaching appointment in New South Wales. In 1894 he joined a commercial expedition, led by Henryk Bull in the whaler Antarctic, which penetrated Antarctic waters and reached Cape Adare, the western portal to the Ross Sea. A party including Bull and Borchgrevink briefly landed there and {{claimed to be the}} first men to set <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Antarctic continent—although the American sealer John Davis believed he had landed on the Antarctic Peninsula in 1821. They also visited Possession Island in the Ross Sea, leaving a message in a tin box as proof of their journey. Borchgrevink was convinced that the Cape Adare location, with its huge penguin rookery providing a ready supply of fresh food and blubber, could serve as a base at which a future expedition could overwinter and subsequently explore the Antarctic interior.|$|E
5|$|Both Burgoyne and Arnold {{understood}} {{the importance of}} the American left, and the need to control the heights there. After the morning fog lifted around 10 am, Burgoyne ordered the army to advance in three columns. Baron Riedesel led the left column, consisting of the German troops and the 47th <b>Foot,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> river road, bringing the main artillery and guarding supplies and the boats on the river. General James Inglis Hamilton commanded the center column, consisting of the 9th, 20th, 21st, and 62nd regiments, which would attack the heights, and General Simon Fraser led the right wing with the 24th Regiment and the light infantry and grenadier companies, to turn the American left flank by negotiating the heavily wooded high ground north and west of Bemis Heights.|$|E
5|$|Bradman's {{relentless}} use of {{his pace}} attack and fieldsmen also raised eyebrows. At the time, Lindwall and Miller were groundbreaking fast bowlers, with high pace {{and the ability to}} deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the upper body of the English batsmen. Prior to the Second World War, pace bowlers were generally much slower and did not often bowl at the body. England had yet to develop bowlers such as Lindwall and Miller, and as a result, Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation. At times, the public found Lindwall and Miller's short-pitched bowling to be excessive and booed the Australians. On the fielding front, Barnes was deployed as close to the bat as possible at either forward short-leg or point, with one <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pitch. This had an intimidatory effect on the batsmen and led many to question whether it was {{in the spirit of the}} game.|$|E
50|$|In proportion, {{the flag}} is six <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pole length and nine <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fly length and {{is divided into}} three equal {{horizontal}} divisions. In the upper pole corner is a two-foot canton of azure blue representing Loyalty. In the lower pole corner is a like canton of red signifying Bravery. The entire center division is white denoting Faith.|$|R
50|$|Battery LeRoy is a {{historic}} artillery battery located at James Island, Charleston, South Carolina. It was built in 1863, and designed to protect lower James Island. At {{the end of the}} war this battery mounted four guns. The earthen redoubt measures approximately 340 <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> its right face, 140 <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> center face and 160 <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left face. It has a 15-foot-high parapet wall and a slightly higher powder magazine.|$|R
