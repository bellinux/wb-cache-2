The first is that the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> law is still relevant, while the second is that all <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> law go to jurisdiction. The third view takes a middle ground that allows for certain exceptions to the approach in the second view.|$|E
5|$|Errors as to {{precedent}} facts, {{sometimes called}} jurisdictional facts, in Singapore administrative law are errors committed by public authorities concerning facts that must objectively exist or not exist before the authorities {{have the power}} to take actions or make decisions under legislation. If an error concerning a precedent fact is made, the statutory power has not been exercised lawfully and may be quashed by the High Court if judicial review is applied for by an aggrieved person. The willingness of the Court to review such <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> fact is an exception to the general rule that the Court only reviews <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> law.|$|E
40|$|The {{title of}} this paper is <b>Errors</b> in Compositions <b>of</b> The Students of SMKN 2 Tegallalang. The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore the grammatical errors made by the students of SMKN 2 Tegallalang in practicing their English. The theory applied for this paper is Error Analysis, Perspectives on Second Language Acquisition (1974) edited by Jack C. Richards. The data of the analysis of this paper are taken from the compositions by the students of SMKN 2 Tegallalang. Then the errors were collected and classified based on the types <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> according to the theory applied. The finding shows that they made some errors when they made a sentence. Actually they seem to be clever to use English in writing grammatically, however they are lack of knowledge as seen in the errors encountered in their statement. The error found can be classified into <b>error</b> <b>of</b> using singular-plural, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> using word form, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> using word choice, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> using verb tense, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> using add word, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> omit word, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> using word order, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> spelling, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> using punctuation, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> using article, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> meaning not clear, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> run on sentence...|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a question of fact involves a matter concerning primary facts such as a new witness or what people saw or heard, while a question of law involves an application of a statutory word or phase to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place. In any case, it is said that the courts generally treat <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> fact committed by public authorities differently from <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> law. While <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> law are regarded by the courts as within their jurisdiction and thus subject to judicial review, they show more reluctance to intervene when <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> fact are alleged.|$|E

5|$|Exclusion of {{judicial}} review has been attempted by the Parliament of Singapore to protect the exercise of executive power. Typically, this has been done though the insertion of finality or total ouster clauses into Acts of Parliament, or by wording powers conferred by Acts on decision-makers subjectively. Finality clauses are generally viewed restrictively by courts in the United Kingdom. The courts there have taken the view that such clauses are, subject to some exceptions, not effective in denying or restricting {{the extent to which}} the courts are able to exercise judicial review. In contrast, Singapore cases suggest that ouster clauses cannot prevent the High Court from exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the exercise of executive power where authorities have committed jurisdictional <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> law, but are effective against non-jurisdictional <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> law.|$|E

For example, for a particle moving on an oval billiard table, even small changes of the initial conditions result in very different paths of the particle. Such systems are chaotic in a deterministic way, because small measurement <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> the initial state predictably lead to largely different final states. At least one Lyapunov exponent of a deterministically chaotic system is positive.|$|E

One {{was a failure}} to recognize after {{the first wave of}} attacks that his chosen method of attack was unlikely to work. Instead of ordering additional waves of troops to the slaughter, he should have retreated to a safe distance and considered alternative actions. The second failure was that he apparently never considered ordering a flanking maneuver against the French right. At a minimum this would have stretched the French defenses, allowing his attackers elsewhere to find weak points. In fact, the French twice in the battle sent companies of militia out of their works on the right to enfilade the British attackers.|$|E

40|$|A {{steady-state}} microchannel split-system {{simulation model}} has been developed based on previous research at the ACRC. This model was utilized as a design tool to optimize a microchannel split system {{with the goal of}} minimizing TEWI, or total equivalent warming impact. The system components were then selected and the optimized microchannel heat exchangers were fabricated. Next, the entire system was assembled and extensive tests were run at steady state conditions over a wide range of outdoor ambient conditions in a calorimeter test facility. The experimental results have been compared to the simulations for the purpose of model refinement and its eventual validation. The full system model overpredicts the total capacity of the system with a minimum <b>error</b> <b>of</b> 0. 2 %, a mean <b>error</b> <b>of</b> 5 %, and a maximum <b>error</b> <b>of</b> 11 %. The evaporator submodel overpredicts the total capacity as well, with a minimum <b>error</b> <b>of</b> 0. 7 %, a mean <b>error</b> <b>of</b> 7 %, and a maximum <b>error</b> <b>of</b> 11 %. The condenser submodel also overpredicts with a minimum <b>error</b> <b>of</b> 0. 5 %, a mean <b>error</b> <b>of</b> 2 %, and a maximum <b>error</b> <b>of</b> 6 %. A major reason for the lower accuracy with the evaporator is because of the refrigerant maldisribution observed in the experiments.
