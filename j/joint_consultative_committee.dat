40|$|The Australian {{industrial}} relations landscape has changed significantly. An increasingly hostile political {{environment and the}} emergence of human resource management (HRM) have seen the role of union voice decline significantly. Drawing on responses from the 2004 Australian Worker Representation and Participation Survey (AWRPS), this article examines the incidence and predictors of joint consultation, and employees' perceptions of the effectiveness of joint consultation. The study finds that joint consultation is a popular feature of the workplace. Joint consultation was highest in unionized workplaces, and the presence of a union and favourable management attitudes to unions are statistically significant predictors of <b>joint</b> <b>consultative</b> <b>committees</b> (JCC). Employees also report JCCs to be highly effective. The article concludes that joint consultation, as an alternative mechanism in Australian workplaces, is viewed as an effective form of voice...|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} impact of legal and policy changes {{regarding}} management consultation with employees in Australia over the period 1991 to 2004. Whilst comprehensive data is available regarding the incidence of <b>Joint</b> <b>Consultative</b> <b>Committees</b> (JCCs) until 1995, little or no {{research has been conducted}} into the prevalence of JCCs in Australian workplaces since the Workplace Relations Act 1996 was passed, bringing with it a downgrading of statutory support for workplace consultation. Have these changes resulted in an increase or a decrease in consultative practices? If there has been a continued increase, what might have stimulated this unexpected development? Data from the Sydney University Workplace Research Centre&# 039;s (formerly ACIRRT) Agreements Database and Monitor (ADAM) are considered in order to sketch a broad picture of JCCs in Australian Federal and State jurisdictions from 1991 to 2004 (although the data for 2004 was limited to state jurisdictions). The data suggests that the provision for JCCs in enterprise agreements increased in this period. The article finds that although this increase may have occurred in the absence of legislative backing, in order to act as democratic employee representative bodies, legislative support is required which stipulates both the powers and membership or constitution of ongoing mechanisms for consultation with employees. The article concludes by exploring several international comparisons that may guide legal and policy options for the further encouragement of workplace democracy in Australia...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{the impact}} of {{representative}} employee participation on firm performance has hitherto been confined to single country studies, notably Germany. Comparative country studies are rare. In the present paper the basis is laid for international comparative research, by reviewing {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the (theoretical and empirical) literature and examining the distinctive features of four neighbouring countries with respect to their industrial relations systems. We show that Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, despite the implementation of the EU Directive on Information and Consultation rights, display a large variation in their institutional setting, resulting in very different characteristics regarding worker involvement at establishment level. Depending on the country at issue, works councils or <b>joint</b> <b>consultative</b> <b>committees</b> exert influence in very different degrees, and also the power of trade unions differs substantially. The existing theoretical framework that dominates empirical work does not take these differences sufficiently into account. Moreover, existing empirical work primarily focuses on the effects of the mere presence of a worker representation body on organizational outcomes, not taking into account differences in the actual functioning of these worker bodies. The underlying study demonstrates that variances in (formal and informal) rights and in group dynamics will greatly impact the effectiveness of any form of employee representation. This ultimately leads to the construction of our adjusted comparative model, which does aim to take all these differences into account, when explaining the relationship between worker involvement and organisational performance. ...|$|R

Peter McPherson to request program assistance to enable the Roundtable to develop its task force and subcommittee activities for more substantive focus in various agro-food processing, distribution, technology and finance sectors. This approach would have insured greater private sector participation as well which appealed to the Reagan Administration. However, just as the AID interest in the proposal seemed to gel, a reorganization at the White House undercut higher level encouragement at a critical juncture and AID’s Bureau for Science and Technology (S&T) itself underwent a sharp downsizing- which effectively left AER’s proposal shelved and unnoticed.

50|$|However, {{perceived}} drawbacks of {{the scheme}} were {{that it did}} not link to final pay, access was contingent on a medical examination, there was no guarantee for dependents, little provision for risk benefits, and no indexation of benefits. Hence it compared unfavourably to the defined benefit scheme already enjoyed by school teachers under the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act 1918. From 1958 to 1969 several committees were established to review the present arrangements. The recommendations for a DB scheme were initially rejected by Universities in 1960 and again by a committee in 1964, who concluded it was “…unable to make a clear recommendation in favour of either system ”. The <b>Joint</b> <b>Consultative</b> <b>Committee</b> (JCC), established in 1969, commissioned a report from G. Heywood (FSSU Consulting Actuary) that included a proposed outline for USS.

40|$|Australia’s steel {{industry}} underwent a transformation {{starting in the}} 1980 s {{in response to an}} international collapse in demand and steeply heightened competition; such a crisis that it threatened the closure of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company’s iconic steelworks located at Newcastle on Australia’s eastern seaboard. Central to this transformation was the shift by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company from the firm’s highly confrontational approach to industrial relations to one that was far more collaborative. Gradual at first, the shift in participation with the steel unions accelerated so that by 1996 a <b>joint</b> management–union <b>consultative</b> <b>committee</b> – the Transition Steering Team – had been established at the Newcastle steelworks to facilitate a shift to electric arc furnace steelmaking.

We analyse the views of key health sector managers such as the chief executive officers, human resource directors and general functional managers concerning their experiences and perceptions of employee participation and extent of participatory practices in their organisations. Findings suggest that community health centres reported higher means on the presence of employee participation practices relative to their larger health service counterparts, including the metropolitan health services. However, all levels of managers across the entire health sector reported the absence of formal employee participation practices such as a formal <b>joint</b> <b>consultative</b> <b>committee</b> and employee suggestion schemes at the organisation. We also found that different hierarchical managers held quite different views concerning the use of employee participation practices.

40|$|By March 1977, the Labour {{government}} which had narrowly been re-elected in the October 1974 election, {{had lost its}} parliamentary majority, and was facing {{a vote of confidence}} tabled by the Conservative opposition. Senior Labour figures thus desperately sought to secure support from one of the minor parties. Unable to broker a deal with either the Ulster Unionists or the Scottish National Party (SNP), largely due to ideological differences, the Labour leadership entered into negotiations with the Liberal leader, David Steel. The result was that the Liberal Party agreed to provide the Labour government with parliamentary support, in return for consultation, via a joint committee, over future policies, coupled with the reintroduction of devolution legislation, and a pledge to provide for direct elections for the European parliament (ideally using some form of proportional representation). There was some surprise that Steel had not pressed for more, or stronger, policy commitments or concessions from the Labour prime minister, James Callaghan, but Steel was thinking long term; he envisaged that Liberal participation in the <b>joint</b> <b>consultative</b> <b>committee</b> would foster closer co-operation between Liberals and Labour moderates/social democrats, and eventually facilitate a realignment of British politics by marginalising both the Labour left, and the increasingly right-wing Conservatives Party...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Workplace Employment Relations Survey (WERS) Time-Series Dataset 1980 - 2011 {{is derived from the}} data collected in the interviews with the main management respondent in each of the cross-section surveys in the Workplace Employment Relations Survey series (1980, 1984, 1990, 1998, 2004 and 2011) and the 1991 Employers' Manpower Skills Practices Survey (a follow-up to the 1990 WIRS). The dataset contains consistently defined variables (where possible) for data items that are present in the 1998, 2004 or 2011 surveys and at least one other previous cross-section survey in the series. Taking a topic such as the presence of a multi-issue <b>joint</b> <b>consultative</b> <b>committee</b> (Questions: DJOINT and DISSUES), similar questions were first identified in each of the 1980, 1984 and 1990 surveys. The 1991 EMSPS also served as a source of data in instances where an issue was not covered in WIRS 90 but was covered in EMSPS. If the questions that were found across the series were considered sufficiently similar to permit the compilation of a consistent measure, a data item would be derived from each of the relevant survey data files in turn (see syntax files Get 80 ts. sps, Get 84 ts. sps, etc.). Having derived these consistent data items, workplace records from each of the surveys were then added together (see MergeTS. sps) to form a single time-series dataset that spanned the whole of the series. An additional variable named YEAR was also added to the dataset to identify the survey from which each individual observation originates. Further details may be found in the documentation and on the gov. uk WERS 2011 webpage. The time-series dataset also contains a link variable (TEUKLEMS) that enables observations to be linked to the EU KLEMS industry-level database, which provides measures of economic growth, productivity, employment creation, capital formation and technological change at the industry level for the UK from 1970 onwards. Further information {{can be found at the}} EU KLEMS Project web page. For the third edition (September 2014), data for 2011 have been added to the time series file and the documentation updated accordingly. The SPSS syntax used for the addition of the 2011 data has also been deposited. Main Topics : The WIRS/WERS series provides statistically reliable, nationally representative data on the state of workplace relations and employment practices in Britain. In each of the five cross-section surveys in the series, the main management respondent (the most senior manager at the workplace with responsibility for employment relations) has been asked mainly factual questions covering a wide range of issues that deal with the employment relationship.
