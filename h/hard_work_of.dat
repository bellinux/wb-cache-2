5|$|Given {{both teams}} {{were in the}} highest tier of English football, the Premier League, they entered the {{competition}} in the third round. Each needed to progress through five rounds to reach the final. Arsenal's progress was relatively comfortable; after scoring six past Queens Park Rangers, they knocked out holders Chelsea in the fifth round and later came from behind to beat local rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the semi-final. Liverpool by contrast made <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> overcoming lower-league opponents Tranmere Rovers and Wycombe Wanderers in the latter rounds of the competition. The final {{marked the first time}} that two managers born outside the British Isles had met in an FA Cup final – French compatriots Arsène Wenger and Gérard Houllier.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning of}} the {{evacuation}} promised a perfect day. The sun rose out of a calm and sparkling sea and warmed the impassive cliffs of Oiseval. The sky was hopelessly blue {{and the sight of}} Hirta, green and pleasant as the island of so many careless dreams, made parting all the more difficult. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked all the doors and at 7am boarded the Harebell. Although exhausted by the strain and <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the last few days, they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto the horizon and the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.|$|E

25|$|The Mughals invaded Assam {{seventeen}} times, {{and they}} were defeated by the Ahoms in Battle of Itakhuli and Battle of Saraighat. During the Battle of Saraighat, fought in Saraighat in 1671, the Mughals were overrun due to the strong leadership and <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Lachit Borphukan. The great embankment called ‘Mumai-Kota Gorh’, named after an incident in which Lachit had to slay (Kota) his own maternal uncle (Mumai) for being lazy in building the embankment (Gorh) that runs along {{the outskirts of the}} city, stands as a proof of the hard work and war-readiness {{on the part of the}} Ahoms. There was an ancient boat yard in Dighalipukhuri, probably used by the Ahoms in medieval times. Medieval constructions include temples, ramparts, etc. in the city.|$|E

25|$|Brazil's {{win over}} the hosts helped {{take them to the}} final against Italy. While Brazil's path was {{relatively}} smooth as they defeated the Netherlands in the quarterfinals and Sweden in the semis, the Italians had made <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> reaching the final. During the group stage Italy struggled and narrowly advanced to the next round, despite losing 1–0 to the Republic of Ireland. Italian playmaker Roberto Baggio, who was expected {{to be one of the}} stars of the tournament, had not yet scored a goal. During the Round of 16 game against Nigeria, Italy was trailing 1–0 in the dying minutes when Baggio scored the tying goal, forcing the game into extra time. He scored again with a penalty kick to send Italy through. Baggio carried the Italians from there, scoring the game-winning goal in the quarterfinal against Spain, and both goals in Italy's semifinal victory over Bulgaria.|$|E
25|$|Frequency {{analysis}} {{requires only}} {{a basic understanding}} of the statistics of the plaintext language and some problem solving skills, and, if performed by hand, tolerance for extensive letter bookkeeping. During World War II (WWII), both the British and the Americans recruited codebreakers by placing crossword puzzles in major newspapers and running contests for who could solve them the fastest. Several of the ciphers used by the Axis powers were breakable using frequency analysis, for example, some of the consular ciphers used by the Japanese. Mechanical methods of letter counting and statistical analysis (generally IBM card type machinery) were first used in World War II, possibly by the US Army's SIS. Today, the <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> letter counting and analysis has been replaced by computer software, which can carry out such analysis in seconds. With modern computing power, classical ciphers are unlikely to provide any real protection for confidential data.|$|E
25|$|The final on 16 August drew {{fans from}} both sides of the River Thames and filled the 30,000 {{capacity}} ground (a huge crowd for domestic cricket). Kent won the toss and elected to bat first, a decision which many pundits suggested eventually cost Kent the final. Kent were left limping after losing openers Joe Denly and Rob Key. It was only a 53 by overseas star Martin van Jaarsveld and 63 from fellow South African Ryan McLaren that helped Kent to a modest 214 all out. Initially Essex made <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> chasing down the total after losing Alastair Cook as the 4th wicket for 93 runs. However, the experience of Grant Flower (70 not out) and his partnership with Ryan ten Doeschate (30 not out) helped Essex over the line with 7 balls to spare. Essex had thus won The Friends Provident Trophy for the third time after previous successes in 1985 and 1997.|$|E

25|$|After a {{very public}} row, it was finally decided in Australia that the AIF would play three of the state teams: Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. The team arrived home in December and were at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) 16 to 19 January for the first match against Victoria which they won by six wickets. Collins won the toss against his future Test captain Warwick Armstrong and put Victoria in. Gregory took seven for 22 and bowled them out for only 116. The AIF batsmen {{had to contend with}} Ted McDonald, Gregory's future Test bowling partner, and he took a modest three for 76 as Willis scored 111 in a total of 311. At close of play on the second day, Victoria had reached 31 for one. They totalled 270 all out with Lampard taking seven for 99. The AIF needed 76 to win and made <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> it, losing four wickets to McDonald and Armstrong before Gregory saw them home.|$|E
25|$|At the 1895 {{elections}} it {{was clear}} that there were divisions as to what issue the Liberals were fighting for. The effect of Harcourt's aborted Local Veto Bill, which would have given parishes the right to vote on the closure of all local public houses, on the election was seen not only in his defeat at Derby, which gave the signal for the Liberal rout, but in the set-back it gave to temperance legislation. Though returned for West Monmouthshire (1895, 1900), Harcourt's speeches in debate only occasionally showed his characteristic spirit, and it was evident that for the <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> opposition he no longer had the same motivation as of old. In October 1896 Gladstone, in his last public speech, called for action to support the Armenians who were being massacred by their Ottoman rulers. Harcourt backed Gladstone but Rosebery used the incident as an excuse to resign as Leader of the Opposition and Harcourt became an unenthusiastic leader.|$|E
