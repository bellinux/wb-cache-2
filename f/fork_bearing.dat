5000|$|The {{view from}} the summit is beyond all {{adequate}} description. Looking northward {{from the base of}} the mountain the great plateau stretches away to the front and left with its innumerable groves and sparkling waters, a variegated landscape of surpassing beauty, bounded on its extreme verge by the cañons of the Yellowstone. The pure atmosphere of this lofty region causes every outline of tree, rock or lakelet to be visible with wonderful distinctness, and objects twenty miles away appear as if very near at hand. Still further to the left the snowy ranges on the headwaters of Gardiner's river stretch away to the westward, joining those on the head of the Gallatin, and forming, with the Elephant's Back, a continuous chain, bending constantly to the south, the rim of the Yellowstone Basin. On the verge of the horizon appear, like mole hills in the distance, and far below, the white summits above the Gallatin Valley. These never thaw during the summer months, though several thousand feet lower than where we now stand upon the bare granite and no snow visible near, save n the depths of shaded ravines. Beyond the plateau to the right front is the deep valley of the East <b>Fork</b> <b>bearing</b> away eastward, and still beyond, ragged volcanic peaks, heaped in inextricable confusion, as far as the limit of vision extends. On the east, close beneath our feet, yawns the immense gulf of the Grand Cañon, cutting away the bases of two mountains in forcing a passage through the range. Its yellow walls divide the landscape nearly in a straight line to the junction of Warm Spring Creek below. The ragged edges of the chasm are from two hundred to five hundred yards apart, its depth so profound that the river bed is no where visible. No sound reaches the ear from the bottom of the abyss; the sun's rays are reflected on the further wall and then lost in the darkness below. The mind struggles and then falls back upon itself despairing in the effort to grasp by a single thought the idea of its immensity. Beyond, a gentle declivity, sloping from the summit of the broken range, extends to the limit of vision, a wilderness of unbroken pine forest. Gustavus C. Doane, August 29, 1870 ...|$|E

50|$|Didelphimorphs have a {{plantigrade}} stance (feet {{flat on the}} ground) and the hind feet have an opposable digit with no claw. Like some New World monkeys, opossums have prehensile tails. Like all marsupials, the fur {{consists of}} awn hair only, and the females have a pouch. The tail {{and parts of the}} feet bear scutes. The stomach is simple, with a small cecum. Notably, the male opossum has a <b>forked</b> penis <b>bearing</b> twin glandes.|$|R
50|$|Not all <b>forks</b> steer on <b>bearings</b> {{installed}} in a head tube. The forks on Stridas and Pedersen bicycles pivot about an axis external to the fork, supported at two different points on the frame. A new trend in triathlon bikes is similar, called a bayonet or external-steerer fork, but the pivot bearings {{are at the top}} and bottom of something that still resembles a head tube.|$|R
40|$|Background: Because of {{the adverse}} {{environmental}} conditions present in less-resourced environments (LREs), the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that specialised wheelchair test methods {{may need to be}} developed to support product quality standards in these environments. A group of experts identified caster test methods as a high priority because of their common failure in LREs, and the insufficiency of existing test methods described in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Wheelchair Testing Standards (ISO 7176). Objectives: To develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a caster system test method. Method: Background literature and expert opinions were collected to identify existing caster test methods, caster failures common in LREs and environmental conditions present in LREs. Several conceptual designs for the caster testing method were developed, and through an iterative process using expert feedback, a final concept and a design were developed and a prototype was fabricated. Feasibility tests were conducted by testing a series of caster systems from wheelchairs used in LREs, and failure modes were recorded and compared to anecdotal reports about field failures. Results: The new caster testing system was developed and it provides the flexibility to expose caster systems to typical conditions in LREs. Caster failures such as stem bolt fractures, <b>fork</b> fractures, <b>bearing</b> failures and tire cracking occurred during testing trials and are consistent with field failures. Conclusion: The new caster test system has the capability to incorporate necessary test factors that degrade caster quality in LREs. Future work includes developing and validating a testing protocol that results in failure modes common during wheelchair use in LRE...|$|R
5000|$|Allocyclosa is a genus of {{orb weaver}} spiders that {{contains}} only one species, Allocyclosa bifurca. It was first described in 1887 by McCook {{under the name}} Cyrtophora bifurca, and was transferred to its own genus in 1999. It is the only Cyclosa species north of Mexico to have a forked tail, hence the name bifurca, Latin for [...] "two-forked". The <b>forked</b> abdomen, <b>bearing</b> two humps shaped like the letter M, is a defining feature in both males and females, though it is similar to features present in certain Cyrtophora species. Both sexes are a transparent green color, though only females have an area of red on their underside between the epigynum and the spinnerets. Females are nearly thirty percent larger than males, ranging from five to nine millimeters, while males range from two to three millimeters. Males are very uncommon. In a 1977 study by Levi, {{only two of the}} nearly 350 specimens that were positively identified as Cyrtophora bifurca were males. This is a very odd distribution, and it has been posed that females of the species, which have less prominent genitalia relative to other members of the orb-weaver family, may be parthenogenic, or able to reproduce without the help of males. Like other members of Araneidae, these spiders create orb webs, six to eight inches in diameter, but apply a unique form of protective mimicry. Females sit {{in the middle of a}} vertical row of web decoration, with egg sacs above and wrapped prey below. Because they all have a similar color and shape, it is difficult to discern between the egg sacs, the wrapped prey, and the spider itself.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to develop the chassis of an electric motorcycle that takes part in the international competition Smart Moto Challenge 2016, showing the work {{that has been done}} inside the e-Ride ETSEIB team. It focuses on the design of the frame and the swing arm, their FEM simulation and the manufacturing process to obtain them. Design is done taking in account the different requirements that must accomplish the motorcycle, such as the components that must hold the structure or the desired geometry of the chassis. Final design not only includes the frame and the swing arm, but also all the commercial parts that form the chassis assembly: wheels, <b>fork,</b> suspension, brakes, <b>bearings,</b> handlebar, footrests [...] . The FEM study includes stiffness simulations of the frame and the swing arm in order to prove the dynamic properties of the motorcycle. It also has been considered several resistance simulations of the parts of the chassis that receive the higher loads to guarantee that they will resist any unforeseen critical stresses during the life of the motorcycle. All the simulations and the consequent optimization process have been done with the aim of keeping the weight of the tested parts as low as possible. The manufacturing process of both frame and swing arm is explained with detail and has been proved by the manufacturing sponsor that is going to build these parts...|$|R
40|$|Titanosaurian dinosaurs {{include some}} of the largest land-living animals that ever existed, and most were {{discovered}} in Cretaceous deposits of Argentina. Here we describe the first Brazilian gigantic titanosaur, Austroposeidon magnificus gen. et sp. nov., from the Late Cretaceous Presidente Prudente Formation (Bauru Group, Paraná Basin), São Paulo State, southeast Brazil. The size of this animal is estimated around 25 meters. It consists of a partial vertebral column composed by the last two cervical and the first dorsal vertebrae, all fairly complete and incomplete portions of at least one sacral and seven dorsal elements. The new species displays four autapomorphies: robust and tall centropostzygapophyseal laminae (cpol) in the last cervical vertebrae; last cervical vertebra bearing the posterior centrodiapophyseal lamina (pcdl) bifurcated; first dorsal vertebra with the anterior and posterior centrodiapophyseal laminae (acdl/pcdl) curved ventrolaterally, and the diapophysis reaching the dorsal margin of the centrum; posterior dorsal vertebra <b>bearing</b> <b>forked</b> spinoprezygapophyseal laminae (sprl). The phylogenetic analysis presented here reveals that Austroposeidon magnificus is the sister group of the Lognkosauria. CT scans reveal some new osteological internal features in the cervical vertebrae such as the intercalation of dense growth rings with camellae, reported {{for the first time in}} sauropods. The new taxon further shows that giant titanosaurs were also present in Brazil during the Late Cretaceous and provides new information about the evolution and internal osteological structures in the vertebrae of the Titanosauria clade...|$|R
