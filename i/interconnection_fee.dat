40|$|I {{consider}} {{peer effects}} of network externalities {{in a competitive}} telecommunica-tion market. The magnitude of network externalities depends on whether the caller and the receiver {{are in the same}} peer group. Technically, interconnection between carriers can eliminate network externalities, but carriers may adopt termination-based price discrimination to reduce compatibility. When termination-based pricing is prohibited, carriers cannot exploit network externalities. Peer effects are equiva-lent to consumers with vertically heterogeneous tastes. There is a unique subscrip-tion equilibrium. On the other hand, when carriers offer termination-specific prices, peer effects have a substantial impact on the equilibrium. Because of the network externalities created by incompatibility, there might be multiple stable equilibria. Carriers may specialize to serve different consumer groups in a stable equilibrium even if they are identical ex ante. If carriers anticipate such an equilibrium, they would like to negotiate a high <b>interconnection</b> <b>fee</b> and offer intra-network discounts. ...|$|E

We study how different forms of interconnection and the competitive conditions of the market affect backbones ’ investments in network and peering point infrastructures. We show that networks and peering point capacities are equilibrium complements; increasing competition reduces capacity investments (under-investment), thus worsening the quality of service both with multilateral and bilateral peering. Under bilateral peering the inefficiency is less severe. Because of under-investment, welfare may be lower when the market is more competitive. We also show that asymmetries between backbones, which can {{take the form of}} unequal content distribution or product differentiation, may reduce under-investment and improve the quality of service.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{strategic}} commitments and network size on equilibrium interconnection fees set by competing local telecommunications networks. Our goal is to analyze how the regulatory rules of symmetric reciprocity and parity applied to interconnection charges affect the outcome of network competition. Symmetric reciprocity means that both networks charge the same price for termination, whereas parity holds when a network charges its customers as much as it charges customers of the other network for the same service. Assuming that each consumer does not subscribe to more than one network and given subscription decisions, we begin by analyzing a game of strategic symmetry where the two networks choose prices simultaneously. Second, we allow a dominant network to set its interconnection fees before the rival network can set its prices. This results in a price-squeeze on the rival network. Third, we show that the imposition of a rule of symmetric reciprocity on termination fees eliminates the strategic power of the first mover. When this rule is imposed, at equilibrium one network chooses to set the common <b>interconnection</b> <b>fee</b> at cost, and prices for final services are lower than in the two previously-analyzed games without symmetric reciprocity. Moreover, prices under symmetric reciprocity obey the parity principle. In the long run, consumers subscribe to one of the two networks. Typically, there is a multiplicity of equilibria in the subscription game, including corner equilibria, where all consumers subscribe to the same network, resulting in monopoly. However, when the rule of symmetric reciprocity is imposed, corner equilibria are eliminated. Thus, the rule symmetric reciprocity reduces the strategic asymmetry in local telecommunications networks and increases welfare. ...|$|E
40|$|MBA thesis - WBSIn recent years, the {{cellular}} industry {{has seen a}} massive growth in terms of providing cell phone services to people {{in different parts of}} the world including South Africa. This technology has made the world a smaller place to live in and has allowed people to communicate with anyone anywhere in the world for both joyous moments and emergencies. At the same time, there are claims that cellular towers in very close proximity to residential areas affect people negatively by causing ailments such as headaches and even cancer. The impact of regulation changes for {{the cellular}} industry in South Africa has caused much debate recently. This debate has been around the high interconnection charges that operators charge subscribers for calls to other networks. Mobile Virtual Network Operators are thriving mainly because of these high <b>interconnection</b> <b>fees,</b> their bulk buying power as well as one-sided regulations that are favourable to them. The objective of this research report is to evaluate the impact of recent regulation changes on South African cell phone consumers. The research is based mainly on four regulations in different areas of the cellular industry. These are the reduction in <b>interconnection</b> <b>fees,</b> the deregulation of infrastructure based on Telkom’s monopoly in the market, the spectrum allocation for new market players and the enforcement of service level agreements by ICASA based on licensing conditions. Twenty in-depth Interviews were conducted with various cell phone users from the various South African cell phone companies in order to obtain data for the research. This included seven different individuals who are using cell phone services from more than one service providers. Interview data was content analysed to see how the change in regulations has impacted cell phone users in South Africa and how the industry can improve the affordability of cell phone services in South Africa. Researcher’s key findings are that reforms in South African telecommunication sectors have been slow leading to poor competition in South African Cellular industry. Thus ICASA failed to improve the cell phone affordability for cell phone users in South Africa in the past. However, in recent past ICASA has taken right steps in right direction to improve the overall cell phone consumer experience in South Africa by opening up frequency spectrum for new market players, allowing all cell phone operators and Neotel to rollout transmission network, enforcing reduction in <b>interconnection</b> <b>fees</b> between the cell phone operators and fixed line operators as well as implementing service level agreement with cell phone operators’ on behalf of cell phone consumers...|$|R
40|$|When two {{networks}} interconnect, one network may {{value the}} con-nection {{more than the}} other. In an unregulated environment, the direction of payment for interconnection depends on whether there are increasing or decreasing marginal returns to network size. If users face decreasing marginal returns to network size, a small network ben-efits more from interconnection than a large network. Assuming that pricing between networks reflects this asymmetry, large networks can charge smaller ones for interconnection. Network mergers can result in higher <b>interconnection</b> <b>fees</b> for non-merging networks. Conditions for disconnection are examined. Despite the increasing value of net-work size, a large network may disconnect, either to recruit members of the disconnected network or, surprisingly, to shrink aggregate net-work size.

40|$|Abstract — Users and {{providers}} increasingly disagree on what Denial of Service (DoS) is.

We concentrate on mechanisms that might be used in one particular area, voice over IP (VoIP). We start evaluating them under the different aspects, including their cost, political suitability and the likelihood for countermeasures to succeed. We expect that this will give both sides better insight on their options and plea for peace, hopefully in an attempt to avoid and open war. I...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{strategic}} management consequences of technology development. Business policy considerations are predicated on the overall assumption that the multiplication of broadband telecommunication networks, capable of delivering both voice and data bits of information, has led telephone companies into a competitive situation where they are compelled to decrease their <b>interconnection</b> <b>fees.</b> All over the world there is an observable trend towards a cornucopia of networks and a glut of bandwidth. This means that legislation putting a cap on connection fees will only conserve a business situation that is gone long ago. Browsing the classical literature on telecommunication regulation, this study on business policy argues that {{instead of waiting for}} legislation - that is far too late to orient companies what to do policy-wise with the imminent new market situation -, wireless carriers should rather start emphasising the design of new, value-added services. Such a change of emphasis - turning away from the provision of connectivity alone - can help them achieve some added value and remain in business. Otherwise, they may soon follow the path of a slow corporate funeral following their wired brethren...|$|R
40|$|We {{know that}} several {{chemicals}} {{can be combined}} to form explosives. Therefore, {{we do not want}} these to end up in airplanes together. Similarly, in the architecture of complex systems, it is often possible to combine the results of several system services to acquire illegitimate benefits or disrupt operation. For example, in what is called simboxing, telephone services are purchased from different providers, and a composite service is set up which redirects incoming calls to the service purchased from the target provider, bypassing <b>interconnection</b> <b>fees.</b> Due to their complex nature, such attacks are extremely hard to predict and prevent. This paper provides a first systematic description and classification of the phenomenon of system abuse by service composition, as well as an analysis to identify the most common types of attacks in the design phase. We employ attack trees to express ways to achieve the goal of obtaining a service at a cost lower than the regular amount charged. We use the purchase of railway tickets as a running example, where the atomic services are the rights to travel between two directly adjacent stations. These can potentially be composed in various ways to travel cheaper, for example where there are stations A, B, and C on a railway line, and a single ticket from B to A via C is cheaper than a return ticket from B to C. Our method provides the foundations for systematically discovering such issues. Infrastructures, Systems and ServicesTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|R
40|$|Calling {{mobile phones}} {{tends to be}} far more {{expensive}} than calling subscribers connected to fixed lines. The reason for this discrepancy is rooted in the currently rather over-priced <b>interconnection</b> <b>fees</b> in the mobile sector. In order to find some explanations and to address this problem more carefully in the future, this paper tries to present and assess the technical, economic and legal framework of mobile telecommunications. Since interconnection may be of rising importance in a future of multiple communication networks, this paper sets out a clear economic understanding of interconnection as well as the relevant rules of the current as well as the future legal framework on European Community level (section C.). Thereafter, a section on pricing issues (section D.) points out the risk of collusion in mobile interconnection. Since issues of price regulation tend to be controversial in the entire communications sector but often do not distinguish between onesided access and mutual interconnection, a general description of price regulation methods is provided before conclusions for the appropriate method for interconnection are drawn. Although this paper’s focus is as far as possible on two-way interconnection, the general issues of this section sometimes draw attention to one-sided access as well, in order to provide a more complete view of the pricing problematic. Finally, regulatory practices at national level, which contribute to continuing high price levels for calls to mobile networks, and their consequences are shown up (section E.) ...|$|R

In case of linear and non-linear prices the access fee might still act as the instrument of collusion, but only if a side-payment is permitted which is generally welfare decreasing. Moreover, in contrast with the European regulatory framework, the access fee on the basis of termination cost might not necessarily be a socially preferable solution. cost asymmetry, brand loyalty, imperfect competition, network <b>interconnection,</b> access <b>fee...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} has {{provided}} an in-depth comparative review of policy approaches to network interconnection in China and Hong Kong SAR, both vertically and horizontally. These {{have been in}} sharp contrast, {{due to differences in}} the regulatory frameworks. Vertically, the interconnection policy in China has experienced a revolutionary leap forward before and after the establishment of the quasi-independent regulator - the Ministry of Information Industry (MII). The affiliation of China Telecom with the former Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) had led to above-cost <b>interconnection</b> <b>fees,</b> protracted negotiations and unfair technical arrangements. As a result, political intervention over interconnection has been frequently requested. The different market position of China Unicom before and after the establishment of the MII has shown that an ineffective regulatory framework is perhaps the largest competitive barrier for new entrants. Horizontally, the controversial status of the former MPT in China and the completely independent status of OFTA in Hong Kong SAR have led to differing levels of regulatory perseverance in liberalising the telecommunications sector, and, in consequence, different approaches in dealing with network interconnections. The less-problematic experience in Hong Kong SAR demonstrates how important an independent regulatory agency is for a secure and healthy competitive market. OFTA's cost-oriented and market-driven principles on network interconnection pricing have, to a certain extent, prevented the occurrence of market distortion, while its transparent guidelines on interconnection have guaranteed the fairness and effectiveness in implementing network interconnection. If OFTA had in close affiliation to any of the operators, it would likely not have been possible for it to have taken this regulatory approach in the past few years. Clearly, an effective regulatory framework {{is one of the most}} critical factors in facilitating network interconnection, and in creating a truly competitive market. One of the lessons to be learned from this case study is that the affiliation of the incumbent operator with the regulator can place new entrants on a path to financial loss and frustration. Therefore, it seems timely for international organisations such as the ITU and the WTO to strengthen their stance in encouraging member states to ensure the independent status of their national regulators. Moreover, in countries where an independent regulator is still to be established, certain international standards over technical aspects of network interconnection, such as points of interconnection, traffic routing, signalling and quality of interconnection, might prove to be helpful...|$|R
40|$|For about 15 {{years the}} {{telecommunication}} sector, erstwhile an inert sector dominated by national monopolies, has been undergoing a dramatic transformation towards {{a competitive market}} for information services. The potential for explosive growth – long-term scenarios expect {{as much as a}} fourfold increase in real terms up to 2010 – has moved this sector into the center of economic policy making. Deregulation efforts attempt to eliminate the negative effects associated with a monopoly, by stimulating competition and regulating the dominant seller in the market, so that the dominant firm can no longer exploit the market power that remains even after liberalization. In practically all "deregulated" countries this strategy was implemented with the goal of stimulating competition and of securing a measure of fair competition through regulatory measures. There are various approaches to fostering competition: in the U. S., the dominant supplier (AT&T) was split up into regional companies, providing local telephone service, and a company operating in the long-distance segment. In the U. K., the dominant supplier was subjected to competition and then privatized. Aside from the market structures, several features are of central importance for supporting a well-functioning competitive market: access to the net of the dominant supplier, <b>interconnection</b> <b>fees,</b> numbering, and the universal service. Regulation of the dominant supplier is of decisive importance for the success of a liberalization drive. A basic distinction can be made between a "rate of return" regulation and the setting of maximum prices. In recent years, the regulation systems have tended towards instituting price caps because they offer the regulated enterprise a much greater incentive to introduce innovations, to increase efficiency, and to cut costs. The impetus for a reform of the Austrian telecommunication system came from outside of Austria. The need to adjust follows from the GATT treaty – which contains a chapter on services: General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and Related Instruments – and the reception into Austrian law of EU laws through the EEA and Austria's accession to the EU. Austria's activities in this regard were limited by the desire to institute only the absolutely necessary adaptations at the latest date possible. The central problems are the draft of the bill regulating the structure of the postal service and a regulatory framework for the dominant supplier. Both items will be of decisive influence {{on the development of the}} telecommunication sector in the medium term: the decisions now taken will determine whether Austria will or will not have competition in this sector. Given the huge reform deficit, Austria's Postal Service will have to undertake massive adjustments to cope with the new challenges. Austria's attractiveness as a location of economic activity will depend to a large extent on the success of this reform. Liberalisierung und Regulierung im Telekommunikationssektor.
