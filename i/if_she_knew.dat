Shortly after graduating, she pursued {{a degree in}} criminal justice at Illinois State University, doubtful of her ability {{to make a career}} as a professional singer. However, after two years of college, she left to pursue a music career, as a backing vocalist for other artists such as Monica. In late 1999, 19-year-old Williams met Destiny's Child band members Beyoncé and Kelly Rowland in the lobby of an Atlanta hotel. Months later Beyoncé asked an acquaintance <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> anyone who could sing for the possible spot with the group and was referred to Michelle.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to her linguistic abilities, Genie's nonverbal communication continued to excel. She invented her own system of gestures and pantomimed certain words {{as she said}} them, and also acted out events which she could not express in language. Initially she would only draw pictures if someone asked her to, but during her stay with the Riglers she began to use drawings to communicate if she could not explain something in words. In addition to her own drawings she often used pictures from magazines to relate to daily experiences, and for reasons the scientists never determined especially did so after encountering things that frightened her. Some time during mid-1972 Marilyn observed that a magazine picture of a wolf sent Genie into a terror, after which the Riglers asked Genie's mother <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> a possible cause for this reaction; she then informed them {{that her husband had}} acted like a dog to intimidate Genie, making the underlying reason for her fear apparent to the scientists for the first time.|$|E
500|$|Irene Kacandes, {{professor}} of German Studies and Comparative Literature at Dartmouth College, calls Rosa's internal monologues apostrophes, or [...] "intrapsychic witnessing", in which [...] "a character {{witnesses to the}} self about the character's own experience". Kacandes points out that Rosa believes {{she would not be}} able to internalise anything <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> someone was listening. In an apostrophe addressed to Conrad, Rosa remarks, [...] "If you knew I was talking to you I wouldn't be able to talk". But because Rosa is not vocalising her monologues, no one can hear her, and she is able to proceed with her self-analysis unhindered. Kacandes says [...] "Rosa imagines an interlocutor and then occupies that place herself." ...|$|E
500|$|Criticism {{was also}} raised {{regarding}} the relatively few convictions. Despite several people's admissions to police that they physically attacked Leigh at the party, only Wilson {{was charged with}} assault, and the adult who admitted to supplying her with alcohol prior to the party was never charged. NC1 admitted to having sex with another under-age girl at the party, though he was not charged with that offence. With {{the exception of the}} charges against Webster that were dropped without explanation, nobody was ever charged with raping or sexually assaulting Leigh in spite of the presence of graphic forensic evidence of genital injuries. During a report on Radio National, Leigh's mother said that when she asked Detective Chaffey why others were not being charged, he asked her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> [...] "how much it costs to run an investigation".|$|E

500|$|Anna and {{her sister}} began to {{frequent}} nightclubs in the St. Louis and East St. Louis areas around this time. At Club Manhattan, a nightclub in the East St. Louis area, she first saw Ike Turner and his band, the Kings of Rhythm, perform. Anna {{was impressed by the}} band's music and of Ike's talent, claiming the bandleader's music put her [...] "into a trance." [...] Anna felt the urge to sing on stage with Ike's band despite the fact that few women had ever sung with him. One night in 1956, 16-year-old Anna was given a microphone by Kings of Rhythm drummer Gene Washington during an intermission. Upon hearing her sing, Ike asked her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> more songs, she was allowed to sing that night, becoming a guest vocalist from then on. Through this period, Ike taught her the points of voice control and performance. Her first studio recording was in 1958, singing background, under the name [...] "Little Ann", on the Ike Turner song, [...] "Box Top", alongside singer Carlson Oliver.|$|E
500|$|The video {{received}} mostly {{positive response}} from the journalist and critics. Jamie Portman from The Daily Gazette felt that the clip could be [...] "vulnerable to charges of being blatantly provocative in its calculated blending of sex and religion". David Rosenthal from The Spokesman-Review found the video as [...] "visually stunning"; however, Edna Gundersen from USA Today {{did not understand the}} media mayhem behind the clip. She pointed out that [...] "Madonna is a good girl in the video. She saves someone. What is the big deal?..." [...] Among music critics, Phil Kloer from Record-Journal felt that whether one condemns the video as racist or not, [...] "It's condemnable {{on the face of it}} because it exploits a symbol of evil [...] in order to sell records." [...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Chris Willman complimented the video for its portrayal of a love song, rather than blasphemy. He was more interested in the stigmata presented in the clip. Taraborrelli described his thoughts: [...] "Madonna danced with such abundance in , as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that she was about to cause a commotion, and couldn't wait to see how it would unfold." ...|$|E

An insider from EastEnders told Inside Soap that Roxy and AJ are both looking for fun and they [...] "hit it off" [...] because she loves [...] "a man who can make her laugh and AJ definitely ticks that box." [...] They added that they have [...] "great chemistry" [...] but said that as Roxy is sidetracked by another man, [...] "AJ will have to fight [...] for her affections" [...] if he wants her. An insider also told the Daily Star that the two [...] "can't keep their hands off each other" [...] and [...] "Roxy is more than up for it." [...] They added that [...] "Zainab would go mental <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> what they were up to under her roof and {{it remains to be seen}} whether they can get away with it. Roxy is the last person who Zainab would want AJ to hook up with. [...] Even Masood could not defend his brother this time as he had been pretty disrespectful." [...] Digital Spy also noted chemistry between AJ and Roxy, saying they [...] "clearly enjoy each other's company". Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror said the relationship between Roxy and AJ is [...] "played for laughs", contrasting with Roxy's relationship with Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd).|$|E

She continued to say herself and label boss Simon Cowell discussed the possibility of Lewis recording a discussed cover version. Lewis cited her reason for wishing to record her own version as being a [...] "massive" [...] fan of rock bands, and that she wanted to put a [...] "different spin on it". When asked the question of <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> what Gallagher thought about her version, she replied saying that she had not spoken to them and that she did not know if they had listened to her version. Originally written solely by Gallagher, Lewis's cover version was produced by Steve Robson. Both Robson and Lewis were the vocal producers on [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out". It was engineered by Richard Flack, who was assisted in the process by vocal engineer Seth Waldmann. It was mixed by Jeremy Wheatly at Twenty-One Studios, located in London, England. A range of instrumentalists were bought in for the song; Karl Brazil played the drums, while Luke Potashnick provided guitar. John Garrison played the bass and Robson the piano. The London Session Orchestra performed the strings on [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" [...] and it was arranged by Will Malone, while the choir was organised and arranged by Lawrence Johnson.

500|$|During {{their second}} meeting, Cisneros asked Martínez {{to cast a}} spell on Fischer. Martínez said {{she was unable to}} do that, and Cisneros grew angry and left the store. A few days later, Cisneros called Martínez and asked her to pray for Fischer to get back {{together}} with Cristina. Cisneros returned for a third visit to Martínez's shop in October 1992, and asked her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> anyone willing to beat up Fischer. By winter, she changed her request and asked to have Fischer killed, offering US$3,000 to the person who would do it. According to Martínez, Cisneros told her that Fischer had raped Cristina and was telling his classmates at St. Joe that he had sex with her. However, Cristina said she never had sex with him. Although Garza assured Martínez that he would find someone to carry out the job, he kept calling and visiting her to discuss his marriage problems. Under pressure from Cisneros, Martínez would often interrupt the sessions with Garza to remind him of the plan. Garza lied to Martínez on several occasions telling her he had someone lined up to kill Fischer. Cisneros contacted Martínez in November to ask her why the job had not been done. Martínez responded that she did not know when the murder would be carried out. Garza eventually divorced his wife on January 4, 1993, and kept calling Martínez to tell her his personal problems had not been fixed. On January 9, he traveled to Brownsville from San Antonio to talk about the divorce, and Martínez reminded him that a client of hers wanted Fischer dead. She told him again that if he facilitated Fischer's murder, Garza's personal problems would be solved.|$|E

Novakovic said Natasha would be [...] "devastated" [...] <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> what had happened and that she would not let Andrew and Summer off lightly. Andrew tells Natasha {{that he is going to}} business meeting, but he meets Summer instead. While they are together in Summer's house, a fire breaks out. Natasha sees the smoke and calls her father and the emergency services before entering the house to rescue Summer, unaware Andrew is also there. Novakovic explained Natasha's ordeal: [...] "Natasha is pulled from the fire by her dad, Michael. Andrew and Summer are rescued separately, and Natasha has no idea of the reason why Andrew was in the house - he was cheating on her with Summer!" [...] After the rescue, Natasha has to come to terms with the fact she will be scarred from a burn she sustains on her neck. Novakovic said that it is a [...] "big deal" [...] for Natasha, as she aspires to be a model and this could ruin her chances. Novakovic also opines that Summer wants nothing more than to be with Andrew, but how can she take him when Natasha tried to save her? Novakovic believed Natasha was blasé to their feelings adding [...] "Deep down, I think Natasha knows that there's something going on, but she doesn't want to admit it to herself.
