40|$|A nuclear {{material}} detection system (NMDS) based on neutron / -ray hybrid {{approach has been}} proposed for the container <b>inspection</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> ports [1, 2]. While neutron {{is to be used}} for a fast pre-screening, quasi-monochromatic -ray beam from the laser Compton scattering (LCS) source will be used for an isotope identification on the precise inspection of the cargoes. Nuclear resonance fluorescence method is going to be employed for the isotope identification because of its superiority in high selectivity and in high penetration capability through the shielding objects. In the system a high energy electron beam of good quality is required for LCS. A 220 -MeV racetrack microtron (RTM) {{is one of the most}} promising candidates as an electron source for such the practical use. Suppose a few nC/bunch of electrons are accelerated, space charge effects (SCEs) on the RTM are investigated using the tracking code Parmela [3]...|$|E

On 29 June, the frigate sailed for her fourth and longest Mediterranean cruise. Following her Atlantic crossing, the ship arrived in Malaga on 9 July. After a brief run to Naples, she received on board Admiral H. E. Shear, Commander in Chief, Allied Forces, Southern Europe.|$|R
50|$|She was {{an early}} example of a screw-propelled vessel, though she also possessed a fully {{functional}} sail rig, and her screw could be feathered when she was required to travel under sail. This operation could be conducted within 7 minutes from stopping the engines. The screw could also be raised for <b>inspection</b> while <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> if required. During trials she {{turned out to be}} a fine sailer, achieving a speed of 10 kn.|$|R

Castro, furious that the Soviets had agreed to remove missiles without his knowledge, categorically rejected any UN inspectors, although he did return the pilot's body. The <b>inspection</b> was done <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> by US reconnaissance aircraft and warships. The crisis was resolved and a war between superpowers was averted.|$|R

5000|$|On 30 November, Alger sailed for Bermuda and shakedown. She {{returned}} to Philadelphia for post-shakedown availability, then {{headed for the}} Caribbean on 15 January 1944, and arrived at Trinidad on 21 January. There, she was assigned to Task Group (TG) 42.5 and departed on the 31st in the screen of a convoy bound for Recife, Brazil. While en route, Alger collided with a merchantman and sustained slight damage to her bow. However, she continued on to Brazil and reached Recife on 14 February. Upon her arrival there, the ship was assigned to Task Group 41.5 for patrol duty along the Brazilian coast which she carried out until 1 June. On that day, Alger departed Recife to escort a convoy to Trinidad. She reached that island on 8 June and then sailed back to Recife with another convoy. On 17 July, Alger joined the screen of the escort carrier [...] and sailed for anti-submarine warfare exercises {{off the coast of}} Brazil. She then resumed patrol duty and continued that work through most of November. Alger rendezvoused <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> {{on the last day of}} the month with Task Group 42.3 and escorted a convoy to Rio de Janeiro. On 28 December, the ship departed Recife to escort another convoy to Trinidad but {{returned to}} Recife on 30 January 1945. The next day, Alger was relieved of operational duties in preparation for her transfer to the government of Brazil on loan. After various <b>inspections</b> and exercises <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> Alger departed Recife on 23 February and moored the same day at Natal, Brazil.|$|R
40|$|In Europe, {{species of}} the {{nematode}} genus Bursaphelenchus have been known and studied {{for a long time}} (Fuchs 1937; Ruhm 1956). Earlier, except from a purely biological or ecological point of view, no particular interest was paid to this group of mycophagous nematodes. In 1979, however, a study conducted in southwestern France showed that the nematode Bursaphelenchus lignicolous was associated with declining pines (Baujard et al. 1979). This report caused alarm in Europe, since B. lignicolous is a synonym of B. xylophilus; the nematode in question was later identifi ed as B. mucronatus (De Guiran et al. 1986), which had been described as a new species that year. In 1984, a shipment of wood from North America to Finland was found to carry the pine wood nematode (PWN), B. xylophilus (Rautapaa 1986). This important interception prompted European authorities to develop more rigorous <b>inspections</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> ports, and in particular of wood products coming from North America. However, no equivalent emphasis was placed on such products coming from East Asia. Between 1996 and 1999, an EU-funded project (RISKBURS) resulted in an updated survey of the Bursaphelenchus species in Europe (European Communities 2003). For an updated situation on the species distribution in the EU, see Braasch (2001). In 1999, the PWN, the causal agent of pine wilt disease, was fi rst detected in the European Union (EU), in Portugal (Mota 2004; Mota et al. 1999), and this immediately prompted several national and EU governments to assess the extent of the nematode’s distribution, and to restrict B. xylophilus and its insect vector (Monochamus galloprovincialis) to an area with a 30 -km radius in the Setúbal Peninsula, 20 km south of Lisbon (Rodrigues 2007). The origin of the population of PWN found in Portugal remains unknown, although recent research indicates that it originated from Eastern Asia (Vieira et al. 2007). Several hypotheses have been suggested on how it entered the country, namely from North America or from Japan or China. World trade of wood products such as timber, wooden crates, and palettes {{play an important role in}} the potential dissemination of the PWN (Evans et al. 1996). In fact, human activities involving the movement of wood products may be the single most important factor in PWN spread. Despite the dedicated and concerted actions of government agencies, both the PWN and pine wilt disease continue to spread. In 2006 in Portugal, forestry and plant quarantine authorities (DGRF and DGPC) announced a new strategy for managing the problem. The plan is to establish a phytosanitary strip, 3 -km wide, devoid of Pinus pinaster, surrounding the affected area, for the control and ultimately the eradication of the nematode, under the coordination of the national program for the control of the PWN (DGRF 2006). Research on the bioecology of the nematode and its insect vector, new detection methods, for example, involving real-time PCR, tree ecology and pathology, and control methods, has been underway since 1999. As well there are two major ongoing projects for the European Union (EU) : PHRAME ([URL] nsf/ByUnique/INFD- 63 KGEF) and PortCheck ([URL] index. cfm). This research has been instrumental in helping to understand the scientifi c aspects of pine wilt disease. The objective of the present paper is to highlight the progress made in Portugal and the EU. International agreements (GATT, WTO) and sharing of scientifi c information is of paramount importance for achieving effective control of the nematode and its vector, and in turn protection of our forest ecosystems and forest economies...|$|R
