The degree of a queen’s {{polyandry}} is positively associ-ated with measures of her colony’s fitness, and observed distributions of mating number are evolutionary optima balancing risks of mating flights against benefits to the colony. Effective mating numbers as high as 40 have been documented, begging the question of the upper bounds of this behavior that can be expected to confer colony benefit. In this study we used instrumental insemination to create three classes of queens with exaggerated range of poly-andry – 15, 30, or 60 drones.

Our results are consistent with two hypotheses that posit conditions that reward such high expressions of polyandry: (1) a queen may mate with many males in order to promote beneficial non-addi-tive genetic interactions among subfamilies, and (2) a queen may mate with many males in order to capture a large number of rare alleles that regulate resistance to pathogens and parasites in a breeding population.

40|$|Abstract approved: D. Micha 1 Burgett The {{relationship}} of the parasitic brood mite, Euvarroa sinhai Delfinado and Baker to the dwarf honey bee, Apis florea F. was investigated in northern Thailand. The population density of this mite on adult bees from various stages of A. florea colony development were determined. The mite density from queenright colonies following swarming, was higher than colonies examined pre-swarming and other stages of colony development. Swarming tends to effect the density of Euvarroa mites within a colony by leaving most of the mites in the mother colonies, thus reducing mite load in the swarm. This behavior {{is one of the}} effective defense mechanisms of A. florea against parasites. Normally, prevalence infestation rate of Euvarroa mites in <b>drone</b> <b>brood</b> from queenright A. florea colonies was low and varied among colonies. The distribution of this mite on <b>drone</b> <b>brood</b> is aggregated.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the reproductive biology of V. destructor in Africanized honeybees (AHB) in Central American conditions, specifically in Costa Rica. Attention {{was paid to}} mite fertility and production of viable female mites in worker and <b>drone</b> <b>brood</b> cells. Other reproduction parameters, like fecundity, production of only immature offspring, production of only female or only male offspring and no reproduction at all are discussed. Furthermore, results on mite population dynamics and its influence in the colony condition are presented. We hypothesized that, due to the preference of mites to invade <b>drone</b> <b>brood</b> to reproduce, {{a high proportion of}} the mite reproduction in Africanized bees should occur in drone cells. Mite fertility for varroa infesting worker brood cells in AHB in Costa Rica, ranged between 69 % and 76 %. So the number of fertile varroa mites in worker brood was higher than what other studies have reported for AHB in Brazil. Nevertheless, factors that limited varroa reproduction in worker brood were the non-reproducing mites, foundresses that produced only immature stages, foundresses that produced one adult sex, mortality of emerging mites and the absence of the male we found in a considerable percentage of worker cells. The combined effects of these factors results in less than 30 % of the foundress mites producing viable female in Africanized colonies. The absence of the male in worker cells reduces the production of viable daughters. We observed in artificial cells containing infested worker brood in Africanized bees that in a considerable number of cases the first egg (that is generally male) was disturbed and damaged when the prepupa molts into a pupa. We consider that the absence of male in a considerable number of worker cells could be hypothesized by this effect. The low number of viable females produced by foundress mites found in worker brood cells of AHB colonies, seems insufficient to explain the occurrence of viruses in severely infested colonies and the mite infestation increase in the colonies through the year. Due to the preference of mites to infest <b>drone</b> <b>brood</b> to reproduce, we compared the reproductive rate of V. destructor in worker and drone cells of AHB colonies. We found that mite fertility was similar between worker and <b>drone</b> <b>brood.</b> However, {{one of the most significant}} differences in mite reproduction was the higher percentage of mites producing viable offspring in drone cells compared to worker cells. The number of eggs and viable females produced per foundress mites was also higher in <b>drone</b> <b>brood.</b> Furthermore, a high percentage of the non-reproducing mites in worker brood produced offspring when they were transferred to <b>drone</b> <b>brood.</b> This indicates that <b>drone</b> <b>brood</b> cells proved to be better suited for mite reproduction than worker brood cells and that brood type has an influence in the reproductive success of varroa mites in Africanized bees. The number of viable female offspring produced by invading mother mites depends, in part, upon the type of cell the mite enters, whether it is worker or drone Because in tropical conditions worker brood rearing takes place all year-round, varroa can completes many reproductive cycles. So the number of mite reproductive cycles that occurs in worker brood through the year and the successful reproduction of varroa mites in <b>drone</b> <b>brood</b> are significant factors related with the mite population growth determined in AHB colonies in Costa Rica...|$|E

Density of mites in the worker cells was significant positive correlated with those on adult bees (r= 0. 75). The second egg laid by the parental female were male in worker cells or drone cells, while the rest of eggs in the other egg laying sequence were females. The female to male sex ratio of progeny was 11 : 4. Developmental periods of the female and the male were studied from mites living in the capped worker and drone cells. Frequency of Varroa mites parasitized on abdominal sternum was higher than those on other portions of adult bees. The chances of mites occurring on the combs of the bee colonies to the queen egg-laying pattern was positive correlated. In other words, among all measured areas, the highest chances of mites occured in the brood cells was in the central and the lower portion of the comb. Frequency distribution of mites among bee spaces showed no different significance, however, a higher frequence distribution measurement of mites was observed at the central portion of bee spaces. Mites reared with three different artificial rearing cells indicated a higher successful rate of development of progeny in centrifugal rearing cells with <b>drone</b> <b>brood.</b> Adult mites were only obtained from the acrylic rearing cells with <b>drone</b> <b>brood,</b> but a showed lower successful rate. 周年蜂蟹密度於春、秋兩季各發生一高峰。雄蜂幼蟲房內蟹之出現頻 率、密度均高於工蜂房，且較多之子代完成發育。封蓋工蜂房及成蜂體上 之蟹密度間，呈顯著之正相關關係(r= 0. 75) 。封蓋工蜂及雄蜂房內， 每房親代雌密度及其每雌子代蟹密度之間，呈顯著負相關關係(r=- 0. 96 及 r=- 0. 80) 。於封蓋工蜂或雄蜂房內所產之第 2 子代為雄性， 餘皆為雌性子代；其子代之雌雄性比例為 11 ： 4 。雌、雄蟹各發育期於 封蓋工蜂及雄蜂房內均已測得。成蜂體上之蟹以腹部腹板之外寄生頻度 最高 ； 於蜂群內巢脾上之分佈頻度與蜂王產卵習性成正相關，即巢脾中 央偏下方之封蓋幼蟲房內之出現機率最高。蜂路間對蟹之出現頻度影響 不顯著，但以中央部位之蜂路出現頻度較高。三種人工飼育房飼育蜂蟹 結果，顯示雄蜂離心飼育房可獲較佳之發育成功率，而雄蜂壓克力飼育房 可獲子代成，但其成功率仍低...|$|E
40|$|In six {{colonies of}} Apis cerana the queen was removed and {{occurrence}} of egg-laying by workers was studied. Three colonies had brood of all stages and were thus allowed to build emergency queen cells and to rear queens. In three other colonies no young brood to build emergency queen cells was left (hopelessly queenless), but older brood was present. Workers started laying within {{two to three}} days after removal of the queen, both in the colonies rearing queens and in the hopelessly queenless colonies. Four to five days after removal of the queen mass egg-laying by workers occurred in five of the six colonies. These eggs partly developed into capped <b>drone</b> <b>brood.</b> Thus, A. cerana workers may produce a substantial number of drones during short periods of queenlessness, even when new queens are reared simultaneously...|$|E

It {{is not known}} how pollen deprivation during the larval development of drones might affect their reproductive quality. This study investigated ejaculation ability and semen quality in drones reared in colonies with limited (LP) and unlimited (ULP) access to pollen. Access to pollen was limited by pollen traps. <b>Drone</b> <b>brood</b> rearing was not instantly abandoned in colonies with limited access to pollen. Colonies from the LP group reared drones with smaller mass, which ejaculated in fewer numbers and released smaller amounts of semen.

40|$|Various {{modifications}} of techniques for rearing diploid <b>drone</b> <b>brood</b> were tested on 13 900 low-survivallarvae (50 % female, 50 % diploid drone) from inbred queens. Moderate larval survival was obtained after rearing the larvae in an incubator for varying lengths oftime and then transferring them to worker cells, but no adult drones emerged.

Sex alleles homozygoty was measured based on Ruttner (1988) and Tarpy and Page (2002) methods. The total area of worker brood area, stored pollen, and <b>drone</b> <b>brood</b> area were measured on the combs. The whole extracted honey weight and remaining honey in the combs were evaluated as honey production of colonies.

40|$|Factors {{influencing}} {{reproduction of}} the parasitic mite Varroa jacobsoni have become a central theme of honey bee pathology. In {{large parts of the}} world the mite has made it impossible for colonies of the honey bee Apis mellifera to survive if no measures of treatment are applied [1]. Originally a parasite of the Eastern honey bee A. cerana, the mite was detected in colonies of A. mellifera only less than 4 decades ago [2]. A. cerana colonies are not damaged by V. jacobsoni because several factors prevent the build-up of a large mite population [3]. The most important factor is that in colonies of A. cerana the parasite, which can reproduce only in capped brood cells, reproduces exclusively in <b>drone</b> <b>brood</b> cells while in colonies of A. mellifera it reproduces in worker brood cells as well [4]. In cold, temperate, and Mediterranean climates the mite population grows exponentially until the colony collapses, due mainly to a high percentage of bees damaged by V. jacobsoni during their pupal development [5]...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 The {{number of}} drones and genetic {{diversity}} among drones are essential components to a well mated queen. Varroa destructor preferentially parasitizes <b>drone</b> <b>brood,</b> and {{is thought to}} be responsible for the loss of feral populations that once provided additional drones for honey bee mating areas. It is necessary to use miticides (e. g. coumaphos) in managed colonies to control V. destructor. Little is known about the sublethal effects of these compounds, which are directly introduced into the hive. In response to growing concerns about the successful mating of honey bee queens, drone honey bees were exposed to coumaphos, during drone development. Sperm and seminal vesicles were sampled among drones that were exposed to coumaphos and drones that were not exposed to coumaphos, but were parasitized by Varroa destructor. There were no significant differences found between the two treatments in terms of seminal vesicle size and sperm numbers. These results indicate that drones parasitized by V. destructor have similar sperm quantities as drones exposed to coumaphos...|$|E
40|$|Kin {{selection}} theory {{predicts that}} honeybee (Apis mellifera) workers should largely refrain from producing their own offspring, as the workers collectively have higher inclusive fitness if they rear {{the sons of}} their mother, the queen. Studies that have quantified levels of ovary activation and reproduction among workers have largely supported this prediction. In contrast we show here that the overall contribution of workers to male (drone) production is 4. 2 %, nearly 40 times higher than is generally reported, and is highest during reproductive swarming, when an average of 6. 2 % of the males genotyped are worker-produced. Similarly, workers in our samples were 100 {{times more likely to}} have active ovaries than previously assumed. Worker reproduction is seasonally influenced and peaks when colonies are rearing new queens. Not all worker subfamilies contribute equally to reproduction. Instead, certain subfamilies are massively over-represented in <b>drone</b> <b>brood.</b> By laying eggs within the period in which many colonies produce virgin queens, these rare worker subfamilies increase their direct fitness via their well-timed sons...|$|E
40|$|This paper covers {{measures}} of field colony strength, {{by which we}} mean population {{measures of}} adult bees and brood. There are generally two contexts in which an investigator wishes to measure colony strength: 1. {{at the beginning of}} a study as part of manipulations to produce uniform colonies and reduce experimental error and; 2. as response variables during or at the end of an experiment. Moreover, there are two general modes for measuring colony strength: 1. an objective mode which uses empirical measures and; 2. a subjective mode that relies on visual estimates by one or more observers. There is a third emerging mode for measuring colony strength; 3. computer-assisted digital image analysis. A final section deals with parameters that do not directly measure colony strength yet give important indicators of colony state: flight activity at the entrance; comb construction; and two proxy measures of colony fitness: production of queen cells and <b>drone</b> <b>brood.</b> How to conduct different types of experiments are described, including infectious dose, dose effects, course of infection and longevity tests...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis review {{considers}} how a {{honey bee}} colony optimally controls {{the timing and}} type of new comb construction. Optimal timing requires bees to balance the energy costs of construction with the opportunity costs of lacking storage space during nectar flows. They do so by conditioning the start of building on (1) the attainment of a fullness threshold, and (2) the availability of nectar. A dynamic optimization model has suggested that this rule is slightly suboptimal, but may compensate for this by its simplicity and generality. The emergence of this collective strategy from the decisions of individual bees is poorly understood, but recent experiments have {{cast doubt on the}} long-standing idea that building is triggered by increased distension of the crops of nest bees. Bees also regulate the relative amounts of drone and worker comb in their nests, with important consequences for their sex investment strategy. Regulation depends on the inhibitory effect of drone comb on further drone comb construction, mediated through a decentralized process requiring that workers have direct contact with the comb. Contact by the queen is not required, nor is the presence of <b>drone</b> <b>brood,</b> although the latter may enhance the strength of inhibition...|$|E
