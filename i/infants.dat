In Indonesia, information determinant factors of initiated breastmilk within 1 hour after <b>infant</b> birth are rare. Objective: to evaluate determinant factor of initiated breastmilk within 1 hour after <b>infant</b> birth. Methods: Data demography health survey 2007 (DHS 2007) was analyzed using multiple regression logistic. Result: The proportion initiated of breastmilk within 1 hour after <b>infant</b> birth is 45. 6 % for <b>infant</b> 0 - 11 months age, and 45. 9 % <b>infant</b> 12 - 23 months age. The proportion initiated breastmilk within 1 hour after birth <b>infant</b> in rural area lower than <b>infant</b> in urban area (44. 7 % and 46. 6 %). In the urban area, parity is determinant factor of initiated of breastmilk within 1 hour after <b>infant</b> birth controlling sex of <b>infant,</b> birthweight, mother age, work status, education level, and delivery health care and pregnancy health care. In the rural area, pregnancy health care is determinant factor of initiated of breastmilk within 1 hour after <b>infant</b> birth controlling sex of <b>infant,</b> birthweight, mother age, parity, work status, education level, and delivery health care. Conclusion: The proportion of initiated breastmilk within 1 hour after <b>infant</b> birth stilllow.   Keywords: ini ti ated breastmillk, parity and pregnancy health ca re </p...|$|R

5|$|Dyadic joint {{attention}} is a conversation-like behavior that individuals engage in.

5|$|From early on, {{children}} also assume that language {{is designed for}} communication. <b>Infants</b> treat communication as a cooperative process. Specifically, <b>infants</b> observe the principles of conventionality and contrast. According to conventionality, <b>infants</b> believe that for a particular meaning that they wish to convey, there is a term {{that everyone in the}} community would expect to be used. According to contrast, <b>infants</b> act according to the notion that differences in form mark differences in meaning. Children's attention to conventionality and contrast is demonstrated in their language use, even before the age of 2 years; they direct their early words towards adult targets, repair mispronunciations quickly if possible, ask for words to relate to the world around them, and maintain contrast in their own word use.|$|E

A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing at a place where it should not be. Older <b>infants</b> are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger <b>infants.</b> However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently.

5|$|As {{described}} in attachment theory, <b>infants</b> {{need to develop}} a relationship with a primary caregiver to achieve normal social and emotional development.

In addition to language development, joint attention serves the function of preparing <b>infants</b> for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint attention predict their social competence at 30 months of age. Anticipatory smiling (a low level form of joint attention involving smiling at an object then turning the smile to one's communicative partner) at 9 months positively predicts parent-rated social competence scores at 30 months in <b>infants.</b> Early joint attention abilities account for differences in social and emotional abilities in later life.|$|E

5|$|Family members {{contribute}} to pragmatic development in different ways. Fathers often act as secondary caregivers, and may know the child less intimately. Older siblings may lack {{the capacity to}} acknowledge the child's needs. As a result, both fathers and siblings may pressure children to communicate more clearly. They often challenge children to improve their communication skills, therefore preparing them to communicate with strangers about unfamiliar topics. Fathers have more breakdowns when communicating with <b>infants,</b> and spend less time focused on the same objects or actions as <b>infants.</b> Siblings are more directive and less responsive to <b>infants,</b> which motivates <b>infants</b> to participate in conversations with their older siblings. There are limitations to studies {{that focus on the}} influences of fathers and siblings, as most research is descriptive and correlational.

In 1988, 23 of the 50 states had a black <b>infant</b> mortality rate that was more than twice as large as its white <b>infant</b> mortality rate. This study assesses whether state-level structural variables relate differentially to states' black and white <b>infant</b> mortality rates. With the state as the unit of analysis, separate black (N = 34) and white (N = 50) multivariate models of <b>infant</b> mortality were produced and compared. The structural variables accounted for 57. 7 % of the variance in states' black <b>infant</b> mortality rates and 35. 2 % of the variance in states' white <b>infant</b> mortality rates. Proportion black, percent with bachelor's degree or higher, percent below poverty, and the index of dissimilarity each made a unique contribution to the black <b>infant</b> mortality model. Percent with bachelor's degree or higher was the only measure that made a significant unique contribution to the white <b>infant</b> mortality model. Thus, although both black and white <b>infant</b> mortality rates were higher in states with smaller percentages of the population having a bachelor's degree or higher, black <b>infant</b> mortality rates were also higher in states where proportionately more black persons lived, where there were higher levels of residential segregation in the urban areas, and, contrary to what was expected, where smaller percentages of the population lived below the poverty level.
