Hawkins, member of Johnson's second club, the Literary Club {{established}} 1764, resigned over a dispute with others of Johnson's circle. The relationship between Hawkins {{and the rest of}} Johnson's friends became so tense that many criticised Johnson for choosing Hawkins in 1784 as one of his executors for his will. However, within hours of Johnson's death, Thomas Cadell and William Strahan asked Hawkins to write a biography and an edition of Johnson's literary works.|$|E

In order to reduce these numbers, the surfaces of the devices used in these procedures have been altered in hopes to prevent {{the growth of the}} bacteria that leads to these infections. This has been achieved by coating titanium devices with an antiseptic combination of chlorhexidine and chloroxylenol. This antiseptic combination successfully prevents the growth of the five main organisms that cause medical related infections, which include Staphylococcus epidermidis, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans.|$|E

500|$|One more {{proposal}} which utilizes {{the high}} nuclear fission rate of 242mAm is a nuclear battery. Its design relies {{not on the}} energy of the emitted by americium alpha particles, but on their charge, that is the americium acts as the self-sustaining [...] "cathode". A single 3.2kg 242mAm charge of such battery could provide about 140kW of power over a period of 80 days. <b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> potential benefits, the current applications of 242mAm are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this particular nuclear isomer.|$|E
500|$|Loss {{of habitat}} because of {{agriculture}} has {{also contributed to}} its decline, though {{this is no longer}} as significant a factor because the rhinoceros only lives in one nationally protected park. Deteriorating habitats have hindered the recovery of rhino populations that fell victim to poaching. <b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> conservation efforts, the prospects for their survival are grim.

500|$|The {{asymmetrical}} {{structure of}} the game mostly received praise from critics. Vince Ingenito, from IGN, thought that the system was smart and has successfully delivered a unique multiplayer experience for players. He added {{that the system is}} tactically deep, and that the [...] "evolution" [...] mechanic saved it from being gimmicky. This was contradicted by Steven Strom of Ars Technica, who stated that the game overall was just a [...] "great gimmick and little else: something we'll play for a month or two, and not much longer"., [...] Evan Lahti, from PC Gamer, also commended the structure, and considered it the most compressed multiplayer experience since 2014's Titanfall. He added that such structure is something that the genre needs. Anthony LaBella, from Game Revolution, praised the asymmetrical idea. He added that the distant gameplay elements between Monsters and Hunters had successfully introduced Evolve to a broad audience. However, he noted that such a structure may become repetitive and boring for players after months of playthrough. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd also appreciated the structure, which he thought made every battle feel [...] "vicious and intense". However, Jeff Marchiafava, from Game Informer, thought that the structure felt limited, and that Evolve, <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> modes, had failed to offer enough variety and challenges to players. Nic Rowan, from Destructoid, thought that Evolve had presented some of the best moments he had had in a multiplayer game, but he felt that these moments are too far between.|$|E

For example, EMA has been used to study complex drinking patterns and dynamic predictors of drinking in near–real time. Compared with other methods, EMA can better sample and capture changes in these phenomena that occur in relatively short time frames.

2500|$|With Santorum {{suspending}} his campaign, Gingrich saw a {{new hope}} of reasserting {{himself as the}} conservative alternative to Romney. His campaign had been scaling down since his March 24 defeat in the Louisiana primary and was $4.3 million in debt {{by the end of}} March. But now it began concentrating on the Delaware primary hoping a win there would be a game changer. The Adelson family that had already supported Gingrich heavily through the [...] "Winning Our Future" [...] super PAC gave another $5 million in late march bringing the PAC's cash on hand up to $5.8 million. But <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> resources of the Gingrich campaign concentrated in Delaware he still lost the state with 29.4 percent to Romney. On May 2 he officially suspended his campaign. Gingrich won two contest (South Carolina and Georgia) nineteen delegate allocating congressional districts. More than 2.4 million people voted for him and he secured a total of 131 delegates before suspending his campaign. He could only show plurality in two states and was therefore not going to appear on the first ballot nominating the Republican candidate for president at the National Convention.|$|E

Unquestionably Burgundy was the first to enter upon the struggle, but the terrible vengeance taken by the Armagnacs,--as the Orleanists came to be called,--for the murders committed by the mob of Paris in alliance with him, was of almost unexampled atrocity in civil war, and was mainly responsible for the terrible acts of cruelty afterwards perpetrated upon each other by both parties. I hope some day to devote another volume to the story of this desperate and unnatural struggle.|$|E

But her dislike of trouble in supporting an opinion did not make her the less pertinacious in upholding it, and there were times when she was wrathful and petulant at Sarah's presumption in maintaining the contrary, <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> authorities in the bookshelves to back her.|$|E

This claimant was Isabella's uncle, the younger brother of Duke Charles who had just died. His name was Antoine de Vaudemonte, or, as it would be expressed in English, Anthony of Vaudemont. This uncle, on the death of Isabella's father, determined to seize the duchy for himself, instead of allowing it to descend to Isabella, the proper heir, who, being but a woman, was looked upon with very little respect.

How he had got his wife, and her dowry, we must hear in Villani's words, as nearly as I can give their force in English, only, instead of the English word pilgrim, I shall use the Italian 'romeo' for the sake both of all English Juliets, and that you may better understand the close of the sixth canto of the Paradise.|$|E

Whoever, in our circumstances, has made trial of pain, <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> alleviations which, for us, usually attend it, must know the irritation that comes with it.

He had flattered himself on leisure to read his Bible; but {{there was no such thing}} as leisure there. In the height of the season, Legree did not hesitate to press all his hands through, Sundays and week-days alike. Why shouldn't he?--he made more cotton by it, and gained his wager; and if it wore out a few more hands, he could buy better ones. At first, Tom used to read a verse or two of his Bible, by the flicker of the fire, after he had returned from his daily toil; but, after the cruel treatment he received, he used to come home so exhausted, that his head swam and his eyes failed when he tried to read; and he was fain to stretch himself down, with the others, in utter exhaustion.|$|E

Perhaps the girl was a little disappointed, and perhaps not unjustly; and yet if it had been enough to be always in the thoughts of another person, and so pervade and alter his whole life, she might have been thoroughly contented. For she was never out of Will's mind for an instant. He sat over the stream, and watched the dust of the eddy, and the poised fish, and straining weeds; he wandered out alone into the purple <b>even,</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> blackbirds piping round him in the wood; he rose early in the morning, and saw the sky turn from grey to gold, and the light leap upon the hill-tops; and all the while he kept wondering if he had never seen such things before, or how it was that they should look so different now. The sound of his own mill-wheel, or of the wind among the trees, confounded and charmed his heart. The most enchanting thoughts presented themselves unbidden in his mind. He was so happy that he could not sleep at night, and so restless that he could hardly sit still out of her company. And yet it seemed as if he avoided her rather than sought her out.|$|E
