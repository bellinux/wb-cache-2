5000|$|All {{three species}} suffer from illegal {{collecting}} and habitat destruction, but the <b>Geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> {{has historically been}} the worst affected and is now endangered.|$|E
5000|$|Many renosterveld {{trees and}} shrubs produce berries, which attract fruit-eating birds (e.g. bulbuls, Cape white-eyes) and other animals (e.g. <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoises,</b> chacma baboons).|$|R
40|$|To help assess habitat {{requirements}} of Critically Endangered <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoises,</b> we used thread-trailing to measure daily activity, movements and refugia of adult Psammobates geometricus in autumn and spring 2002. We found strong differences between seasons, {{and effects of}} weather, individuals and sex. The high activity was consistent with mild weather during autumn and spring. However, daily temperatures limited female movements on cool autumn days and male movements on warm spring days, a pattern consistent with sexual size dimorphism (large females and small males). The long movements in autumn probably helped tortoises find food plants that grow quickly after autumn rains; both sexes recover body condition from autumn lows, and females begin egg production in late-autumn and winter. These movements may also help males mate with females before they ovulate. The high activity of females in spring should help them forage and sustain their vitellogenesis, egg production and nesting in spring. Male paths {{tended to be more}} linear than female paths in both seasons, so this sexual difference is likely not linked to food consumption. Males may move long, linear paths to engage females and avoid other males. Males may have been thermally-challenged in spring. Their movements decreased with increased ground temperatures (in the sun), they used denser refugia in spring than in autumn, and in spring used denser refugia than females used. <b>Geometric</b> <b>tortoises</b> typically used different refugia on consecutive nights, a type of predator avoidance mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} method for assessing blood cell characteristics using an ocular micrometer is time-consuming and limited. We used the Nikon NIS Elements imaging software and May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining {{to determine whether}} automated image analysis is suitable for rapid and accurate quantitative morphometry of erythrocytes. Blood was collected during four seasons from 126 <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoises</b> and the blood smears were evaluated for cell (C) and nuclear (N) characteristics of the erythrocytes. We measured area, length (L), width (W), perimeter, elongation and pixelation intensity, and calculated L/W and N/C areas. Erythrocyte size differed among cohorts; females, the larger sex, had smaller erythrocytes than either males or juveniles. Males had more elongated erythrocytes than females and erythrocytes of adults were more elongated than those of juveniles. Erythrocyte size and shape influence the efficiency of gas exchange owing to surface area to volume ratios, which are greater for small, elongated cells than for large, round cells. The high N/C ratio and low pixelation intensities of males and juveniles indicate {{that they may have}} had more immature erythrocytes in their circulation than females. The use of pixelation intensity to indicate the presence of immature erythrocytes was validated by seasonal differences that corresponded to the biology of the tortoises. Pixelation intensity was lowest in winter. We found that automated image analysis is a rapid and reliable method for determining cell size and shape, and it offers the potential for distinguishing among developmental stages that differ in staining intensity. The method should be useful for rapid health assessments, particularly of threatened species, and for comparative studies among different vertebrates. Web of Scienc...|$|R
50|$|The {{diminutive}} <b>Geometric</b> <b>Tortoise</b> (Psammobates geometricus) {{is one of}} the world's {{most beautiful}} chelonians with its domed carapace and stunning egg-yolk and black radiating pattern. It is the Fabergé Egg of the tortoise world. Fully grown, it reaches only five to six inches. In South Africa, the Turtle Conservancy, along with its partner organizations, has purchased over 1,000 acres of the last remaining habitat for this critically endangered tortoise, which we are calling the <b>Geometric</b> <b>Tortoise</b> Preserve. We need to preserve this critical habitat to save this beautiful tortoise from extinction.|$|E
50|$|The {{geometric}} tortoise's diet consists {{mainly of}} the leaves, geophytes, flowers, and shoots {{of a wide}} range of indigenous fynbos and renosterveld plant and grass species. Some of its more common food plants include Crassula ciliata, Oxalis species, local geophyte species, such as Cyanella hyacinthoides, Babiana angustifolia and Lachenalia contaminata; as well as a variety of grass species such as Themeda triandra, Briza maxima, Cynodon dactylon, Ehrharta calycina, Pentaschistis curvifolia and Eragrostis curvula. A failure to have the full range of these, and other specific local plant species, means that the <b>Geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> soon dies when taken out of its natural habitat or kept in captivity. The specific diet, together with climate, humidity and soil differences, are the principal reasons why the species does not survive for long outside of its habitat. It also means that the <b>Geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> is restricted to south-western Cape Alluvial Fynbos and Shale Renosterveld vegetation types. The <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> consumes at least 14 plant species as food, which includes 64% of Aspalathus species, 60% of Oxalis species and 66% of Berkheya species occur in West Coast renosterveld. Since the distribution range of <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> lies within a winter rainfall area, the annual grasses, geophytes and other herbaceous taxa are important food items during winter. During the summer, the annual green component is reduced and therefore the perennial grass, shrub and succulent components would serve <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> as the major food resource. Food sources tend to have a higher concentration of iron and had lower failure load and tensile strength than non-food plants. When eating the tortoise uses a grab and pull method that tends to be used more in larger herbivores. They take small bites that increase surface area to be exposed to enzymes making digestion easier.|$|E
50|$|The <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> is a {{critically}} endangered species of tortoise {{and one of}} {{three members of the}} genus, Psammobates. It is found in a very small section in the South-Western Cape of South Africa.|$|E
50|$|The <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> is {{naturally}} {{restricted to the}} far south-western corner of the Western Cape Province, South Africa. It used to occur {{as far north as}} Picketberg, as far south as Gordons Bay and eastwards into the Breede River valley. The habitat type of <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> is known as the renosterveld, which is located at the extreme southwestern part of the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The renosterveld forms part of the Fynbos Biomes, a vegetation zone characterized by a Mediterranean climate. There is a fusion of heathlands and shrublands with beginning and ending points hard to distinguish. Shrublands can then be further broken down into strandveld, coastal renosterveld and intercoastal renosterveld.|$|E
50|$|Other {{conservation}} efforts {{are taking place}} {{in order to insure}} the survival of the species. These efforts include studying the types of food that the <b>Geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> eats in order to understand their environmental needs, and the problems with the non-native plant species.|$|E
50|$|Other major {{achievements}} {{include the}} purchase of land {{in one of the}} last remaining strong holds for the critically endangered <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> endemic to South Africa. By securing this land the Turtle Conservancy is playing a critical role in saving the species from extinction.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> used to {{be found}} {{primarily}} in Alluvium Fynbos. Now, with its habitat largely destroyed, it is also critically endangered. Harmony Flats Nature Reserve, which conserves Alluvium Fynbos, lost its last population of these tortoises which became extinct here in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} one of the rarest land {{tortoises}} in the world, classified as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. In addition to its Red List listing, the <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> is now protected under international law and listed on Appendix I of CITES, prohibiting international trade in the species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> {{is able to}} have {{specific}} dietary preferences, adaptation to wet habitats and topographical factors to survival in the habitat. The distribution range of the <b>Geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> lies within a winter rainfall area, which has 350-600 mm annual precipitation. The agriculture utilization and urban development of the renosterveld are the major factors responsible for the massive decline {{on the number of}} tortoise. The destruction of renosterveld reduced the habitat of geometric tortoises to less than 3% of its original size, which has only 4000-5000 hectares remaining. Namely food, cover, nesting and the ability to move around in the habitat are four main biological factors, which are important for the survival of geometric tortoises in their habitat. Geometric tortoises prefer low-lying and well-drained areas, which have a higher percentage of shrub cover and canopy cover at 50 cm above ground level.|$|E
50|$|Today the Turtle Conservancy and Behler Chelonian Center have ongoing {{conservation}} programs around the world, protecting the Critically Endangered ploughshare tortoise (Astrochelys yniphora) in Madagascar, {{as well as}} some of the last important habitat for the Critically Endangered <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> (Psammobates geometricus) in South Africa, with additional programs in Mexico, Southeast Asia, China, United States, South America, and the Caribbean.|$|E
50|$|They {{are said}} to {{hibernate}} in the months of June through September, or when their natural environment is not normal, or when in captivity. Little is known about their reproductive behavior. When the female is ready to lay eggs, she digs {{a hole in the}} ground and covers it with grass or other vegetation. The <b>Geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> tends to feed during cooler parts of the morning and afternoon. They tend to be shy and seek shelter when they notice observers.|$|E
50|$|Harmony Flats was {{originally}} established {{to preserve a}} habitat for the rare and declining <b>Geometric</b> <b>Tortoise</b> (Psammobates geometricus). This tortoise is now unfortunately locally extinct, but the reserve still protects about 220 species of plant (many of them endangered) {{as well as a}} range of animal species, such as the tiny Parrot-beaked tortoise (Homopus areolatus), various snakes and a large variety of birds. This {{is one of the few}} remaining spots of the critically endangered vegetation type “Lourensford Alluvium Fynbos”.Local volunteers and community organisations are now heavily involved in protecting and managing the reserve.|$|E
50|$|Katriena |Una Kassie Rooi {{was one of}} {{the last}} eight {{speakers}} of Nuu language, also known as N/uu, n/huki, ‡Khomani, South Africa's last original San language. Ouma |Una Rooi, or Kaitjie as she was affectionately known, was born in 1930 at Tweerivieren (≠aka≠nous), in what is now the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park which straddles the boundary between South Africa and Botswana. She died on 3 March 2012. |Una was the fourth child of |Khuka and Ari Kassie. |Una, her San name, refers to the soft powder puff, made from the ear of a bat-eared fox. The |una is used to spread buchu powder on new born babies, which is traditionally carried in a purse made from the shell of a <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoise.</b>|$|E
50|$|With South Africa {{being home}} to the most {{tortoise}} species in the world, it’s not surprising that it has the world’s rarest tortoise species as well. Protecting these tortoises is primarily {{the job of the}} country’s conservation officials. These officials work with nature preserves to help keep the tortoise’s status of “endangered” from changing to “extinct.”Its habitat is under constant threat of destruction and fragmentation as a result of, frequent fires, increase in the predation rates, and an increase in vegetation not native to the region. Its environment is now reduced to 31 habitat fragments which include 7 reserves. The Conservation authority of western cape province has made the conservation of the <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> one of its highest priorities. The areas that are left survive primarily because they are in less optimal farming areas.|$|E
50|$|The TC is {{committed}} to promoting in situ conservation and field research of threatened and endangered chelonians globally. Its work includes protection of species in their natural habitat, education about conservation, and field-based research. It campaigns for conservation legislation, re-evaluation of species’ status in the wild, and development of comprehensive protection strategies for turtles and tortoises.The TC has supported projects {{on the ground to}} protect endangered turtles and tortoises in China, Guyana, India, Mexico, Madagascar, Nicaragua, Pakistan, South Africa, and the United States, and has conducted fieldwork around the world, particularly in Southeast Asia, investigating the turtle and tortoise trade. In South Africa, the TC has partnered with the Cape Province wildlife agency Cape Nature and well-known turtle biologist Dr. Margaretha Hofmeyr on two projects related to the Critically Endangered <b>Geometric</b> <b>Tortoise</b> (Psammobates geometricus).|$|E
50|$|The Turtle Conservancy’s in-country {{conservation}} strategies include habitat protection, {{restoration and}} stewardship, turtle and tortoise reintroduction and a fieldwork grant program. In South Africa the Turtle Conservancy owns and stewards more than 1,000 {{acres of land}} in the last remaining habitat for the critically endangered <b>Geometric</b> <b>Tortoise</b> in South Africa. This land is critical habitat needed to save this beautiful tortoise from extinction. In Mexico the Turtle Conservancy is working to protect 43,000 acres of what {{is believed to be the}} last stronghold for the Bolson Tortoise, the largest terrestrial reptile in North America. In Madagascar the Turtle Conservancy collaborates with Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust in protecting the Ploughshare Tortoise from extinction. The Turtle Conservancy engages in education of communities and animal marking to eliminate the illegal poaching of Ploughshare Tortoises. In addition, the Turtle Conservancy is a leading member of the International Ploughshare or Angonoka Working Group, which sets direction for Ploughshare Conservation worldwide. The Turtle Conservancy also supports field work in Nicaragua, Mexico, Guyana, Pakistan, India, the Philippines, Namibia, Indonesia, China, and Myanmar.|$|E
40|$|The <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> Psammobates geometricus, {{found in}} the Western Cape, {{is one of the}} world's rarest tortoises. The cryptic {{colouration}} and sedentary behaviour of the <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> causes problems when conducting counts using standard capture-recapture methods. The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the detection probability of a <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> in the field on a purely experimental basis. Plaster of Paris tortoise models were placed in predetermined transects in the natural habitat. Observes surveyed these transects for the tortoise models. Three group and two individual experiments were conducted. These experiments suggest that a large percentage of geometric tortoises are not found during a census. In individual experiments no observer detected more than 50 % of the models, but in some cases this percentage was slightly higher in group experiments. The effect of the size of the tortoise, density of the habitat, level of experience and searching ability of the observers are discussed. Estimates of the various detection probabilities are derived and suggestions made for conducting tortoise counts. Articl...|$|E
40|$|Food and non-food plant {{characteristics}} were studied for the <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoise,</b> Psammobates geometricus, {{to test the}} hypothesis that feeding preferences in tortoises may be influenced by the mechanical properties of plant leaves. Twelve focal feeding observations made between 8 October and 31 October 2002 were synthesized with literature reports to develop species lists of food and non-food grasses and geophytes in renosterveld habitat. Failure load and tensile strength were determined in the field for leaves of food and non-food plants that were spatially available to the tortoises and present in relative abundance {{during the course of the}} study. Leaves of geophyte food plants were fleshy and succulent with a low failure load and tensile strength. Leaves of food plant grasses had significantly higher failure loads and tensile strengths compared to leaves of food plant geophytes. In non-food plants there was no significant difference in failure load between grasses and geophytes, but tensile strength was significantly higher in the grasses. Non-food plant grasses and geophytes overall had significantly higher failure load and tensile strength values than did food plants. Two non-food plants that overlapped in mechanical strength to the food plants either have toxic/unpalatable chemicals in high amounts or are recent invasive species to the renosterveld. Thus, these studies support the hypothesis that leaf biomechanical properties may be an important factor in determining the diet of the <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> and perhaps tortoises in general.     </span...|$|E
40|$|Magister Scientiae (Biodiversity and Conservation Biology) - MSc (Biodiv and Cons Biol) The <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> {{is one of}} the world‟s rarest {{terrestrial}} tortoises and is {{endemic to}} the Southwestern Cape, South Africa. There has been cause for conservation concern for Psammobates geometricus, yet as is common for many species, quantitative physiological research has been lacking. Considering the important role of red blood cells in oxygen circulation, and the role of white blood cells in immune resistance, blood profiles have been used across taxa as a reliable indicator of health status and physiological processes. Forming part of a larger chelonian conservation programme in South Africa, I studied the haematological changes in P. geometricus, to better understand their physiological responses to changes in climatic conditions. Sampled peripheral blood from males, females and juveniles of the largest known wild <b>geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> population over four seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter) from August 2000 to June 2001. Blood samples were used to make smears and determine red cell count (RCC), packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobi concentration (Hb), red cell indices and differential white cell counts. Digital imaging analysis was used for the histological evaluation of stained blood smears, including descriptions of red and white blood cell morphologies, as well as erythrocyte developmental stages. In the cooler periods, geometric tortoises showed low Hb and mean cell haemoglobin concentration values. Erythrocytes were larger and rounder in winter and spring, which were likely due to hydration states. In addition, increased numbers of immature erythrocytes in circulation suggested an erythropoietic response in winter and spring. This regenerative response is common in reptiles emerging from periods of limited activity and is associated with increasing primary production following rainfall events. In the following summer and autumn, increased mean cell haemoglobin concentrations suggested elevated metabolic rates influenced by rising temperatures. This would seem pertinent to meet the extra physical demands associated with foraging effort in the season characterised with limited water and food supply, and mating behaviour, which occurs in the summer. Low body conditions across all cohorts provided evidence for nutrition stress, while erythrocyte size, shape and degenerative responses indicated dehydration stress. Physiological responses to seasonal influences are specific to growth or reproductive demands and differed for each cohort. Males experienced increased Hb, PCV, RCC, and erythrocyte sizes in summer and autumn, which relate to the erythropoieticstimulating effects of androgens. Female erythropoietic cycles in spring accommodate the increased metabolic demands of increased foraging needed for a larger body size and egg production, and again in autumn again for vitellogenesis. Juvenile tortoises showed minimal differences, and could indicate species-specific responses to environmental changes. A spring-related erythropoiesis was observed in juveniles while during summer and autumn, juveniles showed less evidence for dehydration stress than in adults. No haemoparasites were observed in peripheral blood. Seven leukocyte types were identified and included heterophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, monocytes and azurophils, in addition to thrombocytes. Heterophils were the most abundant leukocyte, followed by lymphocytes and eosinophils while monocytes and basophils were equally low; plasma cells and azurophils were rare. Heterophil counts were higher in spring than in summer and autumn, and in summer, were more abundant in females than in juveniles. Eosinophil counts were low in spring for all cohorts, and additionally, female and juvenile counts were low in summer. Eosinophils in juveniles were significantly lower than in adults in winter and spring. Lymphocyte numbers increased in autumn for all cohorts, while summer counts were higher in juveniles than in adults. Basophils and monocytes showed minimal seasonal changes, although basophil counts in females in winter tended to be high. Thrombocytes were lowest in spring for all cohorts. Understanding the physiological responses associated with seasonal changes and for each cohort is critical for effective chelonian conservation management. Results obtained from this study indicate a clinically healthy population of Psammobates geometricus and represented the first of this kind to establish baseline haematological reference data for this Critically Endangered tortoise species...|$|E
40|$|Magister Scientiae (Biodiversity and Conservation Biology) Due to the {{critical}} status of Psammobates geometricus and the vulnerability of their habitat, {{there is a need}} to allocate areas for their protection. The aim of this study was to provide information on the space requirements and activity level of geometric tortoises to facilitate future conservation efforts. The thread-and-spool method was used to compare short-term movements, habitat utilisation, and activity patterns of male and female tortoises over 15 and 20 days respectively, in autumn and spring. Through radiotelemetry, the long-term movements of 10 male and 11 female tortoises were evaluated from April 2002 to April 2003. Locality data for the short-term and long-term studies were used to calculate the size of activity areas and home ranges as minimum convex polygons and fixed kernel estimates. Male and female geometric tortoises were active throughout the year, and maintained a high level of activity in autumn and in spring. However, females were more active than males were in spring. Females may require more resources, particularly food, in spring when they produce eggs. Although males and females travelled similar distances in autumn and in spring, males displaced further than females displaced in both seasons. The movement path for males was often linear, perhaps because this path may enhance their opportunities to encounter females. <b>Geometric</b> <b>tortoise</b> males were substantially smaller than females, which may explain why the distances that males moved and displaced in spring were negatively correlated to environmental temperature. In autumn, when temperatures were lower than in spring, the distance travelled by males was not correlated to temperature. However, in autumn female displacement showed a positive correlation with environmental temperature. Geometric tortoises showed large inter-individual variation in home range size, which may contribute to the fact that home range size did not differ among the three different habitat types: mature renosterveld, burned renosterveld and the old agricultural fields. Average home range size was 11. 5 ha for 95 % fixed kernel estimates, and 7. 0 ha for minimum convex polygon estimates. Body size influenced the home range size of female geometric tortoises, but had no effect on the home range size of male tortoises. Females had larger home ranges than male tortoises had, possibly because females were larger, but reproductive requirements of females may have played a role. During the dry season, home range size increased when compared to the wet season. The larger home range during the dry season, which is associated with high temperatures, may be related to a reduction in resource availability. The fewer resources available, the greater the distance the tortoises would need to travel in order to acquire the necessary resources. The small home range in the wet season may indicate an abundance of resources, but it may also be that large pools of standing water restrict the movements of tortoises. Understanding the spatial and habitat requirements of P. geometricus will help to assess the viability of populations in disturbed and highly fragmented areas, and contribute to the conservation efforts for this endangered species.
