25|$|Funding {{from federal}} and private sources for {{research}} at MSU was $109.5 {{million in the}} 2009-2010 school year (Cruzado's first year on campus, reflecting grants awarded during her predecessor's tenure). It fell to $102.7 million in the 2010-2011 school year. This included a five-year, $3.85 million grant from the National Science Foundation to study fire and climate change in forests in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Statets. The grant was shared with the University of Colorado, the University of Idaho, and the United States Forest Service, and it was unclear how much money actually went to MSU. It also included a $1.6 million grant from the United States Department of Energy to study ways to store carbon dioxide underground, a grant the university had been working to obtain from Congress for several years. Another award was a four-year, $1.2 million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The <b>grant</b> paid <b>for</b> <b>integration</b> of biomedical science into the undergraduate curriculum and paid for undergraduate biomedical research. It also paid for science and technology outreach to {{elementary and middle school}} Native Americans, and for scholarships to bring Native American students to MSU and expose them to science and technology courses. It was the third time MSU received the grant.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an article}} about the {{connections}} between school mental health services and No Child Left Behind from November 2006, Brian P. Daly et al. cited a National Institute of Mental Health study that found that between 5% and 9% of students face emotional and behavioral issues that impede their learning. [...] Beyond this, a report by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention on the interaction between school policies and health for adolescents noted in 2008 that some twenty percent of students annually demonstrate evidence of experiencing a mental health issue. [...] Additionally, the Department of Education, in its application materials for its program of <b>Grants</b> <b>for</b> the <b>Integration</b> of Schools and Mental Health Systems, notes that the majority of mental, emotional and behavior disorders have their foundation in childhood or adolescence. They report {{that more than half of}} adults who have experienced a mental, emotional or behavioral disorder claim that it began during those early years and that by the age of sixteen nearly forty percent of children and young adults have experienced a psychiatric disorder. Furthermore, the Department of Education reports that mental health concerns overlap with and in many cases undergird other important themes in education today, such as bullying. In their Introduction, the Department of Education cites one study that showed that both perpetrators and victims of incidences of bullying were twice as likely to report symptoms of depression than other students.|$|R
40|$|Most {{programming}} languages {{were designed}} {{before the age}} of web. This matters because the web changes many assumptions that typed functional language designers take <b>for</b> <b>granted.</b> <b>For</b> example, programs do not run in a closed word, but must instead interact with (changing and likely unreliable) services and data sources, communication is often asynchronous or event-driven, and programs need to interoperate with untyped environments. In this paper, we present how F # language and libraries face the challenges posed by the web. Technically, this comprises using type providers <b>for</b> <b>integration</b> with external information sources and <b>for</b> <b>integration</b> with untyped programming environments, using lightweight meta-programming for targeting JavaScript and computation expressions for writing asynchronous code. In this inquiry, the holistic perspective is more important than each of the features in isolation. We use a practical case study as a starting point and look how F # language and libraries approach the challenges posed by the web. The specific lessons learned are perhaps less interesting than our attempt to uncover hidden assumptions that no longer hold in the age of web. ...|$|R
