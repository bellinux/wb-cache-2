5|$|Following this, Inna appears {{wearing a}} yellow dress while {{standing}} on a stair, with <b>her</b> <b>shadow</b> not moving alike to her. When the track's breakdown is played, Inna is presented lying on a XXL-photo of her face, {{and she and her}} backup dancers are particularly shown clapping their hands and performing subtle movements. The visual ends with Inna appearing on the TV's display from the beginning, before it is switched off by a woman previously shown. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray people performing tribal moves while the video's frame is vertically constrained to just the center of the screen, and two lesbian girls touching their body and picturing themselves.|$|E
5|$|Lamont began {{appointing}} {{members of}} <b>her</b> <b>shadow</b> cabinet on 19 December 2011. Those given positions on her initial frontbench team include Macintosh (Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth), Hugh Henry (Labour spokesman for Education and Lifelong Learning), Lewis Macdonald (Shadow Justice Minister) and Boyack (Local Government and Planning). The post of Shadow Health Minister {{was given to}} Jackie Baillie, who had held the position previously. Gray was not included, as he had expressed a wish {{to take a break}} from frontline politics.|$|E
5|$|The Queen (voiced by Susanne Blakeslee) is {{the main}} villain in the 2005 direct-to-video {{animated}} film Once Upon a Halloween, but appears only in the Witch version despite misleading cover art (furthermore, only <b>her</b> <b>shadow</b> is shown). In it, the Queen plots to conquer Halloween and asks her cauldron to show several villains to which one of them helps her in her plan. The cauldron also explains its origins as {{it is one of}} the cauldrons formerly owned by the three witches from The Black Cauldron. Eventually, the cauldron turns against the Wicked Queen and makes her vanish into nothingness.|$|E

5|$|Odaenathus was {{succeeded by}} his son; the ten-year-old Vaballathus. Zenobia, {{the mother of}} the new king, was the de facto ruler and Vaballathus {{remained}} in <b>her</b> <b>shadow</b> while she consolidated her power. Gallienus dispatched his prefect Heraclian to command military operations against the Persians, but he was marginalized by Zenobia and returned to the West. The queen was careful not to provoke Rome, claiming for herself and her son the titles held by her husband while guaranteeing the safety of the borders with Persia and pacifying the Tanukhids in Hauran. To protect the borders with Persia, Zenobia fortified different settlements on the Euphrates including the citadels of Halabiye and Zalabiye. Circumstantial evidence exist for confrontations with the Sasanians; probably in 269 Vaballathus took the title Persicus Maximus ("The great victor in Persia") and the title might be linked with an unrecorded battle against a Persian army trying to regain control of Northern Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|The tale of Revanta's {{birth is}} narrated in scriptures like Vishnu Purana and Markandeya Purana. Once, Sanjna, the {{daughter}} of celestial architect Vishvakarma and wife of Surya, unable to take the fervour of the Sun-god, repaired to the forests to engage in devout austerities {{in the form of}} a mare. She placed <b>her</b> <b>shadow</b> Chhaya, who looked just like Sanjna in her position as Surya's wife. When Surya realised that Chhaya was not the real Sanjna, he searched for Sanjna and finally found her in the forests of Uttar Kuru. There, Surya approached Sanjna disguised as a horse. Their union produced the twin-Ashvins and Revanta. In Kurma Purana and Matsya Purana, the mother of Revanta is named Rajni, another wife of Surya. While in another chapter of Markandeya Purana, he is son of Chhaya and his brothers are the Saturn-god Shani and Savarni Manu.|$|E

25|$|Following Smith's {{death in}} 1994, Mowlam, {{alongside}} Peter Kilfoyle, became a principal organiser of Tony Blair's {{campaign for the}} Labour leadership. After his victory, Blair made <b>her</b> <b>Shadow</b> Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. She initially resisted being appointed to the position, preferring an economic portfolio, but, after accepting it, she threw her weight into the job.|$|E
25|$|In June 2004 she {{was moved}} to become Shadow Secretary of State for the Family. Following the 2005 general {{election}} she was also made Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. David Cameron appointed <b>her</b> <b>Shadow</b> Leader of the House of Commons in December 2005 after his accession to the leadership. In January 2009, May was made Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.|$|E
25|$|The {{title role}} is {{undoubtedly}} {{the main focus}} of the ballet.

25|$|Corporal York {{decided to}} {{withdraw}} his section {{and proceeded to}} booby trap their Carl Gustav recoilless rifle, before paddling their Gemini assault boat north across Port William. As he did so, York claimed an Argentine destroyer began pursuing them (the corvette ARA Granville according to Argentine sources). His initiative led to the Gemini reaching an anchored Polish fishing vessel, hiding the small assault boat under <b>her</b> <b>shadow.</b> They patiently waited for a chance, {{before moving to the}} shore and landing on a small beach.|$|E
25|$|Christie {{adapted the}} book as a play {{of the same name}} in 1945. It is notable for being one of the most radical reworkings of a novel Christie ever did, not only {{eliminating}} Hercule Poirot from the story, but also changing the identity of the killer. In the play, the ill Mrs Boynton committed suicide and dropped several red herrings that pointed to her family members as possible suspects, hoping that they would suspect each other and therefore continue to live in <b>her</b> <b>shadow</b> even after her death. In addition, the character of Carol Boynton has been dropped, Ginevra is now a stepdaughter (rather than a natural child) of Mrs Boynton, Lady Westholme becomes an ex-Member of Parliament, Miss Pierce is now Miss Pryce, and Alderman Higgs has been added as a fellow vacationer/verbal sparring partner for Lady Westholme.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Meredith Grey is the {{daughter}} of world-renowned surgeon Ellis Grey, and grew up in <b>her</b> <b>shadow.</b> Ellis was a deeply flawed, emotionally and verbally abusive, neglectful mother towards her. Meredith is described as a [...] "dark and twisty," [...] damaged person who sees the world in varying shades of gray morality. Because of this, she is an emotionally complex person capable of empathizing with others when they're at their lowest points, and a sensitive observer of the people around her. Meredith is a graduate of Dartmouth College and nearly did not attend med school due to conflicts with her mother. Meredith was directionless after obtaining her undergrad and had plans to sleep and party her way through Europe. After a month abroad, Meredith was called back to care for Ellis, who had developed early-onset Alzheimer's disease, and Meredith obtained her M.D.|$|E

25|$|While {{living in}} New York City, Man Ray was {{visually}} {{influenced by the}} 1913 Armory Show and galleries of European contemporary works. His early paintings display facets of cubism. After befriending Marcel Duchamp, who was interested in showing movement in static paintings, his works began to depict movement of the figures. An example is the repetitive positions of the dancer's skirts in The Rope Dancer Accompanies Herself with <b>Her</b> <b>Shadows</b> (1916).|$|R
500|$|Bruce David Forbes, {{author of}} Religion and Popular Culture in America, {{felt that the}} video drew on Madonna's {{childhood}} experiences and dramatized her efforts to renegotiate these relationships, in her daily interactions with her lover and father, and in relation to Catholicism, which the singer {{referred to in the}} line [...] "Oh father I have sinned". Dunn noticed that like the Pepsi commercial shot for her earlier single [...] "Like a Prayer", Madonna's persona is split into a child and adult, who repeatedly fuse and separate. Leslie C. Dunn commented that as the narrative developed, the child is shown singing, but the adult Madonna's voice is heard, and when the adult Madonna appears in a hallway, <b>her</b> <b>shadow</b> is that of a child. Madonna responded to these observations by saying: [...] "I think the biggest reason I was able to express myself and not be intimidated was not having a mother." ...|$|E
500|$|Light and {{darkness}} feature prominently in Psycho. The first shot after the intertitle is the sunny landscape of Phoenix before the camera enters a dark hotel room where Sam and Marion appear as bright figures. Marion is almost immediately cast in darkness; she is preceded by <b>her</b> <b>shadow</b> as she reenters {{the office to}} steal money and as she enters her bedroom. When she flees Phoenix, darkness descends on her drive. The following sunny morning is punctured by a watchful police officer with black sunglasses, and she finally arrives at the Bates Motel in near darkness. Bright lights are also [...] "the ironic equivalent of darkness" [...] in the film, blinding instead of illuminating. Examples of brightness include the opening window shades in Sam's and Marion's hotel room, vehicle headlights at night, the neon sign at the Bates Motel, [...] "the glaring white" [...] of the bathroom tiles where Marion dies, and the fruit cellar's exposed light bulb shining on the corpse of Norman's mother. Such bright lights typically characterize danger and violence in Hitchcock's films.|$|E
2500|$|Catherine [...] "Kitty" [...] Bennet – The fourth Bennet {{daughter}} at 17 years old.

She is often portrayed as envious of Lydia and is described a [...] "silly" [...] young woman. However, {{it is said that}} she improved when removed from Lydia's influence. According to James Edward Austen-Leigh's A Memoir of Jane Austen, Kitty later married a clergyman who lived near Pemberley.|$|E
60|$|How much pleasanter {{it would}} be to think that her shine was the {{reflection}} of our cherry orchards, and that <b>her</b> <b>shadows</b> were just Kentish hay-ricks, barns, and oast-houses. It was, too, perhaps rather tactless of my father to beguile me with full-grown authors' accounts of the Lives of the Little. Accomplished writers they may be, but--well, never mind. As for the Lives of the Great, I could easily adjust Monsieur Bon Papa's spyglass and reduce them to scale.|$|R

In the pilot episode, she left Models Inc. in a public fight with Hillary and on the evening of her goodbye party from the agency, she was thrown off the balcony of the high rise office building causing a [...] "Who Killed Teri Spencer?" [...] murder mystery. Teri was first glimpsed on an episode of Melrose Place.|$|R

2500|$|The {{video for}} his first {{official}} single from Trilogy, a revamped version of [...] "Wicked Games", was released just weeks later on 18 October 2012, again through his website. Chris Martins of Spin describes the video, [...] "The clip is almost a sequel to the similarly shot [...] "Rolling Stone" [...] video, wherein a woman draped over the singer's back mysteriously disappears by the song's end. This time, the shot opens on a dancing, purse-lipped model type, but <b>her</b> <b>shadow</b> soon vamps away from her body, and torments Tesfaye until the track's end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Ed Miliband's {{election}} as leader, {{she returned to}} her role as Deputy Leader, shadowing Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister and with the title of Deputy Leader of the Opposition. When Miliband assigned portfolios on 8 October 2010, he appointed <b>her</b> <b>Shadow</b> Secretary of State for International Development. In 2010, Harman referred to Danny Alexander as a [...] "ginger rodent" [...] {{in a speech to the}} Scottish Labour Party conference. This was greeted with cheers and laughter from the conference, but the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party described them as gingerism and [...] "anti-Scottish". Harman apologised for the offence caused. In 2011, Harman was moved to become Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. In 2014, she accused Nick Clegg of turning into a Tory during Prime Minister's Questions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album is}} named after track four, [...] "Talk a Good Game" [...] which {{features}} Kevin Cossom. Over a [...] "snaky but sweet" [...] production from T-Minus Rowland sings [...] "I don’t think I can take another broken promise / Why do things the hard way when you can just be honest". Hampp said that Cossom's rap gave the song a [...] "street edge". It takes the listener on an emotional journey according to The Honesty Hour. The next song, [...] "Down on Love", is a midtempo production featuring another classic sample, this time the 1987 song [...] "Rock Steady" [...] by American R group The Whispers. Using her mezzo-soprano vocals, Rowland takes on a downtrodden romantic situation, [...] "We want two different things at two different times / You know how the story go / Easy come easy go". [...] "Dirty Laundry" [...] was co-written by Rowland, Carlos McKinney and The Dream, and is R [...] "confessional" [...] ballad, containing [...] "R jam spools" [...] and a piano-led melody. It details a [...] "frank and often poignant commentary" [...] on Rowland's life. The song is a [...] "brutal" [...] chronicle of {{the last ten years}} of Rowland's life, covering her envy of Beyoncé's solo success and the end of an abusive relationship. Amongst the lyrics, Rowland sings [...] "Kinda lucky I was in <b>her</b> <b>shadow</b> / Phone call from my sister what’s the matter / She said, 'Oh no / You gotta leave' / I’m on the kitchen floor / He took the keys." ...|$|E
