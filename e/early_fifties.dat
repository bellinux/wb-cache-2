5|$|After the war, Brain was {{appointed}} Qantas' Assistant General Manager. Fysh {{was still in}} his <b>early</b> <b>fifties</b> and appeared unlikely to retire any time soon. Seeing little chance of further advancement where he was, Brain took the opportunity to apply for the position of Operations Manager at Trans Australia Airlines (TAA), a new domestic carrier established by the Federal Labor government and run by the Australian National Airlines Commission (ACAC), which was chaired by Arthur Coles. Qantas could not match the £2,250 salary associated with the TAA role, and Brain advised Fysh of his resignation on 10April 1946. In the event, ACAC appointed him TAA's General Manager on 3June, with a £3,000 salary and an undertaking to increase this to as much as £5,000 in the future.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{practical}} finite-time stability for linear and nonlinear systems subject to disturbances and parametric uncertainties {{together with an}} effective and efficient robust control has been, since the <b>earliest</b> <b>Fifties,</b> {{one of the most}} studied research topic and nowadays remains actual and significant. In this book a new and more general approach to these important matters is proposed. New useful results on robust practical stability and stabilization for linear and nonlinear uncertain continuous and also discrete systems, simple to be applied, generally little conservative, valid for a quite general class of systems with relevant interest to engineers, are stated and illustrated with numerous significant examples, highlighting also the superiority of the presented methods over some reliable results available in literature. The relevance of the results provided in this book lies in their utility to solve numerous practical analysis and synthesis problems (e. g. the robust tracking of generic reference signals) ...|$|R

25|$|During {{his time}} at the {{conservatory}} Gryce also developed connections in the Hartford, Boston, and New York jazz scenes which would have a tremendous effect on his later career as a jazz musician, composer, and arranger. While New York was best known for cutting edge jazz of the time, both Boston and Hartford were also the sites of active and innovative jazz scenes. Gryce traveled between the two cities, and arranged for local bands including those of Sabby Lewis, Phil Edmonds, and Bunky Emerson. While Gryce developed his theoretical background and {{a passion for the}} works of Bartok and Stravinsky, he simultaneously developed an obsession for the work of Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk, who he became acquainted with and performed with around 1949. Gryce developed a reputation as a well-trained and talented artist, and became relatively well known in the local Boston and Hartford scenes. He also began to explore the New York scene, where he would eventually find himself in the <b>early</b> <b>fifties.</b>|$|E
25|$|In about 1594 Byrd's career {{entered a}} new phase. He was now in his <b>early</b> <b>fifties,</b> and seems to have gone into semi-retirement from the Chapel Royal. He moved with his family from Harlington to Stondon Massey, a small village near Chipping Ongar in Essex. His {{ownership}} of Stondon Place, where he lived {{for the rest of}} his life, was bitterly contested by Joanna Shelley, with whom he engaged in a protracted and unedifying legal dispute lasting about a decade and a half. The main reason for the move was apparently the proximity of Byrd's patron Sir John Petre (the son of the former Secretary of State Sir William Petre). A wealthy local landowner, Petre was a discreet Catholic who maintained two local manor houses, Ingatestone Hall and Thorndon Hall, the first of which still survives in a much-altered state. Petre held clandestine Mass celebrations, with music provided by his servants, which were subject to the unwelcome attention of spies and paid informers working for the Crown.|$|E

500|$|By {{this time}} tournaments were {{becoming}} more frequent, and the round-robin format was adopted. [...] At the same time, Anderssen, {{after losing the}} match to Morphy in 1858 and to Steinitz in 1866, re-dedicated himself to chess, particularly studying both endgames and positional play. [...] The result was that Anderssen, in his <b>early</b> <b>fifties,</b> was playing the finest chess of his career. [...] As a result, Anderssen compiled a very successful tournament record in the late stages of his career: five first places, two second places, two third places; and a sixth place in {{the final year of}} his life, when his health was failing. One of his first places was ahead of Steinitz, Gustav Neumann, Joseph Henry Blackburne, Louis Paulsen and several other very strong players at the Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament. This is {{regarded as one of the}} top 20 strongest tournaments ever despite the proliferation of [...] "super tournaments" [...] since 1990. One of Anderssen's third places was at the strong Vienna 1873 tournament, when he was 55. About half of Anderssen's tournament successes came at championships of the different regional German Chess Federations; but these were open to all nationalities, and most of them had a few [...] "topten" [...] or even [...] "topfive" [...] competitors. Anderssen usually beat Zukertort in matches but his dominance came to an end came 1871.|$|E
500|$|On {{the time}} periods the series could {{potentially}} explore following {{the first season}} given Carter's role in , Atwell said, [...] "I think {{the great thing about}} the fact that I've already played her {{at the end of her}} life means that we know ... we have an opportunity, if the show does go into second and third and fourth and fifth , we know that we can explore all of these aspects of her character because we know she lives such a long life and she's had a fulfilled life. I think what's going to start happening in Season 1 is seeds are going to be planted as to what happens in her personal life—and yet it's still open to the possibility of new men coming into her life, deepening relationships with the men that we discover in Season 1. Obviously, the era is 1946 but in the second, third, fourth, fifth season—if it goes onto that—we can explore different time periods. We can explore the late forties, the <b>early</b> <b>fifties,</b> the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, up until present day, so it's very exciting because of that." [...] However, Butters clarified that future seasons would likely stay in the same time period, possibly changing location to a place like Hollywood or Europe, to remain in a pre-S.H.I.E.L.D. setting and avoid competing with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. This was the case with the second season, which moved the series to 1947 Los Angeles.|$|E
