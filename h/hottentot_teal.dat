50|$|The <b>Hottentot</b> <b>teal</b> (Spatula hottentota) is {{a species}} of dabbling duck of the genus Spatula. It is migratory {{resident}} in eastern and southern Africa, from Sudan and Ethiopia west to Niger and Nigeria and south to South Africa and Namibia. In west Africa and Madagascar it is sedentary.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Hottentot</b> <b>teal</b> breed year round, {{depending}} on rainfall, {{and stay in}} small groups or pairs. They build nests above water in tree stumps and use vegetation. Ducklings leave the nest soon after hatching, and the mother's parenting is limited to providing protection from predators and leading young to feeding areas. This species is omnivorous and prefers smaller shallow bodies of water.|$|E
50|$|The bird {{sanctuary}} has about 165 species of birds; the lesser and greater flamingos, great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus) and pink-backed pelican (Pelecanus rufescens) {{are the most}} dominant species, they arrive annually in large numbers {{as part of their}} migration during the winter season. Some of the other notable bird species recorded are: avocet, blackwinged stilt (Himantopus himantopus), blacksmith lapwing (Vanellus armatus), black-necked grebe (Podiceps nigricollis), bustards, carmine, darters, African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer), geese, korhaans, pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), black-chested snake-eagle (Circaetus pectoralis), blue-cheeked bee-eater (Merops persicus), Cape teal (Anas capensis), kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), <b>Hottentot</b> <b>teal</b> (Anas hottentota), martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus), red-knobbed coot, (Fulica cristata), secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius), spoonbills, and white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata).|$|E
40|$|Bird counts {{were carried}} out at thirty-four study sites within a {{perimeter}} of 10 km from the shorelines of the two lakes, while all bird captures were conducted on a few sites along the shorelines of the two lakes. Both counting (22 missions) and capturing (15 missions) produced records of 297 bird species. A total of 2135 birds of 110 species were ringed, with total numbers of ringed birds per mission ranging from 34 (lowest in November 2010) to 294 (November 2008). The most commonly ringed bird species were Redbilled Teal (636), African Jacana (408), White-faced Duck (218), Blacksmith Lapwing (113), Kittlitz's Plover (84), Wood Sandpiper (53), African Snipe (35), Redbilled Quelea (32), Barn Swallow (31) and <b>Hottentot</b> <b>Teal</b> (29). Most of the waterbird species were captured during the cold/dry to hot/dry seasons (July to November) when water levels on both lakes were low. Ten species of duck, goose and teal captured accounted for 43. 3 % of all the birds ringed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|Lutembe bay is a {{sheltered}} shallow bay {{on the northern}} shores of Lake Victoria near Entebbe International Airport with scattered mud islands often covered by water hyacinth. It has many Palaearctic migrants, particularly huge congregations of gulls and terns. Interesting species such as Caspian Tern Sterna caspia, <b>Hottentot</b> <b>Teal</b> Anas hottentota, Temminck’s Stint Calidris temminckii and Broad-billed Sandpiper Limicola falcinellus have been found as vagrant visitors by diligently searching the masses of terns, ducks and waders. On the late afternoon of 8 December 2010 I observed a Calidris wader which recalled a Red Knot C. canuta, a species with which I am familiar in the UK. I informed my teammate Henry Seguya and we managed to get our boatman to paddle us a bit closer. The bird {{appeared to be an}} adult in non-breeding plumage and its general size and dark spotting on the breast sides led me to think that it might be a Great Knot C. tenuirostris. Unfortunately it became nervous and flew to another island and we were unable to pursue it before darkness fell. I was, however, able to take some record shots. I circulated the best of four poor photographs to a few birding colleagues fo...|$|E

This tribe includes all of the 2 ̆ 2 puddle ducks 2 ̆ 2 that constitute most of the important game species throughout the world. Of the 39 species making up the tribe, all but 3 can readily {{be placed in the}} single genus Anas. The tribe has a worldwide distribution, with some of the species occurring on several continents and having extensive transcontinental migration patterns. However, most of the species are temperate-breeding forms and are generally adapted to shallow, marshy habitats where food can be obtained from near the surface by dabbling or tipping-up. In most species the males have fairly elaborate and colorful breeding plumages, whereas the ground-nesting females are mostly cryptically patterned with buff and brown. In nearly all species both sexes have iridescent wing speculum markings, and in all species the trachea has an enlarged bulla at the syrinx. Pair bonds are generally reformed each year during the nonbreeding season, but in some species with long breeding seasons the pair bonds are relatively permanent and the males remain with their offspring and help to protect them...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to test and evaluate the various taxonomic arrangements of the family, to discover some of the trends of behavioral evolution, {{and to provide a}} basis for future workers to use in naming, describing, and evaluating the behavioral patterns observed in waterfowl. The major sexual behavior patterns of the species of Anatidae are reviewed and summarized, for the purpose of clarifying evolutionary relationships in the family, tracing the evolution of behavior patterns through various taxa, and evaluating the importance of certain behavior patterns as potential isolating mechanisms.
