40|$|Abstract—The {{presented}} paper {{shows the}} possibility of using holographic interferometry for measurement of temperature field in moving fluids. There are a few methods for identification of velocity fields in fluids, such us LDA, PIV, hot wire anemometry. It is very difficult to measure the temperature field in moving fluids. One of the often used methods is Constant Current Anemometry (CCA), which is a point temperature measurement method. Data are possibly acquired at frequencies up to 1000 Hz. This frequency should be limiting factor for using of CCA in fluid when fast change of temperature occurs. This shortcoming of CCA measurements should be overcome by using of optical methods such as holographic interferometry. It is necessary to employ a special holographic setup with <b>double</b> <b>sensitivity</b> instead of the commonly used Mach-Zehnder type of holographic interferometer in order to attain the parameters sufficient for the studied case. This setup is not light efficient like the Mach-Zehnder type but has <b>double</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> The special technique of acquiring and phase averaging of results from holographic interferometry is also presented. The results from the holographic interferometry experiments will be compared with the temperature field achieved by methods CCA method.

40|$|Medical {{differential}} phase contrast x-ray imaging (DPCI) promises improved soft-tissue contrast at lower x-ray dose. The dose strongly depends {{on both the}} angular sensitivity and on the visibility of a grating-based Talbot-Lau interferometer. Using a conventional x-ray tube, a high sensitivity and a high visibility are somewhat contradicting goals: To increase sensitivity, the grating period has to be reduced and/or the grating distance increased. Technically, this means using a higher Talbot order (3 rd or 5 th one instead of first one). This however reduces the visibility somewhat, because only a smaller part of the tube spectrum will get used. This work proposes to relax this problem by changing the phase grating geometry. This allows to <b>double</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (i. e., double the Talbot order) without reducing the visibility. One proposed grating geometry is an older binary one (75...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{uniaxial}} micro-machined resonant accelerometer is presented. The device {{working principle}} {{is based on}} the stiffness variations of a beam which is fully clamped to the substrate on one side and clamped to a seismic mass on the other side. A movement of the seismic mass, induced by an external acceleration, causes either a compressive or a tensile stress on the beam, inducing a variation of its stiffness.

Coloured oil droplets in the cone photoreceptors represent an adaptation in the avian retina, acting as long-pass colour filters. However, we currently lack understanding of how the optical properties and morphology of component structures (e. g. oil droplet, mitochondrial ellipsoid and outer segment) of the cone photoreceptor influence the transmission of light into the outer segment and the ultimate effect they have on receptor sensitivity. In this study, we use data from microspectrophotometry, digital holographic microscopy and electron microscopy to inform electromagnetic models of avian cone photoreceptors to quantitatively investigate the integrated optical function of the cell. We find that pigmented oil droplets primarily function as spectral filters, not light collection devices, although the mitochondrial ellipsoid improves optical coupling between the inner segment and oil droplet.

POPE sequences were developed for detecting phosphocholine (PC), phosphoethanolamine (PE), glycerophosphocholine (GPC), and glycerophosphoethanolamine (GPE) on the (1) H channel, thereby using the enhanced sensitivity of the (1) H nuclei over (31) P detection. Five healthy volunteers were examined with POPE and (31) P-MRS. POPE editing showed a more than <b>doubled</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in an ideal phantom experiment as compared with direct (31) P MRS with Ernst angle excitation. In vivo, despite increased relaxation losses, significant gains in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 30 - 40 % were shown for PE and GPE[*]+[*]PC levels in the human brain. The SNR of GPC was lower in the POPE measurement compared with the (31) P-MRS measurement.

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of an extended property close source-separation system for solid household waste (i. e. a systems for collection of recyclables from domestic properties) is investigated in a residential area in southern Sweden. Since 2001, households {{have been able to}} source-separate waste into six fractions of dry recyclables and food waste sorting. The current system was evaluated using the EASEWASTE life cycle assessment tool. Current status is compared with an ideal scenario in which households display perfect source-separation behaviour and a scenario without any material recycling. Results show that current recycling provides substantial environmental benefits compared to a non-recycling alternative. The environmental benefit varies greatly between recyclable fractions, and the recyclables currently most frequently source-separated by households are often not the most beneficial from an environmental perspective. With optimal source-separation of all recyclables, the current net contribution to global warming could be changed to a net-avoidance while current avoidance of nutrient enrichment, acidification and photochemical ozone formation could be <b>doubled.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> analyses show that thetype of energy substituted by incineration of non-recycled waste, as well as energy used in recycling processes and in the production of materials substituted by waste recycling, is of high relevance for the attained results...|$|R

As part of the investigation basic climate stations were operated during the 1989 and 1990 field seasons. Ablation and temperature data have served as input for a degree-day model covering the lowermost 1400 m of the glacier basin. By means of the model the mass-balance has been reconstructed back to 1949 using climatological time series from the coastal station Danmarkshavn. The results show no trend in mass-balance over the period from 1949 to 1991, although both mean annual temperature and precipitation had increased during the last 30 years.

40|$|When {{climate is}} forced by a {{doubling}} of CO 2, a number of feedback processes are induced, such as changes of water vapor, clouds, and surface albedo. Here the CO 2 forcing and concomitant feedbacks are studied individually using a general circulation model coupled to an aquaplanet mixed layer ocean. A technique for fixing the radiative effects of moisture and clouds by reusing these variables from 1 x CO 2 and 2 x CO 2 equilibrium climates in the model's radiation code allows for a detailed decomposition of forcings, feedbacks, and responses. The cloud feedback in this model is {{found to have a}} weak global average effect and surface albedo feedbacks have been eliminated. As in previous studies, the water vapor feedback is found to approximately <b>double</b> climate <b>sensitivity,</b> but while its radiative effect is strongly amplified at low latitudes, the resulting response displays about the same degree of polar amplification as the full all-feedbacks experiment. In fact, atmospheric energy transports are found to change in a way that yields the same meridional pattern of response as when the water vapor feedback is turned off. The authors conclude that while the water vapor feedback does not in itself lead to polar amplification by increasing the ratio of high-to low-latitude warming, it does <b>double</b> climate <b>sensitivity</b> both at low and high latitudes.
