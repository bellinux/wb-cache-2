The seminar was held under the European Commission’s project <b>Inventing</b> <b>tomorrow</b> which aimed to propose guidelines for the Fifth research and technical development framework programme. National focal points were requested by the European Commission Drugs Coordination Unit and the EMCDDA to prepare ‘national reports on the national drug research situation and identification of research needs. ' The results of this initiative are presented in this report. The current document presents an analytic summary of the 16 reports which have been produced {{in the context of}} the joint EU-EMCDDA initiative ‘National drug research situation and identification of research needs’. The document has a purely academic character in that it intends to analytically summarize the information provided in the different reports...|$|E

(Shove and Pantzer 2005 : 43) “I don’t want to use a walking stick, it will make me look and feel old”, (Vera, 76, Germany) The Health Research and Innovation (HRI) division of the Digital Health Group at Intel is chartered with understanding people’s health needs and aspirations worldwide across the continuum of care. Understanding their daily practices, processes, values and systems helps us <b>invent</b> and test <b>tomorrow’s</b> health and wellness technologies and usage models. The HRI teams in Ireland and the US are currently involved in a number of local and global projects exploring how technology innovation can help support independent living practice and develop culturally and contextually appropriate enhancements that contribute towards wellbeing and a life of quality for older people. Intel's ongoing Global Ageing Experience (GAE) Project and its recent Material Culture and Ageing in Ireland (MCI) study, both utilise a practices-based approach to research. The GAE study of the everyday lives of older people in twelve countries around the world is already producing substantial insights into the interplay between activity, social networks, health and household routines and perceptions of ageing. To complement this cross national research, a deeper small area project Community Supports for Ageing i...|$|R
