25|$|Different populations within Cape <b>Dwarf</b> <b>Chameleons</b> {{were found}} to have {{different}} preferences regarding Perch Diameter. The two main populations, Kogelberg and Stellenbosch, were seen to have different behavior. Kogelberg tended to use perches that were significantly wider on average than perches used by the Stellenbosch site which chose perches by random. Hand size has a direct correlation with grip strength on both broad and narrow dowels, rod-like structures, in both populations. The longer the tail length, the greater the strength. This species prefers to sleep on perches of specific diameters that correspond to their specific morphology. Animals from habitats characterized by wider perches are also stronger than their counterparts living in habitats with narrow branches. This has led to sexual selection for chameleons with specific traits like hand size and tail length.|$|E
25|$|The Cape Dwarf Chameleon is {{currently}} experiencing habitat loss and fragmentation of its natural habitat through causes such as urbanization and agriculture. The historical habitat of Bradypodion pumilum has recently become severely fragmented due to intense urbanization and agricultural transformation. This trend is continuing with approximately 6.5 square kilometers of undeveloped land becoming lost to {{transformation in the}} Cape Town municipal area per year. Additional losses are expected to occur because of rapid climatic changes near Cape town {{which is where the}} species is primarily distributed. In urban areas, Cape <b>Dwarf</b> <b>Chameleons</b> are limited to planted vegetation, usually nonindigenous species, and patches of highly disturbed habitat. Populations are often found living in the overgrowth of exotic vegetation on road verges, abandoned urban ground, riverine thickets, or residential areas. Part of the species distribution lies in habitats that are protected by provincial parks, national parks, and private reserves. This protected area only amounts to 40% of the total area of occupancy. Most of the shrubland found in these protected areas are fire-prone, and natural fires are known to be detrimental to dwarf chameleon populations.|$|E
