2500|$|Maddux {{has been}} {{credited}} {{by many of}} his teammates with a superior ability to outthink his opponents and anticipate results. Braves catcher Eddie Pérez {{tells the story of}} Maddux intentionally allowing a home run to the Astros's Jeff Bagwell, in anticipation of facing Bagwell in the playoffs months later. Maddux felt Bagwell would instinctively be looking for the same pitch again, which Maddux would then refuse to throw. On another occasion while sitting on the bench, Maddux once told his teammates, [...] "Watch this, we might need to call an ambulance for the first base coach." [...] The batter, Los Angeles' José Hernández, drove the next pitch into the chest of the Dodgers' first base coach. Maddux had noticed that Hernández, who'd been pitched inside by Braves pitching during the series, had shifted his batting stance slightly. On another occasion, a former teammate, outfielder Marquis Grissom, recalled a game in 1996 when Maddux was having trouble spotting his fastball. Between innings, he told Grissom, [...] "Gary Sheffield <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>next</b> inning. I am going to throw him a slider and make him just miss it so he hits it to the warning track." [...] The at-bat went as Maddux had predicted.|$|E

5000|$|Māori Television, the Maori Language channel. Skits {{were based}} on the 'originality of the channel' showing a line-up of what <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>next</b> with shows that seemed very {{familiar}} to English ones, for example, 'Kuia Eye for the Maori Guy' similar to Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. There was also a documentary, funded at around $2 million by the government, about the Maori history of New Zealand. The money was obviously used for other purposes as the show was filmed with plastic toys on a New Zealand map at Aunty Donna's place (a possible reference to Donna Awatere Huata) in five or so minutes. The show parodied the recent debate over whether or not the Maori people were the first to New Zealand by stating, [...] "…there were some natives here before that, but a giant shark came and ate them". The 'giant shark' excuse was also used about the death of the native birds in New Zealand, such as the Moa and Giant Eagle which were hunted to extinction by Maori.|$|R

50|$|Tahitian {{drumming}} compositions {{are composed}} of single rhythmic phrases that Tahitians call pehe. There are three parts of a pehe, each serving a different purpose. The first segment, fa’atomora’a, is an introductory phrase. It is a quick snippet that is played to announce which pehe it will be. It does this with rhythm and by being played on a certain instrument. Additionally, it also announces {{if there is any}} potential change to the program order at that time. The second segment of the pehe is the main rhythm pattern. The last part is the toma, which is the ending pattern. There are varieties of patterns to choose from and the choice determines the appropriate movement for the dancers and the number of pulses to expect before quickly ending the piece. Some pehe are used as fillers and transition periods without any choreography, but they still cue the dancers for what <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E

50|$|The musical {{begins with}} a {{performance}} by the band No Vacancy. The band's guitarist, Dewey Finn, repeatedly attempts to upstage the lead singer ("I'm Too Hot for You.") which leads the band to chastise him for his antics. Dewey argues that the band wouldn't exist without him, but the lead singer replaces him, knowing that the prestigious Battle of the Bands <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up.</b> The <b>next</b> morning, Dewey is awoken in his bedroom by his longtime friend, Ned Schneebly, and Ned's domineering girlfriend, Patty Di Marco. Patty demands rent from Dewey while Ned cowers behind her. They give Dewey thirty days to get the rent money. After they leave, Dewey dreams about getting his break and becoming a superstar ("When I Climb to the Top of Mount Rock.") Afterwards, Dewey receives a call from Rosalie Mullins, principal of the prestigious Horace Green School. She asks to speak to Ned, saying that the school has an open substitute teacher position that will pay over nine hundred dollars a week—enough to meet the rent. Dewey, pretending to be Ned, accepts.|$|R

40|$|Sandia National Laboratories has {{undertaken}} an ambitious, multiyear effort to greatly improve our parachute system modeling and analysis capabilities. The impetus for this effort is twofold. First, extending the stockpile lifetime raises serious {{questions regarding the}} ability of the parachutes to meet their requirements in the future due to material aging. These aging questions cannot currently be answered using available tools and techniques which are based upon the experience of expert staff and full-scale flight tests and are, therefore, not predictive. Second, the atrophy of our parachute technology base and the loss of our experienced staff has eroded our ability to respond to any future problems with stockpiled parachutes or to rapidly design a new parachute system on an experience base alone. To assure a future in-house capability for technical oversight of stockpile nuclear weapon parachutes, Sandia must move from our present empirically based approach to a computationally based, predictive methodology. This paper discusses the current status of the code development and experimental validation activities. Significant milestones that have been achieved and those that <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> in the <b>next</b> year are discussed...|$|R
