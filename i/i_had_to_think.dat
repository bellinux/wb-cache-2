500|$|In [...] "" [...] (1993), MacLeod and Tessa {{search for}} {{information}} about newborn Immortal Alfred Cahill (Martin Kemp). Becoming Immortal has made Cahill insane; he believes he is an angel sent by God to free the world from sin. Cahill starts with the last prostitute he met, Tessa's old friend, Elaine Trent (Sandra Nelson). Tessa is angry to learn the fate of her intelligent, beautiful friend, but later realizes that she [...] " [...] like her judge and jury." [...] MacLeod believes {{that the only way}} to stop Cahill is to behead him, despite Tessa's opinion that [...] "Enlightened societies don't kill their insane. They treat them." [...] When Cahill comes to the barge looking for MacLeod and finds Tessa alone, Tessa diverts him by welcoming Cahill as a messenger of God. Later, she tells MacLeod with disgust, [...] "I had to crawl inside his head... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> like him... I had to become like him." ...|$|E

Finn Jones, who was cast concurrently in the leading role for the upcoming television series Marvel's Iron Fist, spoke about his departure saying, [...] "I had been on Thrones for six years. It was yearly employment. Now I was at a crossroads and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of what the future is. I was very blessed {{that something like this}} has come along at the right moment," [...] referring to Iron Fist. Eugene Simon also spoke about his learning of his departure, saying that the showrunners promised a [...] "huge scene" [...] for his character in the season finale, with Simon responding, [...] "for everything that you've done for the last six years, thank you. This is a wonderful way to go. I really, really appreciate it, and I look forward to doing it for you." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MistaJam, Tempah cites Dizzee Rascal and So Solid Crew as influences for the album, who've influenced him since his childhood. He also told Capital that Daft Punk influenced the album. Speaking about the album title Demonstration, Tinie {{said that it was}} about him compromising to make an album that was both true to where he came from and follows the trappings of mainstream hip hop: [...] "Anyone who wants to take inspiration from it can have a sort of example based on my experiences of how to do this. So basically, do something that still nods to where you've come from, still feels very London, still feels very British, but kind of meets the criteria of what a mainstream record needs." [...] He also commented oh how things change when signing with a record label and how the process of making albums: [...] "The first time around, you don't really know. All you do is you get this record deal and you're like whoa! Like, I'm signed! This is amazing! And you're just recording {{and before you know it}} the album's done. This time around, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about so much more things, you know: edits, production things that I didn't like, going back and forth on mixing.... I was very hands-on this time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, Nou, {{it would}} not be right. I may lift no hand against my own life, or if perchance <b>I</b> may, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of another life." ...|$|R
60|$|TENCH. [With {{the ghost}} of a smile.] No, sir; of course I've got my children, and my wife's delicate; in my {{position}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of these things.|$|R
6000|$|The {{tenderness}} {{of woman}} let her hand glide over his cheek. She was {{not ashamed of}} her love. [...] "O Alan," [...] she cried, [...] "if it were only for myself, I could trust you with my life; I could trust you with anything. But I haven't only myself <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of right and wrong; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the world; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the cause which almost wholly hangs upon me. Not for nothing are these impulses implanted in my breast. They are {{the voice of the}} soul of all women within me. If I were to neglect them for the sake of gratifying your wishes,--if I were to turn traitor to my sex {{for the sake of the}} man I love, as so many women have turned before me, I should hate and despise myself. I couldn't love you, Alan, quite so much, loved I not honor more, and the battle imposed upon me." ...|$|R

2500|$|The role of Karen White was {{the other}} part cast early in the process. Actress Vicky McClure admitted, [...] "It was quite a {{difficult}} role to take on and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> quite carefully about it." [...] To help her get into character, McClure specifically asked that the hair designers give her artificial hair integrations.|$|E
2500|$|When I {{first got}} picked for South Australia, Ian said, [...] "You {{got to decide}} what sort of a player {{you want to be}} – whether you want to be an aggressive, attacking player, or more like a {{grafting}} sort of player." [...] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about that and that I'm not really a free hitter of the ball, so the choice I made was I was going {{to be more of a}} grafter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jest {{a mile or}} so. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of you, you know. I {{should feel}} more easy. If we was locked up, you know--Not that I should mind on my own account--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} does. <b>I</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> known {{that it would}} be so with such a one as him. And then she is rich also--wonderfully rich! What right can <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I mean altogether,' {{said the}} poor girl, unable {{to be quite}} as {{explicit}} with her brother, {{as she had been}} with her father, and mother, and sister. 'Of course <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of myself.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1931, Gimbutas {{settled with}} her parents in Kaunas, the {{temporary}} capital of Lithuania, where she continued her studies. After her parents separated that year, she lived {{with her mother and}} brother, Vytautas, in Kaunas. Five years later, her father died suddenly. At her father's deathbed, Gimbutas pledged that she would study to become a scholar: [...] "All of a sudden <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> what I shall be, what I shall do with my life. I had been so reckless in sports—swimming for miles, skating, bicycle riding. I changed completely and began to read." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, Fo and Rame {{began their}} third theatre group, Collettivo Teatrale [...] "La Comune" [...] with the {{musician}} Paolo Ciarchi and the administrator Nanni Ricordi. They based themselves at an abandoned workshop (capannone) in via Colletta in a working-class suburb of Milan for three years, converting {{it into a}} sort of community centre and producing plays based on improvisation about contemporary issues. One such play was Vorrei morire stasera se dovessi pensare che non è servito a niente (I'd Rather Die Tonight If <b>I</b> <b>Had</b> <b>To</b> <b>Think</b> It Had All Been In Vain). Inspired by the Black September, with the title derived from a Renata Viganò poem, thousands of people came to see it.|$|E
2500|$|I {{think it}} was the first summer I was at Harvard as a student, and I {{discovered}} a wonderful bookstore there where I could get modern poetry – which I'd never been able to lay my hands on very much until then – and they had the original edition of The Darkening Ecliptic with the Sidney Nolan cover. [...] I always had a taste for sort of wild experimental poetry – of which there really wasn't very much in English in America at the time – and this poet suited me very well. [...] I am obliged to give a final examination in my poetry writing course , which I'm always rather hard put to do, since we haven't really studied anything. The students have been writing poems of varying degrees of merit, and though I give them reading lists they tend to ignore them, after first demanding them. And the way the course is set up {{there is no way of}} examining them on their reading. And anyway they shouldn't have to pass an examination because they're poets who are writing poetry, and I don't like the idea of grading poems. So in order to pass the examination time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of various subterfuges, and one of them is to use one of Malley's poems and another forbiddingly modern poem – frequently one of Geoffrey Hill's 'Mercian Hymns'. And asking them if they can guess which one is the real poem by a respected contemporary poet, and which one is a put-on intended to ridicule modern poetry, and what are their reasons. And I think they are right about fifty per cent of the time, identifying the fraud... fraudulent poem.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{again of}} being more deserving {{of his love}} and his affliction before I could go on.|$|E
60|$|Again <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the Italian soul, {{how it is}} dark, {{cleaving}} to {{the eternal}} night. It seems to have become so, at the Renaissance, after the Renaissance.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear child," [...] I said, [...] "don't {{forget that}} I am your guardian, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> for you--a long way ahead. As for the rest, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{not a single}} thought or hope in life which is not {{concerned}} for your happiness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a course. It was {{imperative}} {{that we should}} stay together a little while, to avoid the scandal to you that would have resulted from our immediate parting. But you must see it is only for form's sake." ...|$|R
6000|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.

6000|$|... 'Then Walen whirls in. He'd been bitin' {{his nails}} in a corner. We was all nerved up by now.... Me? The {{worst of the}} bunch. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> for Tommy as well.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed I did, dear. But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of {{what was}} good for him. I went to his room {{the next day when}} he was awake, and the Doctor let me come in for only a moment.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{turned away}} from them, put my foot on the fender, stuck my elbow on the plush-fringed mantelboard, and studied the photographs, pipes, and ash-trays that adorned it. What was it <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> out before I went to the station? ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2017, Bob Dylan {{was asked}} {{about how he was}} {{referenced}} in the song. [...] "A jester? Sure, the jester writes songs like 'Masters of War,' 'A Hard Rain’s a-Gonna Fall,' 'It’s Alright, Ma' - some jester. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> he’s talking about somebody else. Ask him." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> been exercising {{my right}} to vote all my life, but on this occasion, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> hard on what <b>I</b> need <b>to</b> do...I <b>have</b> not {{made up my mind}} yet...This (by-election)is {{deliberately}} engineered through resignation and re-election of the same people in order to introduce what they call a so-called referendum...It is a completely different texture altogether...We must understand this very carefully, so <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> very hard about my position. ... My duty is to the people. Audrey Eu said that Tsang's remarks were inappropriate, and that judging from the Beijing's heavy-handed reactions, the de facto referendum would be a success. [...] Wong Yuk-man, of the League of Social Democrats said any Tsang boycott may spark a bigger turnout at the polls. [...] Ronny Tong asked whether Tsang had broken the law by declaring he might not vote.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the same}} time I thought to myself, [...] "I am not a director. No trust is reposed in me. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> first of dear Isabel and the baby. Before the crash comes I will sell out to-morrow the few shares I hold, through Charles's kindness, in the Cloetedorp Golcondas." ...|$|R
6000|$|Alton nodded. [...] "Yes," [...] he said. [...] "He had {{his grip}} {{right on the}} deerhide bag, as though he didn't want to let me have them, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of Mrs. Jimmy while I took them from him. It didn't seem quite fair of Jimmy, because they haven't much use for silver in the country the long trail leads to." ...|$|E
60|$|We heard loud acclamations, {{which made}} us think {{something}} unusual was going on, {{and it was}} the publication of this precious edict. I wondered who they thought was going to attend to it when M. Darpent brought in a copy. And my mother began to cry and talk about Lord Strafford. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of Eustace and bite my tongue to keep my patience at our noble 'thorough' Wentworth being likened to that base cringing Italian.|$|E
60|$|He {{drew from}} his pocket the thing that he had hidden from me. This time, there was no concealment; he {{let me see that}} he was opening a razor. It was no time for asserting my innocence; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of {{preserving}} my life. When a man is without firearms, what defense can avail against a razor {{in the hands of a}} madman? A chair was at my side; it offered the one poor means of guarding myself that I could see. I laid my hand on it, and kept my eye on him.|$|E
