5|$|Horses have a {{great sense}} of balance, due partly to their ability to <b>feel</b> <b>their</b> footing and partly to highly {{developed}} proprioception—the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times. A horse's sense of touch is well developed. The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose. Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.|$|E

25|$|Academic studies {{report that}} many Japanese Brazilians felt (and were often treated) as Japanese in Brazil. But {{when they move}} to Japan, they realize that they {{strongly}} <b>feel</b> <b>their</b> Brazilian background. In Brazil, Japanese Brazilians rarely listened to samba or participated in a carnival parade. However, once in Japan, Japanese Brazilians often promote carnivals and samba festivities in the Japanese cities to demonstrate their pride of being Brazilian.|$|E
25|$|Like many breeds of island sheep, Santa Cruz sheep are {{relatively}} small and extremely hardy: they are good foragers and need no assistance with lambing. However, because of the fine–wooled breeds that they are derived from, Santa Cruz sheep are unique among formerly feral island breeds in their medium to fine wool with a soft <b>feel.</b> <b>Their</b> fleeces are mostly white, but some colored sheep are known among the breed.|$|E
25|$|The superior–subordinate {{relationship}} {{is an important}} relational factor. Employees who perceive they have a higher-quality relationship with their supervisors are more often to use articulated dissent. They <b>feel</b> <b>their</b> supervisors respect their opinions {{and that they have}} mutual influence and persuasion over the outcome of organizational decisions. Conversely, employees that perceive their relationship with their supervisor as low-quality will resort to latent dissent. They feel that there is no room to voice their opinions (Kassing, 2000).|$|E

25|$|Emotional abuse {{includes}} minimising, threats, isolation, public humiliation, unrelenting criticism, constant personal devaluation, repeated stonewalling and gaslighting. Stalking is {{a common}} form of psychological intimidation, and is most often perpetrated by former or current intimate partners. Victims tend to <b>feel</b> <b>their</b> partner has nearly total control over them, greatly affecting the power dynamic in a relationship, empowering the perpetrator, and disempowering the victim. Victims often suffer from depression, putting them at increased risk of eating disorders, suicide, and drug and alcohol abuse.|$|E
25|$|In {{the evening}} of 25 October 1983 by telephone, on the {{newscast}} Nightline, anchor Ted Koppel spoke to medical students on Grenada who stated that they were safe and did not <b>feel</b> <b>their</b> lives were in danger. The next evening, again by telephone, medical students told Koppel how grateful they were for the invasion and the Army Rangers, which probably saved their lives. State Department officials had assured the medical students {{that they would be}} able to complete their medical school education in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Neutral {{buoyancy}} is {{not identical}} to weightlessness. Gravity still acts on all objects {{in a neutral}} buoyancy tank; thus, astronauts in neutral buoyancy training still <b>feel</b> <b>their</b> full body weight within their spacesuits, although the weight is well-distributed, similar to force on a human body in a water bed, or when simply floating in water. The suit and astronaut together are under no net force, as for any object that is floating, or supported in water, such as a scuba diver at neutral buoyancy. Water also produces drag, which is not present in vacuum.|$|E

25|$|Navigators {{traveled}} to small inhabited islands using only their own senses and knowledge passed by oral tradition from navigator to apprentice. In order to locate directions {{at various times}} of day and year, navigators in Eastern Polynesia memorized important facts: the motion of specific stars, and where they would rise on the horizon of the ocean; weather; times of travel; wildlife species (which congregate at particular positions); directions of swells on the ocean, and how the crew would <b>feel</b> <b>their</b> motion; colors {{of the sea and}} sky, especially how clouds would cluster at the locations of some islands; and angles for approaching harbors.|$|E
25|$|While all wasp stings are unpleasant, {{the sting}} of R. romandi is known for being very painful. Additionally, because R. romandi is a paper wasp, it {{has the ability to}} {{repeatedly}} sting without dying. R. romandi is most aggressive if they are swarming, if their nests are disturbed or if the wasps <b>feel</b> <b>their</b> nest is threatened. If wasps feel threatened, they may swarm out of the nest, and pursue the aggressor. If you ever get swarmed by wasps, it is recommended that you remain as still as possible and move away slowly. Sudden movements will be regarded as aggressive acts and will result in more stings.|$|E
25|$|Normally, the pyloric valve at {{the lower}} end of the stomach regulates the release of food into the bowel. When the gastric bypass patient eats a sugary food, the sugar passes rapidly into the intestine, where it gives rise to a {{physiological}} reaction called dumping syndrome. The body will flood the intestines with gastric content in an attempt to dilute the sugars. An affected person may <b>feel</b> <b>their</b> heart beating rapidly and forcefully, break into a cold sweat, get a feeling of butterflies in the stomach, and may have an anxiety attack. The person usually has to lie down, and could be very uncomfortable for 3045 minutes. Diarrhea may then follow.|$|E

5000|$|An {{electoral system}} which reduces {{the number of}} wasted votes can be {{considered}} desirable {{on grounds of fairness}} or on the more pragmatic basis that a voter who <b>feels</b> <b>their</b> vote has made no difference may <b>feel</b> detached from <b>their</b> government or lose confidence in the democratic process. The term [...] "wasted vote" [...] is especially used by advocates of systems like the single transferable vote, or instant-runoff voting which purport to reduce the numbers of such votes.|$|R
25|$|The {{long history}} of the West in popular culture tends to define those clothed in Western {{clothing}} as cowboys or cowgirls whether they have ever been on a horse or not. This is especially true when applied to entertainers {{and those in the}} public arena who wear western wear as part of their persona. However, the reality is that many people, particularly in the West, including lawyers, bankers, and other white collar professionals wear elements of Western clothing, particularly cowboy boots or hats, as a matter of form even though they have other jobs. Conversely, some people raised on ranches do not necessarily define themselves cowboys or cowgirls unless they <b>feel</b> <b>their</b> primary job is to work with livestock or if they compete in rodeos.|$|E
25|$|The 28th Brigade, {{supported}} by the 92nd Punjabis, attacked the Ottoman positions on the right bank, while 19th and 35th Brigades attacked the Ottoman defenses on the right. Younghusband's forces had only a vague idea as to where the Ottoman positions were. Lacking any elevated ground, effective aerial reconnaissance, or sufficient cavalry, the British and Indian troops had to <b>feel</b> <b>their</b> to discover where the Ottoman positions started and ended. Trying to manage the battle {{on both sides of}} the river, Younghusband was unable to effectively manage his forces. On the right bank, Kemball's forces attempted to flank the Ottoman positions, but ended up attacking the center of defenses. Meanwhile, on the left bank Rice's brigade was ordered only to probe the Ottoman lines.|$|E
25|$|According to the JCT, an {{organization}} that provides workers with sufficient levels of skill variety (using different skills and talents in performing work), task identity (contributing to a clearly identifiable larger project), and task significance (impacting the lives or work of other people) {{is likely to have}} workers who <b>feel</b> <b>their</b> work has meaning and value. Sufficiently high levels of autonomy (independence, freedom and discretion in carrying out the job) will inspire the worker to feel responsibility for the work; and sufficiently high levels of Task Feedback (receiving timely, clear, specific, detailed, actionable information about the effectiveness of his or her job performance) will inspire the worker to feel the organization is authentically interested in helping to foster his/her professional development and growth. The combined effect of these psychological states results in desired personal and work outcomes: intrinsic motivation, job satisfaction, performance quality, low absenteeism, and low turnover rate.|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to look at}} {{the dynamic}} of mother-adolescent closeness, and to {{exploring}} the reasons why the adolescents <b>feel</b> close to <b>their</b> mother.

25|$|Alan reveals to Dysart {{that during}} his youth, he had {{established}} his attraction to horses {{by way of}} his mother's biblical tales, a horse story that she had read to him, Western movies, and his grandfather's interest in horses and riding. Alan's sexual training began with his mother who {{told him he could}} find true love and contentment by way of religious devotion and marriage. During this time, Alan also begins to develop a sexual attraction to horses, desiring to pet their thick coats, <b>feel</b> <b>their</b> muscular bodies, and smell their sweat. Alan reveals to Dysart that he had first encountered a horse at age six, on the beach. A rider approached him, and took him up on the horse. Alan was visibly excited, but his parents found him and Frank pulled him violently off the horse. The horse rider scoffed at the father and rode off.|$|E
25|$|A {{higher than}} average {{concentration}} of hagwon in the Gangnam-gu (강남구) area, specifically Daechi-dong (대치동), has been cited as {{the primary reason for}} an increase in real estate costs in the area. In the 1970s the Seoul government made some top schools relocate to the area; however, the schools there have become associated with entry into elite high schools and then elite universities. Many residents <b>feel</b> <b>their</b> children need to be associated with these schools in order to reach the upper levels of business and success. As more parents try to move to the area to allow their children to attend these schools, the prices of real estate in the area have risen to 300percent of similar areas in Seoul. In 2003 the government had planned to develop a hagwon center in Pangyo to relieve some of the pressure on Gangnam, yet after heavy criticism for only shifting the problem around and not solving it, the government canceled the plan only a couple weeks later.|$|E
25|$|Japan Air Lines flight 1628 was a UFO {{incident}} that occurred on November 17, 1986 involving a Japanese Boeing 747 cargo aircraft. The aircraft {{was en route}} from Paris to Narita International Airport, near Tokyo, with a cargo of Beaujolais wine. On the Reykjavík to Anchorage section of the flight, at 17:11 over eastern Alaska, the crew first witnessed two unidentified objects to their left. These abruptly rose from below and closed in to escort their aircraft. Each had two rectangular arrays of {{what appeared to be}} glowing nozzles or thrusters, though their bodies remained obscured by darkness. When closest, the aircraft's cabin was lit up and the captain could <b>feel</b> <b>their</b> heat on his face. These two craft departed before a third, much larger disk-shaped object started trailing them, causing the pilots to request a change of course. Anchorage Air Traffic Control obliged and requested an oncoming United Airlines flight to confirm the unidentified traffic, but when it and a military craft sighted JAL 1628 at about 17:51, no other craft could be distinguished. The sighting of 50 minutes ended in the vicinity of Denali (formerly Mount McKinley).|$|E

40|$|Of nine {{exhibits}} in the Quality of Life with Diabetes poster {{event at}} the recent European Association for the Study of Diabetes meeting in Jerusalem, 1 five used measures of health status (EQ 5 D and SF- 36) and two others used measures of well-being (W-BQ 22). All nine referred to the measures used as quality-of-life measures. The EQ 5 D 2 and SF- 363 measure how people <b>feel</b> about <b>their</b> health (physical and mental) and the W-BQ 224 measures feelings of depression, anxiety, energy, and positive well-being. If people <b>feel</b> that <b>their</b> health or well-being is poor, they may <b>feel</b> that <b>their</b> {{quality of life is}} also impaired, though this is not necessarily the case. The opposite – that just because they <b>feel</b> that <b>their</b> health is excellent and they are not depressed or anxious, their quality of life is excellent – may not be true either...|$|R
