40|$|While {{studies on}} {{residential}} concentrations of <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> non-industrial countries are now common, studies of residential concentrations of <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> industrial countries are less common and comparative studies are almost nonexistent. This paper will apply identical research methods to {{both types of}} immigrants. By making a detailed comparison of the geography of seven ethnic groups in Amsterdam between 1994 and 2001, it is shown that <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> non-industrial countries are not extremely segregated, while <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> industrial countries show higher levels of concentration. Residential concentration levels do not necessarily tell us anything {{about the level of}} economic success and social/civil integration, because the different spheres of integration do not run parallel. However, concentrations of <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> nonindustrial countries often intersect with low levels of neighbourhood satisfaction, and concentrations of <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> industrial countries with high levels of neighbourhood satisfaction. status: publishe...|$|R

Furthermore, economic factors {{seem to have a}} stronger influence on naturalisation of <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> non-Western countries. For them, the position in the job is positively and blue-collar employment is negatively correlated with the naturalisation probability. These determinants are not significant in the sample of Western European immigrants.|$|R

She had three brothers born before her, but one died in infancy and another at age three. Ferraro attended the parochial school Mount Saint Mary's in Newburgh when she was young. Her father {{died of a heart}} attack in , when she was eight. Ferraro's mother soon invested and lost the remainder of the family's money, forcing the family to move to a low-income area in the South Bronx while Ferraro's mother worked in the garment industry to support them.|$|E
5|$|Joppenbergh {{is named}} after Colonel Jacob Rutsen, born Jacobsen Rutger van Schoonderwoerdt. Rutsen was a merchant, {{and the son of}} a Dutch <b>immigrant,</b> <b>from</b> Albany; he founded the first {{settlement}} in what is now the town of Rosendale, New York, in the late 17thcentury. The spelling of the mountain's name has been disputed, and has been rendered as Joppenberg and Joppenburgh. It has also been called Jacob's Nose, Jacob's Mount, and, in an early 18th-century deed, Jobsenbright.|$|E
5|$|The three paleontologists Xiaoming Wang, Richard H. Tedford, and Ronald M. Nowak have {{proposed}} that C.dirus evolved from Canis armbrusteri, with Nowak stating that specimens found in Cumberland Cave, Maryland, appear to be C.armbrusteri diverging into C.dirus. The early wolf from China, Canis chihliensis, {{may have been the}} ancestor of both C.armbrusteri and the gray wolf C.lupus. The sudden appearance of C.armbrusteri in North America during the Early Pleistocene suggests that this was an <b>immigrant</b> <b>from</b> Asia, as was C.lupus later in the Pleistocene. In 2010 Francisco Prevosti proposed that C.dirus was a sister taxon to C.lupus.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Carnegie, an <b>immigrant</b> <b>from</b> Scotland, {{a former}} Pennsylvania Railroad {{executive}} turned steel magnate, founded the Carnegie Steel Company. He proceeded {{to play a}} key role in the development of the U.S. steel industry. He became a philanthropist: in 1890, he established the first Carnegie Library, in a program to establish libraries in numerous cities and towns by the incentive of matching funds. In 1895, he founded the Carnegie Institute. In 1901, as the U.S. Steel Corporation formed, he sold his mills to J.P. Morgan for $250 million, making him one of the world's richest men. Carnegie once wrote that a man who dies rich, dies disgraced. He devoted the rest of his life to public service, establishing libraries, trusts, and foundations. In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Maastrichtian, albertosaurines {{appear to have}} gone extinct, while the tyrannosaurine Tyrannosaurus roamed from Saskatchewan to Texas. This pattern is {{mirrored}} in other North American dinosaur taxa. During the Campanian and early Maastrichtian, lambeosaurine hadrosaurs and centrosaurine ceratopsians are common in the northwest, while hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines were more common to the south. By {{the end of the}} Cretaceous, centrosaurines are unknown and lambeosaurines are rare, while hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines were common throughout the Western Interior. A study published in the journal Scientific Reports on February 2, 2016 by Steve Brusatte, Thomas Carr et al. indicates that during the later Maastrichtian, Tyrannosaurus itself might have been partially responsible for the extinction of the other tyrannosaurids in most of western North America. The study indicates that Tyrannosaurus might have been an <b>immigrant</b> <b>from</b> Asia as opposed to having evolved in North America (possibly a descendent of the closely related Tarbosaurus) that supplanted and outcompeted other tyrannosaurids. This theory is further supported by the fact that few to no other types of tyrannosaurid are found within Tyrannosaurus known range.|$|E
5|$|Dora Caroline Stevens {{was born}} on October 26, 1888 in Omaha, Nebraska to Caroline D. (née Koopman) and Henry Henderbourck Stevens. Her father was a pastor of the Dutch Reformed Church for forty years and {{her mother was a}} first {{generation}} <b>immigrant</b> <b>from</b> Holland. One of four children, Stevens grew up in Omaha and graduated in 1905 from Omaha High School. She went on to further her education graduating from Oberlin College in 1911 with a degree in sociology, though she had originally pursued music. While in college, she was known for her romances and for being a spirited suffragette. Her unruly behavior and disdain for feminine propriety were cultivated during her college years. After graduation, Stevens worked as a music teacher and social worker in Ohio, Michigan. and Montana before moving to Washington, D.C., where she became a regional organizer with the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA).|$|E

5|$|Georges, the {{youngest}} of eight children, was born on , 1887, in Chicoutimi, Quebec, to Jacques Vézina, a local baker and an <b>immigrant</b> <b>from</b> St. Nicolas de La Rochelle in France, and his wife Clara. Georges attended school at the Petit Séminaire de Chicoutimi {{until the age of}} fourteen, when he left the school to help at his father's bakery. He played hockey from a young age, participating in informal street hockey matches with others his own age. Vézina partook in these matches in his shoes, and used skates {{for the first time at}} age 16 when he joined the local team in Chicoutimi. As Chicoutimi was in a remote area of Quebec, more than 200 kilometres from Quebec City, the hockey club was not in any organised league. Rather the club, known as the Saguenéens ("People from the Saguenay", the region where Chicoutimi is located), toured the province, playing exhibition games against a variety of clubs.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} in the May 9, 1936 issue of Puerto Rico Ilustrado, Eugenio Astol {{described}} an 1823 incident between Cofresí and Puerto Rican physician and politician Pedro Gerónimo Goyco. The 15-year-old Goyco traveled alone on a schooner to a Santo Domingo school for his secondary education. In mid-voyage, Cofresí intercepted the ship and the pirates boarded it. Cofresí assembled the passengers, asking their names and those of their parents. When he learned that Goyco was among them, the pirate ordered a change of course; they landed on a beach near Mayagüez, where Goyco was freed. Cofresí explained that he knew Goyco's father, an <b>immigrant</b> <b>from</b> Herceg Novi named Gerónimo Goicovich who had settled in Mayagüez. Goyco returned home safely, later attempting the voyage again. The elder Goicovich had favored members of Cofresí's family, despite their association with a pirate. Goyco grew up to become a militant abolitionist, similar to Ramón Emeterio Betances and Segundo Ruiz Belvis.|$|E
5|$|Lansford W. Hastings, {{an early}} <b>immigrant</b> <b>from</b> Ohio to the West, went to California in 1842 {{and saw the}} promise of the undeveloped country. To {{encourage}} settlers, he published The Emigrants' Guide to Oregon and California. He described a direct route across the Great Basin which would bring immigrants through the Wasatch Mountains and across the Great Salt Lake Desert. Hastings had not traveled any part of his proposed shortcut until early 1846 on a trip from California to Fort Bridger. The fort was a scant supply station run by Jim Bridger and his partner Pierre Louis Vasquez in Blacks Fork, Wyoming. Hastings stayed at the fort to persuade travelers to turn south on his route. As of 1846, Hastings was the second of two men documented to have crossed {{the southern part of the}} Great Salt Lake Desert, but neither had been accompanied by wagons.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} impact of home country’s economic status on immigrant self-employment probability in the U. S. We estimate a probability model and find that, consistent across race, <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> developed countries {{are more likely to}} be self-employed in the U. S than are <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> developing countries. This result is unexpected given previous re-search which suggests that <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> countries with high levels of self-employment tend to be more involved in self-employment in the U. S. Developing countries, on average, have higher self-employment rates than do developed countries but our research shows that <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> developing countries have similar or lower self-employment probabilities relative to that of na-tive born White-Americans. In contrast, <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> developed countries have significantly higher self-employment probabilities relative to that of native born White-Americans. We pro-vide evidence that this result cannot be explained by differences in wealth or savings of imigrant. Instead, we hypothesize that institutional arrangements in the developed world may be similar across countries allowing <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> developed countries to have an informational or rele-vant skill advantage over <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> developing countries. This informational or skill ad-vantage makes it easier for <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> developed countries to transition to self-employment in the U. S.

5|$|Mostow, an <b>immigrant</b> <b>from</b> Uzbekistan with {{a history}} of {{involuntary}} commitment, is charged with killing seven men by mutilating their faces. Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) become involved in the investigation when Mostow insists that he was possessed during the killings; his claims are given credence when another murder occurs after his arrest. Mostow draws a gargoyle and claims it made him kill. The agents meet with Patterson who has spent three years on the case. Mulder knows Patterson from his time in the Investigative Support Unit at Quantico. Their relationship is tense, and Patterson is skeptical of Mulder's theories. Mulder and Scully go to Mostow's studio and discover a hidden room full of gargoyle sculptures, finding corpses within them.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} groups of Black Hebrews, the Church of God and Saints of Christ, was founded in Kansas in 1896, but it {{retained}} elements of a messianic connection to Jesus. During the following decades, many more Black Hebrew congregations were established, {{and some of them}} had no connection to Christianity. After World War I, for example, Wentworth Arthur Matthew, an <b>immigrant</b> <b>from</b> Saint Kitts, founded a Black Hebrew congregation in Harlem, claiming descent from the ancient Israelites. He called it the Commandment Keepers of the Living God. Similar groups selected elements of Judaism and adapted them within a structure {{similar to that of the}} Black church.

5|$|When Rand {{first arrived}} in New York as an <b>immigrant</b> <b>from</b> the Soviet Union in 1926, she was greatly {{impressed}} by the Manhattan skyline's towering skyscrapers, which she saw as symbols of freedom, and resolved that she would write about them. In 1927, Rand {{was working as a}} junior screenwriter for movie producer Cecil B. DeMille when he asked her to write a script for what would become the 1928 film Skyscraper. The original story by Dudley Murphy was about two construction workers working on a skyscraper who are rivals for a woman's love. Rand rewrote it, transforming the rivals into architects. One of them, Howard Kane, was an idealist dedicated to erecting the skyscraper despite enormous obstacles. The film would have ended with Kane standing atop the completed skyscraper. DeMille rejected Rand's script, and the completed film followed Murphy's original idea. Rand's version contained elements she would use in The Fountainhead.|$|E
