5|$|Beginning in 2014, a minor moral panic {{occurred}} over the Slender Man after readers of <b>his</b> <b>fiction</b> were connected to several violent acts, particularly a near-fatal stabbing of a 12-year-old girl in Waukesha, Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|Poe wrote much of {{his work}} using themes aimed {{specifically}} at mass-market tastes. To that end, <b>his</b> <b>fiction</b> often included elements of popular pseudosciences, such as phrenology and physiognomy.|$|E
5|$|Some scholars, notably Vladimir Nabokov, have reservations, often championing some of <b>his</b> <b>fiction</b> while condemning other works. In Nabokov's opinion, Ulysses was brilliant, Finnegans Wake horrible—an {{attitude}} Jorge Luis Borges shared.|$|E
50|$|He is {{probably}} best remembered for <b>his</b> sports <b>fiction,</b> particularly the young-readers' novels he began publishing in the early 1960s, and for <b>his</b> crime <b>fiction.</b>|$|R
50|$|As readers, we don't find {{explicit}} didacticism or moralist allegory in <b>his</b> <b>fictions.</b> César Fernández García {{believes that}} meaning in literature {{should be an}} undercurrent just beneath the surface.|$|R

5|$|The novelist Vladimir Nabokov {{was the son}} of a {{professional}} lepidopterist, and was interested in butterflies himself. He wrote his novel Lolita while travelling on his annual butterfly-collection trips in the western United States. He eventually became a leading lepidopterist. This is reflected in <b>his</b> <b>fiction,</b> where for example The Gift devotes two whole chapters (of five) to the tale of a father and son on a butterfly expedition.|$|E
5|$|In time, Prus {{adopted the}} French Positivist critic Hippolyte Taine's {{concept of the}} arts, {{including}} literature, as a second means, alongside the sciences, of studying reality, and he devoted more attention to his sideline of short-story writer. Prus' stories, which met with great acclaim, owed much to the literary influence of Polish novelist Józef Ignacy Kraszewski and, among English-language writers, to Charles Dickens and Mark Twain. <b>His</b> <b>fiction</b> would also be influenced by French writers Victor Hugo, Gustave Flaubert, Alphonse Daudet and Émile Zola.|$|E
5|$|Ion Agârbiceanu (September 12, 1882 – May 28, 1963) was an Austro-Hungarian-born Romanian writer, journalist, politician, theologian and Greek-Catholic priest. A {{native of}} Transylvania, he {{graduated}} from Budapest University, after which he was ordained. He was initially assigned to a parish in the Apuseni Mountains, which form the backdrop to much of <b>his</b> <b>fiction.</b> Before 1910, Agârbiceanu had achieved literary fame in both Transylvania and the Kingdom of Romania; his work was disputed between the rival schools of Sămănătorul and Poporanism.|$|E
50|$|David Hill (born 1942) is a New Zealand author, {{especially}} {{well known for}} <b>his</b> young adult <b>fiction.</b> <b>His</b> young <b>fiction</b> books See Ya, Simon (1992) and Right Where It Hurts (2001) have been shortlisted for numerous awards. He is also a prolific journalist, writing many articles for The New Zealand Herald.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} a lot of vivid details about the customs of the Suzhou region, which earns <b>his</b> <b>fictions</b> an {{reputation}} of Suzhou literature. Up to now, this novel has been translated into English, French, Japanese, etc., introducing Chinese traditions to the outside world.|$|R
5000|$|<b>His</b> first <b>fiction</b> book, Kicked to Death by a Camel (1973), was {{nominated}} for an Edgar for [...] "Best First Mystery". <b>His</b> other <b>fiction</b> includes Tomb of the Twelfth Imam (1979), The Gulf Scenario (1984), The Sufi Fiddle (1991), and The One-Donkey Solution (2011).|$|R
5|$|Savage {{followed}} {{his first book}} with Delilah of Harlem, The Mask of Venus, Our Mysterious Passenger and Other Stories and In the Shadow of the Pyramids. In addition to <b>his</b> <b>fiction</b> prose output, Savage published collections of his speeches and essays, and in 1895 wrote a book of poetry dedicated to his wife: After Many Years. Savage's writing style was fast and precise: he wrote from morning to night and rarely needed to correct his first drafts. He was able {{to carry on a}} conversation while writing. He joined the Author's Guild of America in 1894.|$|E
5|$|Talbot Baines Reed (3 April 1852– 28 November 1893) was an English {{writer of}} boys' fiction who {{established}} a genre of school stories that endured into the mid-20th century. Among his best-known work is The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's. He {{was a regular}} and prolific contributor to The Boy's Own Paper (B.O.P.), in which most of <b>his</b> <b>fiction</b> first appeared. Through his family's business, Reed became a prominent typefounder, and wrote a standard work on the subject: History of the Old English Letter Foundries.|$|E
5|$|Walpole's books cover a wide range. <b>His</b> <b>fiction</b> {{includes}} short stories, bildungsromane (Mr Perrin and Mr Traill, 1911, and the Jeremy trilogy) that {{delve into}} the psychology of boyhood; gothic horror novels (Portrait of a Man with Red Hair, 1925, and The Killer and The Slain, 1942); a period family saga (the Herries chronicle) and even detective fiction (Behind the Screen). He wrote literary biographies (Conrad, 1916; James Branch Cabell, 1920; and Trollope, 1928); plays; and screenplays including David Copperfield, 1935.|$|E

5|$|Balzac {{began using}} {{characters}} from earlier works in his 1835 novel Le Père Goriot, {{and made the}} technique a hallmark of <b>his</b> <b>fiction.</b> In the case of Z. Marcas, the narrator– Charles Rabourdin, whose identity is only revealed {{at the end of}} the story– is in fact the son of a central character from Balzac's 1837 tale La Femme supérieure. The title character of that story is married to Xavier Rabourdin, who is unjustly ignored for a promotion to the head of his civil service department. At the end of the La Femme supérieure, Rabourdin pledges to his wife that they will enjoy success in the world of business. His son's poverty in Z. Marcas is evidence of his failure.|$|E
5|$|Gibson's {{work has}} {{influenced}} several popular musicians: references to <b>his</b> <b>fiction</b> {{appear in the}} music of Stuart Hamm, Billy Idol, Warren Zevon, Deltron 3030, Straylight Run (whose name is derived from a sequence in Neuromancer) and Sonic Youth. U2's Zooropa album was heavily influenced by Neuromancer, and the band at one point planned to scroll the text of Neuromancer above them on a concert tour, although this did not end up happening. Members of the band did, however, provide background music for the audiobook version of Neuromancer as well as appearing in No Maps for These Territories, a biographical documentary of Gibson. He returned the favour by writing {{an article about the}} band's Vertigo Tour for Wired in August 2005. The band Zeromancer take their name from Neuromancer.|$|E
5|$|When he was three, {{he went to}} England {{with his}} mother and brother on what was {{intended}} to be a lengthy family visit. His father, however, died in South Africa of rheumatic fever before he could join them. This left the family without an income, so Tolkien's mother took him to live with her parents in Kings Heath, Birmingham. Soon after, in 1896, they moved to Sarehole (now in Hall Green), then a Worcestershire village, later annexed to Birmingham. He enjoyed exploring Sarehole Mill and Moseley Bog and the Clent, Lickey and Malvern Hills, which would later inspire scenes in his books, along with nearby towns and villages such as Bromsgrove, Alcester, and Alvechurch and places such as his aunt Jane's farm of Bag End, the name of which he used in <b>his</b> <b>fiction.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Aira {{has often}} spoken in {{interviews}} of elaborating an avant-garde aesthetic in which, rather than editing {{what he has}} written, he engages in a [...] "flight forward" [...] (fuga hacia adelante) to improvise {{a way out of}} the corners he writes himself into. Aira also seeks in his own work, and praises in the work of others (such as the Argentine-Parisian cartoonist and comic novelist Copi), the [...] "continuum" [...] (el continuo) of a constant momentum in the fictional narrative. As a result, <b>his</b> <b>fictions</b> can jump radically from one genre to another, and often deploy narrative strategies from popular culture and [...] "subliterary" [...] genres like pulp science fiction and television soap operas. He frequently refuses to conform to generic expectations for how a novel ought to end, leaving many of <b>his</b> <b>fictions</b> quite open-ended.|$|R

5|$|Howard Browne, who {{had been}} on a leave of absence from Ziff-Davis to write fiction, took over as editor and began by {{throwing}} away 300,000 words of inventory that Palmer had acquired before he left. Browne had ambitions of moving Amazing upmarket, and his argument was strengthened by Street & Smith, one of the longest established and most respected publishers, who shut down all of their pulp magazines in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, {{largely as a result of}} the success of pocketbooks, and Street & Smith decided to concentrate on their slick magazines. Some pulps struggled on for a few more years, but Browne was able to persuade Ziff and Davis that the future was in the slicks, and they raised <b>his</b> <b>fiction</b> budget from one cent to a ceiling of five cents per word. Browne managed to get promises of new stories from many well-known authors, including Isaac Asimov and Theodore Sturgeon. He produced a dummy issue in April 1950, and planned to launch the new incarnation of Amazing in April 1951, the 25th anniversary of the first issue. However, the economic impact of the Korean War, which broke out in June 1950, led to budget cuts. The plans were cancelled, and Ziff-Davis never revived the idea.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Walpole {{moved into}} a house near Keswick in the Lake District. His large income enabled him to {{maintain}} his London flat in Piccadilly, but Brackenburn, {{on the slopes of}} Catbells overlooking Derwentwater, was his main home {{for the rest of his}} life. He was quickly made welcome by local residents, and the scenery and atmosphere of the Lake District often found their way into <b>his</b> <b>fiction.</b> The critic James Agate commented that one might think from some of Walpole's stories that their author had created the English Lakes, but that he was probably only consulted about them. At the end of 1924 Walpole met Harold Cheevers, who soon became his friend and companion and remained so for the rest of Walpole's life. In Hart-Davis's words, he came nearer than any other human being to Walpole's long-sought conception of a perfect friend. Cheevers, a policeman, with a wife and two children, left the police force and entered Walpole's service as his chauffeur. Walpole trusted him completely, and gave him extensive control over his affairs. Whether Walpole was at Brackenburn or Piccadilly, Cheevers was almost always with him, and often accompanied him on overseas trips. Walpole provided a house in Hampstead for Cheevers and his family.|$|E
5|$|Setting out {{to write}} {{something}} on an epic scale, Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages {{in the very early}} stages of the series. His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time. In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later. However, with the Ice and Fire series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, he still has two more books to write as of 2016. Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write. As of 2011, Martin was still typing <b>his</b> <b>fiction</b> on a DOS computer with WordStar 4.0 software. He begins each day at 10am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work, and may write all day or struggle to write anything. Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time.|$|E

5|$|The {{works of}} American author Edgar Allan Poe (January 19, 1809– October 7, 1849) include many poems, short stories, and one novel. <b>His</b> <b>fiction</b> spans {{multiple}} genres, including horror fiction, adventure, science fiction, and detective fiction, a genre he {{is credited with}} inventing. These works are generally {{considered part of the}} Dark romanticism movement, a literary reaction to Transcendentalism. Poe's writing reflects his literary theories: he disagreed with didacticism and allegory. Meaning in literature, he said in his criticism, should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface; works whose meanings are too obvious cease to be art. Poe pursued originality in his works, and disliked proverbs. He often included elements of popular pseudosciences such as phrenology and physiognomy. His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, and mourning. Though known as a masterly practitioner of Gothic fiction, Poe did not invent the genre; he was following a long-standing popular tradition.|$|E
