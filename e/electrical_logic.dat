40|$|With the {{build-out}} {{of large}} transport networks utilizing optical technologies, {{more and more}} capacity is being made available. Innovations in Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) {{and the elimination of}} optical-electrical-optical conversions have brought on advances in communication speeds as we move into 10 Gigabit Ethernet and above. Of course, {{there is a need to}} encrypt data on these optical links as the data traverses public and private network backbones. Unfortunately, as the communications infrastructure becomes increasingly optical, advances in encryption (done electronically) have failed to keep up. This project examines the use of optical logic for implementing encryption in the photonic domain to achieve the requisite encryption rates. In order to realize photonic encryption designs, technology developed for <b>electrical</b> <b>logic</b> circuits must be translated to the photonic regime. This paper examines two classes of all optical logic (SEED, gain competition) and how each discrete logic element can be interconnected and cascaded to form an optical circuit. Because there is no known software that can model these devices at a circuit level, the functionality of the SEED and gain competition devices in an optical circuit were modeled in PSpice. PSpice allows modeling of the macro characteristics of the devices in context of a logic element as opposed to device level computational modeling. By representing light intensity as voltage, 'black box' models are generated that accurately represent the intensity response and logic levels in both technologies. By modeling the behavior at the systems level, one can incorporate systems design tools and a simulation environment to aid in the overall functional design. Each black box model of the SEED or gain competition device takes certain parameters (reflectance, intensity, input response), and models the optical ripple and time delay characteristics. These 'black box' models are interconnected and cascaded in an encrypting/scrambling algorithm based on a study of candidate encryption algorithms. We found that a low gate count, cascadable encryption algorithm is most feasible given device and processing constraints. The modeling and simulation of optical designs using these components is proceeding in parallel with efforts to perfect the physical devices and their interconnect. We have applied these techniques to the development of a 'toy' algorithm that may pave the way for more robust optical algorithms. These design/modeling/simulation techniques are now ready to be applied to larger optical designs in advance of our ability to implement such systems in hardware...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{advanced}} technology nodes, incremental delay due to coupling {{is a serious}} concern. Design companies spend significant resources on static timing analysis (STA) tool licenses with signal integrity (SI) enabled. The runtime of the STA tools in SI mode is typically large due to complex algorithms and iterative calculation of timing windows to accurately determine aggressor and victim alignments, as well as delay and slew estimations. In this work, we develop machine learning-based predictors of timing in SI mode based on timing reports from non-SI mode. Timing analysis in non-SI mode is faster and the license costs can be several times less than those of SI mode. We determine <b>electrical</b> and <b>logic</b> structure parameters that affect the incremental arc delay/slew and path delay (i. e., the difference in arrival times at the clock pin of the launch flip-flop and the D pin of the capture flip-flop) in SI mode, and develop models that can predict these SI-aware delays. We report worst-case error of 7. 0 ps and average error of 0. 7 ps for our models to predict incremental transition time, worst-case error of 5. 2 ps and average error of 1. 2 ps for our models to predict incremental delay, and worst-case error of 8. 2 ps and average error of 1. 7 ps for our models to predict path delay, in 28 nm FDSOI technology.
