50|$|A simple <b>diode</b> <b>clipper</b> can be {{made with}} a diode and a resistor. This will remove either the positive, or the {{negative}} half of the waveform depending on the direction the diode is connected. The simple circuit clips at zero voltage (or to be more precise, at the small forward voltage of the forward biased diode) but the clipping voltage can be set to any desired value {{with the addition of a}} reference voltage. The diagram illustrates a positive reference voltage but the reference can be positive or negative for both positive and negative clipping giving four possible configurations in all.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel method for {{the solution of}} guitar distortion circuits based {{on the use of}} kernels. The proposed algorithm uses a kernel regression framework to linearize the inherent nonlinear dynamical systems created by such circuits and proposes data and kernel selection algorithms well suited to learn the required regression parameters. Examples are presented using the One Capacitor <b>Diode</b> <b>Clipper</b> and the Common-Cathode Tube Amplifier...|$|E
40|$|This work extends {{previous}} research on numerical solution of nonlinear systems in musical acoustics {{to the realm of}} nonlinear musical circuits. Wave digital principles and nonlinear state-space simulators provide two alternative approaches explored in this work. These methods are used to simulate voltage amplification stages typically used in guitar distortion or amplifier circuits. Block level analysis of the entire circuit suggests a strategy based upon the nonlinear filter composition technique for connecting amplifier stages while accounting for the way these stages interact. Formulations are given for the bright switch, the <b>diode</b> <b>clipper,</b> a transistor amplifier, and a triode amplifier. 1...|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} paper we have formulated how experiments on Clippers are performed using {{the concept of}} virtual Intelligent SoftLab (VIS). A Combination Clipper circuit constructed using the Virtual SoftLab and observed actual outputs using VIS Model. Clipping circuits are used to remove {{the part of a}} signal that is above or below some defined reference level. VIS helps us to create results using visual display. Software for conducting the experimentations in Clipper has been developed which helps students to perform and practice the experiments. This paper explains the working of different <b>diode</b> <b>clipper</b> circuits like Positive and Negative Diode Clippers using Combinational Clipper Circuit with the help of VIS Model. A Clipper experiments provides a pictorial method of design and evaluating experiments. In this paper we have designed the software that can observe the results. This will help students in understanding working of combination Clipper. Such an implementation as regards other basic experiments is in progress...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores a {{computationally}} efficient, physically in-formed {{approach to}} design algorithms for emulating guitar distor-tion circuits. Two iconic effects pedals are studied: the “Distor-tion ” pedal and the “Tube Screamer ” or “Overdrive ” pedal. The primary distortion mechanism in both pedals is a <b>diode</b> <b>clipper</b> with an embedded low-pass filter, and {{is shown to}} follow a non-linear ordinary differential equation whose solution is computa-tionally expensive for real-time use. In the proposed method, a simplified model, comprising the cascade of a conditioning filter, memoryless nonlinearity and equalization filter, is chosen for its computationally efficient, numerically robust properties. Often, the design of distortion algorithms involves tuning the parameters of this filter-distortion-filter model by ear to match {{the sound of a}} prototype circuit. Here, the filter transfer functions and memo-ryless nonlinearities are derived by analysis of the prototype cir-cuit. Comparisons of the resulting algorithms to actual pedals show good agreement and demonstrate that the efficient algorithms presented reproduce the general character of the modeled pedals. 1...|$|E
40|$|The <b>diode</b> <b>clipper</b> circuit with an {{embedded}} {{low-pass filter}} {{lies at the}} heart of both diode clipping “Distortion ” and “Overdrive ” or “Tube Screamer ” effects pedals. An accurate simulation of this circuit requires the solution of a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE). Numerical methods with stiff stability – Backward Euler, Trapezoidal Rule, and second-order Backward Difference Formula – allow the use of relatively low sampling rates at the cost of accuracy and aliasing. However, these methods require iteration at each time step to solve a nonlinear equation, and the tradeoff for this complexity must be evaluated against simple explicit methods such as Forward Euler and fourth order Runge-Kutta, which require very high sampling rates for stability. This paper surveys and compares the basic ODE solvers as they apply to simulating circuits for audio processing. These methods are compared to a static nonlinearity with a pre-filter. It is found that implicit or semiimplicit solvers are preferred and that the filter/static nonlinearity approximation is often perceptually adequate. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} method that generates passive-guaranteed stable {{simulations}} of analog audio circuits from electronic schematics for real-time issues. On one hand, this method {{is based on a}} continuous-time power-balanced state-space representation structured into its energy-storing parts, dissipative parts, and external sources. On the other hand, a numerical scheme is especially designed to preserve this structure and the power balance. These state-space structures define the class of port-Hamiltonian systems. The derivation of this structured system associated with the electronic circuit is achieved by an automated analysis of the interconnection network combined with a dictionary of models for each elementary component. The numerical scheme is based on the combination of finite differences applied on the state (with respect to the time variable) and on the total energy (with respect to the state). This combination provides a discrete-time version of the power balance. This set of algorithms is valid for both the linear and nonlinear case. Finally, three applications of increasing complexities are given: a <b>diode</b> <b>clipper,</b> a common-emitter bipolar-junction transistor amplifier, and a wah pedal. The results are compared to offline simulations obtained from a popular circuit simulator...|$|E
