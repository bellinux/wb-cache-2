5|$|Highlights of the publication's {{first year}} have been {{published}} in book form as Halfwit Nation: Frontline Reporting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> on Stupid, both to acclaim and to complaints of unintelligent, overly crude humour.|$|E

5|$|With {{the growing}} dissatisfaction of the American {{electorate}} about Vietnam in 1969, high {{officials in the}} Nixon Administration sought a way to disengage the United States <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russo-Japanese War the Imperial Russian Navy was in a {{state of}} confusion. Its leadership, tactics and ship designs had all been cast into disrepute by its {{repeated}} defeats by the Japanese at the Battle of Tsushima, Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of the Yellow Sea. The Navy took quite some time to absorb the design lessons <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> while the government reformed the Naval Ministry and forced many of its more conservative officers to retire. It conducted a design contest for a dreadnought in 1906, but the Duma refused to authorize it, preferring to spend the money on rebuilding the Army.|$|E
5|$|Although the College {{building}} was saved <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> its walls and roof {{were left in}} a perilous state. In 1954 a decision was forced upon heralds, whether to abandon the old building (which would have been profitable financially) or repair it on a scale far beyond the College's resources. Eventually {{with the help of}} the Ministry of Works and a public subscription, the {{building was}} repaired in time for the College's 4th centenary of being in possession of Derby Place. The present gates to the building were added in 1956, and came originally from Goodrich Court in Herefordshire. The new gates displayed the College's arms and crest.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 600 Jews {{were killed}} in Greater Albania during the war. Albania-proper emerged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> with a {{population}} of Jews eleven times greater than at the beginning, numbering around 1,800 individuals. Most of these subsequently emigrated to Israel, but several hundred remained until the fall of Communism in the early 1990s before they did the same. As of 2011, 69 Albanians have been recognized as Righteous Among the Nations for the role they played in saving Jews during the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{destruction}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> the new ports of Fulton and Rockport were developed in the later 1860s. At first, Rockport was intended as a deep-water port, but after a series of mishaps, Aransas Pass was selected when deepening was approved in 1879. By 1912, a 100 feet wide and 8½ feet deep channel was operational. After hurricanes ransacked the port in 1916 and 1919, the United States Army Corps of Engineers chose Corpus Christi as the preferred deepwater port for the lower Gulf coast.|$|E
5|$|As the war neared its end, {{enrollment}} increased, {{until it}} reached 2,000 students in 1946. Nearly {{half of these}} students were veterans <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> and they received a monthly stipend to assist with housing and tuition costs. Sports and activities resumed to their prior levels {{and by the end}} of the 1940s, the faculty had expanded to 230 personnel and 40 part-time staff.|$|E

5|$|At that time, {{the only}} Finnish heavy vehicle {{producer}} Oy Suomen Autoteollisuus Ab (SAT) {{was building a}} new factory in Karis, a location considered less likely than Helsinki to come under attack from Soviet air raids. Company general director Tor Nessling suggested the factory should be larger than originally planned. As another option, Nessling, with extreme reservation, considered building a new factory elsewhere in Finland. SAT was experienced in heavy vehicle production but economic and technical resources were limited. Heavy vehicle importers and some political cliques thought SAT was trying to benefit <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> and to gain a dominant position in the Finnish market.|$|E
5|$|Born in Litchfield County, Connecticut, James Morris {{spent his}} early life hoping and {{training}} to be a minister. However, after graduating from Yale College, Morris accepted a commission of First Lieutenant from the Continental Army and joined the fight for American Independence. Morris was captured during the Battle of Germantown {{and spent most of}} the remaining war in captivity. Upon his release, Morris was promoted to the rank of Captain and supported Alexander Hamilton in the Siege of Yorktown. When he returned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> Morris began and ran an academy that trained both boys and girls together, a rarity at the time.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{survived the}} war, though Leipzig was in very poor {{condition}} following an accidental collision {{with the heavy}} cruiser Prinz Eugen late in the war. Leipzig was therefore used as a barracks ship before being scuttled in 1946. Nürnberg, however, emerged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> largely unscathed, and as a result, was seized by the Soviet Navy as war reparations, and commissioned into the Soviet fleet as Admiral Makarov; she continued in Soviet service until the late 1950s, and was broken up for scrap by 1960.|$|E

5|$|Combined Operations Headquarters {{worked closely}} with several {{intelligence}} organisations to plan the raid. The Naval Intelligence Division compiled information {{from a variety of}} sources. A detailed plan of the town of St Nazaire was provided by the Secret Intelligence Service, and information on the coastal artillery nearby was sourced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> Office's Military Intelligence branch. Intelligence about the dock itself came from pre-war technical journals.|$|E
5|$|Coward's most {{enduring}} work <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> years was the hugely successful black comedy Blithe Spirit (1941), about a novelist who researches the occult and hires a medium. A séance brings back {{the ghost of}} his first wife, causing havoc for the novelist and his second wife. With 1,997 consecutive performances, it broke box-office records for the run of a West End comedy, and was also produced on Broadway, where its original run was 650 performances. The play was adapted into a 1945 film, directed by Lean. Coward toured during 1942 in Blithe Spirit, alternating the piece with his comedy Present Laughter and his working-class drama This Happy Breed.|$|E
5|$|Despite being outnumbered {{and poorly}} equipped, certain Bulgarian units offered fierce resistance, delaying the Entente advance in Zborsko. However, the {{collapse}} of the front line enabled the Allies to assault Bulgarian positions from multiple directions and eventually quell the last pockets of resistance. The Central Powers' defeat at the Dobro Pole {{played a role in the}} Bulgarian withdrawal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> and opened the way for the subsequent capture of Vardar Macedonia.|$|E

5|$|François Coli, age 45, a World War I {{veteran and}} {{recipient}} of the French Legion of Honor, had been making record-breaking flights across and around the Mediterranean Sea, and had been planning a transatlantic flight since 1923. His original plans were to fly with his wartime comrade Paul Tarascon, a flying ace with 12 victories <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> They {{became interested in the}} Orteig Prize in 1925, but in late 1926 an accident destroyed their Potez 25 biplane. Tarascon was badly burned, and relinquished his place as pilot to 35-year-old Charles Nungesser, a highly experienced flying ace with over 40 victories, third highest among the French.|$|E
5|$|From {{the turn}} of the 20th century {{to the start of the}} Second World War, there were few changes in Altrincham. Although the town was witness to some of the Luftwaffe's raids on the Manchester area, it emerged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> {{relatively}} unscathed, and as with the rest of Britain, experienced an economic boom. This manifested itself in the construction of new housing and the 1960s rebuilding of the town centre. However, during the 1970s employment at Broadheath declined by nearly 40per cent.|$|E
5|$|Hawes {{remained}} at Nelly's Ford until May 1865. Finally satisfied {{that it was}} safe to return to Kentucky, Hawes arrived in Paris to find his home had been burned by Union troops. Four of Hawes's sons served in the Confederate Army, including brigadier general James Morrison Hawes; only three sons returned home <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> On September 18, 1865, Hawes took an oath of allegiance to the United States, and was allowed to return to his previous career as a lawyer.|$|E
