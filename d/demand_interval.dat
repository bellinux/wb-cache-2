We replicate this pull-to-center effect in laboratory experiments and construct an adaptive learning model that incorporates memory, reinforcement, and probabilistic choice to explain individual decisions. The intuition underlying the model's prediction is that the most recent demand observation is {{more likely to have been}} greater than the optimal order quantity if the optimal order quantity is low, in which case a recency bias tends to pull the order quantity upward. A countervailing downward pull exists if the optimal order quantity is high. The recency effect may be augmented by a reinforcement bias, which causes subjects to focus more on the profitability of decisions they actually make and less on counterfactual payoffs that would have resulted from other order quantities. The predictions of this model track the observed data patterns across treatments. A pull-to-center pattern is also observed in designs involving doubled payoffs and reduced order frequency. newsvendor problem, dynamic learning...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} method to forecast intermittent demand {{is that by}} Croston. This method is available in ERP type solutions such as SAP and specialised forecasting software packages (e. g. Forecast Pro), and often applied in practice. It uses exponential smoothing to separately update the estimated demand size and <b>demand</b> <b>interval</b> whenever a positive demand occurs, and their ratio provides the forecast of demand per period. The Croston method has two important disadvantages. First and foremost, not updating after (many) periods with zero demand renders the method unsuitable for dealing with obsolescence issues. Second, the method is positively biased and {{this is true for}} all points in time (i. e. considering the forecasts made at an arbitrary time period) and issue points only (i. e. considering the forecasts following a positive demand occurrence only). The second issue has been addressed in the literature by the proposal of an estimator (Syntetos–Boylan Approximation, SBA) that is approximately unbiased. In this paper, we propose a new method that overcomes both these shortcomings while not adding complexity. Different from the Croston method, the new method is unbiased (for all points in time) and it updates the demand probability instead of the <b>demand</b> <b>interval,</b> doing so in every period. The comparative merits of the new estimator are assessed by means of an extensive simulation experiment.

Two fuzzy goals are {{considered in the}} model; profit goal and change of workforce level goal. In conventional aggregate production planning (APP) models, logistics planning is not included. Even it is a critical criterion that creates extra cost. Moreover, demand is considered as crisp demand, which is not realistic.

So, APP with <b>interval</b> <b>demand</b> that the best solution of possible demand can be selected is proposed in this research. Uncertain capacity is also considered in the proposed model.

40|$|Due to {{the recent}} inflow of Electric Vehicles (EVs) to the {{automobile}} market, new concerns have risen {{with respect to the}} additional electrical load and the resultant effects on an overloaded electric grid. Either for convenience purposes or possibly necessity due to limited electric range on EVs, some EV owners may desire to charge their EV while at work in addition to charging at home. These forward-thinking daytime charging providers are typically Commercial and Industrial (C 2 ̆ 6 I) electric ratepayers, or other large electric consumers which constitute the majority of businesses, shopping centers, academic campuses and manufacturing facilities. Increased electricity consumption due to EV charging activity results in higher electricity costs due to differences in the billing structures between residential and C 2 ̆ 6 I electric ratepayers. Therefore, it is beneficial to the EVSE charging provider to minimize charging activity around peak demand periods which would result in lower electrical costs overall. A solution is developed that can provide this control without creating a nuisance to electric vehicle owners since EV charging demand is somewhat inelastic due to range anxiety. The primary objective of the research detailed in this dissertation is to develop a novel demand side management system for monitoring the peak demand of commercial time-of-day electric ratepayers that cost effectively predicts and controls electric vehicle charging during peak demand periods. This objective is achieved, therefore confirming the hypothesis that such a system can provide cost and demand benefits to forward-thinking commercial electric ratepayers that provide daytime charging capabilities. This work proposes and evaluates a novel Power Monitoring and Control System (PMCS) that can be implemented at C 2 ̆ 6 I EV charging locations to minimize or eliminate the negative impacts of charging electric vehicles at the workplace in C 2 ̆ 6 I environments. Operation of the PMCS begins by forecasting electrical demand in advance of every 15 minute <b>demand</b> <b>interval</b> throughout the day. The forecast is generated using an artificial neural network and a number of input data streams. Electrical demand has been shown to correlate well with weather data such as temperature and dew point. Therefore, using those measurements along with a date and time stamp, and historical electrical demand measurements, a highly accurate forecast for the following 15 -minute <b>demand</b> <b>interval</b> was achieved. From that forecast, the number of EV charging stations that may be active, without the chance of creating new electrical demand peaks, is calculated. Finally, the forecast is then used to properly schedule EV charging activity so that electrical demand peaks can be avoided but charging activity is maximized. The avoidance of charging activity at or near peaks in electrical demand results in lower total electric costs associated with the charging process. The final design was implemented in an EV charging testbed at the University of Louisville and data was collected to verify the operation and performance of the PMCS. With a properly designed scheduling and prioritization control algorithm, increases in electrical demand and associated costs are limited to the error in the forecasting algorithm used for predicting electrical demand levels. The final design of the forecasting algorithm results in a mean absolute percent error of 0. 02...|$|E
40|$|Part demand {{forecasting}} methods {{assume that}} the demand for a part over time follows a predictable pattern, and that the patterns observed in historical data provide a reliable indication of future demands. Generally, forecasting studies focus on topics such as: the span of time from which to sample the historical data, an assessment of data {{in order to find}} weekly or annual patterns, and the assignment of probabilities of different demand quantities in any given time period. Using the demand models derived from these forecasting methods, inventory decisions are made [...] decisions which directly impact operating cost and equipment availability. Like most general part demand forecasting methods, aircraft spare part demand forecasting considers historical trends in order to predict future demand. It is a well-known practical observation that aircraft spare part demands are often very erratic (quantity variability), intermittent (variable in timing), and otherwise unpredictable. However, contemporary science does not explain the causes of these variations, and suffers from very poor forecasting accuracy. The objective of this research is to study the likely causes of the variations in demand quantity and from that understanding to develop forecasting methods which are more appropriate for the wearout characteristics and high reliability of many aircraft parts. As a first look at the problem, models of part failure are developed. These models are used to simulate multiple simultaneous parts operating identically. The simulations found that aircraft spare parts demands tend to be lumpy, and that this lumpiness tends to consist of two parts: a random element (called noise), and a cyclic element (called signal). These simulation results are compared to existing aircraft spare parts demand data, and similar lumpy characteristics are identified. The research then more deeply understands these elements of spare part demand lumpiness by developing equations explaining this lumpiness. These equations find that the same factors (quantity of parts operating simultaneously and reliability of those parts) both impact the average <b>demand</b> <b>interval</b> and the demand coefficients of variance, and that they impact these demand characteristics so similarly that demand lumpiness should be expected. Having determined that lumpiness is to be expected, the research proceeds to find forecasting methods that best account for this lumpiness. It is theorized that no one forecasting method would best account for signal lumpiness, noise lumpiness, and smooth demands; thus, the study develops a heuristic to select the best forecasting method based upon key part characteristics (reliability and quantity). The forecasting heuristic development uses Monte Carlo simulations to find ranges of part characteristics for which certain forecasting methods and parameters are most likely to provide the lowest error forecasts. Developing this forecasting method selection heuristic uncovers additional new and unique information, as follows: - The best error in many cases is 100 % error, showing the need to move beyond forecasting for inventory management of many parts. - The forecasting error computation method used by the forecasting professional strongly influences the selection of the best forecasting method. - Certain elementary forecasting methods (e. g. naive or always zero) produce lower errors than any complex methods in some aircraft parts management conditions. - The selection of forecasting method parameters {{is as important as the}} selection of forecasting methods. This dissertation makes an important and unique contribution to the science of aircraft spare parts forecasting in creating a method to develop heuristics to select the lowest error forecasting methods. However, this dissertation makes a simultaneously important contribution in developing the inherent limits of forecasting [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{are able}} to emit {{flavours}} over their flowers, leaves and fruits. These flavours serve them as attractants, repellents or signal molecules. Many plants show a constitutive emission {{of a series of}} different mono- and sesquiterpenes. Futhermore plants have also inducible emissions. The influence of stressors like e. g. predators, bacteria, fungi or ozone yield to novel synthesis and emission of repellents and signal molecules. They originate mainly form octadecanoid and sikimate pathway. The octadecanoid pathway yields in the formation of alcohols and aldehyds (predominatly C 6 -compounds). Starting form free fatty acids they were generated and emitted via an enzyme cascade (lipase, lipoxygenase, hydroperoxidelyase). The Shikimat pathway is important for the formation of the important plant hormone salicylic acid (SA). After methylation SA can be emitted as the volatile methylsalicylate MeSA) into the atmosphere. The main task of the work was to approve if it is possible to draw conclusions from stress induced emissions to certain plant internal enzyme activities or substrate concentration in the model plant tomato (cv. Moneymaker). The would allow a non invasive measurement of such endogenous parameters. On the one hand it should be proved if the emission of green leave aldehyds and alcohols (GLAs) can be suitable for the prediction of the enzyme activities lipase, lipoxygenase and hydroperoxidelyase or the substrate concentrations in the octadecanoid pathway. The GLAs were measured by online GC/MS, the intermediates (free fatty acids, hydroperoxy fatty acids) by HPLC and the enzyme activities by UV/VIS spectroscopy. A good correlation between a certain enzyme activity/substrate concentration should then be a hint to the rate-determining step in the cascade. On the other hand it should be proved if emission of MeSA can be suitable for the prediction of endogenous free SA concentration. Also in this case I looked for a correlation between the MeSA emission and the plant internal SA concentration. The measurement of MeSA were measured by online GC/MS as well and the endogenous SA concentrations by HPLC. Ozone exposure and infection by fungi (Botrytis cinerea) were used as abiotic/biotic stressors respectively. The stress response on ozone exposure of the tomato plants started with varying lag times between 1 and 3 hours. The plants reacted with the emission of methanol, GLAs and MeSA as well as increasing of the emissions of mono- and sesquiterpenes. The plants were removed from the chamber, snap frozen and homogenised with pistil and mortar and stored at - 80 °C until the extraction and measurement of the enzyme activities/SA concentrations respectively. Whereas the GLA emissions showed no good correlations with lipase and hydroperoxidelyase activities (0. 19 and 0. 41) the correlation with the lipoxygenase activity was quite good (0. 82). This points to the lipoxygenase to be the rate-determining step for the GLA emission. Free fatty acids were found in similar concentrations both in control plants and stressed plants. Substrate limitation by low availability of free fatty acids hence seems not to be ratedetermining. The concentration of hydroperoxy fatty acids were always beyond the detection limit, therefore the lack of substrate for the hydroperoxidelyase may be the "bottle neck" for the GLA emission strength. Also this substrate limitation should lead to a good correlation between GLA emission and lipoxygenase activity. Due to this good correlation it is in cases of Botrytis infection and ozone fluxes between 3 • 10 - 8 and 8 • 10 - 8 mol m- 2 s- 1 possible to predict internal enzyme activities by measurement of the GLA emissions. However the GLA emission are not in all cases sufficient to predict the lipoxygenase activity without restrictions. In particular high ozone fluxes into the plant yielded in very high GLA emissions and strong variances form the linear correlation between emission and lipoxygenase activity occurred. Also the emission of MeSA and the internal concentration of free SA showed a good correlation (0. 91). Though it should possible to estimate the endogenous free SA concentration by measuring the MeSA emission. All in all this work shows {{that it is possible to}} conclude different plant internal enzyme activities and amounts of substances using the measurement of volatile compounds.

The consciousness of this dilemma renewed his extreme embarrassment of look, voice, and manner; he hesitated, looked down, and on the Queen repeating her question with a stern voice and flashing eye, he admitted with faltering words, [...] "That it might be--he could not positively--that is, in certain events--explain the reasons and grounds on which he acted." ...|$|R

The interval stochastic stability criteria of the provided model are investigated by the theory of economics, interval dynamical system, and the theory stability of stochastic differential equations. The conclusions indicate that the <b>demand</b> elasticity stable <b>interval</b> can be calculated and the random excitation intensity does not impact the system stability. Some numerical examples are given to show the applicability and validity of the obtained results from a statistical perspective...|$|R
