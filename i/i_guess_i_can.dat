2500|$|At {{the time}} of his {{retirement}} in November 1906, Wedge was the lightweight champion of Arkansas. Wedge, who was scheduled to fight Guy Buckles in front of 2,000 fans over six rounds on a sand bar south of Omaha, Nebraska, announced his retirement before the bout to devote his life to Christian service and then gave Buckles a religious tract and a New Testament. Buckles, who was insulted by Wedge's actions, punched Wedge on the nose, however Wedge refused to retaliate, choosing instead to [...] "turn the other cheek". However, after another blow from Buckles, Wedge indicated: [...] "I have not been told what to do next, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> pound you to pulp without interfering with my conscience". In the ensuing altercation, both fighters were severely disfigured, but Wedge was adjudged the winner. Wedge indicated that he would pray for Buckles.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{understand}} not this, reverend sir," [...] {{said the}} Lady; [...] "nor do <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> what <b>I</b> <b>can</b> have now said or done, {{to draw down}} on me an admonition which has something a taste of reproof." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Never {{mind what}} I make him out. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{understand}} him you can accept him. And I {{appeal to you}} solemnly. You can save me or you can lose me. If you lose me you’ll be a coward. And if you say a word against me I’ll be lost.” ...|$|R

Where I shall be living this day month <b>I</b> cannot <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only say one thing certainly, and that is that I shall not come back here. There never was a fellow so loose about the world as I am." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> am able, {{although}} my head aches a good bit, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell you that. I am much obliged {{for what you}} have done for me." ...|$|R
