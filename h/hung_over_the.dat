25|$|After Chase's {{death in}} 1873, the Supreme Court {{established}} {{a tradition that}} a newly deceased Justice's chair and {{the front of the}} bench where the Justice sat will be draped with black wool crêpe, with black crêpe <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Court's entrance.|$|E

25|$|The tournament {{had been}} preceded by doubts and pessimism; many feared {{that it would}} produce one-sided-matches that would be unattractive to supporters. The {{forthcoming}} Super League war also <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> tournament, with the Australian Rugby League refusing to select players who had signed for the rival competition.|$|E
25|$|The TVUUC Board {{voted to}} rename the 'greeting hall' to honor Greg McKendry, citing his {{outgoing}} and friendly personality, and to rename the church library to honor Linda Kraeger, citing {{her work as}} an author and professor. An oil painting of Greg McKendry was <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> fireplace in the greeting hall.|$|E
25|$|Both the Stars and Giants filed protests over games 7 and 8. Giants player Turkey Stearnes hit an umpire and {{controversy}} <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> series. The Stars claimed the Giants had used ineligible players. The Giants protested that two games {{should not have}} been played at night. Nevertheless, the Stars championship was upheld by the league.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time the {{constant}} threat of Scottish and Spanish conflict, culminating in the Spanish Armada of 1588, <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> iron trade and gave it resilience: one could not have enough cannons. That fact, combined with the new age of exploration and the rise of England's naval power, meant that there was an almost unlimited demand for the new armaments.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{fire damage}} to {{infrastructure}} and extreme winds bringing down powerlines across the area, {{large parts of}} the city lost power. Fires also started in Giralang because of powerline problems. Evacuation centres were set up at four schools – Canberra College, Ginninderra College, Erindale College, and Narrabundah College. A dark cloud <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> city, and, although it was not in danger, Parliament House was closed.|$|E
25|$|The {{area and}} traffic {{generated}} by transshipment was so extensive {{that a new}} station building was needed. Balthazar Conrad Lange had become NSB's head architect, and was issued the task of designing a new main station building. The second station building was located east of the old, at roughly {{the location of the}} current bus station. Also built in wood, it received a roof which <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> platform. The old station building was converted to railway offices. The track out of the station was moved further away from the lakeshore. The new station was taken into use in 1880.|$|E

25|$|In 1997 the Reds {{became one}} of eight ARL teams to join the rival Super League during the dispute known as the Super League war. They changed their name to the Perth City Reds for the 1997 Super League season, and adopted a jersey of red, white and black. Although the club had made some {{promising}} signings, such as Rodney Howe and Robbie Kearns, the crushing $10 million debt that <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> club (from having to pay the airfares for all visiting teams) {{at the end of}} the season led to Super League axing the Perth Reds on 1 October 1997.|$|E
25|$|In 1557 or 1558, he {{resigned}} as headmaster of the school, and left Utrecht {{to return to}} his native soil, Brabant. Here he lived for another year in the House of Brothers of the Common Life in 's-Hertogenbosch. He {{died at the age of}} 71 in this town during a period of the plague, in July 1558, and was buried in the Brothers’ church. After his death, his grateful former students erected a monumental tomb there, with an epitaph. They had a portrait painted of their beloved master, which was <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> tomb. Both tomb and painting have since disappeared and so has the church.|$|E

A Swordfish crashed into the sea following a rocket assisted take off {{with the loss of}} the two man crew. Another Swordfish crashed on landing with the aircraft initially <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ship's side from its tail hook. When the hook gave way it crashed into the sea and only the pilot was rescued. The squadron in total lost or so severely damaged eight Swordfish and two Wildcats that they could not fly again.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the stadium}} was {{originally}} {{built for the}} Giants, the stadium's lower walls were blue and the seats and the stadium's four gates were red and blue to reflect the team colors. When the Jets moved in, green banners were <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> walls and eventually over the outer gates of the stadium anytime the team hosted a game. In addition, team-specific end zone decorations would be changed for Jets home games. This was accomplished by either painting over the Giants logos, or replacing the turf section of each end zone. Midfield decorations at the 50-yard line were typically not team-specific (in early years a Meadowlands logo, and later an NFL shield), {{which could be used}} for both teams' games.|$|E
25|$|In South Indian temples, often each {{god will}} have His or Her own shrine, each {{contained}} in a miniature house (specifically, a mandir). These shrines are often scattered around the temple compound, with the three main ones being in the main area. The statue of the God (murti) is placed on a stone pedestal in the shrine, and one or more lamps are hung in the shrine. There is usually a space to put the puja tray (tray with worship offerings). Directly outside the main shrine {{there will be a}} statue of the god's vahana or vehicle. The shrines have curtains <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> entrances, and wooden doors which are shut when the Deities are sleeping. Some South Indian temples have one main altar, with several statues placed upon it.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, the ex-Cambrian {{network of}} Western Region was {{transferred}} to the London Midland Region. A question mark <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> VoR's future for some time, until the Minister for Transport, Barbara Castle, confirmed that it would remain open and in British Rail's hands. In 1968, the line was rerouted in Aberystwyth to run into the former standard gauge Carmarthen line platforms of the main station, which had been abandoned in 1964. This meant that the route of the line no longer dog-legged and did not have to cross Park Avenue by a level crossing. The former standard gauge locomotive shed was also refurbished and adapted into use for the VoR. The former station site is now occupied by a supermarket and the former route was sold for redevelopment.|$|E

25|$|Eight {{years after}} Giants Stadium opened, it gained a second major tenant. The Jets' lease at Shea Stadium, {{the home of}} the New York Mets, had expired {{at the end of the}} 1983 season and team owner Leon Hess was having trouble {{negotiating}} terms of a new lease to stay in Queens. The city of New York was unwilling to agree to his terms and Hess decided to move the Jets to the Meadowlands permanently (the team previously played a regular season game there in 1977). Their first game in Giants Stadium was on September 6, 1984. With the Jets now playing at the stadium, the grounds crew needed to find a way to set their games apart from Giants games and make them more inviting for their fans and eventually came up with a series of green and white banners and coverings that were <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> field-level blue walls that circled the stadium and (later) the four entrance gates outside the stadium.|$|E

Soane acquired three works by his friend J. M. W. Turner: St Hugues Denouncing Vegeance on the Shepherd of Cormayer Val D'Aoust (an oil painting), Kirkstall Abbey (watercolour) & Admiral Van Tromp's Barge entering the Texel (an oil painting). Thomas Lawrence painted a three quarter length portrait of Soane, it is <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Dining Room fireplace in the museum. Soane also has a painting by Antoine Watteau, a fête champêtre. Soane owned one oil painting by Joshua Reynolds's Love and Beauty, this hangs in the dining room over the sideboard. Soane commissioned an oil painting from Augustus Wall Callcott c.1830, entitled The Passage Point -Italian Composition.|$|E
