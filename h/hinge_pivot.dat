The symmetric design of the linkage and its long travel relative to other MEMS suspensions has the potential to provide a number of advantages, such as the reduction of quadrature error.

50|$|Knife {{switches}} {{consist of}} a flat metal blade, hinged at one end, with an insulating handle for operation, and a fixed contact. When the switch is closed, current flows through the <b>hinged</b> <b>pivot</b> and blade and through the fixed contact. Such switches are usually not enclosed. The knife and contacts are typically formed of copper, steel, or brass, depending on the application. Fixed contacts may be backed up with a spring. Several parallel blades can be operated {{at the same time}} by one handle. The parts may be mounted on an insulating base with terminals for wiring, or may be directly bolted to an insulated switch board in a large assembly. Since the electrical contacts are exposed, the switch is used only where people cannot accidentally come in contact with the switch or where the voltage is so low as to not present a hazard.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} resolve the {{disadvantages}} of conventional crutch designs (i. e. underarm and forearm), a novel crutch design is presented {{with the name of}} 21 st Century Crutch. Prior the design, human natural treadmill walking is monitored by a 3 D Motion Capture System and acquired a reference end–foot trajectory with a ‘teardrop shape’. Considering the design objectives, natural human walking and comfort, and other factors such as load capacity and weight of the device, the final design was determined. In order to satisfy the design objectives, a kinematic synthesis previously worked by Robson and McCarthy [14] is applied to test if the end–foot trajectory of designed crutch smoothly follows the desired reference, ‘teardrop shape’ in the vicinity of two specified task points, heel strike and toe off. For that reason the leg was synthesized and animated in Mathematica as a RR planar kinematic chain, where the first <b>hinge</b> joint/fixed <b>pivot</b> was located at the hip and the other <b>hinge</b> joint/moving <b>pivot</b> is at the knee joint. A prototype of the final design was fabricated and its performance was tested by 2 mph treadmill walking...|$|R
50|$|Care must {{be taken}} if the {{molecule}} possesses globally defined dynamics, such as about a <b>hinge</b> or <b>pivot,</b> because these motions will obscure the local motions which the Lindemann index is designed to quantify. An appropriate tactic in this circumstance is to sum the rij only over {{a small number of}} neighbouring atoms to arrive at each qi. A further variety of such modifications to the Lindemann index are available and have different merits, e.g. for the study of glassy vs crystalline materials.|$|R
25|$|A lever is a beam {{connected}} to ground by a <b>hinge,</b> or <b>pivot,</b> called a fulcrum. The ideal lever does not dissipate or store energy, which {{means there is}} no friction in the hinge or bending in the beam. In this case, the power into the lever equals the power out, and the ratio of output to input force is given by {{the ratio of the}} distances from the fulcrum to the points of application of these forces. This is known as the law of the lever.|$|R

40|$|Nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs) {{catalyze}} {{the conversion}} of l-arginine to nitric oxide and citrulline. There are three NOS isozymes, each with a different physiological role: neuronal NOS, endothelial NOS, and inducible NOS (iNOS). NOSs consist of an N-terminal oxygenase domain and a C-terminal reductase domain, linked by a calmodulin (CaM) -binding region. CaM is required for NO production, but unlike other NOS isozymes, iNOS binds CaM independently of the exogenous Ca 2 + concentration. We have co-expressed CaM and the FMN domain of human iNOS, which includes the CaM-binding region. The Ca 2 +-bound protein complex (CaCaM·FMN) forms an air-stable semiquinone when reduced with NADPH and reduces cytochrome c when reconstituted with the iNOS FAD/NADPH domain. We have solved the crystal structure of the CaCaM·FMN complex in four different conformations, each with a different relative orientation, between the FMN domain and the bound CaM. The CaM-binding region together with bound CaM forms a <b>hinge,</b> <b>pivots</b> on the conserved Arg 536, and regulates electron transfer from FAD to FMN and from FMN to heme by adjusting the relative orientation and distance among the three cofactors. In addition, the relative orientations of the N- and C-terminal lobes of CaM are also different among the four conformations, suggesting that the flexibility between {{the two halves of}} CaM also contributes to the fine tuning of the orientation/distance between the redox centers. The data demonstrate a possible mode for precise control of electron transfer by altering the distance and orientation of redox centers in a protein displaying domain movement...|$|R
40|$|The {{origins of}} {{mountain}} snowshoes {{can be traced}} back to the 1940 s and 1950 s, when small, maneuverable wooden frames were developed in the Adirondacks and Green Mountains. Fixed traction devices and forward hinge points originated in the Cascades in the late 1950 s, enabling better access to steep terrain. The 1960 s brought strong, lightweight aluminum-framed snowshoes from the Sierra Nevada. During this time, neoprene-coated nylon began to replace rawhide lacing and bindings in the Adirondacks, while neoprene-coated nylon decking was first used in the Cascades. Integrated plastic frame/decking snowshoes were a 1960 s Rockies weight- and labor-saving innovation. From the Cascades in the early 1970 s came <b>hinged</b> <b>pivot</b> bindings, with attached claws, that provided better traction and tracking. Integrated aluminum frame/decking snowshoes came from the Sierra Nevada in the 1980 s. Fixed-pivot bindings and rear traction cleats for added maneuverability and stability originated in the Rockies and Sierra Nevada in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. More substantial and user-friendly bindings also developed in the Green Mountains during this time. Further refined, integrated plastic frame/decking snowshoes from the Rockies came along in the 1990 s. In the last decade, innovations from the Cascades and Rockies included integrated aluminum frame/traction snowshoes that further enhanced stability on steep slopes. Seventy years of research and development across North America has resulted in smaller, lighter, stronger, and more maneuverable mountain snowshoes. These innovations, and aggressive marketing initiated in the late 1980 s, have helped snowshoeing become the fastest-growing winter sport in the U. S., with approximately five million participants...|$|R

In early castles the bridge might be {{designed}} to be destroyed or removed {{in the event of}} an attack, but drawbridges became very common. A typical arrangement would have the drawbridge immediately outside a gatehouse, consisting of a wooden deck with one edge <b>hinged</b> or <b>pivoting</b> at the gatehouse threshold, so that in the raised position the bridge would be flush against the gate, forming an additional barrier to entry. It would be backed by one or more portcullises and gates. Access to the bridge could be resisted with missiles from machicolations above or arrow slits in flanking towers.|$|R

The task of converting the aircraft to a bomber was formidable and included redesigning the center fuselage to accommodate the gunner/navigator immediately aft of the pilot and provision of two [...] ShKAS machine guns, one for the gunner and the other fixed in the nose.

5000|$|The {{construction}} of the header and its connections to the steam pipe and steam chest were such that steam had {{to pass through the}} elements on its way from the boiler to the cylinders. The flow of heat through the large superheater flue tubes was controlled by damper doors (marked [...] "D" [...] in the diagram), <b>hinged</b> or <b>pivoted</b> below the header in the smokebox. The damper doors were actuated by a small automatic steam cylinder and piston attached to the outer shell of the smokebox. While the regulator was shut, the dampers were kept closed by a counterweight fitted to a crank. When steam was admitted, the dampers were immediately opened simultaneously. The dampers could also be manually operated from the footplate, independently of the automatic cylinder.|$|R
