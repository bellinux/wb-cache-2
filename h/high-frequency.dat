5|$|Synthetic diamond has {{potential}} uses as a semiconductor, {{because it can}} be doped with impurities like boron and phosphorus. Since these elements contain one more or one less valence electron than carbon, they turn synthetic diamond into p-type or n-type semiconductor. Making a p–n junction by sequential doping of synthetic diamond with boron and phosphorus produces light-emitting diodes (LEDs) producing UV light of 235nm. Another useful property of synthetic diamond for electronics is high carrier mobility, which reaches 4500cm2/(V·s) for electrons in single-crystal CVD diamond. High mobility is favourable for <b>high-frequency</b> operation and field-effect transistors made from diamond have already demonstrated promising <b>high-frequency</b> performance above 50GHz. The wide band gap of diamond (5.5 eV) gives it excellent dielectric properties. Combined with the high mechanical stability of diamond, those properties are being used in prototype high-power switches for power stations.|$|E
5|$|Communication using surface-borne {{vibrational}} signals is {{more widespread}} among insects because of size constraints in producing air-borne sounds.

The mechanisms of production of vibrational signals are just as diverse as those for producing sound in insects.|$|E

40|$|Current {{disruption}} (CD) and {{the related}} kinetic instabilities in the near-Earth magnetosphere represent physical mechanisms which can trigger multi-scale substorm activity including global reorganizations of the magnetosphere. Lui et al. (2008) proposed a CD scenario in which the kinetic scale linear modes grow and reach the typical dipolarization scales through an inverse cascade. The experimental verification of the inverse nonlinear cascade is based on wavelet analysis. In this paper the Hilbert-Huang transform is used which is suitable for nonlinear systems and allows to reconstruct the time-frequency representation of empirical decomposed modes in an adaptive manner. It was found that, in the Lui et al. (2008) event, the modes evolve globally from <b>high-frequencies</b> to low-frequencies. However, there are also local frequency evolution trends oriented towards <b>high-frequencies,</b> indicating that the underlying processes involve multi-scale physics and non-stationary fluctuations for which the simple inverse cascade scenario is not correct.

30|$|Since {{the pitch}} delay varies from 20 to 147 samples, direct {{embedding}} of the pitch {{delay in the}} cover speech spectrum will affect the <b>high-frequencies</b> small-amplitudes cover spectrum components. Hence, the need to normalize the pitch delay is by 147, the maximum pitch delay, before the hiding process. The normalized pitch delay will have a value ranging from 0 to 1. For this reason, the best location to hide these parameters is the last cover speech spectrum location since the amplitude of this last component is very small.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Autonomic {{nervous system}} (ANS) {{activity}} {{is fundamental to}} infant health. ANS activity of preterm newborns seems to be reduced at term equivalent age, but follow-up of ANS activity has rarely been performed in that population during the weeks after birth. The aim {{of the study was}} to perform such a follow-up in preterm newborns of different gestational ages, up to their term equivalent ages. METHODS: Prolonged electrocardiographic recordings were prospectively performed in a group of 39 premature newborns, each week, up to term equivalent age before discharge. Control values were obtained from a group of 19 full-term newborns, recorded at the first week of their life. ANS indices were calculated from recordings during quiet sleep periods by spectral-domain analysis (Fourier transform) : Ptot (total power), VLF (very low-frequencies), LF (low-frequencies), HF (<b>high-frequencies),</b> LF/HF ratio, LFnu (normalized low-frequencies) and HFnu (normalized <b>high-frequencies)</b> values. RESULTS: Ptot, VLF, LF and HF were significantly lower in the preterm group at birth compared to the control group, while LFnu, HFnu and LF/HF ratio were not significantly different. The results were similar when comparing the control group to any ANS values at a given post-natal corrected age of preterm newborns. Furthermore, preterm newborns did not demonstrate any significant increase in ANS values from birth to theoretical term. CONCLUSION: The finding of substantial reduced ANS activity and failure of maturation in preterm infants up to term equivalent age needs confirming by other research groups, and mechanisms and implications for infant health explored...|$|R
