Although the sculpture received regular maintenance, early repair crews often did more harm than good, by using techniques such as sandblasting and patching cracks with rigid materials.|$|E

However, as the water level recedes in the fall, populations at the coast shift their foraging area inland, to inland marshes and swamplands. It has become more common in urban landscapes in Florida since the late 1990s, and <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of wetland-dependent bird species which forages in man-made ponds on golf courses in the southwest of the state.|$|E

The R conformation of the asymmetric carbon atom seems to be essential for GR affinity.|$|E

5|$|Tadpoles are {{typically}} herbivorous, feeding mostly on algae, including diatoms filtered {{from the water}} through the gills.

The Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of species in which the tadpoles can be cannibalistic. Tadpoles that develop legs early may be eaten by the others, so late developers may have better long-term survival prospects.|$|E
