5|$|A {{traditional}} {{musical instrument}} of the Toraja is a bamboo flute called a Pa'suling (suling is an Indonesian word for flute). This six-holed flute (not unique to the Toraja) is played at many dances, such as the thanksgiving dance Ma'bondensan, where the flute accompanies a group of shirtless, dancing men with long fingernails. The Toraja have indigenous musical instruments, such as the Pa'pelle (made from palm leaves) and the Pa'karombi (the Torajan version of a jaw harp). The Pa'pelle is played during <b>harvest</b> <b>time</b> and at house inauguration ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} {{agricultural}} societies, Torajans dance and sing during <b>harvest</b> <b>time.</b> The Ma'bugi dance celebrates the thanksgiving event, and the Ma'gandangi dance is performed while Torajans are pounding rice.

A dance called Ma'bua can be performed only once every 12 years. Ma'bua is a major Toraja ceremony in which priests wear a buffalo head and dance around a sacred tree.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effects of}} four quince <b>harvesting</b> <b>times</b> (at 10 - day intervals), in 2 years on fruit quality during cold storage for 5 months at 0 ˚C and 85 % Relative Humidity were investigated. Fruits were picked from {{orchards}} in Flavargan region of Isfahan. Every month, pH, sugar content, acidity, TSS, tissue firmness of fruits were determined. Variance analysis shows that the effect of year on TSS, sugar content, and pectin was siginificant (α = 1 %) as well as on tissue firmness (α = 5 %). <b>Harvesting</b> <b>time</b> effect was only significanrt on sugar content while storage time showed a significant effect on TSS, Sugar content and acidity of fruits. Year and <b>harvesting</b> <b>time</b> interaction effect on sugar content and TSS was significant (α= 1 %). Year and storage time interaction effect on pH, pectin and tissue firmness was significant while no significant effect on measured parameter was observed for <b>harvesting</b> <b>time</b> and storage time interaction. Simultaneous effect of year, Storage <b>time</b> and <b>harvesting</b> <b>time</b> on pH, pectin and tissue firmness was significant (α= 1 %). Meanwhile average analysis by Duncan test showed that different <b>harvesting</b> <b>times</b> had no significant effect on measured parameters except on fruit sugar content.

Six cultivars of an Iranian kenaf (Hibiscus Cannabinus L.), were planted on 19 May 2007, and harvested at 85, 105, and 135 days after planting. It was understood that {{with the increase of}} plant age, the fiber yield increased. Maximum yield at each of three <b>harvesting</b> <b>time</b> stages was related to Niger. Consequently, if a high fiber yield is sought, Niger can be recommended. But if a paper with high strength properties is to be requested, Cubano 2032 is strongly associated with significant burst, tear, breaking length, and fold endurance even though its yield shows a bit lesser than Niger at short <b>harvesting</b> <b>times.</b> Moreover, at second <b>harvesting</b> <b>time</b> stage, maximum strength properties of handsheets such as burst, tear, breaking length, and fold endurance were related to Cubano, though the fiber yield of this cultivar was a bit lesser than Niger, but it was still more than Cubano 2032.

During <b>harvest</b> <b>time</b> and the winter period the vine fares poorly {{if it is}} introduced {{to high levels of}} rain or irrigation water. This is particularly true in poor-soil plantings where the vine would need more water. Over-watering during this period accentuates the herbaceous and green pepper characteristics of the grape. The grape naturally develops high levels of sugar before the tannins achieve ripeness. If grown in too hot a climate the resulting wine will have a high alcohol level and low balance. Carménère buds and flowers three to seven days later than Merlot and the yield is lower than that of the latter grape. The Carménère leaves turn to crimson before dropping.|$|E

40|$|Survey {{of cotton}} fiber yield, in {{addition}} to the identification of its best variety can cause cotton residual enhancement. The remainder of cotton stalk in farms is an illness-causing agent and leads to yield reduction in the next cultivation stage, an event which requires burial. So the usage of cotton stalk in the pulp and paper industry,which faces a shortage of raw material, results in a reduction intillage costs, thus, fiber and stalk yield potential gain importance. In this study, we investigated the effect of variety and <b>harvesting</b> <b>time</b> on cotton yield and its components, which was obtained from experiments of the plot of the 2009 cultivation year. An amount of dry material of each part of the components was also obtained. Experiments on factors containedfive varieties: Sepid, Sahel, Armaghan, Golestan and number 200.

5|$|In the 1990s, Sauvignon blanc {{wines from}} the {{maritime}} climatic regions of New Zealand, particularly the South Island, became popular on the wine market. In the Marlborough Region, sandy soils over slate shingles {{have become the}} most desirable locations for plantings due to the good drainage of the soil and poor fertility that encourages the vine to concentrate its flavors in lower yields. In the flood plain of the Wairau River Valley, the soil runs in east-west bands across the area. This can create a wide diversity of flavors for vineyards that are planted north-south with the heavier soils producing more herbaceous wines from grapes that ripen late and vines planted in stonier soils ripening earlier and imparting more lush and tropical flavors.

Most Khmer Loeu diets are low in protein, which is limited in availability. Wild game and fish are major protein sources, and smaller animals such as rats, wild chickens, and insects are also sometimes eaten. Domestic animals such as pigs, cows, and buffaloes are only eaten when sacrifices are made. In the rainy season, many varieties of vegetables and leaves are gathered from the forest.

The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the optimal <b>harvesting</b> <b>time,</b> which can deliver improved biomass quality for combustion of novel miscanthus genotypes at various sites across Europe, without high yield losses and without compromising their environmental performance. The relevant field trials were established as part of the European project OPTIMISC with 15 genotypes at six sites across Europe. For this study, the five highest yielding genotypes from each germplasm group and three sites with contrasting climatic conditions (Stuttgart, Germany; Adana, Turkey; and Moscow, Russia) were selected for assessment. The biomass samples were collected between August and March (depending on site) and subjected to mineral and ash content analysis. At Stuttgart, the delay in <b>harvesting</b> <b>time</b> led to a significant variation in combustion quality characteristics, such as N content (0. 64 – 0. 21 %), ash content (5. 15 – 2. 60 %), and ash sintering index (1. 30 – 0. 20). At Adana, the delay in <b>harvesting</b> <b>time</b> decreased the N content from 0. 62 to 0. 23 %, ash content from 10. 63 to 3. 84 %, and sintering index from 0. 54 to 0. 07. At Moscow, the impact of delay in harvesting was not significant, except for N, Mg, and ash sintering index. Overall, a delay in <b>harvesting</b> <b>time</b> improved the combustion quality characteristics of each genotype, but at the expense of yield. Yield losses of up to 49 % in Stuttgart and Adana and 21 % for Moscow were recorded, with variations between genotypes and sites. The <b>harvesting</b> <b>time</b> also affected nutrient offtake, which in turn influences the long-term environmental performance of the crop. The highest N, P, and K offtakes were recorded at Stuttgart for each <b>harvesting</b> <b>time</b> except for final harvest (March), where Moscow had the highest N offtake.
