5|$|A {{leader of}} a party is chosen by the party, {{following}} an internal constitution unique to each party that comprises a framework to elect or appoint a leader.

If a {{leader of a}} party does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat,</b> he or she must sit in the legislature gallery. While sitting in the gallery a premier cannot exercise any legislative powers.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the final}} vote, Parliament demanded {{a number of}} {{concessions}} {{as part of a}} future working agreement under the new Lisbon Treaty.

However, Parliament secured only an observer seat. Parliament also did not secure a say over the appointment of delegation heads and special representatives for foreign policy. Although they will appear before parliament after they have been appointed by the High Representative. One major internal power was that Parliament wanted a pledge from the Commission that it would put forward legislation when parliament requests. Barroso considered this an infringement on the Commission's powers but did agree to respond within three months. Most requests are already responded to positively.|$|E

500|$|Álmos, {{according}} to Gesta Hungarorum, was freely {{elected by the}} heads of the seven Hungarian tribes as their [...] "leader and master".

Anonymus says that they also adopted the basic principles of the government, including the hereditary right of Álmos's offsprings to his office and the right of his electors' descendant to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> in the prince's council. According to author Pál Engel, this report of the [...] "treaty by blood" [...] (...) , which reflects its authors' political philosophy rather than actual events, was [...] "often presented by Hungarian historians as the very first manifestation of modern parliamentary thinking in Europe" [...] up until 1945.|$|E
500|$|France has {{explicitly}} {{called for}} a permanent seat in the UN for its close EU partner: [...] "Germany's engagement, its ranking as a great power, its international influence—France {{would like to see}} them recognized with a permanent seat on the Security Council", French president Jacques Chirac said in a speech in Berlin in 2000. The former German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, also identified Russia, among other countries, as a country that backed Germany's bid. Former President Fidel V. Ramos of the Philippines also expressed his country's support for Germany's bid, together with Japan's. Italy and the Netherlands on the contrary, suggest a common European Union seat in the Council instead of Germany becoming the third European member next to France and the UK. The former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said that Germany would also accept a common European seat, but {{as long as there is}} little sign that France and the UK will give up their own seats, Germany should also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
500|$|Just {{before the}} convention, the [...] Democratic National Committee (DNC) made initial {{determinations}} of which delegations {{were to be}} seated—once convened, delegates would make the final determination after the convention's Credentials Committee reported. [...] The DNC seated a rival, pro-gold Nebraska delegation, and recommended New York Senator David B. Hill as the convention's temporary chairman, each {{by a vote of}} 27—23. [...] Bryan was present when it was announced that his delegation would not be initially seated; reports state he acted [...] "somewhat surprised" [...] at the outcome. [...] Since the DNC action meant Bryan would not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> at the start of proceedings, he could not be the temporary chairman (who would deliver the keynote address); the Nebraskan began looking for other opportunities to make a speech at the convention. [...] Historian James A. Barnes deemed the DNC's vote immaterial; once the convention met on July 7, it quickly elected a silver man, Virginia Senator John Daniel, as temporary chairman and appointed a committee to review credentials friendly to the silver cause.|$|E
