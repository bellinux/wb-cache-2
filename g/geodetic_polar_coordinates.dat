Previously developed computer software allows using Cartesian coordinates. In some cases it is advisable to use <b>polar</b> <b>coordinate</b> system for description of projective graphics drawings. Using the example of icosahedron the authors analyzed the advantages of using projective graphics drawings in the <b>polar</b> <b>coordinate</b> system. The transition to the <b>polar</b> <b>coordinate</b> system is a tool that allows using certain patterns of projective graphics drawings in the process of calculation. When using <b>polar</b> <b>coordinate</b> system the search of Polar correspondence for the directs is simplified. In order to analyze the two lines in the <b>polar</b> <b>coordinate</b> system it is enough to compare the corresponding coefficients of the equations of these lines.

Optimization of computer programs using <b>polar</b> <b>coordinate</b> system will simplifies the calculations of projective graphics drawings, accelerates the process of constructing three-dimensional models, which expand the possibilities of selecting original solutions. Finally, the authors conclude that it is appropriate to use the <b>polar</b> <b>coordinate</b> system only in the construction of projective graphics diagrams of the planes system having rich symmetry.

A high-rate analysis is provided for an encoder that first uniformly scalar quantizes, then transforms to “integer <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates,</b> ” and finally separately entropy codes angle and radius. For sources separable in <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates,</b> the performance (at high rate) is shown to match that of entropy-constrained unconstrained polar quantization—where the angular quantization is allowed {{to depend on the}} radius. Thus, for sources separable in <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> but not separable in rectangular coordinates— including certain Gaussian scale mixtures—the proposed system performs better than any transform code. Furthermore, unlike unconstrained polar quantization, integer <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> are appropriate for lossless compression of integer-valued vectors.
