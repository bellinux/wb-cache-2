5000|$|LAPD is {{the second}} layer {{protocol}} on the <b>ISDN</b> <b>protocol</b> stack in the D channel (the ISDN channel in which the control and signalling information is carried).|$|E
50|$|Derivatives {{have since}} {{appeared}} in innumerable standards. It was adopted into the X.25 protocol stack as LAPB, into the V.42 protocol as LAPM, into the Frame Relay protocol stack as LAPF {{and into the}} <b>ISDN</b> <b>protocol</b> stack as LAPD.|$|E
5000|$|X.25 {{was also}} part of an <b>ISDN</b> <b>protocol</b> called [...] "Always On/Dynamic ISDN", or AO/DI. This allowed a user to have a {{constant}} multi-link PPP connection to the internet over X.25 on the D channel, and brought up one or two B channels as needed.|$|E
50|$|V5.1 only {{supports}} the Control, PSTN and <b>ISDN</b> <b>protocols.</b> V5.2 also supports BCC, Link Control and Protection protocols.|$|R
5000|$|QSIG is an <b>ISDN</b> based {{signaling}} <b>protocol</b> for signaling {{between private}} branch exchanges (PBXs) {{in a private}} integrated services network (PISN). It makes use of the connection-level Q.931 protocol and the application-level ROSE <b>protocol.</b> <b>ISDN</b> [...] "proper" [...] functions as the physical link layer.|$|R
50|$|The DECT {{data link}} layer uses Link Access Protocol Control (LAPC), a {{specially}} designed variant of the <b>ISDN</b> data link <b>protocol</b> called LAPD. They are based on HDLC.|$|R
5000|$|LAPF is {{formally}} {{defined in}} the International Telecommunication Union standard Q.922. It was derived from IBM's Synchronous Data Link Control protocol, which is the layer 2 protocol for IBM's Systems Network Architecture developed around 1975. ITU used SDLC as a basis to develop LAPF for the frame relay environment, along with other equivalents: LAPB for the X.25 protocol stack, LAPM for the V.42 protocol, and LAPD for the <b>ISDN</b> <b>protocol</b> stack.|$|E
50|$|Most modern non-VoIP PBXs use ISDN-PRI circuits. These are {{connected}} via T1 lines {{with the central}} office switch, replacing older analog two-way and direct inward dialing (DID) trunks. PRI is capable of delivering Calling Line Identification (CLID) in both directions so that the telephone number of an extension, rather than a companys main number, can be sent. It is still commonly used in recording studios, when a voice-over actor is in one studio (possibly telecommuting from home), but the director and producer are in a studio at another location. The <b>ISDN</b> <b>protocol</b> delivers channelized, not-over-the-Internet service, powerful call setup and routing features, faster setup and tear down, superior audio fidelity as compared to POTS (plain old telephone service), lower delay and, at higher densities, lower cost.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Interoperability testing aims at verifying the {{possibility}} for two or more components to communicate correctly while providing the foreseen services. In this paper, we describe a new method for gener-ating interoperability test cases. This method is equivalent to classical methods in terms of non-interoperability detection. Contrary to classi-cal approaches, this method avoids the well-known state-space explosion problem. It has been implemented in the CADP Toolbox and applied to a simpli ed version of the <b>ISDN</b> connection <b>protocol.</b> The obtained results con rm the real contribution of this method: test cases has been derived while classical approaches face the state-space explosion problem. ...|$|R
50|$|SIGTRAN is the name, {{derived from}} {{signaling}} transport, {{of the former}} Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) working group that produced specifications {{for a family of}} protocols that provide reliable datagram service and user layer adaptations for Signaling System 7 (SS7) and <b>ISDN</b> communications <b>protocols.</b> The SIGTRAN protocols are an extension of the SS7 protocol family. It supports the same application and call management paradigms as SS7 but uses an Internet Protocol (IP) transport called Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), instead of TCP or UDP. Indeed, the most significant protocol defined by the SIGTRAN group is SCTP, which is used to carry PSTN signaling over IP.|$|R
50|$|There is also H.320 standard, which {{specified}} {{technical requirements}} for narrow-band visual telephone systems and terminal equipment, typically for videoconferencing and videophone services. It applied mostly to dedicated circuit-based switched network (point-to-point) connections of moderate or high bandwidth, such as through the medium-bandwidth <b>ISDN</b> digital phone <b>protocol</b> or a fractionated high bandwidth T1 lines. Modern products based on H.320 standard usually support also H.323 standard.|$|R

The ISTA connects the Type 1 Network Termination (NT 1) via the U-interface on the line termination side of the CPE to the V. 35 interface for satellite uplink. The same ISTA converts in the opposite direction the V. 35 to U-interface data with a simple switch setting...|$|E

40|$|Conformance {{testing of}} {{communication}} protocols has recently {{become a major}} issue in the context of OSI-based standardization of protocols. The aim of conformance testing is to assure that a protocol fulfills an OSI specification. In this paper, a performance study is presented for a distributed protocol test system that has been installed for conformance testing of the ISDN D-channel signalling protocol. Using a general approach for performance measurements and evaluation in distributed systems, a queueing model is developed and evaluated, based on runtimes as obtained from measurements of the test system. It is demonstrated that significant performance improvements can be achieved once the process scheduling strategy at the <b>ISDN</b> <b>protocol</b> testers is properly adjusted.

40|$|The {{technique}} {{described in}} this paper {{is concerned with the}} provision of a sign language emulator driven by an array of electromagnetic sensors integrated into a pair of data gloves. The objective is to provide a 3 D visualization of the signing performed either end of the telephone link. The link requires an <b>ISDN</b> telephone <b>protocol</b> which is now actively marketed in the UK by the telecommunications industry. The objective of the work is to enable the deaf to communicate across telecommunications links. The sensing system is based on an electromagnetic imaging technique devised for key hole surgery and specifically for guidance of colonoscopes during colonoscopy in the screening and treatment of intestinal cancers. It comprises modules for generating magnetic field, sensing the magnetic field and processing the signals from the first two modules. Sensors are mounted in a pair of gloves and determine a position of the fingers and hands to enable the sign language to be read by a computer. Images could be than transferred via ISDN links anywhere in the world. This system operates in real time and with a position accuracy of a few millimeters and orientation accuracy of less than 1 degree of arc...|$|R
50|$|The Model 10 {{brought the}} power and {{applications}} of the 9751 CBX to small and medium-size business in a compact, cost-effective package. Up to 100 stations could be supported by a single modular cabinet (single shelf) system. Cabinets two and three each supporting up to 250 stations, could be added in an integrated, stackable fashion to bring the Model 10's capacity to 600 stations. The Model 10 is designed to operate in standard office environments. Release 9005 supports the 9751 CBX Model Model 10 with all the single-card interfaces and {{a full range of}} applications. The Model 10 has the same data-connectivity capability as the other 9751 CBX models, is fully data compatible, and with the optional Data Front End Processor II(DFE II), became a highly efficient system for voice and data integration. The Model 10 cannot use Cornet hardware (RPDN card); CORNet is a proprietary networking software (an extension of <b>ISDN</b> PRI <b>protocols)</b> for Siemens PBXs and the original 9751-9005 model. Also the cabinet is a different design from the other models (the Model 20 through 70 use the same cabinet design, etc.).|$|R

5000|$|Although {{the term}} {{softswitch}} technically refers to any such device, {{it is more}} conventionally applied to a device that handles IP-to-IP phone calls, while the phrase [...] "access server" [...] or [...] "media gateway" [...] is {{used to refer to}} devices that either originate or terminate traditional [...] "land line" [...] (hard wired) phone calls. In practice, such devices can often do both. As a practical distinction, a Skype-to-Skype phone call is entirely IP (internet) based, and so uses a softswitch somewhere in the middle connecting the calling party with the called party. In contrast, access servers might take a mobile call or a call originating from a traditional phone line, convert it to IP traffic, then send it over the internet to another such device, which terminates the call by reversing the process and converting the Voice over IP call back to older circuit switched digital systems using traditional digital <b>ISDN</b> / PSTN <b>protocols</b> that transmit voice traffic using non-IP systems.|$|R
40|$|Formally defined Specification and Description Language (SDL) is {{used for}} the design and {{specification}} of complex safety-critical systems. Each change in the specification of the product should be immediately checked formally against the requirements’ specification. This paper presents semi-automated system abstraction, automated model extraction, simulation, and formal verification of real-life complex SDL specification. Sound algorithms implemented in our sdl 2 pml automated model extraction tool preserve all properties of the SDL system. Sdl 2 pml includes our model of discrete time, abstraction, and support for all relevant SDL functionality and constructs such as dynamic process creation, rational data types, and communication with more than one process instance. To the best of our knowledge, most of them are not supported by any other known approach. We use our SpinRCP tool for simulation and formal verification of the extracted model with the Spin model checker. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on <b>ISDN</b> User adaptation <b>protocol</b> from SI 3000 Softswitch. The extracted Promela model is the largest one ever processed by Spin. We have shown that Spin simulation and model checking can be applied successfully to such huge models...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Our main {{objective}} was to use videoconferencing as a primary means to: a) assist in launching an epilepsy surgery program in Pakistan, 2) participate in case conferences on complex epilepsy Patients in each country. Methods: Extensive testing using both point to point and bridged integrated service digital network (<b>ISDN)</b> and internet <b>protocol</b> (IP) connections was carried out using bandwidths of 384 - 768 kilobits per second (kbps). Videoconferences between sites were arranged {{two to three weeks}} in advance and connections were tested a day prior to the scheduled conference. Sharing of PowerPoint presentations, neuroimaging and video-EEG was available to all sites. Discussions centered on Patients with medically refractory epilepsy. Results: Between July 2006 and June 2008, 17 sessions were booked. Five of these conferences bridged in specialists from West Virginia University. Most successful connections occurred using IP point to point calls or a bridge connecting end points through IP at 512 kbps. We conducted three surgeries for medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy in Pakistan. At follow-up in January 2009, two Patients have been seizure free and one had two breakthrough seizures after sudden unsupervised discontinuation of Levetiracetam. Conclusion: Our international tele-epilepsy collaboration has proven feasible and valuable to all participants. Our experience suggests considerable thought and preparation are needed before a teleconference to ensure its success. We provide a recipe to set-up similar telemedicine collaborations. Considerations include time zone differences, equipment type, interoperability between endpoints, connection capabilities, bandwidth availability, and backup plans for unsuccessful connections. Telemedicine can facilitate epilepsy care around the world, identifying with the concept of a 2 ̆ 2 Global Health Village 2 ̆ 2...|$|R
