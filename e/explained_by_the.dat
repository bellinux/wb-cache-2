5|$|Computer {{simulations}} of the dusty disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani {{suggest that the}} shape of the disk may be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of a second planet, tentatively dubbed Epsilon Eridanic. Clumping in the dust disk may occur because dust particles are being trapped in orbits that have resonant orbital periods with a planet in an eccentric orbit. The postulated Epsilon Eridanic would orbit at a distance of 40AU, with an eccentricity of 0.3 and a period of 280 years. The inner cavity of the disk may be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of additional planets. Current models of planet formation cannot easily explain how a planet could have been created at this distance from Epsilon Eridani. The disk is expected to have dissipated long before a giant planet could have formed. Instead, the planet may have formed at an orbital distance of about 10AU, then migrated outward because of gravitational interaction with the disc or with other planets in the system.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, {{there are}} no records of a {{large-scale}} Greek slave revolt {{comparable to that of}} Spartacus in Rome.

Individual acts of rebellion of slaves against their master, though scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech mentions the attempted murder of his master by a boy slave, not 12 years old.|$|E
