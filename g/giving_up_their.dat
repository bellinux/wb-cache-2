5|$|Meanwhile, at Painless Dentistry, the Simpson {{children}} {{are getting their}} teeth checked. It is discovered Lisa needs braces. When Marge informs Homer, he tells her {{not to worry about}} the cost, as the union had won a dental plan during a previous strike. Later, {{at a meeting of the}} local chapter of International Brotherhood of Jazz Dancers, Pastry Chefs and Nuclear Technicians, Carl announces that the newest contract requires the union to give up their dental plan in exchange for a free keg of beer for their meeting. Homer slowly comprehends that <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> dental plan would require him to pay for Lisa's braces and jumps into action, reminding everyone how their dental plan has helped them all.|$|E
5|$|Amidst the {{austerity}} of the inter-war years, {{the regiment}} remained in existence until 1 October 1936 {{when it was}} merged with the 24th (Gwydir) Light Horse to form the 12th/24th Light Horse. These two units were later delinked in 1938 as the Militia was expanded following increased political tensions in Europe. In March 1942, during the Second World War, the 12th Light Horse was converted to a motor regiment, known as the 12th Motor Regiment. In September 1942, it was redesignated the 12th Armoured Car Regiment, and assigned to the 3rd Armoured Division. During this period a process of mechanisation resulted {{in the last of}} the light horse units <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> horses. Throughout 1943, the Australian Army was faced with a manpower shortage and as the Japanese threat to mainland Australia decreased many Militia armoured units were broken up and their personnel sent to other units as reinforcements. As a result, the regiment was disbanded on 19 October 1943, having only undertaken garrison duty within Australia.|$|E

5|$|His death {{marked the}} {{effective}} {{end of the}} Bulgarian Empire. Ivan Vladislav's sons were young and inexperienced, and even the strongest Bulgarian leaders doubted the advisability of further resistance. Upon learning {{of the death of}} the Tsar, Basil II left Constantinople. In Adrianople he was met by the brother of Krakra who acknowledged Byzantine authority. His example was followed by the larger part of the Bulgarian nobility who pledged loyalty to Basil II, <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> fortresses. In Serres, Krakra along with the commanders of 35 castles met the emperor and surrendered, and in Strumitsa he received a message sent by the Empress-dowager Maria to negotiate the surrender of the capital and the country. Basil II richly awarded those who surrendered, allowing them to keep their lands, wealth and titles. Short-lived resistance continued under Ivan Vladislav's eldest son Presian II and his brothers, but they also surrendered by the end of 1018.|$|E
5|$|The outpost is {{evacuated}} {{during the}} dangerous mission, {{leaving only the}} Enterprise away team on surface. The firestorms overwhelm the position that Daren's team occupies {{before they can be}} retrieved. Believing Daren to be dead, Picard sits contemplating his decision in his quarters. He then hears that survivors are being transported aboard, and heads to the transporter room. Daren is not among the initial group of survivors, but is later transported to the ship. Eight members of the team have died. Afterwards, Picard and Daren discuss their relationship. They conclude that it cannot continue, as Picard could not bear to put her in danger once more. They discuss <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> Starfleet careers to be together. Daren realizes that Picard, still cherishing the family life he experienced as Kamin, has nonetheless chosen duty, career, and loneliness. They both know that Daren must transfer off the Enterprise. They kiss once more, and Daren makes Picard promise not to give up music.|$|E

25|$|Land {{ownership}} in the region rests with the native authority, which must obtain community consent for land transfers. The local people, with reason, are suspicious of government promises that they will receive long-term economic assistance in exchange for <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> land, and instead demand exorbitant cash payment. This has frustrated efforts to incorporate the Afi River Forest Reserve and the Mbe Mountains Community Forest into the park, preventing more effective conservation efforts.|$|E

25|$|New Amsterdam {{was renamed}} New York on September 8, 1664, {{in honor of}} the Duke of York (later James II of England), in whose name the English had {{captured}} it. After the Second Anglo-Dutch War of 16651667, England and the United Provinces of the Netherlands agreed to the status quo in the Treaty of Breda. The English kept the island of Manhattan, the Dutch <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> claim to the town {{and the rest of the}} colony, while the English formally abandoned the island of Run in the East Indies to the Dutch, confirming their control of the valuable Spice Islands. Today much of what was once New Amsterdam is New York City.|$|E
25|$|Medium {{frequency}} (MF) {{and lower}} high frequency (HF) radio waves are significantly attenuated within the D layer, as the passing radio waves cause electrons to move, which then collide with the neutral molecules, <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> energy. Lower frequencies experience greater absorption because they move the electrons farther, leading to {{greater chance of}} collisions. This {{is the main reason}} for absorption of HF radio waves, particularly at 10nbsp&MHz and below, with progressively less absorption at higher frequencies. This effect peaks around noon and is reduced at night due to a decrease in the D layer's thickness; only a small part remains due to cosmic rays. A common example of the D layer in action is the disappearance of distant AM broadcast band stations in the daytime.|$|E
25|$|Due to faster tribal {{population}} growth in forest / tribal areas, naturally available forest resources (NTFP) in a sustainable manner are becoming inadequate for their basic livelihood. Many tribal are <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> traditional livelihood and taking up farming and cattle rearing in the forest areas causing irreparable damage to forests. The erstwhile protectors of forests are slowly turning into the bane of forests and its wildlife. The government should devise schemes to avert this process and save the dwindling forest area and its flora and fauna. Tribal people have extraordinary understanding of forest flora and fauna which can be productively utilized. All the tribal peoples shall be employed {{by the government in}} the expansion and protection of forests and its wildlife till their descendants get educated and diversify into industrial and service sectors.|$|E

25|$|In the {{minority}} is the scholar Simon Kingston, who has recently argued, using {{an absence of}} evidence is not evidence of absence approach, that the MacDonnells did in fact gain the upper hand to become dominant in the Glens following the marriage of Margery Byset to John Mór MacDonnell. His approach disregards {{the lack of a}} MacDonnell presence in the Irish sources and English ones covering Irish affairs in favour of assuming the accuracy of the MacDonnell claims and styles prior to the 1520s. What is unknown is whether the Bissetts ever recognised the nominal overlordship of the much more powerful Scottish dynasty still based in the Western Isles, a different species of submission from <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> lordship itself. If so then the MacDonnell claims could be understood differently, but remain unverifiable. Kenneth Nicholls finds Bissett acceptance of the MacDonnell intrusion unlikely and military retaliation probable.|$|E
25|$|The Treaty {{established}} a British Governor of New Zealand, recognised Māori ownership of their lands, forests, and other properties, and gave Māori {{the rights of}} British subjects. An immediate result of the Treaty was that Queen Victoria's government gained the sole right to purchase land. Because the English and Māori versions of the Treaty differed significantly, {{there is no consensus}} as to exactly what was agreed upon. From the British point of view, the Treaty gave Britain sovereignty over New Zealand, and gave the Governor the right to govern the country. Māori believed they ceded to the Crown a right of governance in return for protection, without <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> authority to manage their own affairs. After the initial signing at Waitangi, copies of the Treaty were taken around New Zealand, and, over the following months, many other chiefs signed. In total there are nine copies of the Treaty of Waitangi, including the original signed on 6 February 1840. Around 530 to 540 Māori, at least 13 of them women, signed the Treaty of Waitangi.|$|E

After the War Germany and Berlin witnessed a period of politically driven civil conflict known as the German Revolution during which the imperial government was replaced by the Weimar Republic. As a notable feminist and union official Luise Kähler was instrumental in leading her Union through the turmoil caused by the civil unrest. The new republic in Germany needed to reform its archaic domestic servant laws particularly since thousands of domestic workers were <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> employment as the economy of the Weimar Republic went into free fall. Many smaller unions survived only by merging into larger conglomerations.|$|E
