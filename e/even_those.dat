5|$|In {{voting against}} the Force Bill, Tyler {{knew he would}} {{permanently}} alienate the pro-Jackson faction of the Virginia legislature, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> who had tolerated his irregularity up to this point. This jeopardized his re-election in February 1833, in which he faced the pro-administration Democrat James McDowell; however, with Clay's endorsement, Tyler was re-elected {{by a margin of}} 12 votes.|$|E
5|$|With their closed valence shells, {{the noble}} gases {{have the highest}} first {{ionization}} potentials in each of their periods, and feeble interatomic forces of attraction, with the latter property resulting in very low melting and boiling points. That is why they are all gases under standard conditions, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> with atomic masses larger than many normally solid elements.|$|E
5|$|Aspiration {{may also}} be {{considered}} in secondary pneumothorax of moderate size (air rim 1–2cm) without breathlessness, with the difference that ongoing observation in hospital is required even after a successful procedure. American professional guidelines state that all large pneumothoraces – <b>even</b> <b>those</b> due to PSP – should be treated with a chest tube. Moderately sized iatrogenic traumatic pneumothoraces (due to medical procedures) may initially be treated with aspiration.|$|E

5|$|Backcountry hiking is {{available}} in the Craters of the Moon Wilderness and the much larger Backcountry Area beyond (added in 2000). Only two trails enter the wilderness area and <b>even</b> <b>those</b> stop after a few miles or kilometers. From there most hikers follow the Great Rift and explore its series of seldom-visited volcanic features. All overnight backcountry hikes require registration with a ranger. No drinking water {{is available}} in the backcountry and the dry climate quickly dehydrates hikers. Avoiding summer heat and winter cold are therefore recommended by rangers. Pets, camp fires, and all mechanized vehicles, including bicycles, are not allowed in the wilderness area.|$|E
5|$|Boron is an {{essential}} plant nutrient, required primarily for maintaining the integrity of cell walls. However, high soil concentrations of greater than 1.0ppm lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance. Levels as low as 0.8ppm produce these same symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> somewhat tolerant of soil boron, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when soil boron content is greater than 1.8ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive.|$|E
5|$|Capital {{within the}} EU may be {{transferred}} in any amount {{from one country}} to another. All intra-EU transfers in euro are treated as domestic transactions and bear the corresponding domestic transfer costs. This includes all member states of the EU, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> outside the eurozone providing the transactions are carried out in euro. Credit/debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within the eurozone are also treated as domestic transactions; however paper-based payment orders, like cheques, have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based. The ECB has also set up a clearing system, TARGET, for large euro transactions.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{placed a}} {{symbolic}} emphasis on rebuilding royal authority, but his rule was relatively circumscribed by Magna Carta. He generally acted within {{the terms of}} the charters, which prevented the Crown from taking extrajudicial action against the barons, including the fines and expropriations that had been common under his father, John. The charters did not address the sensitive issues of the appointment of royal advisers and the distribution of patronage, and they lacked any means of enforcement if the King chose to ignore them. The inconsistency with which he applied the charters {{over the course of his}} rule alienated many barons, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> within his own faction.|$|E
5|$|Hindenburg never {{responded to}} the memo, and it remains unclear whether he even saw it, as Otto Meißner, who decided that his future was aligned with the Nazis, may not have passed it along. It is {{noteworthy}} that <b>even</b> <b>those</b> officers who were most offended by the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not blame the purge on Hitler, whom {{they wanted to see}} continue as Chancellor, and at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to remove some of Hitler's more radical followers.|$|E
5|$|In his Cabinet appointments, Pierce {{sought to}} unite {{a party that}} was squabbling over the fruits of victory. Most of the party had not {{originally}} supported him for the nomination, and some had allied with the Free Soil party to gain victory in local elections. Pierce decided to allow each of the party's factions some appointments, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> that had not supported the Compromise of 1850.|$|E

5|$|In the 1941 {{legislative}} session, Johnson vetoed {{a measure}} allowing {{the sale of}} alcoholic beverages to surrounding states, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> with laws forbidding alcohol sales. The bill was very popular, and was supported {{by many of the}} state's powerful special interests. It had passed the Kentucky House of Representatives by a vote of 84–0 and the Kentucky Senate by a vote of 31–3. After Johnson's veto, the House reversed itself, voting 86–3 to sustain the veto.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the sixth book, Clement intends to demonstrate that the works of Greek poets were derived from the prophetic books of the Bible. In order to reinforce his position that the Greeks were inclined towards plagiarism, he cites numerous instances of such inappropriate appropriation by classical Greek writers, reported second-hand from On Plagiarism, an anonymous 3rd century BC work sometimes ascribed to Aretades. Clement then digresses to the subject of sin and hell, arguing that Adam was not perfect when created, but given the potential to achieve perfection. He espouses broadly universalist doctrine, holding that Christ's promise of salvation is available to all, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> condemned to hell.|$|E
5|$|Iron {{and steel}} are used widely in the {{construction}} of roads, railways, other infrastructure, appliances, and buildings. Most large modern structures, such as stadiums and skyscrapers, bridges, and airports, are supported by a steel skeleton. <b>Even</b> <b>those</b> with a concrete structure employ steel for reinforcing. In addition, it sees widespread use in major appliances and cars. Despite growth in usage of aluminium, it is still the main material for car bodies. Steel is used in a variety of other construction materials, such as bolts, nails, and screws and other household products and cooking utensils.|$|E

5|$|It is {{wonderful}} {{that both of}} these things occurred under Valerian; {{and it is the}} more remarkable in this case when we consider his previous conduct, for he had been mild and friendly toward the men of God, for none of the emperors before him had treated them so kindly and favorably; and not <b>even</b> <b>those</b> who were said openly to be Christians received them with such manifest hospitality and friendliness as he did {{at the beginning of his}} reign.

5|$|Keynes's {{economic}} thinking only {{began to}} achieve close to universal acceptance {{in the last}} few years of his life. On a personal level, Keynes's charm was such that he was generally well received wherever he went – <b>even</b> <b>those</b> who found themselves on the wrong side of his occasionally sharp tongue rarely bore a grudge. Keynes's speech at the closing of the Bretton Woods negotiations was received with a lasting standing ovation, rare in international relations, as the delegates acknowledged the scale of his achievements made despite poor health.|$|E
5|$|Krishna's {{childhood}} {{illustrates the}} Hindu concept of lila, playing {{for fun and}} enjoyment and not for sport or gain. His interaction with the gopis at the rasa dance or Rasa-lila is an example. Krishna plays his flute and the gopis come immediately, from whatever they were doing, to {{the banks of the}} Yamuna River, and join him in singing and dancing. <b>Even</b> <b>those</b> who could not physically be there join him through meditation. He is the spiritual essence and the love-eternal in existence, the gopis metaphorically represent the prakṛti matter and the impermanent body.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{encephalopathy}} is {{a medical}} emergency and causes permanent brain damage in 70–80% of children affected by it, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> that receive the best treatment. The mortality rate for people who develop cerebral involvement is about 25%, and of those who survive who had lead encephalopathy symptoms by the time chelation therapy was begun, about 40% have permanent neurological problems such as cerebral palsy.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) {{typically}} {{store their}} genomes {{on a single}} large, circular chromosome. Similarly, some eukaryotic organelles contain a remnant circular chromosome with {{a small number of}} genes. Prokaryotes sometimes supplement their chromosome with additional small circles of DNA called plasmids, which usually encode only a few genes and are transferable between individuals. For example, the genes for antibiotic resistance are usually encoded on bacterial plasmids and can be passed between individual cells, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> of different species, via horizontal gene transfer.|$|E
