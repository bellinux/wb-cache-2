5|$|In the ground, they dig for {{earthworms}} and grubs, {{and they}} search for beetles, cicada, crickets, flies, weta, spiders, caterpillars, slugs and snails on the ground. They will also feed on berries and seeds. To find prey, the great spotted kiwi use their scenting skills or feel vibrations {{caused by the}} movement of their prey. To do the latter, a kiwi would stick its beak <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> then use its beak to dig <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> As they are nocturnal, they do not emerge until thirty minutes after sunset to begin the hunt. Kiwis will also swallow small stones, which aid in digestion.|$|E
5|$|Many shells {{exploded}} in the trees, sending shards of steel and wood <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> but the men were protected by their reinforced foxholes. The German guns cut deep holes the size of trucks in the pasture.|$|E

Baker was buried in a small military cemetery near Toul; in 1921, his mother had his remains moved to her family plot in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Built in the {{vicinity}} of an older church, the Church of St Demetrius is a crossed-dome stone building. According to several legends, the church was dug <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> as the Ottomans conquered Bulgaria, so that it may be protected from desecration. It was only unearthed {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, when it was dedicated to Saint Demetrius. It was proclaimed a monument of culture of national importance in 1956.|$|E
5|$|In Zambia, Gryllotalpa africana is held {{to bring}} {{good fortune to}} anyone who sees it.

5|$|On 18 November 1966, a B-52G AF Ser.

The crew {{was on a}} low level terrain avoidance night mission, before SAC stopped such flights, and had just entered low altitude and were calibrating their terrain avoidance radar, when they flew too low, clipped {{the tops of the}} forest and crashed.|$|E
5|$|Rockwell workers mixed {{hazardous}} {{and other}} wastes with concrete to create one-ton solid blocks called pondcrete. These were {{stored in the}} open under tarps on asphalt pads. The pondcrete {{turned out to be}} weak storage, an outcome that had been predicted by Rockwell's own engineers. Relatively unprotected from the elements, the blocks began to leak and sag. Nitrates, cadmium and low-level radioactive waste began to leach <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and run downhill toward Walnut Creek and Woman Creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{courses of}} the rivers Parrett, Somerset Axe, Brue and Cary {{run across the}} Somerset Levels and have {{generally}} been changed to improve the flow. The River Axe rises from Wookey Hole Caves, due to water draining <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> at swallet holes {{on top of the}} Mendips. The river passes through Panborough Moor, Wedmore Moor, Ox Moor, Stoke Moor and Mark Moor and reaches the sea at Uphill (near Weston-super-Mare) on Bridgwater Bay.|$|E

5|$|The {{mid-19th century}} burial ground at Ford Park Cemetery was reopened in 2007 by a {{successful}} trust and the City council operate two large early 20th century cemeteries at Weston Mill and Efford both with crematoria and chapels. There {{is also a}} privately owned cemetery {{on the outskirts of}} the city, Drake Memorial Park which does not allow headstones to mark graves, but a brass plaque set <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
5|$|The pyramid has a T-shaped {{substructure}} with a descending corridor {{leading to}} a chamber with a gabled roof.

5|$|The team {{started their}} SEC {{schedule}} back {{up with a}} trip to South Carolina. The Gamecocks were not much of an opponent, as the ladies more than doubled their points at the half (53–26), and finished the game 94–52. This game was followed up with another highly ranked opponent, the twelfth-ranked Gators. Once again, the Vols ran a talented team <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> as they only allowed 18 first half points, ultimately winning by a score of 99–60.|$|E

5|$|All Stuka {{units were}} moved to Germany's eastern border in {{preparation}} for the invasion of Poland. On the morning of 15 August 1939, during a mass-formation dive-bombing demonstration for high-ranking commanders of the Luftwaffe at Neuhammer training grounds near Sagan, 13 Ju 87s and 26 crew members were lost when they crashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> almost simultaneously. The planes dived through cloud, expecting to release their practice bombs and pull out of the dive once below the cloud ceiling, unaware that on that particular day the ceiling was too low and unexpected ground mist formed, leaving them no time {{to pull out of the}} dive.|$|E
5|$|Another legend {{tells of}} the digging of the church <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> after the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria (14th–15th centuries), so that the Ottomans would not desecrate it. According to that story, the church was buried and {{forgotten}} about by the villagers until the mid-19th century, when a local coincidentally rediscovered it while tying his donkey to a nearby cherry tree. A different version places the cherry tree {{on top of the}} hill under which the church stood. Reportedly, that cherry tree was struck by a thunderbolt, which enabled the villagers to reach the buried gate through the now-hollow trunk. The church was reconsecrated soon thereafter and dedicated to the 4th-century military saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki.|$|E

He asks Krusty for help, but Krusty informs Bart that he has already helped the Duff Brewery set up free laser gun stands around Springfield. Bart then goes to his father, Homer, for help, and the duo quickly pursue Kang and Kodos to the brewery. However, the aliens escape, and before departing, they reveal that they have already {{released}} Buzz Cola throughout Springfield's water supply.

5|$|As Gears of War 2 begins, the COG army is mobilizing to send {{forces into}} the depths of Sera to assault the Locust directly.

5|$|Burial customs, {{at least}} in {{southern}} Poland, included raising kurgans. The urn with the ashes {{was placed on the}} mound or on a post thrust <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> In that position, few such urns survived, which may be the reason why Slavic burial sites in Poland are rare. All dead, regardless of social status, were cremated and afforded a burial, according to Arab testimonies (one {{from the end of the}} 9th century and another one from about 930). A Slavic funeral feast practice was also mentioned earlier by Theophylact Simocatta.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} 1973. The airport {{needed to be}} built on permafrost. The runway is {{insulated}} against the ground, so it will not melt during the summer. The hangar is frozen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> with the pillars being melted into place and then being frozen stuck. The runway was plagued with frost heave due to an incorrect construction method, forcing the airport to regularly re-asphalt the runway. In 1989, parts of the runway were re-insulated, giving these areas that previously had been the worst an acceptable solution. In 2006, this measure {{was conducted on the}} remaining parts of the runway. An upgrade to the terminal building to allow larger capacity was completed in 2007.|$|E
