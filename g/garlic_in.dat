Objectives: This research was conducted to compare the level of lead and cadmium con-tamination <b>in</b> <b>garlic</b> species planted <b>in</b> Ramhormoz and Rasht and discuss about {{the source of this}} contaminations. Materials and Methods: Twenty composite samples were collected from each province, Khozestan (Ramhormoz) and Gilan (Rasht). Each sample was burned according to in-struction reported in AOAC. Then the white residue was dissolved in diluted nitric acid then the Pb and Cd contents were determined using graphite furnace atomic absorp-tion spectrometer at 217 and 228. 8 nm, respectively.

25|$|Garlic {{is easy to}} {{grow and}} can be grown year-round in mild climates. While sexual {{propagation}} of garlic is possible, {{nearly all of the}} <b>garlic</b> <b>in</b> cultivation is propagated asexually, by planting individual cloves in the ground. In colder climates, cloves are planted in the autumn, about six weeks before the soil freezes, and harvested in late spring or early summer. The cloves must be planted deep enough to prevent freeze/thaw, which causes mold or white rot.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 Cochrane review found eight {{clinical}} trials examining garlic {{as a treatment}} for the common cold; it excluded seven due to methodological flaws. The remaining trial, having moderate quality of evidence, concluded that people who took garlic (dietary supplement with 180 milligrams of allicin content) daily over a three-month period had fewer colds. The review indicated there is insufficient evidence {{to determine the effects of}} <b>garlic</b> <b>in</b> preventing or treating the common cold. Other reviews concluded a similar absence of high-quality evidence for garlic having a significant effect on the common cold.|$|E
25|$|Around the Mediterranean, {{such as in}} Portugal, Spain, Morocco, Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Turkey, the midveins of the rosette {{leaves of}} S. hispanicus, known in Spain as cardillo, are used as a popular wild food. It is {{generally}} gathered in April and May. These midveins are preboiled and lightly fried with <b>garlic</b> <b>in</b> olive oil. These serve as garnish for cocido. Fried cardillo is further combined with garlic, cured ham and hard-boiled or scrambled eggs. Midveins are also used raw in salads. The roots are cooked and eaten, and compare in taste to salsify. Roasted roots {{have been used as}} a coffee substitute. Florets have been used as imitation saffron.|$|E

25|$|Odia cuisine {{refers to}} the cooking of the eastern Indian state of Odisha. Foods from this area are rich and varied, while relying heavily on local ingredients. The {{flavours}} are usually subtle and delicately spiced, quite unlike the fiery curries typically associated with Indian cuisine. Fish and other seafood such as crab and shrimp are very popular. Chicken and mutton are also consumed, but somewhat occasionally. Only 6% {{of the population of}} Odisha is vegetarian, and this is reflected in its cuisine. The oil base used is mostly mustard oil, but in festivals ghee is used. Panch phutana, a mix of cumin, mustard, fennel, fenugreek and kalonji (nigella) is widely used for tempering vegetables and dals, while garam masala (curry powder) and haladi (turmeric) are commonly used for non-vegetarian curries. Pakhala, a dish made of rice, water, and yogurt, that is fermented overnight, is very popular in summer, particularly in the rural areas. Oriyas are very fond of sweets and no Oriya repast is considered complete without some dessert at the end. Festivals and fasts witness a cuisine without onion and garlic, whereas other days witness an aroma of garlic and onion paste in curries. One can find restaurants serving food without onion and <b>garlic</b> <b>in</b> major places like Puri and other coastal area, which is run by Brahmin owners.|$|E

The name [...] "Wario" [...] is a portmanteau of [...] "Mario" [...] with the Japanese adjective [...] meaning [...] "bad"; hence, a [...] "bad Mario" [...] (further symbolized by the [...] "W" [...] on his hat, an upside down [...] "M"). Official Nintendo lore states that Wario was a childhood rival to Mario and Luigi who became jealous of their success. Voice actor Charles Martinet, who has voiced Mario since 1995, is also the voice for Wario. During the audition for the part, Martinet was told to speak in a mean and gruff-sounding tone. He described voicing Wario as a looser task than voicing Mario, since Mario's speaking manner and personality are more free-flowing, rising {{from the ground and}} floating into the air, while one of Wario's cornerstones is jealousy.

2500|$|The use of <b>garlic</b> <b>in</b> China {{dates back}} {{thousands}} of years. It was consumed by ancient Greek and Roman soldiers, sailors, and rural classes (Virgil, Ecologues ii. 11), and, according to Pliny the Elder (Natural History xix. 32), by the African peasantry. Galen eulogized {{it as the}} [...] "rustic's theriac" [...] (cure-all) (see F. Adams' Paulus Aegineta, p.99), and Alexander Neckam, a writer of the 12th century (see Wright's edition of his works, p.473, 1863), discussed it as a palliative for {{the heat of the}} sun in field labor. Garlic was placed by the ancient Greeks on the piles of stones at crossroads, as a supper for Hecate (Theophrastus, Characters, The Superstitious Man). According to Pliny, garlic and onions were invoked as deities by the Egyptians at the taking of oaths.|$|E

The great reed-mace adorns the Itchen, and going along the disused towing path of the canal there is to be found abundance of the black and golden spikes of the sedge, and the curious balls of the bur-reed, very like the horrid German weapon called a morning star. Also meadow-sweet, meadow-rue, and comfrey of every shade of purple, the water avens and forget-me-not, also that loveliest plant the bog-bean, with trefoil leaves and feathery blossoms. Orchis latifolia is in plenty, and also Orchis incarnata, sometimes called the Romsey orchis. Of late years the mimulus has gilded the bank of one of the ditches. Is it compensation for the Pinguicula vulgaris, which has been drained away, or the mountain pink at Highbridge, which I suspect some gardener of appropriating? Higher up the course of the river, Orchis conopsea, long-spurred and very sweet, the compact Orchis pyramidalis, and the rare Epipactis palustris are to be found, as well as Campanula Glomerata, and crow <b>garlic,</b> <b>in</b> an old chalk-pit nearly destroyed by the railway and the water works.|$|E
