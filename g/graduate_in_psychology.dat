50|$|Regina started {{anchoring}} {{when she}} was nine for Splash, a kids' channel and {{then moved on to}} work in commercials. Aged 16, she shot for her first film, Kanda Naal Mudhal directed by V. Priya, which also starred Prasanna, Laila and Karthik Kumar. In the film, Regina portrayed Latha, the 21-year-old pregnant sister of Laila's character, and has since mentioned that people still {{find it hard to believe}} it was her in that role, as she was very young and wore no make-up. She then appeared alongside fellow newcomer Yogi in Azhagiya Asura, which won good reviews. However the film's low-key release meant that the film failed to gain attention, so she took time out from films and then went on to <b>graduate</b> <b>in</b> <b>psychology</b> from Women's Christian College, Chennai and took another year off before taking a final call on joining movies. During her break she also acted in several short films, most notably Balaji Mohan's Kadhalil Sodhappuvadhu Yeppadi alongside Adith Arun, which was later made into a feature film in 2012 under the same name.|$|E
40|$|The {{participation}} {{of people from}} ethnic minorities in UK higher education is {{greater than that of}} White people. Nevertheless, students from ethnic minorities are less likely to obtain "good" degrees (those awarded with first or upper second-class honours) than are White students. This article discusses some possible causes and implications of this attainment gap. It is equally apparent in graduates who have taken courses by distance learning with the Open University, including those who <b>graduate</b> <b>in</b> <b>psychology,</b> and it is equally apparent in the grades awarded to students who have taken the courses that make up the psychology degree. This pattern may apply to other groups who are the focus of attempts to widen access to UK higher education. It is premature to promote the idea of widening participation in such groups unless they can be guaranteed equity in terms of their subsequent attainment...|$|E

40|$|After {{attending}} this presentation, attendees {{will understand}} the importance of the existential narrative that underlies the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, as a means of understanding how rare criminal events can occur. This presentation will impact the forensic science community by serving {{as an example of how}} the individual life path is influenced by an infinite number of more or less pathological relationships. The “demoniac” theme has not disappeared from the cultural representations of the sacred, the spiritual, the religious, and are understood as attempts to draw causal connections in order to defend man from the unknown, which has always inspired terror. It seems like a paradox, but the more rational society becomes, the more humans seem to need to tap into the universe of the irrational, the sacred, and the supernatural. If this complex cultural and anthropological horizon is combined with psychiatric disease, the scene is set and the risk factors for becoming perpetrators or victims of crime will increase. This presentation introduces the case of a matricide by a 60 -year-old woman, a <b>graduate</b> <b>in</b> <b>psychology</b> with a family history of psychiatric disease and a complex sentimental relationship. The woman was diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder with maniacal symptoms, drug abuse, and had undergone two previous obligatory health treatments. She then began to adopt spiritual therapy, recommended to her by a friend, and suspended traditional drug therapy, using cannabis and alternative therapies. In May 2015, she went to her mother’s home for a “therapeutic vocation” (to look after her mother), bringing with her a medicinal syrup recommended by the spiritual therapist for her mother, who suffered from respiratory disease. At the mother’s home, she suffered an episode of acute psychotic decompensation in which she became convinced that an evil spell had been cast over the home. This became a fixed idea, and she suffered mood changes and pathological bursts of excitement. On the morning of the homicide, convinced that there were objects evoking negative presences, she created havoc in the home, believing that the devil was concealed inside her mother’s throat (because of her respiratory problems). In the throes of an agitated mystical frenzy, she placed a holy card and a rosary into her mother’s throat. A second holy card was later found crumpled in her mother’s mouth, imprinted with the words, “Satan leave this house, leave my mother and my sister. ” At the coroner’s autopsy, numerous excoriations were seen on the face (due to the violence of the aggression), evident hematomas in the back of the mouth, particularly in the pharyngeal region, blood in the bronchi, as well as areas of pulmonary emphysema alternating with areas of atelectasia; these led the specialist to conclude that death was caused by asphyxia due to obstruction of the upper airways (internal asphyxia). The choice of homicidal mode is particularly suggestive: suffocation with a “sacred” object, the holy card. The victim had a typical paradoxical psychotic profile; to chase away the demon, to extinguish and definitively silence the demoniac spirit voice, and to save her from evil, the mother was killed with the use of a sacred object. There are an infinite number of more or less “pathological relationships” around us that affect choices, life paths, and chances of fulfilment. Some, definitely abnormal, can certainly have a stronger effect on the life story of an individual; however, crime (and matricide is no exception) is potentially the result of many factors. 1 Identifying the cause as mental disease is not enough; only the analysis of the entire relationship between the perpetrator and the victim can contribute to discerning the background leading to such remarkable, shocking events. 2, 3 Reference(s) : 1.

40|$|Neste trabalho se investiga como os profissionais de Gest?o de Pessoas (GP) / Recursos Humanos (RH) mobilizam as suas compet?ncias em situa??o de trabalho. O discurso da compet?ncia ganha destaque enquanto modelo de gest?o de recursos humanos, constatando-se uma forte mudan?a no modelo de julgamento avaliativo sobre a m?o-deobra que passa a valorizar um novo perfil de trabalhador capaz de inventar as respostas em um ambiente t?cnico e social complexo e inst?vel. Embora o modelo de gest?o de recursos humanos esteja centrado no discurso da compet?ncia e mesmo com o reconhecimento da necessidade de transforma??o das pr?ticas de GP / RH para atender ?s novas demandas, parece n?o haver, ao lado dessas necessidades, estudos suficientes que tratem do trabalho no dia a dia dos profissionais que atuam nessa ?rea. Desse modo, cabe conhecer que compet?ncias esses profissionais mobilizam para atender as demandas que se dirigem a eles em seu cotidiano. Para isso, esse estudo tem como objetivo geral compreender como os profissionais de GP / RH mobilizam as suas compet?ncias em situa??o de trabalho. Tal prop?sito se desdobra nos seguintes objetivos espec?ficos: identificar as compet?ncias que os profissionais da ?rea de GP / RH mobilizam nas situa??es de trabalho; evidenciar como fazem para enfrentar as variabilidades que se apresentam; detectar que inova??es produzem frente ?quelas variabilidades; identificar que compet?ncias julgam necess?rias, mesmo que ainda n?o as possuam. O aporte te?rico desse estudo se baseia nas contribui??es oriundas dos debates sobre compet?ncia, sobretudo a partir da obra de Philippe Zarifian transpassado por um olhar da Ergologia atrav?s das reflex?es trazidas por Yves Schwartz. Quanto ao m?todo, essa pesquisa se caracteriza por ser um estudo de campo, feito atrav?s da explora??o de aspectos qualitativos dos discursos dos participantes. O instrumento utilizado foi o roteiro de entrevista semiestruturada. Para a an?lise dos dados, a perspectiva adotada foi a an?lise de conte?do com recorte por temas. Participaram dessa pesquisa, onze profissionais da ?rea de Gest?o de Pessoas / Recursos Humanos que trabalhavam em empresas situadas na Regi?o Metropolitana de Jo?o Pessoa / PB. Desses participantes, nove s?o do sexo feminino e dois s?o do sexo masculino. A idade m?dia dos participantes do sexo masculino ? de 43 anos, enquanto que a idade m?dia das participantes ? de 28 anos. No que se refere ao grau de escolaridade, as nove participantes possuem como forma??o inicial a gradua??o em Psicologia, enquanto que os participantes do sexo masculino possuem forma??o na ?rea de Administra??o. No que se refere ? mobiliza??o das compet?ncias em situa??es de trabalho, ficou evidente a rela??o entre a forma??o profissional, o aperfei?oamento profissional e as compet?ncias espec?ficas que se manifestam no dia a dia de trabalho para o acionamento das compet?ncias compet?ncia em a??o dos profissionais de GP/ RH. This work investigates how the {{professionals}} of Personnel Management (PM) / Human Resources (RH) mobilize their competences in work situations. The discourse of competence gained prominence {{as a model}} of human resource management, indicating a strong change in the model of evaluative judgments about workmanship that goes to appreciate a new profile of worker capable of inventing the answers in a technical environment and social complex and unstable [...] Although the model of human resource management was being centered in the discourse of competence and, despite the recognition of the need to change the practices of PM / HR to answer the new demands, it is observed that there are not sufficient studies that deal with the day to day work of professionals who working in this area. Thus, {{it is important to know}} the mobilized competencies by these professionals to answer the demands that go with them in their daily lives. For this, the general objective of this study is to understand how {{the professionals}} who working in this area mobilize their competencies in work situations. Such purpose unfolds in the following specific objectives: to identify the competencies that professionals in PM / HR mobilize in work situations; show how they do to deal with the variability that could arise; detect innovations that they produce when variabilities appear; identify competencies that they judge necessary, even if they do not yet have. The theoretical contribution of this study is based on contributions from the discussions on competence, especially from the work of Philippe Zarifian pierced by a glance through the reflections of Ergology brought by Yves Schwartz. As to the method, this research is characterized by a field study done by exploiting qualitative aspects of the speeches of the participants. The instrument used was the semi-structured interview guide. For data analysis, the content analysis was chose, with clipping themes. Participated in the survey, eleven professionals in Personnel Management / Human Resources who working in companies located in the metropolitan area of Jo?o Pessoa / PB. Of these participants, nine were female and two are male. The average age of male participants is 43 years while the average age of participants is 28 years. With regard to educational level, the nine women participants have training as a <b>graduate</b> <b>in</b> <b>Psychology,</b> while male participants have training in Administration. Regarding the mobilization of competences in work situations, it became clear the relationship between vocational training, professional development and the specific skills that manifest themselves in day to day work to drive competence - competence in action - from professionals GP / HR...|$|E
