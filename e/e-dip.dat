40|$|Many {{applications}} of plasma physics {{are related to}} light generation. The applications range from TL-tubes until the latest flat displays. The size of discharges is decreasing further and further. At this moment the typical dimensions of a plasma display panel cell are {{in the order of}} 100 µm. A model has been developed in the plasma group at Eindhoven to describe these microdischarges [1]. To verify and further improve the model experimental data is needed. Therefore diagnostic tools for this kind of discharge are developed. A laser absorption technique has already been developed by Tachibana et. al. [2]. The diagnostic gives a good insight of the temporal and spatial evolution of metastable xenon in this kind of microdischarge. The diagnostic discussed in this paper tries to use these metastables to measure the electric field. In figure 1 the scheme is depicted. In this scheme the two metastable levels, two resonant levels and the emission dip spectroscopy (<b>e-dip)</b> scheme is illustrated. The <b>e-dip</b> spectroscopy is based on the scheme used e. g. by Döbele et. al. [3] to measure electric field strengths in hydrogen and helium discharges. Xenon is a rare atom and has a closed shell structure in the ground state described in Russell-Saunders notation as 1 S 0. Exciting one electron out of this structure will leave an inner ion core. This core can have two possible configurations according to Russell-Saunders coupling, 2 P 3 / 2 or the 2 P 1 / 2 configuration. Racah notation is used to describe the excited levels. 6 s[3 / 2] 2 says that the outer electron is excited to the 6 s shell. There is no prime so the inner core has 2 P 3 / 2 configuration. The angular momentum of the outer electron is coupled with the total angular momentum of the core resulting in 3 / 2 + 0 = 3 / 2. The total angular momentum is now 3 / 2 + 1 / 2 (spin) = 2. The transition from 6 p[3 / 2] 2 to 6 s[3 / 2] 2 at 823. 2 nm is one of the strongest lines in the xenon spectrum. In this diagnostic we will excite some {{of the population of the}} 6 p[3 / 2] 2 level to a rydberg state. This will result in dips in the 823. 2 line. This <b>e-dip</b> spectroscopy is based on the known stark spectrum as function of electric field strength. To study the feasibility a dielectric barrier discharge is used and a very good spatial resolution is not needed. The first part of this paper the experimental set-up will be discussed. Limits of this method and development in the near future are discussed in the second part...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} syntectonic basins, {{generated}} at the hanging-wall of regional low-angle detachments, {{can help to}} gain a better knowledge of these important and mechanically controversial extensional structures, constraining their kinematics and timing of activity. Seismic reflection images constrain the geometry and internal structure of the Sansepolcro Basin (the northernmost portion of the High Tiber Valley). This basin was generated at the hangingwall of the Altotiberina Fault (AtF), an <b>E-dipping</b> low-angle normal fault, active at least since Late Pliocene, affecting the upper crust of this portion of the Northern Apennines. The dataset analysed consists of 5 seismic reflection lines acquired in the 80 s’ by ENI-Agip for oil exploration and a portion of the NVR deep CROP 03 profile. The interpretation of the seismic profiles provides a 3 -D reconstruction of the basin’s shape and of the sedimentary succession infilling the basin. This consisting of up to 1200 m of fluvial and lacustrine sediments: this succession is much thicker and possibly older than previously hypothesised. The seismic data also image the geometry at depth of the faults driving the basin onset and evolution. The western flank is bordered by a set of <b>E-dipping</b> normal faults, producing the uplifting and tilting of Early to Middle Pleistocene succession along the Anghiari ridge. Along the eastern flank, the sediments are markedly dragged along the SW-dipping Sansepolcro fault. Both NE- and SW-dipping faults splay out from the NE-dipping, low-angle Altotiberina fault. Both AtF and its high-angle splays are still active, as suggested by combined geological and geomorphological evidences: the historical seismicity of the area can be reasonably associated to these faults, however the available data do not constrain a unambiguous association between the single structural elements and the major earthquakes...|$|R
40|$|Two crustal-scale {{cross-sections}} of the Mid-Norwegian Atlantic passive margin are discussed. Large W- and <b>E-dipping</b> normal faults {{relate to}} {{extension of the}} continental crust following the Caledonian orogeny and the subsequent opening of the Atlantic Ocean. The passive margin extends from the ocean-continent boundary west of the Vøring Marginal High to the innermost extensional normal faults 90 km west of the Caledonian thrust front. Based on earthquake data and published results of geophysical modelling and seismic interpretation, the average depth to which the normal faults extend in the offshore domain is estimated to 20 ± 5 km. This depth corresponds to the brittle-ductile transition in the crust of the stretched Mid-Norwegian continental margin. Above this transition the crust extended by brittle faulting (tilted blocks); below this limit the crust extended in a ductile manner...|$|R
40|$|Initial SE-dipping slow {{subduction}} of the Ligurian-Tethys lithosphere beneath Africa from Late Cretaceous {{to middle}} Oligocene twisting to a later faster <b>E-dipping</b> subduction of the subcrustal lithosphere is proposed as an efficient geodynamic mechanism to structure the arcuate Betic-Rif orogenic system. This new subduction-related geodynamic scenario {{is supported by}} a kinematic model constrained by well-dated plate reconstructions, tectonic, sedimentary and metamorphic data sets. The slow initial SE-dipping subduction of the Ligurian-Tethys realm beneath the Malaguide upper plate unit is sufficient to subduct Alpujarride and Nevado-Filabride rocks to few tens of kilometers of depth in middle Eocene times. The shift from SE- to <b>E-dipping</b> subduction during latest Oligocene-early Miocene was possibly caused by both the inherited geometry of the highly segmented Ligurian-Tethys domain and by the fast roll-back of the subducted lithospheric slab. The early Miocene rather synchronous multiple crustal and subcrustal processes comprising the collision along the Betic front, the exhumation of the HP/LT metamorphic complexes, the opening of the Alboran basin, its flooring by HP Alpujarride rocks and subsequent HT imprint, {{can be explained by the}} fast NW- and W-directed roll-back of the Ligurian-Tethys subcrustal lithospheric slab. The W retreat of the Ligurian-Tethys lithosphere in middle-late Miocene times could partly explain the initiation of its lateral tear and consequent subcrustal processes. From latest Miocene onward the Betic-Rif system evolved under both the northerly push of Africa resulting in tightening at crustal and subcrustal levels and by the distinct current dynamics of the steep lithospheric slab. The SW-directed scape of the Rif fold belt is one of the most striking evidences linked to the recent evolution of the squeezed Betic-Rif system between Africa and Iberia. Â© 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|International audienceDirect {{absolute}} dating of the Penninic Frontal Thrust tectonic motion is achieved using the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar technique in the Pelvoux Crystalline Massif (Western Alps). The dated phengites were formed syn-kinematically in shear zones. They underline the brittle-ductile stretching lineation, pressure-shadow fibres and slickensides consistent with underthrusting of the European continental slab below the propagating Penninic Thrust. Chlorite–phengite thermobarometry yields 10 – 15 km and T∼ 280 °C, while 40 Ar/ 39 Ar phengite ages mainly range between 34 and 30 Ma, with one younger age at 27 Ma. This Early Oligocene age range matches a major tectonic rearrangement of the Alpine chain. Preservation of prograde 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages is ascribed to passive exhumation of the Pelvoux shear zone network, sandwiched between more external thrusts and the Penninic Front reactivated as an <b>E-dipping</b> detachment fault. Partial resetting in the Low Temperature part of argon spectra below 24 Ma is ascribed to brittle deformation and alteration of phengites...|$|R
40|$|The Gulf of California Extensional Province {{in northeastern}} Baja California {{contains}} a major structural {{transition from a}} northern domain of widely spaced basins and ranges to a southern domain of closely spaced, NNW-striking high-angle faults. In the northern domain, the western boundary of the province (the Main Gulf Escarpment) is a single listric normal fault, the San Pedro Mártir fault; in the southern domain it is a 5 km wide zone of numerous <b>E-dipping</b> high-angle normal faults. The western half of this structural transition, studied here, does not occur by a single ‘transfer fault’ but rather by: (1) transfer of displacement from the San Pedro Mártir fault onto multiple fault zones in the footwall, without intervening cross-faults; and (2) increased southward disruption of the hanging wall by WNW-striking strike-slip faults (oblique to the extension direction) and NNW-striking normal faults and extension fractures. This structural transition involves both the hanging wall and the footwall of the escarpment. The lack of a discrete transfer structure is attributed either to insufficient extension (< 10 %) or to a gradual change in geometry of the basal detachment...|$|R

Mineral de Talca is a rare occurrence of Mesozoic, gold-bearing quartz vein mineralisation situated within the Coastal Range of northern Chile. Quartz veins are controlled by NNW-SSE trending faults are hosted by Devonian-Carboniferous metasediments of greenschist facies, and younger, undeformed granitoid and gabbro intrusions. The principle structural control in the area is the easterly dipping, NNW-SSE trending El Teniente Fault, which most likely developed as an extensional normal fault in the Triassic, but was later reactivated as a strike slip fault during subsequent compression. A dilational zone in the El Teniente Fault appears to have focussed fluid flow and an array of NW-SE-trending veins is present as splays off the El Teniente Fault. Mineralised quartz veins typically up to a metre thick occur in three main orientations: (1) parallel to and within NNW-SSE trending, <b>E-dipping</b> faults throughout the area; (2) along NW-SE trending, NE-dipping structures which may also host andesite dykes; (3) rarer E-W trending, subvertical veins.

40|$|A new dataset for the {{high-pressure}} to ultrahigh-pressure Western Gneiss Region {{allows the}} definition of distinct structural and petrological domains. Much {{of the study area}} is an <b>E-dipping</b> homocline with E-plunging lineations that exposes progressively deeper, more strongly deformed, more eclogite-rich structural levels westward. Although eclogites crop out across the WGR, Scandian deformation is weak and earlier structures are well preserved in the southeastern half of the study area. The Scandian reworking increases westward, culminating in strong Scandian fabrics with only isolated pockets of older structures; the dominant Scandian deformation was coaxial E–W stretching. The sinistrally sheared Møre–Trøndelag Fault Complex and Nordfjord Mylonitic Shear Zone bound these rocks to the north and south. There was moderate top-E, amphibolite-facies deformation associated with translation of the allochthons over the basement along its eastern edge, and the Nordfjord–Sogn Detachment Zone underwent strong lower amphibolite-facies to greenschist-facies top-W shearing. A northwestward increase in exhumation-related melting is indicated by leucosomes with hornblende, plagioclase, and Scandian sphene. In the western 2 / 3 of the study area, exhumation-related, amphibolite-facies symplectite formation in quartzofeldspathic gneiss postdated most Scandian deformation; further deformation was restricted to slip along biotite-rich foliation planes and minor local folding. That the Western Gneiss Region quartzofeldspathic gneiss exhibits a strong gradient in degree of deformation, implies that continental crust in general need not undergo pervasive deformation during subduction...|$|R
40|$|The {{study area}} {{is located in}} the {{northern}} part of the Crotone Basin that represents the wedge-top depozone of the foreland basin system developed on the Ionian side of Calabria. The north-western stratigraphic succession consists of Middle Miocene shallow marine conglomerate of the San Nicola Fm. passing upward into the offshore Ponda Clays (Tortonian), which underlie organic-rich laminites (Tripoli Fm.) at the Tortonian/Messinian boundary. During the Messinian the sedimentation in the area was dominated by evaporitic conditions producing selenite deposits and halite. In the studied area such conditions are recorded only by clastic evaporite deposits, such as limestone breccias, thick gypsrudites and gypsarenites (resedimented evaporites), which overly the pre-Messinian deposits by the basinal correlative conformity of the marginal unconformity (not visible in the study area). An intra-Messinian shortening affected this north-western succession, which now forms a SE-verging anticline and an <b>E-dipping</b> monocline. The anticline is characterized by a low amplitude/axial length and both its geometry and minor faulting suggest a trishear faultpropagation folding kinematics (Hardy and Ford, 1997) with low propagation/slip (P/S ≅ 0) and large ramp angle (about 70 °).

40|$|Oceanic core {{complexes}} at slow-spreading ridges {{represent the}} uplifted footwalls of large-offset 'detachment' faults that initiate at steep dips, and rotate to flatten via a 'rolling hinge' mechanism {{in response to}} flexural unloading. A key question is whether oceanic core complex development is accommodated entirely by displacement on the detachment fault zone, or if significant internal deformation of the footwall occurs during flexure and rotation. We investigate this by constraining the internal architecture of the Atlantis Massif oceanic core complex (Mid-Atlantic Ridge, 30 {degree sign}N) using Formation MicroScanner borehole wall images and cores from the 1416 m-deep Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Hole U 1309 D. Two distinct sets of structures are observed. N-S-striking, <b>E-dipping</b> structures dominating the upper 385 m are interpreted as a brittle to semi-brittle zone of fracturing in the footwall. Structures with this geometry occur down to 750 m below seafloor, suggesting that the detachment damage zone extends deep into the footwall. The nature of this deformation is, however, enigmatic: several cataclastic shear zones with reverse geometry in their current orientations may be rotated extensional faults or relate to shortening {{at the base of}} the flexing beam of a very weak footwall. By contrast, E-W-striking, N- and S-dipping structures dominate the lowermost kilometer of the borehole. They likely represent conjugate fractures formed in the hanging wall of a late, E-W normal fault zone, separating gabbroic rocks of the central dome of Atlantis Massif from serpentinized peridotite to the south, responsible for post-detachment uplift of the southern margin of the massif...|$|R
40|$|Geological and {{geophysical}} {{data have}} been {{integrated with the}} aim of presenting a new evolutionary model for the Southern Tyrrhenian and adjacent regions. The Southern Tyrrhenian backarc basin opened within a plate convergence regime because of sinking and rollback of the oceanic Ionian lithosphere. On the basis of seismological observations, I infer that the sinking slab was torn apart on either side in the last 2 Ma and this process controlled the neotectonics of the Southern Apennines - Tyrrhenian region. On the north-eastern side the slab broke off from NW to SE and this process triggered volcanism and NW-SE extension along the Eastern Tyrrhenian margin, and strike-slip tectonics along NW-SE trending faults in Northern Calabria. On the south-western side the slab broke off from W to E along the Aeolian Island alignment, although the tear has currently been reoriented along the NNW-SSE Malta escarpment. During its sinking the subducted slab also detached from the overriding plate, favouring the wedging of the asthenosphere between the two plates and the regional uplift of the Calabrian arc and surroundings. This regional uplift promoted gravitational instability within the orogenic wedge, particularly towards low topography areas; the large-scale sliding of the Calabrian arc towards the Ionian basin can be the cause of CW rotation and graben formation in Calabria. Also the <b>E-dipping</b> extensional faults of the Southern Apennines can be related to accommodation of vertical motions within the fold-and-thrust belt. The pattern of recent seismicity reflects this neotectonics where crustal-scale gravity deformation within the orogenic wedge is responsible for extensional earthquakes in Calabria and the Southern Apennines, whereas Africa plate convergence can account for compressional earthquakes in Sicily...|$|R
40|$|Late Miocene basaltic sills and dikes in the Paiute Ridge area of {{southern}} nevada show evidence that their emplacement was structurally controlled. Basaltic dikes {{in this area}} formed by dilating pre-existing vertical to steeply <b>E-dipping</b> normal faults. Magma propagation along these faults must have required less energy than {{the creation of a}} self-propagated fracture at dike tips and the magma pressure must have been greater than the compressive stress perpendicular to the fault surface. N- to NE-trending en echelon dikes formed locally and are not obviously attached to the three main dikes in the area. The en echelon segments are probably pieces of deeper dikes, which are segmented perhaps {{as a result of a}} documented rotation of the regional stresses. Alternatively, changes in orientation of principal stresses in the vicinity of each en echelon dike could have resulted from local loads associated with paleotopographic highs or nearby structures. Sills locally branched off some dikes within 300 m of the paleosurface. These subhorizontal bodies occur consistently in the hanging wall block of the dike-injected faults, and intrude Tertiary tuffs near the Paleozoic-Tertiary contact. The authors suggest that the change in stresses near the earth`s surface, the material strength of the tuff and paleozoic rocks, and the Paleozoic bedding dip direction probably controlled the location of sill formation and direction of sill propagation. The two largest sills deflected the overlying tuffs to form lopoliths, indicating that the magma pressure exceeded vertical stresses at that location and that the shallow level and large size of the sills allowed interaction with the free (earth`s) surface. 32 refs., 4 figs., 1 tab...|$|R

The slide debris de-tached from an east-facing slope and left a giant niche, where the geological and morphological conditions point to different types of failure mechanisms. According to the lithologies encountered in the scarp and accumulation area, {{the main source of}} the rapid Köfels rockslide is represented by a several hundred metres thick orthogneiss complex embedded in paragneisses of the Austroal-pine Ötztal basement unit. Layering and foliation of both the orthogneisses and the surrounding paragneisses are orientated unfa-vourable to promote slope failures. Rather this slope collapse was clearly structurally predisposed by fault-related valley-deepening and the coalescence of different brittle fracture systems. The key-discontinuities that reduced here the rock mass strength and en-abled the failure are two main fracture sets: in the orthogneisses, fracture set og# 1 comprises the well-known 25 - 35 ° <b>E-dipping</b> sli-ding planes that daylight subparallel to the slope, set og# 2 forms a cluster of 60 - 80 ° E- to NE-dipping fractures. In the paragneis-ses, the fractures measured show a similar but more scattering spatial distribution. Concerning the slope collapse, the newly com-piled geological map indicates that the size of the southern scarp area, which is entirely made up by paragneiss series, obviously differs from the volume of according lithologies in the accumulation area.

Tectonic analysis of the profiles, together with {{a review of the}} existing literature allows for proposing the following multistage evolution of the arc of the Western Alps: (1) exhumation of the mantle beneath the Ivrea Zone to shallow crustal depths during Mesozoic is a prerequisite for the formation of a strong Ivrea mantle wedge whose strength exceeds that of surrounding mostly quartz-bearing units, and consequently allows for indentation of the Ivrea mantle wedge and eastward back-thrusting of the western Alps during Alpine orogeny. (2) A first early stage (pre- 35 Ma) of the West-Alpine orogenic evolution is characterized by top-NNW thrusting in sinistral transpression causing at least some 260 km displacement of internal Western Alps and E-W-striking Alps farther east, together with the Adria micro-plate, towards N to NNW with respect to stable Europe. (3) The second stage (35 – 25 Ma), further accentuating the arc, is associated with top-WNW thrusting in the external zones of the central portion of the arc and is related to the lateral indentation of the Ivrea mantle slice towards WNW by some 100 – 150 km. (4) The final stage of arc formation (25 – 0 Ma) is associated with orogeny in the Apennines leading to oroclinal bending in the southernmost Western Alps in connection with the 50 counterclockwise rotation of the Corsica-Sardinia block and the Ligurian Alps.

40|$|Five large {{earthquakes}} shook southern Calabria in February–March 1783. We {{focused on}} the first shock (Me 6. 9), which occurred on 5 February in the Gioia Tauro Plain. Most investigators attribute the event to aW-dipping, highangle fault running {{at the base of}} the Aspromonte crystalline bedrock on the ESE side of the Plain (Aspromonte Fault). Other workers contend that the earthquake was generated by an <b>E-dipping,</b> low-angle blind fault (Gioia Tauro Fault) similar to the adjacent Messina Straits Fault. In 1999 – 2000 we carried out four geochemical surveys in the Gioia Tauro Plain with the aim of contributing to this debate with an independent line of evidence. We sampled 240 groundwater sites and measured a suite of in-situ physical and chemical parameters. Our goal was to gain new insight into the seismogenic source by identifying geochemical anomalies associated with the deepening of the hydrological circuits due to the presence of enhanced faulting/fracturing. The deep-fluid signatures are mainly represented by temperature, salinity, total carbon and radon anomalies. We identified three zones of dominant deep fluid discharge: the Nicotera-Galatro area (along the Nicotera-Galatro portion of theNW-trending Nicotera-Gioiosa Jonica lineament), a small NW-SE trending area between Gioia Tauro and Seminara, and the coastline between Rosarno and Palmi. This latter sector locates just above the upper edge of the hypothesised Gioia Tauro Fault. Most of the geochemical anomalies are recorded around Rosarno, at the intersection between the Gioia Tauro Fault and the Nicotera-Gioiosa Jonica lineament. In contrast, no evidence of groundwater deepening and active fracturing was found along the Aspromonte Fault.

40|$|Many rifts {{develop in}} {{response}} to multiphase extension with numerical and physical models suggesting that reactivation of first-phase normal faults and rift-related variations in bulk crustal rheology control the evolution and final geometry of subsequent rifts. However, many natural multiphase rifts are deeply buried and thus poorly exposed {{in the field and}} poorly imaged in seismic reflection data, making it difficult to test these models. Here we integrate recent 3 D seismic reflection and borehole data across the entire East Shetland Basin, northern North Sea, to constrain the long-term, regional development of this multiphase rift. We document the following key stages of basin development: (i) pre-Triassic to earliest Triassic development of multiple sub-basins controlled by widely distributed, NNW- to NE-trending, east- and west-dipping faults; (ii) Triassic activity on a single major, NE-trending, west-dipping fault located near the basins western margin, and formation of a large half-graben; and (iii) Jurassic development of a large, <b>E-dipping,</b> N- to NE-trending half-graben near the eastern margin of the basin, which was associated with rift narrowing and strain focusing in the Viking Graben. In contrast to previous studies, which argue for two discrete periods of rifting during the Permian–Triassic and Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous, we find that rifting in the East Shetland Basin was protracted from pre-Triassic to Cretaceous. We find that, during the Jurassic, most pre-Jurassic normal faults were buried and in some cases cross-cut by newly formed faults, with only a few being reactivated. Previously developed faults thus had only a limited control on the evolution and geometry of the later rift. We instead argue that strain migration and rift narrowing was linked to the evolving thermal state of the lithosphere, an interpretation supporting the predictions of lithosphere-scale numerical models. Our study indicates that additional regional studies of natural rifts are required to test and refine the predictions of physical and numerical models, more specifically, our study suggests models not explicitly recognising or including thermal or rheological effects might over emphasise the role of discrete pre-existing rift structures such as normal faults...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{interpretation}} of high-resolution and industry multichannel seismic reflection profiles and lithostratigraphy from onshore wells {{reveals that the}} Miocene to Recent tectonic evolution of the western Antalya Basin occurred in three distinct intervals: the pre-Messinian Miocene, the Messinian, and the Pliocene-Quaternary. During the pre-Messinian Miocene, a prominent east-west striking fold-thrust belt developed across the region. Today, this belt is characterized by NW-SE striking, SW-verging thrust panels {{in the east and}} broadly N-S striking, W-verging thrust panels in the west. The belt became buckled during the late Miocene assuming its current configuration as an inverted V-shaped structure within the marine western Antalya Basin. The Miocene fold-thrust belt mapped in the marine areas is readily correlated with the onland Isparta Angle. The Messinian interval was tectonically quiet and marked by the deposition of a thick evaporite succession within the deep Antalya Basin. The Pliocene-Quaternary interval marked a major change in tectonic style, where strain is partitioned into discrete regional morpho-tectonic domains. In the east, the Miocene fold-thrust belt remained largely inactive; however, several prominent thrusts became re-activated during this time. Mapping showed that these three thrusts can be traced toward the southeast in the deep Antalya Basin and readily correlated with the Ovgos, Kythrea and Orga thrusts mapped onland Cyprus. The shallower slope and shelf in this area are characterized by broadly actuate and NW-SE striking and SE- and NW-dipping extensional faults with strike slip components. In the west portion of the Antalya Basin, the structural framework was dominated by a series of broadly N-S striking, invariably steeply <b>E-dipping</b> extensional faults which form a 20 - 30 km wide zone of deformation. This zone occurs over the very steep continental slope in western Antalya Basin, and extends westward into the Kemer Peninsula and the Beydağları region.

40|$|The Øygarden Complex and the Bergen Arc System are {{intriguing}} large-scale {{structures in}} the SW Norwegian Caledonides, but their formation is still incompletely understood. So far, the lack of published U-Pb zircon ages has limited clear interpretations of the geologic evolution of the Øygarden Complex. The Lyderhorn Gneiss {{is located in the}} poorly studied eastern part of the Øygarden Complex and forms the core of the Bergen Arc. Detailed field mapping was conducted and seven samples were dated by SIMS U-Pb zircon geochronology, to study the magmatic and structural formation of the Lyderhorn Gneiss. Igneous protoliths formed during the Mesoproterozoic Gothian-Telemarkian (1504 Ma) and Sveconorwegian (1041 Ma and 1026 - 1022 Ma) orogenic periods. They do not record Sveconorwegian high-grade regional metamorphism. Early Ordovician (483 Ma) thermal resetting of metamict zircons was followed by sustained residence at elevated temperatures that annealed previous radiation damage. The U-Pb zircon system was not affected by Caledonian amphibolite facies metamorphism. The structure of the Lyderhorn Gneiss formed in one single deformation event, recorded in ENE-directed exhumational deformation from amphibolite facies to the brittle-plastic transition. Fluid-assisted strain weakening formed phyllonitic <b>E-dipping</b> detachment shear zones that became finally overprinted by (semi-) brittle deformation. Based on the Mesoproterozoic protolith ages, the Lyderhorn Gneiss and thereby the Øygarden Complex are correlated with the Telemarkia domain of the Baltican basement. The age of magmatism relates the Øygarden Complex with the Sirdal Magmatic Belt of southern Norway. The correlation suggests a continuous NNW-trend of Sveconorwegian domain boundaries and supports the assertion that Sveconorwegian high-T metamorphism in the Baltican basement was rather local than regional. A rapid temperature increase in the Early Ordovician is interpreted to mark the onset of Caledonian convergence. The structure of the Lyderhorn Gneiss is constrained to have formed by Early Devonian extensional deformation. Bidirectional Devonian extension in the Øygarden Complex is explained by exhumation as a Devonian extensional gneiss dome. The proposed, symmetrical core complex style of exhumation, resembles previously identified core complexes in central Norway and allows for a more consistent interpretation of basement culminations along the Norwegian margin. Possible onshore-offshore correlations are suggested for the Utsira High in the northern North Sea. Detailed structural and thermochronological studies will be needed to test the proposed model...|$|R
40|$|The {{area between}} the Golo and Tavignano valleys (Central Corsica) {{provides}} {{a good opportunity to}} study the relationships between the Hercynian Corsica, the Corte Slices (i. e. Lower Units) and the Schistes Lustrés Complex (Di Rosa et al., 2017). The Hercynian Corsica consists of a paleozoic basement (Roches Brunes Fm. intruded by Permo-Carboniferous monzogranites) covered by Mesozoic and Tertiary sedimentary successions. Despite the occurrence of several shear zones of Tertiary age, the Hercynian Corsica is considered a domain not involved in the Alpine Orogeny. The Corte Slices and the Schistes Lustrés Complex, that belong to the Alpine Corsica, are the remains of the oceanic crust and the European continental margin, both involved in the <b>E-dipping</b> oceanic and continental subduction (Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary). The subduction was associated by an exhumation whose end is regarded as pre-Burdigalian in age (Malasoma & Marroni 2007). In the study area the Schistes Lustrés Complex is represented by metaserpentinites, metagabbros, metabasalts and calc-schists, whereas the Corte Slices consist of three tectonic units similar in their lithostratigraphy (i. e. Paleozoic basement covered by Mesozoic to Tertiary metasediments) but different in the metamorphic degree. The structural setting of the Alpine Units is characterized by a polyphased deformation history: within the Corte Slices, three phases are recognized at all the scale of observation (D 1 -D 3). The D 1 produces F 1 sheath folds and a S 1 foliation, almost completely transposed by the D 2 phase, characterized by F 2 isoclinal folds with a subvertical axial plane foliation, a S 2 and a L 2 stretching lineation. The D 3 is associated to F 3 folds with a subhorizontal axial plane foliation. A post-D 3 brittle deformation phase is associated to the Central Corsica Shear Zone, a strike-slip faults system that cuts all the previous structures. The Schistes Lustrès Complex shows a higher grade of deformation, acquired within the accretionary wedge during the oceanic subduction. However, the Schistes Lustrès Complex is folded by the same structures of the D 3 phase recognized in the Corte Slices, that deform the previous phases within the Schistes Lustrés Complex as well as the tectonic contacts between it and the continental units. The occurrence of the Schistes Lustrés Complex as slices sandwiched between the Corte Slices, suggests an interaction between these two groups during the coupling of the continental units, i. e. in a pre-D 3 phase...|$|R
40|$|The Caledonian Orogen in East Greenland {{comprises}} an autochthonous {{basement complex}} overlain by a Late Proterozoic to Early Proterozoic cover sequence with a regionally extensive thrust sheet complex on top. The thrust sheet complex is further {{divided into three}} separate thrust sheets: (1) allochthonous basement comprises Early- and Meso-Proterozoic ortho- and paragneisses that are reworked at variable intensity during the Caledonian orogeny. Allochthonous basement is overlain by a (2) Mesoproterozoic supracrustal sequence comprising the Krummedal/Smallefjord Sequence. (3) The Neoproterozoic Eleonore Bay Supergroup (EBSGp) overlies the Mesoproterozoic Krummedal/Smallefjord Sequence and represents the upper of the three thrust sheets. An extensional N-striking and top-to-the-E dipping high strain zone {{at the base of}} the Krummedal/Smallefjord Sequence is well documented in the Central Fjord Region in NE Greenland. A similar zone was observed to separate allochthonous basement and the Mesoproterozoic Krummedal/Smallefjord Sequence in the Ardencaple Fjord Area, where the three overriding thrust sheets are present in a NW-SE trending synform. A study of the structural geology and metamorphic petrology of the Ardencaple Fjord area was undertaken, in order to decipher the kinematic evolution. Foliated and lineated <b>E-dipping</b> tonalitic gneisses cross-cut by granitic dike swarms make up the allochthonous basement. The lower part of the overlying Smallefjord Sequence is defined by the Slamsø Shear Zone, a number of N-striking and top-to-the-E dipping ductile and brittle extensional shear zones. Granitic veins are not present in this part of the Smallefjord Sequence, as opposed to its middle- and upper-part. We have found no evidence that the granites emplaced in the Smallefjord Sequence are related to top-to-the-E shear, as proposed by some authors. The nature of the contact separating the Smallefjord Sequence and the EBSGp is overprinted by an undeformed granitic pluton, and thus remains unclear. Some authors have proposed that this contact is an extensional top-to-the-E high strain zone. If this is correct, this high strain zone must predate granite emplacement at ~ 428 Ma. P-T estimates on rocks from allochthonous basement and the base of the Smallefjord Sequence show a clockwise path, which documents extensional movement along the Slamsø Shear Zone. Minimum displacement along this shear zone is 15 - 20 km. The allochthonous basement was exhumed from upper granulite facies at peak metamorphic conditions to amphibolite facies at post peak metamorphic conditions. The Smallefjord was at amphibolite conditions at both peak- and post peak-metamorphic conditions...|$|R
40|$|The Blackrock Canyon {{area in the}} {{southern}} White Pine Range, Nevada mostly consists of the highly extended upper plate of a low-angle normal fault, the Blackrock fault. The post- 31. 3 Ma Blackrock fault places upper Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and overlying Tertiary volcanic rocks of the Garret Ranch Group in its hangingwall against a 50 degrees <b>E-dipping</b> homocline of Cambrian through Mississippian rocks in its footwall. The 15 to 30 degrees W-dipping Blackrock fault is non-planar and consists of two fault segments and a pronounced corrugation, the Bull Spring corrugation. These geometric irregularities suggest the slip direction on the fault was east-southeast or west-northwest. Additional geometric data such as dips of footwall strata and bedding-to-fault angles constrain the slip direction to west-northwest. This movement of the upper plate over the irregular Blackrock fault resulted in non-conservative deformation within the hanging wall block. Blackrock upper plate faults with diverse attitudes are approximately synchronous and orthorhombically symmetrical. Classical Andersonian conjugate faulting theory, which employs two-dimensional (plane) strain cannot explain these geometric and temporal fault relationships. Rather, {{these data suggest that}} non-conjugate processes generated these faults and that they represent three-dimensional or non-plane strain. A kinematic model, which invokes movement of the hangingwall block over a geometrically irregular detachment, explains the non-conservative, three-dimensional deformation observed in the Blackrock upper plate. In the Blackrock upper plate, Blackrock-related faults cut and Tertiary volcanic rocks cover Mesozoic contractile structures. Restored and retrodeformable cross sections allow the reconstruction of the pre-extensional structures. They indicate that normal movement on the Blackrock fault tectonically denuded and disrupted Mesozoic folds and a previously unrecognized thrust fault, which is here named the White Pine thrust. A restored and retrodeformable cross section across the Pancake Range, Duckwater Hills, and the White Pine Range reveals large-scale folds and thrust faults {{that are part of the}} central Nevada thrust belt. These structures correlate with previously reported folds and thrust faults that crop out in surrounding areas and consist of the Pancake thrust, McClure Spring syncline, Duckwater thrust, and the Easy Ridge or Green Springs thrust (Pipkin, 1956; Humphrey, 1960; Nolan and others, 1974; Perry and Dixon, 1993; Carpenter and others, 1993). This regional step-wise balanced and restored cross section, for the first time, allows (1) documentation of central Nevada thrust belt geometry across northern Railroad Valley and (2) examination of Tertiary extensional structural styles and the distribution of extension across this pan of the belt. Together these findings suggest that northern Railroad Valley is an excellent petroleum prospect...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThree {{boreholes}} {{have been}} drilled at 5 -km depth within the fractured granite of the Soultz-sous-Forêts geothermal site (France). A five-month circulation test, joint with a tracer test, {{have been performed}} in 2005 between the injection well GPK 3 and the production wells GPK 2 and GPK 4. After an analysis by a method of dispersive transfer model of the experimental breakthrough curves (BTC), three main circulation loops within the heat exchanger have been obtained. The aim of our work {{is to build a}} flow model of the Soultzsous- Forêts fractured reservoir, based on a realistic fracture network from a hydraulic point of view and consistent with the knowledge of the regional tectonic history. In this paper, the first stages of this model are presented. The proposed conceptual fracture model is based on five main fracture sets that constitute the reservoir in itself, and on some deterministic fault zones that condition the access from the well to the statistical fracture network to the three open holes. On the basis of fracture data collected from well imagery, new fracture density distributions based on Fisher distribution have been calculated. Four main fracture sets corresponding to main statistical modes are individualised: two ~N-S striking sets respectively W-dipping and Edipping; and two NE-SW and NW-SE striking sets respectively NW-dipping and SW-dipping. Those four main sets are consistent with the strain history. Indeed, two ~N-S striking sets respectively W-dipping and <b>E-dipping</b> are widely observed in the Rhine Graben and are commonly interpreted as the result of Oligocene deformation, but could also be related to lower Carboniferous to Permian NNE-SSW sinistral faulting. In addition, the two NE-SW and NW-SE striking sets are consistent with the orientation of the Hercynian structures observed regionally. A fifth fracture set is introduced in order to incorporate the “background noise”. Following this, a Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) model has been built. The rock matrix is considered as impermeable, and the fluid flow takes place only within the fractures. Tracer transport is solved by the particle tracking method. At this stage of progress, the fracture model tends to reproduce the GPK 2 breakthrough curve obtained during the medium-term circulation test performed between the three wells. The GPK 2 breakthrough peak is mainly due to the two ~N-S striking sets which constitute the shortest paths between GPK 3 and GPK 2 while its tail is rather due to the two other main fracture sets, NE-SW and NW-SE striking which create longer paths between GPK 3 and GPK 2 than the two ~N-S striking sets. However, it seems impossible to define a unique homogeneous statistical fracture model leading to a simultaneous fit of the two wells GPK 2 and GPK 4. The work in progress lets assume that a regional evolution of the basic pattern could be a solution. At this stage, it appears that the NE-SW and NW-SE striking sets could play a role more important between GPK 3 and GPK 4 than between GPK 3 and GPK 2...|$|R
40|$|On April 26, 1917 at 9 : 35 : 59 (GMT) an {{earthquake}} {{occurred in the}} Sansepolcro Basin (the northernmost portion of the High Tiber Valley - Italy) producing large damages and fatalities. This event, noted as Monterchi earthquake, is well constrained in the Catalogue of Strong Italian Earthquakes (Boschi et al., 2000) by 134 felt reports locations, mainly distributed {{on the right side}} of the Tiber Valley, mostly affecting the towns of Monterchi, Citerna and surrounding localities. The maximum and epicentral intensity was determined as Io=IX-X degree of the MCS scale corresponding to an equivalent magnitude of Me= 6 that define this event as the most important of the region. The Sansepolcro Basin was generated on the hanging-wall of the Altotiberina Fault (ATF) system. The ATF system is composed by an <b>E-dipping</b> low-angle normal fault, active at least since the Late Pliocene, that represents one of the main regional detachments of the Northern Apennines, and its antithetic W-dipping high-angle normal faults (Barchi, et al., 2009, Boncio et al., 2000). Although the southern part of the ATF was demonstrated to creep (Piccinini et al., 2003), its capability to generate strong or moderate earthquakes is still debated and the historical seismicity that affected the region was not associated to specific geologic sources. For these reasons the study of the Monterchi earthquake plays an important role in the debate. On this light, many authors tried to define the main seismic source parameters through the analysis of historical seismograms and respective bulletins. Preliminary results were presented at previous ECEES, ESC and EGU congresses (Caciagli et al., 2006, Ciaccio et al., 2008, Bernardi et al., 2009). In all these works the hypocentre of the Monterchi earthquake has been substantially unresolved, because of the absolute P and S-phases use, and, for this reason, its epicentre was located 20 km North of the macroseismic one. Concerning the focal mechanism, Bernardi et al. (2009) proposed a moment tensor solution for the Monterchi event, based on almost horizontal recordings from 4 stations situated in a very small azimuthal range. Independently of the validity of the normal fault mechanism proposed by Bernardi et al (2009) their conclusions fit perfectly in the context of the seismotectonic setting of the ATF, but do not account for the discrepancy between the instrumental and the macroseismic epicentres. Today, 49 seismograms from 19 different Euro-Mediterranean observatories are available in the database of the SISMOS Project – INGV ([URL] The BAAS (British Association for Advancement of Sciences) bulletin of 1917, although if incomplete because of the 1 st World War, reports a list of 21 seismological observatories that recorded the P and S-phases for this earthquake. Additionally to this database, we included additional arrival-times deriving from further seismic bulletins not contained in the BAAS reports and from directly digitizing original historical seismograms. An incisive approach to analyse these different data allows us to obtain a new, robust and consistent hypocentral solution, coherent with the macroseismic data, in particular by using S-P travel time differences for recordings where the absolute timing is uncertain. An accurate research on the technical characteristics of the recording historical seismometers (period, damping, gain etc), including the analysis of the instrumental natural period recorded in some seismograms, allows to deconvolute the original digitized seismic traces in order to evaluate the potential of moment tensor inversion, to determine the main seismic parameters (Mo, Mw, Circular Fault Radius), and to implement the solution in the framework of the regional tectonic setting...|$|R
40|$|The House Mountain gneiss {{complex is}} a ~ 100 km 2 {{exposure}} of middle to upper amphibolite facies ortho- and paragneisses within the Atlanta lobe of the Idaho Batholith, south central Idaho. The complex comprises a paragneiss suite juxtaposed between and intruded by a tonalitic gneiss (structurally above) and a granitic gneisses (structurally below). The entire complex contains a pervasive NW-striking, <b>E-dipping</b> foliation, and is intruded by deformed concordant and nondeformed discordant granitic pegmatite sills and dikes, and nondeformed granite of the Idaho Batholith. As {{remnants of the}} pre-batholith crust, these gneisses provide rare and valuable insights into the pre-Cretaceous geologic history of the region. U/Pb zircon data for six lithologies within this gneiss complex illustrate a tectonomagmatic evolution spanning the Neoproterozoic to Latest Cretaceous. Single zircons from the granitic Lower Orthogneiss, imaged with cathodoluminescence to reveal magmatic growth zones and probable metamorphic rims, define a chord with an upper intercept of 726 ± 5 Ma (igneous crystallization) and lower intercept of 82 ± 15 Ma (age of younger metamorphic recrystallization and overgrowth). These data confirm the presence of Precambrian crust in southwestern Idaho, specifically within {{the region of the}} central Atlanta lobe. Detrital zircons extracted from a quartzite unit within the paragneiss sequence yielded ages ranging from 2948 to 587 Ma. However, the 587 Ma age for the youngest grain is suspected of being the result of mixing between two domains within the grain, one very young and one older than 726 Ma. Both the Lower Orthogneiss and the paragneiss sequence are likely related to the rifting of the supercontinent Rodinia. Based on lithological similarities and approximate age synchrony, correlations can be drawn between the paragneiss sequence and the Windermere Supergroup of central Idaho, specifically the Gospel peaks sequence A of Lund (2003). Zircons from the tonalitic Upper Orthogneiss, displaying simple oscillatory zoning in CL, yield an igneous crystallization age of ca. 157 Ma, potentially linking Late Jurassic plutonism in Northern Nevada and the Sierra Nevada Batholith with NW Idaho. Multifaceted, low-U zircons, most likely of metamorphic origin, from an ~ 10 m thick amphibolite sill within the paragneiss stack give concordant ages of ca. 122 to 125 Ma. These ages are interpreted as a first constraint on the age of amphibolite-facies metamorphism of the House Mountain gneisses. Petrography reveals that penetrative deformation was synchronous with and outlasted peak metamorphism. Four zircons from one of the many deformed P 1 pegmatite sills within the Lower Orthogneiss define an intrusive age of 82 Ma. This age coincides with the age of magmatic overgrowth recorded in the Lower Orthogneiss zircons and, due to the geometry of the sills, provides a date for at least a portion of the kinematic history of the gneisses. The P 1 pegmatites are inferred as being related to the early stages of Idaho Batholith magmatism. The fifth sample analyzed is one of numerous nondeformed P 2 pegmatitic dikes intruding the Lower Orthogneiss. Zircons from this sample produce near concordant crystallization ages of ca. 66 Ma, and help to constrain the end of kinematic deformation in the gneisses. The P 2 pegmatites are inferred as being related to decompressional melting following the initiation of exhumation of the House Mountain area, which was completed {{by the time of the}} Eocene Challis Volcanic event...|$|R
40|$|Mineral de Talca {{is a rare}} {{occurrence}} of Mesozoic, gold-bearing quartz vein mineralisation situated within the Coastal Range of northern Chile. Quartz veins controlled by NNW–SSE-trending faults are hosted by Devonian-Carboniferous metasediments of greenschist facies and younger, undeformed granitoid and gabbro intrusions. The principal structural control in the area is the easterly dipping, NNW–SSE-trending El Teniente Fault, which most likely developed as an extensional normal fault in the Triassic but was later reactivated as a strike-slip fault during subsequent compression. A dilational zone in the El Teniente Fault appears to have focussed fluid flow, {{and an array of}} NW–SE-trending veins is present as splays off the El Teniente Fault. Mineralised quartz veins typically up to a metre thick occur in three main orientations: (1) parallel to and within NNW–SSE-trending, <b>E-dipping</b> faults throughout the area; (2) along NW–SE-trending, NE-dipping structures which may also host andesite dykes; and (3) rarer E–W-trending, subvertical veins. All mineralised quartz veins show evidence of multiple fluid events with anastomosing and crosscutting veins and veinlets, some of which contain up to 3. 5 vol. % base metal sulphides. Mineralogically, Au is present in three textural occurrences, identified by 3 D CT scanning: (1) with arsenopyrite and pyrite in altered wall rock and along the margins of some of the veins; (2) with Cu-Pb-Zn sulphides within quartz veins; and (3) as nuggets and clusters of native Au within quartz. Fluid inclusion work indicates the presence of CO 2 –CH 4 -bearing fluids with homogenisation temperatures of ∼ 350 °C and aqueous fluids with low-moderate salinities (0. 4 – 15. 5 wt% NaCl eq.) with homogenisation temperatures in the range of 161 – 321 °C. The presence of Au with arsenopyrite and pyrite in structurally controlled quartz veins and in greenschist facies rocks with evidence of CO 2 -bearing fluids is consistent with an orogenic style classification for the mineralisation. However, the significant amounts of base metals and the moderate salinity of some of the fluids and the proximity to felsic granitoid intrusions have raised the possibility of an intrusion-related origin for the mineralisation. Vein sulphides display S isotope signatures (δ 34 S + 2. 1 to + 4. 3 [*]‰) that are intermediate between the host rock metasediments (δ 34 S + 5. 3 to + 7. 5 [*]‰) and the local granitoids (δ 34 S + 1. 3 to + 1. 4 [*]‰), indicating a distinct crustal source of some of the S in the veins and possibly a mixed magmatic-crustal S source. The local granite and granodiorite give U-Pb zircon ages of 219. 6 [*]±[*] 1 and 221. 3 [*]±[*] 2. 8 Ma, respectively. Lead isotopic compositions of galena in the veins are consistent, suggesting derivation from a homogeneous source. Differences, however, between the isotopic signatures of the veins and igneous feldspars from nearby intrusions imply that these bodies were not the source of the metals though an igneous source from depth cannot be discounted. The Triassic age of the granitoids is consistent with emplacement during regional crustal extension, with the El Teniente Fault formed as an easterly dipping normal fault. The change to a compressional regime in the mid-Jurassic caused reactivation of the El Teniente Fault as a strike-slip fault and provided a structural setting suitable for orogenic style mineralisation. The intrusions may, however, have provided a structural competency contrast that focused the mineralising fluids in a dilational jog along the El Teniente Fault to form WNW-trending veins. As such, the mineralisation is classified as orogenic style, and the identification of the key mineralogical, isotopic and structural features has implications for exploration and the development of similar deposits along the Coastal Range...|$|R
40|$|The Koulekoun Gold {{project is}} the most {{important}} prospect of Avocet Mining plc. It is one of the projects within the TriK-block in Guinea (West Africa) for which an exploration permit has been granted. The Koulekoun deposit is located within the Siguiri basin of Birimian age in the Eastern Guinea region; where most Guinea’s gold mines are situated. The present study involves the investigation of structural elements (S₀, S₁, S₂, intrusive contacts, faults and veins) from selected drill cores from drill sections that intersect the Koulekoun orebody in four parts of the deposit; characterizes the principal orientations of measured structures and determines their relationships using stereonet; in order to predict important intersections to focus on in exploration programs within the TriK-block and suggests a possible structural model of the Koulekoun deposit. Raw data used for the present research was collected from half-core samples due to the absence of surface outcrop from which direct measurements could have been made. Measured data were interpreted using stereographic projection. Often no preferred orientations of structural elements exist in the area, suggesting a complex structural situation, particularly with regard to hydrothermal vein attitudes. Thus, it has been illustrated from structural data analysis and S₀ data 3 d interpolation of the four sub-structural domains (North-East, North-West, Central and South) that NE-SW structures (S₂, intrusive contact, fault and vein) have controlled the occurrency of gold mineralization in the Koulekoun deposit area. Geometrical relationships between structure main cluster orientation from stereonet analysis show the majority of S₀ moderately E-dipping; intrusive contacts dip at moderate angle to the SE in all zones, except in the North-East zone where they are sub-vertical and SE-dipping. Fault planes show variable orientation of NE-SW, NW-SE and E-W, and steeply SE-dipping. Vein planes correspond to fault systems and show high variability in their orientation with numerous orders of vein direction in each domain. The cross-cutting relationships suggest two principal generations of faults: the NE-SW fault (F 1) and the NW-SE fault (F 2). These two fault systems and their associated vein intersection areas preferably define the ore shoot zones within the Koulekoun deposit. The proposed structural model of the Koulekoun deposit suggests the intersection and interference of major NW-SE and minor NE-SW structures. The interference of folds formed basin-dome structures with oval shape geometries striking NW-SE and that dominantly occur in North-East, North-West and Central zones. The South Zone is characterized by NE-SW gently plunging and moderately inclined folds with NW-SE striking axial surface. Gold mineralization occurs at the edges of basin-dome structures in North-East, North-West and Central zones. Mineralized porphyry intrusions are likely located within the axial surface of the South zone folds and extend toward the Central zone. The proposed model is compliant with the earlier model of the Koulekoun deposit presented by Tenova (2013); Fahey et al. (2013) describing the Koulekoun deposit as an auriferous NE-SW trending fault zone, intersecting a major NW-striking and steeply <b>E-dipping</b> porphyry units. The model also fits within the regional structural context suggested by Lahondere et al. (1999 a) related to the E-W vein structures attributed to NW-SE fractures and to the conjugated fault of NE-SW direction. Comparatively to the three industrial gold deposits (Siguiri, Lero, Kiniero) being currently mined in the Siguiri Basin, and defined as mesothermal vein and lode mineralization hosted in Birimian meta-sedimentary rocks (Lalande, 2005), the Koulekoun gold deposit appears to be a porphyry hosted orogenic disseminated style mineralization system (Fahey et al., 2013). Although, similarities between the Koulekoun gold deposit and these three industrial deposits (Siguiri, Lero, Kiniero) constitute of the intensive extends of the weathering profile and at some stages, by the existence of numerous ring-shaped and curved lineaments enhanced by drag folding (Lero deposit for instance). It is therefore recommended that targets selection around the Koulekoun deposit and within the TriK-block for further exploration programs be concentrated along NW-SE structures, in objective to determine possible intersection zones with NE-SW structures...|$|R
40|$|The brittle and brittle-ductile {{fault and}} shear zone {{patterns}} are investigated in the Oligo-Miocene intrusions of the Bergell and Insubric {{regions in the}} Eastern Central Alps. In the study area, the late deformation pattern encompasses, from the regional scale up to the microtectonic scale, normal, oblique-slip and strike-slip faults. Much lesser reverse faults occur only at the microtectonic scale. The tectonic regime associated with these faults is distributed {{in space and time}} into extensional and transcurrent displacements. Fault data from 120 measurements stations, which altogether represent ca. 3500 fault planes, have been collected in this study. The fault-slip data analysis of the minor fault populations is coherent for both the extensive and strike-slip tectonic regimes and yields a very consistent ENE-WSW directed orientation of the extension axis, i. e. parallel to the Alpine belt direction. Widespread normal faulting is a major event which led to orogen-parallel extension. This extension is materialized by a dominant set of NW-SE striking (transversal) normal faults. A minor part of this extensional deformation is also accommodated by oblique-normal slip on sets of E-W striking (longitudinal) faults. Amongst the former ones, the Forcola fault is a major late Alpine normal fault located at the contact between the middle and upper Penninic units. The brittle-ductile fault consists of mylonites and cataclasites accommodating early Miocene NE-SW extension at the eastern border of the Lepontine dome. This <b>E-dipping</b> extensional structure is a prominent regional structure that: (1) relatively displaces the wall rocks by a significant vertical minimum amount of approximately 3000 m. The fault is proposed to be a conjugate fault with respect to the extensional Simplon fault system in the western Central Alps. (2) promoted the space available for emplacement of the 25 Ma old Novate leucogranite. The extensional deformation within the syn-tectonic intrusion is heterogeneous and characterized by conjugated shear zones surrounding lens-shaped domains of weakly deformed granite. These structures developed during fast cooling of the intrusion. This first evidence for orogen-parallel syn-extensional leucogranite emplacement during Oligocene convergence in the Alps brings new insights into the lower timing activity of the Forcola fault. Conversely, new zircon and apatite fission track ages across the Forcola fault give an upper age limit (Langhian) for the cessation of significant vertical movement on the fault. Regarding the Tonale fault, the available fission track data suggest the likelihood of vertical displacements and block rotation along the fault from the Middle Miocene onwards. The strike-slip shearing event commonly but non systematically over imposed on the earlier extensional structures. The transcurrent paleostress field is calculated from conjugated sets of strike-slip faults that define triangular wedges associated with an orogen-parallel orientation of the extension axis. The transcurrent displacements are materialized by: (1) right-lateral slip along reactivated and/or neoformed longitudinal faults and reactivated transversal faults (2) left-lateral slip along N-S to NE-SW oriented faults. On the basis of these observations, the following Neogene tectonic evolution of the Alpine collision belt in the Eastern Central Alps is proposed. In response to the northwestward motion and anticlockwise rotation of the Apulian microplate, the internal domain of the belt in the Bergell region reacted by E-directed lateral extrusion by the late Oligocene onwards. This lateral escape was typically accommodated by a combination of normal and transcurrent displacements. The onset of orogen-parallel extension at the Forcola fault is kinematically and temporally compatible with the late Oligocene dextral slip at the E-W oriented Tonale Line and sinistral strike-slip at the NE-SW oriented Engadine Line. These prominent shear zones define a regional first order tectonic block that accommodated the E-directed extrusion of the Bergell area. Within the extruding block, the tectonic regime evolved from a major extensive to transtensive tectonic regime to a more transcurrent one. Because of strong lateral confinement due to indentation along the Giudicarie-Pustertal indenter {{at the end of the}} Burdigalian, orogen-parallel extension and lateral escape loosed efficiency. With on-going convergence, lateral extrusion was then primarily relocated sideways in the Western and Eastern Alps by the early Miocene onwards, according to free boundary availabilities...|$|R
40|$|Remote sensing {{has become}} an {{essential}} tool to improve data collection and spatial analysis in the geosciences. Identification of passive margin structures that are exposed along the Egyptian coast of the Red Sea, and their control on landforms has been hampered by limited data resolution and restricted access to this arid and inaccessible region. A major challenge lies in distinguishing features in the landscape that formed due to long-term tectonic activity and erosion from those features that modified the landscape recently. The goals of this thesis were to determine to what degree the study area is currently tectonically active, and what major hazards might affect the touristically developing coastal region. This study deals with the structural and geomorphological evolution of the rift-related structures {{and their impact on}} the sediment distribution and landforms variation in the northern Quseir area. In such a remote desert area, field and remote morphostructural analysis are needed to understand the structural and geomorphological evolution. The current study is mainly based on high-resolution QuickBird image analysis and field investigation. Field mapping was limited to one season, owing to acute safety concerns in the Eastern Desert. In the study area, the pre-rift stratigraphy includes Pan-African basement rocks overlain by pre-rift clastic and carbonate successions that range in age from Cambrian to Eocene. Syn-rift clastic and carbonate rocks range in age from Late Oligocene to recent and show depositional patterns controlled by fault systems. The field area exposes a section of a tectonically uplifted, amagmatic sedimentary sequence, which formed due to passive-margin-related rifting of the Red Sea: the Mesozoic and Tertiary sedimentary units that fill the 7 -km wide coastal strip are perfectly exposed as tilted fault blocks. The results of my field mapping and structural analysis show that the fault architecture of the area is dominated by a large NW-SE-striking fault system. A series of SE-dipping normal faults are consistent in cross-section with listric fault geometry, rooting into an <b>E-dipping</b> detachment at depth. Our mapping also revealed that left-steps in {{at least one of the}} major NS- striking faults are accommodated by a flower structure, but not by SW-NE-oriented cross faults as previously proposed in a neighboring area. Thus seismic activity is more likely to occur on the large NW-striking normal faults, leading to potentially larger Magnitude earthquakes than previously recognized in the area. The left-step may act as a barrier to rupture propagation and should be examined in more detail. The northwestern Red Sea coast is part of the straight coastal segment that is generally characterized as seismically inactive. However, during the geological field mapping, I found evidence for Plio-/Pleistocene vertical coastal uplift, likely due to earthquake-related coastal and offshore faulting. Pliocene marine deposits emerged recently due to sea level-drop and earthquake-related uplift. Even the presence of up to five distinct Pleistocene coral terraces implies that at least some of the coastal uplift was seismogenic, because terraces of the same age can be found at different elevations along strike. Presumably, some of the seawarddipping, N-S-striking normal faults are active today, despite the lack of recent instrumental seismicity. These findings imply long recurrence intervals for active faults in the northern Quseir area. These results differ from previously published results for the adjacent Quseir-Um Gheig sub-basin area, were E-W-striking strike-slip faults were mapped to offset the N-Sstriking faults, and had been inferred as earthquake-generating faults by Abd El-Wahed et al. (2010). Based on our mapping, we postulate that the large rift-parallel normal faults are seismogenic. Drainage network evolution within the study area is often structurally controlled and the nature of these controls was examined in this study. The Wadi Siatin stream channel network is classified in a relatively simple way, based on the high-resolution satellite data, with dendritic, and rectangular considered the most fundamental channel geometries. It was possible to distinguish the different morphological elements of the network, as well as the anomalies that affect the patterns. This analysis revealed, in the northern Red Sea area basins, the existence of old structures whose successive reactivations have left their mark on the drainage network. Comparison of joint systems direction with the directions of the main trunk stream channel of Wadi Siatin shows that the channel is highly affected by tectonic jointing. First-order channels follow easily erodable faults. Investigations concerning the relationship of stream-flow orientation with geological structure in the Wadi Siatin Basin shows that, generally, the least influenced flows are those of first-order which are governed simply by the valley side slopes on which they developed. However, in certain geological and geomorphological situations, there are clear exceptions to this generalization. Certainly, locally, geological control of these small streams may be even higher than in many streams of higher order. In the peripheral parts of the Basin, expansion of drainage into the available space has obviously been easiest along lines of weakness and, as a consequence of this, streams of the first order come to exhibit a high degree of adjustment to the underlying structure. The maximum structural control is reached by the streams of the third order. Towards the higher orders, the influence of local structure becomes weaker...|$|R
