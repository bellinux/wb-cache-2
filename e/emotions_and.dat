40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} {{examined}} the role of <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> control in children’s externalizing problems. Third- to sixth-grade children were administered a self-report measure of positive <b>emotion,</b> negative <b>emotion,</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> control. Peer- <b>and</b> teacher-reported adjustment problems were assessed. Structural equations modeling revealed that negative emotion, especially anger, was important in externalizing problems. Less positive emotion was associated with more external-izing problems. However, when negative emotion was examined in a more differ-entiated manner (anger, sadness and fear), the effect of positive emotion was diminished. Anger consistently emerged as {{a significant predictor of}} behavior problems. No interaction between either positive <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> control or negative <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> control was significant. Results showed main effects of each emotion component, with small interaction effects. Methodological and conceptual implications of the findings from the present study are discussed...|$|R

5|$|In {{between the}} time Scott {{released}} Alien in 1979 {{and returned to the}} franchise with Prometheus in 2012, he directed another notable science fiction film concerning artificial intelligence, Blade Runner, in 1982. Contrary to the white-blooded androids of Alien that emulate <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> recognize a disconnect with humanity, Blade Runner features the replicants- enhanced biorobotic humanoids that may only be identified by their lacking emotions. In order to maintain control, the replicants' human creators install false memories that detail entire lives that give them a sense of identity. Blade Runner, a largely influential film, has prompted a slew of philosophical questions concerning artificial intelligence and whether or not an android could truly be considered alive. The film specifically questions whether thoughts, a sense of identity, <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> consciousness in general, may be something genuine when applied to artificial intelligence. Due to David identifying himself as a living entity - similar to the replicants - film critics in 2012 would come not to only question if Prometheus was a direct prequel to Alien, but if the film had a relation to Blade Runner.|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> cognition as two interacting systems, both with {{important roles in}} decision-making, has been advocated by neurophysiological research (LeDoux, 1998; Damasio, 1994).

These two learning mechanisms embody very dierent properties which can be related with those of natural <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> cognitive systems...|$|R

40|$|Book synopsis: The {{interaction}} between <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> cognition {{is a fundamental}} issue which has only recently been reintroduced as a legitimate object of study in experimental psychology. This book examines the significant impact that affective processes have on reasoning, and demonstrates how emotional reasoning cannot simply be equated with faulty reasoning. <b>Emotion</b> <b>and</b> Reasoning presents contributions from leading researchers {{from a variety of}} disciplines, including experimental cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, clinical neuropsychology, and experimental psychopathology. The opening chapters consider how emotions affect reasoning processes in individuals living with psychopathology. A second section focuses upon experimental investigations of <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> basic reasoning processes, and a final section explores the physiological bases of emotion-reasoning interaction. Together, the chapters in this volume provide a multidisciplinary overview of key topics on <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> reasoning, and a survey of recent research in this area. <b>Emotion</b> <b>and</b> Reasoning will be of great interest to advanced students, researchers, and practitioners in the fields of cognitive psychology, clinical psychology, and affective neuroscience...|$|R

5|$|A {{small group}} of {{toddlers}} show a distressing way of reuniting after a separation. Called a disorganized/disoriented style, this reunion pattern can involve looking dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors that seem to imply fearfulness {{of the person who}} is being sought. Disorganized attachment has been considered a major risk factor for child psychopathology, as it appears to interfere with regulation or tolerance of negative <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> may thus foster aggressive behavior. Disorganized patterns of attachment have the strongest links to concurrent and subsequent psychopathology, and considerable research has demonstrated both within-the-child and environmental correlates of disorganized attachment.|$|E
5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to <b>emotions,</b> <b>and</b> instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E

5|$|Gender plays a {{large role}} within Fielding's moral critique, and effeminacy is a means to emphasise a male character's moral {{shortcomings}} or problematic deviations from social and cultural traditions. Starting with Love in Several Masques, the stock characters that he relies on emphasise the deviations by recalling traditional behavioural stereotypes and in their commentary on the masculinity or femininity of other characters. The political implications for gender extend to a criticism of powerful female within the domestic and public domains. Many of the problems portrayed within the plays are {{the results of the}} domestic sphere extended into politics, especially within Tom Thumb. As Jill Campbell points out, not only does Fielding critique women in power, but the reversals of gender and power serve as a way to say that private concerns are taking priority over public concerns. In his plays and his novels, women are used as a way to discuss the internal aspects of humans, which includes both <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> morality. Although Fielding sometimes uses females to express ideal ways to act, he does mock women who abuse their relationship with the internal, <b>emotions,</b> <b>and</b> morality to dominate and assume power. This theme appears as early as Love in Several Masques and continues throughout, especially in prose parody Shamela where Shamela falsifies claims to virtue to control and get ahead in life.|$|E

5|$|It was a multi-target success, with an {{audience}} {{not limited to}} viewers in their forties as the focus on 1980s nostalgia might have indicated. This countered a contemporary trend in series television to target a specific audience demographic. The plots include characters and situations for all ages, and the series' general tone is family-friendly. Although it includes a number of flashbacks, the scripts did not limit the actors to a 1980s viewpoint; according to consultant Mariela Mociulsky, the show reflects more modern realities (such as men showing their <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> women having greater autonomy in their lives) than TV shows of the 1980s did.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examined}} the antecedents {{of a positive}} wellness service experience by identifying factors leading to customers’ positive wellness service experience. This study proposes that servicescape has a positive relationship with the service experience, and that servicescape may strengthen the effects of <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> trust. The research hypotheses were tested with data collected directly from customers of a spa located in the Midwestern United States. A multiple regression analysis was conducted to estimate how <b>emotion,</b> trust, <b>and</b> servicescape affect customers’ evaluations of spa experiences. An estimation was carried out on the interaction effects between servicescape, <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> trust. The {{results indicate that the}} main effects of servicescape, <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> trust, were significant, while the interaction effects did not prove to be significant. Trust has the biggest effect on customers’ wellness experience followed by <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> servicescape. Prior research has not simultaneously addressed the role of servicescape, <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> trust and their subsequent influence on customers’ emotional evaluation of service experience. This study therefore provides valuable insight to extend present understanding of the simultaneous role of these factors as effective predictors of the evaluation of service experience...|$|R

40|$|Emotion might {{selectively}} affect {{spatial and}} verbal cognitive {{activities and the}} selective interaction patter   could be modulated by cognitive load. To test the hypotheses, the authors used event-related potentials (ERPs)    technique to investigate the interaction pattern of <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> working memory (WM) by typical WM n-back   tasks with low and high cognitive loads. In the 0 -back task, late ERP components for both spatial and verbal   WM were affected by induced emotional states consistently. However, in the 2 -back task, they could clearly   observe that induced emotional states selectively affected ERPs for spatial WM, but not for verbal WM. These   results suggested that the interactive pattern of <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> WM was modulated by cognitive load. In the   condition of low cognitive load, interaction of <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> WM was similar and nonspecific. However, with   the increasing of cognitive load, interaction of <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> WM became specific and selective.

Originality/value – The special issue gives space and consideration to under-explored and under-developed areas in the literature on <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> learning in the workplace: how emotional suffering can block workplace learning, race, <b>emotion</b> <b>and</b> learning in the workplace, <b>and</b> <b>emotion</b> in relation to ICT support for learning...|$|R
5|$|The {{idea was}} first {{discussed}} in 2000. To make the game {{feel like a}} film, Revolution brought in a cinematic consultant, Bob Keen, who made sure the game conveyed <b>emotions</b> <b>and</b> atmosphere appropriate for each scene. The game was originally planned to have similar cartoon-quality visuals as its prequels, but the developers decided to aim at a style similar to Japanese animated films. Unlike the first two Broken Sword games, which used the Virtual Theatre engine, The Sleeping Dragon was built with the RenderWare engine. The game's music was composed by Ben McCullough, and Rolf Saxon returned to voice George Stobbart.|$|E

Other characters have similar language-independent verbalizations, including laughter, surprised or fearful exclamations, and screams. Midna has the most voice acting—her on-screen dialogue is often accompanied by a babble of pseudo-speech, which was produced by scrambling English phrases sampled by Japanese voice actress Akiko Kōmoto.|$|E
