In our cases, the mission and purpose dictate every other aspect in the organisational life. Our findings from Reaktor and Buurtzorg are in line with the general assumption that in the future organisations will seek to use technology for everything that it can be used for. However, context specific decision-making that requires <b>judgment,</b> <b>interpreting</b> subtle cues, creative problem solving, ethical consideration and above all human-to-human communication, will become key elements in work, as they already are in our cases. There is currently nothing that suggests these needs to disappear with the emergence of sophisticated automation. Thus, organisations are likely to evolve to make the most out of those human abilities. For people, this shift in focus, at least in the cases we observed, increases job satisfaction, and makes work an integral element in life. At the root of the self-organised model in our cases seems to be a change in the mind-set which allows empowered individuals within the organisations the authority to pursue work that they see as meaningful and important. Designing and implementing IT-solutions that really {{meet the needs of the}} people they will be serving, and providing quality care that supports the autonomy of the clients to lead a good life, are only two examples of needs in our current societies that today predominantly are not met. Many comparable, deeply human but currently neglected, sources of work will be available even after adding layers of technology to our societies.|$|R

The life satisfaction {{is one of the}} components of subjective welfare that in value <b>judgment</b> is <b>interpreted</b> as a thought-and-sense character. The life satisfaction allows estimating the influence of different life scopes of older people and outlining the priority routes of continuous welfare.

Estimation of own older person’s life in its various forms, expresses significant levels of subjective well-being, revealing the superordinate connection through the content of emotional and evaluative bases, giving multidirectional nature of the subject’s activity, which may be taken into account only at opinion poll.

40|$|Program sensitivity, {{also known}} as Lipschitz continuity, {{describes}} how small changes in a program's input lead to bounded changes in the output. We propose an average notion of program sensitivity for probabilistic programs [...] -expected sensitivity [...] -that averages a distance function over a probabilistic coupling of two output distributions from two similar inputs. By varying the distance, expected sensitivity recovers useful notions of probabilistic function sensitivity, including stability of machine learning algorithms and convergence of Markov chains. Furthermore, expected sensitivity satisfies clean compositional properties and is amenable to formal verification. We develop a relational program logic called EpRHL for proving expected sensitivity properties. Our logic features two key ideas. First, relational pre-conditions and post-conditions are expressed using distances, a real-valued generalization of typical boolean-valued (relational) assertions. Second, <b>judgments</b> are <b>interpreted</b> in terms of expectation coupling, a novel, quantitative generalization of probabilistic couplings which supports compositional reasoning. We demonstrate our logic on examples {{beyond the reach of}} prior relational logics. Our main example formalizes uniform stability of the stochastic gradient method.

We also extend our logic with a transitivity principle for expectation couplings to capture the path coupling proof technique by Bubley and Dyer, and formalize rapid mixing of the Glauber dynamics from statistical physics...|$|R

In the present paper, I show that this interpretative perspective is incomplete. Understanding Kant's views on teleology and biology requires a consideration of the teleological and biological views of Christian Wolff and his rationalist successors. By reconstructing the Wolffian roots of Kant's teleology, I identify several little known sources of Kant's views on biology. I argue that one of Kant's main contributions to eighteenth-century debates on biology consisted in demarcating biology from metaphysics. Kant rejected Wolffian views on the hierarchy of sciences, according to which propositions specifying the functions of organisms are derived from theological truths. In addition, Kant argued that organic self-organization necessitates a teleological description in order to show that self-organization does not support materialism. By demarcating biology and metaphysics, Kant made a small yet important contribution to establishing biology as a science. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

In spite of such predictions, paper-based internal communication will remain the primary medium for disseminating information in organizations for decades to come. However, electronic technology {{will have an impact}} on paper information production that may be more profound than changes following word processing's introduction. Previously unavailable for everyday production to enhance word meaning, certain graphic techniques now can be used to access readers' preconditioned symbol meanings to increase comprehension of routine correspondence and information internalization. This quasi-experimental field study examines interactions among laser-printer graphic treatment and communication variables as contributors to explaining variance in comprehension. Set Multiple Regression/Correlation analysis identifies significant variance explained by conditional relationships between near-typeset quality text and readers' self-interest and between near-typeset quality text and text's readability. The conditional relationship of near-typeset quality and self-interest shows increase in reader comprehension at a greater rate than the comprehension increase rate attributed to the reader's self-interest increase alone. This suggests that conditional relationships may be accessing an internal <b>judgment</b> process <b>interpreting</b> greater self-interest in near-typeset printed text. The conditional relationship between near-typeset quality and readability reveals that at more difficult reading levels comprehension is greater for near-typeset text. The significance of this relationship indicates that an internal judgment process is involved rather than the difference being attributed to legibility treatment. The strength of these conditional relationships suggests that planning for communication policies and practices should be a part of organizational strategic planning in the same ways as are financial analysis, operations planning, or human resource management...|$|R

Previously we have {{proposed}} a signal detection theory (SDT) methodology for measuring metacognitive sensitivity (Maniscalco and Lau, Conscious Cogn 21 : 422 - 430, 2012). Our SDT measure, meta-dâ², provides a response-bias free measure of how well confidence ratings track task accuracy. Here we {{provide an overview of}} standard SDT and an extended formal treatment of meta-dâ². However, whereas meta-dâ² characterizes an observer's sensitivity in tracking overall accuracy, it may sometimes be of interest to assess metacognition for a particular kind of behavioral response. For instance, in a perceptual detection task, we may wish to characterize metacognition separately for reports of stimulus presence and absence. Here we discuss the methodology for computing such a response-specific meta-dâ² and provide corresponding Matlab code. This approach potentially offers an alternative explanation for data that are typically taken to support the unequal variance SDT (UV-SDT) model. We demonstrate that simulated data generated from UV-SDT can be well fit by an equal variance SDT model positing different metacognitive ability for each kind of behavioral response, and likewise that data generated by the latter model can be captured by UV-SDT. This ambiguity entails that caution is needed in interpreting the processes underlying relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve properties. Type 1 ROC curves generated by combining type 1 and type 2 <b>judgments,</b> traditionally <b>interpreted</b> in terms of low-level processes (UV), can potentially be interpreted in terms of high-level processes instead (response-specific metacognition).
