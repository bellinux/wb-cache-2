25|$|On {{the other}} hand, bullet or slug {{structures}} return the principal to investors {{in a single}} payment. The most common bullet structure is called the soft bullet, meaning that the final bullet payment is not guaranteed to be paid on the scheduled maturity date; however, {{the majority of these}} securitizations are paid on time. The second type of bullet structure <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> bullet, which guarantees that the principal will be paid on the scheduled maturity date. Hard bullet structures are less common for two reasons: investors are comfortable with soft bullet structures, and they are reluctant to accept the lower yields of hard bullet securities in exchange for a guarantee.|$|E

25|$|Trabecular bone (or cancellous bone) is the sponge-like bone in {{the ends}} of long bones and vertebrae. Cortical bone <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> outer shell of bones and the middle of long bones. Because osteoblasts and osteoclasts inhabit the surface of bones, trabecular bone is more active and is more subject to bone {{turnover}} and remodeling. Not only is bone density decreased, but the microarchitecture of bone is also disrupted. The weaker spicules of trabecular bone break ("microcracks"), and are replaced by weaker bone. Common osteoporotic fracture sites, the wrist, the hip and the spine, have a relatively high trabecular bone to cortical bone ratio. These areas rely on the trabecular bone for strength, so the intense remodeling causes these areas to degenerate most when the remodeling is imbalanced. Around the ages of 30–35, cancellous or trabecular bone loss begins. Women may lose as much as 50%, while men lose about 30%.|$|E
25|$|Running {{approximately}} parallel both to {{the coast}} of the Solent and to the A27, the M27 starts as an eastwards continuation of the A31 from Bournemouth and Poole, meets the A36 from Salisbury, crosses the Wessex Main Line railway, and then meets the M271 to central Southampton. After the M271, the road becomes a dual four lane motorway and passes Rownhams services, it then meets the M3, (two lanes going off, two lanes continuing {{to the other side of}} the junction) reverting to a dual three lane motorway as it passes to the north of Southampton, passes Southampton Airport, meeting Junction 7 and becoming dual four lanes again, then becoming dual three lanes after Junction 8, it then runs alongside the West Coastway Line as it heads south-east towards Fareham. It then runs alongside the northern outskirts of Fareham, briefly with a fourth climbing lane in either direction, before its junction with the M275 to Portsmouth. Very shortly after this point the motorway ends, becoming the A27, a four lane dual carriageway almost to motorway standards until the junction with the A3 (M) Motorway. The official reason for this section of road not being a continuation of the motorway <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> shoulders being too narrow. Although the M275 which the M27 junctions with, has no official hard shoulders throughout its entire length.|$|E

Sarah Crompton from The Daily Telegraph gave the collection {{four out of five}} stars and said: [...] "Madonna's Celebration shows just how consistently she delivers the goods, with tracks such as 'Music', 'Ray of Light', 'Frozen' and 'Don't Tell Me'", with [...] "only a couple of [...] which feel dispensable." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine gave the compilation four out of five stars and commented that [...] "functionally, what Madonna and fans are really celebrating with the release of Celebration <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> proof that Madonna's back catalogue is now so immense and so varied that she can release a behemoth, two-disc greatest hits package that shoehorns in 36 songs and still manages to significantly short-change the singer's legacy", though also noticing that [...] "the album is missing songs, doesn't always include the right ones, [...] seems to have been sequenced by a not particularly intuitive Genius playlist." [...] Tim Sendra from AllMusic praised that [...] "the collection does a fine job of living up to the title— it's certainly a celebration of Madonna's career and includes some of the most celebratory and thrilling pop music ever created." [...] While reviewing the double-disc deluxe edition version of the album, he commented: [...] "The 34-track double-disc Deluxe Edition has an easier time of it than the single-disc 18-track release does."

2500|$|Depending {{on which}} hard tissues are affected, it is {{possible}} to describe caries as involving enamel, dentin, or cementum. [...] Early in its development, caries may affect only enamel. [...] Once the extent of decay reaches the deeper layer of dentin, the term [...] "dentinal caries" [...] is used. [...] Since cementum <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> tissue that covers the roots of teeth, it is not often affected by decay unless the roots of teeth are exposed to the mouth. [...] Although the term [...] "cementum caries" [...] may be used to describe the decay on roots of teeth, very rarely does caries affect the cementum alone. [...] Roots have a very thin layer of cementum over a large layer of dentin, and thus most caries affecting cementum also affects dentin.|$|E
