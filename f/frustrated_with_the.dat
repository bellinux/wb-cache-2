5|$|Angie's storylines mostly {{deal with}} her family—husband Nick Bolen (Jeffrey Nordling) and son Danny Bolen (Beau Mirchoff)—and their {{attempts}} to escape their mysterious past, which is explored throughout the season. Although critics initially welcomed the character as a diverse addition to the cast, they grew <b>frustrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> slow pace of her storyline as the season progressed. Critics compared Angie to Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard), a character whose lagging storyline was slow in developing during the series' second season.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{was known}} for his direct {{approach}} to game journalism and scathing criticism of the video game industry. During his time at 1UP the site developed a greater profile and stepped out of its sister publication's shadow, but Smith grew <b>frustrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> contemporary state of gaming news and what he considered manipulation of journalists and readers into accepting promotional material as news. In April 2007 he left 1UP to become a Bungie writer and co-host of the developer's podcast.|$|E
5|$|The {{agencies}} which funded AI research (such as the British government, DARPA and NRC) became <b>frustrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lack {{of progress}} and eventually cut off almost all funding for undirected research into AI.

As a warden of the Scottish Marches he grew constantly more <b>frustrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> King's idleness, and eventually negotiated a peace treaty with the Scots. This action on Harclay's part amounted to treason, and early in 1323 he was apprehended by the King's men, and hanged, drawn and quartered.|$|E

While watching TV, Homer sees an advertisement that suggests he attend Lanley's institute of monorail conducting, which is a transparent effort to make even more money from the con. Homer immediately decides to enroll. After a three-week course, Lanley selects Homer at random from among his classmates to be the monorail conductor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Frustrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> legal hassles {{that went}} with land speculation, in 1788, Boone moved upriver to Point Pleasant, Virginia (now West Virginia).

In 1791, {{he was elected to}} the Virginia legislature for the third time. He contracted to provide supplies for the Kanawha militia, but his debts prevented him from buying goods on credit, so he closed his store and returned to hunting and trapping.|$|E
5|$|Hurd {{was cast}} after having {{appeared}} in other television shows by Law & Order creator Dick Wolf. Although Wolf promised her Jeffries would develop more over time, Hurd grew <b>frustrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{lack of material}} for her character. The show's producers hesitated to keep her as Munch's full-time partner and considered eliminating the character from the show altogether. Hurd eventually departed herself to join the drama television series Leap Years. The actress earned some critical praise for her performance as Jeffries, but several commentators said the character was never properly fleshed out.|$|E

40|$|We find a close {{correspondence}} between generalized Bell inequalities {{of a special}} kind and certain frustrated spin systems. For example, the Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt inequality corresponds to <b>the</b> <b>frustrated</b> square <b>with</b> <b>the</b> signs +++- for the nearest neighbor interaction between the spins. Similarly, the Pearle-Braunstein-Cave inequality corresponds to a <b>frustrated</b> even ring <b>with</b> <b>the</b> corresponding signs + [...] . +-. Upon this correspondence, the violation of such inequalities by the entangled singlet state in quantum mechanics {{is equivalent to the}} spin system possessing a classical coplanar ground state, the energy of which is lower than the Ising ground state's energy. We propose a scheme which generates new inequalities and give further examples, <b>the</b> <b>frustrated</b> hexagon <b>with</b> additional diagonal bonds and the frustrated hypercubes in n= 3, 4, 5 dimensions. Surprisingly, the hypercube in n= 4 dimensions yields an inequality which is not violated by the singlet state. We extend the correspondence to other entangled states and XXZ-models of spin systems.

5|$|In 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{passed the}} Affordable Care Act, {{which made the}} most sweeping reforms to the nation's healthcare system in nearly five decades, including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges. The law caused {{a significant reduction in}} the number and percentage of people without health insurance, with 24 million covered during 2016, but remains controversial due to its impact on healthcare costs, insurance premiums, and economic performance. Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained <b>frustrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> slow pace of the economic recovery. The Republicans, who stood in opposition to Obama's policies, won control of the House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014.|$|E

Despite having to give nine lectures a week, he found time to write his second book, Negative Ions (1938), and began working on upper atmospheric physics. <b>Frustrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> tiresome and time-consuming process of calculation, he had his physics workshop superintendent, John Wylie, build him a small-scale differential analyzer, an analog computer that could solve differential equations, for just £50. This was used to solve problems related to low temperature helium, and the photo-ionisation of oxygen in the upper atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|They toured in Canada in July and August 1985, and {{throughout}} Europe in October of that year, including in The Netherlands, England (one concert {{was held at}} the famous Hammersmith Palais in London), Ireland, Scotland, France, Switzerland, Belgium and West Germany. On October 2, 1985, the group played a concert in Bochum, West Germany, for the German TV show Rockpalast. Stipe had bleached his hair blond during this time. Fables of the Reconstruction performed poorly in Europe and its critical reception was mixed, with some critics regarding it as dreary and poorly recorded. As with the previous records, the singles from Fables of the Reconstruction were mostly ignored by mainstream radio. Meanwhile, I.R.S. was becoming <b>frustrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> band's reluctance to achieve mainstream success.|$|E
