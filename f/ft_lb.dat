40|$|This {{project is}} mainly {{concerned}} with {{a description of}} anatomical and ultrastructural characteristics of cell wall deformations in brittleheart of E. regnans, development of methodology for quantification of percentage of broken fibre pieces (PBFP) in E. regnans, and physical and anatomical properties of E. regnans in relation to the occurrence of brittleheart. Two 1939 regrowth E. regnans butt logs and one mature growth E. regnans butt log removed from a tree approximately 120 years old were used in the study. The anatomical and ultrastructural characteristics of cell wall deformations were examined with bright field, polarized light, and scanning electron microscopy. The microscopic compression lines were found to consist of slip planes, minute compression failures, corrugations, and buckles. The width of microscopic compression lines along the longitudinal fibre axis ranged from one single fold in the cell wall up to 7 times the average fibre width. The length of the microscopic compression lines ranged from ones which only crossed a few fibres to ones which crossed up to 200 fibres. The severity of microscopic compression lines appeared to be dependent on the type of cell wall deformations and degree of compaction in the deformed zone. In the methodology studies it was found that for a pulp sample prepared from a 2 mm by 2 mm by 15 mm wood chip approximately 400 cellular elements in 8 out of 16 areas on a slide needed to be counted in order to obtain PBFP with less than 10 % error. For macerated thin sections, all the cellular elements on 2 slides each carrying about 600 fibres and fibre pieces needed to be counted. A highly significant correlation was found between the length of microscopic compression lines per unit area and the microscopically determined PBFP. A highly significant correlation was found between the theoretical PBFP and the microscopically determined PBFP. These findings confirm that maceration of wood containing cell wall deformations results in broken fibres and verifies the validity of the maceration technique for quantifying the amount of microscopic compression lines. PBFP was found to increase with macerating time. A maceration time around 10 hours appears sufficient to cause fibres having cell wall deformations to break but longer times cause fibres without cell wall deformations to also break due to overmaceration. A significant relationship was found between PBFP determined after 5 hours and after 10 hours of maceration at the same temperature. It was found that parameters extracted or derived from cell length distributions produced by the Kajaani FS- 200 may be used to determine the amount of fibre fragments in pulp samples. These parameters were the high peak, the length weighted average, and the mass weighted average of the cell length distributions for pulps which had PBFP greater than 10. Based on the maceration technique, brittleheart was detected in both the mature and the 1939 regrowth logs. Brittleheart was more severe and occupied a larger area in the mature growth than in the regrowth wood. The PBFP was found to be mostly below 5 in the regrowth wood although relatively high PBFP values of 21 and 30 were observed. PBFP values as high as 85 was found in the mature growth wood. In general, PBFP was found to be higher nearer the pith, decreasing toward the bark, and dropping to zero before reaching the two-thirds theoretical point where the stress is assumed to be 0. A large circumferential variation in PBFP was observed in four adjacent growth rings of the mature log. A large variation in PBFP was also found within a volume of 1000 mm^ 3 for both the mature and the 1939 regrowth wood. The earlywood PBFP was found to be significantly higher than the latewood PBFP for the mature and regrowth logs. A total of 72 green and 132 12 % MC Izod specimens were prepared from the two 1939 regrowth logs and tested for impact strength. The mean Izod value was found to be 9. 9 <b>ft.</b> <b>lb</b> for the 132 12 % MC Izod specimens and 9. 2 <b>ft.</b> <b>lb</b> for the 72 green Izod specimens. For side-matched Izod specimens, the mean Izod value was found to be 9. 2 <b>ft.</b> <b>lb</b> at green and 9. 7 <b>ft.</b> <b>lb</b> at 12 % MC and the mean for the 12 % MC specimens did not reflect the expected increase in strength with moisture loss. Excessively low Izod values (eg. 1. 8 ft. Ib) were found in the 12 % MC Izod specimens located near the pith. For 76 12 % MC Izod specimens, their PBFP, fibre length, and specific gravity were also measured. Significant relationships (p= 0. 01) were found between Izod values and specific gravity, PBFP, and fibre length for these 76 12 % MC Izod specimens. Specific gravity and fibre length positively contribute to the impact strength whereas PBFP negatively affects the impact strength. Brash-break specimens showed a low mean Izod value, a low mean specific gravity, the presence of brittleheart, and a short mean fibre length.

40|$|Queensland, Australia {{decided to}} enquire into the {{following}} questions with regard to men working underground in hot conditions: (a) Which of the various heat stress indices predicts most accurately the effects on workmen of the various heat stress factors which occur in the mine at Mount Isa? (b) How best should the limits of heat stress be judged at which the normal 8 -hour shift should {{be reduced to a}} 6 -hour shift, or at which work should be stopped? With these objects in mind, oral temperatures were measured on 86 workmen after three hours of ordinary work in the mine and also on 36 occasions on 29 volunteers after three hours of stepping on and off a stool at a work rate of 1, 560 <b>ft.</b> <b>lb.</b> /min.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of four reinforcing steel bars were evaluated in the temperature range from - 40 °C (- 40 °F) to 40 °C (104 °F). The steel bars were: # 9 G 60 (sigmays = 60 ksi), # 9 G 40 (sigma ys = 40 ksi), # 6 G 60 (sigmays = 60 ksi), and # 6 G 40 (sigma ys = 40 ksi). Both tension and Charpy V-notch Impact tests were {{performed in the}} present study. The tensile tests were carried out using a portable loading frame. A hydraulic cylinder was used to provide the force necessary to pull the specimen to rupture and the load on the specimen was measured by means of three calibrated load cells. The strains were measured with a 2 " gage length extensometer, and the fracture strain was measured with calipers. The results of the tension tests showed that the yield and fracture stresses increase with decreasing temperature. The magnitude of the fracture strain does not change markedly with temperature. No consistent pattern can be discerned for the variations of yield strain with temperature. The Charpy impact tests were conducted by an Avery Charpy Impact Testing machine with a striking velocity of 16. 5 ft per sec and an initial energy 220 <b>ft</b> <b>lb</b> loaded as a simple beam configuration. The Charpy impact test showed that the steel bar lost impact resistance when the testing temperature was decreased.

The use of anionic polyacrylamide (PAM) as a soil amendment is an emerging conservation practice. However, guidelines have not been developed with considerations of soil properties and topographic characteristics. The objectives of these studies were to evaluate the effects of PAM, gypsum, or their combination for four dependent variables of time to initial runoff (TRO), cumulative runoff (RO), and cumulative sediment loss (SL) on different soil materials with selected slopes. Each soil material was packed to a bulk density of 1. 3 Mg m[superscript - 3] (81 lb ft[superscript - 3]) in soil test beds subjected to a 61 -mm h[superscript - 1] (2. 4 -in hr[superscript - 1]) simulated rainfall with a kinetic energy (KE) of 1. 5 kJ m[superscript- 2] h[superscript - 1] (103 <b>ft</b> <b>lb</b> ft[superscript - 2] hr[superscript - 1]) for 62 min. Differences in TRO, RO, and SL for soils, amendments, and slopes were all significant, as were their two-way interactions (p< 0. 01). Tested soil amendments had varied responses on TRO, RO, and SL within soils. For reducing SL, a high level of PAM had better performance at a steep slope compared to a low level of PAM or [less than or equal to] 40 % slope. Generally, the applications of PAM amendment were not effective in reducing RO, but increased TRO. Differing amendment performance for different soils and slopes make it necessary to continue to understand the soil-PAM bonding mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} measurements made of {{the duties}} imposed on the brakes of a heavy vehicle when driven over a continental route which included the Susten and other passes in Switzerland and in Austria. On the Susten Pass an investigation was {{made of the}} effect of driving in various gears. The following data were determined for each brake application: vehicle deceleration, rate of energy dis-sipation and total energy dissipated at the brakes, the energy lost by drag losses, the energy absorbed by engine braking, and the temperatures attained in all d r u m s and linings. Measurements were also made of the amount of energy imparted to the vehicle when it was accelerated by the engine between brake applications. Analysis of the results shows that a heavy vehicle travels at a fairly uniform speed down the mountain passes and consequently {{only a small percentage of}} the total energy dissipated is given to the vehicle by the engine in between braking. The work done at the brakes varied between 15 and 62 per cent of the total energy dissipated, the proportion depending on the steepness of the gradient and the driver’s choice of gear for the descent. The maximum amount of work done at the brakes (5. 66 x 107 <b>ft.</b> <b>lb)</b> was on the Susten Pass when the vehicle was driven in third gear. During such a journey the d r u m s attained an average temperature varying between 350400 °C while the linings reached an average temperature in the range 275 - 350 °C. A theoretical analysis is outlined which permits calculation of the temperatures attained at any stage of the descent. This analysis requires a knowledge of the work done in each brake application, together with cooling rates, and gives results in good agreement with the observed temperatures on the Susten Pass. Little difference was observed between the driving behaviour of the two drivers on the various passes; one driver made more brake applications per mile than the other but the duration of each application was less. Consequently, both applied their brakes for approximately tbe same total time and dissipated similar amounts of energy at the brakes when both used the same gear over the same descents...|$|E

40|$|The {{motion of}} a {{particle}} can be examined with {{the method of}} work and energy. Although many problems can be solved through Newton's second law, work and energy are very useful tools which can often make a solution easier to find. This module will discuss many aspects of work such as the work done by a weight, springs and gravity. We will also discuss kinetic and potential energy, the conservation of energy, and the relationships between power, energy and work. These topics are all {{related to each other}} and help to solve many dynamic applications. Work The concept of work relates directly to the force, mass, the displacement of the object and the velocity it is travelling at. An object experiences work if it is displaced while under an applied force. It is a scalar quantity with a sign, but no direction. Work is measured as <b>ft</b> <b>lb</b> or in lb in U. S. customary units, and N m, also known as Joules J, in S. I. units. As defined, the work a force exerts is defined as [...] . Eq. (1) where is the force acting on the object and is the differential displacement the object has travelled. The vectors F and dr are multiplied through dot product to find the scalar value of work [...] Eq. (2) Work can also be expressed as the sum of the product of each component [...] Eq. (3) A finite displacement of a force can be expressed as the integral of Eq. (1) across the displacement of the force [...] Eq. (4) If this is expressed in the rectangular components, [...] . Eq.
