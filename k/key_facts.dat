Although {{none of these}} reports has been officially confirmed, they generally indicate that the console is an extension (or advancement) of the Nintendo GameCube architecture. Specifically, the analyses report that the Wii is roughly 1.5 to 2times as powerful as its predecessor.

Whilst not contesting the <b>key</b> <b>facts,</b> he denied all charges on the grounds that he had always worked for a free and prosperous Norway, and submitted a sixty-page response. On 11 July, a further indictment was brought, adding a raft of new charges, including more murders, theft, embezzlement and, most worrying of all for Quisling, the charge of conspiring with Hitler over the 9 April occupation of Norway.|$|E

500|$|In 1996, a {{previously}} unpublished private account written in 1972 by Aldo Lampredi for the Communist Party's archives, appeared in L'Unità. In it, Lampredi confirmed the <b>key</b> <b>facts</b> of Audisio's story {{but without the}} embellishments. Lampredi was undoubtedly an eyewitness and, because he prepared his narrative for the private records of the Communist Party – and not for publication – it was perceived {{that he had no}} motivation other than to tell the truth. Furthermore, he had had a reputation for being reliable and trustworthy; he was also known to have disliked Audisio personally. For all these reasons it was seen as significant that he largely confirmed Audisio's account. After Lampredi's account was published, most, but not all, commentators were convinced of its veracity. The historian Giorgio Bocca commented that [...] "it sweeps away all the bad novels constructed over 50 years {{on the end of the}} Duce of fascism .... There was no possibility that the many ridiculous versions put about in these years were true...The truth is now unmistakably clear".|$|E
500|$|In Venezuela, {{debate about}} The Revolution Will Not Be Televised is [...] "often acrimonious". The film has become key to framing people's {{understanding}} {{of the events of}} April 2002. The previously accepted international view was that Chávez's ousting came from a [...] "spontaneous popular response" [...] to the repression of his regime; the film [...] "directly contradicts" [...] this position, and since its release it has rapidly become [...] "the prevailing interpretation of [...] ". The film's critics charge that it omits or misrepresents important events. Much of the criticism is centered on the filmmakers' [...] "use of stock [...] devices", such as compositing clips from several events to present them as one incident. Parallel editing also depicts sequences as if they occurred at the same time, when some of the footage was captured on different days. Bartley and ÓBriain justify these methods as standard practice in the construction of documentary realist films. Caracas-based journalist Phil Gunson, writing in Columbia Journalism Review, says that most of the film critics who embraced the film ignored [...] "the complex, messy reality" [...] of the situation. He charges that the filmmakers [...] "omit <b>key</b> <b>facts,</b> invent others, twist the sequence of events to support their case, and replace inconvenient images with others dredged from archives". Bartley and ÓBriain argue that Gunson's points are [...] "issues of dispute" [...] that [...] "continue to divide opinion" [...] in Venezuela. Author Brian A. Nelson says that Bartley and ÓBriain—in their initial meeting with Chávez—did more than merely invoke the Irish general Daniel O'Leary to gain the president's support for filming; Nelson alleges that they offered to portray the president positively in return for open access, with a [...] "you scratch my back if I scratch yours" [...] understanding that he says was ultimately reflected in the film's [...] "unabashed pro-Chavismo." ...|$|E

40|$|A <b>key</b> <b>fact</b> about M. -P. Schützenberger's (1972) {{promotion}} operator on rectangular standard Young tableaux is that iterating promotion {{once per}} entry recovers the original tableau. For tableaux with strictly increasing rows and columns, H. Thomas and A. Yong (2009) introduced {{a theory of}} K-jeu de taquin with applications to K-theoretic Schubert calculus. The author (2014) studied a K-promotion operator P derived from this theory, but showed that the <b>key</b> <b>fact</b> does not generally extend to K-promotion of such increasing tableaux. Here we show that the <b>key</b> <b>fact</b> holds for labels on the boundary of the rectangle. That is, for T a rectanglar increasing tableau with entries bounded by q, we have Frame(P^q(T)) = Frame(T), where Frame(U) denotes the restriction of U to its first and last row and column. Using this fact, we obtain a family of homomesy results on the average value of certain statistics over K-promotion orbits, extending a 2 -row theorem of J. Bloom, D. Saracino, and the author (2016) to arbitrary rectangular shapes. Comment: 12 page...|$|R

2500|$|Nearly {{a decade}} ago now, in 2008, Loyola {{students}} revealed to the legal tabloid Above the Law that Loyola had recently adopted a policy of excluding any student from participating in the school's on-campus interviewing (OCI) program if he had applied to transfer to other law schools. The exclusion applied even if a student's transfer application was still pending during OCI {{and even if the}} student had already paid tuition to Loyola for the next semester. In response to the Above the Law article, Loyola Dean Victor Gold wrote in a campus-wide e-mail that Above the Law [...] "misrepresents our policy, omits some <b>key</b> <b>facts,</b> and gets others wrong." [...] The purpose of the policy, Gold wrote, was to prevent transferring students from [...] "double-dipping" [...] by interviewing both at Loyola and at their new school. Furthermore, any student whose transfer application was rejected could apply for reinstatement in the OCI program. However, Above the Law noted that Gold did not dispute that Loyola banned tuition-paying students whose applications were still pending from participating in OCI. This policy was repealed soon thereafter.|$|E
2500|$|In Inward Hunger, Williams recounts that in {{the period}} {{following}} his graduation: [...] "I was severely handicapped in my research by my lack of money.... I was turned down everywhere I tried ... and could not ignore the racial factor involved". However, in 1936, thanks to a recommendation made by Sir Alfred Claud Hollis (Governor of Trinidad and Tobago, 1930–36), the Leathersellers' Company awarded him a £50 grant to continue his advanced research in history at Oxford. He completed the D.Phil in 1938 {{under the supervision of}} Vincent Harlow. His doctoral thesis was titled The Economic Aspects of the Abolition of the Slave Trade and West Indian Slavery, and was published as Capitalism and Slavery in 1944. It was both a direct attack on the idea that moral and humanitarian motives were the <b>key</b> <b>facts</b> in the victory of British abolitionism, and a covert critique of the idea common in the 1930s, emanating in particular from the pen of Oxford Professor Reginald Coupland, that British imperialism was essentially propelled by humanitarian and benevolent impulses. Williams's argument owed much to the influence of C. L. R. James, whose The Black Jacobins, also completed in 1938, also offered an economic and geostrategic explanation for the rise of British abolitionism.|$|E

But I had reached the conclusion that, from the standpoint of what the University's values would be interpreted to be by the broader public, that what was known was sufficiently serious as it relates to child sexual abuse that it would send the wrong message about our values as a University if Coach Paterno were allowed to coach as though none of this had ever happened." ...|$|E
