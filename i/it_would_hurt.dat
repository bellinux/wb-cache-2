5|$|The British Government {{called on}} Keynes's {{expertise}} during the First World War. While {{he did not}} formally re-join the civil service in 1914, Keynes travelled to London at the government's request {{a few days before}} hostilities started. Bankers had been pushing for the suspension of specie payments – the convertibility of banknotes into gold – but with Keynes's help the Chancellor of the Exchequer (then Lloyd George) was persuaded {{that this would be a}} bad idea, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> the future reputation of the city if payments were suspended before it was absolutely necessary.|$|E
5|$|In 1765, Parliament {{passed the}} Stamp Act which {{required}} colonists {{to pay a}} new tax on most printed materials. News of {{the passage of the}} Stamp Act produced an uproar in the colonies. The colonial response echoed Adams's 1764 instructions. In June 1765, Otis called for a Stamp Act Congress to coordinate colonial resistance. The Virginia House of Burgesses passed a widely reprinted set of resolves against the Stamp Act that resembled Adams's arguments against the Sugar Act. Adams argued that the Stamp Act was unconstitutional; he also believed that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> the economy of the British Empire. He supported calls for a boycott of British goods to put pressure on Parliament to repeal the tax.|$|E
5|$|San Martín and Belgrano {{met at the}} Yatasto relay. The {{army was}} in poor condition, and San Martín {{initially}} refused to remove Belgrano from the army, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> the soldiers' morale. However, the supreme director Gervasio Posadas (who replaced the triumvirate in government) insisted, and San Martín acted as instructed. San Martín stayed {{only a few weeks}} in Tucumán, reorganizing the army and studying the terrain. He also had a positive impression of the guerrilla war waged by Martín Miguel de Güemes against the royalists, similar to the Peninsular War. It was a defensive war, and San Martín trusted that they could prevent a royalist advance in Jujuy.|$|E

5|$|In August 1923, Evans {{participated in}} a Klan parade in the heavily Catholic borough of Carnegie, Pennsylvania, which was {{attacked}} by local residents. One member of the Klan was killed; Evans declared him a martyr and hoped that the death would inspire new recruits. The incident gave a fillip to the Klan's recruitment efforts, but increased Stephenson's animosity toward Evans, on whom he blamed the incident. Stephenson's proclivity for ostentation irritated Evans. Although Stephenson left his official Klan position after a short tenure, under his leadership the Klan's northern supporters had begun to rival those in the South. He had been a skilled campaigner and demagogue, and he remained a well-known advocate of the Klan's platforms after resigning. Evans avoided publicly clashing with him, fearing that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> the candidacies of Klan-backed politicians: Stephenson was closely involved in the successful gubernatorial candidacy of Indiana Klan-member Edward L. Jackson, and the Klan members had significant electoral gains in that state in 1924, including the election of several candidates to the state legislature. After these victories, Stephenson showed further disdain for Evans.|$|E
25|$|Following the Senate vote, Corker {{expressed}} his disappointment with the bill, stating, among other things, {{that it did}} not adequately address concerns about the integrity of loan underwriting, or the need to strengthen bankruptcy laws, and provide for orderly liquidation. The main critique of financial reform offered by Corker on June 10, 2010, at the joint House and Senate conference on Financial Regulation, was that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> industry and jobs if passed.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan was}} {{immediately}} criticized by Prime Minister Harper, who {{described it as}} a tax grab and compared it to the National Energy Program that the federal Liberal government adopted in the 1980s. On 11 September 2008, NDP leader Jack Layton also criticized the Green Shift, saying that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> consumers, would be nothing more than a nuisance for energy producers, and evaluates emission equally across all sectors instead of maximizing reductions where the cost is lowest. Layton further noted that Dion's proposal does not set a target for reducing emissions.|$|E
50|$|Adam Smith, in his 1776 book The Wealth of Nations, first rigorously {{analyzed}} {{the effects of}} a land value tax, pointing out how <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>hurt</b> economic activity, and how <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not raise land rents.|$|R

25|$|In 1995, after Ozzy Osbourne had {{finished}} recording the Ozzmosis album, {{a replacement for}} Zakk Wylde was needed for the tour. While working on his own band, Joe {{got a call from}} Deen Castronovo (Ozzy's drummer) to let him know they were seeking a guitar player. Joe went down to Audible Studios in Los Angeles and played three Ozzy classics. Holmes did not mention that he had taken lessons from Randy Rhoads (former guitarist for Osbourne) as he thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> his chances at the job. He succeeded though and got the part.|$|E
25|$|Senator William Jenner {{resigned}} {{shortly before}} the mid-term elections in 1958 and urged Handley to seek his seat. A plan was created where Handley would resign the governorship, his lieutenant would appoint him senator, and he could finish the term. When the plan was revealed to the party leadership, they strongly advised him to not implement the it because they feared <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> the party and {{be perceived as a}} scandal. Handley then decided to have the Secretary of State order an election for the office in November, and Handley himself ran for the position.|$|E
25|$|Springvale School {{was founded}} by Rev. Canon Robert Grinham and Maurice Carver, the founders of Ruzawi School, in 1952, as a second Anglican junior boys' school in Marondera. The school was born of the desire to cater for {{the large number of}} {{children}} on Ruzawi's waiting list which grew to 'epic proportions' in 1945. Canon Grinham fought against the proposal to expand Ruzawi's intake as he felt <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> the ethos of the school, thus pushing forward the idea of establishing another preparatory school. In 1949, the Ruzawi Board bought 1000 acres of land for £2 an acre from Jim Blake, the owner of Springvale Farm.|$|E

25|$|Swamy {{obtained}} Supreme Court Stay {{against the}} implementation of Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project (SSCP). He believes that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> the sentiments of {{people who believe that}} this shallow land connecting between Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka was built by the Hindu god Rama. He strongly opposes {{the implementation of}} SSSCP citing that implementing this scheme will be a criminal offence under section 295 Indian Penal Code. He wrote letters to Prime Minister of India in June 2009 asking him to stop the project and had informed the Supreme Court on 14 October 2015 that the government may not continue with the Sethusamudram Project.|$|E
25|$|As Prime Minister, he {{accepted}} both the American and Chinese views that the Soviet Union was an aggressive power with hegemonic ambitions in the South Pacific. Muldoon would {{also join the}} United States President Jimmy Carter and other Western leaders in condemning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and boycotting the 1980 Summer Olympics. However, his government {{did not participate in}} the US-led trade boycott against the Soviet Union since <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> New Zealand's predominantly agricultural export economy. In 1980, the National government also expelled the Soviet Ambassador, Vsevolod Sofinski, for handing money over to the SUP. Despite his antagonism towards the Soviet Union and domestic Communist movements, Muldoon's government still maintained economic relations with the Soviet Union.|$|E
500|$|In the end, the {{president}} and cabinet decided against selling the ships because they feared <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> them politically. This came despite a consensus agreeing that the ships should be disposed of, possibly to fund smaller warships capable of traversing Brazil's many rivers. The executive's apprehension was heightened by Barbosa's speech given before the revolt's end, as he also used the occasion to attack the government, or {{what he called the}} [...] "brutal militaristic regime." [...] Still, the Brazilians ordered Armstrong to cease working towards laying down their third dreadnought, which induced the Argentine government to not pick up their contractual option for a third dreadnought, and the United States' ambassador to Brazil cabled home to state that the Brazilian desire for naval preeminence in Latin America was quelled, though this proved to be short-lived.|$|E

500|$|Much of Stelmach's term as Premier was {{dominated}} by questions related to the Athabasca Oil Sands. The rapid development of these reserves was fuelling the Alberta economy's strong growth, but also raised environmental questions. After winning the Premiership, Stelmach emphasized {{that he had no}} intention of taking measures that would slow down oilsands development and suggested that the economy would find its own appropriate growth rate. He aggressively defended Alberta's oil at home and abroad, and called the idea that it was extracted at an unacceptably high environmental cost [...] "a myth". When Liberal Party of Canada leader Stéphane Dion proposed a federal carbon tax to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, Stelmach rejected the policy on the basis that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> the economy and would unfairly penalize the western provinces. Instead, he championed the development of carbon capture technology. In July 2008, Stelmach announced $2billion worth of funding for carbon capture initiatives, for which he was applauded by industry groups. However, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business called it [...] "a huge amount of money to spend on something that isn't proven", and Mike Hudema of Greenpeace suggesting that there were better environmental uses of the money available.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from her}} work as a vocalist and record artist, Carey was {{becoming}} known as a songwriter, having penned and produced all of her own material throughout her career. During the production of Music Box, she was approached by Epic Records to write and record a song alongside Afanasieff, and release it on the soundtrack to the 1992 film Hero, featuring Dustin Hoffman and Geena Davis. While Carey was interested in the project, Mottola was very adamant over allowing Carey to take part in anything involving film, fearing <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> her career. Additionally, Columbia felt uneasy about allowing their highest-selling recording artist to contribute to another label, even a branch of the same parent company, Sony. So they wanted to try the next best thing, which was to have us write something." [...] Still interested in working for the film, Carey agreed to pen the feature song for the film, intended for fellow female singer, Gloria Estefan. Carey and Afanasieff sat together in a studio in New York, and over the course of two hours, composed the song's melody, lyric and concept. In an interview with Fred Bronson, Afanasieff discussed the process in which they had completed the rough version of the song: ...|$|E
500|$|On March 5, 1770, {{a street}} {{confrontation}} resulted in British soldiers killing five civilians in {{what came to}} be known as the Boston Massacre. The accused soldiers were arrested on criminal charges and had trouble finding legal representation. Adams ultimately agreed to defend them, though he feared that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> his reputation. In arguing their case, Adams made his legendary statement regarding jury decisions: [...] "Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence." [...] He also expounded upon Blackstone's Ratio: [...] "It is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished, for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished. But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned, perhaps to die, then the citizen will say, 'whether I do good or whether I do evil is immaterial, for innocence itself is no protection,' and if such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of security whatsoever." [...] Adams won an acquittal for six of the soldiers. Two of them who had fired directly into the crowd were charged with murder but were convicted only of manslaughter. Adams was paid a small sum by his clients.|$|E

500|$|Palestine was {{secondary}} {{to the goal of}} protecting the [...] "Northern Tier" [...] of Greece, Turkey, and Iran from Communism, as promised by the Truman Doctrine. Weary of both the convoluted politics of the Middle East and pressure by Jewish leaders, Truman was undecided on his policy, and skeptical about how the Jewish [...] "underdogs" [...] would handle power. He later cited as decisive in his recognition of the Jewish state the advice of his former business partner, Eddie Jacobson, a non-religious Jew whom Truman absolutely trusted. Truman decided to recognize Israel over the objections of Secretary of State George Marshall, who feared <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>hurt</b> relations with the populous Arab states. Marshall believed the paramount threat to the U.S. was the Soviet Union and feared that Arab oil would be lost to the United States in the event of war; he warned Truman that U.S. was [...] "playing with fire with nothing to put it out". Truman recognized the State of Israel on May 14, 1948, eleven minutes after it declared itself a nation. Of his decision to recognize the Israeli state, Truman wrote in his memoirs: [...] "Hitler had been murdering Jews right and left. [...] I saw it, and I dream about it even to this day. The Jews needed some place where they could go. It is my attitude that the American government couldn't stand idly by while the victims [...] Hitler's madness are not allowed to build new lives." ...|$|E
