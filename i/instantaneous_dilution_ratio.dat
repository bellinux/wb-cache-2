30|$|Expansion of the {{electrical}} double layer is another mechanism {{which is considered}} an explanation for recovery enhancement. In this mechanism, oil adsorbed on the rock surface is displaced by low salinity water via swelling of {{the electrical}} double layer. In low salinity water, the ionic strength decreases and consequently {{the thickness of the}} electrical double layer increases. Therefore, ion exchange occurs with higher opportunity which results in desorption of oil from the rock surface (Lager et al. 2007). However, there exists an optimum <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> at which the highest oil recovery was obtained. In other words, reducing the salinity of water from a certain value is found to have an inverse effect on the oil production. In this study, it is observed that the highest ultimate oil recovery, 13.9 % IOIP, was obtained at a <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> of 20. So, this <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> was selected as the optimum <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> and the next series of tests were conducted with 20 -tdsw.|$|R

The morphology of the carbon xerogels showed that the size and number of the clusters produced during the sol–gel reaction is not only influenced by the pH but also by the <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio.</b> As with a decrease in the pH value, an increase in the <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> caused {{the formation of}} a small number of large clusters, leading to materials with large pores. However, depending on the values selected the effect of the pH and <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> was enhanced or diminished by the effect of the other.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the exhaust gas turbocharger on nano-scale Particulate Matter (PM) number emissions from a Gasoline Direct Injected (GDI) engine is investigated at fixed exhaust gas <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> for a matrix of three engine speeds and four engine load operating points. Experimental repeatability is assessed {{by means of the}} Coefficient of Variation (CoV) from three independent measurements for every test point. A hypothesis test on the difference between total number count before and after the turbine shows that there are statistically relevant variations for most operating points. A reduction in PM total number count at low load is observed, and an increment at high load. It is conjectured that as fuel injection pressure and duration increase with load, a larger share of volatile particulate matter is produced, which then undergoes nucleation as the exhaust gas expands through the turbine. At the same time, the centrifugal action within the turbocharger is believed to promote particle agglomeration and growth, and fragmentation of micro-scale particles. Experiments with variable <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> at a fixed engine test point show that changes in <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> affect repeatability of the emissions measurements only marginally. Yet, a hypothesis test on the variation of total number count with dilution shows that PM number counts are systematically affected by changes in <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio.</b> Furthermore, a hypothesis test also shows that the impact of the turbocharger on total number emissions is statistically relevant regardless of the <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> adopted...|$|R

Manure was placed in vessels with different surfaces (303, 475, and 595 cm 2), and water was added to create different <b>dilution</b> <b>ratios</b> (0 %, 50 %, and 100 %). The vessels were connected to glass capillaries with different ventilation rates through the headspace (0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 L min- 1) and were placed in climate-controlled rooms with different temperatures (10 °C, 20 °C, and 30 °C). We used a face-centered central composite design with 54 experimental units in two rounds of three blocks. Odor samples were taken at the end of experiment (after seven days). Manure samples were collected at the start and at the end of the experiment. The mean odor emission from the manure vessel was 2326 ouE h- 1 m- 2.

40|$|A {{dilution}} sampler {{was used}} {{to examine the effects of}} <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> and residence time on the particulate emissions from a pilot-scale pulverized coal combustor. Measurements include the particle size distribution from 0. 003 to 2. 5 {micro}m, PM{sub 2. 5 } mass emission rate and PM 2. 5 composition (OC/EC, major ions, and elemental). Hot filter samples were also collected simultaneously in order to compare the dilution sampler measurement with standard stack sampling methodologies such as EPA Method 5. Measurements were made both before and after the bag-house, the particle control device used on the coal combustor. Measurements were made with three different coal types and a coal-biomass blend. The residence time and <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> do not influence the PM{sub 2. 5 } mass emission rate, but have a significant effect on the size distribution and total number emissions. Measurements made before the bag-house showed increasing the residence time dramatically decreases the total particle number concentration, and shifts the particle mass to larger sizes. The effects of residence time can be explained quantitatively by the coagulation of the emitted particles. Measurements made after the bag-house were not affected by coagulation due to the lower concentration of particles. Nucleation of sulfuric acid vapor within the dilution was an important source of ultrafine particles. This nucleation is strongly a function of <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> because of the competition between condensation and nucleation. At low <b>dilution</b> <b>ratios</b> condensation dominates and little nucleation is observed; increasing the <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> promotes nucleation because of the corresponding decrease in available surface area per unit volume for condensation. No nucleation was observed after the bag house where conditions greatly favor nucleation over condensation; we suspect that the bag house removed the SO{sub 3 } in the flue gas. Exhaust SO{sub 3 } levels were not measured during these experiments. Dilution caused the enrichment of selenium, ammonium and sulfate in the PM{sub 2. 5 } emissions compared to the hot filter samples.

The importance of regression dilution for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -cholesterol {{and the extent to}} which this may differ from that for total cholesterol is not known. The aim of this study was to assess the magnitude of regression dilution bias for HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol and blood pressure after varying intervals of follow-up in two prospective cohort studies. METHODS: Regression <b>dilution</b> <b>ratios</b> were estimated for each risk factor using the correlations between baseline and re-survey values in the Glostrup Population Studies and the NHLBI Framingham Heart Study after various time intervals. The regression <b>dilution</b> <b>ratios</b> in each cohort after a fixed interval between measurements were compared. RESULTS: The regression <b>dilution</b> <b>ratios</b> after 10 years were 0. 51 and 0. 56 for systolic blood pressure in Glostrup and Framingham, respectively; 0. 52 and 0. 54 for diastolic blood pressure; and 0. 68 and 0. 63 for total cholesterol. In both studies, the regression <b>dilution</b> <b>ratios</b> for these risk factors became more extreme with increasing intervals between measurements. The regression <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> for HDL-cholesterol after 10 years in Glostrup was 0. 72, which suggests that the importance of regression dilution for HDL-cholesterol was similar to that for total cholesterol.

40|$|The {{introduction}} {{of an international}} standard on odour measurement presents a new challenge for olfactometry laboratories to meet tough new instrumental performance and panellist performance criteria. The paper reviews a number of olfactometers used {{in the last ten}} years both in Australia and overseas. It has found that the back pressure could contribute a significant error in the delivery of the required <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> and the contamination of the olfactometer was the source of large variation in olfactometry results. The paper discusses the instrumental performance of the newly developed olfactometer. DynaScent is a fourth generation olfactometer which uses no flow measurement device (flowmeter or mass flow controller). The <b>dilution</b> <b>ratios</b> of the DynaScent were calibrated using CO gas and auto calibration feature. The effects of the CO sampling point locations (within the system and above the sniffing cup) could have significant impacts on the <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio.</b> Practically, the manual calibration is both time consuming and labour intensive. Furthermore, it was found that the accuracy and instability results were sensitive to the selection of the CO gas range. It is concluded that the calibration of a dynamic olfactometer should be carried out more frequently than once a year. The DynaScent olfactometer was able to achieve averaged instability of 1. 7 % and accuracy of 9 % over the dilution range o...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Solidification {{cracking}} during welding is {{very serious}} problem for practical use. Therefore, {{there are so many}} reports concerning solidification cracking. Normally, solidification cracking susceptibility of material is quantitatively evaluated using Trans-Varestraint test. On the other hand, local solidification cracking strain was tried to measure precisely using in-situ observation method, called MISO method about 30 years ago. Recently, digital high-speed video camera develops very fast and its image quality is very high. Therefore, we have started to observe solidification crack using in site observation method. In this paper, the local critical strain of a solidification crack was measured and the high temperature ductility curves of weld metals having different <b>dilution</b> <b>ratios</b> and different grain sizes to evaluate quantitatively the effects of <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> and grain size on solidification cracking susceptibility by using an improved in situ observation method...|$|R
40|$|ICALEO 2002 - 21 st International Congress on Applications of Laser and Electro-Optics, Scottsdale, AZ, 14 - 17 October 2002 Laser surface {{alloying}} of Mo, WC and Mo-WC powders on CP-Ti alloys using high power Nd-YAG laser was performed. The optimum processing parameters, microstructure, dilution effect, and microhardness of the alloyed layers were investigated. A parameter window was mapped for achieving optimum alloyed layers that are free from porosities and cracks. With a constant thickness of pre-placed powder, the <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> and {{the thickness of}} the alloying layer was found to be proportional to the incident specific laser energy density. The microhardness of the alloyed layer on CPTi was found to be inversely proportional to the <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio.</b> XRD spectra show that new alloy phases are formed in the alloying layer.

40|$|Experimental and {{numerical}} {{studies are}} {{conducted on the}} thermal, chemical and dilution effects of buffer gas composition on autoignition of dimethyl ether (DME). The buffer gases considered are nitrogen (N 2), a mixture of N 2 and argon (Ar) at a mole ratio of 50 %/ 50 % and a mixture of Ar and carbon dioxide (CO 2) at a mole ratio of 61. 2 %/ 38. 8 %. Experiments are performed using a rapid compression machine (RCM) at compressed pressure of 10 bar, equivalence ratio (φ) of 1, and compressed temperature from 670 K to 795 K. The N 2 <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> considered ranges from 36. 31 % to 55. 04 %. The experimental results show that buffer gas composition has little impact on the first-stage ignition delay. However, {{significant differences in the}} total ignition delay as a function of buffer gas composition are observed in the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region. Compared to N 2, N 2 /Ar (50 %/ 50 %) mixture decreases the total ignition delay by 31 %. The chemical effects of buffer gas composition on the first-stage and total ignition delays are negligible. With increasing N 2 <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio,</b> the first-stage ignition delay slightly increases, while {{a significant increase in the}} total ignition delay is observed. Moreover, the NTC behavior of total ignition delay is noted to become more pronounced at high N 2 <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio.</b> The heat release during the first-stage ignition decreases as N 2 <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> increases. Results of numerical simulations with the Zhao DME mechanism over a wider range of temperature show good agreement with that of experiments. Further numerical simulations are conducted using pure N 2, Ar and CO 2 as buffer gases. Results indicate that the thermal effects are the dominant factor in low temperature and NTC regions. The chemical effects become pronounced in the NTC region, and the chemical effect of CO 2 exceeds the thermal effect at the compressed temperature higher than 880 K...|$|R

40|$|XRF {{analysis}} of {{major and minor}} elements in silicate rocks using fused glass discs at high <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio.</b> X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is an accurate, rapid spectroscopic technique for chemical element determinations on rock samples. The aim {{of this research was}} to evaluate a calibration method for the determination of major and minor elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe) in silicate rocks using fused glass discs with a 1 : 30 sample/borate dilution. The analytical method has been calibrated by using forty-two international rock standards. The accuracy appears acceptable for many mineralogical and petrographic purposes. A high <b>dilution</b> <b>ratio</b> makes possible the use of a small amount of sample (225 mg) to obtain good castings in high-melting materials. By contrast, the decrease of the analytical intensity makes not easy the determination of trace elements at the typical concentration levels of geological samples...|$|R
