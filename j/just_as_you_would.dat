25|$|For one thing, {{we would}} no longer allow breeding. People could not create {{different}} breeds. There would be no pet shops. If people had companion animals in their homes, those animals {{would have to be}} refugees from the animal shelters and the streets. You would have a protective relationship with them <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> with an orphaned child. But as the surplus of cats and dogs (artificially engineered by centuries of forced breeding) declined, eventually companion animals would be phased out, and we would return to a more symbiotic relationship—enjoyment at a distance.|$|E

"It {{should be}} made clear that if {{fundamentalism}} or terrorism exist, they are {{a reaction to the}} colonial militarism of the West in the Islamic world, from the 18th century until today. European armies occupied all of North and South America and Africa, in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, and divided them among themselves. Then they came to the Islamic world in North Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. It is only natural that the Muslims act in accordance with their religious duty, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> defend your homes if they were occupied. Why do we call resistance 'terrorism'? When Hitler and the Fascists rolled Europe in blood and dust – would your forefathers be called terrorists if they conducted resistance?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'And at {{your own}} homes,' resumed the bride of the colonel, 'it <b>would</b> be <b>just</b> <b>as</b> bad. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> be sent to bed, or {{something}} equally undignified. Again, how <b>would</b> <b>you</b> support us?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Exactly; had you {{reasoned}} a month, {{you could}} not have hit upon a better solution of the difficulty than this. Treat this Kitty Huguenin <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> treat Kitty Marble." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Acton {{smiled at}} him graciously. [...] "That," [...] she observed, [...] "was quite nice of you. Things haven't gone <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have liked them to go, in the city?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But if it's {{caused by}} my being here,' said the young lady, 'don't mind me a bit, for I'm quite as bad. You may go on <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{if you were}} alone.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I <b>would</b> have <b>you</b> believe nothing, James,' {{returned}} the other. 'Be <b>as</b> <b>just</b> to me <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{to any other}} man below you. You ask a question, and I answer it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Norman," [...] she said, [...] "there's {{nothing to}} mind. He looks <b>just</b> <b>as</b> usual. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> not {{know there was}} {{anything}} the matter." [...] But he rested his head on his hand, and {{looked as if he}} could not stir. [...] "I see it won't do," [...] said Ethel--"don't try--you will be better by-and-by, and he has not asked for you in particular." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did; and a queer York fashion {{it is to}} give a house a name, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> a Christian being; {{that must}} be a Roman Catholic custom, and some way {{connected}} with idolatry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This gentleman is my assistant," [...] he said, [...] "and {{you will}} allow him to pass in and out <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> myself. He is going to take this case entirely in hand, and you will regard him as being in charge here." ...|$|E
6000|$|Por. Unkind! can you, whom only I adore, [...] Set open to your slave the prison-door? [...] You use {{my heart}} <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> afford [...] A fatal freedom to some {{harmless}} bird, [...] Whom, breeding, you ne'er taught to seek its food; [...] And now let fly to perish in the wood.|$|E
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. That is <b>just</b> <b>as</b> well, for <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{be bored}} to death. There {{has been a}} meeting of magistrates in the village, and my brother has brought them all in to lunch.|$|R
5000|$|The {{document}} formalized efforts begun under Truman {{to deploy}} newly developed {{tactical nuclear weapons}} small enough for most Air Force and Navy planes. The administration believed {{that they would be}} useful both during a general war and to deter a local one in Europe, and Eisenhower said of tactical weapons that [...] "on strictly military targets and for strictly military purposes, I see no reason why they shouldn't be used <b>just</b> exactly <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> use a bullet or anything else".|$|R
6000|$|... "I like you, kid," [...] she said. [...] "You're not fresh. You {{know what}} I am {{as well as}} the rest of them, but you wait on me <b>just</b> the same <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> on"--she hesitated and there was a little catch in her voice as she {{finished}} her sentence--"just the same <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> on a decent girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Holiday, [...] "I put you, {{for this}} journey, under your uncle George's care. I delegate my parental power over you to him. It is your duty, therefore, to obey him in all things, and {{to comply with}} all his wishes, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> if I were in his place." ...|$|E

"O, {{walk along}} with them <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> if you had not been chosen; only you will decide all the {{questions}} that come up, such as where you shall go, and how long you shall stay in the different places.

6000|$|... "Sam {{has gone}} under, mate," [...] Harry replied. [...] "That chute you went down was only just {{wide enough for}} the boat to go through, and no doubt he was knocked off {{it at the same}} time as you were; but as the Indian was on your side, he saw nothing of Sam. I reckon he sank at once, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have done if Hunting Dog hadn't been behind you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{story of}} my little {{adventure}} is a simple one," [...] Sir Timothy said. [...] "I {{do not think it}} greatly affects my character. I believe, as a matter of fact, that I am <b>just</b> <b>as</b> wicked <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have me be, but I have friends in every walk of life, and, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> know, I like to peer into the unexpected places. I had heard of this man Billy the Tanner. He beats women, and has established a perfect reign of terror in the court and neighbourhood where he lives. I fear I must agree with you that there were some elements of morality--of conforming, at any rate, to the recognised standards of justice--in what I did. You know, of course, that I am a great patron of every form of boxing, fencing, and the various arts of self-defence and attack. I just took along one of the men from my gymnasium who I knew was equal to the job, to give this fellow a lesson." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gene Stewart, it {{certainly}} <b>would,</b> unless <b>you</b> turn {{over a new}} leaf," [...] retorted Florence. [...] "But don't be a fool." [...] And here she became earnest and appealing. [...] "Go away, Gene. Go join the rebels across the border--you're always threatening that. Anyhow, don't stay here and run any chance of stirring Al up. He'd kill <b>you</b> <b>just</b> the same <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> kill another man for insulting your sister. Don't make trouble for Al. That'd only make sorrow for her, Gene." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no finer training," [...] resumed Uncle Chris, {{completely}} at his ease once more, [...] "than the chorus. How {{many of the}} best-known actresses in America began in that way! Dozens. Dozens. If I were giving advice to any young girl with theatrical aspirations, I should say 'Begin in the chorus!' On the other hand," [...] he proceeded, turning to Mr. Pilkington, [...] "I {{think it would be}} <b>just</b> <b>as</b> well if <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not mention the fact of my niece being in that position to Mrs. Waddesleigh Peagrim. She might not understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if they were, I couldn't {{afford to}} buy, with this Irish Encumbered Estates' Bill. But now, {{this is one}} thing I wanted to say. Is {{everything}} here <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> wish? Of course no one could wish a better tenant; but any repairs, you know, or improvements which I ought to do of course? Only {{tell me what you}} think should be done; for, of course, you know more about these things than I do--can't know less." ...|$|E
60|$|Catgut.--Steep the {{intestines}} of any animal {{in water for}} a day, peel off the outer membrane, then burn the gut inside out, which is easily {{to be done by}} turning a very short piece of it inside out, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> turn up the cuff of your sleeve; then, catching hold of the turned-up cuff, dip the whole into a bucket, and scoop up a little water between the cuff {{and the rest of the}} gut.|$|E
60|$|When {{you wish}} to raise a fine, large, donkey-voiced Shanghai rooster, you {{do it with a}} lasso, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> a bull. It is because he must be choked, and choked effectually, too. It is the only good, certain way, for {{whenever}} he mentions a matter which he is cordially interested in, the chances are ninety-nine in a hundred that he secures somebody else's immediate attention to it too, whether it be day or night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Or, rather," [...] {{proceeded}} Jimmy, [...] "would {{you care}} to crack a crib while I came along with you? Strictly speaking, I am here on a vacation, but a trifle like this isn't real work. It's this way," [...] he explained. [...] "I've taken a fancy to you, Spike, and I don't {{like to see you}} wasting your time on coarse work. You have the root of the matter in you, and with a little coaching I could put a polish on you. I wouldn't do this for everyone, but I hate to see a man bungling who might do better! I want to see you at work. Come right along, and we'll go up-town, and you shall start in. Don't get nervous. <b>Just</b> work <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> if I were not there. I shall not expect too much. Rome was not built in a day. When we are through, I will criticize a few of your mistakes. How does that suit you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'These {{people are}} not taught to adopt these habits by word of mouth. They live with us and do as we do. Two young married women are sitting in my room now. I didn't call them in, nor {{tell them what to}} do. [...] "We didn't quite {{understand}} what you said last night." [...] "Well, I have written it out,--there it is." [...] They took, as usual, the MS., sat down, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> or anyone <b>would</b> do, at the table to read it, and are now making their short notes of it. Anyone comes in and out at any time, when not at school, chapel, or work, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> they please. We each have our own sitting-room, which is in this sense public property, and of course they fall into our ways.|$|R
60|$|During {{the greater}} part of the watch, the sailors sat on the {{windlass}} and told long stories of their adventures by sea and land, and talked about Gibraltar, and Canton, and Valparaiso, and Bombay, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> and I <b>would</b> about Peck Slip and the Bowery. Every man of them almost was a volume of Voyages and Travels round the World. And what most struck me was that like books of voyages they often contradicted each other, and would fall into long and violent disputes about who was keeping the Foul Anchor tavern in Portsmouth at such a time; or whether the King of Canton lived or did not live in Persia; or whether the bar-maid of a particular house in Hamburg had black eyes or blue eyes; with many other mooted points of that sort.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, no," [...] he said. [...] "Some of us {{were talking}} about that the other night at the club, {{and one of the}} fellows was saying that he {{believed}} there was as much old-fashioned, quiet, almost countrified life in New York, among the great mass of the people, as you'd find in any city in the world. Said you met old codgers that took care of their own furnaces, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> in a town of five thousand inhabitants." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wherever {{branches}} of one tree touch those of another, {{and you know}} in a thick forest this is frequently the case, he travels about freely if he wants to. But those trees are so big that I suspect {{he spends most of}} his time in the one in which his home is," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "However, if an enemy appears in his home tree, he makes his escape by jumping from one tree to another, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{the worst}} of it is that every one around me is so damnably jealous. It isn't what I've lost that will crush me, but what men will say that I've lost. Ever since I began to stand for Westminster there has been a dead set against me in the City. The whole of that affair of the dinner was planned,--planned, by G----, that it might ruin me. It was all laid out <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> lay the {{foundation}} of a building. It is hard for one man to stand against all that when he has dealings so large as mine.' ...|$|E
60|$|If the Allegory be not <b>as</b> <b>just</b> and apposite <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have it be, you may, however, see by it {{in a full}} View, the State of the Man, and how the Devil {{carries on}} his Designs; nothing is more common, and I believe there are few {{thinking}} Minds but may reflect upon it in their own Compass, than for our Passions and Affections to flow {{out of the ordinary}} Channel; the Spirits and Blood of the Soul to be extravasated, the Passions grow violent and outragious, the Affections impetuous, corrupt and violently vicious: Whence does all this proceed? from Heaven we can't pretend it comes; if we must not say 'tis the Devil, whose Door must it lie at? Pride swells the Passions; Avarice moves the Affections; and what is Pride, and what is Avarice, but the Devil in the Inside of the Man? ay, as personally and really as ever he was in the Herd of Swine.|$|R
5000|$|For two months, she {{performed}} nursing duties at Ft. Schuyler, sending letters back home {{that would later}} be published posthumously as her memoir. In her letters, she tells of preparing men for amputations and sometimes death while snow and rain poured in through the slats of the hospital roof, and the wind rocked the building outside. When her father again expresses concern that she is too sick to continue {{the life of a}} military nurse, she reminds him that she, like her brother, has committed to a military life: [...] "Remember that I am in the army <b>just</b> <b>as</b> Chauncy is and I must be held to work <b>just</b> <b>as</b> he is; <b>you</b> <b>would</b> never think of requesting that he not be sent on picket duty because it was hard work." [...] Despite her commitment, her health continued to deteriorate, and she had to take a break from her responsibilities and return home.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear mother," [...] he wrote, [...] "this {{will come}} to you when I have set off on a four years' voyage round the world. Father has {{convinced}} me that it's {{time for me to}} be doing something for myself; and I couldn't get a school to keep--and, after all, education is got other ways than at college. It's hard to go, because I love home, and hard because you will miss me-- though no one else will. But father may rely upon it, I will not be a burden on him another day. Sink or swim, I shall never come back till I have enough to do for myself, and you too. So good bye, dear mother.
