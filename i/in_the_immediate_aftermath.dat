40|$|Ministers clearly {{believe that}} harsh {{sentences}} for those convicted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recent disorder, and the arrest and prosecution {{of those involved}} (even in minor ways) will create strong disincentives for future potential rioters.

Sentences that are disproportionate for the offences {{that have taken place}} will likely be overturned. And enforcing ‘collective punishments’ on whole households by removing benefits and social housing for the families of those convicted may be hard to enforce and is legally dubious.

5|$|After {{returning}} to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his fleet {{in the northern}} Adriatic, where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack. The Italian ships never came, and on 12 August, the two countries signed the Armistice of Cormons; this ended the fighting {{and led to the}} Treaty of Vienna. Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the Battle of Custoza, the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz. As a result, Austria, which became Austria-Hungary in the Ausgleich of 1867, was forced to cede the city of Venice to Italy. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the war, the bulk of the Austrian fleet was decommissioned and disarmed.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, {{the bulk}} of the {{civilian}} population and the remaining Croatian police and troops fled over snow-covered terrain in poor weather to Karlovac, Ogulin, and to the nearby territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Approximately 30–60 civilians, largely elderly people, remained in Saborsko. The JNA and SAO Krajina troops forced those who remained behind to leave the village, killing or abusing the civilians. At least 25 civilians were murdered by the troops <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> of the capture of Saborsko.

The fort site remained relatively undisturbed in the ensuing years. In 1994 the non-profit Apple River Historical Foundation was organized and archaeological investigation was conducted in 1995. In June 1997 a reconstruction effort ended, and today a replica of the fort stands to the south of the original site, which remains undisturbed to preserve its archaeological integrity.|$|E

Independence from donor subsidies is widely viewed as a desirable goal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> microfinance industry, {{and a number of}} donors are building full cost recovery objectives into their support for post-conflict microfinance programs. The appropriateness of the full cost recovery paradigm in post-conflict environments is questionable, given the high operating costs faced by post-conflict micro finance agencies, weak demand for the most profitable microfinance services, and limitations on rapid improvements in local economic capacity, particularly in remote. areas. This paper reviews the issues raised by full cost recovery in post-conflict environments, with particular reference to a microfinance scheme in Bougainville, a province of Papua New Guinea currently in recovery from a prolonged period of armed conflict...|$|R
500|$|What unity English Protestants {{had shared}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plot's <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> {{began to fade}} when in 1625 James's son, the future Charles I, married the Catholic Henrietta Maria of France.

During Charles's reign Gunpowder Treason Day became increasingly partisan. [...] Between 1629 and 1640 he ruled without Parliament, and he seemed to support Arminianism, regarded by Puritans like Henry Burton as a step toward Catholicism. [...] By 1636, under the leadership of the Arminian Archbishop of Canterbury William Laud, the English church was trying to use 5November to denounce all seditious practices, and not just popery.
