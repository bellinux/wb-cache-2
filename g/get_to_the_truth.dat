25|$|In October 2010, it was {{revealed}} that Fox was developing a potential spin-off series that would be built around a new recurring character that would be introduced in the sixth season. The potential spin-off series would also be created by Bones creator/executive producer Hart Hanson, and be based on The Locator series of two books written by Richard Greener. The character of Walter is described as an eccentric but amusing recluse in high demand for his ability to find anything. He is skeptical of everything—he suffered brain damage while overseas, which explains his constant paranoia and his being notorious for asking offensive, seemingly irrelevant questions to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> Production on the episode was scheduled to begin in December 2010, but was delayed to early 2011 due to creative differences.|$|E

5000|$|The {{subject of}} {{justification}} {{has played a}} major role in the value of knowledge as [...] "justified true belief". Some contemporary epistemologists, such as Jonathan Kvanvig assert that justification isn't necessary in <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> and avoiding errors. Kvanvig attempts to show that knowledge is no more valuable than true belief, and in the process dismissed the necessity of justification due to justification not being connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Robust Virtue Epistemology (RVE) {{maintains}} {{that knowledge is}} achieved just when an agent <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> through, or because of, the manifestation of intellectual virtue or ability. A notorious objection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{view is that the}} satisfaction of the virtue condition will be insufficient <b>to</b> ensure <b>the</b> safety of the target belief; that is, RVE is no anti-luck epistemology. Some of the most promising recent attempts <b>to</b> <b>get</b> around this problem are considered and shown to ultimately fail. Finally, a new proposal for defending RVE as a kind of anti-luck epistemology is defended. The view developed here turns importantly on the idea that knowledge depends on ability and luck {{in a way that is}} gradient, not rigid, and that we know just when our cognitive success depends on ability not rather, but more so, than luck...|$|R
