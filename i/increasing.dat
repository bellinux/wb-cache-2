5000|$|Propagation delay <b>increases</b> with {{operating}} temperature, as {{resistance of}} conductive materials tends to <b>increase</b> with temperature. Marginal <b>increases</b> in supply voltage can <b>increase</b> propagation delay since the upper switching threshold voltage, VIH (often {{expressed as a}} percentage of the high-voltage supply rail), naturally <b>increases</b> proportionately.

Wide-scale <b>increases</b> in organ mass have often been attributed to a metabolic response to <b>increased</b> energy intake and utilization. On a constant diet, however, <b>increased</b> food intake is also associated with <b>increased</b> protein intake. We hypothesized that, while <b>increased</b> food intake itself {{may be responsible for}} <b>increases</b> in digestive tract mass, the consequent <b>increased</b> protein intake would be the factor responsible for <b>increased</b> kidney mass and function. Thus, we exposed male and female mice to diets differing in protein level (7 %, 15 % or 46 % casein by mass) at different acclimation temperatures (5 °C or 23 °C). Within an acclimation temperature, food intake rate remained constant over the entire range of dietary protein level, and protein intake rate <b>increased</b> as dietary content <b>increased.</b> The mice in the cold-acclimation group Summary <b>increased</b> food intake rate by 48 – 120 % over those in the warm-acclimation group.
