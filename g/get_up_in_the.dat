500|$|The {{incident}} that inspired Berlin to write [...] "Oh!

The buglers were unable to comply because it exceeded the range of their instruments, so the oblivious officer ordered them to practice Cohan's song. He wrote it as [...] "a thin little sergeant." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Oh! How I Hate to <b>Get</b> <b>Up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Morning" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Irving Berlin in 1918 that gives a comic {{perspective}} on military life. Berlin composed the song {{as an expression of}} protest against the indignities of Army routine shortly after being drafted into the United States Army in 1918. [...] The song soon made the rounds of camp and became popular with other soldiers, partly because hatred of reveille was universal.|$|E

500|$|Angelou chose [...] "Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie" [...] as the volume's title {{because of}} her {{interest}} in unconscious innocence, which she says is [...] "even lovelier than trying to remain innocent."

How I Hate to <b>Get</b> <b>Up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Morning". The song was a centerpiece of the show; both it and Berlin's performance received favorable reviews.

Brooks accepted the role to go against type, and because he loved that Bernie was not a cliché. [...] "There are six people you could always get to play this kind of part, and I like that the director was thinking outside of the box. For me, it was an opportunity to act outside the box.

[...] Referring to the Observer September, Pinker added that the episode would also peel [...] "back some layers about what his agenda has been and use that as an opportunity to revisit the things on the show we’ve seen before." [...] Fellow executive producer J.H. Wyman elaborated [...] "We always said you would find out about the Observers this season {{and we were going to}} investigate them a lot more.

That’s why we <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning is to take people along for the ride. We’re excited about what’s coming up, too." ...|$|E
