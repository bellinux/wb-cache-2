Despite an <b>economic</b> <b>depression</b> brought about by the demise of cotton spinning, Royton's population has continued to grow as a result of intensive housing redevelopment which has modernised its former Edwardian districts.|$|E
50|$|The {{book was}} {{frequently}} criticized by economists after {{it became a}} best-seller, as it focused on a darker side of capitalistic development, notably Batra's main claim that excessive inequality in capitalist societies can lead to financial crises and <b>economic</b> <b>depressions.</b> Importantly, the prediction in the title did not materialize.|$|R
50|$|Structural {{adjustment}} policies, as {{they are}} known today, originated due {{to a series of}} global economic disasters during the late 1970s: the oil crisis, debt crisis, multiple <b>economic</b> <b>depressions,</b> and stagflation. These fiscal disasters led policy makers to decide that deeper intervention was necessary to improve a country's overall well-being.|$|R

5|$|As {{construction}} began, Tenrikyo followers {{founded the}} Oyasato Construction Young Men's Association Hinokishin Corps, which volunteered time and labor {{to help build}} the yakata. The corps still continues their work today. By 1956, {{one corner of the}} complex had been built at the cost of 23billion yen, an enormous expense given the <b>economic</b> <b>depression</b> of the time.|$|E
5|$|Federal Reconstruction in Mobile {{began after}} the Civil War and {{effectively}} ended in 1874 {{when the local}} Democrats gained control of the city government. The {{last quarter of the}} 19th century was a time of <b>economic</b> <b>depression</b> and municipal insolvency for Mobile. One example can be provided by the value of Mobile's exports during this period of depression. The value of exports leaving the city fell from $9 million in 1878 to $3million in 1882.|$|E
5|$|From 1881 through 1914, {{approximately}} 2million Jews {{immigrated to}} the United States from Europe. An estimated three-quarters of them settled in New York City, primarily in the Lower East Side. Over 75,000 of these immigrants were from Romania, where Jews faced antisemitic laws, violence and expulsion. These hardships, combined with low crop yields and <b>economic</b> <b>depression,</b> resulted in 30 percent of the Jews in Romania emigrating to the United States.|$|E

5|$|In 1969 Brookley Air Force Base {{was closed}} by the Department of Defense, dealing Mobile's economy a severe blow. The closing {{resulted}} in a 10% unemployment rate in the city.

The loss of jobs created numerous problems and resulted in loss of population as residents moved away for work.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s Unicamp {{consolidated}} {{itself as}} one of the leading research and education centers in Latin America but also brought new challenges: just as with other public universities in Brazil, the high payroll costs (over 90% of the total budget) constrain investment and expansion.

5|$|The {{construction}} of taller buildings during the 1870s was hindered {{by the financial}} Panic of 1873 and the ensuing <b>economic</b> <b>depression,</b> which lasted until around 1879. Construction slowed, and property values slumped. By 1880, however, the recovery was well underway, with new construction in New York returning to the pace of 1871, and the economic upturn making the {{construction of}} taller buildings an attractive financial option again, establishing many of the preconditions {{for the development of}} the skyscraper.|$|E
5|$|The global <b>economic</b> <b>depression</b> of {{the early}} 1930s {{affected}} Ireland less because of the partial recovery following {{the civil war and}} because industry was protected behind tariff barriers established in the Anglo-Irish Trade War (1932–1938). The need for extra sea capacity was readily met by British and other foreign ships. Foreign ships were used, rather than preserving the home fleet. Banks were reluctant to lend to Irish industry, preferring British government gilts.|$|E
40|$|This {{interdisciplinary}} paper uses world-systems {{analysis as}} {{a theoretical framework}} to argue that both the 1870 s, 1930 ’s <b>economic</b> <b>depressions</b> reduced mean global temperatures. As global consumer demand fell, factories worldwide began producing less commodities and, as a result, emitted less greenhouse gasses. We find that in both instances {{there is evidence to}} support the hypothesis that financial crises lead to cooler temperatures...|$|R

The <b>economic</b> <b>depression</b> that {{followed}} World War I in Germany prompted Doctor Hartmann to find work in Changsha, China, and Erich spent his early childhood there. The family was forced to return to Germany in 1928, when the Chinese Civil War broke out. During World War II, Hartmann's younger brother, Alfred, also joined the Luftwaffe, serving as a gunner on a Junkers Ju 87 in North Africa. He was captured by the British and spent four years as a prisoner of war.|$|E

40|$|Many of {{the most}} {{significant}} events in international relations wars,coups, revolutions, massive <b>economic</b> <b>depressions,</b> <b>economic</b> shocks arerare events. They occur infrequently but are considered of greatimportance. In international relations, as in other disciplines, rareevents that is, binary dependent variables characterized by dozens tothousands of times fewer 1 s (events such as wars or coups) than 0 s(nonevents) have proven difficult to explain and predict. Thoughscholars have made substantial efforts to quantify rare events, theyhave devoted less attention to how these events are analyzed. We showthat problems in explaining and predicting rare events stem primarilyfrom two sources: popular statistical procedures that underestimate theprobability of rare events and inefficient data-collection strategies. We analyze the issues involved, cite examples from the internationalrelations literature, and offer some solutions. ...|$|R
40|$|Although fewer {{patients}} with tuberculosis {{are reported in}} a far advanced stage of the disease than ever before, the proportion of persons dying of tuberculosis whose disease had not previously been diagnosed appears to be increasing. The average length of sanatorium treatment, and the intramural case fatality rates have not shown much decrease. Tuberculosis mortality rates fall during <b>economic</b> <b>depressions</b> and rise with business booms. Epidemics of influenza do not always increase tuberculosis death rates. Common claims to the contrary are not sustained by recent California data...|$|R
5|$|From {{the early}} 15th century on the Shetlanders had sold their goods through the Hanseatic League of German merchantmen. This {{trade with the}} North German towns lasted until the 1707 Act of Union when high salt duties {{prohibited}} the German merchants from trading with Shetland. Shetland then went into an <b>economic</b> <b>depression</b> as the Scottish and local traders were not as skilled in trading with salted fish. However, some local merchant-lairds took up where the German merchants had left off, and fitted out their own ships to export fish from Shetland to the Continent. For the independent farmer/fishermen of Shetland this had negative consequences, as they now had to fish for these merchant-lairds.|$|E
5|$|In 1832 President Andrew Jackson had vetoed a rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States, an {{institution}} which he felt extended credit to northeastern commercial tycoons {{at the expense}} of the ordinary frontiersmen of the Old Southwest, a region with which Jackson, a Tennessean, strongly identified. In 1836 Jackson had issued an executive order called the Specie Circular which demanded that all land transactions in the United States be conducted in cash. Both of these actions, combined with the <b>economic</b> <b>depression</b> following the Panic of 1837 (caused partly by Jackson's fiscal policies) increased the domestic need for minted money.|$|E
5|$|Postan {{argued that}} {{demography}} {{was the principal}} driving force in the medieval English economy. In a distinctly Malthusian fashion, Postan proposed that the English agrarian economy saw little technical development during the period and by the early 14th century was unable to support the growing population, leading to inevitable famines and <b>economic</b> <b>depression</b> as the population came back into balance with land resources. Postan began the trend towards stressing continuities between the pre- and post-invasion economies, aided by fresh evidence emerging {{from the use of}} archaeological techniques to understand the medieval economy from the 1950s onwards.|$|E
40|$|Credit spreads are large, {{volatile}} and countercyclical, and recent empirical work suggests that risk premia, not expected credit losses, {{are responsible for}} these features. Building {{on the idea that}} corporate debt, while fairly safe in ordinary recessions, is exposed to <b>economic</b> <b>depressions,</b> this paper embeds a trade-off theory of capital structure into a real business cycle model with a small, exogenously time-varying risk of economic disaster. The model replicates the level, volatility and cyclicality of credit spreads, and variation in the corporate bond risk premium amplifies macroeconomic fluctuations in investment, employment and GDP...|$|R

5|$|Beginning in 1879, Walker and the {{political}} economist Henry George engaged in a prominent debate over economic rents, land, money, and taxes. Based {{on a series of}} lectures delivered at Harvard, Walker published his Land and Its Rent in 1883 as a criticism of George's 1879 Progress and Poverty. Walker's position on international bimetallism influenced his arguments that the primary cause of <b>economic</b> <b>depressions</b> was not land speculation, but rather constriction of the money supply. Walker also criticized George's assumptions that technical progress was always labor saving and whether land held for speculation was unproductive or inefficient.|$|R
