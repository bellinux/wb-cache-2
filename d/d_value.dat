Data included in this data set were from studies that reported K <b>d</b> <b>values</b> and were conducted in systems consisting of C Natural soils (as opposed to pure mineral phases) C Low ionic strength solutions (< 0. 1 M) C pH values between 4 and 10 C Solution cadmium concentration less than 10 - 5 M C Low humic materials concentrations (< 5 mg/l) C No organic chelates (such as EDTA) A total of 174 cadmium K <b>d</b> <b>values</b> were found in the literature (see summary in Section C. 3. 0). At the start of the literature search, attempts were made to identify K d studies that included ancillary data on aluminum/iron-oxide concentrations, calcium and magnesium solution concentrations, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), clay content, redox status, organic matter concentrations and sulfide concentrations. Upon reviewing the data and determining the availability of cadmium K d measurements having ancillary information, K <b>d</b> <b>values</b> were collected that included information on clay content, pH, CEC, total organic carbon (related to organic matter), and dissolved cadmium concentrations. The selection of these parameters was based on availability of data and the possibility that the parameter may impact cadmium K <b>d</b> <b>values.</b> Of the 174 cadmium K <b>d</b> <b>values</b> included in our tabulation, 62 values had associated clay content data, 174 values had associated pH data, 22 values had associated CEC data, 63 values had total organic carbon data, 172 values had associated cadmium concentration data, and 16 had associated aluminum/iron-oxide data.

The two isoforms are heterodimers of slightly different large (80 kDa) subunits and an identical small (28 kDa) subunit, so that the difference in K (<b>d)</b> <b>values</b> must reside in the large subunits. As assayed here, these K (<b>d)</b> <b>values</b> relate to the Ca(2 +) required for {{the first phase of}} calpain activation and do not reflect the lower Ca(2 +) then required by fully activated calpain. On the basis of sequence comparison and the X-ray structure of m-calpain, many m-type residues in the C-terminal EF-hand-containing domain IV were converted into the corresponding mu-type residues, but these mutations did not produce the expected decrease in K (d). In a series of hybrid (mu/m) large-subunit calpains, the K (<b>d)</b> <b>values</b> decreased progressively towards that of mu-calpain as the proportion of mu-type sequence increased from 0 to 90 %.

40|$|Objective: The {{effectiveness}} of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders {{in children with}} autism spectrum disorders (ASD) was examined, and compared with children without ASD. Method: Children with ASD and comorbid anxiety disorders (n = 79, 58 boys; Mage = 11. 76) and children with anxiety disorders (n = 95, 46 boys; Mage = 12. 85), and their parents, participated. All families were referred to 1 of 7 mental health care centers and received the same CBT. Anxiety, quality of life, ASD-like behaviors, and emotional-behavioral problems were measured at waitlist (ASD-group only, n = 17), pretest, posttest, and 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after CBT. Results: CBT was more effective than waitlist for treating anxiety disorders (d = − 1. 45) and anxiety symptoms (d = − 0. 48) in children with ASD. At 2 years follow-up, 61 % of the children with and 64 % without ASD were free of their primary anxiety disorder (percentages not significantly different). The decrease in severity of anxiety disorders after CBT (<b>d</b> <b>values</b> ranging between − 1. 05 and − 1. 46) was not different for children with and without ASD. Improvements were less in children with ASD for (only) 2 out of 7 continuous outcomes measures: anxiety symptoms (<b>d</b> <b>values</b> ranging between − 0. 68 and − 0. 94 vs. <b>d</b> <b>values</b> ranging between − 0. 98 and − 1. 25) {{and quality of life}} (<b>d</b> <b>values</b> ranging between 0. 39 and 0. 56 vs. <b>d</b> <b>values</b> ranging between 0. 77 and 0. 98).

40|$|In {{order to}} predict the {{bioavailability}} of toxic metals in soils undergoing degradation of organic matter (OM) and iron oxides (IOs), {{it is vital to}} understand the roles of these soil components in relation to metal retention and redistribution with time. In this present work, batch competitive sorptions of Pb(II), Cu(II), and Cd(II) were investigated between 1 and 90 days. Results showed that competition affected Cd(II) sorption more than Cu(II) and Pb(II). The sorption followed the trend Pb(II) >[*]>[*]Cu(II) [*]>[*]Cd(II), irrespective of aging, and this high preference for Pb(II) ions in soils reduced with time. Removal of OM led to reduction in distribution coefficient (K <b>d)</b> <b>values</b> of ≈ 33 % for all cations within the first day. However, K d increased nearly 100 % after 7 days and over 1000 % after 90 -day period. The enhanced K <b>d</b> <b>values</b> indicated that sorptions occurred on the long run on surfaces which were masked by OM. Removal of IO caused selective increases in the K <b>d</b> <b>values,</b> but this was dependent on the dominant soil constituent(s) in the absence of IO. The K <b>d</b> <b>values</b> of the IO-degraded samples nearly remained constant irrespective of aging indicating that sorptions on soil components other than the IO are nearly instantaneous while iron oxides played greater role than other constituents with time. Hence, in the soils studied, organic matter content determines the immediate relative metal retention while iron oxides determine the redistribution of metals with time...|$|R

40|$|Background: Recent autopsy {{study showed}} a high {{incidence}} of cerebrovascular lesions in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To assess the impact of cerebrovascular pathology in AD, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to study AD patients with and without cerebrovascular lesions. Materials and Methods: Conventional and DTI scans were obtained from 10 patients with probable AD, 10 AD/V patients (probable AD with cerebrovascular lesions) and ten normal controls. Mean diffusivity (D) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values of some structures involved with AD pathology were measured. Results: <b>D</b> <b>value</b> was higher in AD patients than in controls in hippocampus and the cingulate gyrus. In AD/V patients, increased <b>D</b> <b>value</b> was found in the same structures and also in the thalamus and basal ganglia compared to controls. There was a significant difference of <b>D</b> <b>value</b> between AD and AD/V patients. FA value reduced in the white matter of left inferior temporal gyrus and in the bilateral middle cingulate gyrus in patients with AD/V compared with controls. The MMSE (mini-mental state examination) score significantly correlated with FA value in the right hippocampus (r= 0. 639, P< 0. 019), in the right anterior cingulate gyrus (r= 0. 587, P< 0. 035) and in left parahippocampal gyrus (r= 0. 559, P< 0. 047). Conclusion: Cerebrovascular pathology had stronger impact on the <b>D</b> <b>value</b> than the AD pathology alone did.
