Among various clutter suppression methods, the eigen- based filter has shown potential because it can theoretically adapt its stopband to the actual clutter characteristics even when tissue motion is present. This paper presents a formative review on how eigen-based filters should be designed to improve their practical efficacy in adaptively suppressing clutter without affecting the blood <b>flow</b> <b>echoes.</b> Our review is centered around a comparative assessment of two eigen-filter design considerations: 1) eigen-component estimation approach (single-ensemble vs. multi-ensemble formulations), and 2) filter order selection mechanism (eigenvalue-based vs. frequencybased algorithms). To evaluate the practical efficacy of existing eigen-filter designs, we analyzed their clutter suppression level in two in vivo scenarios with substantial tissue motion (intra-operative coronary imaging and thyroid imaging). Our analysis shows that, as compared with polynomial regression filters (with or without instantaneous clutter downmixing), eigen-filters that use a frequency-based algorithm for filter order selection generally give Doppler power images with better contrast between blood and tissue regions. Results also suggest that both multi-ensemble and single-ensemble eigen-estimation approaches have their own advantages and weaknesses in different imaging scenarios. It may be beneficial to develop an algorithmic way of defining the eigen-filter formulation so that its performance advantages can be better realized. © 2010 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the temporal relationship between the early pregnancy peak of circulating human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) concentration and the establishment of maternal blood flow in the placental intervillous space. The presence of blood <b>flow</b> <b>echoes</b> within intervillous space was determined by colour Doppler imaging from 44 women with clinically uncomplicated pregnancy between 6 and 18 weeks gestation. Circulating HCG, free α- and βHCG subunits, oestradiol and progesterone concentrations were immunoassayed in blood samples collected at the time of Doppler examination. A continuous intervillous blood flow was detected in all cases with a gestational age ≥ 11. 7 weeks (n = 18) but never before this time. Circulating concentrations of free αHCG, oestradiol and progesterone were linearly or exponentially correlated with gestational age (r = 0. 860, 0. 903 and 0. 538 respectively, all with P < 0. 001), indicating steady increase of these hormones with advancing gestation. However, the best fitted lines were found to be parabolic for HCG (r = 0. 771, P < 0. 001) and βHCG (r = 0. 695, P < 0. 001), their highest points corresponding to 11. 24 and 10. 74 weeks gestational age respectively. The close temporal relationship between the Doppler advent of intervillous maternal blood flow and the HCG peak suggests that the establishment of the intervillous blood flow is associated with the decline in circulating HCG concentrations.

Left atrial abnormality (low left atrial appendage <b>flow,</b> spontaneous <b>echo</b> contrast, or thrombi), complex aortic plaque (mobile, ulcerated, pedunculate, or thickness≥ 4 mm), or both were defined as TEE risk. The incidences of ischemic stroke, cardiovascular events, and death were higher in patients with TEE risk than in those without the risk (2. 0 %/year vs. 0. 5 %/year, p< 0. 05; 4. 7 %/year vs. 1. 9 %/year, p< 0. 01; and 4. 7 %/year vs. 2. 0 %/year, p< 0. 01, respectively).

40|$|Certain tiger moths emit {{high-frequency}} clicks to an attacking bat, {{causing it}} to break off its pursuit. The sounds may either orient the bat by providing it with information that it uses to make an attack decision (aposematism) or they may disorient the bat by interrupting the normal <b>flow</b> of <b>echo</b> information required to complete a successful capture (startle, jamming). At what point during a bat’s attack does an arctiid emit its clicks? If the sounds are aposematic, the moth should emit them early in the attack echolocation sequence {{in order to allow}} the bat time to understand their meaning. If, however, the sounds disrupt the bat’s echo-processing behaviour, one would expect them to be emitted later in the attack to maximize their confusion effects. To test this, we exposed dogbane tiger moths (Cycnia tenera) to a recording of the echolocation sequence emitted by a big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) as it attacked a stationary target. Our results demonstrate that, at normal echolocation intensities, C. tenera does not respond to approach calls but waits until the terminal phase of the attack before emitting its clicks. This timing is evident whether the moth is stationary or flying and is largely independent of the intensity of the echolocation calls. These results support the hypothesis of a jamming effect (e. g. ‘phantom echoes’) and suggest that, to determine experimentally the effects of arctiid clicks on bats, {{it is important that the}} bats be tested under conditions that simulate the natural context in which this defence operates...|$|R

The imaging of venous blood with SWI is a blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) technique {{which is why it}} was (and is sometimes still) referred to as BOLD venography. Due to its sensitivity to venous blood SWI is commonly used in traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and for high resolution brain venographies but has many other clinical applications.

40|$|The use of {{acoustics}} {{to measure}} near-bed sediment transport processes has gained increasing acceptance within the sedimentological community {{over the past}} two decades. The idea of using sound to study fundamental sediment processes in the underwater environment is attractive, and, in concept, straightforward. A pulse of high-frequency sound is transmitted downward from a directional sound source usually mounted a meter or two above the bed. As the pulse propagates down toward the bed, sediment in suspension backscatters a proportion of the sound and the bed generally returns a strong echo.

Duplex sonography was performed on all patients and selective angiography was available from 17 vertebral artery dissections.  RESULTS—MRI showed ischaemic lesions of the brain in 18 of 19 patients (95 %). In the acute and subacute stage, MRA detected signal abnormalities within the dissected vertebral artery in 94 % (16 / 17) and MRI was specific for a dissection in 29 % (5 / 17). Sensitivity of selective angiography was 100 % and specificity was 35 % (6 / 17). Combination {{of the results of}} both methods increased the specificity to 50 %. Duplex sonography was sensitive in 79 % (15 / 19), but lacked specific results.

The heart of the animal could be depicted without movement artifacts. The use of a <b>flow</b> compensated gradient <b>echo</b> sequence allowed simultaneous observations of ventilation, reflected by water flow through the gill chambers as well as of haemolymph flow.

Both ventilation and haemolymph flow decreased during progressive cooling and changes in haemolymph flow varied between arteries.

PDA was confirmed in all infants using colour Doppler echocardiography, and serial observations of the ductal flow pattern were made. Infants randomly assigned to receive conventional indomethacin treatment (protocol group) were given an initial dose of 0. 2 mg/kg, followed by 0. 1 or 0. 2 mg/kg, depending on age, 12 hourly for two further doses, and were eligible for a second course. Those randomly assigned to the ductal <b>flow</b> pattern assessment (<b>ECHO</b> group) received further doses of indomethacin after 24 hours, only if their flow pattern was "pulsatile" or "growing. " RESULTS—There {{was no significant difference}} in the primary outcome measures between the two groups. The closure rate was 89. 1 % and 87. 2 %, respectively, in the protocol and ECHO groups. The mean (SD) doses of indomethacin were significantly higher in the protocol group: 3. 2 (1. 4) doses compared with 1. 6 (0. 9) doses.

Less frequently (~ 10 % of the time), a poleward flow enhancement was detected even when a streamer propagated equatorward, the poleward flow enhancement being located {{to the west of the}} auroral streamer, or to the east of the equatorward flow enhancement, consistently with the spatial relationship between flow shear and upward field‐aligned currents in plasma sheet flow bursts. The azimuthal width of the flow channel is, on average, ~ 75 [*]km, and the azimuthal offset of the equatorward flow channel relative to the auroral streamer is ~ 57 [*]km eastward. This study demonstrates the capability of radar‐imager pairs for identifying the 2 ‐D structure of localized flows associated with plasma sheet flow bursts.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{in this paper}} how the STEAM sequence can be an efficient tool to obtain images free of flow artifacts in anatomical situation where the spin echo failed. The simplest way to eliminate flow artifacts is to exploit the dephasing induced by motion in magnetic field gradients and to reduce to zero the signal from moving tissues. This can be achieve by increasing the time elapsed between the spin excitation and the signal observed. Because of T 2 relaxation, such an increase results in a signal decrease when the spin echo sequence is used. The STEAM sequence has the unique property that the time elapsed between observation and excitation can be increased without change in T 2 value and so allows a good suppression of signals from the moving spins with short TE. Our results demonstrate that, although the stimulated echo intensity is only half that of a spin echo taken at the same read out time, the advantages of STEAM imaging can compensate for this partial loss in signal to noise in some particular clinical situations. The influence of mixing time on contrast has been evaluated using thoracic spine imaging {{and it has been}} shown that contrast between spine and CSF can be significantly improved (+ 60 %) when TM is increased (from 17 ms to 50 ms). In the same time, the contrast between spine and fat issue decreases (40 %). This last effect facilitates the adjustment of contrast window. Suppression of motion artifacts has first been evaluated with thoracic spine imaging, using a whole body coil. Suppression of artifacts was better than that obtained with a <b>flow</b> compensated spin <b>echo</b> sequence, especially in the case of kyphotic patients when a presaturation band was inefficient. In a second step suppression of motion artifacts has been evaluated from posterior fossa examination after injection of a paramagnetic contrast agent. The images obtained with the stimulated echo sequence show a dramatic reduction of signal from blood in the lateral sinus, and therefore an increase of quality by elimination of motion artifacts...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{demonstrate}} the feasibility of NMR tomography at 3 Tesla for selected medical applications and to investigate {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the high field strength. For cardiac imaging a fast, ECG gated, <b>flow</b> compensated gradient <b>echo</b> sequence was implemented and optimized. Within a breath-hold period (17 heartbeats) artifact-free images of slices of any desired orientation, e. g. short axis slices, and cine-sequences, i. e. the movement of the heart within a slice during the heart cycle, could be acquired. With the use of specially developed multi-element surface coils for receiving in combination with the whole body resonator for transmitting, an increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by a factor of 2 was achieved compared to a field strength of 1. 5 T. Regions of different magnetic susceptibility cause larger B 0 inhomogeneities (± 1 ppm), leading to shorter T 2 * relaxation times within the left ventricle (20 ms). Therefore cardiac imaging, and especially the use of real-time imaging sequences, which are prone to artifacts, is likely to be ore difficult at 3 T compared to lower field strength. The decrease of T 2 * with increasing magnetic field strength is attributed to susceptibility effects; hence a higher BOLD (B lood O xygenation L evel D ependent) contrast is expected at 3 T, which can be exploited for tissue oxygenation and perfusion measurements. At 3 T the RF-wavelength within the body is comparable to body dimensions, thus dielectric resonances influence the electromagnetic field distribution. This may lead to B 1 field inhomogeneities. Furthermore, compared to 1. 5 T, 4 fold higher RF-power is needed to achieve the same flip angle of the magnetization at the same pulse length. Therefore the use of spin echo sequences and various preparation sequences is more difficult at 3 T. In the second part of the work a MR thermography technique (temperature probe method), using a paramagnetic Praseodymium complex (Pr-MOE-DO 3 A) as a contrast media, was investigated in combination with a fast spectroscopic imaging technique (E cho P lanar S pectroscopic I maging, EPSI) aiming at therapy control of regional hyperthermia treatment. Using the EPSI method, in a phantom the distribution of absolute temperature was measured in a volume of 24 ´ 24 ´ 24 cm 3 (voxel size 1. 5 ´ 1. 5 ´ 1. 5 cm 3) within 14 s to an accuracy of ± 0, 45 °C. This work demonstrates that the use of higher field strengths is not only accompanied by advantages but also by substantial disadvantages. Although having great potential for medical research and special areas of medical diagnostics and therapy control, MR imaging and spectroscopy at high field strengths (? 3 T) is unlikely to replace the clinically well-established MR tomography at lower field strengths (1. 0  1. 5 T). </P...|$|R
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. This thesis integrates {{the data from}} field, petrographic, X-ray, and lead and uranium isotopic studies on the Port Radium pitchblende deposit, Great Bear Lake, Canada. The oldest rocks exposed are andesitic-dacitic bedded tuffs and <b>flows</b> of the <b>Echo</b> Bay group. Overlying detrital rocks of the Cameron Bay group were accumulated before intrusion of hypabyssal, dacitic porphyry bodies and granitic rocks. Sandstones of the Hornby Bay group lie unconformably on the above groups and on denuded granitic rocks. Folds are generally open in the Echo Bay and Cameron Bay groups; the Hornby Bay group is flat-lying. The Echo Bay group was metamorphosed to hornblende hornfels facies rocks, probably during intrusion of granitic rocks. Fault and fracture zones, most commonly striking northeasterly and dipping steeply north, were in places loci for the successive introduction of "giant quartz veins", diabase dykes, and complex vein mineralizations. In {{the development of the}} Port Radium deposit, six stages of metallic and non-metallic vein mineral deposition are recognized. Three periods of wall rock alteration are correlative with episodes of vein mineralization. Tuffs of the Lower Echo Bay subgroup are the predominant host rocks to the ore mineralization. Localization of the pitchblende is attributed to physical factors. Diabase sills, intruded after development of the Port Radium deposit, were fractured during late-stage movements on the veins. An age of 1820 [plus or minus] 30 million years is assigned to a granitic rock at Port Radium {{on the basis of the}} lead-uranium isotopic analyses of seven zircon fractions. This sets a lower limit on the age of the Echo Bay and Cameron Bay groups and an upper limit on the age of Hornby Bay group and diabase dykes. In the zircon fractions, uranium and radiogenic lead concentrations increase with decreasing average grain size. All fractions show the discordant age pattern Pb [superscript 206]/U[superscript 238] < Pb [superscript 207]/U[superscript 235] < Pb[superscript 207]/Pb[superscript 206]. On a "Concordia" diagram, points representing the different zircon fractions define a chord intersecting the Concordia curve at 1815 and 50 million years. Microscopic and macroscopic samples of three pitchblende specimens from the Port Radium mine were analysed isotopically for lead and uranium. For a specimen of pitchblende in carbonate gangue, concordant lead-uranium ages were obtained on two microscopic samples. The age, 1445 [plus or minus] 20 million years, is the only concordant age which has been measured for the Port Radium ores. It places a lower limit on the age of the "giant quartz veins", the diabase dykes, and possibly the Hornby Bay group, and an upper limit on the diabase sills. For a specimen of pitchblende in siliceous gangue, two analyses define a chord intersecting the Concordia curve at 1450 and 300 million years. In general, Port Radium pitchblende samples show evidence of past loss of lead; the lead was removed from the vein systems. Comparison of isotopic data on microscopic and macroscopic samples from the same specimen shows that the microscopic samples can be less discordant and have higher lead-lead ages. Analyses of a number of lead-uranium systems in the same specimen offers a possible means of determining the age of mineralization and the age of an episodic disturbance. Of eight samples of galena and one of chalcopyrite analysed isotopically for lead, three are ordinary lead, four J-type anomalous lead and two possibly mixtures of ordinary lead and radiogenic uranium lead derived from the pitchblende. The ordinary lead is finely disseminated through the other vein minerals and was probably introduced shortly after the pitchblende. The J-type lead occurs in late, lenticular veinlets and was not formed by mixing with radiogenic lead from the pitchblende ores. Because of the absence of mixing and because of considerations concerning the geochemical character of the source system for the J-type lead, this lead was probably introduced less than 300 million years ago. Disturbances to the lead-uranium systems of the zircon and pitchblende samples provide further isotopic evidence for processes probably active within the last 200 - 300 million years but not recognized on the basis of geological field data. Additional isotopic work to confirm and elaborate on these interpretations is suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{workshops}} {{taken at}} the SFU Summer School were all very good and, for the most part, very applicable to my job at AU as a communication officer/writer. Six of the seven courses were equally useful for writing as they were for editing. Each successive course built on the previous ones. There was usually some useful review {{at the beginning of}} each course. The first course was Copyediting and Proofreading. The instructor was Ruth Wilson. Copyediting comes after the substantive edit (re-writing and organizing major parts of a document) and, as such, deals primarily with correcting grammar and usage. Much of the class covered elements of grammar such as spelling, hyphenation, capitalization, number styles, punctuation, wordiness, common writing errors (and non-errors), usage, and also samples of style sheets and how to develop them. Much of this information would be repeated in subsequent courses and this served as an excellent introduction. We learned proper editing and proofreading symbols as well as a useful list of frequently misspelled words. In this course there was a great deal of discussion of the role and responsibility of the editor and how much (and how) the editor might change the writer’s work. The proofreading section dealt with the nuts and bolts required for proofreading (style sheet, quiet, concentration, good light, printed copy of document, ruler, dictionary, style guide) and the kinds of elements to look for in the first, second and third edits. We were also introduced to “Professional Editorials Standards” (2009) from the Editors’ Association of Canada (EAC). The next five courses were of the greatest use to me as a writer and as an editor. The courses included grammar, punctuation and mechanics, usage, style and syntax, all of which are related. This provided more review of grammar and application. The instructor for the grammar course was Vlad Konieczny. In any grammar course there is always something new and some review, as was the case here. My general difficulty with grammar is that while I (usually) know when something is correct or incorrect, I often don’t know the grammatical basis for it; I cannot analyze the sentence. While that is fine as a writer, as an editor, if I’m going to change someone else’s material, I should be able to justify or explain why I’m doing it. This was a very helpful course. The instructor for the next four courses, Frances Peck, is a very knowledgeable and experienced editor and writer. She has an excellent idea of how to apply the material for professional writers and editors. She stressed the importance of consistency. A number of uses, spellings, and style issues were covered which can be correctly handled in a number of different ways. She said the important thing is to choose a style and use it consistently. It is important for an institution, writer, or editor to develop a style sheet (either for the institution or for the particular project) which outlines what style and spellings have been used and the reference material that has been used. I also learned the importance of referring to good style and usage guides such as Fowler’s Modern English Usage and the Chicago Style Guide (Communication and Creative Services at AU uses the Canadian Press Style Guide but the Chicago Style Guide is much more comprehensive.) Usage is the correct application of grammar, how to use the elements of language, and how usage changes over time, such as; -Do not use “action” as a verb as in; It is imperative that you action these items as soon as possible. -You can possibly use (i. e. acceptance is in transition) “access” as a verb as in; You can access the full range of services here. -You can now use “liaise” as a verb (meaning to interact or communicate with) as in; Diane will liaise with the department on this project. The grammar course reviewed accurate usage, commonly misused and confused words and phrases (such as full and fulsome, historic and historical, intense and intensive) and myths, such as never starting a sentence with because and as being more correct than like. As with all of Peck’s classes, exercises were used as the basis for teaching and discussion. Punctuation and mechanics deals with interpretation (punctuation) and esthetics (mechanics). The course started with grammar: parts of speech; clauses and phrases; commas (when superfluous and when needed); comma splices; semicolons; colons; lists; italics; quotation marks; hyphens and dashes (em dashes and en dashes); and apostrophes. Style started with a quick grammar review and defining the steps in the writing process. The course covered consistency (in verb tense, in voice, in person and number, in style or tone), parallelism, flow, transitions, verbs, sentence length and structure, coordination and subordination, passive and active voice, and conciseness. Syntax is the word order within a sentence and the meaning that resides in the way the subject and verb are combined with other words and phrases. Some aspects covered were; the inverted sentence; passive and active voice; rhythm and sentence length, sentence openings, sentence type; <b>flow</b> and content; <b>echo</b> words; emphasis; and special techniques such as isolation and ellipses. Breaking down the various aspects of writing this way was very helpful to isolate and concentrate on one subject at a time. By the end of these five courses, a good review had taken place and a solid foundation had been developed. The last course, Developmental Editing, was the least useful only because it is not something I will ever do. I thought developmental editing was the same things as substantive editing but it is not. In developmental editing, the editor works with a subject matter expert who is not a strong writer and guides them through the writing process. Nonetheless, the instructor, Joy Gugeler, was very knowledgeable and experienced. The discussion of structure, style and organization was helpful to some extent in terms of writing. The discussion of particular books and elements such as plot, character, narrative, genre, etc., was very interesting from a reader’s point of view. In all of the courses, there were a number of good resources (print and online) recommended which will provide excellent reference material. Follow up for me will include the following: -Develop a style sheet which I will use consistently for my writing and which could be used as the basis of a style sheet for the department and/or university; -Organize the material from these courses into some format for easy reference (perhaps alphabetical list or subject matter list); -Purchase some of the resource material for the office; -Find ways to continue to improve my familiarity and knowledge of grammar and my knowledge of available grammar resources. Copy Editing and Proofreading: (2 days) This two-day workshop is ideal for anyone wanting an introduction to the world of publishing or communications, or for anyone currently called upon to improve the writing of others in their organization. The class incorporates group discussion and hands-on exercises while covering the following topics: editing marks; copyeditor’s responsibilities; finding and noting mistakes in spelling, punctuation, and grammar; striving for consistency; preparing style sheets; proofreading marks; the proofreader’s responsibilities; the proofreading process; technology and proofreading. Fundamentals of Grammar: (1 day) One of the best ways to increase confidence as a writer or editor is to gain a good command of grammar. If you find yourself occasionally confused by participles and gerunds, puzzled by dangling and squinting modifiers, and confounded by which and that or who and whom, this one-day workshop is for you. You will spend the morning reviewing the parts of speech, as well as phrases and clauses, punctuation, and sentence structure. The afternoon will be devoted to analyzing and correcting common errors. Punctuation and Mechanics: (1 day) Anyone who has agonized over a comma or a hyphen knows how tricky the details of punctuation and mechanics can be. We’ll take a systematic approach to the troublesome areas of punctuation and mechanics, focusing on commas (always the source of debate), semicolons, colons, bullet points, quotation marks, italics, apostrophes, and dashes (em and en). We’ll cover the most recent rules, discuss when more than one approach might be correct, and examine the leading style guides. Be prepared to practice, and bring along your most challenging questions. Punctuation and Mechanics will benefit editors and writers who need a refresher on the tricky areas of punctuation and mechanics. Usage Woes and Myths: (1 day) Word usage is an ever-changing area. First it’s wrong to use impact as a verb; then it’s okay. The distinction between fewer and less seems clear, but specific examples make you hesitate. You wonder about debated words such as hopefully and presently, and confusing words such as may and might. You’ve heard that you should never start a sentence with however, but, or because, but you’re not sure. If you are intent on preventing (not avoiding) word errors and avoiding (not preventing) usage myths, this workshop will help. Through discussion, examples, and exercises, we will review some of the most contentious points of English usage. Come prepared with your own usage questions and examples to share with the group. Usage Woes and Myths will benefit editors and writers who need an intensive review of recent changes and errors in word usage. Clear and Concise - Guidelines for Style: (1 day) Clear, concise writing may seem like the product of magic, instinct, or luck, but the pros know that it’s the result of learned techniques. This workshop covers tried-and-true revision techniques that improve consistency, clarity, flow, and conciseness. We’ll identify and eliminate shifts, link ideas using parallelism and subordination, trim wordy structures, and unearth the power of verbs. Through discussion, examples, and exercises, you’ll amass an arsenal of methods for making every word count. Clear and Concise will benefit writers and editors who want to know the best practical techniques for streamlining prose. The Secrets of Syntax: (1 day) This workshop looks at syntax from various angles, including how to shape it for different documents and audiences. Topics include subordination and coordination, periodic versus cumulative sentences, proximity of subject and verb, echo words, and special techniques such as ellipsis and isolation.  The Secrets of Syntax will benefit writers and editors who want a more systematic understanding of how reshaping language can make it clearer and more powerful. Developmental Editing for Fiction and Non-fiction: (2 days) This two-day workshop will demonstrate how assessment criteria, a survey of alternative options, market research, and some astute analysis can turn a half-baked idea into a fully cooked work that reaches readers. Using examples taken from students’ own works and before-and-after demos of real books and edits, you will be able to see how to apply judgment and new skills to the work at hand...|$|R
