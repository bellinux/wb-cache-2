Holmes' lights were sold under various Trade names: The Handyman's Light for lifebuoys; the Manwell-Holmes Marine Light distress light for merchant vessels; and a modified Handyman Light <b>for</b> <b>lifebuoys</b> for the Admiralty. They also produced a distress signal, the Deck Flare. They were all charged with calcium carbide, it produced acetylene gas when water was dripped onto it. They {{also included a}} small quantity of calcium phosphide, which in contact with water produced impure phosphine, it spontaneously ignited, thereby igniting the acetylene.|$|E

5000|$|To {{manufacture}} the new equipment, Northey {{set up the}} Diaphone Signal Co. at Toronto in 1903. It manufactured a {{range of}} diaphone models: the large [...] "Type F", which created a tone of about 250 Hz, found worldwide use as a fog signal, especially in lighthouses. The mechanism of the diaphone created a noticeable low-frequency [...] "grunt" [...] {{at the end of}} each note produced, caused by the piston decelerating as the air supply was cut. As this low-frequency sound could carry further, Northey's son Rodney redesigned the [...] "Type F" [...] model to sustain the second low tone, creating the familiar two-tone fog signal, commonly used in lighthouses and lightvessels in the United States and Canada (as well as in a famous series of radio commercials <b>for</b> <b>Lifebuoy</b> soap). This version, known as the [...] "Improved Type F" [...] or later as the [...] "F2T", was particularly common in installations on the West Coast of the United States and in lightvessels.

This is the dread sound which means 'man overboard,' and draws to his post every man on the ship, waking or sleeping.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} to {{determine}} the effectiveness of line extension strategies on brand sales performance with reference to Unilever Zimbabwe Harare branch. The research was centered on Unileverâ€™s most recent line extensions <b>for</b> its <b>Lifebuoy</b> and Vaseline brands. The objective of the {{study was to}} establish the impact of introducing a new flavor or variant on brand sales, to determine the effectiveness of new formulation on repeat purchases and to measure the effect of new packaging on brand sales. The main sources of data used in the research are primary and secondary data. Two research designs were used which are explorative and descriptive research designs. A sample size of 100 respondents was used. The sample frame consisted of management, employees, and customers. Probability sampling was used to select the targeted respondents, there after stratified sampling and simple random sampling were used respectively. Questionnaires were administered to customers and employees, for management interviews were conducted. The results of the research tools indicated that line extensions in the form of new flavor and formulation were most successful in increasing sales and customers. The study also showed that line extensions in the form of new packaging did not positively impact brand sales. The study concluded that line extension strategies in the form of a new flavor or formulation had resulted in an increase in sales and customer base for Unilever Zimbabwe. This further lead to an increase in profitability, market share and brand awareness. Findings from data collection showed that customers liked the new flavor Lifebuoy lemon fresh and the improved formulation for the brand. However some customers indicated that they still viewed Vaseline as a less premium brand as compared to Nivea one of its major competitors. The researcher recommended that Unilever need to fully understand its target market and conduct competitor analysis to fully understand why its target market for Vaseline still prefer purchasing other brand and are not loyal to the companyâ€™s brand. Unilever also needs to introduce more flavors <b>for</b> its <b>Lifebuoy</b> brand as competitor brands a still offering a wider portfolio as compared to their own product portfolio. Celebrity endorsements and competitor analysis are further areas of study and are very vital in todayâ€™s hyper competitive environment and helps establish a competitive edge for an organization...|$|R

40|$|Pumice is a {{volcanic}} igneous rock which forms when magma with extremely {{high levels of}} water and gases is violently ejected from a volcano (in an explosive eruption), cools and depressurizes quickly and simultaneously above the ground. It is typically light colored, composed of volcanic glass, {{may or may not}} contain crystals, and commonly originated from high-silica (felsic) to intermediate magmas. Pumice commonly has vesicular or foamy (porous) texture and very low density, so it is enough for it to become the only rock that can float in water. In this study, pumice is for the first time exposed to see its potential as a new and alternative material to produce floating devices and buoy products. This rock is cut and shaped to become some products, such as surfing boards and lifebuoys. Different from other types of the same kind products that are mostly made of heavy materials, such as plastic (polyethylene), rubber, and fibreglass, pumice-based products are lighter, stronger, more buoyant, more durable, resistant, friendly to users and environmental as well as unique in appearance. Potential markets and customers of these products among others are sport and safety equipments traders and marine transportation (such as ship and ferry) companies. People can use pumice-based surfing boards personally for surfing activity and pumice-based <b>lifebuoys</b> <b>for</b> swimming especially for babies and kids...|$|R
40|$|Internet and new {{communication}} {{technologies have}} drastically {{changed the way}} we send and receive messages, changing also the professions engaged in the gathering and diffusion of information. The Internet is by many presumed to have had a democratising effect on journalism, as {{it can be used to}} spread counter-hegemonic information and dismantle false objectivity (Castells, 2009, Rodriguez 2012). In this thesis, I examine this assumption by targeting one example of alternative journalism practice online. Through a case study of Paraguayan independent news site E’a, the thesis investigates how digital media affects newsroom structures and organisation as well as the role and objectives of the journalists. Previous theories and research on old and new alternative media, offered by scholars such as Susan Forde, Chris Atton, Leah A. Lievrouw, Olga Guedes Bailey, Bart Cammaerts and Nico Carpentier, are set against the voices of the practitioners producing E’a in this qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews. The thesis comes to the conclusion, that the Internet brings both benefits and drawbacks in the case of E’a. As a cheap way of publishing news, the digital platform serves as a <b>lifebuoy</b> <b>for</b> a project with a very limited commercial base. But the low Internet access in the country (and therefore presumed low impact of the project) and the change in organizational structure (web journalism resulting in a less collaborative form of working) leave the majority of the practitioners with network pessimism and a growing desire offline. Potential future research could look closer at alternative newscontent online, how it is perceived by the readers, as well as group dynamics and gendered participation in the digital era...|$|R
