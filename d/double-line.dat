40|$|We {{present the}} spectroscopic orbit {{solutions}} of three <b>double-lines</b> eclipsing binaries, BG Ind, IM Mon and RS Sgr. The first precise radial velocities (RVs) {{of the components}} were determined using high resolution echelle spectra obtained at Mt. John University Observatory in New Zealand. The RVs {{of the components of}} BG Ind and RS Sgr were measured using Gaussian fittings to the selected spectral lines, whereas two-dimensional cross-correlation technique was preferred to determine the RVs of IM Mon since it has relatively short orbital period among the other targets and so blending of the lines is more effective. For all systems, the Keplerian orbital solution was used during the analysis and also circular orbit was adopted because the eccentricities for all targets were found to be negligible. The first precise orbit analysis of these systems gives the mass ratios of the systems as 0. 894, 0. 606 and 0. 325, respectively for BG Ind, IM Mon and RS Sgr. Comparison of the mass ratio values, orbital sizes and minimum masses of the components of the systems indicates that all systems should have different physical, dynamical and probable evolutionary status.

25|$|This first Washington-Franklin issue {{appeared}} with gauge 12 perforation and was printed on paper having a <b>double-line</b> watermark {{consisting of the}} letters USPS embedded in the fibers. This particular watermark had large double-lined letters which often weakened the sheets of stamps, causing the frequent separation of stamps at the Post Office before they even reached the customers. As a result, the <b>double-line</b> watermark was discontinued in 1910 and replaced by a single line watermark with smaller letters. Because of the high demand for the one and two cents denominations, these issues were also printed in , with six stamps to a page.|$|E
25|$|However, in Durrës the Byzantine rite {{continued}} to exist for a while after Angevin conquest. This <b>double-line</b> of authority created some confusion in the local population and a contemporary visitor of the country described Albanians as nor they are entirely Catholic or entirely schismatic. In order to fight this religious ambiguity, in 1304, Dominicans were ordered by Pope Benedict XI to enter the country and to instruct the locals in the Latin rite.

25|$|A {{successful}} ramming {{was difficult}} to achieve; {{just the right amount}} of speed and precise maneuvering were required. Fleets that did not have well-drilled, experienced oarsmen and skilled commanders relied more on boarding with superior infantry (such as increasing the complement to 40 soldiers). Ramming attempts were countered by keeping the bow towards the enemy until the enemy crew tired, and then attempting to board as quickly as possible. A <b>double-line</b> formation could be used to achieve a breakthrough by engaging the first line and then rushing the rearguard in to take advantage of weak spots in the enemy's defense. This required superiority in numbers, though, since a shorter front risked being flanked or surrounded.|$|E
40|$|The {{mass of the}} pseudoscalar meson in Nambu's {{model is}} calculated. The {{principle}} of the approximation is that the arguments concerning to {{the mass of the}} meson must include the possible effective four boson interactions. It is shown that a pseudoscalar meson of non-zero mass is generated dynamically in the model which has been thought to be massless. In a previous note/l it was shown that a pseudoscalar field without bare mass, A, can have non-zero physical mass when an interaction of the type- AA 4 is taken into account, if J. >O and the mass of nucleon is not zero, although single nucleon-meson interaction cannot give meson field any finite mass. In other words, it is essential to include possible four boson interaction when we discuss the boson mass. On the other hand, Y. Nambu and G. Jona-LasinioC 2 l showed in their model that a massless pseudoscalar meson is generated as a counter contribution of non-zero physical mass of the nucleon. However, their argument based on the conserved ·current is very questionable. Their second argument is that the homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter. equation for a particle-anti-particle system has a solution corresponding to a massless pseudoscalar field if it is approximated by the ladder diagram of nucleon bubbles. They also showed, by the same procedure, that there are a scalar meson and a scalar deuteron. The purpose. of this note is to clarify the discrepancy between the treatment by Nambu-Jona Lasinio and our previous results. If bosons are interpreted as bound states, there may be the effective four bosons interactions as shown in Fig. 1, where wavy-, dashed- and <b>double-lines</b> represent the pseudoscalar meson, scalar one and the scalar deuteron respectively. So, by the previous arguments, to discuss the mass of the pseudoscalar meson (a...|$|R

25|$|This {{series is}} again {{perforated}} 12, {{and the values}} between 1¢ and 50¢ are printed on single-line watermarked paper. The 50¢ and $1 issues, however, are instead printed on <b>double-line</b> watermarked paper {{left over from the}} production of the 1908 series. Denominations not included in this printing are the 3, 4, 5 and 6-cent stamps as there were still adequate stocks of these available. Of special interest is the first appearance of the 7-cent Washington-head, with its premier color of black, issued on April 29, 1914. An estimated 5 million 7-cent stamps were printed, a relatively low number for a definitive issue. It was available in post offices for only five months, for this denomination went through a perforation change in the next series, thus making it a new and separate issue.|$|E
25|$|This series again {{includes}} Washington-heads on denominations 1-cent through 7-cents and Franklin-heads on the 8-cent through 1-dollar values. It is {{the first}} series to include the 11-cent denomination with the Franklin and Oak leaves design, colored slate-green, which appears again in the following two series of 1916 and 1917. Lower values of the series are printed from plates of 400 on single-line watermarked paper, while the one-dollar Franklin is printed from plates of 200 subjects and uses <b>double-line</b> watermarked paper of the appropriate size. Because of stamp separation problems in previous issues using gauge 12 perforations, particularly when attempting to tear a block of stamps from the sheet to cover postage on parcels, this series was instead issued with gauge 10. The perforations of this gauge would soon {{prove to be a}} problem also, as the coarser gauge of perforation made it more difficult to separate stamps, often resulting in torn stamps.|$|E

The foundation excavations were extended [...] below the original ground surface to remove liquefaction soils {{that would have made}} the dam unstable in an earthquake. To minimize foundation seepage through the alluvium, [...] thick cut-off walls of plastic concrete were constructed across the three alluvial channels and excavated at least [...] into bedrock. To reduce seepage through the rock foundation, the entire core width was consolidation grouted and a <b>double-line</b> grout curtain was installed to a depth of approximately [...] Grouting of the west dam took about two years to complete and required [...] of grout holes.|$|E

2500|$|The 50-cent and 1-dollar Franklin issues {{made their}} debut on February 12, 1912. These stamps were printed from plates of 200 {{subjects}} {{instead of the}} 400-subject plate used on all lesser denominations. The 200-subject printing plate required paper whose dimensions were compatible with its size and operation. Since there were remaining stocks of <b>double-line</b> watermarked paper from 1908 intended for plates with 200 subjects on hand, this paper was used for these two issues. When stocks of this paper ran out some two years later, new single-line watermarked paper was cut to the proper size and used. Consequently the 50-cent Franklin occurs on two paper-types in this one series. The 1-dollar Franklin was not printed again on this new paper as existing stocks were ample up to 1916. The 50-cents and 1-dollar Franklin & Oak leaves issues occur again in the following three series of the Washington-Franklin Issue. [...] (...) ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{producing}} the 1910–11 series, the Post Office abandoned experiments with paper additives, but took two other measures {{to compensate for}} paper shrinkage. First, the stamp-images on the outer columns of the printing plate were set wider apart (3mm) than those toward the center (2mm). Second, the elaborate <b>double-line</b> watermark—deemed a possible source of uneven paper-shrinkage—was discontinued and replaced by a simpler [...] "single-line" [...] watermark, which, it was hoped, would ensure more uniform shrinkage. In other respects, the 1910–11 series mirrors its predecessors. Like them, it is perforated twelve and it employs the same Franklin- and Washington-head designs. It does not, however, include all the denominations available in earlier issues, but omits the 13c Washington stamp, which had been offered in the two previous series, {{as well as the}} 50c and $1 Washington issues printed in 1908–09. None of these three designs would appear again in subsequent Washington-Franklin series.|$|E
2500|$|As the Bureau {{used only}} {{two types of}} watermarks for the Washington-Franklins, with each type bearing the {{initials}} USPS, their application is easily summarized. There are eight distinct configurations in which the watermarked initials can appear on any U.S. postage stamp (or sheet), from right side up, to sideways right, to upside down, and to sideways left; and similarly again in reverse form {{as a result of}} the sheet of paper being placed reversed in the printing press, thus causing the initials USPS to appear reversed on the stamp/sheet. Watermarks as they occur on U.S. postage stamps are not usually visible to the naked eye and must be submerged in a special watermark fluid that enhances its appearance. This is done to distinguish stamps with the same color, perforation gauge and denomination but which were printed on paper with different watermarks or without any watermarks—i.e., the only way to positively distinguish a 3-cent, 1908 issue, with <b>double-line</b> watermark, from a 3-cent, 1910 issue, with single-line watermark, is to test for these watermarks, as both of these issues are identical in color, denomination and perforation (gauge 12), and therefore cannot be differentiated by these features.
