5|$|Discovered in 1995, the Pyxis {{globular}} cluster is a 13.3 ± 1.3 billion year-old {{globular cluster}} situated around 130,000 light-years <b>distant</b> <b>from</b> Earth and around 133,000 light-years <b>distant</b> <b>from</b> {{the centre of}} the Milky Way—a region not previously thought to contain globular clusters. Located in the galactic halo, it was noted to lie on the same plane as the Large Magellanic Cloud and the possibility has been raised that it might be an escaped object from that galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Three star {{systems have}} {{confirmed}} planets. HD 103774 {{is a young}} yellow-white main-sequence star of apparent magnitude 7.12 that is 181 ± 5 light-years <b>distant</b> <b>from</b> Earth. It is 1.335 ± 0.03 times as massive and 3.5 ± 0.3 as luminous as the Sun. Variations in its radial velocity showed it was being orbited by a Neptune-sized planet every 5.9 days in 2013. HD 104067 is an orange dwarf of spectral type K2V of apparent magnitude 7.93 that is 69 ± 1 light-years <b>distant</b> <b>from</b> Earth. Around 80% as massive as the Sun, it is orbited by a planet 3.6 times the mass of Neptune every 55.8 days. WASP-83 has a planet around as massive as Saturn that orbits it every 5 days. It was discovered by its transit across the star in 2015. A fourth star system has an unconfirmed planet. HD 111031 is a sunlike star of spectral type G5V located 101 ± 2 light-years <b>distant</b> <b>from</b> Earth.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} castle was {{becoming}} less fashionable as a residence. Goodrich was too <b>distant</b> <b>from</b> London to {{be a useful}} power base, and was gradually abandoned in favour of more stylish residences, Goodrich continued {{to be used as}} a judicial centre however; the antiquarian John Leland noted that some of the castle was used to hold prisoners for the local court during the 1530s, and the castle ditch was sometimes used to store confiscated cattle taken from local farmers.|$|E

5|$|Cicero {{stated the}} twins {{objection}} (that with close birth times, personal outcomes {{can be very}} different), later developed by Saint Augustine. He argued that since the other planets are much more <b>distant</b> <b>from</b> the earth than the moon, they could have only very tiny influence compared to the moon's. He also argued that if astrology explains everything about a person's fate, then it wrongly ignores the visible effect of inherited ability and parenting, changes in health worked by medicine, or {{the effects of the}} weather on people.|$|E
5|$|INS Shakti can refuel four ships at a time, with a {{fuelling}} {{speed of}} 1,500 tonnes per hour while her predecessors had {{a speed of}} 300 per hour. She is also equipped with state-of-the art electronics, medical facilities and storage spaces. According to Admiral Nirmal Verma, Shakti would significantly add to the Indian Navy's ability to conduct and sustain operations <b>distant</b> <b>from</b> the coast.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century Richmond and {{neighbouring}} Twickenham on {{the opposite}} bank of the Thames, {{both of which were}} <b>distant</b> <b>from</b> London but enjoyed efficient transport links to the city via the river, became extremely fashionable, and their populations began to grow rapidly. As the ferry was unable to handle large loads and was often cancelled due to weather conditions, the river crossing became a major traffic bottleneck.|$|E

5|$|Iota1 Normae is a {{multiple}} star system. The AB (mag 5.2 and 5.76) pair orbit {{each other with}} a period of 26.9years; they are 2.77 and 2.71times as massive as the Sun respectively. The pair are 128 ± 6light-years <b>distant</b> <b>from</b> Earth. A third component is a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G8V with an apparent magnitude of 8.02.|$|E
5|$|Many popular modern {{accounts}} of the war claim {{that there was a}} factional split in the escaped slaves between those under Spartacus, who wished to escape over the Alps to freedom, and those under Crixus, who wished to stay in southern Italy to continue raiding and plundering. This appears to be an interpretation of events based on the following: the regions that Florus lists as being raided by the slaves include Thurii and Metapontum, which are geographically <b>distant</b> <b>from</b> Nola and Nuceria.|$|E
5|$|Ross 695 is a {{red dwarf}} star located a mere 28.9 ± 0.6 light-years <b>distant</b> <b>from</b> Earth. At {{apparent}} magnitude 11.27, it is much too faint {{to be seen with}} the unaided eye. A small star, it has around 23% the mass and radius of the Sun, but only 0.7% its luminosity. VHS 1256-1257 is a brown dwarf of spectral type M7.5 located 41 ± 3 light-years <b>distant</b> <b>from</b> Earth. Around 73 times as massive as Jupiter, it is just under the mass boundary separating brown dwarves from stars. It has a companion that was first identified and documented by the 2MASS survey in 2015. It orbits at a distance of 102 ± 9 AU and has an estimated mass of approximately 11 times Jupiter's. DENIS-P J1228.2-1547 is a system composed of two brown dwarfs orbiting each other located 73 ± 3 light-years away from Earth. TV Corvi is a dwarf nova composed of a white dwarf and brown dwarf that orbit each other every 90 minutes. The system has a baseline magnitude of 17 that brightens periodically to magnitude 12, discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1931 and David Levy in 1990 and 2005.|$|E

5|$|That {{space is}} {{undergoing}} metric expansion {{is shown by}} direct observational evidence of the Cosmological principle and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely isotropic and homogeneous, supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts {{were the result of}} an explosion from a center <b>distant</b> <b>from</b> us, they would not be so similar in different directions.|$|E

5|$|The {{slightly}} older Two Medicine Formation, home to H. stebingeri, was also populated by another well-known nesting hadrosaur, Maiasaura, {{as well as}} the troodontid Troodon, which is also known from nesting traces. The tyrannosaurid Daspletosaurus, caenagnathid Chirostenotes, dromaeosaurids Bambiraptor and Saurornitholestes, armored dinosaurs Edmontonia, Oohkotokia, and Scolosaurus, hypsilophodont Orodromeus, hadrosaur Prosaurolophus, and horned dinosaurs Achelousaurus, Brachyceratops, Einiosaurus, and Rubeosaurus were also present. This formation was more <b>distant</b> <b>from</b> the Western Interior Seaway, higher and drier, with a more terrestrial influence.|$|E
5|$|Triton {{is unique}} among all large moons in the Solar System for its {{retrograde}} orbit around its planet (i.e. it orbits {{in a direction}} opposite to the planet's rotation). Most of the outer irregular moons of Jupiter and Saturn also have retrograde orbits, as do some of Uranus's outer moons. However, these moons are all much more <b>distant</b> <b>from</b> their primaries, and are small in comparison; the largest of them (Phoebe) has only 8% of the diameter (and 0.03% of the mass) of Triton.|$|E
