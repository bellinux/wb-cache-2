He had not played a tournament since February 2014, but he started the 2015 Apia International Sydney with a straight-sets win against Sergiy Stakhovsky. In the second round, his {{opponent}} was world No. 19 and top seed Fabio Fognini. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> test for del Potro, but he proved to be stronger than the Italian. Del Potro was through to the quarterfinals, but lost to Mikhail Kukushkin in two tiebreakers. After his Sydney campaign, he was drawn to play Jerzy Janowicz {{in the first round of}} the 2015 Australian Open, del Potro withdrew due to his wrist injury. Del Potro played in Miami and was not seen for nearly a year, undergoing surgery again in June 2015.|$|E

He missed the Paris Masters, {{as well as the}} {{important}} French Davis Cup final against Serbia. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> end to the season for Tsonga, as he finished the season outside the top 10 {{for the first time in}} three years, compiled a 31â€“16 win-loss record (his worst tally since 2007), and failed to reach a single final during the season.|$|E
25|$|In the playoffs, the North Stars finally {{defeated}} their rival, the Chicago Black Hawks. Minnesota won {{the series}} 3 games to 2, then eliminated the St. Louis Blues in seven games. Only one team remained between the North Stars' second Stanley Cup Final appearance in four seasons: Wayne Gretzky's Edmonton Oilers. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough,</b> high-scoring series, but Edmonton's star-studded lineup proved {{too much for}} the North Stars, and the Oilers swept Minnesota in four games en route to their first Stanley Cup championship.|$|E

When the team finally returned to RFK, the newly acquired Mullins {{made his first}} start for United and put his new team ahead with a header, but the team surrendered a late tying goal to the visiting Montreal Impact, not long after Montreal's star striker Didier Drogba had been sent off for a dead ball foul.

25|$|In October 1964, Conservative Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home (who {{had only}} been in power for 12 months since the {{resignation}} of Harold Macmillan) called a general election. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> election, but Labour won a narrow majority, gaining 56 seats (a total of 317 to the Conservatives' 304). The new Labour government under Harold Wilson immediately faced economic problems and Wilson acted within his first hours to appoint Callaghan as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The new government {{had to cope with}} a balance of payments deficit and speculative attacks on Sterling. It was the policy of the whole government, and one in which Callaghan concurred, that devaluation should be avoided {{for as long as possible}} and he managed to arrange loans from other central banks and some tax rises to stabilise the economy. Callaghan's time as chancellor was to be during a time of crisis; with high inflation, high unemployment and an unstable economy with a deficit in the budget, a deficit in the balance of import and exports and most importantly conflict over the value of the pound.|$|E

Now, he's going to the All-Star Game." [...] He batted [...]282 with 81 RBI, a drop partly because the Orioles scored 110 fewer runs than the year before. He was the first Oriole other than Eddie Murray since 1979 to lead the team in home runs, with 25.|$|E

500|$|Nelson and {{the band}} {{encountered}} problems in producing {{some aspects of the}} song. According to Champion, [...] "...it was really difficult to record, because it worked at about five or six different tempos. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> choice of choosing which tempo to play, because sometimes it sounded too rushed, and sometimes it sounded as if it was dragging..." [...] The band was trying to get the right tempo, according to Nelson, [...] "because a beat either side of the tempo we picked didn't have the same groove". To improve the song, they recorded this part live and Buckland overdubbed his guitar. They recorded it two or three times until Nelson {{and the band}} were happy at the output. The backing vocals were recorded in the control room of Quadrangle.|$|E

According to Godrich, [...] "I literally left him on a fucking table in my house and went and recorded. And it was a very, very emotional day for me. He was a string player as well so it was one of those things where it felt like he would want me to go and just do this." [...] Around the same period, Yorke announced his separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died of cancer several months after the album's completion. He told Rolling Stone: [...] "There was a lot of difficult stuff going on at the time, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> time for us as people.

500|$|Lo {{found the}} {{shooting}} difficult and exhausting {{because she had}} to walk around with a 22-pound camera strapped around her waist for the three days of the filming. She also stated that it was [...] "draining" [...] to represent the pain she felt when she wrote the track. At one point during the filming, Lo was drunk and tired, so {{she decided to go}} into the bathroom stall; concerning this, the singer confessed that: [...] "I was wasted and tired and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> recording and I really just went into the bathroom and sat there by myself. There weren't any people around then and I was just really alone in that stall. I just sat there and thought of anything that was happening during that time. The tears just came." [...] She also confessed that she barely remembered half of the recording. On 19 February 2014, she posted a teaser of the video on her Facebook account. On 17 March 2014, the music video was released via Lo's VEVO channel on YouTube, and was made available for consumption on the iTunes Store the next day.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} {{of all four}} classes appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. TrÃ©luyer was delighted with the victory, saying: [...] "What a race, <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> lights-to-flag job, just like at Silverstone, but it was huge fun and weâ€™re already looking forward to Le Mans." [...] He further stated: [...] "We did it and I am very happy for the team {{because we had a}} really strong weekend and it feels great to win in this fashion." [...] Lotterer said of the result: [...] "It's no holds barred all the time and is very fun, especially at Spa-Francorchamps. It's for this type of race that we hit track." [...] Dumas, who finished in second alongside Lieb and Jani, stated he found driving in dry weather conditions difficult because he was not experienced participating in such conditions. Lieb said his battle with TrÃ©luyer was [...] "great" [...] and said the contact between the two drivers was part of motor racing. Jani stated while he did not win the race he praised his car. Third-place co-finisher Webber said that his team had [...] "too many own goals" [...] and that they did not wanted to be [...] "gifted results" [...] if they were not performing at the highest level. Bernhard said that despite taking the stop-and-go penalty his team did not give up and gave it their best effort to stand on the podium.|$|E
500|$|Carpenter and {{his crew}} persuaded the city to shut off the {{electricity}} to ten blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. [...] "We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending {{on whether or not}} we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for {{about two and a half}} months I never saw daylight, which was really strange." [...] The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, [...] "That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [...] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape." [...] In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam, in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, to use their futuristic-looking rapid-transit system. In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. [...] "We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble".|$|E

Virus leader Federico Moura's persistent pneumonia fueled rumors of further complications, which ended in the revelation soon after by the singer that he was infected with AIDS. Moura died on December 21, 1988. Moura's passing completed a dreadful trifecta of musicians who had still much to offer. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> blow for rock.

In an interview with the British Daily Mail newspaper in 2012, Faldo said of his Ryder Cup captaincy: [...] "The bottom line is that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> experience and very tough for me to deal with afterwards."
