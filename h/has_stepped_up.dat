25|$|Although it had {{traditionally}} supported Burma's pro-democracy {{movement for}} many years, India's policy changed in 1993, making friendly overtures {{to the military}} junta. India signed trade agreements and increased its investments in Burma; although private sector activity remains low, India's state corporations have landed lucrative contracts for industrial projects {{and the construction of}} major roads and highways, pipelines and upgrading of ports. India has also increased its competition with China over the harnessing of Burma's significant oil and natural gas reserves, seeking to establish a major and stable source of energy for its growing domestic needs, countering Chinese monopoly over Burmese resources and reducing dependence on oil-rich Middle Eastern nations. Although China remains Burma's largest military supplier, India has offered to train Burma's military personnel and has sought their cooperation in curbing separatist militants and the heavy drug trafficking affecting much of Northeast India. China's winning of contracts harnessing more than 2.88–3.56 trillion cubits of natural gas in the A-1 Shwe field in the Rakhine State and development of naval and surveillance installations along Burma's coast and the Coco Islands has provoked great concern and anxiety in India, which <b>has</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> its investment in port development, energy, transport and military sectors.|$|E
500|$|After {{losing the}} World Series {{in six games}} to the Boston Red Sox, Matheny and general manager John Mozeliak {{explained}} that Miller's role was as [...] "insurance." [...] In just one game until Michael Wacha's final start– which was {{the final game of}} the year– did a starter go less than five innings. [...] Miller also became less effective as the season progressed late, with his strikeout rate decreasing and walk rate increasing. [...] Said Matheny, [...] "It {{would have to be a}} situation where we were pushing into a tight spot, and that's just not fair to him without having much action to this point. [...] He's been exactly what we’ve needed up to this point. [...] Fortunately we haven’t needed that long outing." [...] Mozeliak added that [...] "second-guessing the roster doesn’t have traction. [...] His role was always that insurance. [...] There were a lot of question marks as we were going into this on exactly how our rotation was going to unfold. [...] The fact that everybody <b>has</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> changed the dynamic." ...|$|E

Eslamain wrote, [...] "It seems that the University of Oxford <b>has</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> involvement in a politically motivated campaign which is not only in sharp contract with its academic objectives, but also is linked with a chain of events in post-Iranian presidential elections blamed for British interference both at home and abroad". [...] The letter also said that the [...] "decision to abuse Neda's case to establish a graduate scholarship will highly politicise your academic institution, undermining your scientific credibility – along with British press which made exceptionally a lot of hue and cry on Neda's death – will make Oxford at odd [...] {{with the rest of the}} world's academic institutions". Eslamain asked for the university's governing board to be informed of [...] "the Iranian views", and finished by saying, [...] "Surely, your steps to achieve your attractions through non-politically supported programmes can better heal the wounds of her family and her nation".|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, {{reporting}} by Gordon and Judith Miller {{played a key}} role in raising public support for the Iraq War.

[...] Anonymous [...] "American officials" [...] and [...] "intelligence experts" [...] are the only sources. Following Miller's later refusal to reveal her source in the [...] "outing" [...] of C.I.A. officer Valerie Plame, the Times reporter spent 85 days in jail and was later released from the newspaper. The decision to release Miller also involved the controversy over the bias of her joint reporting with Gordon regarding Iraq's nuclear intentions and the Bush administration. Despite his joint involvement in the controversy, Gordon remains the chief military correspondent for The New York Times.|$|E
2500|$|While guitars {{have been}} (minimally) present {{even in their}} early work, their {{appearance}} in the final mix has always been very slight, and even today that Chaplin <b>has</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> as an almost full-time guitarist in the band, that instrument is never featured as prominently as {{to be more than}} barely noticed. For this matter, they have been dubbed as [...] "the band with no guitars", thanks to their heavily piano-based sound. By using delay and distortion effects on their pianos and similar keyboards, they often create sounds that aren't immediately recognisable as piano. Rice-Oxley said during an interview in Los Angeles that they tend to think piano-related music is boring and what they really wanted to do was try something different. He referred to the piano as an odd instrument to form part of a rock band instrumentation, comparing it to The Beatles' set of instruments. Rice-Oxley's distortion piano has been key to most of Keane's multifaceted style and most definitely their most recognizable asset.|$|E

2500|$|While India has {{remained}} a staunch supporter of the [...] "One China" [...] policy and recognised the People's Republic of China on the mainland over the Republic of China authorities on Taiwan, it has, nevertheless, pursued a policy of increasing engagement with the island.

Driven {{by the fact that}} more than 50% of India's trade passes through the Malacca Strait, the Indian navy has established a Far Eastern Naval Command off Port Blair on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. India has also been conducting joint naval exercises with Singapore (SIMBEX) since 1993, with Vietnam in 2000 and has engaged in joint patrols with Indonesia in the Andaman Sea since 2002.

2500|$|By far, {{the worst}} {{disruption}} {{to the park}} has been caused by autumn-olive which easily colonized the grasslands and deciduous under-story of {{all parts of the}} preserve—and particularly the steep hillsides of the Northern Range. Eradication of this autumn-olive is difficult because of the extremely dense thickets in which autumn-olive grows, the countless blunt thorns found on all areas of the plant, and the sometimes extremely steep topography on which it grows. [...] Despite the difficulties, in October and November 2015, the Trexler Nature Preserve <b>has</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> efforts to mechanically clear hundreds of acres of autumn-olive from the northern range. [...] This effort requires a pair bulldozers equipped with a mechanical grinder that slowly make their way up and down the steep hills grinding and pulverizing the thorny, bush like autumn-olive into rough mulch. [...] The result is large swaths of the northern range that, as of, November 2015 are entirely denuded of vegetation. In spring 2016, the Preserve intends to use chemical herbicides to ensure that the autumn-olive has been eradicated and then replant native grasses and wildflowers to reestablish the unique rolling grasslands characteristic of the Preserve. [...] The eradication efforts were funded {{by a grant from the}} Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program.|$|E
2500|$|The September 11 {{attacks in}} 2001, {{which led to}} the Patriot Act in the US and similar {{legislation}} worldwide, led to a new emphasis on money laundering laws to combat terrorism financing. The Group of Seven (G7) nations used the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering to put pressure on governments around the world to increase surveillance and monitoring of financial transactions and share this information between countries. [...] Starting in 2002, governments around the world upgraded money laundering laws and surveillance and monitoring systems of financial transactions. [...] Anti money laundering regulations have become a much larger burden for financial institutions and enforcement <b>has</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> significantly. During 2011–2015 a number of major banks faced ever-increasing fines for breaches of money laundering regulations. This included HSBC, which was fined $1.9 billion in December 2012, and BNP Paribas, which was fined $8.9 billion in July 2014 by the US government. [...] Many countries introduced or strengthened border controls on the amount of cash that can be carried and introduced central transaction reporting systems where all financial institutions have to report all financial transactions electronically. [...] For example, in 2006, Australia set up the AUSTRAC system and required the reporting of all financial transactions.|$|E

However, he also felt that Jung still faced shortcomings in his compositions, describing that the refrains to his songs [...] "walk a thin line between the familiar and the predictable". He concluded that Jung reasonably demonstrated his [...] "versatility as a melody maker". Writing for Singapore-based radio station MeRadio, Priscilla Wu rated the album four out of five stars and felt that the album exceeded expectations. She described the album as [...] "largely easy on the ears", citing the familiarity between One Fine Day and the pop rock sound of CNBLUE. Noting both the lighter and heavier tracks within the album, Wu stated that Jung's [...] "gentle but warm delivery creates the cohesiveness that gels the album together", which [...] "competently reflects his talent as a singer-songwriter".|$|E
