2500|$|Reading Abraham's request in [...] "What if ten {{shall be}} found there?" [...] a Midrash asked, why ten (and not fewer)? The Midrash answered, {{so that there}} might be enough for a minyan of righteous people to pray on behalf of all of the people of Sodom. Alternatively, the Midrash said, because at the {{generation}} of the Flood, eight righteous people remained (in Noah and his family) and God did not give the world respite for their sake. Alternatively, the Midrash said, because Lot thought that there were ten righteous people in Sodom — namely Lot, his wife, his four daughters, and his four sons-in-law (but Lot was apparently mistaken in thinking them righteous). Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon and Rabbi Hanin in Rabbi Johanan's name said that ten were required for Sodom, but for Jerusalem even one would have sufficed, as [...] says, [...] "Run to and fro in the streets of Jerusalem... and seek... <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> man, if there be any who does justly... and I will pardon her." [...] And thus [...] says, [...] "Adding one thing to another, to find out the account." [...] Rabbi Isaac explained that an account can be extended as far as one man for one city. And thus if one righteous person {{can be found in a}} city, it can be saved in the merit of that righteous person.|$|E
