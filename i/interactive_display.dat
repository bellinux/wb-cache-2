30|$|Using {{the various}} {{affordances}} of <b>interactive</b> <b>displays</b> via gameful applications opens new avenues for enhancing students’ mental exercise, fantasy, creativity, and communication; however, gamifying a “traditional” informal learning activity (e.g. museum visit) by exploiting <b>interactive</b> <b>displays</b> affordances, entails numerous design and development challenges (Cassell 2001; Giannakos et al., 2014; Klopfer et al., 2005). Notably, {{there is little}} evidence in the literature that clearly explains models allowing designers, developers and educators to create and put into practice engaging and efficient gameful activities on <b>interactive</b> <b>displays.</b>|$|R

Large <b>interactive</b> <b>displays</b> are now available through several vendors and many learning applications have emerged. Informal learning environments, like museums, science centers and aquariums, have received particular attention from the education research community, as supporting social interaction and collaboration is highly related with learning and engagement in informal environments (Giannakos et al., 2014). Several studies have established that <b>interactive</b> <b>displays</b> have the potential to engage students in meaningful collaborative learning, especially during an informal learning visit (Antle et al., 2011; Rick & Rogers, 2008).|$|R
25|$|The World Rugby Union Museum is {{a museum}} located in Twickenham Stadium. The museum covers {{the whole of}} the global game, not just English rugby union. It tells the history of the sport, {{including}} William Webb Ellis and Richard Lindon, using <b>interactive</b> <b>display</b> techniques. The museum has a rolling programme of special exhibitions which cover topical issues and offer an opportunity to display some of the obscurer items in the collection. Some unique displays include an English rugby union jersey from the first ever rugby union international in 1871 between England and Scotland, and (until 2005) the William Webb Ellis Cup which was obtained by England at the 2003 Rugby World Cup. Twickenham Stadium Tours are also available through the Museum and run four times per day (Tuesday to Saturday) and twice on Sundays. It is usually open {{every day of the week}} except for Mondays. Except match days when for ticket holders only a special price entry to the museum is available.|$|E
500|$|In 1958, American {{physicist}} William Higinbotham {{worked in}} the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York {{as the head of}} the instrumentation division. Higinbotham had a bachelor's degree in physics from Williams College, and had previously worked as a technician in the physics department at Cornell University while unsuccessfully pursuing a Ph.D. there. He served {{as the head of the}} electronics division of the Manhattan Project from 1943 to 1945, and began working at Brookhaven in 1947, which focused on researching peaceful uses of atomic power. Once a year, the government research facility held an exhibition for the public, with one day each for high school students, college students, and the general public. The exhibition largely consisted of tours and static displays, with some attempts at making displays with [...] "action", so for the 1958 exhibition Higinbotham decided to make an <b>interactive</b> <b>display</b> to entertain the visitors. While reading the instruction manual for one of Brookhaven's computers, a Donner Model 30 analog computer, he learned that the computer could calculate ballistic missile trajectories or a bouncing ball with wind resistance, and he decided to use this ability to form the foundation of a game. He later recalled his intentions were that [...] "it might liven up the place to have a game that people could play, and which could convey the message that our scientific endeavors have relevance for society." ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{systematic}} {{overview of the}} state-of-the art in research {{at the intersection of}} <b>interactive</b> <b>displays</b> and visualization. As the access to and analysis of information is becoming increasingly important anywhere and at any time, researchers have begun to investigate the role of <b>interactive</b> <b>displays</b> as data analysis platforms. Visualization applications {{play a crucial role in}} data analysis and development of dedicated systems and tools for small to large <b>interactive</b> <b>displays</b> to support such application contexts is underway. Researchers have investigated how to support data analysis with visualizations with dedicated interaction modalities such as touch, tangibles, or pens; have developed and studied applications for <b>interactive</b> <b>displays</b> such as tabletops or large wall displays; have studied the support of collaborative analysis around interactive displays; and provided toolkits and guidelines for writing software and designing a technical setup for data analysis with visualizations on <b>interactive</b> <b>displays.</b> We contribute a systematic and quantitative assessment of the literature from 10 different venues, an open repository of papers, and a code-set that can be used to categorize the research space. Our work points out that research has so far largely focused on the development of interaction techniques, for multi-touch tabletop devices, and 2 D spatial and abstract visualizations...|$|R

Opened in 2011 and {{situated}} on the mezzanine level of the South Stand, the 300m² Visitor & Learning Centre is an <b>interactive</b> <b>display</b> charting the history of Warwickshire County Cricket Club and of test match cricket at Edgbaston. The experience is introduced with a five-minute film giving a short overview {{of the history of}} the club and ground in a small theatre area, and includes audio and film records of key moments and figures from Warwickshire's past, and interactive installations demonstrating cricketing techniques and allowing visitors to test their judgement against that of test match umpires. The centre was favourably reviewed by The Independent when it opened in 2011. Commenting on how [...] "the rich history of the club and the ground are told simply, straightforwardly and accessibly", the review concluded by comparing it to the equivalent at Lord's: [...] "The museum at Lord's is cramped and gives an air of scholarly dinginess ... maybe they could learn a lesson or two from Edgbaston now." ...|$|E
