40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an implementation {{of an office}} <b>delivery</b> <b>robot.</b> First, it provides motivation {{for this type of}} project and discusses the abilities a successful <b>delivery</b> <b>robot</b> must possess. Next, the robot used for this project is presented, and its relevant hardware is broken down and explained. Special emphasis is placed on the sensing system, which consists of infrared proximity sensors and incremental optical encoders. The investigation of the hardware is followed by a look into the software side of a <b>delivery</b> <b>robot.</b> This includes the user interface, wireless communication scheme, robot controller, and movement methodology. The core of the thesis follows with a discussion of feature point representation, path planning, and obstacle avoidance. Finally, experimental results are provided, and potential areas for future work are proposed. ii To My Loving Parents iii ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I would not have made it this far without the support and guidance of many people.

40|$|An office <b>delivery</b> <b>robot</b> {{receives}} {{a large amount}} of sensory data and there is uncertainty in its action outcomes. The robot should not only accomplish its goals using environmental information, but also consider various exceptions simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a hybrid system using hierarchical planning of modular behaviour selection networks to generate autonomous behaviour in the office <b>delivery</b> <b>robot.</b> Behaviour selection networks, one of the well-known behaviour-based methods suitable for goal-oriented tasks, are made up of several smaller behaviour modules. Planning is attached to the construct and adjust sequences of the modules by considering the sub-goals, the priority in each task and the user feedback. This helps the robot to quickly react in dynamic situations as well as achieve global goals efficiently. The proposed system is verified with both the Webot simulator and a Khepera II robot that runs in a real office environment carrying out delivery tasks. Experimental results have shown that a robot can achieve goals and generate module sequences successfully even in unpredictable situations. Additionally, the proposed planning method reduced the elapsed time during tasks by 17. 5 % since it adjusts the behaviour module sequences more effectively...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{we develop}} a {{distributed}} mobile robot platform to deliver parts around a model construction site. The platform's <b>robots,</b> specialized into <b>delivery</b> <b>robots</b> and assembly robots, use a distributed coverage algorithm {{to determine where}} parts should be delivered. The robots consist of a mobility platform (iRobot iCreate), a manipulation platform (Crustcrawler arm), and an IR communication system to enable recognition and grasping of parts. To control the robot hardware, we implemented software in Java. The <b>delivery</b> <b>robots</b> use IR communication to find parts at a supply station. After communicating over UDP multicast with assembly station <b>robots,</b> the <b>delivery</b> <b>robots</b> deliver parts to the assembly robots based on their coverage control algorithm. To evaluate the algorithm, we constructed a hardware system of 4 robots, connected to a VICON motion capture system for localization. We discuss the results of successful hardware and software testing of {{the system as a}} method of delivering parts around a construction site, and we discuss future plans to use the platform to assemble parts once delivered. by Adrienne Bolger.

40|$|Navigation {{methods for}} office <b>delivery</b> <b>robots</b> {{need to take}} various sources of {{uncertainty}} into account {{in order to get}} robust performance. In previous work, we developed a reliable navigation technique that uses partially observable Markov models to represent metric, actuator, and sensor uncertainties. This paper describes an algorithm that adjusts the probabilities of the initialMarkov model by passively observing the robot's interactions with its environment. The learned probabilities more accurately reflect the actual uncertainties in the environment, which ultimately leads to improved navigation performance. The algorithm, an extension of the Baum-Welch algorithm, learns without a teacher and addresses the issues of limited memory and the cost of collecting training data. Empirical results show that the algorithm learns good Markov models {{with a small amount of}} training data. 1 Introduction Navigation methods for office <b>delivery</b> <b>robots</b> need to take various sources of uncertainty i [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Agents {{often have}} {{preference}} models {{that are more}} complicated than minimizing the expected execution cost. In this paper, we study how they should act {{in the presence of}} uncertainty and immediate soft deadlines. <b>Delivery</b> <b>robots,</b> for example, are agents that are often confronted with immediate soft deadlines. We introduce the additive and multiplicative planning-task transformations, that are fast representation changes that transform planning tasks with convex exponential utility functions to planning tasks that can be solved with variants of standard deterministic or probabilistic artificial intelligence planners. Advantages of our representation changes include that they are context-insensitive, fast, scale well, allow for optimal and near-optimal planning, and are grounded in utility theory. Thus, while representation changes are often used to make planning more efficient, we use them to extend the functionality of existing planners, resulting in agents with more realistic preference models. ...|$|R

However, no general tools are currently available to aid the development of probabilistic robotic software. This paper presents a programming language extension to C++ that integrates probabilistic computation and learning. Its two main ideas are to make probability distributions as usable as floating-point numbers, and to smoothly integrate function approximators into C++ code. These innovations facilitate the development of robust, probabilistic robot software, as illustrated by a proto-type program for a mail <b>delivery</b> <b>robot.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} {{solution}} that enables robots to operate in long-duration missions with minimal interruption for recharging or refreshing other resources. Consider a set of deployed “task robots ” that request resources (e. g. batteries) from a distribution center, which can deploy “delivery robots” to fulfill those requests. We address the scheduling problem with multiple incoming time-bound requests from the task robots. Our proposed framework incorporates priorities on working robots that can be adjusted by a human operator during scheduling, since mission priorities can change over time. The framework allows a relaxed delivery schedule when available resources are scant and permits dynamic re-routing of <b>delivery</b> <b>robots.</b> The problem is posed as {{a variant of the}} Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows, and solved as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program using a branch and bound based solver. We present the specific case of a battery distribution system and validate the results in simulation. I...|$|R

5000|$|An {{autonomously}} guided robot knows {{at least}} some information about where {{it is and how}} to reach various goals and or waypoints along the way. [...] "Localization" [...] or knowledge of its current location, is calculated by one or more means, using sensors such motor encoders, vision, Stereopsis, lasers and global positioning systems. Positioning systems often use triangulation, relative position and/or Monte-Carlo/Markov localization to determine the location and orientation of the platform, from which it can plan a path to its next waypoint or goal. It can gather sensor readings that are time- and location-stamped. Such robots are often part of the wireless enterprise network, interfaced with other sensing and control systems in the building. For instance, the PatrolBot security robot responds to alarms, operates elevators and notifies the command center when an incident arises.
