2500|$|Two dams in Cuyahoga Falls, the Sheraton and LeFever Dams, were {{scheduled}} for demolition in late 2012. This {{is the result}} of an agreement between the City of Cuyahoga Falls, which owns the dams, and the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District, which will provide $1 million of funding to remove the dams. This schedule was delayed, in part because of complications with the bidding process, and because of requirements from the Army Corps of Engineers. On December 12, 2012, the ACOE issued a permit, allowing the demolition to proceed. As part of the project, a water trail will be developed. In early June 2013, dam removal began, and ended in July 2013. This will bring about a mile of the river back to its natural state, remove 35 feet of structures, and expose an equivalent quantity of whitewater for recreation. [...] As of August 20, 2013, both small dams had effectively been totally removed, and there is essentially no <b>impoundment</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> now.

50|$|The Ouachita creekshell is {{endemic to}} Arkansas and is {{classified}} as a S2 species. This means {{that it is of}} special concern as it is very rare, either having fewer than 20 localities at which it is found or having a small number of individuals at only a very few locations. In either case, it is in danger of extinction. When considering how to conserve the mussel, the management of suitable host fish is important. The chief threat to both is habitat destruction and degradation. The <b>impoundment</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> by damming streams restricts fish movement and causes increased sedimentation below the dam and has a deleterious effect on mussel populations. Competition from the introduced species of mussel, (Corbicula fluminea), may also be a cause for concern.|$|R

40|$|Discharge {{from large}} <b>impoundments</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> {{such as those}} found behind {{hydroelectric}} installations, can have major impacts on downstream water quality. Discharges from surface layers over spillways can significantly improve dissolved oxygen (DO) levels in tailwaters. Conversely, discharges from lower hypolimnetic regions in a reservoir can release anoxic waters whose low DO can result in large-scale environmental damage. A new technology has been developed called the autoventing turbine that aspirates air into hydroelectric turbine discharges in order to substantially improve release DO when it is needed. There {{is a great deal}} of research involved in determining the limits of effectiveness of oxygen transfer through autoventing turbines, and improving the performance of early prototypes. Many preliminary investigations at several different locations failed to reveal a single best design for the autoventing turbine. As a result current research efforts have gone toward designing and testing of turbine models and evaluation of the effectiveness of model runner configurations...|$|R

The aim of this work is to study the surface displacement field during the <b>impoundment</b> <b>of</b> the Itoiz <b>water</b> reservoir, Figure 1. Orbital SAR Differential Interferometry (DInSAR) techniques have been proven to be a useful and powerful tool in tectonic areas for surveying subtle surface deformations over several years related to geodynamic phenomena. An advanced DInSAR observation technique, Coherent Pixel Technique (CPT), has been applied to study the existence of deformation in the dam area in order to obtain mean velocities and time series of deformation. We have studied the applicability of this technique to study the surface displacement field during the <b>impoundment</b> <b>of</b> the Itoiz <b>water</b> reservoir.

40|$|In March 1975, {{personnel}} of the Center for Archaeological Research {{conducted an}} intensive survey of site 41 JW 8 (the Hinojosa site), Jim Wells County, in southern Texas. These investigations {{were the result}} of an agreement between the Center and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soil Conservation Service (SCS) (purchase order no. TX- 1102 - 75). Earlier research at the site had consisted of a preliminary surface survey, the results of which were published by Hester and Bass (1974). In their report, recommendations were made for an intensive survey of the site, to include site mapping, intensive surface collecting, and test excavations. A major objective of this program of investigation was to better evaluate the site in terms of its potential eligibility for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (it was nominated by the State Review Board on January 23, 1976; letter from John W. Clark, Jr. to T. R. Hester).

40|$|Restoration of {{the beaver}} {{population}} (Castor Canadensis) to {{streams and rivers}} is desirable because they are a sustainable and lower cost method of improving stream habitat when compared to human-engineered restoration efforts. Prior {{studies have shown that}} beaver colonization results in <b>impoundments</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> which increase channel width and surface area, increase sediment deposition, and slow flow velocities. While these changes can create a thermally heterogeneous environment promoting diverse aquatic communities and providing thermal refugia, {{there is a need to}} understand the spatial distribution of temperatures and to identify characteristics that produce this variability. To address these needs we developed a process-based temperature model for a beaver pond within Curtis Creek, UT. Using water temperature data distributed spatially within the pond, we delineated model segments into areas with similar temperature responses. This resulted in a main channel area and three surface transient storage (STS) zonesâ€“ one of which was further segmented into two layers where thermal stratification was present. Onsite discharge, water temperature, sediment temperature, channel geometry, and meteorological data provided information for model inputs and calibration. The model formulation accounts for advection, heat fluxes at the air-water interface, lateral exchange between zones, vertical exchange between stratified layers, attenuation of shortwave radiation within the water column, and streambed conduction. The model captured each zoneâ€™s instream and sediment temperatures well and provided information regarding the dominant heat fluxes for each zone. These results can lead to insight regarding key processes and characteristics driving the thermal heterogeneity within beaver ponds over both space and time. Ultimately, this type of modeling approach can aid in future decisions regarding restoring beaver to certain stream systems and the associated ecological implications...|$|R
50|$|Native {{fish species}} in the San Juan River {{reproduce}} during high spring runoff events, which historically would overflow {{the banks of the}} river and spread out into the riparian zone creating off-channel spawning habitat. Since the completion of Navajo Dam, the portion of the San Juan River between the dam and Farmington became unsuitable for native fish due to the reduction in seasonal fluctuations. However, at Farmington the San Juan is joined by the Animas River - which is not controlled by any major dams - and regains some of its seasonal characteristics. In addition, the <b>impoundment</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> at Navajo Dam {{does not appear to have}} a significant effect on the amount of sediment transported in the river; thus, the aquatic environment of the lower San Juan, though somewhat degraded, still resembles pre-development conditions.|$|E
50|$|The bronze darter {{thrives in}} {{freshwater}} and consistently stays in swift waters up to thirty centimeters in depth with partial weedy cover. The substrate in the darter's habitat consists of granulated sand to small gravel covering {{the bottom of}} the water bed. This substrate creates an excellent reservoir for darters to collect food sources in order to maintain life. The darter species are diurnal sight feeders, activity peaking at sunrise and sunset. Over half of their diet consists mainly of chironomids, i.e., water insects. This food source is needed in higher concentrations during the reproductive season. Populations of the bronze darter are stable with no sudden threat from anthropogenic and biological factors. Biological threats to darters include large game fish e.g., Micropterus salmoides (large mouth bass) and crayfish which reluctantly prey on the darters. Anthropogenic concerns to the populations have arisen from <b>impoundment</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and hydropower production. Creating possible threats that can lead to population declines.|$|E

40|$|The South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) {{provides}} the Peruvian Andes with precipitation during the austral summer. Over multidecadal timescales the SASM {{is influenced by}} sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, land-sea temperature gradients, the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) {{and the location of}} the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Decadal to multi-decadal changes in SASM precipitation are documented by Î´ 18 O values of authigenic calcite precipitated from the <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> Lake Junin (11. 0 Â°S, 76. 2 Â°W), which is today a hydrologically open-basin lake system. This sediment record archives calcite-rich sediments that were used to determine the timing and magnitude of regional precipitation changes associated with variability of the SASM. Low Î´ 18 O values provide evidence for a strengthened monsoon system spanning the Little Ice Age (LIA) from AD 1250 to 1600. Following the LIA, higher Î´ 18 O values during the Current Warm Period (CWP) from AD 1850 to present are consistent with a time of decreased monsoon intensity. These data suggest that the SASM is sensitive to changes in the location of the ITCZ, which is influenced by Atlantic tropical SST anomalies controlled by Northern Hemisphere temperatures. The Junin sediment record deviates from other regional paleoclimate records in AD 1932, recording a sharp and sustained decrease of Î´ 18 O values. This event is attributed to the construction of the Upamayo Dam, which resulted in the <b>impoundment</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> from the Rio San Juan in Lake Junin, delivering river waters with low Î´ 18 O meteoric rainwater to the lake. Trace metal data reveals a uniform and sustained enrichment of metal values beginning at 12 cm sediment depth (AD 1932), providing a reliable age-depth correlation between 12 cm depth and the construction of the dam in 1932. This project demonstrates that SASM variability is sensitive to ITCZ location, which is dominantly controlled by Atlantic SST anomalies. This relationship suggests that a continued warming of the north Atlantic will prove to be detrimental to tropical latitudes by reducing precipitation across the region. ...|$|R
40|$|Shannonâ€™s {{diversity}} index Hâ€™ = pi log 2 pi {{was calculated}} for 16 fish species. The index was resolved into its components, species richness and relative abundance, to determine which components played {{a larger role in}} the determination of diversity pattern. Changes in diversity were correlated with species richness (r), habitat heterogeneity, and hydrological regimes in a longitudinal stretch of 35 km along the river Giri, a major tributary of the Yamuna River system, in Western Himalayas. Abundance differs with change in habitat structures, habitat preference of fish species and water regimes. The decrease in diversity in the lower stretch of about 3 - 4 km upstream of the barrage was found to be associated with habitat fragmentation and as well as d/s with loss of biotic integrity of aquatic ecosystem due to water scarcity.
