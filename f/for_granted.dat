5|$|Although the Colorados had {{defected}} to the Flores insurgency, {{the national guard}} continued to support the fusionist government. Blanco partisans filled its depleted ranks. They also replaced army officers who had deserted to Flores. The Blancos received aid from several Argentine Federalists who joined their cause. As in Uruguay, Argentina had long been a battleground of rival parties, and Bartolomé Mitre's victory at Pavón in 1861 had signaled the triumph of his Unitarian Party over the Federal Party led by Justo José de Urquiza. Mitre denied any involvement in the Flores rebellion, even though his complicity was widely known and taken <b>for</b> <b>granted.</b>|$|E

5|$|During an {{excursion}} into Przemysl Land in the 48th {{year of his}} reign, Władysław cought a cold {{from which}} {{he was unable to}} recover. He finally died in Grodek in 1434, leaving Poland to his elder son, Władysław III, and Lithuania to his younger, Casimir, both still minors at the time. The Lithuanian inheritance, however, could not be taken <b>for</b> <b>granted.</b> Władysław's death ended the personal union between the two realms, and it was not clear what would take its place.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} {{that for a}} long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion... But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the freedom offered by the genres, gay {{characters}} often remain contrived and stereotypical, and most SF stories take <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> the continuation of heteronormative institutions. Alternative sexualities have usually been approached allegorically, or by including LGBT characters {{in such a way}} as to not contradict mainstream society's assumptions about gender roles. Works that feature gay characters are more likely to be written by women writers, and to be viewed as being aimed at other women or girls; big-name male writers are less likely to explore gay themes.|$|E

5|$|Indonesia kept East Timor {{shut off}} from the rest of the world, except for a few years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, {{claiming}} that the vast majority of East Timorese supported integration. This position was followed closely by the Indonesian media such that an East Timorese acceptance of their integration with Indonesia was taken <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> by, and was a non-issue for, the majority of Indonesians. East Timor came to be seen as a training ground for the officer corps in tactics of suppression for Aceh and Papua, and was pivotal in ensuring military sector dominance of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Kogălniceanu was a {{democratic}} and nationalist politician who combined liberalism {{with the conservative}} principles acquired during his education, taking inspiration from {{the policies of the}} Prussian statesmen Baron vom und zum Stein and Karl August von Hardenberg.

5|$|Some of {{the local}} beliefs were perhaps less welcome to the {{practitioners}} of organised religion. An each-uisge was thought {{to live in a}} bottomless well near the summit of Macphee’s Hill, and faery sidhes and their associated music were taken <b>for</b> <b>granted,</b> if generally avoided. The curative powers of the seventh son of a seventh son were assumed to be sufficient for the treatment of diseases as serious as tuberculosis. Yet the old ways themselves were dying.|$|E

It takes <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that the Anglo-Saxon laws of England are still in effect. It also addresses the administration of forest law under Henry I.

5|$|Wong {{stated that}} most people take <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> what they possess, and may be without {{identity}} or culture. Wong says his self-awareness, and what Hong Kong represents to him, stem from the years he spent abroad. He says that only by living amidst a second culture can one fully come to realise what one represents and where one belongs. A thread that runs through much of his work is therefore the notion of home, homelessness and wandering. Since 2011, his repertoire {{has taken on a}} political dimension.|$|E
5|$|Eliminativism about a {{class of}} {{entities}} is the view that that class of entities does not exist. For example, materialism tends to be eliminativist about the soul; modern chemists are eliminativist about phlogiston; and modern physicists are eliminativist {{about the existence of}} luminiferous aether. Eliminative materialism is the relatively new (1960s–1970s) idea that certain classes of mental entities that common sense takes <b>for</b> <b>granted,</b> such as beliefs, desires, and the subjective sensation of pain, do not exist. The most common versions are eliminativism about propositional attitudes, as expressed by Paul and Patricia Churchland,and eliminativism about qualia (subjective interpretations about particular instances of subjective experience), as expressed by Daniel Dennett and Georges Rey. These philosophers often appeal to an introspection illusion.|$|E

5|$|His {{expedition}} completed after a {{total of}} 17 months, Beebe and Blair crossed the Pacific to San Francisco, then crossed the United States {{to return to their}} home in New York. Their expedition had obtained live or stuffed specimens of nearly all the pheasants he had sought, and also produced extensive notes about their behavior. Some of these pheasants, such as Sclater's impeyan or Himalayan monal, had never before been seen in the wild by Americans or Europeans. Beebe's observations of sexual dimorphism in pheasants during this expedition led him to become the first biologist to correctly understand the mechanism by which this aspect of sexual selection operates. On the basis of his observations he also proposed a new evolutionary model of pheasant ancestry, involving a period of rapid diversification followed by more typical and gradual changes. Although this evolutionary model is now taken <b>for</b> <b>granted,</b> in William Beebe's time it was a novel idea.|$|E
5|$|His most {{significant}} influence was {{the introduction of}} the idea of wild gardening, which first appeared in The Wild Garden and was further developed in The English Flower Garden. The idea of introducing large drifts of native hardy perennial plants into meadow, woodand, and waterside is taken <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> today, but was revolutionary in Robinson's time. In the first edition, he happily used any plant that could be naturalised, including half-hardy perennials and natives {{from other parts of the}} world—thus Robinson's wild garden was not limited to locally native species. Robinson's own garden at Gravetye was planted on a large scale, but his wild garden idea could be realised in small yards, where the 'garden' is designed to appear to merge into the surrounding woodland or meadow. Robinson's ideas continue to influence gardeners and landscape architects today—from home and cottage gardens to large estate and public gardens.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to similar measures passed in Milwaukee and Chicago, the Minneapolis Fair Employment ordinance gave the city's newly created Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC) authority {{to not only}} impose fines, but also prison sentences for employers who enacted job discrimination. Larger banks and department stores saw the value in civil rights and began to hire more African-Americans. Humphrey also recognized that city police officers operating under racial and ethnic prejudice were causing urban unrest, so he instructed the city's police chief to have officers in minority neighborhoods keep in contact with clergy, teachers, business owners, and other neighborhood leaders. This helped to redefine the issue of prejudice and got its attention as a problem that could be solved, not just {{a fact of life}} that had to be taken <b>for</b> <b>granted.</b>|$|E
