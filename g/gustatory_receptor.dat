[...] He then proceeds to contact her genitalia with his mouth and curve his abdomen to induce copulation. During the early stages of courtship where the male taps the female with his forelegs, males are able to sense the gender and species type of a potential female through the use of non-volatile (i.e. cuticular) pheromones and <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptor</b> neurons (GRNs) located on the males forelegs.

This is especially true for generalists, including chelicerate herbivores that evolved herbivory independently from the more studied insect lineages. To shed light on chemosensory perception in a generalist herbivore, we characterized the chemosensory receptors (CRs) of the chelicerate two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, an extreme generalist. Strikingly, T. urticae has more CRs than reported in any other arthropod to date. Including pseudogenes, 689 <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptors</b> were identified, as were 136 degenerin/Epithelial Na+[*]Channels (ENaCs) that have also been implicated as CRs in insects. The genomic distribution of T. urticae <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptors</b> indicates recurring bursts of lineage-specific proliferations, with the extent of receptor clusters reminiscent of those observed in the CR-rich genomes of vertebrates or C. elegans. Although pseudogenization of many <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptors</b> within clusters suggests relaxed selection, a subset of receptors is expressed. Consistent with functions as CRs, the genomic distribution and expression of ENaCs in lineage-specific T. urticae expansions mirrors that observed for <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptors.</b> The expansion of ENaCs in T. urticae to[*]>[*] 3 -fold that reported in other animals was unexpected, raising the possibility that ENaCs in T. urticae have been co-opted to fulfill a major role performed by unrelated CRs in other animals. More broadly, our findings suggest an elaborate role for chemosensory perception in generalist herbivores that are of key ecological and agricultural importance...|$|R

We recently reported an Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) approach on male antennae of the noctuid moth, Spodoptera littoralis, with which we could identify a large array of chemosensory genes in a species for which no genomic data are available. Here we describe a complementary EST project on female antennae in the same species. 18, 342 ESTs were sequenced and their assembly with our previous male ESTs led to a total of 13, 685 unigenes, greatly improving our description of the S. littoralis antennal transcriptome.

40|$|SummaryCaffeine is a methylxanthine {{present in}} the coffee tree, tea plant, and other {{naturally}} occurring sources and is among the most commonly consumed drugs worldwide. Whereas the pharmacological action of caffeine has been studied extensively, relatively little is known concerning the molecular mechanism through which this substance is detected as a bitter compound. Unlike most tastants, which are detected through cell-surface G protein-coupled receptors, it has been proposed that caffeine and related methylxanthines activate taste-receptor cells through inhibition of a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) [1]. Here, we show that the <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptor</b> Gr 66 a is expressed in the dendrites of Drosophila <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptor</b> neurons and {{is essential for the}} caffeine response. In a behavioral assay, the aversion to caffeine was specifically disrupted in flies missing Gr 66 a. Caffeine-induced action potentials were also eliminated, as was the response to theophylline, the methylxanthine in tea. The Gr 66 a mutant exhibited normal tastant-induced action potentials upon presentation of theobromine, a methylxanthine in cocoa. Given that theobromine and caffeine inhibit PDEs with equal potencies [2, 3], these data further support the role of Gr 66 a rather than a PDE in mediating the caffeine response. Gr 66 a is the first <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptor</b> shown to be essential for caffeine-induced behavior and activity of <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptor</b> cells in vivo...|$|E

In Drosophila, <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptor</b> neurons are located {{at the base of}} the taste sensilla on the labellum, tarsi, and wing margins. One of the <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptor</b> neurons in typical sensilla is known to respond to water. To reveal the neural mechanisms of water perception in Drosophila, it is necessary to identify water receptor neurons and their projection patterns. We used a Gal 4 enhancer trap strain in which GAL 4 is expressed in a single <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptor</b> neuron in each sensillum on the labellum. We investigated the function of these neurons by expressing the upstream activating sequence transgenes, shibirets 1, tetanus toxin light chain, or diphtheria toxin A chain.

The differentiated epithelial cells which form taste buds and the specialized neurons which are the vertebrate olfactory receptors are constantly replaced in normal adult animals, suggesting that chemosensory function per se is damaging to the receptors.

40|$|Evaluation of food {{compounds}} by chemosensory {{cells is}} essential for animals to make appropriate feeding decisions. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, structurally diverse chemicals are detected by multimeric receptors composed of members of a large family of <b>Gustatory</b> <b>receptor</b> (Gr) proteins. Putative sugar and bitter receptors are expressed in distinct subsets of <b>Gustatory</b> <b>Receptor</b> Neurons (GRN) of taste sensilla, thereby assigning distinct taste qualities to sugars and bitter tasting compounds, respectively.

These observations suggest that individual neurons within a taste modality are represented by distinct repertoires of sweet and bitter taste receptors, respectively. Furthermore, we employed this novel method to identify glucose as the primary ligand for the sugar receptor Gr 61 a, which is not only expressed in sweet sensing neurons of classical chemosensory sensilla, but also in two supersensitive neurons of atypical taste sensilla. Thus, single cell Ca 2 + imaging can be employed as a powerful tool to identify ligands for orphan Gr proteins...|$|E
40|$|Although Drosophila melanogaster male {{courtship}} behavior involves multimodal sensory input, non-volatile cuticular hydrocarbons (CHs) on courtship target {{are thought}} to be crucial in both innate courtship behavior (Ferveur and Greenspan, 2000; Jallon and David, 1987) and courtship conditioning (Siwicki et at., 2005). CHs are detected by a fly's peripheral gustatory system that consists of <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptor</b> neurons (GRNs) that express <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptor</b> proteins (Grs) (Amrein and Thorne, 2005; Stocker, 1994). Recently, the first putative pheromone receptor, Gr 68 a, has been identified (Bray and Amrein, 2003). In addition, high sequence similarity to Gr 68 a has implicated Gr 32 a, Gr 39 a. A, and Gr 39 a. D as potential pheromone receptors. In this study, roles of the GRN populations defined by expression of these Grs in innate courtship behavior and courtship conditioning were examined by 1) increasing the neuronal excitability by expression of eagΔ⁹³², a dysfunctional potassium SJ channel subunit protein or by 2) inhibiting neurotransmitter release by expression of shi TS 1 in the specific GRN populations. The results support the previous evidence that Gr 68 a transduces some aphrodisiac pheromone. Furthermore, the results suggest GRN populations defined by expression of Gr 68 a and Gr 39 a.

A single SNP, which results in the Ala 218 Thr amino acid change, {{was significantly associated with}} trehalose sensitivity, as previously suggested. Threonine at amino acid position 218 was found to be the ancestral form in D. melanogaster, suggesting that low trehalose sensitivity was an ancestral form with respect to the receptor function. There was large genetic variation in trehalose sensitivity. It was continuously distributed, indicating that trehalose sensitivity measured by the behavioral assay is a quantitative trait. These results suggest that apart from the Gr 5 a gene, other genetic factors contribute to variation in trehalose sensitivity. Nucleotide diversity (pi) and nucleotide variation (theta) per site were 0. 00874 and 0. 00590, respectively. Fu and Li's test and the MK test showed no significant departure from the expectation of selective neutrality in the Gr 5 a gene.

40|$|Background: The malaria {{mosquito}} Anopheles gambiae {{has a high}} preference for human hosts, a characteristic that contributes greatly to its capacity for transmitting human malaria. A sibling species, An. quadriannulatus, has a quite different host preference and feeds mostly on bovids. For this reason it does not contribute to human malaria transmission. Host seeking in mosquitoes is modulated by the olfactory system, which is primarily housed in the antennae and maxillary palps. Therefore, the detection of differing host odors by sibling species may {{be reflected in the}} expression level of the olfactory genes involved. Accordingly, we compared the transcriptomes of the antennae and maxillary palps of An. gambiae and An. quadriannulatus. Results: We identified seven relatively abundant olfactory receptors, nine ionotropic receptors and three odorant binding proteins that are substantially up-regulated in An. gambiae antennae. Interestingly, we find that the maxillary palps of An. gambiae contain a species-specific olfactory receptor, Or 52, and five An. gambiae-specific <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptors</b> (AgGr 48 - 52) that are relatively abundant. These five <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptors</b> are also expressed in An. gambiae antennae, although at lower level, indicating a likely role in olfaction, rather than gustation. We also document an approximately three-fold higher overall expression of olfaction genes in the maxillary palps of An. quadriannulatus, indicating an important role of this organ in the olfaction system of this species. Finally, the expression of the CO 2 receptor genes is five to six-fold higher in the zoophilic An. quadriannulatus, implying a much higher sensitivity for detecting CO 2. Conclusions: These results identify potential human host preference genes in the malaria vector An. gambiae. Interestingly, species-specific expression of several <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptors</b> in the olfactory organs indicate a role in olfaction rather than gustation. Additionally, a more expansive role for maxillary palps in olfaction is implicated than previously thought, albeit more so in the zoophilic An. quadriannulatus.

In insects, the taste sense relies on gustatory receptors forming the <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptor</b> (Gr) family.

Using a pharmacogenetic approach, we find that flies sense food containing this poison by the DmX receptor. DmXR is an insect orphan G-protein-coupled receptor that has partially diverged in its ligand binding pocket from the metabotropic glutamate receptor family. Blockade of DmXR function with an antagonist lowers the repulsive effect of L-canavanine. In addition, disruption of the DmXR encoding gene, called mangetout (mtt), suppresses the L-canavanine repellent effect. To avoid the ingestion of L-canavanine, DmXR expression is required in bitter-sensitive <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptor</b> neurons, where it triggers the premature retraction of the proboscis, thus leading to the end of food searching.

The bud contains two types of cells, <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptors</b> and sustentacular cells. The receptors are characterized by a dark nucleus and densely granular cytoplasm. The apical processes bear numerous microvilli which extend into the taste pore.

When PSN was stimulated at 30 Hz during generation of taste cell responses, the large amplitude of depolarizing receptor potential for 1 MNaCl and 1 mMacetic acid was depressed by; 40 %by slow HPs, but the small amplitude of the depolarizing receptor potential for 10 mM quinine–HCl (Q-HCl) and 1 M sucrose was completely depressed by slow HPs and furthermore changed to the hyperpolarizing direction. The duration of the depolarizing receptor potentials depressed by slow HPs prolonged with increasing period of PSN stimulation. As tastant-induced depolarizing receptor potentials were increased, the amplitude of PSN-induced slow HPs inhibiting the receptor potentials gradually decreased. The mean reversal potentials of the slow HPs were approximately 1 mV under NaCl and acetic acid stimulations, but approximately 14 mV under Q-HCl and sucrose stimulations. This implies that when a slow HP was evoked on the same amplitude of depolarizing receptor potentials, the depression of the NaCl and acetic acid responses in taste cells was larger than that of Q-HCl and sucrose responses. It is concluded that slow HP–induced depression of gustatory depolarizing receptor potentials derives from the interaction between <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptor</b> current and slow hyperpolarizing current in frog taste cells and that the interaction is stronger for NaCl and acetic acid stimulations than for Q-HCl and sucrose stimulations...|$|E

Results: We find that, prior to their divergence about 1. 5 Mya, the H. armigera/H. zea lineage had accumulated {{up to more than}} 100 more members of specific detoxification and digestion gene families and more than 100 extra <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptor</b> genes, compared to other lepidopterans with narrower host ranges. The two genomes remain very similar in gene content and order, but H. armigera is more polymorphic overall, and H. zea has lost several detoxification genes, as well as about 50 <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptor</b> genes. It also lacks certain genes and alleles conferring insecticide resistance found in H. armigera.

These genomic differences may suggest different mechanisms for CO 2 detection exist in different insects but, with the exception of Drosophila and mosquitoes, limited {{attention has been paid to}} the CO 2 GRs in insects. Here, we cloned three putative CO 2 GR genes from the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera and performed phylogenetic and expression analysis. All three H. armigera CO 2 GRs (HarmGR 1, HarmGR 2 and HarmGR 3) are specifically expressed in labial palps, the CO 2 -sensing tissue of this moth. HarmGR 3 is significantly activated by NaHCO 3 when expressed in insect Sf 9 cells but HarmGR 1 and HarmGR 2 are not. This is the first report characterizing the function of lepidopteran CO 2 receptors, which contributes to our general understanding of the molecular mechanisms of insect CO 2 <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptors...</b>|$|R
40|$|A novel {{family of}} {{candidate}} <b>gustatory</b> <b>receptors</b> (GRs) was recently identified in searches of the Drosophila genome. We have performed {{in situ hybridization}} and transgene experiments that reveal expression of these genes in both gustatory and olfactory neurons in adult flies and larvae. This gene family is likely to encode both odorant and taste receptors. We have visualized the projections of chemosensory neurons in the larval brain and observe that neurons expressing different GRs project to discrete loci in the antennal lobe and subesophageal ganglion. These data {{provide insight into the}} diversity of chemosensory recognition and an initial view of the representation of gustatory informa-tion in the fly brain...|$|R
