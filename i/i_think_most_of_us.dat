60|$|And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{will agree}} {{when we look}} back that the most real thing in our college life was not the lecturing and the lessons--very much of that stuff could very well {{have been done in}} the {{schooling}} stage--but the arguments of the debating society, the discussions that broke out in the classroom or laboratory, the talks in one's rooms about God and religion, about the state and freedom, about art, about every possible and impossible social relationship.|$|E

60|$|All {{this is by}} the way, to {{show that}} my apology for Mordax was not founded on his persuasion of superiority in his own motives, but on the {{compatibility}} of unfair, equivocal, and even cruel actions with a nature which, apart from special temptations, is kindly and generous; and also to enforce the need of checks from a fellow-feeling with those whom our acts immediately (not distantly) concern. Will any one be so hardy as to maintain that an otherwise worthy man cannot be vain and arrogant? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have some interest in arguing the contrary. And it is {{of the nature of}} vanity and arrogance, if unchecked, to become cruel and self-justifying. There are fierce beasts within: chain them, chain them, and let them learn to cower before the creature with wider reason. This is what one wishes for Mordax--that his heart and brain should restrain the outleap of roar and talons.|$|E
5000|$|Writing for TVEquals, Mark Trammell {{gave the}} episode a {{favorable}} review, saying: [...] "All in all, a decent enough episode, {{with lots of}} shipper bait and a major death that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> saw coming a mile away. Still, at least they’re taking people out for once- that’s three already and the season’s not even half over! I don’t know about you, but I’ll take it." ...|$|E

"It was {{a fantastic}} {{confidence}} boost," [...] Hecht {{said about the}} band's win in X-Press Magazine, [...] "To see how much things have evolved in the band dynamic, instrumentation and songwriting since recording the debut single is exciting. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would agree that we are far more proud of the music we've been writing since.

5000|$|Sudarshan’s earlier {{concerns}} and themes evolved around {{the politics of}} absence or loss of body, of death, of ‘being elsewhere’. The artist’s preoccupation with absence or {{what he calls the}} ‘philosophical absence of a physical body’ [...] was an inherent part of shows like Consanguinity (2003), Eight Corners of the World (2006) and Love (2006).‘I am interested in the idea of absence, a human absence, of being elsewhere. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are condemned to be elsewhere: I embrace this predicament and rejoice in it.’ ...|$|E
50|$|There's {{something}} rather {{sweet and}} gentle about the track - Shontelle's vocals {{are soft and}} plaintive, which suit {{the mood of the}} song perfectly, and while the lyrics are a bit hackneyed, with the references to Jimmy Choos and the brand name product placement of a t-shirt brand which, quite unlike the t-shirt in the song, is ill-fitting and uncomfortable, there's something incredibly likeable about the whole thing. There's a universality to it, too - <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have been in a situation like the one in the song where thoughts of a lover who's gone {{get in the way of}} your attempts to get on with your life.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2003 Critical Mass Melbourne rode {{through the}} Burnley Tunnel {{for the second}} time. Police Minister Andre Haermeyer said {{it was up to}} police to decide {{how to deal with the}} protest, [...] "I think {{everyone}} has the right to protest and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> accept some modest amount of inconvenience as a trade-off against that democratic right," [...] and added [...] "But this is just an outrageous impediment upon most people wanting to go home on a Friday night, the busiest night of the week. I think they're quite clearly a fringe element. I think they're irresponsible and reckless by taking the protest through the CityLink Tunnel." [...] The Age described the event as a parade moving [...] "peacefully amid a party atmosphere, with blaring music and much cheering". According to their report [...] "Some riders wore silly hats, dressed as clowns and animals and decorated their bikes with stuffed toys and teddy bears." [...] While State Opposition Leader Robert Doyle denounced the tunnel's closure as [...] "political correctness gone mad", a Victoria Police spokeswoman was pleased the action was over quickly.|$|E

40|$|Reviewing {{the events}} of the past year is usually a benign and relaxed process, but {{the events of}} 2009 have more likely caused spasms. If we look back, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> will give a sigh of relief that a new year is about to begin. With global {{economic}} uncertainty, local economic and political uncertainty, relentless Middle East conflicts, persisting poverty in developing countries, and a global pandemic, we have had many distractions during the year and could be excused for becoming short-tempered and irritable. But we have not become short-tempered and irritable; instead, it has been business as usual, and, as the contents of the Journal reflect, clinicians have continued to find ways to improve the quality of care. We are gratified that the number and scope of submissions to the Journal has continued to increase. The introduction of a digital edition of th...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{started out}} as an {{informal}} talk {{to a number of}} dispute resolution colleagues concerning what I believe is a neglected and important perspective on our field. My goal here is to bring some attention to that perspective, at two levels. First, I want to show that there is an underlying ideological dimension to the ongoing controversy over adjudication and mediation that accounts {{for a lot of the}} heat, if not a lot of the light, that goes on in the discussion of these and other dispute resolution processes. Second, I want to dig a bit deeper than <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have dug so far to try to say what that ideological dimension is, what the positions are that are being staked out and struggled over. I am especially interested in clarifying what I see as the ideological basis of the mediation side of the argument, where I think there has been little clarity to date...|$|E

40|$|I want to preface {{this article}} {{by saying that}} I have {{personally}} tried to implement {{what we are going}} to study, but I feel that I have only begun, because I think it is a subject that takes the Christian all his or her life to come to grips with. But in saying that I also want to make another point. The subject of the call to Christian meditation in the Bible is something that I have become increasingly impassioned about, and especially for the development of Christian leadership. I think part of the reason we have a crisis in Christian leadership is because we are not training leaders in the old biblical art of meditation. I hope by the end of our study you, too, will see the truth of that. Introduction: Prejudices Against the Practice of Meditation I want to begin with a word of honesty. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have some very negative prejudices against the subject of meditation. I think we need to be honest about that. I have identified five prejudices that I see I have had in the past, and perhaps still have to some degree, but...|$|E
40|$|The {{dedication}} {{of this book}} is to Katie, Hamish, Samantha and Romayne - May they live in hope for, not fear of, the future. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would wish the same for our children, but few of us are as resolute as Richard Hobbs and Denis Saunders {{in their efforts to}} change the ecological future of the world. I can think of no group of researchers that has worked harder to understand the impact of human society on the Australian landscape and to find ways to accommodate human needs and desires with ecological reality than the CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology laboratory at Helena Valley in Western Australia. While many of us work hard at our research, few can claim to have achieved the level of communication of the Western Australians. For nearly a decade now, Saunders, Hobbs and their colleagues have organized, held and published a series of symposia and workshops on the impact of agriculture (and to a lesser extent, forestry) on the landscape and its wildlife. These proceedings have been international in scope and have brought together, in a way few others have achieved, scientists, farmers, resource managers, politicians, bureaucrats and environmental groups. On behalf of my children, Jeni and Myella, I want to thank them for their efforts...|$|E

Hopefully all of you were able to take in at least one of these. A notable void is being created in the Ministry of Forests Seed Section by the retirement of Jenji Konishi after 33. 5 years with the B. C. Forest Service. jenji has played a significant role in the development of B. C. ’s tree improvement, seed orchard production, seed processing and seedling production programs. His insight and support will certainly be n-dssed. Overall, 1994 has treated the industry well, with a fair bit of new greenhouse construction at several facilities, and the expansion into Alberta by at least three B. C. forest nurseries. Certainly never a dull moment, and lots of gossip on the “forest nursery grapevine ’ at all times!
