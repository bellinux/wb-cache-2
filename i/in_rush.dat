5|$|Prior to 1989 {{there were}} four local trains in each {{direction}} from Oslo to Hønefoss; followed by on rush hour service each, but this single service has since been terminated; mainly due to quicker travel times by coaches. The Ringerike Line would allow the Oslo Commuter Rail once again to serve Ringerike; other places served usually have one hourly service, with additional services <b>in</b> <b>rush</b> hour. Reducing travel time from Hønefoss to Oslo to 30 minutes would probably cause larger population growth in Ringerike.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are green, (red <b>in</b> <b>Rush</b> mode in the iOS mobile version) spiky {{circles that}} split cells larger than them into many pieces (16 or fewer, {{depending}} on the mass) and smaller cells can hide underneath a virus for protection against larger cells. Cells in 16 pieces can eat viruses without splitting, though it is usually dangerous moving in many pieces, as the cells are smaller and easier to eat.. Viruses are normally randomly generated, but players can make new viruses by feeding a virus, i.e. ejecting {{a small fraction of}} a player's cell's mass into the virus a few times, causing the virus to split and hence create another virus.|$|E
5|$|Appalachian State {{were ranked}} as the No. 1 {{team in the}} preseason FCS poll from The Sports Network, {{receiving}} 67 out of 70 first-place votes. The team had won the previous two FCS national championships and were favorites to win a third consecutive title according to media outlets. They had also won their last 14 games, the longest in either Division I subdivision at the time. They had an overall record of 6–34–1 against major FBS teams. The Mountaineers ran a no-huddle, spread option system, which they implemented in 2005, their first championship season. Two of the major offensive weapons for the team were Edwards, who had scored 15 passing touchdowns and 15 rushing touchdowns in 2006, and running back Kevin Richardson, who had scored an FCS-record 30 rushing touchdowns in 2006. The defensive unit for the Mountaineers was helmed by Corey Lynch, a safety; the Mountaineer defense ranked 11th <b>in</b> <b>rush</b> defense and 35th in pass defense during the 2006 season, but the team lost five of its six best tacklers from that season, as well as defensive lineman Marques Murrell, who led the FCS in sacks during the 2006 season. Despite losses at the defensive line, the secondary, the team's defensive strong point, remained virtually intact from the previous season. The Mountaineers' kicker was senior Julian Rauch, who made 10 out of 14 field goal attempts during the 2006 season.|$|E

The next year, Weis would utilize both Hampton (1,141 yards and 14 TD) and Jarrod Bunch (501 yards and 3 TD) to form a potent running back combination. The Giants would finish 6th <b>in</b> <b>rushing</b> yards and 2nd <b>in</b> <b>rushing</b> touchdowns <b>in</b> the NFL.|$|R

25|$|The buses {{changed the}} route, and {{continued}} from Rosenborg School down Nonnegata to Olav Trygvassons gate {{in the city}} centre, but not via the railway station. This was to reduce the travel time to the city from Rosenborg. They had a five-minute headway <b>in</b> <b>rush</b> hour, and eight minutes otherwise. From 16 December the line was driven in both directions. From February 1969 the buses were forced to drive via the station due the concession; this resulted in every other bus taking the former tram route via Singsaker to the city. This gave a 15-minute headway. The other route kept a 7–8 minute headway.|$|E
