5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E
500|$|... "The Pandorica Opens" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. Dan Martin of The Guardian {{praised the}} cinematic scope and cliffhanger, calling it [...] "the most audacious of showstoppers". He thought {{that so much}} happened in the episode that Rory's return felt like [...] "a minor plot point", though he considered that was because the audience knew <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Gavin Fuller, writing for The Daily Telegraph, praising it for bringing an [...] "epic, cinematic tale to stick in the memory" [...] that the series had [...] "arguably lacked", though he thought the assembly of the Alliance was [...] "rather fanboyish on Moffat's part". He also praised Smith for [...] "hit the right note" [...] and the revelations at the end for being [...] "genuinely shocking". Like Martin, he said that Rory's return was [...] "unsurprising", though [...] "well-handled" [...] and with some touching moments between him and Amy.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} stages of the album's development, it was {{promoted}} as an album of [...] "high-energy hip-hop." [...] Republic Records later described the album's musical style as [...] "aggressive rock" [...] in the stages preceding the album's release. Vanilla Ice referred to the album's musical style as [...] "skate rock." [...] The album's dark and thick sound fuses elements of heavy metal, punk rock and hip hop. Vanilla Ice stated that [...] "I wanted to express myself in a very intense way, and there was no way <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> with a drum machine. Basically, I'm bored with drum machines and samples and stuff. With a band, they can build the energy around me." [...] Many critics have noticed a similarity between the style of music present on Hard to Swallow and that of bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Vanilla Ice stated that although he knew of the bands, he [...] "didn't even listen to [...] any of them" [...] before he made the album, and he was not trying to imitate the musical style of the bands. [...] "It's just we have the same producer, and some of the guitars between that and Limp Bizkit are gonna sound similar. That's what happens when you've got the same guy producing them. [...] I had heard the Deftones more than any of them." ...|$|E

500|$|In December 2010, Murphy {{announced}} that the cast of Glee would be replaced {{at the end of}} the third season to coincide with their graduation. He said, [...] "Every year we're going to populate a new group. There's nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot." [...] He also revealed that some of the original cast would leave as early as 2012: [...] "I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives." [...] Murphy stated in July 2011 that Colfer would be one of the actors leaving {{at the end of the}} third season, and Colfer commented on the report, saying, [...] "We had kind of known since the beginning, since we started the show, that these characters were going to grow up and they were going to graduate eventually. I don't think I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> so soon, necessarily, but I think we knew something like this was coming." [...] However, Falchuk later said that while Colfer, along with Lea Michele and Cory Monteith, would graduate at the end of the third season, their graduation does not mean that they will leave the show. Falchuk insisted that [...] "it was never our plan or our intention to let them go.... They are not done with the show after this season." ...|$|E
500|$|U2 and McGuinness {{thought that}} too much money had been {{invested}} to abort the concert, and they sympathised with the fans who had travelled to the venue in the poor weather. Accordingly, they decided {{to proceed with the}} concert as planned. However, according to Ezratty, many of the crew were not in agreement and wanted to walk off the set. He said, [...] "The guys from the American sound company were not at all enamored with being out with this band. I can remember them saying, [...] "Oh, we could be out with Asia right now!' So they decided to pull the plug on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're going to pull the system down and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, a moment on which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. It was cold and raining and everybody was shivering, and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career. He said that if it were deemed that this show was in any way possible to happen, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> and it was not going to be tolerated that anybody would do anything but add their effort to a successful and positive outcome I just stood there and went, [...] "This is so cool. This is like a general rallying the troops.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Dupas {{was again}} {{released}} from prison in February 1985. Approximately one month later, he raped a 21-year-old woman on a beach at Blairgowrie. After alighting from his car, Dupas followed the woman and attacked her, holding {{her to the ground}} at knifepoint before raping her. He later told police: [...] "I'm sorry for what happened. Everyone was telling me I'm OK now. I never thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> again. I only wanted to live a normal life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dupri also {{demonstrated}} {{the possibility for}} a duet with Jackson and American singer Mariah Carey for the album. Carey commented in April 2006, [...] "He never {{talked to me about}} that, but if Jermaine has a concept, we should go and write something. I love Janet. I’ve been a big fan of Janet since 'Con-tro-ol!'". Later, Dupri said that the closer he got to Jackson and Mariah's duet, the more he knew where it should be at, elaborating that he felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> [...] "It depends on how quick my mind moves. We’re mixing records for [...] We’re not done yet. When I did Usher's My Way album, the last record I created was 'You Make Me Wanna...'. I'm thinking I might go back in, and I might tamper with it. [...] We gotta try to figure it out", he commented. However, the duet never came to fruition.|$|E
2500|$|Irenaeus {{does not}} simply parrot back the message of Paul in his {{understanding}} of salvation. One of the major changes that Irenaeus makes is when the Parousia will occur. [...] Paul states that he believes that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> soon, probably in his own lifetime [...] However, the end times does not happen immediately and Christians begin to worry and have doubts about the faith. For Irenaeus, sin is seen as haste, just as Adam and Eve quickly ate from the tree of knowledge as they pleased. On the other hand, redemption restored to humanity through the Christ's submission to God’s will. Thus, the salvation of man will also be restored to the original trajectory controlled by God forfeited in humanity's sinful in haste. This rather slower version of salvation {{is not something that}} Irenaeus received from Paul, but was a necessary construct given the delay of the second coming of Jesus.|$|E

2500|$|Cleverly {{earned the}} interim {{version of the}} belt on 11 December 2010 in an unimpressive contest with the Frenchman Nadjib Mohammedi at the Echo Arena in Liverpool. Winning 115–112, 116–111 and 115–113 on the {{scorecards}} despite also having a point deducted Cleverly described his opponent as [...] "very awkward" [...] and said [...] "he was making me miss and dragging me in {{but this is the}} way it goes sometimes." [...] Cleverly had fought for the interim title as the full champion Jürgen Brähmer was in the midst of an appeal against a 16-month jail sentence for assault and insulting behaviour. An appeal heard in Germany on 13 December 2010 would, if Brähmer had been unsuccessful and sent to prison, have resulted in the belt being vacated and Cleverly being upgraded to the full champion status. Proceedings however didn't result in the champion being sent to prison and a fight with Brähmer was scheduled for 21 May 2011 Speaking of the match up Cleverly said that he was glad that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> saying [...] "He's the champion and the only way I would consider myself a true champion is if I took the belt from him, rather than picking up the vacant title." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 2, 2010, Badu {{was charged}} with disorderly conduct for her public nudity, a class C {{misdemeanor}} indicating a $500 fine, when a witness came forward. According to Dallas Deputy Police Chief Mike Genovesi, the witness [...] "had two small children with her and was offended". In an interview for the Dallas Morning News, Badu said that her part in the video foreshadowed the controversy and reaction to the video, stating [...] "I knew that would happen, {{so as soon as}} the thought came to my mind, I decided to assassinate myself as a gesture. Because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> anyway. The video is a prediction of what is happening now". In an April 3, 2010 interview on The Wanda Sykes Show, she explained in response to critics of the video that she did not intend to disrespect the memory of John F. Kennedy with its allusion to his assassination, stating [...] "My point was grossly misunderstood all over America. JFK is one of my heroes, one of the nation's heroes. John F. Kennedy was a revolutionary; he was not afraid to butt heads with America, and I was not afraid to show America my butt-naked truth." [...] On April 28, 2010, Badu challenged the disorderly conduct charge by pleading not guilty rather than paying the fee by mail. On August 13, she paid the $500 fine and agreed to serve six months probation through February 11, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|In 1955, Coltrane married Naima (born Juanita Grubbs). Naima Coltrane, who {{was already}} a Muslim convert, heavily {{influenced}} his spirituality. [...] When they married, Naima had a five-year-old daughter named Antonia, later named Saeeda. Coltrane adopted Saeeda. Coltrane met Naima {{at the home of}} bassist Steve Davis in Philadelphia. The love ballad he wrote to honor his wife, [...] "Naima" [...] was Coltrane's favorite composition. In 1956 the couple left Philadelphia with their six-year-old daughter in tow and moved to New York City. [...] In August 1957, Coltrane, Naima and Saeeda moved into an apartment on 103d St. and Amsterdam Ave. in New York, near Central Park West. A few years later, John and Naima Coltrane purchased a home on Long Island on Mexico Street. This is the house where they would eventually break up in 1963. Said Naima about the break in J.C. Thomas's Chasin' the Trane: [...] "I could feel <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> sooner or later, so I wasn't really surprised when John moved out of the house in the summer of 1963. He didn't offer any explanation. He just told me there were things he had to do, and he left only with his clothes and his horns. He stayed in a hotel sometimes, other times with his mother in Philadelphia. All he said was, 'Naima, I'm going to make a change.' Even though I could feel it coming, it hurt, and I didn't get over it for at least another year." [...] But Coltrane kept a close relationship with Naima, even calling her in 1964 to tell her that 90% of his playing would be prayer. [...] Coltrane would be dead in four years, but he always kept in touch with her. Naima brought serenity and a calmness into his life. All who knew Naima described her gentle spirit and serenity. They remained in touch until his death in 1967. Naima Coltrane {{died of a heart attack}} in October 1996.|$|E
