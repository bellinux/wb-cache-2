5|$|The {{absence of}} any form of paving between the headstone rows {{contributes}} to {{the simplicity of the}} cemetery designs. Lawn paths add to the garden ambiance, and are irrigated during the dry season in countries where there is insufficient rain. Where irrigation is inappropriate or impractical, dry landscaping is an ecological alternative favoured by the Commission's horticulturists, {{as is the case in}} Iraq. Drier areas require a different approach not only for lawns, but also to plants and styles of planting. Similarly, there are separate horticultural considerations in tropical climates. When many cemeteries are concentrated within a limited area, like along the Western Front or Gallipoli peninsula, mobile teams of gardeners operate from a local base. Elsewhere, larger cemeteries have their own <b>dedicated</b> <b>staff</b> while small cemeteries are usually tended by a single gardener working part-time.|$|E

500|$|Besides {{changing}} {{the types of}} sports being covered, {{the manner in which}} they were covered changed as well. [...] Under earlier managing editors, the magazine's writing and editorial staff was organized by department. [...] Thus, there was a fashion department, a travel department, and a sports department, which covered all sports. [...] Laguerre reorganized the magazine, giving each sport its own separate department, so there would be a <b>dedicated</b> <b>staff</b> of writers in the baseball department, and a different boxing department, and another for pro football, and so on. [...] Laguerre also encouraged serious investigative journalism, and did not shy away from controversial issues. [...] In 1961, writer Ray Cave broke a story on point shaving in college basketball. [...] In 1968, under Laguerre's direction, and under secrecy from his superiors, the magazine ran a five-part series on the experience of black athletes in America.|$|E
