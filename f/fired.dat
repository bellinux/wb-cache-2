Different equipments such as <b>fire</b> extinguisher, axes and cutting equipment are used to fight against <b>fire.</b> <b>Fire</b> fighting vehicle {{is being used to}} transport firefighters to the scene as well as transport the <b>fire</b> fighting equipments. The <b>fire</b> fighter is still facing the risk of <b>fire</b> hazard because they still need to go near to <b>fire</b> scene. To reduce the <b>fire</b> fighter risk during <b>fire</b> incident, a <b>fire</b> fighting mobile robot is designed. <b>Fire</b> fighting mobile robot is a remote controlled machine that replace <b>fire</b> fighter to perform <b>fire</b> fighting task. The application of <b>fire</b> fighting mobile robot is able to reduce the direct contact of <b>fire</b> fighter to the <b>fire</b> hazards.
