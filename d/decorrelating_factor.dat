40|$|Multivariate geostatistical {{techniques}} {{take into}} account the statistical and spatial relationships between attributes but can be inferentially and computationally expensive. One way to circumvent these issues is to transform the spatially correlated attributes into a set of <b>decorrelated</b> <b>factors</b> for which the off diagonal elements of the spatial covariance matrix are zero. This requires the derivation of a transformation matrix that exactly or approximately diagonalises the spatial covariance matrix for all separation distances. The resultant factors can then analysed using the more straightforward univariate techniques. This thesis is concerned with the investigation of linear decorrclation methods whereby the resulting factors are linear combinations of the original attributes...|$|R
40|$|Eye {{growth in}} semi-hard cheeses was {{previously}} {{found to be}} subject to a strong spatial-dependency between the periphery and the core zone, and salt appeared to be a key factor to be studied to better understand the phenomenon of eye growth. An experiment was therefore designed to study salted and unsalted cheeses, by combining magnetic resonance imaging and a method for determining CO 2 production based on gas pressure measurements. Chemical and rheological tests were also performed to make sure that only the salt content was modified between the two types of cheeses. It appeared that the presence of salt induced a delay in both bacterial development and CO 2 production. The eyes in salted cheeses were found to be six times smaller, and their growth kinetics were slower. The combination of these two techniques thus made it possible to <b>decorrelate</b> <b>factors</b> and to quantify the influence of salt on eye development...|$|R
40|$|Geostatistics is {{a branch}} of applied {{mathematics}} that deals with spatially correlated data. Analysing and modelling spatially correlated data can be difficult and time consuming, especially for a multivariate data set. One of the techniques used to make analysis and modelling easier involves decorrelation, whereby a linear transformation on the sample variables is used to associate the spatially correlated variables {{with a set of}} <b>decorrelated</b> <b>factors</b> which are statistically and spatially independent. PCA {{was one of the first}} multivariate techniques and is mostly used as a data reduction technique. A popular alternative decorrelation technique often used in the mining industry is MAF. A study conducted by Bandarian (2008) found a relatively new decorrelation technique known as ACDC to be the method which produced the best spatial decorrelation for a multivariate moderately correlated data set consisting of four variables. In this thesis the PCA, MAF and ACDC methods are described and then applied to a multivariate data set supplied by Rio Tinto 2 ̆ 7 s Iron Ore Operations. Secondly, we explore whether it is preferable for the data set to be standardised or transformed via Gaussian anamorphosis to normal scores before being decorrelated. The data set consists of ten variables; however the three decorrelation methods were only applied to a subset of five variables (Fe, Ah 03, Si 02, LOI and Ti 02) which have the greatest similarity from a statistical and spatial point of view. The three methods were applied to both standardised and normalised data. For ACDC, additional inputs such as weights, number of iterations, tolerance and an initial guess for the diagonalising matrix were explored and investigated in order to get the best spatial decorrelation results possible. The overall best spatial decorrelation was achieved by performing ACDC on the standardised variables, using the matrix of eigenvectors of the correlation matrix as the initial guess for the diagonalising matrix as well as the first four experimental semivariogram matrices in the decorrelation. Transforming the variables to normal scores before decorrelation was found to be of no benefit, as the factors that were derived from the normalised variables with the exception of one, were not normally distributed following the decorrelation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{introduction}} of genetically-modified (GM) crops is {{often accompanied by}} other changes in cultural practices. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate these changes with the simulation model FLORSYS which quantifies the effects of cropping systems and pedoclimate on weed dynamics as well as indicators of weed-related biodiversity (species richness and equitability, trophic resources for birds, insects and pollinators) and crop production loss (yield loss, harvest contamination, harvesting problems, field infestation). The study focused on two GM maize variety types, i. e. expressing Bacillus thuringiensis toxins against insects (Bt) and tolerating the non-selective herbicide glyphosate (HT). Two contrasting maize-growing sites were studied: Aquitaine, a region in South-Western France, and Catalonia in North-Eastern Spain. Typical regional cropping systems containing maize were identified for each site from expert knowledge and the Biovigilance database recording French agricultural practices. GM scenarios were based on expert knowledge, literature and current Spanish practices. A total of 11 most probable scenarios (1 conventional, 3 Bt and 8 HT) were simulated over 28 years for each region, and repeated with 10 different regional random weather series. An additional series of 5 - 7 scenarios per region was run to <b>decorrelate</b> <b>factors,</b> and make it easier to identify the cultural practices responsible for changes in weed flora, biodiversity and production. The simulations showed that the changes accompanying the {{introduction of}} GM maize varieties affected weed flora as well as weed-related biodiversity and crop production loss, but that the consequences depended on local conditions. Most of these consequences were caused by simplifications in the cropping systems made possible by the GM varieties, rather than by the glyphosate associated to GM varieties. Simplified tillage or no-till increased weed harmfulness, particularly in Aquitaine where the weed flora was poorer and dominated by larger and more persistent species. Conversely, no-till cancelled part or all of the nefarious effects on biodiversity of simplified rotations (maize/wheat and maize monoculture), particularly by improving trophic resources offered by weeds to birds, insects and pollinators. Overall, biodiversity was less affected by simplified rotations in Catalonia where the initial weed flora was richer and more equitable. Delayed maize sowing reduced weed harmfulness and biodiversity, except food offer for insects and pollinators whose pertinent feeding period covered spring and summer (vs. winter for birds). Based on the two most affected weed-based biodiversity indicators, ex post monitoring after GM introduction should focus on birds in Aquitaine and on pollinators in Catalonia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{new form}} of {{covariance}} modelling for Gaussian mixture models and hidden Markov models is presented. This is an extension to an efficient form of covariance modelling used in speech recognition, semi-tied covariance matrices. In the standard form of semi-tied covariance matrices the covariance matrix is decomposed into a highly shared decorrelating transform and a component-specific diagonal covariance matrix. The use of a <b>factored</b> <b>decorrelating</b> transform is presented in this paper. This factoring effectively increases the number of possible transforms without {{increasing the number of}} free parameters. Maximum likelihood estimation schemes for all the model parameters are presented including the component /transform assignment, transform and component parameters. This new model form is evaluated on a large vocabulary speech recognition task. It is shown that using this factored form of covariance modelling reduces the word error rate. ...|$|R
40|$|Locally {{uncorrelated}} discriminant projections Face recognition method called locally uncorrelated discriminant projections (LUDP) is proposed, which {{addresses the}} two problems {{from a new}} aspect. More specifically, we propose a locally uncorrelated criterion, which aims to <b>decorrelate</b> learned discriminant <b>factors</b> over data locally rather than globally. It {{has been shown that}} the statistical uncorrelation criterion is an important property for reducing dimension and learning robust discriminant projection as well. However, data are always locally distributed, so {{it is more important to}} explore locally statistical uncorrelated discriminant information over data. We impose this newconstraint into a graph-based maximummargin analysis, so that LUDP also characterizes the local scatter as well as nonlocal scatter, seeking to find a projection that maximizes the difference, rather than the ratio between the nonlocal scatter and the local scatter.

40|$|Geostatistical {{conditional}} simulation has wide potential {{applications in}} the iron ore industry and is the favoured tool to assess variability and risk. Multivariate relationships are important in such simulation, for example between Fe and impurities such as Al 2 O 3, SiO 2 and P. Turning bands has been the main conditional simulation algorithm used in the Western Australian iron ore industry. In this thesis a more recent approach using minimum/maximum autocorrelation factors (MAF) and sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) are used together and performance comparisons are made with turning bands at Yandicoogina, a channel iron ore deposit (CID) in Western Australia. MAF-SGS and turning bands algorithms both performed well in simulating Fe, SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and P at Yandicoogina. Extensive checking of simulations showed both approaches could reasonably reproduce multivariate statistics and spatial continuity of composites including means, variances, histograms, quantile-quantile plots, scatter plots and variography in normal scores and data space, {{as well as in}} MAF space for the MAFSGS approach. MAF generated from transformed composites were largely uncorrelated and able to be considered independent for variography and simulation. Later back transformation from MAF space to normal scores space then to data space successfully reintroduced joint relationships seen in the conditioning data. While the MAF-SGS approach needs additional transformations compared with turning bands, a linear model of coregionalisation and hence the modelling of cross semivariograms is not required. If there are a high number of variables then construction of a linear model of coregionalisation becomes more difficult and the MAF approach may be preferred. In this study four variables were considered and a linear model of coregionalisation could be built. Turning bands transformations are from data space to normal scores space only, with no need to calculate or check any <b>decorrelated</b> <b>factors.</b> The two main methods currently used in the mining industry for determining optimum drillhole spacing with the use of conditional simulation were compared at the Test Pit area of the Bungaroo channel iron ore deposit, also in Western Australia. The " simulation-simulation" method generates precisions for various drillhole spacing using two stages of simulation, whereas the " simulation-estimation" approach calculates expected relative errors for different spacings via a simulation stage followed by an estimation step. Clear differences exist between the relative errors from the simulation-estimation method and the precisions calculated from the simulation-simulation method. The simulationestimation method appears more insensitive to the grid spacing with only moderate improvements in relative error as the drillhole spacing is tightened. The simulationsimulation method shows more marked improvement in precision with closer spacing and appears more realistic in this study. Al 2 O 3 is the main variable to consider at Bungaroo when choosing a suitable drillhole spacing. SiO 2 grades of composites are mainly below the SiO 2 cut off grade for ore whereas the mean Al 2 O 3 is grade is quite close to the Al 2 O 3 cut off grade for ore. Hence although SiO 2 has higher variability, it is not as critical as Al 2 O 3 for determination of drillhole spacing. Fe and P have greater spatial continuity than Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 and do not require such close drillhole spacing. Fifteen percent precision, based on a volume representing a quarter’s production and using the simulation-simulation method, may be regarded as acceptable for mine planning purposes. A resource evaluation drilling spacing of 150 m along strike and 50 m across strike appears appropriate for a precision of less than 15 % for a quarterly mining volume in determining Al 2 O 3 grade at Bungaroo...|$|R
40|$|Multi-view {{learning}} aims {{to learn}} an embedding space where multiple views are either maximally correlated for cross-view recognition, or <b>decorrelated</b> for latent <b>factor</b> disentanglement. A key challenge for deep multi-view representation learning is scalability. To correlate or decorrelate multi-view signals, the covariance {{of the whole}} training set should be computed which does not fit well with the mini-batch based training strategy, and moreover (de) correlation {{should be done in}} a way that is free of SVD-based computation in order to scale to contemporary layer sizes. In this work, a unified approach is proposed for efficient and scalable deep multi-view learning. Specifically, a mini-batch based Stochastic Decorrelation Loss (SDL) is proposed which can be applied to any network layer to provide soft decorrelation of the layer's activations. This reveals the connection between deep multi-view learning models such as Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) and Factorisation Autoencoder (FAE), and allows them to be easily implemented. We further show that SDL is superior to other decorrelation losses in terms of efficacy and scalability...|$|R
