25|$|The {{prior art}} {{qualification}} for the Live Traffic paper {{centered on the}} public accessibility of a document available on a FTP server. SRI argued that the <b>FTP</b> <b>site</b> was not publicly accessible because one would need the complete FTP address to view the paper. Additionally, the posting was not indexed and could only be found by an ordinary skilled user through “dumb luck”. Symantec and SSI countered that on multiple occasions SRI had provided links to the <b>FTP</b> <b>site</b> to multiple members of the intrusion detection community. Furthermore, SRI’s <b>FTP</b> <b>site</b> had been referenced by Google Groups and was widely regarded as a repository of information for computer security. Robinson’s examination of the case evidence noted that no {{attempts were made to}} limit access via password security. Robinson deemed the Live Traffic paper publicly accessible as established by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the precedent cases In re Bayer, In re Hall, In re Cronyn, and In re Klopfenstein. As such, Robinson ruled that the Live Traffic paper constituted as prior art and that the patents described in the publication were invalid.|$|E
25|$|On 15 July, Mann wrote {{giving his}} {{detailed}} response to Barton and Whitfield. He emphasised {{that the full}} data and necessary methods information was already publicly available in full accordance with National Science Foundation (NSF) requirements, so that other scientists {{had been able to}} reproduce their work. NSF policy was that computer codes are considered the intellectual property of researchers and are not subject to disclosure, but notwithstanding these property rights, the program used to generate the original MBH98 temperature reconstructions had been made available at the Mann et al. public <b>FTP</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} the Linux mascot being a penguin came from Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux. Tux was created by Larry Ewing in 1996 after an initial {{suggestion}} made by Alan Cox and further refined by Linus Torvalds on the Linux kernel mailing list. Torvalds took his inspiration from an image he found on an <b>FTP</b> <b>site,</b> showing a penguin figurine looking strangely like the Creature Comforts characters made by Nick Park. The first person to call the penguin [...] "Tux" [...] was James Hughes, who said that it stood for [...] "(T)orvalds (U)ni(X)". However, tux is also an abbreviation of tuxedo, the outfit which often springs to mind when one sees a penguin.|$|E

40|$|Introduction : Consulting {{engineers}} have unique information needs. These engineers {{also do not}} necessarily have formally organised information services such as libraries available in their companies to provide in their needs. Method: Time-line interviews were conducted to collect the data. The gap- metaphor in Dervin’s Sense-Making Approach was used to analyse the data. Leckie, Pettigrew and Sylvain’s General Model of the Information-Seeking of Professionals provided the framework for the study. Results: Consulting engineers rely heavily on people, personal files and personal knowledge for information. Other frequently used information sources include the Internet, <b>FTP</b> <b>sites</b> and digital cameras. Consulting engineers need information from varied sources {{in the initial stages}} of a project. Information {{in the final stages of}} a project comes from the project itself. Conclusion: More studies are required to study the use of <b>FTP</b> <b>sites</b> and digital cameras as sources of information...|$|R
