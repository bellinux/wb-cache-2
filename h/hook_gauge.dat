50|$|A <b>hook</b> <b>gauge</b> is {{the most}} {{reliable}} way to determine the actual size of a tool. Even though most hooks and needles have metric sizing, tool dimensions vary slightly between different manufacturers. Non-metric sizing conventions also change over time. For instance, different sizing charts rate a 4.0mm hook as either a U.S. G/6 or an F/5.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Hook</b> <b>gauge</b> {{evaporimeter}} is {{a precision}} instrument {{used to measure}} changes in water levels due to evaporation. It is used to precisely measure {{the level of a}} free water surface as an evaporation pan or a tank. The main users are meteorologists and water engineers, especially in hot, arid countries where water conservation is of vital importance.|$|E
5000|$|U.S. textile craft {{terminology}} {{employs the}} word gauge {{in two different}} ways: as <b>hook</b> <b>gauge</b> {{in reference to the}} sizing tool, or as a standalone term gauge to describe the number of stitches in a standard sized sample of work, usually 4" [...] or 10cm. UK terminology refers to the latter as tension. Craft patterns include a gauge or tension measurement and good practice among crafters is to achieve the correct gauge on a sample swatch before embarking on the full project.|$|E
40|$|A {{range of}} bosonic models can be {{expressed}} as (sometimes generalized) σ-models, with equations of motion coming from a selfduality constraint. We show that in D = 2, this is easily extended to supersymmetric cases, in a superspace approach. In particular, {{we find that the}} configurations of fields of a superconformal script B sign/hook sign coset models which satisfy some selfduality constraint are automatically solutions to the equations of motion of the model. Finally, we show that symmetric space σ-models can be seen as infinite-dimensional script B sign/hook sign models constrained by a selfduality equation, with script B sign the loop extension of script B sign and hook sign a maximal subgroup. It ensures that these models have a hidden global script B sign symmetry together with a local <b>hook</b> sign <b>gauge</b> symmetry. © SISSA/ISAS 2004.

2500|$|Tackle {{for larger}} fish is more robust, with 50-lb line {{on a large}} {{overhead}} or threadline type reel used to prevent the fish from taking cover in underwater structures on their first run, especially on reefs and wrecks. Smaller fish are often taken on light tackle, often requiring a skilled angler {{to be able to}} land the fish in these situations. They can be caught on both bait and [...] lures, with small live baitfish or large prawns the choice of baits rigged on strong <b>gauge</b> <b>hooks.</b> Lures are often jigs or streamers worked on deep reefs and wrecks, although they have been known to take a trolled lure or rigged bait. In rare cases, they have even been known to take saltwater flies on sinking lines and poppers at the surface.|$|R
40|$|An elastomer-based {{energy storage}} system for MEMS has been designed, built, and tested. Micro rubber bands have been {{fabricated}} from silicone using two different methods, laser-cut and molded, and assembled into silicon microstructures fabricated in a two-mask silicon-on-insulator (SOI) process. Using silicon <b>hooks</b> and force <b>gauges</b> designed in this process, these micro rubber bands have been characterized as to their energy storage potential and efficiency by stretching them with a probe tip. These tests showed recovered energy efficiencies up to 92 % at strains over 200 % with a maximum stored energy over 19 µJ. In addition, a fully integrated micromechanical {{energy storage system}} to both store and release energy has been demonstrated using an electrostatic inchworm motor to stretch the elastomer band and release it. Using the inchworm motor, an estimated 4. 9 nJ of energy was stored in the elastomer spring and quickly released...|$|R
50|$|As one crochet guidebook explains:Whenever you are {{following}} a crochet pattern {{you will notice}} that a gauge is included. This is an all-important guide to obtaining the proper size of the square or garment you are working on. If you don't get the proper gauge, the item will not fit properly and you may run out of yarn before finishing.Several factors affect fabric gauge including hook or needle size, although sometimes a crafter may change tool size deliberately {{in order to achieve}} a certain gauge. Accurate needle and hook sizing reduces the number of variables that affect these decisions. Additionally, if substitute tools are needed {{during the course of the}} project a <b>hook</b> <b>gauge</b> can determine whether a given tool is appropriate in advance of actual work.|$|E
40|$|Region: Upper Zambezi {{catchment}} and {{the river}} flow gauge at Kafue Hook (13. 4 S, 27. 8 E), typified by gentle topography and a strong seasonal cycle. Focus: Evaluation of satellite and model estimates of hydro-meteorology conditions using data in the period 1998 – 2015, to supplement the very limited operational reports coming from the region. Insights: Satellite soil moisture and model run-off track the Kafue <b>Hook</b> <b>gauge</b> with correlation values of 84 % and 68 %, respectively. Satellite river flow estimates achieve a logarithmic fit to monthly and daily gauge of 92 % and 65 %, respectively. Discrepancies are related to inadequate (calibration) reporting and to under-estimation of evaporation in the dry season. Statistical analyses of satellite rainfall and model evaporation are used to suggest improvements to hydro-meteorology network coverage in the upper Zambezi. An automated online network of ∼ 20 weather stations and river flow gauges appears sufficient, given satellite-model ability to interpolate between observations...|$|E
