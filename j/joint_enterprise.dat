5|$|The British National Antarctic Expedition, later {{known as}} the Discovery Expedition, was a <b>joint</b> <b>enterprise</b> of the RGS and the Royal Society. A long-cherished dream of Markham's, it {{required}} all of his skills and cunning to bring the expedition to fruition, under naval command and largely staffed by naval personnel. Scott {{may not have been}} Markham's first choice as leader but, having decided on him, the older man's support remained constant. There were committee battles over the scope of Scott's responsibilities, with the Royal Society pressing to put a scientist in charge of the expedition's programme while Scott merely commanded the ship. Eventually, however, Markham's view prevailed; Scott was given overall command, and was promoted to the rank of commander before Discovery sailed for the Antarctic on 6 August 1901. King Edward VII, who showed a keen interest in the expedition, visited the Discovery the day before the ship left British shores in August 1901, and during the visit appointed Scott a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO), his personal gift.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>joint</b> criminal <b>enterprise</b> at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has been controversial since the doctrine was first created in 1997. For the judgments rendered by the ICTY {{to be perceived}} as legitimate, the doctrines used to bring charges against defendants must also be perceived as legitimate. The purpose of my thesis is to study the application of <b>joint</b> criminal <b>enterprise</b> at the ICTY and examine how the doctrine has influenced the length of sentences given. I find that <b>joint</b> criminal <b>enterprise</b> may be influencing longer sentences and the three categories of <b>joint</b> criminal <b>enterprise</b> are being used differently on defendants of different power levels. By empirically analyzing the patterns developing at the ICTY, I can see how <b>joint</b> criminal <b>enterprise</b> is influencing sentencing and the fairness of trials. i...|$|R
25|$|An Estonian oil {{syndicate}} {{became a}} joint Estonian-Soviet enterprise in 1928 and Päts {{was hired by}} it as a legal consultant in 1930. His annual salary was $4,000, which was {{twice as much as}} the State Elder earned and more than eight times as muchs as Päts earned {{as a member of the}} Riigikogu. The purpose of the <b>joint</b> <b>enterprise</b> for the Soviets was not supposed to be business-related, but only to attract Päts. This official salary by the Soviet Union has thus been seen as the salary for his long-term cooperation with the Soviets. After Päts's coup d'état, the Soviet Union increased economic cooperation with Estonian enterprises.|$|E

The team reclaimed the former dump and transformed the area into a lush green space, with new sod, trees, sprinkler and drainage system. The crew, mostly student volunteers, worked through the torrid Texas summer to lay sod, trim and transplant trees, pack down limestone base, lay down the stage bricks, tear out poison ivy, and more.|$|E
25|$|On 26 December 1809, Blazer and Paz {{were serving}} {{independently}} blockading the river Ems when Blazer captured an American vessel that {{was attempting to}} breach the blockade. Paz sued {{to share in the}} proceeds on two grounds: first, that the two British vessels were engaged in a <b>joint</b> <b>enterprise,</b> and second, that Paz had been in sight {{at the time of the}} capture. The court ruled that Lord George Stuart, who commanded the station at Heligoland, had sent the two British vessels out with parallel, but not joint orders. It further ruled that there was no independent evidence that Paz had been in sight. The court therefore denied the claim. The case was nevertheless important in that it helped define the meaning of blockade.|$|E

500|$|The new theatre {{was more}} {{expensive}} to run than the Old Vic, as a larger orchestra and more singers were needed, and box office receipts were at first inadequate.

500|$|At the Combined Policy Committee {{meeting in}} February 1946, without prior {{consultation}} with Canada, the British announced {{their intention to}} build a graphite-moderated nuclear reactor in the United Kingdom. An outraged Howe told Canadian ambassador Lester B. Pearson to inform the Committee that nuclear cooperation between Britain and Canada was at an end. The Canadians had been given what they deemed assurances that the Chalk River Laboratories would be a <b>joint</b> <b>enterprise,</b> and regarded the British decision as a breach of faith. Anglo-American cooperation largely ended in April 1946 when Truman declared that the United States would not assist Britain in the design, construction or operation of a plutonium production reactor. The Americans had agreed that such a facility could be built in Canada, but the British were not willing {{to be dependent on}} Canada for the supply of fissile material.|$|E

40|$|In human societies, {{cooperative}} {{behavior in}} <b>joint</b> <b>enterprises</b> is often enforced through institutions that impose sanctions on defectors. Many experiments on so-called public goods games {{have shown that}} {{in the absence of}} such institutions, individuals are willing to punish defectors, even at a cost to themselves. Theoretical models confirm that social norms prescribing the punishment of uncooperative behavior are stable -once established, they prevent dissident minorities from spreading. But how can such costly punishing behavior gain a foothold in the population? A surprisingly simple model shows that if individuals have the option to stand aside and abstain from the joint endeavor, this paves the way for the emergence and establishment of cooperative behavior based on the punishment of defectors. Paradoxically, the freedom to withdraw from the common enterprise leads to enforcement of social norms. <b>Joint</b> <b>enterprises</b> that are compulsory rather than voluntary are less likely to lead to cooperation...|$|R
