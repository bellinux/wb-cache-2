5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{population in}} Europe crashed {{in the second}} half of the 20th century. The decline coincided with the introduction of cyclodiene insecticides – aldrin, dieldrin and <b>heptachlor</b> – used as seed dressings in agriculture in 1956. The chemicals accumulated in the bodies of grain-eating birds and had two effects on top predators like the Eurasian sparrowhawk and peregrine falcon: the shells of eggs they laid were too thin, causing them to break during incubation; and birds were poisoned by lethal concentrations of the insecticides. Sub-lethal effects of these substances include irritability, convulsions and disorientation. In west Germany, around 80% of nests before the 1950s produced young, but only 54% were successful in the 1960s and '70s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the September 27, 1962, publication, there was strong {{opposition}} to Silent Spring from the chemical industry. DuPont (a main manufacturer of DDT and 2,4-D) and Velsicol Chemical Company (exclusive manufacturer of chlordane and <b>heptachlor)</b> were among the first to respond. DuPont compiled an extensive report on the book's press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion. Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton Mifflin as well as The New Yorker and Audubon unless the planned Silent Spring features were canceled. Chemical industry representatives and lobbyists also lodged a range of non-specific complaints, some anonymously. Chemical companies and associated organizations produced a number of their own brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use. However, Carson's and the publishers' lawyers were confident in the vetting process Silent Spring had undergone. The magazine and book publications proceeded as planned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing (which included a pamphlet endorsing the book by William O. Douglas).|$|E
500|$|By 1959, the USDA's Agricultural Research Service {{responded to}} the {{criticism}} by Carson and others with a public service film, Fire Ants on Trial; Carson characterized it as [...] "flagrant propaganda" [...] that ignored the dangers that spraying pesticides (especially dieldrin and <b>heptachlor)</b> posed to humans and wildlife. That spring, Carson wrote a letter, published in The Washington Post, that attributed the recent decline in bird populations—in her words, the [...] "silencing of birds"—to pesticide overuse. That was also {{the year of the}} [...] "Great Cranberry Scandal": the 1957, 1958, and 1959 crops of U.S. cranberries were found to contain high levels of the herbicide aminotriazole (which caused cancer in laboratory rats) and the sale of all cranberry products was halted. Carson attended the ensuing FDA hearings on revising pesticide regulations; she came away discouraged by the aggressive tactics of the chemical industry representatives, which included expert testimony that was firmly contradicted by the bulk of the scientific literature she had been studying.

40|$|Fish {{consumption}} {{is known to}} have several health benefits for humans. However, the accumulation of organic pollutants, like organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) could pose health hazards. Thus, OCPs in edible fish species (Oreochromis niloticus, Tilapia zillii, Carassius spp., and Clarias gariepinus) from Lake Ziway, an Ethiopian Rift Valley Lake were investigated to assess the potential human health hazards of these contaminants. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), chlordanes, and <b>heptachlors</b> were observed with Sigma OCPs concentration ranging from 1. 41 to 63. 8 ng g(- 1) ww. DDTs were the predominant contaminants (0. 9 to 61. 9 ng g(- 1) ww), followed by HCHs. The predominance of DDTs may be attributed to their current use in vector control and contamination from past usage. The estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of OCPs from all fish species were much lower than the acceptable daily intakes (ADIs), indicating that consumption of fish is at little risk to human health at present. However, the cancer risk estimates in the area of concern and the hazard ratios (HRs) of HCHs, DDTs, and <b>heptachlors</b> exceeded the threshold value of one, indicating daily exposure to these compounds is a potential concern. This may result in a lifetime cancer risk greater than of I in 10 (6). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|An {{innovative}} ex situ {{soil washing}} technology {{was developed in}} this study to remediate organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) -contaminated site. Elevated temperature (50 degrees C) combined with ultrasonication (35 kHz, 30 min) at 25 g L- 1 methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and 100 mL L- 1 sunflower oil were effective in extracting OCPs from the soil. After four successive washing cycles, the removal efficiency for total OCPs, DDTs, endosulfans, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -hexachlorocyclohexanes, <b>heptachlors,</b> and chlordanes were all about 99 %. The 4 th washed soil with 3 months cultivation of Portulaca oleracea L. and nutrient addition significantly increase (p < 0. 05) the number, biomass carbon, nitrogen, and functioning diversity of soil microorganisms. This implied that the microbiological functioning of the soil was at least partially restored. This combined cleanup strategy proved to be effective and environmental friendly. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Organochlorine {{pesticides}} (OCPs) {{and stable}} isotopes were measured in muscle from 4 bird and 5 fish species from the Ethiopian Rift Valley region where DDT {{is used for}} malaria control and vast agricultural activities are carried out. We investigated the bioaccumulation of OCPs such as DDTs, HCHs, chlordanes, and <b>heptachlors</b> between the species, and examined the potential risk posed by these compounds for bird species. Significant differences in contaminant profiles and levels were observed within the species. Levels of total OCPs ranged from 3. 7 to 148. 7 mu g/g lipid in bird and 0. 04 to 10. 9 mu g/g lipid in fish species. DDTs were the predominant contaminant, and {{a positive relationship between}} delta N- 15 and Sigma DDT concentrations was found. The main DDT metabolite, p,p'-DDE was the most abundant and significantly greater concentrations in bird species (up to 138. 5 mu g/g lipid), which could have deleterious effects on survival and/or reproduction of birds.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of photocatalytic treatment with titanium dioxide in the degradation of 44 organic pesticides analyzed systematically in the Ebro river basin (Spain). The effect of the addition of hydrogen peroxide in this treatment is studied, and a monitoring of effectiveness of photocatalytic processes is carried out by measurements of physical-chemical parameters of water. The application of photocatalytic treatment with 1 [*]g[*]L− 1 of TiO 2 during 30 minutes achieves an average degradation of the studied pesticides of 48 %. Chlorine demand, toxicity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration of water are reduced. If hydrogen peroxide is added with a concentration of 10 [*]mM, the average degradation of pesticides increases up to 57 %, although chlorine demand and toxicity of water increase while DOC concentration remains unchanged with this treatment. The application of either photocatalytic treatments does not produce variations in the physical-chemical parameters of water, such as pH, conductivity, colour, dissolved oxygen, and hardness. The pesticides which are best degraded by photocatalytic treatments are parathion methyl, chlorpyrifos, α-endosulphan, 3, 4 -dichloroaniline, 4 -isopropylaniline, and dicofol while the worst degraded are HCHs, endosulphan-sulphate, <b>heptachlors</b> epoxide, and 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzophenone...|$|R
40|$|Organochlorine {{pesticides}} (OCPs) {{have been}} a major environmental issue, attracting much scientific concern because of their nature of toxicity, persistence, and endocrine disrupting effects. Soil samples were collected from ten college school yards in Beijing in 2006 and analyzed to determine fifteen OCPs. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) were found to be the main pollutants, accounting for 93. 70 % of total OCPs, followed by hexachlorohexanes (HCHs) (2. 25 %) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) (1. 82 %). Content of chlordanes (CHLs), <b>heptachlors</b> (HEPTs), and endosulfans comprised 0. 51 %, 1. 05 %, and 0. 79 % of fifteen OCPs, respectively. The preliminary pollution assessment indicated that DDTs have caused high OCPs levels in some schools. Source identification showed that HCHs in soils were originated from an old mixed source of technical HCHs and lindane. And DDTs were mainly from mixed use of technical DDTs and dicofol containing DDT impurities. According to GB 15618 - 1995 (guidelines of Chinese environmental quality standards for soils), HCHs and DDTs levels might be categorized as little and low polluting pesticides. This study indicated that the environmental quality of college school yards with large green land were not as good as was expected and there existed potential exposure risk of college population to OCPs...|$|R
5000|$|Soil {{microorganisms}} transform <b>heptachlor</b> by epoxidation, hydrolysis, and reduction.

40|$|Data on {{the impact}} of {{environmental}} pollution on the homeostasis of sea turtles remains scarce, particularly in the southern Gulf of Mexico. As many municipalities along the coastline of the Yucatan Peninsula do not rely on a waste treatment plant, these organisms could be particularly vulnerable. We searched for relationships between the presence of organochlorine pesticides (OCP) and the level of several oxidative and pollutant stress indicators of the hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) during the 2010 nesting season at Punta Xen (Campeche, Mexico). Of the 30 sampled sea turtles, endosulfans, aldrin related (aldrin, endrin, dieldrin, endrin ketone, endrin aldehyde) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDT) families were detected in 17, 21 and 26, respectively. Significant correlation existed between the size of sea turtles with the concentration of methoxychlor, cholinesterase activity in plasma and <b>heptachlors</b> family, and catalase activity and hexachlorohexane family. Cholinesterase activity in washed erythrocytes and lipid peroxidation were positively correlated with glutathione reductase activity. Antioxidant enzyme actions seem adequate as no lipids damages were correlated with any OCPs. Future studies are necessary to evaluate the effect of OCPs on males of the area due to the significant detection of methoxychlor, which target endocrine functioning and increases its concentration with sea turtles size...|$|R
30|$|Analyses of {{selected}} contaminants in sediments of Taihu Lake showed that metals (Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, Zn, Cd, As), OCPs, PCBs and PBDEs were detectable at both caging sites. Sediment quality assessment values for freshwater ecosystems in Canada [56] were consulted to evaluate potential {{risks associated with}} the observed chemicals. These guidelines consider two effect levels for the characterization of potential toxicological risks, the threshold effect level (TEL) and the probable effect level (PEL). The TEL represents the concentrations of these contaminants below which adverse biological effects only rarely occur, while the PEL represents the concentrations of these contaminants above which adverse biological effects frequently occur [56]. In this study, none of the chemical contaminants detected in sediments from both sites were found to exceed the PEL threshold values (Table  1). However, concentrations of Cu, Ni and As in sediments from site A were greater than their TEL. For OCPs, the concentrations of 4, 4 ′-DDE in sediments from site A and site B {{were found to be}} above the TEL. Similarly, Zhao et al. [41] demonstrated that high residues of OCPs, including DDTs, HCHs, <b>heptachlors</b> and chlordanes, persisted in surface sediments and B. aeruginosa collected at 20 locations in Taihu Lake. Thus, there is the potential for chemical compounds in sediments from Taihu Lake to have adverse effects on aquatic organisms. In addition, all concentrations of chemicals analyzed in the sediment collected from site A, except for PBDEs, were greater than those at site B. This is in accordance with the result that the survival rate of B. aeruginosa caged at site A was lower than that of snails caged at site B after different exposure times (7 and 14  days), indicating that B. aeruginosa was a relatively sensitive species for biomonitoring in Taihu Lake.|$|R
