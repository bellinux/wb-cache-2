5|$|During the <b>Great</b> <b>Leap</b> Forward, Pan {{sympathized with}} Marshal Peng Dehuai, {{a critic of}} Mao Zedong's {{collectivization}} policy. As a result, in 1958 he was dismissed as party chief of Henan and subjected to persecution, but was later rehabilitated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1957 Mao {{suggested}} a nationwide programme of mass collectivization, in which China's farmers would be forcibly relocated to large agricultural communes and all private property would be eliminated. Mao's theories on mass collectivization became {{the basis of the}} <b>Great</b> <b>Leap</b> Forward, a national economic plan that began in 1958 which caused a man-made famine across the country that lasted for several years. By 1959, {{tens of millions of people}} had starved to death. From October–December 1958, the economic system in the countryside broke down as farmers refused to go to work in the fields, raided government granaries for food, and in Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Qinghai, rebelled. In December 1958 China's leaders quietly decided to reverse the policies of the <b>Great</b> <b>Leap.</b>|$|E

40|$|Early {{intervention}} for struggling readers {{is essential for}} developing fluency and more complex reading skills. One supplemental reading program that demonstrates research support is the <b>Great</b> <b>Leaps</b> Reading Program (Mercer & Campbell, 1998). The current study implemented an adaptation of the <b>Great</b> <b>Leaps</b> K- 2 Reading Program to provide targeted interventions to four participants in an individual setting to determine whether training in pre-reading skills would result in improvement in letter sound fluency (LSF) and oral reading fluency (ORF). In addition, this study examined whether changing the <b>Great</b> <b>Leaps</b> activities to incorporate practice reading connected text would increase students' ORF. Results suggest that the students' LSF skills benefitted from this modified intervention. Not {{all of the students}} demonstrated gains in ORF. Limitations, implications for practice, and directions for future research are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Peng did {{not oppose}} Mao's collectivizations {{in the first}} phase of the <b>Great</b> <b>Leap,</b> from late 1957– early 1958, but he {{increasingly}} opposed it from spring-winter 1958, as the problems which Mao's policies had caused became more evident. In February 1958 Peng gave a speech for the fortieth anniversary of the Soviet Red Army, in which he suggested increased military cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Mao opposed this suggestion, and began grooming Lin Biao as a viable successor to Peng for the position of Defense Minister. As part of the <b>Great</b> <b>Leap</b> Forward, Mao ordered the formation of a national militia that was controlled by Party members and independent of the PLA, eventually training and arming tens of millions of civilians.|$|E
5|$|During the Anti-Rightist Movement and the <b>Great</b> <b>Leap</b> Forward, Pan Fusheng {{sympathized with}} Marshal Peng Dehuai, who criticized Mao's {{disastrous}} collectivization policies. As a result, {{he became a}} major target of persecution by the fervent Mao loyalist Wu Zhipu, the Second Secretary of Henan, {{with the approval of}} the CPC Central Committee.|$|E
5|$|Incidentally, the {{harmonic}} telegraph directly suggested to Bell {{the idea of}} the telephone. The reeds can be viewed as transducers converting sound to and from an electrical signal. It is no <b>great</b> <b>leap</b> from this view of {{the harmonic}} telegraph to the idea that speech can be converted to and from an electrical signal.|$|E

5|$|After Mao Zedong purged Peng in 1959, Mao {{appointed}} Marshal He Long to {{the head}} of an office to investigate Peng's past in order to find additional reasons to criticize Peng. He accepted the position but was sympathetic to Peng, and stalled for over a year before submitting his report. Mao's prestige weakened when it became widely known that Mao's <b>Great</b> <b>Leap</b> Forward had been a disaster, and He eventually presented a report that was positive, and which attempted to vindicate Peng.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{blast furnace}} {{remained}} in use well until the 20th century. The backyard furnaces favoured by Mao Zedong during the <b>Great</b> <b>Leap</b> Forward were of this type. In the regions with strong traditions of metallurgy, the steel production actually increased during this period. In the regions {{where there was}} no tradition of steelmaking or where the ironmasters knowing the traditional skills or the scientific principles of the blast furnace process had been killed, the results were less than satisfactory.|$|E
5|$|Although the CCC {{became a}} {{powerful}} political {{force in the}} following years, at the 8th National Congress in 1956 its inspectors were warned about abusing their power and becoming independent of their local party committees. Its power waned during the <b>Great</b> <b>Leap</b> Forward, but the CCC, the Secretariat and the Organisation Department became the chief weapons {{in the aftermath of}} the <b>Great</b> <b>Leap</b> to combat corruption and reverse verdicts on rightists. The CCC played its new role until the Cultural Revolution, a socio-political movement which lasted from 1966 until 1976, when it was affected by purges (partly due to its close ties to Peng Zhen, one of the first highly ranked officials purged during the Cultural Revolution). At the 9th National Congress in 1969 the CCC was abolished, removed from the party constitution and replaced by special-case organisations (such as the Central Case Examination Group) formed under Mao and Kang Sheng. Despite its abolition at the congress, little criticism was directed at the CCC during the Cultural Revolution; although CCC Deputy Secretary Min Yifan was criticised by the Red Guards, a revolutionary youth movement independent of the party (but inspired by Mao) during the Cultural Revolution, most of their disapproval focused on his career on local committees rather than the CCC. Talk of an internal party-control system would not resurface until the death of Mao and the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976.|$|E

5|$|Castro's {{increasing}} role on {{the world}} stage strained his relationship with the USSR, now under the leadership of Leonid Brezhnev. Asserting Cuba's independence, Castro refused to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, declaring it a Soviet-U.S. attempt to dominate the Third World. Diverting from Soviet Marxist doctrine, he suggested that Cuban society could evolve straight to pure communism rather than gradually progress through various stages of socialism. In turn, the Soviet-loyalist Aníbal Escalante began organizing a government network of opposition to Castro, though in January 1968, he and his supporters were arrested for allegedly passing state secrets to Moscow. However, recognising Cuba's economic dependence on the Soviets, Castro relented to Brezhnev's pressure to be obedient, and in August 1968 he denounced the leaders of the Prague Spring and praised the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Influenced by China's <b>Great</b> <b>Leap</b> Forward, in 1968 Castro proclaimed a Great Revolutionary Offensive, closing all remaining privately owned shops and businesses and denouncing their owners as capitalist counter-revolutionaries. The severe lack of consumer goods for purchase led productivity to decline, as large sectors of the population felt little incentive to work hard. This was exacerbated by the perception that a revolutionary elite had emerged consisting of those connected to the administration; they had access to better housing, private transportation, servants, and the ability to purchase luxury goods abroad.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Great</b> <b>Leap</b> Forward {{campaign}} began {{during the}} period of the Second Five Year Plan which was scheduled to run from 1958 to 1963, though the campaign itself was discontinued by 1961. Mao unveiled the <b>Great</b> <b>Leap</b> Forward at a meeting in January 1958 in Nanjing.|$|E
25|$|The {{agricultural}} {{policies of}} the <b>Great</b> <b>Leap</b> Forward and the associated famine continued until January 1961, when, at the Ninth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the restoration of agricultural production through {{a reversal of the}} <b>Great</b> <b>Leap</b> policies was started. Grain exports were stopped, and imports from Canada and Australia helped to reduce the impact of the food shortages, at least in the coastal cities.|$|E

25|$|In cities {{during the}} <b>Great</b> <b>Leap,</b> {{there was an}} {{emphasis}} on collective use of public space even for activities that had usually {{taken place in the}} home. For example, entire neighborhoods were required to eat their dinner in public dining halls. Ultimately, the <b>Great</b> <b>Leap</b> Forward proved disastrous, failing to industrialize effectively and causing famine due to labor shortages on farms. In 1962, the government began allowing people to move back to farms.|$|E
