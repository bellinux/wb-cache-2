60|$|Next night I was at {{the same}} spot with a good duck call, and some wooden decoys, over which the skins of wild ducks had been {{carefully}} stretched. An hour after dark he came again, attracted, no doubt, by the continued quacking. I had another swift glimpse of what seemed only a shadow; saw it poise and shoot downward before I could find it with my gun sight, striking the decoys with a great splash and clatter. Before he discovered his mistake or could get started again, I had him. The next moment Don came ashore, proud as a peacock, bringing a <b>great</b> <b>snowy</b> <b>owl</b> with him--a rare prize, worth ten times the trouble we had taken to get it.|$|E

Nearby is an enclosure for black-and-white colobus. Next to the railway station entrance is the wolverine enclosure.

Next to the wolverines are the pheasant aviaries.|$|R

50|$|The area {{is home to}} {{many species}} of {{wildlife}} including some protected and endangered species. White-tailed deer, moose, elk, <b>great</b> horned <b>owl,</b> <b>snowy</b> <b>owl,</b> gray wolf, canadian lynx, peregrine falcon, coyote and the rare skink {{are a few of}} the animal species that are found within the former RM. Although not common, American black bears, bobcats and pumas are also routinely spotted in the area.|$|R
50|$|New England Farmyard- Designed as a {{small rural}} farm, the exhibit {{features}} a collection of farm animals, mainly of breeds which originated in New England, {{as well as some}} wild species that might be found in rural Connecticut. Domestic animals include Dexter cattle, Llama, Guinea hog, Cotswold sheep, various goat breeds, a feral cat, Domestic rabbit, and various chicken, goose, and duck breeds. Wild animals include North American porcupine, <b>great</b> horned <b>owl,</b> <b>snowy</b> <b>owl,</b> American barn owl, common raven, Tundra swan, cackling goose, and Diamondback terrapin. The zoo has bred several rare breeds on many occasions, including Guinea hogs almost yearly since 2009.|$|R
50|$|Birds also inhabit sloughs. Sloughs are a hotspot bird {{watching}}. For example, the Elkhorn Slough in {{the western}} United States {{is one of the}} premier bird watching sites {{in the western}} United States. Over 340 species are seen visiting including several rare and endangered species. Species of birds seen in sloughs such as the Elkhorn slough include Acorn Woodpecker, Brown Pelican, Caspian Tern, Great BlueHeron, Great Egret, <b>Great</b> Horned <b>Owl,</b> <b>Snowy</b> Plover, and White-tailed Kite.|$|R
6000|$|The sparrow, {{like the}} poor, {{we have always}} with us, and on windy days even the large-sized rook is blown about the murkiness which does duty for sky over London; and on such {{occasions}} its coarse, corvine dronings seem not unmusical, nor without something of a tonic effect on our jarred nerves. And here the ordinary Londoner has got {{to the end of}} his ornithological list--that is to say, his winter list. He knows nothing about those wind-worn waifs, the [...] "occasional visitors" [...] to the metropolis--the pilgrims to distant Meccas and Medinas that have fallen, overcome by weariness, at the wayside; or have encountered storms in the great aerial sea, and lost compass and reckoning, and have been lured by false lights to perish miserably at the hands of their cruel enemies. It may be true that gulls are seen on the Serpentine, that woodcocks are flushed in Lincoln's Inn Fields, but the citizen who goes to his office in the morning and returns after the lamps have been lighted, does not see them, and they are nothing in his life. Those who concern themselves to chronicle such incidents might just as well, for all that it matters to him, mistake their species, like that bird-loving but unornithological correspondent of the Times who wrote that he had seen a flock of golden orioles in Kensington Gardens. It turned out that what he had seen were wheatears, or they might draw a little on their imaginations, and tell of sunward-sailing cranes encamped on the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral, flamingoes in the Round Pond, <b>great</b> <b>snowy</b> <b>owls</b> in Westminster Abbey, and an ibis--scarlet, glossy, or sacred, according to fancy--perched on Peabody's statue, at the Royal Exchange.|$|R
50|$|The <b>snowy</b> <b>owl</b> (Bubo scandiacus) is a large, white owl of {{the typical}} <b>owl</b> family. <b>Snowy</b> <b>owls</b> are native to Arctic regions in North America and Eurasia. Males are almost all white, while females have more flecks of black plumage. Juvenile <b>snowy</b> <b>owls</b> have black {{feathers}} until they turn white. The <b>snowy</b> <b>owl</b> is a ground nester that predominantly hunts rodents.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Snowy</b> <b>owls</b> are {{not known}} to interbreed with other owl species in the wild, and {{accordingly}} no hybrids of <b>snowy</b> <b>owls</b> and other owl species have yet been sighted in the wild. However, a hobby falconer in Kollnburg, Germany, managed to successfully breed hybrids from a male <b>snowy</b> <b>owl</b> and a female Eurasian eagle-owl in 2013. [...] The two resulting male hybrid owls possessed the prominent ear tufts (generally absent in <b>snowy</b> <b>owls),</b> general size, orange eyes, and {{the same pattern of}} black markings on their plumage from their Eurasian eagle-owl mother, while retaining the generally black-and-white plumage colours from their <b>snowy</b> <b>owl</b> father. The hybrids were dubbed [...] "Schnuhus", a portmanteau of the German words for <b>snowy</b> <b>owl</b> and Eurasian eagle-owl (Schnee-Eule and Uhu, respectively), which suggests that the English equivalent might be [...] "Snogle Owl." [...] As of 2014, the hybrids had grown to maturity and were healthy.|$|R
50|$|In January 2009, a <b>snowy</b> <b>owl</b> {{appeared}} in Spring Hill, Tennessee, the first reported sighting {{in the state}} since 1987. Also notable is the mass southern migration {{in the winter of}} 2011/2012, when thousands of <b>snowy</b> <b>owls</b> were spotted in various locations across the United States. This was then followed by an even larger mass southern migration in 2013/2014 with the first <b>snowy</b> <b>owls</b> seen in Florida for decades.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Snowy</b> <b>Owl</b> (Bubo scandiacus) is an Arctic breeder that {{regularly}} migrates to and winters in southern Canada {{and the northern}} United States (Parmalee 1992). The number of <b>Snowy</b> <b>Owls</b> moving south and the extent and timing of southward movements in any one year {{are believed to be}} dependent on interactions between populations of <b>Snowy</b> <b>Owls</b> and lemmings, the owls’ principal food resource (Parmalee 1992). Infrequently, relatively large numbers of <b>Snowy</b> <b>Owls</b> are observed in areas or regions where few are typically observed, and individuals are observed well south of the normal winter range. These occurrences are often referred to as “invasions” or “irruptions. ” The <b>Snowy</b> <b>Owl</b> is considered regular, albeit rare, in Nebraska (Sharpe et al. 2001) with a small number (3 ̆c 5) reported annually or nearly so. Invasions have been noted in the past, such as in the winter of 1917 – 18 and the winter of 1954 – 55. As noted elsewhere, the winter of 2011 – 12 was a major invasion year and the first in Nebraska in which electronic media, such as Internet Listservs and email, improved communication and reporting of observations. The purpose of this note is to summarize the 2011 – 12 <b>Snowy</b> <b>Owl</b> invasion...|$|R

Although PTT operational time was significantly shorter than expected lifetime of <b>Snowy</b> <b>Owls,</b> five owls were observed alive after transmissions ceased.
