500|$|Kunis {{supports}} the Democratic Party and Barack Obama. In a 2012 interview, she criticized the Republican Party, saying: [...] "The way that Republicans attack women is so offensive to me. And {{the way they}} talk about religion is offensive. <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> a practicing Jew, but why we gotta talk about Jesus all the time?" ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title track}} was {{described}} by Lewis as her [...] "thinly veiled way {{of getting out of}} writing a strictly 'confessional' song," [...] Lewis told Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune. [...] "I may be a liar, or <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> one." [...] The song also referenced a childhood experience of Lewis', in which she experienced LSD at the age of 14.|$|E

500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, He wants you to grow and He wants {{you to have a}} purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live {{in such a way that}} I have the purpose that John had".|$|E

2500|$|In general, <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> all of R as {{for example}} {{for an open}} disc in R2. The proof of this theorem follows from the theory of [...] {{ordinary}} differential equations, by noticing that the geodesic equation is a second-order ODE. Existence and uniqueness then follow from the PicardLindelöf theorem for the solutions of ODEs with prescribed initial conditions. γ depends smoothly on both p andV.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to his {{departure}} from Taipei, Aquino gave an interview from his {{room at the}} Grand Hotel in which he indicated {{that he would be}} wearing a bulletproof vest. He advised the journalists that would be accompanying him on the flight: [...] "You have to be ready with your hand camera because this action can become very fast. In a matter of 3 or 4 minutes it could be all over, and <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to talk to you again after this." [...] His last few moments in the flight while being interviewed by the journalist Jim Laurie, and just prior to disembarking from the flight at Manila airport, were recorded on camera.|$|E
2500|$|This type of causal {{foreseeability}} is to {{be distinguished}} from foreseeability of extent or kind of injury, which {{is a question of}} remoteness of damage, not causation. [...] For example, if I conduct welding work on a dock that lights an oil slick that destroys a ship a long way down the river, {{it would be hard to}} construe my negligence as anything other than causal of the ship's damage. [...] There is no novus actus interveniens. [...] However, <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> held liable if that damage is not of a type foreseeable as arising from my negligence: The Wagon Mound (No 1) [...] AC 388 (Privy Council). [...] That is a question of public policy, and not one of causation.|$|E
2500|$|Reviewers wrote, and Miller later confirmed, that a {{recurring}} theme in the lyrics of Real Nighttime was life after college, which Miller paired with the intuition that [...] "freedom had a strong aspect of being bad news." [...] The song [...] "24" [...] placed the narrator at the cusp of a quarter-life crisis, as a self-conscious young adult whose mixed feelings established that he [...] "doesn't know where he fits, or to how to live on his own, in a post-collegiate milieu." [...] The theme continued with allusions to finding one's own direction and leaving the nest, as in [...] "Curse of the Frontier Land" [...] ("A year ago we called this a good time"), and [...] "I Mean It This Time" [...] ("Give me all the gin I need, for <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> this strong when I call my parents and tell them they've been wrong.") ...|$|E
5000|$|In the Grateful Dead's Scarlet Begonias, {{the line}} [...] "I ain't often right but I've never been wrong" [...] {{appears in the}} bridge—this {{is very similar to}} Goldwyn's [...] "I’m willing to admit that <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> always <b>be</b> right, but I am never wrong." ...|$|R

2500|$|Marcos wanted Aquino to {{stay out}} of politics, however Aquino {{asserted}} his willingness to suffer the consequences declaring, [...] "the Filipino is worth dying for." [...] He wished to express an earnest plea for Marcos to step down, for a peaceful regime change and a return to democratic institutions. Anticipating the worst, at an interview in his suite at the Taipei Grand Hotel, he revealed that he would be wearing a bullet-proof vest, but he also said that [...] "it's only good for the body, but in the head there's nothing else we can do." [...] Sensing his own doom, he told the journalists accompanying him on the flight, [...] "You have to be very ready with your hand camera because this action can become very fast. In a matter of a three or four minutes it could be all over, you know, and [...] <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to talk to you again after this." [...] His last televised interview, with journalist Jim Laurie, took place on the flight just prior to his assassination.|$|E

[...] At dahil first option si Bogs, pag na-double team siya, pak, pasa ang bola sa akin (And because Bogs was the first option, if he was double teamed, the pass will come to me).
