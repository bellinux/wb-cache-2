25|$|The {{medical history}} is a {{longitudinal}} record {{of what has happened}} to the patient since birth. It chronicles diseases, major and minor illnesses, as well as growth landmarks. It gives the clinician a <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> has happened before to the patient. As a result, it may often give clues to current disease state. It includes several subsets detailed below.|$|E
25|$|You stand {{convicted of}} the truly evil {{abduction}} and murder of a vulnerable young girl in 1991 and thereafter of attempting to defeat the ends of justice in various ways over an extended period... Yet again you have shown yourself to be unfit {{to live in a}} decent society. It is hard for me to convey the loathing and revulsion that ordinary people will <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> you have done... I fix the minimum period which you must spend in custody at 30 years. Had it been open to me I would have made that period run consecutive to the 21 year custodial period that you are already serving.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} photography, Brodovitch had a {{distinct}} <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> the magazine needed. He favored on-location fashion photography {{as opposed to}} the studio shots normally used in other fashion publications. He urged his photographers to look for jarring juxtapositions in their images. One such spread features a woman in a full-length Dior gown posed between two circus elephants. The cinematic effect, a trademark characteristic of his layouts, involved using photographs as if they were stills from a film. He would repeat a pose or a dress several times across a spread to give a narrative, temporal feeling. At times, Brodovitch would arbitrarily take a series of photographs and adopt a story line to go with them, as though recapping a movie. He was known to push this idea even further by adding film sprocket borders to photographs at times. Brodovitch also often emphasized spatial illusions, using type and photographs to create multiple perspectives within a space. The notion of mirroring and doubling also interested him, {{as can be seen in}} how he paired similar pictures on a spread or dividing halves of one image across the gutter of the page.|$|E

500|$|His formula was {{characterized}} by a CBS executive as [...] "broads, bosoms, and fun," [...] resulting in such shows as The Beverly Hillbillies and Gilligan's Island, despised by the critics– and CBS chairman William S. Paley– but extremely popular with viewers. While Aubrey had a great <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> would be successful with viewers, he had nothing but contempt for them. [...] "The American public is something I fly over," [...] he said. [...] His former boss at ABC, Oliver E. Treyz, said at programming [...] "Jim Aubrey {{was one of the}} most effective ever, from the standpoint of delivering what the public wanted and making money. He was the best program judge in the business." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to acting in films, Chopra {{is active in}} charity work and supports a number of causes. She walked the ramp at the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week to support the Shabana Azmi Mijwan Welfare Society, an NGO dedicated to empowering girls. Chopra said, [...] "I don't {{want it to be}} just about ramp walk, but I seriously and genuinely <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> Mijwan and what Manish and Shabanaji are doing. For such an initiative, I just could not say no. I had {{to be a part of}} it." [...] She also appeared on NDTV's Greenathon, an initiative to support eco-friendliness and investigate poor electricity supplies in rural villages, to lend her support. Apart from charity work, she serves as an ambassador for a number of brands. Chopra endorses brands such as Kurkure, Nivea, Maaza and Spinz, WeChat, Pantene and Mahindra scooty. She became the first Bollywood star to endorse products from both Coke (Maaza) and PepsiCo (Kurkure) at the same time.|$|E
500|$|While {{majoring in}} finance, Youkilis excelled {{as a player}} for the Cincinnati Bearcats from 1998 to 2001. [...] "I take no credit", said Cleary. [...] "He coaches himself. He knows his swing. Any time we said {{anything}} to him, he was already a step ahead. He made the adjustments he had to make. I just think he's a really smart guy who had a great <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> he had to do." [...] In his junior year in 2000, he was a second-team All-American and first-team All-Conference USA, as he set school records by hitting three home runs in one game and 19 for the season; still, he went undrafted. [...] "He {{was kind of a}} square-shaped body, a guy [...] in a uniform didn't look all that athletic", Cleary said. [...] "He wasn't a tall, prospect-y looking guy. He looked chubby in a uniform. ... It wasn't fat. He was strong. [...] I think the body did scare some people away." ...|$|E

500|$|Hall was in New York City and {{thinking}} {{of going back to}} theatre work, and had no intention of returning to television so quickly. However, he changed his mind after reading the script, because he was [...] "intrigued by the macabre mix of dark humor, chilling violence, and a unique central character." [...] He also said that he [...] "realized it was a big commitment and certainly appreciated that coming off of Six Feet Under" [...] but said that he [...] "couldn't pass it up". Lindsay was initially against casting Hall, based on seeing him on Six Feet Under, but after he saw Hall speak one line of the script, Lindsay changed his mind, describing Hall as [...] "absolutely perfect" [...] to portray Dexter. To prepare for the part, Hall read various books on the psychology of serial killers, read transcripts of interviews with serial killers, and spent time with the head blood-spatter analyst at the Miami precinct. He also watched people in New York restaurants to get a <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> {{it would be like to}} stalk them.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Tom Sinclair {{considered}} {{that while the}} record was not ground-breaking, [...] "the Foos {{have found a way}} to create their own archetype, with an instinctive <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> constitutes a killer song", and praised [...] "how damn near flawless the tone of the whole set feels". Rolling Stones David Fricke praised the sonic variety, described by him as [...] "an anthology of strong new songs by a great bunch of bands, all calling themselves Foo Fighters". Jessica Letkemann of Billboard was acceptive of the [...] "delicious sundown grooves" [...] of the quieter piece and [...] "the Foos' usual soft-louder-loudest 'radio friendly unit shifters'" [...] - referencing a track of Nirvana's In Utero – while considering [...] "Home" [...] the only disappointing track. Robert Christgau rated the album a B, describing it as a [...] "candid attempt to recapitulate Nirvana Mark II's 10-year-old triumph, The Colour and the Shape". Henrik Holmgren of Melodic praised the production of the album and felt that Grohl singing [...] "gets better and better with every record." [...] Dave Simpson of The Guardian called Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace the band's [...] "most accomplished album", praising the composition and saying that [...] "Gil Norton's stunning production can't disguise the raw humanity beneath the sheen".|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{these years}} KFJC {{was run by}} {{students}} who were in a 2-year broadcasting program. [...] After 2 years in the program, the student was obliged to [...] "move on" [...] {{to make room for}} incoming students. [...] Approximately 80 new students signed up for the on-air class every year during this time. The program director and music director maintained a mostly Progressive-Rock format, using a [...] "clock" [...] showing when on-air breaks were to be taken and what announcements were to occur during those breaks i.e. The Entertainment Calendar, PSAs, or promos for the many station benefits that the staff organized. [...] The clock gave students the <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> professional stations would ask them to follow.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his book}} The Storm, Cable writes, [...] "The trigger {{for the current}} global {{financial}} crisis was the US mortgage market and, indeed, the scale of improvident and unscrupulous lending {{on that side of}} the Atlantic dwarfs into insignificance the escapades of our own banks." [...] In an interview about the book, Cable was asked whether he had warned about this. Cable replied, [...] "No, I didn’t. That’s quite true." [...] He continued, [...] "But you’re quite right, and one of the problems of being a British MP is that you do tend to get rather parochial and I haven’t been to the States for years and years, so I wouldn’t claim to have any <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> <b>what’s</b> been going on there." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Bourdon, the Good Spirit has, at last, {{made himself}} heard. His whisper is so low, {{that at first}} my ears did not hear him. They hear him now. When he spoke loudest, {{it was with the}} tongue of the medicine-priest of your people. He was about to die. When we are about to die, our voices become strong and clear. So do our eyes. We see what is before, and we see what is behind. We <b>feel</b> joy <b>for</b> <b>what</b> is before--we <b>feel</b> sorrow <b>for</b> <b>what</b> is behind. Your medicine-priest spoke well. It sounded in my ears as if the Great Spirit, himself, was talking. They say it was his Son. I believe them. Blossom has read to me out of the good book of your people, and I find it is so. I feel like a child, and could sit down, in my wigwam, and weep.|$|R
2500|$|Roger Ebert praised Susan Sarandon's {{performance}} {{in his review}} for the Chicago Sun-Times: [...] "I don't know who else they could have hired to play Annie Savoy, the Sarandon character who pledges her heart and her body to one player a season, but I doubt if the character would have worked without Sarandon's wonderful performance". In his review for Sports Illustrated, Steve Wulf wrote, [...] "It's a good movie and a damn good baseball movie". Hal Hinson, in his review for The Washington Post, wrote, [...] "The people associated with Bull Durham know the game ... and the firsthand experience shows in their easy command of the ballplayer's vernacular, in their <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> goes through a batter's head when he digs in at the plate and in {{their knowledge of the}} secret ceremonies that take place on the mound". Richard Corliss, in his review for Time, wrote, [...] "Costner's surly sexiness finally pays off here; abrading against Sarandon's earth-mama geniality and Robbins' rube egocentricity, Costner strikes sparks".|$|E
2500|$|While at {{the middle}} of the series in length, the film Half-Blood Prince did add or change events in the {{literary}} canon. The book begins with a scene involving the Muggle Prime Minister. Yates and his crew debated over this scene, as well as the character Rufus Scrimgeour, but gave up the beginning of the movie to events described but not seen in the book. Yates thought it would give the audience a <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> the Death Eaters were doing if they showed the collapse of the Millennium Bridge rather than simply describe it (as was done with the Brockdale Bridge in the book). As with Goblet of Fire, the Dursleys were cut, which Steve Kloves did to [...] "break the pattern". Further background of Tom Riddle was removed, such as the Gaunts because they felt it more important to concentrate on Riddle as a young boy, and an additional action scene at the Burrow was added to keep with the tone of the franchise. Yates felt that they needed [...] "an injection of jeopardy and danger" [...] and that without it there was too much comedy and lightness. A small battle scene at Hogwarts which happened during {{the end of the book}} was cut; Heyman commented that it was removed to [...] " [...] repetition" [...] with the forthcoming adaptation of the Battle of Hogwarts in Deathly Hallows. Dumbledore's funeral was removed as it was believed it did not fit with the rest of the film.|$|E

Rina is a very emotional person and depends a lot on Masashi (as Yuna) for support and guidance.|$|R

60|$|Thousandacres {{called to}} his {{daughter}} in an authoritative way; and I soon heard the girl's step, as she came, a little hesitatingly, as I fancied, into the mill.

6000|$|... "At any rate," [...] she answered, [...] "there it is. And now, Colonel Quaritch, {{one word}} before I go in.

60|$|After {{wandering}} about {{round the}} house and through the grounds, for above an hour, Barry returned, half sobered, to the room; but, in his present state of mind, he could not go to bed sober. He ordered more hot water, and again sat down alone to drink, and drown the remorse {{he was beginning to}} <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> he had done--or rather, not remorse, but the feeling of fear that every one would know how he had treated Anty, and that they would side with her against him. Whichever way he looked, all was misery and disappointment to him, and his only hope, for the present, was in drink. There he sat, for a long time, with his eyes fixed on the turf, till it was all burnt out, trying to get fresh courage from the spirits he swallowed, and swearing to himself {{that he would not be}} beat by a woman.|$|E

But unfortunately, there are scoundrels everywhere. These men have been punished as they deserved, and the whole army will join with me in deep regret at what has happened, and in the fervent hope that your father's life will be spared. I grieve, too, to hear that the countess, your mother, has suffered so greatly from the shock; and hope soon to be able to express to her, in person, the regret I <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> has taken place.' ...|$|E
