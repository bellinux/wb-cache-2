50|$|The {{infection}} cannot {{easily be}} removed mechanically, although further proliferation of infection {{can be achieved}} by avoidance of moisture. Removal generally involves cutting or shaving of the hair, but chemical treatments may be similarly useful. For women some individuals use a <b>fine</b> <b>comb</b> to remove as much of the infection as possible and then they cut or shave their hair. This is then followed by the application of a sublimate solution in 60% alcohol solution to the scalp. Historical treatments have used alcoholic tinctures of heavy metals, such as mercury bichloride. The application of antifungal shampoos such as pyrithione zinc, formaldehyde and salicylic acid is effective against black piedra. Oral therapy with itraconazole or terbinafine also causes nodules to break down over time. Removal of affected hair and treatment with topical agents is also effective and results in very low recurrences rates.

40|$|A compact fiber-optic vector {{magnetometer}} {{based on}} directional scattering between polarized plasmon waves and ferro-magnetic nanoparticles is demonstrated. The sensor configuration {{reported in this}} work uses a short section of tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) coated with a nanometer scale gold film and packaged with a magnetic fluid (Fe 3 O 4) inside a capillary. The transmission spectrum of the sensor provides a <b>fine</b> <b>comb</b> of narrowband resonances that overlap with a broader absorption of the surface plasmonresonance (SPR). The wavelength of the SPR attenuation in transmission shows high sensitivity to slight perturbations by magnetic fields, due to the strong directional scattering between the SPR attenuated cladding modes and the magnetic fluid near the fiber surface.

40|$|An ultra-thin silver-coated tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) sensor {{with clear}} surface plasmon {{resonance}} (SPR) together with strong evanescent wave in transmission for "surface" and "bulk" surrounding refractive index (SRI) measurement is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The {{thickness of the}} silver coating over the fiber surface is precisely controlled at 1216 nm (much thinner than 4050 nm for traditional SPR excitation). The transmission spectrum of the sensor provides a <b>fine</b> <b>comb</b> of narrowband resonances that overlap with the broader absorption of the surface plasmon and thus provide a unique tool to measure small shifts of the plasmon and identify the "surface" SRI changes with high accuracy. Meanwhile, the ultra-thin nanometric-coating permits part of high-order cladding modes to become leaky modes which have a large sensitivity to variations in the background solution for "bulk" SRI measurement. Experimental results show that above two resonances have an inverse amplitude responses to the SRI changing. Biological solutions (urine of rats with different concentration of Aquaporin) with different RI ranging from 1. 3400 to 1. 3408 were clearly discriminated in-situ by using the differential amplitude monitoring between "cut-off" cladding resonance and plasmonic resonance, with an amplitude variation sensitivity of 8100 dB/RIU and a limit of detection of 10 - 5 RIU.

5000|$|Dressing is {{the broad}} term {{referring}} to removing the fibers from the straw and cleaning {{it enough to}} be spun. Dressing consists of three steps: breaking, scutching and heckling. After breaking, some of the straw is scraped from the fibers in the scutching process, then the fiber is pulled through various sized heckling combs, or hackles. Different sized heckling combs are used, progressing from coarser combs {{with only a few}} prongs or nails per inch, to <b>finer</b> <b>combs.</b> Generally three heckling combs are used; however, many more can be used. The finer the final heckling <b>comb,</b> the <b>finer</b> the yarn spun from that flax can be. An example of a progression of five combs is first using a heckling comb with four nails per square inch, then one with 12 per inch, then 25, next 48, and finally 80 nails per inch. The first three remove the straw, and the last two split and polish the fibers.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{the exact}} method {{depends on the}} school, Five Ancestors {{is known for its}} large variety of power generational methods.

Some schools teach tension forms that develop power, of which there are about ten, and fist forms that train technique, of which there are dozens. Others stress a relaxed body, instead seeking maximum transmission of the relevant jin. For the He Yang (‰ΩïÈò≥)branch/School, these 2 extremes are represented by the Lu Wanding/Lo Ban Teng (ÁõßËê¨ÂÆö) lineages representing the earlier. The teaching of Lu style is mostly in Indonesia (in the city of Jakarta and Surakarta/Solo). The latter is represented by the latter teaching of Shen Yangde/Sim Yang Tek (Ê≤àÊâ¨Âæ≥) whose style evolved from more direct in the earlier teaching In Xiamen to the [...] "seeking maximum transmission of the relevant jin"when he had moved to Singapore. The Surakarta/Solo branch has a unique execution as it integrates the Lu and the earlier Shen's teaching. The style was popularized in solo by Lin Shui Gang/Liem Tjoei Kang (ÊûóÁ≤πÂàö) who was the nephew of Lu as well as an adopted son of Shen. In the surface, it seems to be counter-intuitive to integrate two opposite spectrum of teaching.

40|$|Extract] In {{developed}} {{market economies}} pediculosis causes angst {{which is far}} {{out of proportion to}} its clinical significance. Control has used a biomedical approach, based on the biology of head lice, dispelling myths with evidence and unifying recommendations. Topical insecticides have been the major intervention until the last decade when use of hair conditioner and physical removal of lice using <b>fine</b> tooth <b>combs</b> has been promoted. However, the anxiety provoked by head lice in developed market economies has not been addressed in a systematic way at the population level. Since the socio-emotional area is arguably the major impact of pediculosis in developed market economies, failure to deal with this aspect is a major deficiency in control strategies. The most prominent differences between head lice control in developing countries and developed market economies are that in the former emotional reactions to head lice are far less important...|$|R
60|$|In {{the ancient}} country of Orn, there lived {{an old man}} who was called the Bee-man, because his whole time was spent in the company of bees. He lived in a small hut, which was nothing more than an immense bee-hive, for these little creatures had built their {{honeycombs}} in every corner of the one room it contained, on the shelves, under the little table, all about the rough bench on which the old man sat, and even about the head-board and along the sides of his low bed. All day the air of the room was thick with buzzing insects, but this did not interfere in any way with the old Bee-man, who walked in among them, ate his meals, and went to sleep, without the slightest fear of being stung. He had lived with the bees so long, they had become so accustomed to him, and his skin was so tough and hard, that the bees no more thought of stinging him than they would of stinging a tree or a stone. A swarm of bees had made their hive in a pocket of his old leathern doublet; and when he put on this coat to take one of his long walks in the forest in search of wild bees' nests, he was very glad to have this hive with him, for, if he did not find any wild honey, he would put his hand in his pocket and take out a piece of a comb for a luncheon. The bees in his pocket worked very industriously, and he was always certain of having something to eat with him wherever he went. He lived principally upon honey; and when he needed bread or meat, he carried some <b>fine</b> <b>combs</b> to a village not far away and bartered them for other food. He was ugly, untidy, shrivelled, and brown. He was poor, and the bees seemed to be his only friends. But, for all that, he was happy and contented; he had all the honey he wanted, and his bees, whom he considered the best company in the world, were as friendly and sociable as they could be, and seemed to increase in number every day.|$|R
50|$|The {{rectilinear}} comb uses a circular comb {{mounted on a}} drum to comb out the fringe and remove short fiber (set by a scale so fibers less than, for example, 25 mm are removed) not held by a clamping mechanism. The row of pins known as a top comb is a very <b>fine</b> tooth <b>comb,</b> for example 25 teeth per inch; it is inserted in cylindrical combed fringe {{to act as an}} impediment to contaminates (burr, seed etc.) flow. The top comb acts as an impediment to contamination moving into a combed sliver. On a next circular <b>combing</b> short <b>finer</b> and contaminates are removed. The circular combing without short fibers are placed on a moving belt in an overlapping motion. The circular combing and top comb insertion is repeated and combed fibers - now called tuft are overlapped. The overlapping produces some cohesion allowing the tuft then to be twisted to form a combed sliver. This sliver is weak and unsuitable for spinning. To allow spinning to take place additional gilling is required to introduce fiber end irregularity (Sokolov 1994).|$|R

40|$|Impact of the ginning method on fiber {{quality and}} textile {{processing}} performance of Long Staple Upland cotton Marinus HJ van der Sluijs 1, 2 With the {{increased demand for}} quality {{and the production of}} finer, longer and stronger Upland cottons, an increasing proportion of these cottons are ginned on roller gins to preserve and improve fiber quality. However, although the benefits of roller ginning on lint turn out and fiber quality are fairly well understood, it is still unclear whether these improvements translate into improved yarn quality and processing performance. The aim of this research was to com-pare the impact of saw and roller ginning on Long Staple Upland cotton in a high-production and commercial environ-ment and to evaluate quality and textile processing performance in a commercial textile mill. One field located within the central cotton growing area of Australia was planted with a Long Staple Upland variety, with a number of round modules selected at random from the field and processed by a saw and a rotary knife roller gin. There was {{a significant difference between the}} two ginning methods in some of the average fiber results, with the roller ginned fiber longer and more uniform with fewer short fibers and fibrous neps, as well as stronger with higher elongation. These improved fiber properties resulted in significant differences in the <b>fine</b> count <b>combed</b> hosiery ring spun yarn produced. On average the yarn spun from roller ginned cotton was significantly more even with fewer total imperfections, although there was no significant difference in yarn count, strength, elongation and hairiness.

40|$|The {{business}} case for advancing more women into leadership is clear for companies globally. Whilst {{this is an}} issue of equality, it‚Äôs also about accessing markets, productivity and economic opportunity. ANZ has made good progress: three women sit on our Management Board; 38 % of all management roles and 24 % of our most senior executive positions are held by women; and females lead key global businesses and countries in our super regional growth strategy. However, further gains are now hard won and largely incremental. Looking at the results of EOWA‚Äôs 2012 Australian Census of Women in Leadership, it seems we are not alone. Given the high proportion of Australian women with a tertiary education - and indeed placed within junior and middle management ranks - the Census results demonstrate the pace of progression is far too slow. Extensive local and international research tells us there is no ‚Äòsilver bullet‚Äô. In fact, I believe as CEOs and business leaders our approach must now focus on gender balancing our businesses with a <b>fine</b> tooth <b>comb.</b> We need to go beyond high level targets, discrete programs and initiatives and engage women and men in this major opportunity. For example, at ANZ we are working to ensure women have access to a breadth of critical experiences and development opportunities throughout their careers to position them well for senior executive roles into the future. We have set targets for at least 40 % female representation amongst participants in our key recruitment, talent and development programs, in addition to our medium term goal to achieve at least 40 % representation of women in management overall. More broadly, senior women consistently cite an inclusive and supportive line manager as a defining factor in their progression. It follows that if we want more women in our senior ranks, constructive, inclusive and supportive leaders should become the norm in Australian business rather than the exception. Flexible work options assist in helping people balance their caring responsibilities and other commitments. But there‚Äôs more we can do to role model and promote flexibility, especially as such practices also build a more agile, productive and capable workforce. I recommend this report to all business leaders and urge all executives and directors to accept accountability for ensuring the next Census delivers better results...|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of people {{throughout}} the world have naturally kinky hair that may be very difficult to manage. These people often subject their hair to vigorous and harsh treatment processes in order to straighten it and hence make it more manageable. Hair braiding is a popular and fashionable trend amongst many people, in particular people of African descent. Braided hairstyles serve to preserve hair and protect it, and to give it time to rejuvenate after a period of harsh treatment. During the braiding process synthetic hair is attached to natural hair by weaving a length of the natural hair into one end of each braid. Other materials like wool or cotton may be use used to achieve different hairstyles and textures. Several strands of natural hair are used to secure each braid. The braids are normally left intact for a number of weeks or even months. Although braiding is a helpful African hair grooming practice, the process of taking down or detangling the braids is labor intensive and entails each braid being cut just below where the natural hair ceases and the natural hair being untangled from the braid using a safety pin, a needle or a <b>fine</b> toothed <b>comb.</b> The labor and long hours required to detangle braided hairstyles often results in braid wearers frustratingly pulling on their braided hair. This behavior inevitably destroys the hair follicle and leaves the hair damaged. According to a study conducted by the University of Cape Town‚Äôs dermatology department, braiding may be the root cause of traction alopecia (TA) amongst braid wearers. Traction alopecia is a form of alopecia, or gradual hair loss that is caused primarily by excessive pulling forces applied to the hair. The purpose of this current study was to investigate the factors, other than braid tightness, that affect the way and ease with which braids are detangled from the human hair. The study hypothesized that frictional forces present in braided hair were amongst these factors. It was hypothesized that introducing a lubricating formulation in the braids would allow for easier braid detangling. In order to decrease the prevalence of traction alopecia from braided hair, two hair strengthening actives were included in the test formulation. The study investigated the effects of the test formulations on braid detangling, hair friction and on the tensile strength of human hair. The study found that the method used did not pick up any significant differences between the braid detangling forces of treated braids when compared to the braid vi detangling forces of untreated hair. The same method used to measure braid detangling forces was able to show that there are variations in the braid detangling forces of different sections along the braid length. The method to measure braid detangling was based on the principles of hair combability measurements. The study also found that although the method used to measure braid detangling forces was unsuccessful in picking up significant differences in braid detangling forces of treated hair and untreated hair, the method used to measure the frictional forces of human hair showed that the frictional forces of hair treated with test formulations were significantly different than that of untreated hair. The method used to measure frictional forces was based on the capstan approach. The Capstan method measures the forces required to slide a weighted hair fibre over a curved surface of reference material. The interaction between the weighted fibre and the reference material simulates the movement of hair out of a braid ensemble in the braid detangling process. The optimum mixture with the minimum coefficient of friction, predicted a coefficient of friction of 0. 61 ¬± 0. 04. The optimum formulation was found to be one that contained 30 % Cyclopentasiloxane, 0 % PEG- 12 Dimethicone, 10 % 18 -MEA, 29 % water, 10 % hair strengthening actives, 12. 86 % emulsifier combination and 8 % other oils. The study also showed that including hair strengthening actives, such as hydrolysed proteins had significant effects in the tensile strength properties of chemically treated African hair...|$|R
