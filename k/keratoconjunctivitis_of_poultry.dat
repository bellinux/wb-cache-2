40|$|Vaccination {{of highly}} {{pathogenic}} avian influenza (HPAI) {{is one of}} the control measures in poultry farm. There are several factors determining farmer’s decision on the implementation of this vaccination. They are the type <b>of</b> <b>poultry,</b> the experience <b>of</b> farmers in the poultry farm, the pattern <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> farm management, the role <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> farm on household income, the scale <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> farm, the mortality rate <b>of</b> <b>poultry,</b> the cost <b>of</b> medication, and the case of HPAI. The analysis result showed that two factors namely type <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> and the role <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> farm on household income had significant influence on farmer’s decision to implement HPAI vaccination. In fact, the implementation of HPAI vaccination would be more effective in independent farms since the risk of this disease was single-handedly borne by farmers. Apart from that, the implementation of HPAI vaccination would also be more effective in farms that had never been infected by HPAI, particularly layer farms. Overall, HPAI vaccination would be more effectively implemented through supporting biosecurity measures in poultry farms...|$|R

The study covered the population <b>of</b> 275 <b>poultry</b> farmers in the State. The objectives were to ascertain the level of entrepreneurial traits <b>of</b> <b>Poultry</b> farmers and to determine the distribution <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> farm entrepreneurs by category, namely; low, average and high potential, across the three agricultural zones. The hypotheses tested were that entrepreneurial traits <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> farmers were not above average {{and that there was}} no significant variation in poultry farmers’ entrepreneurial potentials across the three agricultural zones. Primary data were collected using copies of a structured questionnaire. By using analysis of variance and test of differences between a test value of 3. 4, major findings were that poultry farmers were above average in three entrepreneurial traits but with significant variation across the zones; that entrepreneurial potential was generally below average, finally, that the three categories <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> farm entrepreneurs were randomly distributed across the zones.

The importance <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> production ultimately hinges on {{the demands of the}} consumers and the perceptions that drive their purchases. With this in mind, this study surveyed consumers to assess their perceptions <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> production in Arkansas. The instrument used to survey consumers was created by the researcher and an expert committee at the University of Arkansas.

40|$|Poultry {{production}} in eastern Croatia is developed by individual producers mainly in semi intensive way, {{and within the}} organized poultry systems where the process is organized in a modern, intensive way. There is a tradition of breeding hens and geese in this area. Poultry products - meat and eggs are important in supplying the population with animal protein, minerals and vitamins. Modern hybrid hens are used for egg production and for meat {{production in}} the intensive production. Today geese breeding in these areas are completely neglected. Croatia {{as a member of}} European Union, has possibility of the placement of autochthonous breeds <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> such as Hrvatica hen, Zagorje turkey and Podravian goose. Financial supports at the national level are allocated for the first two autochthonous breeds <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> because these breeds can, with good production traits, represent genetic resources and strategic reserves in the future development <b>of</b> domestic <b>poultry</b> genotypes. Poultry production is especial emphasis in accordance with the criteria of welfare and health <b>of</b> <b>poultry.</b> This paper discusses further development <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> in terms <b>of</b> production <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> meat and eggs as a functional food. The composition and content of nutricines in meat and eggs can be affected by feed composition. Desired nutricines are installed in muscular tissue <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> by using feed and adding some components. Consumption <b>of</b> eggs and <b>poultry</b> meat enriched by selenium, lutein and omega- 3 fatty acids affects the improvement {{of the quality of the}} human diet. The recent researches show that chicken can effectively be enriched in carnosine - ingredients that are now taught as “anti-aging” factor. Enrichment <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> products with nutricines gives greater importance to these foods in the diet of the population than the former one, mainly based on the nutritional aspect.

40|$|Utilization <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> litter {{has been}} a common {{practice}} in India since long time as manure. Poultry manure is rich organic manure since solid and liquid excreta are excreted together resulting in no urine loss. In deep litter manure, the litter absorbs moisture and helps keep the manure friable. In recent years, the problem <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> waste utilization in concentrated areas {{has been a}}ugmented by confined feeding operations {{as much of the}} manure produced now contains no litter. Litter is not used when birds are reared in cages. The nutritional value <b>of</b> fresh <b>poultry</b> manure deteriorates rapidly. Hence, the immediate processing <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> manure to prevent its rapid decomposition and save its nutrient properties is, thus essential. In addition, increased public consciousness of environmental pollution has challenged the animal and agricultural scientists to expand and to improve the disposal system, recycling the waste nutrients effectively, wherever feasible.
