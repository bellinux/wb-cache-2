500|$|After {{these shows}} were completed, Gorham {{confirmed}} that extended Thin Lizzy tours were probably {{a thing of}} the past, but that the band would continue to perform in one-off events. He stated, [...] "To kill it off stone dead <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>would</b> be the wrong thing." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the BBC, Thomas said that Morris and Beesley had been [...] "very adamant" [...] that the series had finished. On his co-stars, he added [...] "There is a bond there that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>would</b> be a stupid thing to waste. You don't get that bond very often with other performers and we do have it and it's a valuable thing".|$|E
500|$|... "Angry White Boy Polka", {{a medley}} of popular hit songs set to a polka beat, was {{recorded}} {{at the same time}} as the album's parodies. Yankovic explained, [...] " [...] is a reflection on what songs <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>would</b> sound most ridiculous done as a polka [...] and for the [...] album, it reflected a genre of music that I thought probably would benefit from getting a polka treatment." ...|$|E

500|$|Director Brad Bird {{stated in}} 2007 {{that he was}} open {{to the idea of}} a sequel if he could come up with an idea {{superior}} to the original film: [...] "I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together." [...] During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. [...] "I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have. Because I love those characters and love that world," [...] said Bird. [...] "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head. I have many, many elements that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>would</b> work really well in another Incredibles film, and if I can get ‘em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that." ...|$|E
500|$|A superhero {{with genuine}} superpowers {{who works for}} the U.S. government. Crudup plays Osterman in flashbacks as a human and is {{replaced}} for his post-accident scenes with a motion-capture CG version of himself. During filming, Crudup acted opposite his co-stars, wearing a white suit covered in blue LEDs, so he would give off an otherworldly glow in real life, just as the computer-generated Manhattan does in the movie. His body was modeled on that of fitness model and actor Greg Plitt. The crew then 3D-digitized Crudup's head and [...] "frankensteined it onto Greg Plitt's body." [...] Snyder chose not to electronically alter Crudup's voice for Manhattan, explaining the character [...] "would try and put everyone as much at ease as he could, instead of having a robotic voice that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>would</b> feel off-putting." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2014 Hero Complex Film Festival, Sigourney Weaver {{hinted that}} she'd be {{interested}} in returning {{to the role of}} Ripley, stating that Resurrection's ending [...] "feels incomplete to me. I wish it didn't, but it does. We left it hanging. And there's a way to finish this story that <b>i</b> <b>think</b> <b>would</b> be satisfying to me and the many fans." [...] She also stated regarding the hybrid character that [...] "Had we done a fifth one, I don't doubt that her humanity would have prevailed. I do feel like there is more story to tell. I feel a longing from fans for the story to be finished. I could imagine a situation where we finish telling the story." [...] She was quoted: [...] "I don't think Alien belongs on Earth popping out of a haystack, which is where I was afraid it was going to go. I feel it should take place in {{the far reaches of the}} universe where no one in their right mind would go. There are very few filmmakers that I can think of that I would want to entrust this to." ...|$|E

2500|$|The book {{comes with}} a 50-page text section, {{including}} a bibliography, footnotes and an appendix in 23 parts that argues for {{a system in which}} [...] "paying for sex is preferable to romance-based methods". [...] It includes some commentary by his friend and fellow cartoonist Seth, who disagrees with Brown's position and accuses him of having no emotions, but then goes on to say, [...] "The funny thing about Chester is that out of all the men I know he’s quite possibly the one <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>would</b> make the most considerate boyfriend or husband for a woman...and yet {{he is the one who}} picked the whoring." ...|$|E
2500|$|Darwin {{remarked to}} Lyell, [...] "I {{must be a}} very bad explainer... Several Reviews, & several letters have shown me too clearly how little I am understood. I suppose natural {{selection}} was bad term; but to change it now, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>would</b> make confusion worse confounded. Nor can I think of better; Natural preservation would not imply a preservation of particular varieties & would seem a truism; & would not bring man's & nature's selection under one point of view. I can only hope by reiterated explanations finally to make matter clearer." [...] It was too illegible for Lyell, and Darwin later apologised [...] "I am utterly ashamed & groan over my hand-writing. It was Natural Preservation. Natural persecution is what the author ought to suffer." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Jesse Katz, {{a former}} Los Angeles Times reporter, {{said of the}} LA Times coverage: [...] "As an L.A. Times reporter, we saw this series in the San Jose Mercury News and kind of wonder how legit it was and kind of put it under a microscope, {{and we did it}} in a way that most of us who were {{involved}} in it, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>would</b> look back on that and say it was overkill. We had this huge team of people at the L.A. Times and kind of piled on to one lone muckraker up in Northern California." [...] And [...] "we really didn't do anything to advance his work or illuminate much to the story, and it was a really kind of tawdry exercise. ... And it ruined that reporter's career." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 17 October 2008, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer {{reported}} that Ljungberg {{might be a}} part of the new Major League Soccer franchise Seattle Sounders FC. On 28 October 2008, Seattle Sounders officially announced they had signed Ljungberg as their Designated Player for the 2009 season. The terms of his contract saw Ljungberg earn $10 million over two seasons with the Sounders. Much like the contract of David Beckham and as is the norm for professional sports stars in the US, Ljungberg's contract assured that he kept all of the money derived from his private endorsements. Because of this, Grahame L. Jones of the Los Angeles Times was quick to compare Ljungberg with Beckham. Alexi Lalas stated, [...] "Eddie Vedder, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>would</b> have a better chance of making an impact at Seattle than Freddie Ljungberg". However, after the 2009 regular season Lalas acknowledged his initial skepticism but admitted he had changed his mind. [...] "For me he's the best DP signing, because of the way he plays in MLS." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, artist Matt Haley and Twin Peaks {{producer}} Bob Engels {{began work}} on a graphic novel continuation of the series, {{to be included in}} the [...] "Complete Mystery" [...] DVD box set. Haley stated: [...] "Bob and I had a number of discussions about what the story would be, I was keen to use whatever notes they had for the proposed third season. I really wanted this to be a literal 'third season' of the show. Bob told me they really wanted to get away from the high school setting, so after the resolution of the Cooper-BOB-possession plot point, they would have cut to something like 'Ten Years Later', and then shown us a Twin Peaks where Cooper had quit the FBI and had become the town pharmacist, Sheriff Truman had become a recluse, etc. He also mentioned they were going to have Sheryl Lee come back, this time as a redhead, and probably have her character killed by BOB again. There were also some vague ideas about BOB and Mike being from a planet made of creamed corn, something about Truman driving Mike backwards through the portal into the Black Lodge (which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>would</b> have been a really nice cinematic scene)." [...] Lynch vetoed the project, stating that he respected the effort but did not want to continue the story of Twin Peaks in any way.|$|E
2500|$|The London Government Act 1899 {{abolished}} the existing local authorities within the County of London and {{replaced them with}} 28 metropolitan boroughs. Among the bodies to be dissolved was the Court of Burgesses of the City of Westminster. William Burdett-Coutts, one of Westminster's members of parliament, brought forward an amendment to rename the proposed borough of Greater Westminster [...] to City of Westminster. This was intended to give [...] "recognition to the title which the area ... had possessed for over three and a half centuries". He felt that if the status was not retained for the new borough it [...] "must necessarily disappear altogether". The amendment was rejected by the government, however, with the First Lord of the Treasury, Arthur Balfour, believing it would be [...] "an anomaly which, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>would</b> be not unnaturally resented by other districts which are as large in point of population as Westminster, although doubtless not so rich in historical associations". The government eventually relented, with Balfour stating that [...] "as soon as the necessary arrangements under the London Government Act have been completed, there will be conferred on the borough of Westminster, as constituted under the Act, the title of city, originally conferred in the time of Henry VIII". Letters patent were duly issued granting the title of [...] "city" [...] to the newly created Metropolitan Borough of Westminster.|$|E
