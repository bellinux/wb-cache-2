C. tataria is an endemic species of the Pontic-Pannonic region, {{but it is also}} present in Italy, where it is localized in Friuli on a characteristic grassland formation, called "magredi". C. tataria is regarded as an endangered species. Leaf and root explants were subjected to plant regulator treatments, which invoked different morphogenic responses. Leaf explants produced more callus than root explants and a higher amount of callus was obtained with 1 mg l- 1 2, 4 -D in combination with 2 mg l- 1 Kin. Somatic embryogenesis was obtained in calli maintained in a delayed subculture regime on media containing BAP in combination with NAA.
