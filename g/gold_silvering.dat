40|$|Appearance of {{metallic}} colors, such as <b>gold,</b> <b>silver</b> and bronze, {{depends on}} chromaticity and glossiness of a surface. We aim {{to obtain the}} chromaticity region of <b>gold,</b> <b>silver,</b> and bronze by using CG simulated surfaces with various glossiness. The physical glossiness was defined by the intensity ratio of specular reflectance of the surface stimulus. The observer estimated degree of perceived glossiness, and also degree of <b>gold,</b> <b>silver,</b> or bronze appearance of the stimulus with a physical glossiness and a chromaticity. The {{results showed that the}} stimulus began to appear <b>gold,</b> <b>silver</b> or bronze at a certain chromaticity point only when the stimulus had glossiness. The chromaticity range, where <b>gold,</b> <b>silver</b> and bronze colors were observed, expanded as the degree of glossiness increased. Furthermore the ratio of the degree of <b>gold,</b> <b>silver</b> or bronze colors to that of glossiness of the stimulus was found to be different among the chromaticity points of the stimulus. This ratio was highest with highly saturated stimuli for gold and bronze colors, and with achromatic stimuli for silver color...|$|R
