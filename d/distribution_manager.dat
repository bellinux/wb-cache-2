Applying lean distribution concept helps to reduce distribution centres waste while maintains customer service level high. The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop a lean assessment model that enables <b>distribution</b> <b>managers</b> to measure and improve the leanness levels of their companies. A data driven analytical approach (i. e. factor analysis) is used to assess leanness quantitatively. A lean index score is calculated to benchmark the leanness level of four distribution companies based in Ireland and UK. Results recommend that special attention should be taken on simplifying distribution network structure, establishing long term suppliers’ collaboration, managing customer demand, improving storage space utilisation, and managing distribution operations more efficiently...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} simple three-class {{model in the}} Kaleckian {{tradition}} to investigate the implications of a dominant managerial class class for the dynamics of demand and <b>distribution.</b> <b>Managers</b> are hired by capitalists to supervise workers, but supervision results in surplus extraction and wage inequality. The adjustment of capacity utilization to accommodate goods market disequilibrium produces two distinct regimes {{with respect to the}} responsiveness of investment demand to profitability: a low investment–response regime, where effective demand is both wage–led and inequality–led; and a high investment–response regime, where demand is profit–led. In accordance with recent empirical evidence for the US, we then introduce distributive dynamics that hinge on inequality squeezing workers’ wage growth. We find that the low investment–responsiveness regime produces a stable demand–distribution equilibrium only if the wage squeeze effect is relatively small. On the other hand, an equilibrium in the high investment–response regime is saddle–path stable. The main distributional implication of the wage squeez...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The use of {{multiple}} channels {{is probably the most}} common distribution strategy nowadays. On the other hand, it also triggers certain challenges. Unfortunately, prior studies have provided few insights for insurance decision makers related to hybrid-channel conflict, especially in terms of exploring the causes {{of multiple}} channel conflict in an insurance sector and investigating the frequency of causes of channel conflict. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the hybrid-channel conflict factors and to assess the frequency of the factors that cause hybrid-channel conflict. The methods used in this study are Delphi and analytic hierarchy process (AHP). According to the results of this study, the intrachannel conflict is more serious than interchannel conflict. Furthermore, “differences in perception of reality used in joint decision making”, “using coercive powers”, and “incompatibility of goals ” are the three most important factors of overall causes. According to the finding, <b>distribution</b> <b>managers</b> can identify the causes of channel conflict and modify their distribution strategy to minimize channel conflict...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a theory of}} risk management in which the choices of managers over effort and risk are imperfectly monitored by outsiders. In a principal-agent framework, hedging can reduce extraneous noise in the variables outsiders observe or create opportuni-ties for self-dealing behavior. The model reproduces several empirical features commonly described as anomalous, in an optimal-contract setting. In equilibrium, the hedged dis-tribution of output is hump-shaped and asymmetric: first, for outputs close to the mode of the <b>distribution,</b> <b>managers</b> {{are more likely to}} do well and less likely to do poorly; sec-ond, managers hedge against large gains and increase the likelihood of large losses. The model accounts for the prevalence of linear compensation schemes and the relatively low performance-pay coefficients observed in managerial jobs. A simple linear contract is op-timal over states with large payoffs or when the manager has access to all, or nearly all, fair hedges and gambles. In the latter case, the optimal contract may feature no observable performance-pay, yet elicit some effort. Empirical implications for the detection of earn-ings management, risk controls, robust contracting and observed compensation schemes across industries are also examined...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the power {{framework}} in cooperative grain marketing channels. A power framework, consisting of reward, referent, expert, legitimate, information, political and social power was examined in this channel. The effects of the power structure were examined with respect to commitment and performance. ^ The hypotheses were tested by using a structural equations approach to establish the factor structure in this environment. The relationship between power, commitment and performance was examined to establish the fact that power affects commitment, which, in turn, affects performance. ^ A survey of patrons of Harvest States Cooperatives in North Dakota was taken. The existence of the power base structure was established. Power was found to affect commitment and a significant relationship to performance was identified. ^ Political power was the most important power base in this study. This established that participation in the cooperative was a key issue in the grain marketing environment. ^ These results indicate that the power framework is a useful tool in this channel of <b>distribution.</b> <b>Managers</b> may be able to increase their ability to influence member performance by assessing their power bases. ...|$|R
