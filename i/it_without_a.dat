5|$|During the 193536 season, Halcombe {{played in}} two matches, {{both at the}} start of the season. He took 0/100 against the Australian team, who were warming up for the 193536 tour of South Africa. Western Australia won by an innings and 249 runs. After taking match figures of 0/90 against the touring MCC, he was dropped for the {{remainder}} of the season, thereby ending <b>it</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> wicket. The following season was a similar tale. After taking match figures of 1/108 and 4/161 in two matches against the touring England team {{at the start of}} the summer, Halcombe was dropped for the remainder of the season.|$|E

5|$|Revolt also flared in {{neighbouring}} Kent. Sir Simon de Burley, a close {{associate of}} both Edward III {{and the young}} Richard, had claimed that a man in Kent, called Robert Belling, was an escaped serf {{from one of his}} estates. Burley sent two sergeants to Gravesend, where Belling was living, to reclaim him. Gravesend's local bailiffs and Belling tried to negotiate a solution under which Burley would accept a sum of money in return for dropping his case, but this failed and Belling was taken away to be imprisoned at Rochester Castle. A furious group of local people gathered at Dartford, possibly on 5 June, to discuss the matter. From there the rebels travelled to Maidstone, where they stormed the gaol, and then onto Rochester on 6 June. Faced by the angry crowds, the constable in charge of Rochester Castle surrendered <b>it</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> fight and Belling was freed.|$|E

There was strong opposition to the agreement in the East, and when in 1453, 14 years after the agreement, the promised military aid from the West still had not arrived and Constantinople fell to the Turks, neither Eastern Christians nor their new rulers wished union between them and the West.|$|E
25|$|The Treasury Department {{engaged the}} {{consulting}} firm Coopers and Lybrand {{to conduct the study}} in 1997, which confirmed the Mint's demand, seigniorage and numismatic profit projections for the program. Among other conclusions, the study found that 98 million Americans were likely to save one or more full sets of the quarters (at the program's conclusion, the Mint estimated that 147 million Americans collected the 50 state quarters). Nevertheless, the Treasury Department continued to oppose the program and declined to proceed with <b>it</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> congressional mandate to do so.|$|E
25|$|During the Williamite War in Ireland Belfast {{changed hands}} twice. After being seized by Protestants during an {{uprising}} against {{the rule of}} the Catholic James II in 1689, it was captured by Richard Hamilton and the mainly Catholic Irish Army following the Break of Dromore. Later the same year a large Williamite expeditionary force arrived in Belfast Lough landing and taking the major towns of the area before laying siege to Carrickfergus. Belfast was captured by a detachment led by Henry Wharton after the Jacobites had abandoned <b>it</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> fight. Combined with their failure at the Siege of Derry, Schomberg's landing and march to Dundalk Camp led to the Jacobites withdrawing from most of Ulster and Belfast remained in Williamite hands {{to the end of the}} war.|$|E

500|$|Stefan Czarniecki {{was born}} in 1599 in the family estate of Czarnca by Włoszczowa in {{southern}} Poland in a szlachta (nobility) Czarniecki family. The date of his birth is only an assumption, as no documents exist to prove <b>it</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> doubt; most historians, as noted by historians Leszek Podhorodecki and Adam Kersten, accept the 1599 date, although historian Zdzisław Spieralski argued for 1604. His father, Krzysztof Czarniecki, was a soldier who participated in several wars in the late 16th and early 17th century, and eventually became a courtier to Polish queen Constance of Austria. Whereas historian Mirosław Nagielski notes that the Czarniecki family was not well off, which limited some of Stefan's life chances, Podhorecki points out that they owned several villages and even a small town, and the family wealth was [...] "not small". However, Stefan had ten siblings (he himself was the sixth out of nine brothers), and divided into that many parts, the family resources would be stretched rather thin. However, involvement with the queen's court allowed Krzysztof to boost his son's careers with the court influence, where they were often able to serve as young courtiers themselves.|$|E
500|$|Control of the Mississippi River {{was the key}} {{to victory}} in the Western theater. Believing Grant was a general of [...] "dogged persistence" [...] and [...] "iron will", Major General John C. Frémont {{assigned}} Grant to command troops on the Mississippi at Cairo, Illinois at the end of August (passing over generals John Pope and Benjamin Prentiss). Frémont dismissed rumors of Grant's drunkenness years earlier in the regular army, saying there was something about Grant's manner [...] "that was sufficient to counteract the influence of what they said." [...] Cairo was a bustling Union military and naval base that was to be used to launch a joint campaign down the Mississippi, Tennessee, and Cumberland Rivers. After the Confederates moved into western Kentucky, with designs on Southern Illinois, Grant, under Frémont's authority, advanced on Paducah, Kentucky, taking <b>it</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> fight, and set up a supply station. Having understood the importance to Lincoln in keeping Kentucky in the Union, Grant assured its citizens, [...] "I have come among you not as your enemy, but as your friend." [...] On November 1, Frémont ordered Grant to [...] "make demonstrations" [...] against the Confederates {{on both sides of the}} Mississippi, but prohibited him from attacking the enemy.|$|E

500|$|General Secretary Gorbachev said of {{his former}} rival's Cold War role: [...] " [...] {{a man who was}} {{instrumental}} in bringing {{about the end of the}} Cold War," [...] and deemed him [...] "a great president." [...] Gorbachev does not acknowledge a win or loss in the war, but rather a peaceful end; he said he was not intimidated by Reagan's harsh rhetoric. Margaret Thatcher, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, said of Reagan, [...] "he warned that the Soviet Union had an insatiable drive for military power... but he also sensed it was being eaten away by systemic failures impossible to reform." [...] She later said, [...] "Ronald Reagan had a higher claim than any other leader to have won the Cold War for liberty and he did <b>it</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> shot being fired." [...] Said Brian Mulroney, former Prime Minister of Canada: [...] "He enters history as a strong and dramatic player [...]" [...] Former President Lech Wałęsa of Poland acknowledged, [...] "Reagan was one of the world leaders who made a major contribution to communism's collapse." [...] That Reagan had little or no effect in ending the Cold War is argued with equal weight; that Communism's internal weakness had become apparent, and the Soviet Union would have collapsed in the end regardless of who was in power. President Harry S. Truman's policy of containment is also regarded as a force behind the fall of the USSR, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan undermined the Soviet system itself.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Goodbye Stranger", Castiel {{has been}} {{completely}} brainwashed by Naomi and has killed thousands of copies of Dean ruthlessly. Castiel is sent to find the angel tablet and tortures and kills the demons also looking for it, drawing Sam and Dean's attention. Sam and Dean track down someone who knows the location of one of Lucifer's Crypts where the angel tablet is and in ensuing scuffle, Sam ends up in trouble. Castiel saves Sam and captures one of the demons, claiming under Naomi's orders that he is searching {{for the second half}} of the demon tablet and that the demons are searching for a parchment that will allow them to translate <b>it</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> Prophet. Castiel tortures the demon who tells them where to find Meg, but kills her before she can reveal the truth to Sam and Dean. Castiel heads off alone and rescues Meg who explains what the demons really want. While Naomi initially wants her killed to prevent that, Castiel is able to make a case to keep her alive. The group then go to the warehouse where the crypt is and before heading inside with Dean, Castiel reveals that Sam is damaged by his trials on a level that even Castiel can't fix. Castiel and Dean locate the angel tablet and Castiel has to have Dean get it as it is warded against angels. However, Naomi orders Castiel to kill Dean and though he fights it, he has no control over his actions. As he is about to kill him, Dean manages to break through to Castiel's heart and he breaks free of Naomi's influence. He picks up the angel tablet which completely severs Naomi's connection to and control over him. Castiel heals Dean and explains what happened, but senses that he must now protect the tablet from everyone, even Dean. Castiel is later seen traveling on a bus to an unknown destination with the tablet. Despite losing the tablet, Naomi is somewhat satisfied as according to her, Castiel is doing what he is supposed to be doing. Naomi later comes to Dean. [...] In an attempt to gain his trust, presumably because she knows Castiel is one of his weak spots, she lies to Dean about Castiel and claims that he misinterpreted everything she has done and is still insane. Dean, of course, doesn't believe her. Despite this, Castiel is eventually captured by Naomi's forces, but the angel tablet is claimed by Crowley after one of Naomi's angels betrays their location, although this gives Castiel time to escape and reunite with the Winchesters after killing the angel guarding him.|$|E
