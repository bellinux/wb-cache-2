30|$|<b>Falls</b> <b>from</b> <b>heights</b> {{account for}} a {{significant}} percentage of urban trauma; these cases represent a distinctive mechanism of blunt trauma. It has been suggested that patients sustaining injuries <b>from</b> a <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> <b>height</b> have distinctive characteristics with an increased trauma severity and with different pattern of injuries in comparison with other mechanisms of blunt trauma [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 16]. A <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> <b>height</b> is associated with the most severe blunt injuries as compared with a motor vehicle crash or other mechanisms [2]. Nguyen-Thanh et al. [16] reported significant differences in ISS and the distribution of fractures when a <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> a <b>height</b> was compared with a motor vehicle accident. This study supports that blunt trauma <b>from</b> <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> <b>height</b> is more severe than other mechanisms of trauma.|$|R

5000|$|As {{members of}} the family Phasmidea, A. inermis grows by {{incomplete}} metamorphosis; it grows by a series of moults. Generally a stick insect will moult between five and ten times between hatching from the egg and mature adulthood. The life of a stick insect consists of four stages: Adults lay their ova (eggs) either by dropping them to the ground or depositing them within a suitable substrate. The ova are often hardy so they can withstand <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> <b>height</b> and the cold winter conditions they are often exposed to. The length of the egg stage can vary from as little as two weeks to over 18 months. After hatching from their eggs, nymphs quickly move to find a suitable vegetation that they can scale in order to find food in the form of leaves and the safety of the environment they are so well camouflaged for. Nymphs go through a series of moults before maturing to an adults which allows them to grow in the absence of their hard exoskeleton and also regenerate limbs that may have lost through a process called autotomy [...] Nymphs will generally eat their shed skin after a moult.Sub-adult stage refers to the final moult before being a true adult of its species. This is a short part of the life cycle and the last before the insect reaches the stage of reproduction ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Falls from height {{are one of}} {{the main}} causes of fatal {{occupational}} injuries. The objective {{of this study was to}} present a model for estimating occurrence probability of <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> <b>height.</b> Methods: In order to make a list of factors affecting falls, we used four expert group's judgment, literature review and an available database. Then the validity and reliability of designed questionnaire were determined and Bayesian networks were built. The built network, nodes and curves were quantified. For network sensitivity analysis, four types of analysis carried out. Results: A Bayesian network for assessment of posterior probabilities of <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> <b>height</b> proposed. The presented Bayesian network model shows the interrelationships among 37 causes affecting the <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> <b>height</b> and can calculate its posterior probabilities. The most important factors affecting falling were Non-compliance with safety instructions for work at height (0. 127), Lack of safety equipment for work at height (0. 094) and Lack of safety instructions for work at height (0. 071) respectively. Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian network used to determine how different causes could affect the <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> <b>height</b> at work.

40|$|To {{allow for}} an {{improved}} targeted approach to occupational injury research and prevention, detailed risk analyses of fatal, serious, and minor occupational injuries were completed {{with a focus}} on male <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> <b>heights</b> in construction. Reported lost-time injuries in Denmark (1993 to 1999) were analyzed for proportions, relative rates, and an injury severity odds ratio to assess relative hazards and reporting. Different types of injury risks, such as elevation falls through surfaces, were identified by contrasting fatal, serious and minor injuries. Trade-specific analyses provided evidence that the carpentry-trade group merits increased attention, as this group has excessively high proportions, rates and hazards for <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> <b>heights,</b> compared to the entire construction industry. Age-specific analyses of workers aged 20 to 59 revealed that the rates of serious-injury <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> <b>heights</b> increase with increasing age.

A focus on construction and <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> <b>heights</b> is necessary {{not only in terms of}} fatal injuries, but also for serious injuries.

40|$|AbstractTraumatic {{spinal cord}} injury (TSCI) is a {{condition}} with suffering of neural structures from acute trauma with short-term or permanent sensory and motor problems. This {{study was conducted with}} the aim of determining the prevalence of TSCI in Tehran with emphasis on demographic characteristics of patients and to evaluate the effect of computed tomography (CT) in determining fracture type and severity grade of injury among TSCI patients. In a cross-sectional study, all TSCI and spinal fracture patients (N= 520) who referred to the main trauma center in Tehran, Iran, in 2013 and 2014 were selected. Radiography and CT scan were prepared and reported blindedly by two radiologists. Majority of the patients was 21 – 30 years male, married and their most common occupation was car driver. A significant difference was observed between gender and etiology (P= 0. 001). The main etiology was traffic accident followed by <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> <b>height.</b> While the most common location of injury for males was thoracic vertebrae followed by lumbar vertebrae; for females it was lumbar followed by thoracic. Majority of patients had ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) impairment scale of E (normal), followed by B (sensory incomplete). Most of the cases were hospitalized less than one week. Age of the patient and duration of hospitalization had a significant association (P= 0. 015). The results showed that in traumatic spinal cord events, traffic accident and <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> <b>height</b> are the main etiologies; hence, authorities in Iranian health system could consider preventive policies to decline the load and TSCI effects in hospitals and population...|$|E

40|$|Car {{carriers}} are {{a type of}} semitrailer which exhibit {{occupational health and safety}} (OHS) concerns due to <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> <b>height</b> during operations. This article outlines research carried out on the car carrier sector to prevent hazard due to falls. A new design addresses OHS concerns of <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> <b>height.</b> The study details a survey of national data sources to examine fatalities caused due to <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> <b>height</b> in the car carrier sector. It also investigates OHS studies carried out by Work Safe Victoria (WSV) for the semitrailer sector. Injuries are often caused by drivers working above 1. 5 meters height for loading-unloading of cars, moving decks up and down, and strapping cars in. Slips and trips are two major contributors to <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> <b>heights.</b> The new car carrier design excels in reducing the risk of injuries to drivers and represents a new bench mark for OHS standards in the heavy vehicle sector. All decks of the new designs are operated by hydraulics and use a unique ratchet lock mechanism for loading at a safe working height (below 1. 5 meters). All cars are strapped on at a safe working height, and then the car decks operate hydraulically to transfer them to the required position. This also includes the car on prime mover, which shuttles across from one deck to another using hydraulic and rack-pinion mechanisms. The novel car carrier design avoids <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> height; the next step would be to transfer this technology to other similarly effected heavy vehicle sectors...|$|R
