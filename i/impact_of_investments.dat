5000|$|There {{has been}} wide {{uncertainty}} and debate {{as to what}} to call the inclusion of intangible factors relating to the sustainability and ethical <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments.</b> Names have ranged from the early use of buzz words such as [...] "green" [...] and [...] "eco", to the wide array of possible descriptions for the types of investment analysis - [...] "responsible investment", [...] "socially responsible investment" [...] (SRI), [...] "ethical", [...] "extra-financial", [...] "long horizon investment" [...] (LHI), [...] "enhanced business", [...] "corporate health", [...] "non-traditional", and others. But the predominance of the term ESG has now become fairly widely accepted. A survey of 350 global investment professionals conducted by AXA Investment Managers and AQ Research in 2008, led by Dr Raj Thamotheram, director of responsible investment at AXA, concluded that although both ESG and [...] "sustainable" [...] were the most commonly used names for the new data integrated into mainstream investment analysis, the vast majority of professionals preferred the term ESG to describe such data.|$|E
5000|$|CarbonCount is a metric {{developed}} by the Alliance to Save Energy that quantifies the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> in U.S.-based energy-efficiency and renewable-energy projects given the expected reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions resulting from each $1,000 of investment. In 2015, Bloomberg New Energy Finance honored CarbonCount with its Finance for Resilience (FiRE) award. [...] FiRE is an open and action-oriented platform that collects, develops and helps implement powerful ideas to accelerate finance for clean energy, climate, sustainability and green growth. FiRe singles out ideas that {{have the potential for}} incremental finance of at least $1bn in clean energy in {{the first three years of}} implementation, that are achievable within 1-3 years. Hannon Armstrong's 2015 issuance of Sustainable Yield Bonds secured by a portion of its utility scale solar and wind real estate related assets was the first investment to be certified under the CarbonCount methodology, receiving a CarbonCount score of 0.39 metric tons of CO2 offset per $1000 of investment.

5000|$|During {{his term}} as European Commissioner for Regional Policy (February 2010-November 2014) Johannes Hahn {{implemented}} {{the most ambitious}} and comprehensive reform of EU Regional Policy so far. The main achievement of the reform is the transformation of Regional Policy from a subvention- into a genuine investment policy, closely linked with EU economic governance and macro-economic conditions. This allows e.g. to modify programmes to support key structural reforms.The reform refocuses investments in the real economy and on priority areas which create sustainable jobs and foster growth such as the low carbon economy, support for small and medium enterprises, innovation & research, education and training. The introduction of clearly defined conditions {{as well as a}} better evaluation system make sure that the principle of [...] "better spending" [...] is actually safeguarded. Countries and regions will have to announce upfront what objectives they intend to achieve with the available resources and identify precisely how they will measure progress towards those goals. This will allow better monitoring and more focused investments.Based on the new regulation, European regions have developed so called smart specialisation strategies to identify their particular strengths and potentials as the basis for investments. The adoption of smart specialistion strategy was an ex-ante conditionality for the approval of regional programs for the period 2014-2020.Despite cuts in the overall EU budget, EU Commissioner Johannes Hahn succeeded to keep the high level of financial support for strategic investments in the new period (2014-2020): Funding for regional and cohesion policy in 2014-2020 amounts to 351,8 billion Euro. Taking into account the national contribution of member states, and the leverage effect of financial instruments, the overall <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> is likely to be about 600 billion Euro.Parts of the reform were already implemented {{in the last year of}} the Barroso term. Thanks to increased flexibility, allowing reprogramming of structural funds, the reformed Cohesion Policy paid also an important role in overcoming coping with the economic crisis. Measures in this context were e.g. reallocation of unused funds for education, training and employment as well as for providing urgently needed liquidity for enterprises [...]The reform, endorsed by the Council and European Parliament with overwhelming majority and strongly supported also by stakeholders and the Committee of the Regions, established Hahn's reputation as a [...] "forward looking, bold reformer".|$|E

However, efficiency and the learning period associated with investment spikes differ among plants across industries. The most pronounced <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> age on productivity growth (5. 3 % for meat products, 4 % for dairy products, and 2. 8 % in all food manufacturing plants) occurs during the fifth year of post-investment spike.

40|$|We {{develop a}} general {{equilibrium}} vintage capital model with embodied energy- saving technological progress and an explicit energy market {{to study the}} <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> subsidies on investment and output. Energy and capital {{are assumed to be}} complementary in the production process. New machines are less energy con- suming and scrapping is endogenous. It is shown that the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> subsidies heavily depends on the structure of the energy market, the mechanism explaining this outcome relying on the tight relationship between the lifetime of capital goods and energy prices via the scrapping conditions inherent to vintage models. In particular, under a free entry structure for the energy sector, invest- ment subsidies boost investment, while the opposite result emerges under natural monopoly if increasing returns in the energy sector are not strong enough.

The private <b>investment</b> rate <b>of</b> countries with better institutional quality is higher, and the productivity of any given level <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> is greater in countries with better institutions. Models that include various indicators of institutional quality along with inputs such as physical and human capital will generally underestimate the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> institutional quality on growth {{because they do not}} account for the indirect <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> institutions on <b>investment,</b> as is done here.

Further, future institutional improvements are more likely to occur against a background of poor economic performance than one of sustained growth.
