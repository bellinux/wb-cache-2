30|$|A {{comparison}} of the index of potential water storage (PWS) with the magnetic properties <b>of</b> <b>soils</b> in Russia and of Argentina and China paleosols suggests the existence {{of one or two}} climatic thresholds that affect the formation, preservation or <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> ferrimagnetic minerals. <b>Soils</b> characterized by a positive PWS are wetted during {{an important part of the}} year, creating an appropriate environment that favors the <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> ferrimagnetic minerals due to mainly reductive dissolution.

50|$|Soil {{acts as an}} {{engineering}} medium, a habitat for soil organisms, a recycling system for nutrients and organic wastes, a regulator of water quality, a modifier of atmospheric composition, and a medium for plant growth, making it a critically important provider of ecosystem services. Since soil has a tremendous range of available niches and habitats, it contains most of the Earth's genetic diversity. A gram of soil can contain billions of organisms, belonging to thousands of species, mostly microbial and in the main still unexplored. Soil has a mean prokaryotic density of roughly 108 organisms per gram, whereas the ocean has no more than 107 procaryotic organisms per milliliter (gram) of seawater. Organic carbon held in soil is eventually returned to the atmosphere {{through the process of}} respiration carried out by heterotrophic organisms, but a substantial part is retained in the soil in the form of soil organic matter; tillage usually increases the rate of respiration, leading to the <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> organic matter. Since plant roots need oxygen, ventilation is an important characteristic of soil. This ventilation can be accomplished via networks of interconnected soil pores, which also absorb and hold rainwater making it readily available for plant uptake. Since plants require a nearly continuous supply of water, but most regions receive sporadic rainfall, the water-holding capacity of soils is vital for plant survival.|$|E

5000|$|Agriculture {{is seen to}} be one of {{the main}} players in the <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> {{richness}} in human history. Certain agricultural practices can deplete soil of carbon, such as monoculture, failing to rotate crops sufficiently, and intensive livestock grazing. Soil that is low in carbon will not support plant life and is susceptible to desertification. Without plants, soil cannot hold water sufficiently, and will become dry and brittle over time. Agroecology is an overarching category of approaches to creating a more sustainable agricultural system and increase the health of soil. It includes [...] "permaculture", originally being a combination of the words [...] "permanent" [...] and [...] "agriculture", which is a systems thinking approach that can increase the carbon content of soil by using natural patterns in already existing ecosystems to promote a higher efficiency of food production, a lower need for human involvement, and a healthier ecosystem. Permaculture focuses on using the land and a strong knowledge of plants, animals and natural cycles to create ecosystems that yield plentiful produce and help keep themselves healthy and productive. This can be done through intentional landscaping that would utilize as much rainfall as possible or placing nitrogen fixing plants near another crop that might need them. Agroecology also includes the ideas of holistic management. This approach stems from the work of Allan Savory who claims that planned grazing can improve soil health and reverse the effects of desertification.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process of}} sedentarization is first {{thought to have}} {{occurred}} around 12,000 BCE in the Levant region of southwest Asia though other regions around the world soon followed. The emergence of civilization is generally associated with the Neolithic, or Agricultural Revolution, which occurred in various locations between 8,000 and 5,000 BCE, specifically in southwestern/southern Asia, northern/central Africa and Central America. At first, the Neolithic was associated with shifting subsistence cultivation, where continuous farming led to the <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> fertility resulting in the requirement to cultivate fields further and further removed from the settlement, eventually compelling the settlement itself to move. In major semi-arid river valleys, annual flooding renewed soil fertility every year, {{with the result that}} population densities could rise significantly. This encouraged a secondary products revolution in which people used domesticated animals not just for meat, but also for milk, wool, manure and pulling ploughs and carts—a development that spread through the Eurasian Oecumene.

Both the farm and animal productions are mainly used for familysubsistence and any extra production is taken to urban centers for sale to generate some cash to buy other essential goods and services.Irrigated-farms, on the other hand, support 2000 families in the region. Like rain-fed farming irrigated farming practices are for subsistence as well. Farmers grow fruits and vegetables for cash and grow tomatoes, lettuce, guava, oranges, papaya, lime, watermelons, melons (Shamam) pepper, carrot, onions etc. They take them to local urban centers and generate cash to buy food stuffsand other essential goods and services.
