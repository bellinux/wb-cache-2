The propellants were injected uniformly to ensure satisfactory combustion. The injector and oxidizer dome assembly was located at the top of the thrust chamber. The dome provided a manifold for the distribution of the LOX to the injector and served as a mount for the gimbal bearing and the augmented spark igniter.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent decades}} {{there has been}} a strong trend towards the use of lean {{premixed}} combustion in order to produce gas turbine systems that are compliant with air quality regulations. Additional growing interest in using alternative fuels has drawn many problems in terms of operational stability, thus there have been extensive investigations to achieve more stable and reliable combustion systems. Flame flashback {{has been one of the}} major instability problems that have the potential of causing considerable damage to the combustion system hardware in addition to significant increase of emissions such as CO and NOX. Swirl combustors are proven as effective flame stabilisers over wide range of operation conditions due to swirl structures which provide a low velocity region that enables flame anchoring. However the interaction between swirl structures and swirl burner geometries can considerably alter the stability regime downstream the burner exit plane. Using central injectors either as a central bluff body or to inject fuel diffusively have been used successfully to achieve wide stability limits and prevent upstream flame propagation. However, central injectors in swirl combustors can be subject to large amounts of heat, which can cause flashback, subsequently increasing maintenance cost and reducing the predicted operating life of the system. This paper present a series of experiments using a well-characterised tangential swirl burner to investigate the effect of using diffusive air injection on flow field characteristics and how it can affect the lower instability limits through altering the flashback mechanism by Combustion Induced Vortex Breakdown (CIVB). Results show that using diffusive air stream injection affects flashback trends significantly by providing a wider range of stability limits both in terms of equivalence ratio and mass flow rate which implies the possibility of working at higher power outputs compared to the case when using a central <b>body</b> <b>injector.</b> This technique can be considered a promising technology in terms of flexibility of operation because it enables switching to another air stream diameter while maintaining full load operation as opposed to the use of central <b>body</b> <b>injectors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} a group of Romanian injecting substance users “migrating” from heroin to novel psychoactive substances (NPS) as a counterpublic seeking to escape the stigma of drug abjection. Design/methodology/approach – The findings are drawn from interview and observational data collected mainly at drug services sites in Bucharest, Romania. Findings – The stimulant powders sold by head shops appealed to experienced drug users because they seemed to emulate a consumerist ethos and cultivate a healthy, rational agent that popular discourses of addiction deem incompatible with drug careers. NPS and head shops were thus initially understood as a possibility of escaping “junk identities”. However, they ultimately sealed <b>injectors</b> as abject <b>bodies</b> that obstructed the collaborative goals of rehabilitation and health restoration. A sense of symbolic distance shaped by notions of moral and bodily hygiene separated heroin and NPS users, as the latter increasingly came to be seen and see themselves as flawed consumers of health and freedom. Practical implications – NPS retail spaces could present valuable opportunities to insert harm-reduction resources and harness counterpublic health strategies. Social implications – Dominant definitions of substance use as unavoidable paths into self-destruction push users towards unknown compounds they can attach more fluid meanings to. This suggests that prohibitionist language still obscures rational dialogue about existing and emerging drugs.

40|$|The spray form {{development}} {{from a state}} of the art multi-hole injector for gasoline direct injection internal combustion engines is examined to attempt to determine the thermo-fluid dynamics affecting the spray development. The current state of knowledge regarding spray break-up and the interactivity of the factors on spray form are detailed. The spray under investigation was injected into purposely designed quiescent chambers to decouple the effects of the fluid mechanics on spray {{development from}} any in-engine effects. The pressure chambers, experimental apparatus and techniques used to characterise and measure the spray properties are described along with an assessment of any sources of variability in the measurement and analysis methodologies and hardware. Initial spray images of the spray produced by a range of multi-component “retail” fuels as well as single component non-oxygenated and oxygenated hydrocarbons with a range of boiling ranges and points for different <b>injector</b> <b>body</b> (and hence assumed fuel) temperatures and chamber gas pressures are presented. The experimental measurements show the strong interaction between the operational conditions in relation to the fuel properties and the physical spray form. A large amount of deviation from the nominal “ambient” spray form is observed for conditions where the fuel’s bubble point (boiling temperature at given gas pressure) is exceeded by a multiple of 10, termed spray collapse. The dependence of a multi-component fuel on the boiling characteristics of its highest volatility components suggest that it is these components which drive the fuel spray development formation, which is further illustrated by comparing different single component fluids. This suggests that higher volatility fluids are better representatives of full range, multi-component fuels for modelling or other investigative work when a single component fuel is required to be used. The onset of spray collapse was found to be gradual with no sudden “threshold” condition at which collapse occurred, also illustrated by a gradual reduction in measured spray droplet size with increasing <b>injector</b> <b>body</b> temperature and/or reducing gas pressure. The physical factors affecting spray development and break-up, and their effects are examined including the fluid flow inside a real size transparent, optically accessed nozzle, illustrating the effect of cavitation supplying nucleation sites for the subsequent vaporisation of the fuel. The scales of local air turbulence are found to affect the local vapour concentration, and hence vaporisation rate, and hence the interaction of these factors is shown to determine the spray formation...|$|E

Fuel injection systems for DISI engines undergo rapid developments in their design and performance, therefore, their spray breakup mechanisms in the physical conditions encountered in DISI engines over a range of operating conditions and injection strategies require continuous attention. In this context, there are sparse data {{in the literature on}} spray formation differences between conventionally drilled injectors by spark erosion and latest Laser-drilled injector nozzles.

40|$|Abstract. Fuel {{injector}} in automotive {{engine is}} a very important component in injecting the correct amount of fuel into the combustion chamber. The injection system need to be in a very safe and optimum condition during the engine operation. The mulfunction of the injection system can be avoided if the current working condition is known and a proper maintenence procedure is implemented. This paper proposes the development of a fuel injector monitoring method using strain signals captured by a single-channel strain gage attached on the fuel <b>injector</b> <b>body.</b> The fuel injector was operated under three main sets of parameters; pulse width (ms), frequency (Hz) and pressure (bar) which were varried from 5 ms to 15 ms, 17 Hz to 25 Hz and 10 bar to 70 bar respectively. The settings produce 27 different engine operations and the strain signal will be captured at each operation. The captured strain signals will be analyzed using I-kazTM Multilevel technique and will be correlated with the main parameters. The relationship between the I-kazTM Multilevel coefficient and the main parameters indicate good correlations which can be used as the guidance for fuel injector monitoring during actual operation. The I-kaz Multilevel technique was found to be very suitable in this study since it is capable of showing consistence pattern change at every parameter change during the engine operation. This monitoring system has a big potential to be developed and improved for the optimization of fuel injector system performance in the automotive industry...|$|E
40|$|Alinear optical {{displacement}} sensorwas {{designed to}} overcome the problems related to the sensitivity of traditional transducers to electromagnetic disturbance, when applied to the measurement of needle lift in electrically actuated Diesel fuel injectors. The sensor consisted of a laser light emitter, a receiver, and a device used for modulating {{the intensity of the}} light reaching the receiver in function of position of the moving element. Thus, two rectangular windows were mounted on the <b>injector</b> <b>body,</b> while a third window was rigidly connected to the needle control piston, and aligned with the fixed ones, to obtain a clearance area which varied linearly with needle position. An optical fibre cable was used to transfer the laser light from the source to one of the fixed window, while a similar cable was connected between the second window and the receiver. Hence, the intensity of the light reaching the receiver was proportional to the position of the injector needle. Light intensity was converted into an equivalent voltage, and this signal was fed to the data acquisition system. The injector needle lift curves were measured and compared with those obtained with a commercial eddy current sensor. The reliability of the sensor was further improved by designing a suitable gasket that prevented fuel oil from reaching the optical windows, thus avoiding the onset of fluid cavitation, which would have resulted in bubble formation and consequent random laser light scattering, hence measurement alteratio...|$|E
40|$|Liquid {{hydrocarbons}} {{are difficult}} to atomize electrostatically at practical flow rates due to their high resistivities and low concentration of charge carriers. However special “charge injection” techniques {{have been used in}} this investigation to produce combustible sprays of oils. An experimental investigation of the drop size and velocity distributions within a charged kerosine spray is presented, using a PDA system and photographic methods. Bimodal size distributions are found with a central core of larger drops or ligament formations near the nozzle surrounded by a sheath of smaller drops. Because of the bimodal character the concept of average diameter for the spray is difficult to apply so that there is little practical use defining a relationship between mean drop diameter and mean specific charge without a knowledge of a relationship between charge and size of individual drops. Examination of the velocity component distributions showed the processes which control the two-zone characteristics of the spray. The larger drops have a high inertia and were less deflected by the space charge force within the spray and it is argued that the larger drops possess a smaller specific charge compared with the smaller drops which reinforces the tendency for the large drops to remain along the spray centreline. For the smaller drops the converse is the case, to the extent that at low flow rates their trajectories have a negligible axial velocity component and recirculation toward the earthed <b>injector</b> <b>body</b> is observed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The fuel {{injector}} acts a double role: {{it is the}} valve of the pump supplying fuel to the combustion chamber and the device spraying a supplied dose. As the valve it may operate as a self-opening or self-closing valve, depending on the pressure produced by the fuel pump, or the valve controlled by external signals. Techniques and diagnosis methods for {{fuel injector}}s depend on a fuel injector’s control system and construction details. For practical reasons the fuel injector is a sectional valve with a separated component called atomizer. Atomizers must be cooled. It is possible to cool with fuel or with external water- or oil-cooling system. In case of liquid-cooled fuel injectors, apart from malfunctions causes known from literature, decrease of the cooling efficiency may appear, as {{the effect of the}} penetration of fuel from injector to the cooling system of injector.

40|$|In {{order to}} enable {{investigations}} of the fuel flow inside unmodified injectors, we have developed a new experimental approach to measure time-resolved vibration spectra of diesel nozzles using a three dimensional laser vibrometer. The technique we propose {{is based on the}} triangulation of the vibrometer and fuel pressure transducer signals, and enables the quantitative characterisation of quasi-cyclic internal flows without requiring modifications to the injector, the working fluid, or limiting the fuel injection pressure. The vibrometer, which uses the Doppler effect to measure the velocity of a vibrating object, was used to scan injector nozzle tips during the injection event. The data were processed using a discrete Fourier transform to provide time-resolved spectra for valve-closed-orifice, minisac and microsac nozzle geometries, and injection pressures ranging from 60 to 160 MPa, hence offering unprecedented insight into cyclic cavitation and internal mechanical dynamic processes. A peak was consistently found in the spectrograms between 6 and 7. 5 kHz for all nozzles and injection pressures. Further evidence of a similar spectral peak was obtained from the fuel pressure transducer and a needle lift sensor mounted into the <b>injector</b> <b>body.</b> Evidence of propagation of the nozzle oscillations to the liquid sprays was obtained by recording high-speed videos of the near-nozzle diesel jet, and computing the fast Fourier transform for a number of pixel locations at the interface of the jets. This 6 - 7. 5 kHz frequency peak is proposed to be the natural frequency for the injector's main internal fuel line. Other spectral peaks were found between 35 and 45 kHz for certain nozzle geometries, suggesting that these particular frequencies may be linked to nozzle dependent cavitation phenomena.

40|$|Part 1 of {{this paper}} {{presents}} the development and validation of a detailed dynamic model for the needle motion of a common hole‐type diesel fuel injector as used in a direct injection diesel engine. The injector needle motion {{is described as a}} two‐mass piece‐wise linear vibro‐impact system, unlike the conventional modelling techniques which use a single‐mass approach. The use of two masses permits analysis of both the needle impact behaviour and of the more general dynamics of the fuel injection process. Model parameters are derived from a combination of measurement and estimation, and the subsequent model is evaluated via direct measurement of the spring seat displacement. The opening and closing needle impact behaviour is shown to exhibit close correlation with key injection parameters, including fuel injection pressure, fuelling rate and timing. The model revealed that the impact of the needle when opening is found to exhibit lower amplitude but more high‐frequency components than the impact associated with the closing. The measurement of the <b>injector</b> <b>body</b> vibration response to these impacts is shown to enable non‐intrusive estimation of injection parameters, alleviating the problems associated with conventional intrusive needle‐lift measurement.

40|$|High-pressure {{multi-hole}} injectors for direct-injection spark-ignition engines {{offer some}} great benefits {{in terms of}} fuel atomisation, as well as flexibility in fuel targeting by selection of the number and angle of the nozzle’s holes. However, very few data exist for injector-body temperatures representative of engine operation with various fuels, especially at low-load conditions with early injection strategies that {{can also lead to}} phase change due to fuel flash boiling upon injection. The challenge is further complicated by the predicted fuel stocks which will include a significant bio-derived component presenting the requirement to manage fuel flexibility. The physical/chemical properties of bio-components, like various types of alcohols, can differ markedly from gasoline and it is important to study their effects in direct comparison to liquid hydrocarbons. This work outlines results from an optical investigation (high-speed imaging and droplet sizing) into the effects of fuel properties, temperature and pressure conditions on the extent of spray formation.

40|$|A single fuel {{injection}} pulse can be split into smaller pulses for optimizing the engine performance. In every injected pulse, the engine requires a specific quantity of fuel which is {{decided by the}} Engine Control Module (ECM). The quantity of fuel injected {{is critical to the}} performance of the engine. A technique to assess and compensate for fueling errors and variability in the injected fuel quantity estimation is of great interest. The current study is intended to identify the critical parameters that cause variability in the injected pulse quantity and devise suitable control strategies to control those parameters to enhance the accuracy of the fuel delivered in every shot during injection. The focus here is on the Cummins Inc. Heavy Duty XPI injector configured to run a small pilot and a large main pulse. The work involves using an injector model in the Gamma Technologies suite (GT Fuel). The model was validated for single pulse injection. ^ Since multiple pulse injection has timing issues very different from the single pulse injection, this work involves generating a new critical parameter tree for multiple pulse injection. From the Critical Parameter Flow Down, body pressure dynamics were identified as the primary cause of the variability in fueling. There is a pressure wave set up inside the <b>injector</b> <b>body</b> due to the first injection pulse. When the second pulse is fired, the pressure in the <b>injector</b> <b>body</b> is fluctuating. The condition at which the second pulse is fired depends upon the spacing between pulses and the quantity injected in the first pulse. Since body pressure is critical, a simple model to estimate the body pressure trace across an injection event has been developed. The simple model results are compared with the results from GT Fuel. Good agreement is found between the simple model results and the GT Fuel Model. ^ To pinpoint the focus of the fueling error, the injection rate shapes for the multipulse cases were analyzed in comparison with the single pulse case with matching conditions. The opening portion of the injection rate shape was identified as the major contributor to the fueling error. The start of the second pulse shifts owing to the preceding pulse and the opening slope of the rate shape changes as well. An approximation to quantify this error using rate shape parameters has been devised. This approximation captures about 70 % of the total fueling error. To use this approximation, the rate shape parameters need to be estimated. Since these parameters depend upon the system dynamics, correlation with the body pressure parameters was sought. Regression models were used to estimate the dominant rate shape parameters influencing fueling. The predictor variables in the regression models are the body pressure parameters. The opening slope is estimated within an error of 5 % while the shift in the start of injection is estimated within 15 %. Thus, the body pressure is initially estimated, and using the parameters of the body pressure in the regression equations, the rate shape parameters are estimated. This results in the estimation of the fueling error. ^ A simple technique to correct for the error in fueling is to alter the on-time of the injector. A scheme for correcting the on-time is also described. This scheme is specific for the injector and the information to correct for the on-time is obtained from the Fueling-On-time Curve drawn up for a particular injector. This estimation-correction scheme can reduce the fueling variation by about 40 % on average. ^ This thesis provides insight into the functioning and the underlying aspects of multipulse injection in solenoid operated diesel fuel injectors. A scheme to correct this error is described which is proposed to work satisfactorily in steady state engine operating conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} emission norms {{have been}} one of the major driving forces behind the research in diesel engines for more innovative combustion strategies, after-treatment techniques and fuel injection systems. Multiple pulse injection strategies have been investigated to be effective in providing a trade-off to limit the exhaust emissions, noise and fuel consumption. Though multiple injection strategies are advantageous, they are challenging to monitor and control. Multiple injections behave differently in terms of injection parameters such as start of injection (SOI) delay, hydraulic duration and needle velocity which eventually leads to fueling variation for the same rail pressure and commanded on-time values. Thus, estimation and control strategies for single pulse injection are insufficient for multiple injection cases. To compensate for the fueling variation, the first step is to identify or estimate the fueling variation for the given case of multipulse injection. ^ After the first pulse is injected, pressure waves are set up inside the <b>injector</b> <b>body.</b> This changes the initial conditions for the next injection. The current study focuses on the effect of these body pressure fluctuations to estimate the fueling variation in two-pulse cases. A hybrid modeling approach is followed to develop a simple model for the lower body of the injector to estimate the mass flow rate and fueling. The model is calibrated using an optimization technique to compute a set of coefficients defining the given injector configuration using a set of simulated single pulse injection cases. These coefficients are implemented to estimate the fueling and calculate the fueling variation (i. e. delta fueling) for the second pulse of a two-pulse case by using a simulated body pressure signal. The results of the technique are discussed for a number of rail pressure, commanded on-time and hydraulic separation values. ^ The injectors under study belong to the family of Cummins Scania XPI injectors. These are solenoid actuated, high pressure injectors. The work is sponsored by Cummins Fuel Systems, Columbus, Indiana. ...|$|E
40|$|Hydrodynamic {{turbulence}} and cavitation {{are known}} to {{play a significant role}} in high-pressure atomizers, but the small geometries and extreme operating conditions hinder the understanding of the flow's characteristics. Diesel internal flow experiments are generally conducted using x-ray techniques or on transparent, and often enlarged, nozzles with different orifice geometries and surface roughness to those found in production injectors. In order to enable investigations of the fuel flow inside unmodified injectors, we have developed a new experimental approach to measure time-resolved vibration spectra of diesel nozzles using a 3 D laser vibrometer. The technique we propose is based on the triangulation of the vibrometer and fuel pressure transducer signals, and enables the quantitative characterisation of quasi-cyclic internal flows without requiring modifications to the injector, the working fluid, or limiting the fuel injection pressure. The vibrometer, which uses the Doppler effect to measure the velocity of a vibrating object, was used to scan injector nozzle tips during the injection event. The data were processed using a discrete Fourier transform to provide time-resolved spectra for valve-closed-orifice, minisac and microsac nozzle geometries, and injection pressures ranging from 60 to 160 MPa, hence offering unprecedented insight into cyclic cavitation and internal mechanical dynamic processes. A peak was consistently found in the spectrograms between 6 and 7. 5 kHz for all nozzles and injection pressures. Further evidence of a similar spectral peak was obtained from the fuel pressure transducer and a needle lift sensor mounted into the <b>injector</b> <b>body.</b> Evidence of propagation of the nozzle oscillations to the liquid sprays was obtained by recording high-speed videos of the near-nozzle diesel jet, and computing the fast Fourier transform for a number of pixel locations at the interface of the jets. This 6 - 7. 5 kHz frequency peak is proposed to be the natural frequency for the injector's main internal fuel line. Other spectral peaks were found between 35 and 45 kHz for certain nozzle geometries, suggesting that these particular frequencies may be linked to nozzle dependent cavitation phenomena...|$|E
40|$|A {{triaxial}} injector is {{a single}} bi-propellant injection element located {{at the center of}} the <b>injector</b> <b>body.</b> The injector element consists of three nested, hydraulic swirl injectors. A small portion of the total fuel is injected through the central hydraulic injector, all of the oxidizer is injected through the middle concentric hydraulic swirl injector, and the balance of the fuel is injected through an outer concentric injection system. The configuration has been shown to provide good flame stabilization and the desired fuel-rich wall boundary condition. The injector design is well suited for preburner applications. Preburner injectors operate at extreme oxygen-to-fuel mass ratios, either very rich or very lean. The goal of a preburner is to create a uniform drive gas for the turbomachinery, while carefully controlling the temperature so as not to stress or damage turbine blades. The triaxial injector concept permits the lean propellant to be sandwiched between two layers of the rich propellant, while the hydraulic atomization characteristics of the swirl injectors promote interpropellant mixing and, ultimately, good combustion efficiency. This innovation is suited to a wide range of liquid oxidizer and liquid fuels, including hydrogen, methane, and kerosene. Prototype testing with the triaxial swirl injector demonstrated excellent injector and combustion chamber thermal compatibility and good combustion performance, both at levels far superior to a pintle injector. Initial testing with the prototype injector demonstrated over 96 -percent combustion efficiency. The design showed excellent high -frequency combustion stability characteristics with oxygen and kerosene propellants. Unlike the more conventional pintle injector, there is not a large bluff body that must be cooled. The absence of a protruding center body enhances the thermal durability of the triaxial swirl injector. The hydraulic atomization characteristics of the innovation allow the design to be rapidly scaled from small in-space applications [500 - 5, 000 lbf (2. 2 22. 2 kN) ] to large thrust engine applications [80, 000 lbf (356 kN) and beyond]. The triaxial injector is also less sensitive to eccentricities, manufacturing tolerances, and gap width of many traditional coaxial and pintle injector designs. The triaxial-injector injection orifice configuration provides for high injection stiffness. The low parts count and relatively large injector design features are amenable to low-cost production...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. © 2017 ASME. Previous work {{has shown that}} {{compressible}} unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations, with suitable acoustic boundary conditions, are capable of correctly predicting the acoustic impedance of simplified fuel injectors. In this work the method developed is applied to simulating the acoustically forced flow in and downstream of a realistic multi-passage fuel injector. The simulations are validated by compar-ing the impedance of the injector with data obtained experimen-tally by a multi-microphone technique. Such results can then be {{used in conjunction with}} a suitable low-order thermo-Acoustic network model to predict the stability of combustors. However the validated simulations {{can also be used to}} reveal further de-tails about the effect of acoustic forcing on the flow field. The velocity flow field produced by the injector with and without acoustic forcing is analysed using snapshot POD to de-termine the large scale energy containing structures within the flow. In the non-Acoustically forced simulations it was found that the first four POD modes correspond to two rotating spi-ral modes, designated as the m= 1 and m= 2 modes with a peak frequency content of 450 Hz for the first mode and 1000 Hz for the second mode corresponding to experimental Hot-Wire mea-surements made in a separate study. It is hypothesised that these spiral modes will affect the atomisation, evaporation and mixing of the fuel in subsequent planned two-phase simulations. POD analysis of the flow subjected to 300 Hz, 300 Pa acoustic excita-tion shows that the first four POD modes correspond to similarly shaped spiral modes. The acoustic excitation is responsible for the appearance of 4 POD modes within the <b>injector</b> <b>body</b> that correspond to two push-pull velocity modes with axes of symme-try perpendicular to each other. The acoustic forcing also pro-duces two additional POD modes that most likely represent the non-linear interaction between the push-pull and spiral modes. Further analysis of the fluctuations in pressure, mass flow rate, angular velocity and swirl number, within the passages and at the injector exit plane, show that the fluctuations in pressure and mass flow rate average across the passages while variations in angular velocity and swirl number sum across the passages. The relationship between mass flow rate, angular velocity and swirl number is discussed with reference to general observations of the sensitivity of flames to fluctuations in these quantities...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{definition}} of an accurate mathematical model of a production common-rail-type injector for automotive diesel engines. The mathematical model defined in a previous work was refined, accounting for {{a broader range of}} effects on injector performance, thus allowing a more strict validation of the model predictions against experimental data. The geometry of the control-valve holes, crucial in determining the actual discharge coefficient, was accurately evaluated by means of silicone molds. The moving mechanical components of the injector, such as control valve, needle, and pressure rod were modeled using the mass-spring-damper scheme. The axial deformation under pressure of needle, pressure rod, nozzle and <b>injector</b> <b>body</b> was modeled. This effect was found to also affect the control valve device operation, and was properly accounted for. The model obtained was implemented in Simulink; the ordinary differential equations were solved by means of the numerical differentiation formulas implicit scheme of second-order accuracy, while the partial differential equations were integrated using the finite-difference Lax-Friedrichs method. In order to obtain sufficient data for validating the model in its entire operation field, two separate sets of tests were carried out. In the first analysis, a constant reference pressure was imposed in the rail, and the injector energizing time was progressively increased from values relative to small pilot injections to values characteristic of large main injections. The injected volume per stroke was measured by means of a mean delivery meter (EMI) device. During the second set of tests, the injector was mounted on a flow rate meter (EVI) device so as to measure the injection law. Electric current flowing through the injector solenoid, oil pressure in the common rail, and at the injector inlet, needle, and control valve lift were also gauged and recorded. The good agreement between numerical and experimental results allowed the use of the model to gain greater insight into the mechanisms and phenomena that regulate injector behavior. The nozzle hole discharge coefficient dependence upon time and needle lift was discussed, and the trends were presented in several working conditions. The flow in the control volume holes was studied, in order to determine whether cavitation occurs or not, giving an answer to a long disputed topic. Finally, the effects of injector deformation caused by fuel pressure on performance were investigate...|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} of the work {{reported}} here is {{in the design of}} an intelligent condition monitoring system for diesel engines. Mechanical systems in general and diesel engines in particular can develop faults if operated for any length of time. Condition monitoring is a method by which the performance of a diesel engine can be maintained at a high level, ensuring both continuous availability and design-level efficiency. A key element in a condition monitoring program is to acquire sensor information from the engine, and use this information to assess the condition of the engine, with an emphasis on monitoring causes of engine failure or reduced efficiency. A Ford 70 PS 4 -stroke diesel engine has been instrumented with a range of sensors and interfaced to a PC in order to facilitate computer controlled data acquisition and data storage. Data was analyzed to evaluate the optimum use of sensors to identify faults and to develop an intelligent algorithm for the engine condition monitoring and fault detection, and in particular faults affecting the combustion process in the engine. In order to investigate the fault-symptom relationships, two synthetic faults were introduced to the engine. Fuel and inlet air shortage were selected as the faults for their direct relationship to the combustion process quality. As a subtask the manually operated hydraulic brake was adapted to allow automatic control to improve its performance. Two modes of controlling were designed for the developed automatic control of the hydraulic brake system. A robust mathematical diesel engine model has been developed which can be used to predict the engine parameters related to the combustion process in the diesel engine, was constructed from the basic relationships of the diesel engine using the minimum number of empirical equations. The system equations of a single cylinder engine were initially developed, from which the multi-cylinder diesel engine model was validated against experimental test data. The model was then tuned to improve the predicted engine parameters for better matching with the available engine type. The final four-cylinder diesel engine model was verified and the results show an accurate match with the experimental results. Neural networks and fuzzification were used to develop and validate the intelligent condition monitoring and fault diagnosis algorithm, in order to satisfy the requirements of on-line operation, i. e. reliability, easily trained, minimum hardware and software requirements. The development process used a number of different neural network architecture and training techniques. To increase the number of the parameters used for the engine condition evaluation, the Multi-Net technique was used to satisfy accurate and fast decision making. Two neural networks are designed to operate in parallel to accommodate the different sampling rate of the key parameters without interference and with reduced data processing time. The two neural networks were trained and validated using part of the measured data set that represents the engine operating range. Another set of data, not utilized within the training stage, has been applied for validation. The results of validation process indicate the successful prediction of the faults using the key measured parameters, as well as a fast data processing algorithm. One of the main outcomes of this study is {{the development of a new}} technique to measure cylinder pressure and fuel pressure through the measurement of the strain in the <b>injector</b> <b>body.</b> The main advantage of this technique is that, it does not require any intrusive modification to the engine which might affect the engine actual performance. The developed sensor was tested and used to measure the cylinder and fuel pressure to verify the fuel fault effect on the combustion process quality. Due to high sampling rate required, the developed condition monitoring and fault diagnosis algorithm does not utilize this signal to reduce the required computational resources for practical applications.
