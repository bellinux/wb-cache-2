5000|$|The cobweb-like, fragile partial veil of some mushrooms, {{especially}} those in the genus Cortinarius, are known as cortinas. The <b>fibrous</b> <b>threads</b> of the cortina often catch the brown spores as they drop, making them visible as fine brown streaks along the stem. Some species of Agaricus, such as Agaricus arvensis, have a partial veil that resembles a cogwheel. Mycologists Alexander H. Smith and Harry D. Thiers, in their 1964 monograph on the bolete genus Suillus, proposed the term [...] "false veil" [...] to account for those species of Suillus that have a [...] "conspicuous cottony roll" [...] of tissue that originates from the cap margin (especially in young specimens) and never becomes integrated with the stem tissue.|$|E
50|$|Mammary glands develop during {{different}} growth cycles. They {{exist in}} both sexes during embryonic stage, forming only a rudimentary duct tree at birth. In this stage, mammary gland development depends on systemic (and maternal) hormones, {{but is also}} under the (local) regulation of paracrine communication between neighboring epithelial and mesenchymal cells by parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP). This locally secreted factor {{gives rise to a}} series of outside-in and inside-out positive feedback between these two types of cells, so that mammary bud epithelial cells can proliferate and sprout down into the mesenchymal layer until they reach the fat pad to begin the first round of branching. At the same time, the embryonic mesenchymal cells around the epithelial bud receive secreting factors activated by PTHrP, such as BMP4. These mesenchymal cells can transform into a dense, mammary-specific mesenchyme, which later develop into connective tissue with <b>fibrous</b> <b>threads,</b> forming blood vessels and the lymph system. A basement membrane, mainly containing laminin and collagen, formed afterward by differentiated myoepithelial cells, keeps the polarity of this primary duct tree. These components of the extracellular matrix are strong determinants of duct morphogenesis.|$|E
50|$|Histology shows {{a change}} in the prickle cell layer, and this is {{responsible}} for the laying down of condensed keratin causing the groove. The junctional tissue is reduced to a slender <b>fibrous</b> <b>thread,</b> almost avascular, and all the tissues beyond the constricting band is repressed by a fibro-fatty mass covered by hyperkeratotic integument.|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of a novel silk production system in a marine amphipod provides insights into the wider potential of natural silks. The tube-building corophioid amphipod Crassicorophium bonellii produces from its legs <b>fibrous,</b> adhesive underwater <b>threads</b> that combine barnacle cement biology with aspects of spider silk thread extrusion spinning. We characterised the filamentous silk as a mixture of mucopolysaccharides and protein deriving from glands representing two distinct types. The carbohydrate and protein silk secretion is dominated by complex β-sheet structures and a high content of charged amino acid residues. The filamentous secretion product exits the gland through a pore near {{the tip of the}} secretory leg after having moved through a duct, which subdivides into several small ductules all terminating in a spindle-shaped chamber. This chamber communicates with the exterior and may be considered the silk reservoir and processing/mixing space, in which the silk is mechanically and potentially chemically altered and becomes fibrous. We assert that further study of this probably independently evolved, marine arthropod silk processing and secretion system can provide not only important insights into the more complex arachnid and insect silks but also into crustacean adhesion cements...|$|R
40|$|From the {{analysis}} of the basophilic organella in fixed cells, using the polarizing microscope the author concluded that the ground structure of the organella should be composed of fibrous proteins attached with lipid molecules perpendicular to their long axes. But there is a problem left to be clarified whether or not {{the analysis}} on molecular arrangement by polarizing microscope on fixed cells gives the picutre of moleclar structure on each basophilic organella in living cells. Then the morphologic picture of fibrous coagulants caused by the fixative used in the former experiment was observed under the electron microscope. The coagulated fibrous basophilia showed to be composed of the electron dense globules and the electron sparse fibrous elements arranged alternatively, though each of them differed from others in the thickness and length. The size of globules was 100 to 300 mμ in diameter and they looked like a pearl necklace or an elongated rosary stringed with a <b>thread.</b> The <b>fibrous</b> parts <b>threading</b> the globules showed a marked difference in both thickness and length, i. e. in some parts the globules appeared to be contacted closely, or in other parts they were <b>threaded</b> with elongated <b>fibrous</b> parts of 50 to 400 mμ in length. The precise observation revealed that some thick necklace-like structures were constructed by the parallel arrangement smaller units contacting with their corresponding parts. Their size was almost the same with the vesicular structures in the cultured cells fixed with osmium vapor appeared in the report of Poter, i. e. endoplasmic reticulum of them seen on fibroblasts or on nerve cells demonstrated by Palay. Observations on the fixed exocrine cells of pancreas, which have the doubly layered thread-like endoplasmic reticulum, revealed not rosary-like elements but a thick fibrous structure which had almost the same thickness with that of endoplasmic reticulum as revealed on the cells fixed with osmium, and yet some of them showed a distinet double layer. Thus it was confirmed that the analytical results obtained from the observations on the fixed cells by the polarizing microscope should give the picture of molecular arrangement of endoplasmic reticulum of living cells...|$|R
40|$|Study of {{the brain}} of dinosaurs and other extinct animals entails great difficulties, because the brain, like many {{internal}} organs and soft tissues, suffers rapid decay after the animal's death. At best, the investigator may come across natural casts {{of the brain}} (Tertiary and Quaternary mammals) or plaster casts (reptiles). The work of Marsh (1886), Edinger (1929), Orlov (1947, 1961) and Gabuniya (1959), however, show that study of the volume {{and shape of the}} brain and the dimensions of the nerves running from it based on cast and plaster molds are of great interest for an understanding of the evolution of many forms. Nevertheless as Orlov (1961) rightly notes, we must approach the study of plaster moulds with great care, since the cast may not always correspond with the size and relief to the brain itself. In many reptiles the brain is often separated from the cranial bones by considerable expansions of the cerebral membranes and vascular plexuses and also by large cavities for the blood reservoirs (cranial sinuses), and the brain as it were "floats " suspended on fine, <b>fibrous</b> <b>threads</b> inside the tough cerebral membrane, the dura mater. Dendy (1911), studying the Sphenodon brain established, for example, that the brain occupied by no means the whole of the cranial cavity which corresponds to the volume of the dura mater. The latter is almost twice that of the brain itself. Such a ratio betwee...|$|E
