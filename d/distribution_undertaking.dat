Account stacking, which consists of having receivers on one account located in different locations, is contrary to the Bell TV Residential and Commercial Agreements. It is certainly not illegal, and in a worst-case scenario, service will be cancelled. This practice is detailed in CRTC Public Notice 2006-133 and 2006-134. There is no requirement whatsoever in the Regulations that prohibits a BDU (broadcast <b>distribution</b> <b>undertaking)</b> from providing service at more than one location via a single account.

Instead, conceptual art is redefined as the crystallisation and institutionalisation of an already relatively generalised Modernism, yet one whose material conditions must be contextualised within the economic and socio-political 'internationalism' {{of the end of the}} post-war era.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a pseudo {{three dimensional analysis}} to predict the indentation rolling resistance of belt conveyors. Conventional methods used to analyse the indentation rolling resistance problem typically assume a bottom cover of uniform thickness bonded to a rigid substrate with no consideration of the carcass properties. This work aims to analyse {{the influence of the}} carcass construction and configuration for steel cord conveyor belts and predict the influence on the indentation rolling resistance. Due to the presence of steel cords embedded in the conveyor belt, the pressure distribution at the interface between the belt and a conveyor idler roll is not uniform. To solve this problem, a static three dimensional finite element model was developed to determine the pressure distribution and reaction forces transmitted through the belt to the conveyor idler roll. The reaction loads are then used in a two dimensional viscoelastic finite element model to determine the indentation rolling resistance for the steel cord belt. This paper investigates the influence of the conveyor belt carcass and bottom cover properties on the resulting stress distribution throughout the belt and consequently on the indentation rolling resistance. The influence of the steel cord diameter and pitch, applied load, bottom cover thickness and strain rate is investigated. A finite element method is detailed for the analysis of the stress distribution throughout the belt. A range of carcass configurations is investigated and experimental verification of the calculated stress <b>distribution</b> <b>undertaken</b> using a Tekscan™ pressure measurement system...|$|R
40|$|Polychaete meroplanktonic larvae {{from the}} List tidal basin were identified, their {{horizontal}} and vertical distribution patterns described, and temporal abundance fluctuations analyzed. Tides cause marked changes in the depth of this basin, while seasonality and weather dependence cause high environmental and biological variability. The taxonomic composition was analyzed from samplings undertaken between 1996 - 2002, during flood and ebb periods. Spionid, phyllodocid, and polynoid larvae are representative for this basin, accounting 60 % {{of the total number}} of taxa (46 taxa). The larval production is numerically dominated by Pygospio elegans, Spio martinensis, Polydora cornuta and Lanice conchilega. Since their benthic stages are well known inside the basin, a large proportion of the larval production can be considered local. The low correspondence between benthic and planktonic assemblages suggested a qualitatively important input of long-distance larval vagrants. Sites within the basin differed in species composition, suggesting that larvae are not randomly mixed by the tidal hydrodynamics. Polychaete larvae are retained inside the basin, in spite of the continuous exchange of water with the North Sea. Analyses of the spatial <b>distribution</b> <b>undertaken</b> at three spatial scales during flood and ebb periods indicated that benthic occurrence, coastal morphology, and larval behavior could enhance species-specific distribution patterns. Significant fluctuations in total and partial larval abundances occurred between 1996 - 2001 were probably related to variables with influence over gonadal maturation and spawning in adult stages, as well as larval feeding and performances...|$|R

The high marginal rates imply that revenue and inequality neutral flat reforms are not feasible in most countries, however, there might be scope for non-revenue or non-inequality neutral reforms depending on political preferences...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{literature has}} a rich characterization of scoring rules for eliciting the subjective beliefs {{that an individual}} has for continuous events, but under the restrictive assumption of risk neutrality.

Alternatively, one must carefully calibrate inferences about true subjective probabilities from elicited subjective probabilities over binary events, recognizing the incentives that risk averse agents have to report the same probability for the two outcomes and reduce the variability of payoffs from the scoring rule. We characterize the comparable implications of the general case of a risk averse agent when facing a popular scoring rule over continuous events, and find that these concerns do not apply with anything like the same force. For empirically plausible levels of risk aversion, one can reliably elicit most important features of the latent subjective belief <b>distribution</b> without <b>undertaking</b> calibration for risk attitudes...|$|R
