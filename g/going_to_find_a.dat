In the midst of recording it, she also collaborated with recording artists Robbie Williams, Martina McBride and Trisha Yearwood in their respective albums Swings Both Ways (2013), Everlasting (2014) and [...] (2014). In an interview with Billboard magazine, she announced intentions to release a set of pop and country records, {{as well as a}} potential Broadway album, as a follow-up to Wrapped in Red. RCA Records chief executive Peter Edge also revealed in their 2014 mid-year assessment that they were in a process of finding new music and directions for some of their established acts — primarily with Clarkson. Early stages of development for a follow-up studio album began as early as June 2012, with Clarkson commissioning Rodney Jerkins in recording a potential track. She remarked: [...] "We're already working. I'm constantly like that because you never know when you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> song and so we're always working on the next thing."

Grodner later confirmed that the cast of Big Brother 10 would feature no pre-existing relationships, making it the first season since Big Brother 3 to do so. Grodner later stated [...] "Big Brother 9 involved couples, singles, and soul mates who were young, single, impulsive, and ready to party. We do a 180 with Big Brother 10.

60|$|That autumn he {{left the}} beach {{as soon as he}} could, and set off alone because of a notion in his bullet-head.

He met with more adventures than can be told, and narrowly escaped being caught by the Basking Shark, and the Spotted Shark, and the Hammerhead, and he met all the untrustworthy ruffians that loaf up and down the seas, and the heavy polite fish, and the scarlet spotted scallops that are moored in one place for hundreds of years, and grow very proud of it; but he never met Sea Cow, and he never found an island that he could fancy.|$|E

60|$|These {{factors have}} already reduced Germany's annual surplus {{to less than}} the $500,000,000 at which we arrived on other grounds as the maximum of her annual payments. But even if the {{rejoinder}} be made, {{that we have not}} yet allowed for the lowering of the standard of life and comfort in Germany which may reasonably be imposed on a defeated enemy,[133] there is still a fundamental fallacy in the method of calculation. An annual surplus available for home investment can only be converted into a surplus available for export abroad by a radical change in the kind of work performed. Labor, while it may be available and efficient for domestic services in Germany, may yet be able to find no outlet in foreign trade. We are back on the same question which faced us in our examination of the export trade--in what export trade is German labor <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> greatly increased outlet? Labor can only he diverted into new channels with loss of efficiency, and a large expenditure of capital. The annual surplus which German labor can produce for capital improvements at home is no measure, either theoretically or practically, of the annual tribute which she can pay abroad.|$|E
