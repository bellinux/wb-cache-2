5|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} the adoption of biological pest control measures is growers sticking to the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides have a variety of undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by <b>doing,</b> <b>for</b> example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|E
5|$|Brazil's {{involvement}} in the Uruguayan civil war also began to deepen. Luis Alves de Lima e Silva, the Count of Caxias, assumed the presidency (governorship) of Rio Grande do Sul and the command of the four Brazilian Army divisions headquartered in the province. Beginning in 1849, the Imperial government directly assisted the besieged Uruguayan government of Colorados in Montevideo, and on 6 September 1850 the Uruguayan representative Andres Lamas {{signed an agreement with}} Irineu Evangelista de Sousa to transfer money to the Montevideo government through his bank. On 16 March 1851, the Empire of Brazil openly declared its support of Colorado government of Uruguay against Oribe, something it had been covertly <b>doing</b> <b>for</b> more than two years. This did not please the Argentine government, and it began mobilizing for war.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} any {{acknowledgement}} of the mutual existence between the scriptores, only Flavius Vopiscus (ostensibly writing in 305 or 306) refers {{to any of the}} other authors (specifically Trebellius Pollio, Julius Capitolinus and Aelius Lampridius). None of the other five demonstrate any awareness of the existence of any of their 'colleagues'. However, these references cause difficulties when these authors also address Constantine in their dedications, as Vopiscus was also <b>doing.</b> <b>For</b> instance, Capitolinus mostly addresses Diocletian, but in the Albinus, Maximini and Gordiani he addresses Constantine in a fashion that suggests he is writing after 306.|$|E

5|$|Like John Filson, Timothy Flint also interviewed Boone, and his Biographical Memoir of Daniel Boone, the First Settler of Kentucky (1833) {{became one}} of the best-selling biographies of the 19th century. Flint greatly embellished Boone's adventures, <b>doing</b> <b>for</b> Boone what Parson Weems did for George Washington. In Flint's book, Boone fought hand-to-paw with a bear, escaped from Indians by {{swinging}} on vines (as Tarzan would later do), and so on. Although Boone's family thought the book was absurd, Flint greatly influenced the popular conception of Boone, since these tall tales were recycled in countless dime novels and books aimed at young boys.|$|E

On the other hand, her preference for French designers and her spending on her wardrobe brought her negative press. In order to downplay her wealthy background, Jacqueline stressed the amount of work she was <b>doing</b> <b>for</b> the campaign and declined to publicly discuss her clothing choices.|$|E

25|$|The Oilers {{struggled}} with their small-market status for several years, {{but after the}} wiped-out 2004–05 season, they were aided by a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between the NHL owners and players. This included a league-wide salary cap that essentially forced all teams to conform to a budget, as the Oilers had been <b>doing</b> <b>for</b> years. A more reasonable conversion rate of Canadian dollar revenues to US dollar payroll {{in the new millennium}} also helped the Oilers to return to profitability. Because of this, Edmonton was able to acquire Chris Pronger (former winner of the Hart and Norris Trophies) and Michael Peca (two-time Frank J. Selke Trophy winner) before the 2005–06 season.|$|E
25|$|Riot grrrl is an {{underground}} feminist punk movement that {{originated in the}} early 1990s in Washington state (particularly Olympia) and the greater Pacific Northwest. It also had origins in Washington, D.C. It is a subcultural movement that combines feminist consciousness and punk style and politics. It {{is often associated with}} third-wave feminism, which is sometimes seen as its starting point. It has also been described as a musical genre that came out of indie rock, with the punk scene serving as an inspiration for a musical movement in which women could express themselves in the same way men had been <b>doing</b> <b>for</b> the past several years.|$|E

25|$|Like {{many others}} who devoted their life to {{commercial}} art {{in the first half}} of the 20th century, Denis McLoughlin was never paid a great deal for his work. Many pieces of his artwork, the Boardman book covers in particular, which Denis had been promised would be returned to him, were either lost or ended up in private collections. While he made a living, Denis never accumulated much money. Although he had a pension from the British government, he was forced to augment his income by working long past retirement age. He once commented that he never particularly liked illustrating military topics and yet that is what he found himself <b>doing</b> <b>for</b> the last 20 years of his life. Perhaps, had he been given cowboy stories to illustrate, he might have been happier.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, {{the young}} and ambitious Kaiser Wilhelm II became emperor. He could not abide advice, least of all from the most {{experienced}} politician and diplomat in Europe, so he fired Bismarck. The Kaiser opposed Bismarck's careful foreign policy and wanted Germany to pursue colonialist policies, as Britain and France had been <b>doing</b> <b>for</b> decades, as well as build a navy that could match the British. The Kaiser promoted active colonization of Africa and Asia for those areas that were not already colonies of other European powers; his record was notoriously brutal {{and set the stage}} for genocide. The Kaiser took a mostly unilateral approach in Europe with as main ally the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and an arms race with Britain, which eventually led to the situation in which the assassination of the Austrian-Hungarian crown prince could spark off World War I.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Buffy the Vampire Slayer drew a large {{mainstream}} audience into fandom; greater demand allowed (even obliged, {{for the sake}} of time management) Buffy actors to charge much higher appearance fees than the Star Trek actors had. This pushed appearances {{out of the reach of}} some volunteer non-profit fan groups towards commercial event promoters. At the same time, a market for celebrity autographs emerged on eBay, which created a new source of income for actors, who began to charge money for autographs that they had previously been <b>doing</b> <b>for</b> free. This became significant enough that lesser-known actors would come to conventions without requesting any appearance fee, simply to be allowed to sell their own autographs (commonly on publicity photos). Today most events with actor appearances are organized by commercial promoters, though a number of fan-run conventions still exist, such as Toronto Trek and Shore Leave.|$|E

25|$|Many parents {{opposed to}} {{providing}} the HPV vaccine to their pre-teens agree the vaccine {{is safe and}} effective, but find talking to their children about sex uncomfortable. Dr. Elizabeth Lange, of Waterman Pediatrics in Providence, RI, addresses this concern by emphasizing what the vaccine is <b>doing</b> <b>for</b> the child. Dr. Lange suggests parents {{should focus on the}} cancer prevention aspect without being distracted by words like 'sexually transmitted'. Everyone wants cancer prevention, yet here parents are denying their children a form of protection {{due to the nature of}} the cancer—Lagne suggests that this much controversy would not surround a breast cancer or colon cancer vaccine. The HPV vaccine is suggested for 11-year-olds because it should be administered before possible exposure to HPV, yes, but also because the immune system has the highest response for creating antibodies around this age. Dr. Lange also emphasized the studies showing that the HPV vaccine does not cause children to be more promiscuous than they would be without the vaccine.|$|E
25|$|In 1638, after King Charles I had {{attempted}} to impose an Episcopalian version of the Book of Common Prayer upon the reluctant Scots, resistance spread throughout the country, eventually culminating in the Bishops' Wars. Montrose joined the party of resistance, and was for some time {{one of its most}} energetic champions. He had nothing puritanical in his nature, but he shared in the ill-feeling aroused by the political authority King Charles had given to the bishops. He signed the National Covenant, and was sent to suppress the opposition which arose around Aberdeen and in the country of the Gordons. Three times Montrose entered Aberdeen, where he succeeded in his object, on the second occasion carrying off the head of the Gordons, the Marquess of Huntly, as a prisoner to Edinburgh (though in so <b>doing,</b> <b>for</b> the first and last time in his life, he violated a safe-conduct). He was a leader of the delegation who subsequently met at Muchalls Castle to parley regarding the 1638 confrontation with the Bishop of Aberdeen. With the Earl Marischal he led a force of 9000 men across the Causey Mounth through the Portlethen Moss to attack Royalists at the Bridge of Dee. These events played a part in Charles I's decision to grant major concessions to the Covenanters.|$|E

In the story mode, her ship is found by Black Adam on Earth and initially join the other Regime remnants to help her cousin Superman escape {{in order to get}} help in stopping Brainiac's invasion. Until after Batman initially released Superman and his other imprisoned Regime members during Brainiac's invasion, she found out what the Regime had been <b>doing</b> <b>for</b> 5 years and was appalled by her cousin's actions. As of the final chapters against Brainiac when Superman and Batman's conflict about to start again over Brainiac to save entire planets and cities Brainiac took, she sided with Batman to save her cousin from his tyrannical self. In Batman's ending after he wins , she is offered a place in the Justice League for her efforts in stopping the invasion, In Superman's ending if he wins she is locked up by her cousin and is forcefully requested to join the Regime to which she refuses and Superman then shows a mind-controlled Batman under his service, horrifying her. In her single player ending, she spots Krypton among Brainiac's collection of stolen worlds, and hoped to find a safe way of freeing her home. As she grows closer to reversing Brainiac's collection, she hopes to find the right star system and save Argo City and Kandor, though she regrets failing to save Superman.|$|E
