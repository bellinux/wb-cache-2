5|$|A ring Roxy {{inherited}} from Archie, which went missing at Christmas, is planted in Janine's flat. Marsden receives an anonymous tip-off and Janine is arrested after the ring {{is found in}} her teapot. She is interviewed, but is released {{due to lack of}} evidence. She realises that Peggy planted the ring in an attempt to frame her. When Shirley thinks Phil is seeing another woman, she accuses him of only being interested in her for her alibi. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not true, but she drunkenly threatens to withdraw the alibi, and walks to the police station.|$|E
5|$|Marge is irritated when Homer's snoring (so loud, it can {{be heard}} {{throughout}} most of the city) keeps her up at night. She sees Dr. Hibbert about the problem, and asks about a surgery, but <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> expensive and tells them to get out when Homer asks him to do it for free. Developing a sleep problem, she sleeps for a night with Patty and Selma, and hears on the news that her old boyfriend, Artie Ziff, is one of America's five richest people. She drunkenly dictates an e-mail to Artie to congratulate him on his appearance, but Patty and Selma doctor it to use sexual terms in an attempt to split up Marge and Homer, much to Marge's horror (for using the word sex on the Internet). Artie, who over the years seems to have developed a rather frightening obsession with Marge (his house is decorated with a large number of 'Marge' sculptures/paintings), flies in his helicopter to the Simpson house to see Marge.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to skeptical explanations, Bruce Maccabee says a meteor theory would require impossibly slow speeds and durations for brightly glowing meteors on a horizontal trajectory. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{impossible for a}} bird to be as bright as reported by Arnold, and that birds—which could not fly as fast as Arnold's plane—would have steadily moved backward, not forwards, relative to his position.|$|E

25|$|As in The Age of Intelligent Machines Kurzweil argues {{here that}} {{evolution}} has an intelligence quotient just slightly greater than zero. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not {{higher than that}} because evolution operates so slowly, and intelligence {{is a function of}} time. Kurzweil explains that humans are far more intelligent than evolution, based on what we have created in the last few thousand years, and that in turn our creations will soon be more intelligent than us. The law of accelerating returns predicts this will happen within decades, Kurzweil reveals.|$|E
25|$|According to Weir, {{the main}} {{organiser}} of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings was Billy Hanna, a UDR sergeant and UVF 'brigadier'. He claimed that Hanna, Robin Jackson, Davy Payne and William Marchant {{carried out the}} Dublin bombings, while Stewart Young and brothers John and Wesley Somerville (both UDR soldiers) carried out the Monaghan bombing. He claimed the explosives had been provided by Captain John Irwin, a UDR Intelligence Officer, and that the bombs had been assembled at the Glenanne farm of James Mitchell, with help from fellow RUC officer Laurence McClure. Weir claims British Army Intelligence and the RUC knew who the culprits were but did not arrest them. Furthermore, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> likely that Army Intelligence/RUC knew about the bombings beforehand, due to its contacts with the Glenanne group.|$|E
500|$|Sejanus {{remained}} powerful {{until his}} sudden downfall and summary execution in October 31, the exact reasons for which remain unclear. On 26 October 31, just eight {{days after his}} death, his wife Apicata committed suicide. According to Cassius Dio, she left a message for the emperor: his son had been murdered by his wife Livilla and her lover, Sejanus. The story should be read with caution. Levick says that Sejanus must have murdered Drusus in self-defense because only Tiberius stood between the Praetorian Prefect {{and the end of}} his career at the hands of Drusus. Furthermore, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> even less likely that Livilla would have been complicit in the destruction of her family, the key to her children's future. Levick dismisses the accusation of Apicata as the revenge of a woman whose husband left her for another.|$|E

500|$|On 12April, {{opposition}} leaders appear on private television, where they disclose their plan to unseat Chávez. Carmona is {{sworn in as}} president while images play of unrest on the streets. Defying media censorship, Chávez's supporters disseminate the story {{that the president did}} not resign. On 13April, they gather to protest outside Miraflores, while palace guards plot to retake the building. The guards take up key positions and, at a prearranged signal, take members of the new government prisoner. The state television channel is relaunched and urges the army to back Chávez. [...] "Full military control" [...] is returned to the Chávez administration and the president arrives at the palace amid celebratory scenes. Chávez makes an address in which <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> fine to oppose him, but not the Constitution of Venezuela. The closing titles say Carmona fled to Miami while under house arrest, and that Ortega went into hiding, only reappearing to help lead the opposition after Chávez said there would be no repercussions. Most of the dissident generals, after being expelled from the army, fled to the US. Others remained as part of the opposition.|$|E
2500|$|Ignatieff {{states that}} despite its admirable {{commitment}} to equality and group rights, Canadian society still places an unjust burden {{on women and}} gays and lesbians, and <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> still difficult for newcomers of non-British or French descent to form an enduring sense of citizenship. Ignatieff attributes this to the [...] "patch-work quilt of distinctive societies," [...] emphasizing that civic bonds will only be easier when the understanding of Canada as a multinational community is more widely shared.|$|E

"where two persons {{embark on}} a joint enterprise, each is liable for the acts done in pursuance of that joint enterprise, that that {{includes}} liability for unusual consequences if they arise from {{the execution of the}} agreed joint enterprise but (and this is the crux of the matter) that, if one of the adventurers goes beyond what had been tacitly agreed as part of the common enterprise, his co-adventurer is not liable for the consequences of that unauthorised act. Finally, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for the jury in every case to decide whether what was done was part of the joint enterprise, or went beyond it and was in fact an act unauthorised by that joint enterprise." ...|$|E
2500|$|While under Ayyubid rule in 1226, Arab {{geographer}} Yaqut al-Hamawi mentions it as Majdal Yafa or [...] "Tower of Jaffa", {{probably due}} to its proximity {{to the city of}} Jaffa. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a village with a [...] "formidable fort".|$|R

2500|$|Art {{historian}} Lauren Soth {{also finds}} a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, {{saying that the}} painting is a [...] "traditional religious subject in disguise" [...] and a [...] "sublimated image of [...] deepest religious feelings." [...] Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Eugène Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night. He criticizes Schapiro's and Loevgren's biblical interpretations, dependent as {{they are on a}} reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the sun. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing [...] "consolation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Melly becomes {{ill with}} a miscarriage. [...] On her deathbed, she tells Scarlett {{to look after}} Ashley, and to be kind to Rhett as he helped her with money without Ashley knowing. [...] Outside, Scarlett realises that Ashley loves Melly, and he never loved her. [...] She runs home, telling Rhett that she must have loved him for years. [...] But she is too late; <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> over. [...] Scarlett asks him what she will do if he goes, but as he leaves, {{he says that he}} doesn't [...] "give a damn".

2500|$|Defendants who can {{anticipate}} their arrest often dress with the perp walk in mind. Two former federal prosecutors turned defense attorneys advise that a white-collar defendant [...] "should {{be prepared to}} look as professional as possible under the circumstances," [...] as the fictional character Sherman McCoy does after he surrenders to face a charge stemming from a hit-and-run accident in Tom Wolfe's 1987 novel The Bonfire of the Vanities. New York publicist Mortimer Matz recommends an old raincoat. In addition to concealing the handcuffs, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not a problem when the garment inevitably gets smudged by fingerprint ink remaining on the defendant's hands. New York Mafia boss John Gotti wore the expensive custom-tailored suits that earned him his [...] "Dapper Don" [...] nickname during perp walks, {{in contrast to the}} sweatpants and jackets seen among other contemporary organized-crime figures.|$|E

2500|$|Klatzow {{contends that}} {{conversation}} {{of the crew}} suggests that the fire started above the South China Sea, shortly after takeoff; he believes that this indicates that the voice recorder was not working {{for a long period}} of the flight or that the crew turned it off (Cockpit Voice Recorders in aircraft at that time only recorded 30 minutes [...] ). [...] If this is the case, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> then likely that an unknown number of the passengers would have already died from smoke inhalation from the first fire. [...] Klatzow believes that theory is consistent with reports that find most of the passengers were in the first class area of the plane at the front as smoke from the back of the plane forced them to move forward. [...] The captain did not land the aircraft directly after the fire, Klatzow argues, because if he had he would have been arrested for endangering the lives of his passengers and it would have caused a major problem for South Africa, costing the country and SAA R400 million. [...] Klatzow argues that the captain, who was also a reservist in the South African Air Force, would therefore have been ordered to carry on to South Africa in hopes of making it there before the aircraft's structural integrity gave in. [...] These points have been refuted by others.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} month, Kathy {{is shocked}} when Gavin appears in her home. She threatens {{to call the}} police, but he asks her to pass on a message to Sharon, revealing {{that he has been}} on holiday with her and Dennis, but she left. Dot Branning (June Brown) then arrives, and eventually she remembers Gavin from his childhood in Walford, saying that he was a troublemaker who stole money from Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), and warns Kathy off getting involved. Gavin simply says he wants the opportunity to be a good father and grandfather, and cries when he remembers that he was unwanted by his own mother. After Dot leaves, Kathy realises that Gavin does not like being on his own and promises to pass on the messaage. Before he leaves, he kisses Kathy as a thank you, saying he misses her. Kathy speaks to Sharon, who reveals that she left the holiday because Gavin hit Dennis. Sharon meets Gavin who says he did it out of love but Sharon wants nothing to do with him. Later, Sharon discovers that Gavin has collected Dennis from school and given him a mobile phone. She meets Gavin and offers him £100,000 to leave forever, revealing that she is selling her half of her bar to fund this. Gavin asks her for another chance but she rejects him and he leaves. After Sharon tells Gavin it will take some weeks to get the money, Gavin sees Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) and her family and concludes that they must be wealthy. Gavin blackmails Clauedtte, threatening to reveal a secret from her past. Claudette attempts to pay Gavin with sex, but afterwards <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not a payment and asks how Claudette killed her husband, Henry. When he demands more money, she strikes him over the head with a candelabra. She believes he is dead and takes him to the basement, and when her son Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) arrives, she lies about the circumstances, but when Gavin escapes, her lies are revealed to Vincent. Gavin returns to Claudette's home and meets Vincent, who says Claudette has left the country. Gavin says he will track her down, so Vincent offers to pay off the money Gavin claims she owes him. Sharon then meets Gavin and gives him the money from her sale of her bar (to Vincent), and he asks for a reconciliation but she rejects him. He meets Margaret, saying she will get her share of the money, and states that Sharon is now dead to him as he has another plan, which Margaret calls [...] "insane".|$|E
