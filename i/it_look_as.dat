5|$|Deimatic {{behaviour}} {{is found}} in cephalopods including the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, squid such as the Caribbean reef squid (Sepioteuthis sepioidea) and bigfin reef squid (Sepioteuthis lessoniana), octopuses including the common octopus Octopus vulgaris and the Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Octopus macropus), and the paper nautilus (Argonauta argo). Deimatic cephalopod displays involve suddenly creating bold stripes, often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> big and threatening as possible.|$|E

It was renovated to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> {{it was in}} the 1950s when Lennon lived there, and Ono paid a visit before it was opened to the public. Lennon's cousin, Michael Cadwallader, had advised the National Trust on how the house looked when the Smiths lived there.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{revisited}} {{the scene}} in the 1997 Special Edition release of A New Hope, restoring the sequence and replacing Mulholland with a CGI version of Jabba the Hutt and the English dialogue with Huttese, a fictional language created by sound designer Ben Burtt. Joseph Letteri, the visual effects supervisor for the Special Edition, explained that the ultimate goal of the revised scene was to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> if Jabba the Hutt was actually on the set talking to and acting with Harrison Ford and that the crew had merely photographed it. Letteri stated that the new scene consisted of five shots that took over a year to complete. The scene was polished further for the 2004 release on DVD, improving Jabba's appearance with advancements in CGI techniques, although neither release looks exactly like the original Jabba the Hutt puppet.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Mail Case or R v Kylsant & Otrs was a noted English {{criminal}} case in 1931. The {{director of the}} Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, Lord Kylsant, had falsified a trading prospectus {{with the aid of}} the company accountant to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> if the company was profitable and to entice potential investors. Following an independent audit instigated by HM Treasury, Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor, were arrested and charged with falsifying both the trading prospectus and company records and accounts. Although they were acquitted of falsifying records and accounts, Kylsant was found guilty of falsifying the trading prospectus and sentenced to twelve months in prison. The company was then liquidated, and reconstituted as The Royal Mail Lines Ltd with the backing of the British government.|$|E
5|$|Upon Philip's return, he {{dispatched}} Alexander {{with a small}} {{force to}} subdue revolts in southern Thrace. Campaigning against the Greek city of Perinthus, Alexander {{is reported to have}} saved his father's life. Meanwhile, the city of Amphissa began to work lands that were sacred to Apollo near Delphi, a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. Still occupied in Thrace, he ordered Alexander to muster an army for a campaign in southern Greece. Concerned that other Greek states might intervene, Alexander made <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> though he was preparing to attack Illyria instead. During this turmoil, the Illyrians invaded Macedonia, only to be repelled by Alexander.|$|E
5|$|Aside from humans, {{octopuses}} may be preyed on by fishes, seabirds, sea otters, pinnipeds, cetaceans, {{and other}} cephalopods. Octopuses typically hide or disguise themselves by camouflage and mimicry; some have conspicuous warning coloration (aposematism) or deimatic behavior. An octopus may spend 40% {{of its time}} hidden away in its den. When the octopus is approached, it may extend an arm to investigate. 66% of Enteroctopus dolfleini in one study had scars, with 50% having amputated arms. The blue rings of the highly venomous blue-ringed octopus are hidden in muscular skin folds which contract when the animal is threatened, exposing the iridescent warning. The Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Callistoctopus macropus) turns bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. Displays are often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> big and threatening as possible.|$|E

5|$|Mercedes {{enjoys a}} fling with Freddie and then soon begin a relationship. The pair {{get into a}} feud with Grace Black (Tamara Wall) and Trevor over The Loft, which they work in and run. Mercedes is left angry and {{disappointed}} when she walks in on Lindsey and Freddie kissing. When Mercedes discovers that Freddie killed Grace's father Fraser Black (Jesse Birdsall) for his mistreatment of his mother, Sandy Roscoe (Gillian Taylforth), she uses this information to blackmail him. She forms strong friendships with Cindy and Lindsey, whom she bonded with over Doctor Browning's death, and helps Cindy's daughter Holly Cunningham (Amanda Clapham) when she suspects Cindy has had a mental breakdown. Mercedes also helps Theresa, who is serving a prison sentence for Calvin's murder after his brother Sonny Valentine (Aaron Fontaine) had tricked Carmel into reporting Theresa to the police, to escape by forcing a heavily pregnant Theresa to fake labour. Mercedes enters the hospital dressed as a doctor and helps Theresa escape, but Sonny tracks them down. Myra, who has returned from Spain, knocks Sonny unconscious and the three women try to escape, but the police catch them and Theresa is returned to prison although they are eventually able to get her released by making <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> though Sonny manipulated her in to confessing. Mercedes supports John Paul when he reveals that he was raped {{by one of his}} students, Finn O'Connor (Keith Rice) and Mercedes starts a feud with Finn's stepmother Diane O'Connor (Alex Fletcher), who protests Finn's innocence. Mercedes, Myra, Nana and Carmel publicly embarrass Diane and support John Paul in court at Finn's trial, when Finn protests his innocence and lies, claiming that John Paul molested him, but Finn is found guilty for the rape and sent to prison.|$|E

Churchill sacked Wavell but could not have <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> though he was being punished or have Wavell return to England, as embarrassing questions could be raised. Churchill had Wavell exchange duties with General Claude Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief, India. Along with Wavell went Michael O'Moore Creagh, who was replaced by Gott.|$|E
25|$|Silas, born 17 March 1948, {{is the son}} of Nancy Blissett. Silas {{became a}} {{journalist}} and married a woman named Joan. They had two children, Heidi (Kim Tiddy) and Wendy. Silas told his family that Joan was murdered by an intruder she disturbed, and that he'd found her body, but it was later revealed that Silas had discovered that Joan {{was having an affair with}} her neighbour and Silas killed her, making <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> though she'd been killed by a burglar. Silas faked a heart attack after killing Joan, although it was later treated as a false alarm by the local hospital.|$|E

25|$|Shares {{had been}} issued {{in the names}} of Peto, Betts, Crampton and their acquaintances, and the LCDR {{accounts}} written up to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> though either the associated cash payment had been made directly to Peto and Betts to fund the construction of the line, or the money, having been paid to the railway company, had temporarily been lent back to the new shareholders. In fact, no cash had changed hands at all, but on the strength of these fictitious entries, the statutory declaration was made before a justice of the peace and authority given to raise loans.|$|E
25|$|Montoto {{went on to}} be the {{president}} of Metropolitano, a railway consortium. During Montoto's tenure in this position, the General Audit Office and ARI both issued reports stating that the awarding of this concession to him had led to deterioration in the railway service. Montoto's partnership in this and other early ventures with Sergio Tasselli, a leading K-businessman, also raised questions at the time. In 2003, La Nación said that Tasselli, whose businesses, according to the newspaper, are always under “a pall of suspicion,” was “quietly building an economic empire” that was growing “in the shadows,” and that his “associates generally do not come from the world of business but from the world of politics, such as former Montoneros leader Mario Montoto.” Instead of improving the train service provided by Metropolitano, Montoto reportedly directed Alejandra Rafuls to film train operations and to edit the film {{in such a way as}} to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> if customers were themselves responsible for the service problems.|$|E
25|$|Fairy Rosebud {{enters the}} Abode of Demon Alcohol, who {{complains}} bitterly {{about the law}} that requires demons to speak in verse; and indeed he is very bad at it. Rosebud is depressed because the Fairy Queen has {{told her that her}} incompetence can no longer be tolerated; unless she becomes more attentive to her duties of protecting mortals from demons, she will be sent to the back row of the ballet chorus. She had decided to protect and assist Aloysius Parfitt, a clergyman, and Jane Collins, a nurse. Jane has attracted the attention of Sir Trevor Mauleverer, a colonel in the Life Guards, who Rosebud believes to be a wicked baronet. Rosebud asks the demon to carry Jane off to Sir Trevor's apartment (making <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> if Sir Trevor has had her carried off) so that Rosebud can then rescue Jane and restore her to Aloysius. The demon is attracted to Rosebud and agrees. However, Jane is really Lady Angela Wealdstone, a lady of fashion, in disguise, and Sir Trevor is really an honourable man. Nevertheless, Lady Angela has run away from home to avoid being forced by her father into an arranged marriage with Sir Trevor.|$|E

25|$|The {{resulting}} aircraft—a midwing monoplane {{of mostly}} wooden construction dubbed the Stipa-Caproni or Caproni Stipa—was strikingly ungainly in appearance. The fuselage was a barrel-like tube, short and fat, open {{at both ends}} to form the tapered duct, with twin open cockpits in tandem mounted in a hump on top of it. The wings were elliptical and passed through the duct and the engine nacelle inside it. The duct itself had a profile {{similar to that of}} the airfoils, and a fairly small rudder and elevators were mounted on the trailing edge of the duct, allowing the ducted propeller wash to flow directly over them as it exited the fuselage to improve handling. The propeller was mounted inside the fuselage tube, flush with the leading edge of the fuselage, and the 120-horsepower de Havilland Gipsy III engine that powered it was mounted within the duct behind it at the midpoint of the fuselage. The aircraft had low, fixed, spatted main landing gear and a tailwheel, making <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> if it was squatting when on the ground. It was painted in a blue-and-cream scheme of the type used on racing aircraft of the day, and its rudder bore the colors of the Italian flag.|$|E
25|$|The Classical Revival {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Nathan C. Wyeth, an architect {{in private practice in}} the city, and Major Max C. Tyler, an engineer with the Army Corps of Engineers. The legislation authorizing the bridge's construction required that the United States Department of War consult with the United States Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) {{in the design of the}} bridge. Subsequently, the Chief of Engineers of the Army Corps of Engineers asked the CFA for a list of architects whom the CFA believed would be competent to design an aesthetically pleasing bridge. The CFA swiftly provided a list, and in July 1916 Tyler met with the CFA to discuss a short list of potential architects. The CFA and Tyler also conferred on the bridge's orientation, design, and approaches. Tyler selected Wyeth. The plans were nearly complete by September. Wyeth and Tyler's initial design for the bridge was a double-deck structure with a single, high span. But with World War I erupting in Europe, inflation made this structure too costly. Wyeth then submitted a design for a single-deck, single-span bridge on January 12, 1917. The CFA asked Wyeth to design a multi-span bridge, or, failing that, to construct non-structural decorative elements that would make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> if the bridge had multiple spans. Wyeth agreed, and the CFA approved the bridge design.|$|E

[...] At the same time, he had been falsifying accounting records by drawing money from the reserves and having it appear on the records as profit.

500|$|While filming Weir {{guiding the}} team to find the ZPM, {{the fact that she}} can see [...] "everything" [...] without looking at {{anything}} was a hard sell for an actor, but with Higginson's drive in her eyes, this would make the scene more believable for the audience. The scene was not written in the original script. The set for the core room in the Asuran city was the same set as Atlantis' gate room, though in order to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> different as possible, the cameras were placed at angles not usually used for filming in the gate room, such as where they would normally place lights.|$|E
500|$|For Khan and his followers, Fletcher {{created a}} strong {{contrast}} with the highly organized Starfleet uniforms; his idea was that the exiles' costumes were made out of whatever they could find. Fletcher said, [...] "My intention with Khan was to express {{the fact that they}} had been marooned on that planet with no technical infrastructure, so they had to cannibalize from the spaceship whatever they used or wore. Therefore, I tried to make <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> if they had dressed themselves out of pieces of upholstery and electrical equipment that composed the ship." [...] Khan's costume was designed with an open chest to show Ricardo Montalbán's physique. Fletcher also designed smocks for the Regula I scientists, and civilian clothes for Kirk and McCoy that were designed to look practical and comfortable.|$|E
