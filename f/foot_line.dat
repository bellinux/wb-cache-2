2500|$|Lombardi's Packers {{hosted the}} Dallas Cowboys in Green Bay on December 31, 1967 in the NFL Championship Game of 1967. This {{became known as}} the [...] "Ice Bowl" [...] because of the −13°F game time temperature. Lombardi had a heating coil {{underneath}} the field but on this day it was not functioning, some people believe that he turned it off on purpose. With 16 seconds left in the game and down by 3 points, the Packers called their final time-out. It was 3rd and goal on the Dallas 2 <b>foot</b> <b>line.</b> In the huddle, with the game on the line, Starr asked Kramer whether he could get enough traction on the icy turf for a wedge play and Kramer responded with an unequivocal yes. Quarterback Bart Starr came over to Lombardi on the sidelines to discuss the last play and told him he wanted to run a 31 wedge, but with him keeping the ball. Lombardi told Starr to 'Run it! And let's {{get the hell out of}} here!' Lombardi was asked by Pat Peppler what play Starr would call, to which Lombardi replied, 'Damned if I know.' Starr returned to the huddle and called a Brown right 31 Wedge, but with him keeping the ball. Kramer blocked Jethro Pugh low and Ken Bowman hit Pugh high as Starr followed them into the end zone for the Packer lead and eventual victory.|$|E

500|$|In the Western poetic tradition, meters are customarily grouped {{according}} to a characteristic metrical foot {{and the number of}} <b>feet</b> per <b>line.</b> The number of metrical <b>feet</b> in a <b>line</b> are described using Greek terminology: tetrameter for four feet and hexameter for six feet, for example. Thus, [...] "iambic pentameter" [...] is a meter comprising five <b>feet</b> per <b>line,</b> in which the predominant kind of foot is the [...] "iamb". This metric system originated in ancient Greek poetry, and was used by poets such as Pindar and Sappho, and by the great tragedians of Athens. Similarly, [...] "dactylic hexameter", comprises six <b>feet</b> per <b>line,</b> of which the dominant kind of foot is the [...] "dactyl". Dactylic hexameter was the traditional meter of Greek epic poetry, the earliest extant examples of which are the works of Homer and Hesiod. Iambic pentameter and dactylic hexameter were later used by a number of poets, including William Shakespeare and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, respectively.

5000|$|Pesky's Pole, {{commonly}} referred to as The Pesky Pole, is the nickname for the right field foul pole at Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox.
