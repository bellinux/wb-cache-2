5|$|Despite these successes, Parsons, {{the project}} {{engineer}} of Aerojet's Solid Fuel Department, remained motivated {{to address the}} malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning when using solid rocket fuel, as the military demanded JATOs that could provide over 100 pounds of thrust without any risk of exploding. Although solid fuels such as GALCIT-27 were more storable than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust {{and did not have}} the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27's stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former's ammonium nitrate with <b>guanidine</b> nitrate. To avoid the problems seen with ammonium nitrate, he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel's binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year had the idea of using liquid asphalt as an appropriate binding agent with potassium perchlorate as oxidizer.|$|E

Some AIPGs were similarly potent and efficacious at hH 2 R-Gs and gpH 2 R-Gs. AIPGs stabilized the ternary complex in hH 2 R-Gs and gpH 2 R-Gs differently than the corresponding <b>guanidines.</b> <b>Guanidines,</b> AIPGs, and small H 2 R agonists exhibited distinct agonist properties at hH 2 R, gpH 2 R, and rH 2 R measuring adenylyl cyclase activity.

This is remarkable because, so far, all bulky H 1 R agonists exhibited higher efficacies at gpH 1 R than at hH 1 R.

25|$|Cleaving {{proteins}} with BrCN requires using {{a buffer}} such as 0.1M HCl (hydrochloric acid) or 70% (formic acid). These {{are the most}} common buffers for cleavage. An advantage to HCl is that formic acid causes the formation of formyl esters, which complicates protein characterization. However, formic is still often used because it dissolves most proteins. Also, the oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide, which is inert to BrCN attack, occurs more readily in HCl than in formic acid, possibly because formic acid is a reducing acid.
