500|$|Byrne {{was carried}} to [...] "The Woolpack" [...] inn in nearby St Albans, {{where he was}} {{attended}} to by Tom Spring. On {{the evening of the}} fight Byrne was considered to be close to death, but {{over the course of the}} following two days he seemed to be recovering, and was sufficiently conscious to thank his friends for their ministrations. But his condition worsened during the afternoon of Saturday 1 June 1833, and he died the following day; the cause of death was given as [...] "congestion of blood in the brain". Byrne himself was reportedly of a different opinion, telling a chambermaid shortly before his death that [...] "If I should die, it will not be from the beating I received but from mortification. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> died than been beaten in that fight." [...] He left behind a wife and four children in Dublin.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November {{was at home}} to Charlton Athletic. The team conceded four {{goals in}} 20 minutes and blew several chances to [...] "kill the game", in what was the club's biggest home defeat in the league under Wenger. An away trip to local rivals Tottenham Hostpur became {{magnified}} with interest, given it marked the return of Campbell following his move to Arsenal. An 81st-minute goal scored by Pirès put Arsenal into the lead, before a lapse by Wright in goal allowed Gus Poyet‘s shot to squirm from his grasp and enter the goalnet. Arsenal then faced league champions Manchester United {{and in spite of}} conceding inside 14 minutes through a Paul Scholes’ strike, Ljungberg equalised for them [...] "with a wonderful chipped finish, following Gary Neville's wretched error." [...] Arsenal improved in the second half but scored in unforeseen fashion: United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez passed the ball directly into the feet of Henry, who profited from the error and scored. Five minutes later, Barthez's failure to grasp the ball presented Henry the chance to score his second, which he did. Both Henry and Wenger defended the opposition goalkeeper, with the former, his international teammate saying: [...] "Of course I was happy to score the goals but it was strange. He's my good friend and I feel sorry for him; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> got them another way." ...|$|E
500|$|There is a {{story that}} the British General James Wolfe read the poem before his troops arrived at the Plains of Abraham in September 1759 as part of the Seven Years' War. After reading the poem, he is {{reported}} to have said: [...] "Gentlemen, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> written those lines than take Quebec tomorrow." [...] Adam Smith, in his 21st lecture on rhetoric in 1763, argued that poetry should deal with [...] "A temper of mind that differs very little from the common tranquillity of mind is what we can best enter into, by the perusal of a small piece of a small length... an Ode or Elegy {{in which there is no}} odds but in the measure which differ little from the common state of mind are what most please us. Such is that on the Church yard, or Eton College by Mr Grey. The Best of Horaces (tho inferior to Mr Greys) are all of this sort." [...] Even Samuel Johnson, who knew Gray but did not like his poetry, later praised the poem when he wrote in his Life of Gray (1779) that it [...] "abounds with images which find a mirror in every breast; and with sentiments to which every bosom returns an echo. The four stanzas beginning Yet even these bones, are to me original: I have never seen the notions in any other place; yet he that reads them here, persuades himself that he has always felt them." ...|$|E

But this I say, that thou leavest not the Laura for {{the desert}} with my good will. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather,</b> <b>had</b> <b>I</b> my wish, see thy wisdom {{installed}} somewhere nearer the metropolis--at Troe or Canopus, for example--where thou mightest be at hand {{to fight the}} Lord's battles. Why wert thou taught worldly wisdom, but {{to use it for}} the good of the Church? It is enough. Let us go.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Wilkerson {{stood by}} his earlier {{description}} of Cheney and Rumsfeld as having formed a cabal to hijack the decision-making process: [...] "I'm worried and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> the discussion and {{debate in the}} process we've designed than I would a diktat from a dumb strongman... I'd prefer to see the squabble of democracy to the efficiency of dictators." ...|$|E

I can truthfully say that there is no person <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> as a judge on a case, no matter what side of any issue I was on, than Dick Honaker." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Italian Petrarch (Francesco di Petracco), {{deemed the}} first full-blooded Humanist, {{wrote in the}} 1330s: [...] "I am alive now, yet <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> been born in another time." [...] He was {{enthusiastic}} about Greek and Roman antiquity. In the 15th and 16th centuries the continuing enthusiasm for the ancients was reinforced by {{the feeling that the}} inherited culture was dissolving and here was a storehouse of ideas and attitudes with which to rebuild. Matteo Palmieri wrote in the 1430s: [...] "Now indeed may every thoughtful spirit thank god that it has been permitted to him to be born in a new age." [...] The renaissance was born: a new age where learning was very important.|$|E

2500|$|The aunts {{resented the}} {{children}} {{for the fact that}} they had to sacrifice their young lives to look after them. It was Mona who was troubled the most by having to care for her niece and nephew. [...] "It was very big of her to take on the responsibility, but having said that, I wish people wouldn't do that. I wish people wouldn't be very big for five minutes and rotten for twenty years. Just keep your 'big' and keep your 'rotten' and get out of my life, because, quite frankly, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> gone to a children's home and be with a lot of other kids being treated the same. To this day, I'm still working on the things she did to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{night before}} her execution, Catherine is {{believed}} to have spent many hours practising how to lay her head upon the block, which had been brought to her at her request. She died with relative composure, but looked pale and terrified; she required assistance to climb the scaffold. She made a speech describing her punishment as [...] "worthy and just" [...] and asked for mercy for her family and prayers for her soul. According to popular folklore, her final words were, [...] "I die a Queen, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> died the wife of Culpeper", however no eyewitness accounts support this. Instead, reporting that she stuck to traditional final words, asking for forgiveness for her sins and acknowledging that she deserved to die 'a thousand deaths' for betraying the king; who had always treated her so graciously. Catherine was beheaded with a single stroke of the executioner's axe.|$|E
2500|$|The indecisive {{outcome of}} the Second Battle of Newbury in October meant {{that by the end}} of 1644 the war still showed no signs of ending. Cromwell's {{experience}} at Newbury, where Manchester had let the King's army slip out of an encircling manoeuvre, led to a serious dispute with Manchester, whom he believed to be less than enthusiastic in his conduct of the war. Manchester later accused Cromwell of recruiting men of [...] "low birth" [...] as officers in the army, to which he replied: [...] "If you choose godly honest men to be captains of horse, honest men will follow them... <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> a plain russet-coated captain who knows what he fights for and loves what he knows than that which you call a gentleman and is nothing else". At this time, Cromwell also fell into dispute with Major-General Lawrence Crawford, a Scottish Covenanter Presbyterian attached to Manchester's army, who objected to Cromwell's encouragement of unorthodox Independents and Anabaptists. He was also charged with familism by Scottish Presbyterian Samuel Rutherford in response to his letter to the House of Commons in 1645.|$|E
6000|$|... "As much so as possible," [...] Morris promised. [...] "It won't be much use, but I shall try. <b>I</b> {{certainly}} <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> you {{easily than}} {{have to fight}} for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will get}} used to him, papa. He seemed {{exceedingly}} tall to me at first--like a tower when I looked up at him; but, on the whole, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> not <b>have</b> him otherwise." ...|$|R

2500|$|Hodgson {{decided to}} leave the series halfway through Season Five due to his dislike of being on-camera and his {{disagreements}} with producer Mallon over creative control of the program. Hodgson also stated that Mallon's insistence to produce a feature film version of the show led to his departure, giving up his rights on the MST3K property to Mallon. Hodgson later told an interviewer: [...] "If I had {{the presence of mind to}} try and work it out, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> stayed. 'Cause I didn't want to go, it just seemed like I needed to." [...] Though they held casting calls for a replacement for Hodgson on camera, the crew found that none of the potential actors really fit the role; instead, having reviewed a test run that Nelson had done with the 'bots, the crew agreed that having Nelson (who had already appeared in guest roles on the show) replace Hodgson would be the least jarring approach. [...] The replacement of Joel by Mike would lead to an oft-jokingly [...] "Joel vs Mike flame war" [...] among fans, similar to the [...] "Kirk vs Picard" [...] discussions in the Star Trek fandom.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his reverses on May 10, Grant {{had reason}} for optimism. The one bright {{spot in the}} day had been the partial success of Emory Upton's {{innovative}} assault. He recognized the failure stemming {{from the lack of}} support and reasoned that using the same tactics with an entire corps might be successful. Grant was then visited by General Wright, the new commander of the VI Corps, who suggested that the May 10 assaults had failed due to poor support, particularly from Mott's division. Wright told General Meade, [...] "General, I don't want Mott's troops on my left; they are not a support. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> no troops there." [...] He assigned Hancock's II Corps to the assault on the Mule Shoe, while Burnside's IX Corps attacked the eastern end of the salient and Warren's V Corps and Wright's VI Corps applied pressure to Laurel Hill. On the morning of May 11, Grant sent a famous message to the Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton: [...] "The result to this time is much in our favor. Our losses have been heavy {{as well as those of}} the enemy. ... I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer." ...|$|E
