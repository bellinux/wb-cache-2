40|$|To {{realize the}} {{benefits}} of BIM in construction management using (4 D and 5 D applications), {{it has to be}} implemented first. There are various BIM <b>implementation</b> <b>plans</b> to select from; with BIM features and guides, companies better understand BIM concepts and can easily choose a plan to apply in their operations. A literature review was conducted and 15 different definitions of BIM were encountered. Twelve different BIM <b>implementation</b> <b>plans</b> were found in publications by academics, software vendors and Architecture/Engineering/Construction (AEC) industry professionals. Those <b>implementation</b> <b>plans</b> were compared using a matrix which covers the complete building lifecycle. This research concludes that out of the 12 <b>implementations</b> <b>plans,</b> three were equipped with additional guides attached to their plans, simplifying project data collection; namely those by Autodesk, Penn State University and Indiana University. One <b>implementation</b> <b>plan</b> that scored very highly (based on 16 key issues identified from the three categories of stakeholders specified in this project) was the <b>implementation</b> <b>plan</b> proposed by a major software vendor. BIM is poised to solve many of the shortcomings reported in the construction industry.
