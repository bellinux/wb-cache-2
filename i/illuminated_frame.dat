40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation {{is to develop a}} system of practical technologies to implement an illumination robust, consumer grade biometric system based on face recognition {{to be used in the}} automotive market. Most current face recognition systems are compromised in accuracy by ambient illumination changes. Especially outdoor applications including vehicle personalization pose the most challenging environment for face recognition. The point of this research is to investigate practical face recognition used for identity management in order to minimize algorithmic complexity while making the system robust to ambient illumination changes. We start this dissertation by proposing an end-to-end face recognition system using near infrared (NIR) spectrum. The advantage of NIR over visible light is that it is invisible to the human eyes while most CCD and CMOS imaging devices show reasonable response to NIR. Therefore, we can build an unobtrusive night-time vision system with active NIR illumination. In day time the active NIR illumination provides more controlled illumination condition. Next, we propose an end-to-end system with active NIR image differencing which takes the difference between successive image frames, one illuminated and one not illuminated, to make the system more robust on illumination changes. Furthermore, we addresses several aspects of the problem in active NIR image differencing which are motion artifact and noise in the difference frame, namely how to efficiently and more accurately align the <b>illuminated</b> <b>frame</b> and ambient frame, and how to combine information in the difference frame and the <b>illuminated</b> <b>frame.</b> Finally, we conclude the dissertation by citing the contributions of the research and discussing the avenues for future work.

The algorithm is neither constrained to a particular PDM model (thus its implementation is practically feasible for any SAR sensor) nor to any external information. These latter are eventually demanded afterwards in order to normalize the returned PDM stack to an absolute reference. The PolPSCal mathematical framework is reported, and a performance analysis with concern to the PS detection and the PDM estimates accuracy is carried out on both synthetic data and a 29 images RADARSAT- 2 dataset...|$|E

40|$|Indirect {{evidence}} suggests that patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) have deficits not only in motor performance, {{but also in the}} processing of sensory information. We investigated the role of sensory information processing in PD patients with a broad range of disease severities and in a group of age-matched controls. Subjects were tested in two conditions: pointing to a remembered visual target in complete darkness (DARK) and in the presence of an <b>illuminated</b> <b>frame</b> with a light attached to the index finger (FRAME). Differences in pointing errors in these two conditions reflect the effect of visual feedback on pointing. PD patients showed significantly larger constant and variable errors than controls in the DARK and FRAME condition. The difference of the variable error in the FRAME and DARK condition decreased {{as a function of the}} severity of PD. This indicates that any deficits in the processing of proprioceptive information occur already at very mild symptoms of PD, and that deficits in the use of visual feedback develop progressively in later stages of the disease. These results provide a tool for early diagnosis of PD and shed new light on the functional role of the brain structures that are affected in PD...|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} these jewels started in 1941. The first 22 were {{acquired}} by the US millionaire Cummins Catherwood. Salvador Dalí made the designs for the pieces on paper, {{with all kinds of}} details and great precision of shapes, materials and colours, while they were made up in New York by the team of the Argentinean-born silversmith Carlos Alemany under the close supervision of the artist himself. In 1958 they were acquired by The Owen Cheatham Foundation, a prestigious US foundation created in 1934 that lent the jewel collection out so that various charitable, educational and cultural organisations could raise funds by exhibiting it, and finally deposited it at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond. Dalí, in collaboration with the Dutch American framemaker Henry Heydenryk, Jr. and Alemany, created special settings and <b>illuminated</b> <b>frames</b> for a traveling exhibition of the jewels sponsored by the Cheatham Foundation. The collection of jewels had already been exhibited temporarily at the Dalí Theatre-Museum in Figueres during the months of August and September 1973, a year before the Museum was inaugurated and while the Master was still alive. In 1981 the collection was acquired by a Saudi multimillionaire, and later by three Japanese entities, the last of which agreed to sell it to the Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation.|$|R

40|$|Purpose High-speed imaging of {{the retina}} {{is crucial for}} obtaining high quality images in the {{presence}} of eye motion. To improve the speed of traditional scanners, a high-speed ophthalmic device is presented using a digital micro-mirror device (DMD) for confocal imaging with multiple simultaneous spots. Methods The PSLO consists of three parts: an illumination, an imaging and a detector arm (Fig. 1). The DMD is uniformly illuminated with a near-infrared (850 nm) LED. The separation between ON positioned mirror elements was made large enough to eliminate cross-talk between neighboring virtual pinholes, and therefore allowed multi-spot confocal imaging across the whole field of view (FOV). The DMD is programmed to project series of shifted point pattern configurations, effectively scanning the spots over the sample surface. The DMD was imaged onto a sample and the returning light was tapped of via a beam-splitter and imaged on a CMOS camera. Multiple point <b>illuminated</b> <b>frames</b> are combined to form one confocal wide-field image. As a proof of principle images of a resolution target were acquired with the PSLO system. Results The resolution target was imaged with a pattern with virtual pinhole size of 2 x 2 mirrors and the separation between two pinholes was 4 mirror elements. Figure 1 B shows the results for combining 9 illumination patterns to form the final image. Conclusions It is possible to create wide-field confocal images with the PSLO system. In theory the DMD can achieve higher frame rates than traditional scanner-based systems by illuminating the sample with multiple spots. In retinal imaging, such a setup will provide better images because higher imaging speeds reduce motion artifacts...|$|R

The claim I make here is that this metaphor has at least four virtues: 1) it offers ways of revisiting the reasons why the arguments failed; 2) it illustrates a peculiar sense of mimesis often disregarded by Plato’s interpreters; 3) it gives the enquiry on piety a cultural context that <b>illuminates</b> the conceptual <b>frame</b> of such enquiry as well as the very notion of piety in Ancient Greece; finally, (4), the metaphor is a joke whose several possible interpretations may say something about the interlocutors of this platonic dialogue as well as about ourselves as Plato’s readers...|$|R

The need for more care workers stems partly from more opportunities for working women and the need for two-income households to safeguard against financial insecurity. In this study, I consider how care and immigration policies in host countries influence one another and explore the implications. I argue that states with less generous care policies (including childcare provisions and leave-time) and states with more working women are more encouraging of migrant and temporary workers. I build a classification scheme that identifies four scenarios of generosity and openness to identify mechanisms that influence the presence of migrant care workers and targeted policies, followed by a mixed methods approach. First, empirical support is presented to verify the exceptional nature of domestic care work versus preferences for skilled workers. Second, case studies, using process tracing and structured, focused comparison, <b>illuminate</b> how the <b>framing</b> and construction of childcare policy and working women affect specific migration policies for domestic workers.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} interrogates {{the relationship}} between medieval French Arthurian romance and Christian spirituality {{through the lens of}} the thirteenth-century prose Queste del Saint Graal, part of the Old French Vulgate Cycle of Arthurian romances. Rather than a systematic allegory of mystical theology or an ironic conscription of religious motifs by self-serving fiction, the Queste is an exploration of and reflection on literary narrative 2 ̆ 7 s capacity to 2 ̆ 2 romance 2 ̆ 2 sacred truth without disavowing its own characteristic mode of writing. As such, it is structured by what the dissertation theorizes as an 2 ̆ 2 allegory effect 2 ̆ 2 constitutive of romance: a sustained textual gesture toward the possibility of narrative 2 ̆ 7 s allegorical interpretability that pointedly fails to resolve itself into an authoritative gloss, leaving the reader responsible for any ultimate determination of meaning, and so turning the ongoing activity of reading into a privileged form of ethical experience. In the Queste, the inherent ambiguity of narrative meaning opens the letter of literary language to the possibility of a genuine truth-content that is not so much dogmatic as effective. The absence of a totalizing gloss drives a series of redemptions performed and thematized by the text. In particular, the predestined, seemingly robotic Grail hero, Galaad, is revealed as a figure of human freedom sustained rather than effaced by divine grace, while his secular, superseded father, Lancelot—the embodiment of the Queste 2 ̆ 7 s own romance paternity, the literary tradition it both continues and redemptively transforms—is recuperated as the subject and object of a discourse of conversion that also articulates the stakes of romance 2 ̆ 7 s rewriting in the Queste, so that romance furnishes the means and occasion for its own spiritualization. In its figuration of reading as a form of pre-eschatological, time-bound redemption made possible by the incomplete and therefore radical legibility of material phenomena, the Queste has deep affinities with the twentieth-century philosophies of history of Walter Benjamin and Siegfried Kracauer, and the dissertation makes use of their thought to <b>illuminate</b> and <b>frame</b> its reading of the medieval text. ...|$|R
40|$|Educational {{language}} {{policy is}} an important tool {{in the struggle to}} achieve educational equity for language minority students, and how educators interpret and appropriate policy in schools {{has much to do with}} its results. Research on educational language policy has faced the perennial question of how to conceptualize and analyze the relationships between what are often seen as macro-level policy and micro-level practices. Following recent trends in research on language-in-social-context, however, language policy scholars are using the concept of spatiotemporal scales to better understand these dimensions and connections (Collins, in press; Hult, 2010). Based on a larger ethnographic study of Spanish/Guarani bilingual education policy implementation in Paraguay, this paper describes how, despite its equalizing promise, a national policy to incorporate Guarani into instruction was appropriated in ways that left rural, Guarani-dominant children marginalized while benefitting urban, Spanish-dominant children. I use hierarchically-ordered sociolinguistic scales (Blommaert, 2007) to explain how sociolinguistic resources—including different varieties of Guarani, ideologies about those varieties, and translanguaging practices—were mobilized in two schools such that, even though Guarani was used in instruction in both places, its use had an up-scaling effect for Spanish dominant students and a down-scaling effect for Guarani-dominant students. I show how the scalar frame more adequately accounts for the largeness and/or smallness of language policy activities, enabling consideration of time, space, and power dimensions at once. And I explore how the scalar <b>frame</b> <b>illuminates</b> opportunities to make language policy work harder and do more good for the education of language minority students...|$|R

In the literature, little attention is being given to mental structures, or cognitive frames, that Latina/o parents and policymakers have regarding college. People use cognitive frames to organize and understand experience. Thus, framing can lead to radically distinct understandings related to college. My study examined how Latina/o parents and policymakers framed the value and purpose of college, who belongs there, and why there is a college access problem. Importantly, I also explored what factors influence the development and maintenance of cognitive frames as well as analyzed race within emerging cognitive frames. Understanding {{the similarities and differences}} in the cognitive frames of Latina/o parents yields critical information about why many Latinas/os do not ultimately pursue a postsecondary education. For policymakers, documenting their <b>frames</b> <b>illuminates</b> ways that they could set policy agendas related to college for Latina/o students. In my study, I used qualitative methods, including semi-structured interviews with 10 Latina/o immigrant parents and eight policymakers in one metropolitan region in Southern California. Findings indicate that Latina/o immigrant parents and policymakers have deep frames for the importance of college, but most Latina/o parents’ frames for college quality are still emerging. A second finding is that most Latina/o immigrant parents frame differential educational opportunities and outcomes in terms of individual circumstances, while policymakers frame these as systemic phenomena. Third, while sources of college information that shape the frames of Latina/o parents and policymakers are different, both rely on their own experiences to shape their frames about college. Lastly, most Latina/o parents held an equity frame where all children should go to college, while most policymakers held the frame of choice where all children should have the choice to go to college...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of jazz embodies a contradiction between the solitary listening practices implied by conventional music analysis and the socially integrative nature of jazz performance events. This dissertation develops a rationale and method for the {{analysis of}} jazz that seeks to transcend this opposition. I formulate an interdisciplinary approach that I call “situational particularism” to explore the complex relationships between situational structure (a function of the social, economic, temporal, spatial, and acoustic organization of musical events), music perception, and social behavior. The configuration of these elements in each musical situation is shown to express a potential for the production of musical community. Unlike more conventional approaches to analysis, a situational perspective incorporates the special conditions of jazz performance and the athleticism of jazz improvisation within accounts of the particularity of individual performances. ^ Situational particularism recuperates and extends an analytical paradigm known as “particularism,” which was defined and discredited by Matthew Brown and Douglas Dempster. It pursues an understanding of musical details beyond the general context stipulated by the “work-concept” to the actual events in which we encounter them. I draw on recent research in cognitive semantics to develop a novel theory of the musical object as a cognitive formation that emerges in musical situations. I then employ language and concepts of sociologist Erving Goffman to <b>illuminate</b> how participants <b>frame</b> their understanding of these situations, and how this understanding governs both perception and behavior. To illuminate these issues, I present case study analyses of two performances—one recorded and one live—by jazz bassist Ron Carter of his composition “Blues for D. P. ” I conclude by examining recent trends in jazz history in terms of the typical situations in which we listen to the music today. Jazz analysis is seen in this context as one of several factors that have worked toward the dissolution of local jazz communities outside of New York. As an analytical approach, by contrast, situational particularism finds its rationale in advocating for musical situations in which music can fulfill its “erotic” social potential—i. e., situations in which music serves an integrative social function. ...|$|R
40|$|Time-resolved optical imaging {{technique}} {{has been used}} to image the spatial distribution of small droplets and jet sprays in a highly scattering environment. The snake and ballistic components of the transmitted pulse are less scattered, and contain direct information about the sample to facilitate image formation as opposed to the diffusive components which are due to multiple collisions as a light pulse propagates through a scattering medium. In a time-gated imaging scheme, these early-arriving, image-bearing components of the incident pulse are selected by opening a gate for an ultrashort period of time and a shadowgram image is detected. Using a single shot cooled CCD camera system, the formation of water droplets is monitored as a function of time. Picosecond time-gated image of drop in scattering cells, spray droplets as a function of let speed and gas pressure, and model calcification samples consisted of calcium carbonate particles of irregular shapes ranging in size from 0. 1 to 1. 5 mm affixed to a microscope slide have been measured. Formation produced by an impinging jet will be further monitored using a CCD with 1 kHz <b>framing</b> <b>illuminated</b> with pulsed light. The desired image resolution of the fuel droplets is on the 20 pm scale using early light through a highly scattering medium. A 10 (exp - 6) m displacement from a jet spray with a flow speed of 100 m/sec introduced by the ns grating pulse used in the imaging is negligible. Early ballistic/snake light imaging offers nondestructive and noninvasive method to observe the spatial distribution of hidden objects inside a highly scattering environment for space, biomedical, and materials applications. In this paper, the techniques we will present are time-resolved K-F transillumination imaging and time-gated scattered light imaging. With a large dynamic range and high resolution, time-gated early light imaging has the potential for improving rocket/aircraft design by determining jets shape and particle sizes. Refinements to these techniques may enable drop size measurements in the highly scattering, optically dense region of multi-element rocket injectors. These types of measurements should greatly enhance the design of stable, and higher performing rocket engines...|$|R

D may be requested by emailing ir@ul. ieMy dance practice research examines and reflects on what I {{experience as a}} deep symbiotic relationship between the body-mind and environment, {{through the creation of}} two original choreographic works. This mixed-mode heuristic, consists of a studiobased and a text-based strand of enquiry, through which I reflect the multiple perspectives and states of awareness traversed as a dancer, choreographer and performer. The studio-based strand revolves around two creative processes I entered into, which resulted in the choreographic works at the core of this research – a three-screen video dance installation called TerrainSkin and a live collaborative multi-disciplinary (dance, video and visual art) performance installation called TerrainSkin:FourDimensionalFlow (TerrainSkin: 4 DFlow). The text-based strand aims to reflect the intimate nature of my moving experience in site-specific environments, the two creative processes that I entered into, and the performance of the two choreographic works. In both the studio and text-based strand, as ‘thematic strands’ or ‘theoretical insights’ emerge directly out of my dance and choreographic enquiry, I simultaneously engage with the canon of Western contemporary dance and the field of site-specific dance. I also engage with theoretical fields of Philosophy, Psychology and Science/Physics to deepen my investigation into specific aspects of these thematic strands. The first thematic strand reflects what I experienced as a deep reciprocal interconnectedness between my moving body and environment where notions of separate, fragmented, polarised, dualistic ideologies are diminished and experienced as re-integrated continuums. The other two thematic strands are conceptualised as ‘the energetic body’ and ‘the kinaesthetic body’. It is through these two bodies, generated within my dance practice as states of heightened kinaesthetic and energetic awareness, that directly support my experience of a symbiotic interconnectedness between my body-mind and environment. As part of this research I created an experiential pyschosomatic dance, choreographic and performance method/practice called Generating States which supports me to <b>frame,</b> <b>illuminate</b> and deepen my investigation into all three thematic strands. Through my choreographic work, I aim to provide insight into a particular way of being in the world – through the intimate lens of an immersive moving experience. I trace the multi-disciplinary nature of my practice through my engagement with video and performance installation, to support me in constructing immersive performance environments that might generate an embodied kinaesthetic and/or energetic response...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this thesis, I have {{explored}} how an online community fosters communication and knowledge sharing {{in a global}} company. Based on empirical findings in this study, combined with theoretical aspects and previous research, I aimed to do research in one online community in a global oil service company. I was curious about how an online community, such as The Edge, can foster communication and knowledge sharing among the employees in the Company. My research questions aimed to explore what characterise {{the use of an}} online community, how knowledge sharing is facilitated and what impact cultural differences could have on the level of activity in an online forum. Through the sociocultural approach (Clark, 1991;Vygotsky, 1978; Rommetveit, 1979; Wertsch, 1998), the thesis explores how technology as a mediating artefact promotes communication, intersubjectivity, common ground and knowledge sharing. Other theories are used, along with previous research, to <b>illuminate</b> the problem <b>framing</b> of the thesis and the research questions. The study has a qualitative approach, where I conduct a virtual ethnography of the discussion forum in The Edge, and qualitative interviews with four active members of the community. Such a triangulation of the collected data, contributes by enhancing the validity of case study findings. The data analysis is inspired by an interactional and content analysis and interpreted with an abductive approach. The collected data from the discussion forum were first organized in an Excel document, where the approached participants were found. From the transcripts from the interviews, four categories were identified, and the collected data was analysed in light of these. The thematic categories constituted the basis for the theoretical discussion in the thesis. 1. The Edge as an Online Community 2. Learning at Work 3. Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing 4. Linguistic Challenges The data indicates that the level of activity in the online community in the SDS network is high. The employees chose to participate to help others, keep updated on the posted topics because it is expected of them to be active. One may argue that The Edge consists of different communities of practice, with different fields of interest. For the company, as a global business, it is an advantage that the online community allows communication asynchronously, regardless of time and place. The Edge facilitate knowledge sharing with a workload-reducing function, It is a community that stores and obtain knowledge and support both primary and secondary work activities. Multiple learning strategies are used in the SDS network, with indications of allowing both a fix-it-level and a reflection level. Technical questions are structured within primary work tasks, and ideas and suggestions is found within secondary work. Cultural differences consist of linguistic barriers within the community. This may cause complication in the communication and affect the level of activity. Intersubjectivity and a common ground is crucial to achieve knowledge sharing. By succeeding this on this aspect, {{it might be possible to}} transfer tacit knowledge to explicit knowledge in the company, as knowledge from the world to knowledge in the head. &emsp...|$|R

The Nordic tradition of curriculum design emphasizes children’s performance and defines goals to strive for without specifying the objects of achievement. The other tradition to curricula design presented in the chapter, the Anglo-Saxon tradition, {{is characterized by the}} focus on the individual and by detailed formulations of goals to achieve for different age categories. The chapter discusses the contradictory tendencies of de- and re-centralization in the Nordic curricula, evident for example in the regulations and directions concerning documentation and assessment. It also argues that we can recognize a movement towards the Anglo-Saxon tradition of curriculum design in the Nordic countries. Chapter 3 ‘Different Forms of Documentation and Assessment in ECE’ familiarizes the reader with the documentation practices of Nordic early education at the grass root level. Drawing on a case study of three Swedish preschools, it illuminates the types of documentation tools that are applied in ECE. It proposes that the documentation practices can best be characterized by the term multi-documentation. The examination of the multi-documentation shows how the documentation tools comprise different forms of assessment, ranging from developmental-psychological, narrative and activity oriented assessments to self- and personality assessments. Finally, the chapter raises questions about in what sense the documentation and assessment practices are about empowering, supporting, and strengthening children, parents and professionals and in what sense they can weaken, mislead, and constrain the different actors. The fourth chapter, which ends {{the first part of the}} book, ‘Teachers in intensified assessment and documentation practices - a didaktik approach’ builds on the previous chapter and considers documentation and assessment practices and teachers’ role in them from the view of the reflective, Continental approach of didaktik. It approaches documents as co-actors in educational processes on focuses on the following questions regarding it: why (the function), who (subjects/actors), what (the content) and how (the form). The chapter introduces the concept of transformative assessment as a boundary object between different forms and functions of assessment and between micro-, meso- and macro-level actors of assessment and documentation practices. The preschool teachers’ role can be described as trans-actors in the transformative multi-documentation and assessment. The second part of the book, ‘Auditing the child’ with its two chapters will move the focus to the social study of childhood and consider the notions of the child in documentation and assessment from two different starting points. Chapter 5, ‘Documentation and listening to the children’, begins its discussion from a common understanding of child documentation as a means to give children a ‘voice’. By drawing on empirical data from parent-teacher discussions considering children’s responses to specific questions, the chapter problematizes this notion. It argues that despite of its benevolent aims, listening to children through documentation is constrained by and deeply embedded in, institutional and generational practices and assumptions about professionalism in ECE. Consequently, the child’s view can be ‘lost in translation’. Chapter 6, ‘The normal child’, continues the discussion about the notions of the child by inviting the reader to consider how documentation and assessment practices produce normative ideas about the child and how these ideas are intertwined with the social order of the ECE institution. This order both controls and empowers the institutional actors in different ways. The chapter illustrates how the ‘ordinary’ or ‘normal’ child is produced in written documentation and in the intertwinement of text and talk. It also illuminates how the assessments and the normative function of documentation are predominantly implicit and actualized, especially, when the child shows ‘resistance’ of the system of ECE or otherwise departs from its expectations. The third part of the book positions ‘Parenthood on focus’ and consists of two chapters. Chapter 7, ‘The governance and pedagogicalization of parents’, highlights the demands on parents in the documentalized practices used to establish collaboration between home and ECE. It considers practices and tools that are used to involve parents in the assessment and documentation of their child and the family. Through them, the parents are expected to embrace the ideas and discourses of the ECE institution. Furthermore, the documentalized practices yield unspoken expectations about how the parents should support their child in lifelong learning and how they can meet the institutional norms of good parenting. Chapter 8, ‘Parenthood between offline and online – about assessment and documentation’ draws on a ‘netnographic’ research on what parents write about assessment and documentation of children on Internet sites. In the discussions parents are free from the institutional constraints that are evident, for example, in parent-teacher meetings. The chapter considers whose interests seem to be involved in the discussions and who is assessing whom. Moreover, it considers in what ways the discussions can be seen both as empowering and constraining parenthood. The final chapter, ‘Conclusion: Dilemmas of documentation’, ties together the key points of the preceding chapters by discussing the ‘junction’ of discourses and contradictory tendencies that are embedded in the assessment and documentation practices of Nordic ECE, regarding children, parents, and professionals. The chapter illuminates the different fields of the contradictory discourses by a multi-dimensional model of the steering of assessment and documentation and proposes the concept of ‘documentalized childhood’ as capturing the function of the steering in the transnational context of contemporary ECE. ...|$|R
