The holes are generally vertical, and mostly in eucalypts, though other trees such as coast banksia (Banksia integrifolia) have been recorded. Some sites are reused for up to 20 years, especially if broods have been successfully raised in them before. Boobooks may also evict other birds such as galahs (Eolophus roseicapillus) to use their hollows, and have used sites abandoned by babblers, crows and ravens. The male <b>does</b> <b>more</b> of the site preparation, such as lining {{the base of the}} hollow with leaves.|$|E

The construction of the Patuca II hydroelectric plant in the Patuca river highlights the elements of the debate.

A lot of the reserve does not have developed roadways or power. A hydroelectric facility would require development throughout the reserve.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the career}} gains women have made, their husbands have not reached parity {{in terms of}} their {{domestic}} work and care work.

25|$|Similarly, Nystrom noted of the band's live performances: Well, {{it must be}} hard {{sometimes}} for Jonas to sing his heart out with lyrics referring to personal dark and depressive matters {{and at the same}} time also be accused of being a reluctant frontman. I actually think much of the stuff he sings about doesn't go in hand with running around on stage, throwing horns, smiling and firing up the audience. We're not an energetic power metal band. I think the withdrawn and shy aura actually <b>does</b> <b>more</b> justice to the concept of our songs than going wild, but we have some songs mainly on the two last albums that don't really fall into the doom and gloom category, but are still dark. And there the more aggressive approach fits better.|$|E
25|$|With its {{location}} on the Pacific Rim and at the western terminus of Canada's transcontinental highway and rail routes, Vancouver {{is one of the}} nation's largest industrial centres.

In recent years, Vancouver has become a centre for software development, biotechnology, aerospace, video game development, animation studios and television production and film industry. The city's strong focus on lifestyle and health culture also makes it a hub for many lifestyle-brands with Lululemon, Arc'teryx, Kit and Ace, Mountain Equipment Co-op, Herschel Supply Co., Aritzia, Reigning Champ, and Nature's Path Foods all founded and headquartered in Vancouver.|$|E
25|$|The {{balance of}} {{benefits}} versus harms {{of breast cancer}} screening is controversial. A 2013 Cochrane review stated that it is unclear if mammographic screening <b>does</b> <b>more</b> good or harm. A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age, and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years old. The medications tamoxifen or raloxifene {{may be used in}} an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it. Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventative measure in some high risk women. In those who have been diagnosed with cancer, a number of treatments may be used, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and targeted therapy. Types of surgery vary from breast-conserving surgery to mastectomy. Breast reconstruction may take place at the time of surgery or at a later date. In those in whom the cancer has spread {{to other parts of the}} body, treatments are mostly aimed at improving quality of life and comfort.|$|E

500|$|Wanting to do {{more than}} just {{represent}} life and death as an opposition, and instead to show the way in which each is inevitably and profoundly involved with the other, Kiarostami has devised a cinema that <b>does</b> <b>more</b> than just present the viewer with the documentable [...] "facts," [...] but neither is it simply a matter of artifice.

500|$|The {{development}} of process theology has presented {{a challenge to}} the Irenaean theodicy. The doctrine proposes that God is benevolent but suggests that his power is restricted to persuasion, rather than coercion and so is unable to prevent certain evil events from occurring. Process theology accepts God's indirect responsibility for evil, but maintains that he is blameless, and does everything in his power to bring about good. In his introduction to process theology, C. Robert Melse argued that, although suffering does sometimes bring about good, not all suffering is valuable and that most <b>does</b> <b>more</b> harm than good. Process theologian David Griffin contested [...] "the utility of soul making". He argued that the Irenaean theodicy supposes that God inflicts pain for his own ends, which Griffin regarded as immoral.|$|E

500|$|... {{with dark}} splotches, {{so they are}} {{difficult}} for predators to spot on the beach. The precocial chicks fledge in about four weeks after hatching. Tropical species take longer because of the poorer food supply. Both parents incubate the eggs and feed the chicks, although the female <b>does</b> <b>more</b> incubating and less fishing than her partner. Young birds migrate with the adults. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with individuals typically returning for 7–10 breeding seasons. Maximum known ages include 34 for an Arctic tern and 32 for a sooty. Although several other species are known to live in captivity for up to 20 years, their greatest recorded ages are underestimates because the birds can outlive their rings. Interbreeding between tern species is rare, and involves closely related species when it occurs. Hybrids recorded include common tern with roseate, Sandwich with lesser-crested, and black with white-winged.|$|E

[...] He also found it awkward that the Hogwarts Express reverses into Platform [...] at King's Cross—although in Hogsmeade the train arrives facing forwards. Overall Levine said that the attraction <b>does</b> <b>more</b> than just making it a ride, [...] "By making it an integral and compelling part of The Wizarding World, most guests would want to ride it to get the complete Potter experience. By making it an inter-park ride and requiring a two-park ticket to board it, Universal will surely help up-sell a lot more more customers to higher-priced passes, encourage multi-day visits, increase demand for its on-property hotels, and drive business at its CityWalk dining/shopping/entertainment district".|$|E

500|$|Described by the {{developers}} {{as a modern}} version of Gauntlet, The Return of the King is a hack and slash action game played from a third-person perspective. The game {{is very similar to}} its [...] in basic gameplay. Each character has a quick attack which does minimal damage and can be easily blocked, and a fierce attack, which <b>does</b> <b>more</b> damage, but is slower and leaves the player vulnerable to attack. Only fierce attacks can break enemy shields. Each character also has a ranged attack, a [...] "killing move" [...] (which can be used to instantly kill downed enemies), a parry (which can deflect enemy attacks), a knock back (which pushes nearby enemies away), a jump back (in which the player character jumps back away from the enemy), a devastating attack (a charged fierce attack) and a special ability. Playable characters in the console and PC versions are Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Frodo and Sam, with Faramir, Pippin and Merry available as unlockable characters. Playable characters in the GBA version are Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Frodo, Gandalf, and Éowyn, with Gollum and Sam available as unlockable characters.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} the certification courses {{of all four}} instructors, the player is informed that an agent has infiltrated an enemy base ("EVIL Syndicate") on the fictional Izanu Island and has freed the player's kidnapped instructors, who are waiting to be rescued. The player's mission is to fly an attack helicopter from an offshore aircraft carrier and retrieve the captives by landing on a helipad on the island. This rescue mission stands out from the normal courses in that the player <b>does</b> <b>more</b> than maneuver a craft. As the player flies over the island, they must successfully dodge anti-aircraft fire from ground-based turrets, and, although the helicopter is able to fire missiles to destroy the artillery, a single hit to the craft causes the game to end. The helicopter has forward, backward, left, and right pitch controls, rotor throttle controls for altitude, and left and right missile firing controls. Completing the mission earns the player the [...] "Pilot's Wings" [...] certificate and opens harder training areas (consisting of several weather conditions and higher score requirements) and another helicopter mission. Clearing the second helicopter mission awards the player with the golden [...] "Pilot's Wings," [...] and the credits roll.|$|E
500|$|The {{game has}} {{received}} both praise and criticism for its multiple-genre format. It was reviewed by {{four people in}} a 1989 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly shortly {{after the release of}} the game in 1989. Steve Harris said that the game <b>does</b> <b>more</b> than most shoot 'em ups and that it's a [...] "good follow-up for Zanac fans". He added that the multiple-genre format [...] "helps elevate the whole title to a much higher level". Ed Semrad called the game a Blaster Master clone and [...] "only average at best", and he echoed Harris' opinion that those who enjoyed Zanac would enjoy The Guardian Legend. Donn Nauert said that the game is repetitive and offers little challenge and {{that it would have been}} better as a pure shoot 'em up; he pointed to a special password ("TGL") in which players can enter to bypass all of the Labyrinth portions. Jim Allee also compared the game to Zanac and repeated what Nauert said about the lack of difficulty except in the boss battles; he overall praised the game for successfully bringing together two distinct themes.|$|E
