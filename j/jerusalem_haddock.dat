5000|$|Opahs (also {{commonly}} known as moonfish, sunfish (not {{to be confused with}} Molidae), kingfish, redfin ocean pan, and <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>haddock)</b> are large, colorful, deep-bodied pelagic lampriform fishes comprising the small family Lampridae (also spelled Lamprididae). Only two living species occur in a single genus: Lampris (from the Greek lamprid-, [...] "brilliant" [...] or [...] "clear"). One species is found in tropical to temperate waters of most oceans, while the other is limited to a circumglobal distribution in the Southern Ocean, with the 34Â°S as its northern limit. Two additional species, one in the genus Lampris and the other in the monotypic Megalampris, are only known from fossil remains. The extinct family, Turkmenidae, from the Paleogene of Central Asia, is closely related, though much smaller.|$|E
