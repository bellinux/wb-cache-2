This amphipathic helix was hypothesized to bind Ii to class II MHC antigens until release in endosomes containing digested <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen.</b> Then these amphipathic Ii polypeptides might polymerize {{so as not to}} compete with <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> for binding to class II MHC molecules.

50|$|Leukocyte-promoting factor, {{also known}} as leukopoietin, is an {{obsolete}} term used to describe substances that are produced by neutrophils when they encounter a <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen.</b> It stimulates the bone marrow to increase the rate of leukopoiesis, in order to replace the neutrophils that will inevitably be lost when they begin to phagocytose the <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens.</b>|$|R
50|$|Irregular {{antibodies}} are all non-ABO antibodies, {{although the}} main {{use of the}} term is for non-ABO isoantibodies that may cause incompatibility in blood transfusions.

50|$|In {{order for}} an {{adaptive}} immune response to occur T cells need to be activated. T cells become activated by recognising <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens</b> bound to antigen presenting cells (APC), in particular, dendritic cells. In order for naïve T cells to bind to their specific antigen, they need to experience physical contact with those cells. Since antigen levels are usually low, contact in blood circulation would be unlikely. Therefore, T cells need a region where {{they can go to}} sample <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens</b> that have entered the body. When an APC, such as a dendritic cell, binds a <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> it becomes activated and moves into the lymph nodes (sites for antigen sampling by T cells) via afferent lymphatic vessels. Naïve T cells in the circulation regularly move through the lymph nodes via HEV in order to scan the APC for <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens.</b> When they encounter such an antigen, the cell becomes activated, resulting in the immune system mounting a response against the causative agent of the infection.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{intriguing}} properties of T cell population {{is that the}} frequency of the precursors that respond to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I-en-coded alloantigens are several orders of magnitude higher than the frequency of precursors responding to <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens</b> (1, 2). To explain this observation, it has been postulated that at least some T cells responding to the MHC alloantigens are also capable of responding to various <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens.</b> Studies on the specificity of T cell clones provided direct support for this hypothesis. Indeed, several T cell clones recognizing <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens</b> in association with self-MHC-encoded antigens and displaying alloreactivity have been reported (3 - 6). The observation that half of the clones having identical specificity for an insulin epitope recognized in association with syngeneic I-A b gene product also respond to alloantigens of H- 2 u haplotype, indicated that a certain degree of mimicry exists between alloantigens and <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens</b> associated with syngeneic H- 2 gene products (7). Although these studies demonstrate that a single T cell clone specific for antigen in association with a syngeneic H- 2 gen...|$|R

40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) are key {{components}} of the adaptive immune system contributing to initiation and regulation of T cell responses. T cells continuously scan DCs in lymphoid organs {{for the presence of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen.</b> However, {{little is known about the}} functional consequences of these frequent T cell–DC interactions without cognate antigen. Here we demonstrate that these contacts in the absence of <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> serve an important function, namely, induction of a basal activation level in T cells required for responsiveness to subsequent encounters with <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens.</b> This basal activation is provided by self-recognition of MHC molecules on DCs. Following DC depletion in mice, T cells became impaired in TCR signaling and immune synapse formation, and consequently were hyporesponsive to antigen. This process was reversible, as T cells quickly recovered when the number of DCs returned to a normal level. The extent of T cell reactivity correlated with the degree of DC depletion in lymphoid organs, suggesting that a full DC compartment guarantees optimal T cell responsiveness. These findings indicate that DCs are specialized cells that not only present <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen,</b> but also promote a “tonic” state in T cells for antigen responsiveness...|$|R
40|$|Recombinant {{derivatives}} of nonpathogenic bacteria such as attenuated Salmonella typhi {{have the}} potential to be used for delivery of heterologous antigens to the immune system. Genetic factors may modulate the immune responses to these live attenuated organisms and could therefore modify the immunogenicity of future human vaccines. In the present study, we compared the antibody responses of Ity or H- 2 congenic strains of mice to a <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> expressed by the murine attenuated aroA S. typhimurium strain. Our results demonstrate that the Ity gene may modulate the antibody responses to the <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> but that the major genetic influence is exerted by H- 2 genes, which control the capacity of mice to respond to the antigen expressed by recombinant attenuated Salmonella cells. This genetic control is related to differences in responsiveness of different strains of mice to low doses of antigen. Increasing the amount of <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> expressed by recombinant Salmonella cells overcame the genetic restriction of these responses. These findings are potentially of great importance for the design of live vaccines for humans and show that care must be taken to optimize the amount of <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> delivered to the immune system...|$|R
40|$|Various {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed for the initiation of autoimmune responses by autoreactive T-cell clones.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{not known}} how {{immunogenic}} versus tolerogenic cellular responses are signaled by receptors such as the B cell antigen receptor (BCR). Here we compare BCR signaling in naive cells that respond positively to <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> and self-tolerant cells that respond negatively to self-antigen. In naive cells, <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> triggered a large biphasic calcium response and activated nuclear signals through NF-AT, NF-κB, JNK, and ERK/pp 90 rsk. In tolerant B cells, self-antigen stimulated low calcium oscillations and activated NF-AT and ERK/pp 90 rsk but not NF-κB or JNK. Self-reactive B cells lacking the phosphatase CD 45 did not exhibit calcium oscillations or ERK/pp 90 rsk activation, nor did they repond negatively to self-antigen. These data reveal striking biochemical differences in BCR signaling to the nucleus during positive selection by <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens</b> and negative selection by self-antigens...|$|R
40|$|SummaryDeveloping T cells express diverse antigen receptors whose {{specificities}} are not prematched to the <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens</b> {{they eventually}} encounter. Past experiments {{have revealed that}} thymocytes must productively signal in response to self antigens to mature and enter the peripheral T cell pool (positive selection), but how this process enhances effective mature T cell responses to <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> is not fully understood. Here we have documented an unsuspected connection between thymic recognition events and foreign antigen-driven T cell responses. We find that the strength of self-reactivity is a clone-specific property unexpectedly {{directly related to the}} strength of T cell receptor (TCR) binding to presented <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen.</b> T cells with receptors showing stronger interaction with self dominate in responses to infections and accumulate in aging individuals, revealing that positive selection contributes to effective immunity by skewing the mature TCR repertoire toward highly effective recognition of pathogens that pose a danger to the host...|$|R

A new therapeutic approach that we have previously proposed uses nonliving bacterial ghosts (BGs) as a carrier-delivery system which can be engineered to carry <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens</b> and/or be loaded with therapeutic drugs. The parent strain chosen for development of our BG delivery system is the probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN), whose intrinsic properties trigger the innate immune system with the flagella and fimbriae used to attach and stimulate epithelial cells. In previous studies, we have shown that EcN BGs are safe for the ocular surface route, but evidence that EcN BGs retain flagella and fimbriae after transformation, has never been visually confirmed. In this study, we used different visualization techniques to determine whether flagella and fimbriae are retained on EcN BGs engineered either for drug delivery or as a <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> carrier. We have also shown by immunoelectron microscopy that EcN retains two <b>foreign</b> <b>antigens</b> after processing to become EcN BGs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BGs derived from EcN and expressing a <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> attachment to conjunctival epithelial cells in vitro without causing reduced cell viability. These results are an important step in constructing a delivery system based on a nonliving probiotic that is suitable for use in ocular surface diseases pairing immunomodulation and targeted delivery.

40|$|The immune system's {{ability to}} {{distinguish}} self and nonself {{is essential for}} both host defense against foreign agents and protection of self-antigens from autoimmune destruction. Such discrimination is complicated by extensive structural homology shared between <b>foreign</b> and self <b>antigens.</b> One hypothesis to explain {{the development of an}} autoimmune response is that some B cells activated by <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> acquire, through somatic mutation, specificity for both the eliciting <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen</b> and self antigen. If such clones arise frequently, there must be a mechanism for their elimination. We have analyzed the extent of autoreactivity arising in a nonautoimmune host during the response to a <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen.</b> To overcome the process of apoptosis in primary B cells that might routinely eliminate autoreactive clones, we generated B-cell hybridomas from spleen cells of immunized mice by using a fusion partner constitutively expressing bcl- 2. Multiple lines were obtained that recognize simultaneously the hapten phosphorylcholine and the self antigen double-stranded DNA. This dual specificity was not present early but was detected by day 10 after immunization. Some of these cross-reactive antibodies deposit in kidneys in a pattern similar to what is seen in autoimmune disease. These results demonstrate that autoantibodies arise at a high frequency as part of a response to <b>foreign</b> <b>antigen.</b> It has previously been shown that autoreactivity is regulated by central deletion; these data demonstrate a need for negative selection in peripheral lymphoid organs also, to regulate autoantibodies acquiring their self-specificity by somatic mutation...|$|R
