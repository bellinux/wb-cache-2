50|$|The oval-section {{fuselage}} was a frameless monocoque shell {{built in}} two halves being formed to shape by band clamps over a mahogany or concrete mould, each holding {{one half of}} the fuselage, split vertically. The shell halves were made of sheets of Ecuadorean balsawood sandwiched between sheets of Canadian birch, but in areas needing extra strength— such as along cut-outs— stronger woods replaced the balsa filler; the overall thickness of the birch and balsa sandwich skin was only 7/16 in. This sandwich skin was so stiff that no <b>internal</b> <b>reinforcement</b> was necessary from the wing's rear spar to the tail bearing bulkhead. The join along the vertical centre line greatly aided construction as it allowed technicians easy access to the fuselage interior.|$|E

In fact, PCs exhibit high compressive strength and ultimate compressive strain values, as well as good chemical resistance. Within the context of these benefits, this paper presents a study on the time-dependent behavior of polymer concrete columns reinforced with different bar types using a mechanical model recently developed by the authors. Balanced <b>internal</b> <b>reinforcements</b> are considered (i. e., two bars at both {{the top and bottom of}} the cross-section). The investigation highlights relevant stress and strain variations over time and, consequently, the emergence of a significant decrease in concrete&# 8217;s stiffness and strength over time.

This setup unlinked the gondola from the dynamic forces exerted by suspension cables; gondola skin was subjected only to static air pressure. Landing basket, like the crumple zones of modern automobiles, was designed and tested to collapse at impact speeds exceeding 5 meters per second. There were two cast aluminum escape hatches, each with a submarine-style fast-opening lock. Lead ballast was stowed outside the landing basket in forty small bags; by pulling a cable through an airtight driveshaft, operators tumbled the bag upside down, dropping the small lead pellets. In case of emergency, a whole metric ton of ballast could be released {{in less than two}} minutes.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} reason for the continued popularity of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in the machine learning community is that the gradient-descent backpropagation procedure gives ANNs a locally optimal change procedure and, in addition, a framework for understanding the ANN learning performance. Genetic programming (GP) is also a successful evolutionary learning technique that provides powerful parameterized primitive constructs. Unlike ANNs, though, GP does not have such a principled procedure for changing parts of the learned system based on its current performance. This paper introduces Neural Programming, a connectionist representation for evolving programs that maintains the benefits of GP. The connectionist model of Neural Programming allows for a regression credit-blame procedure in an evolutionary learning system.

However, unlike some learning techniques, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), GP {{does not have a}} principled procedure for changing parts of a learned structure based on that structure's performance on the training data.

50|$|A T-beam is a {{structural}} element {{able to withstand}} large loads by resistance in the beam or by <b>internal</b> <b>reinforcements.</b> In some respects, the T-beam {{dates back to the}} first time a human formed a bridge with a pier and a deck. After all, a T-beam is, in one sense, no more than a pillar with a horizontal bed on top, or, {{in the case of the}} inverted T-beam, on the bottom. The upright portion carrying the tension of the beam is termed a web or stem, and the horizontal part that carries the compression is termed a flange. However, the materials used have changed over the years but the basic structure is the same. T-beams structures such as highway overpasses, buildings and parking garages, have extra material added on the underside where the web joins the flange to reduce the T-beam’s vulnerability to shear stress. However, when one investigates more deeply into the design of T-beams, some distinctions appear.|$|R
40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal {{of this research is}} the development of a new, industrially relevant device and process wherein useful structures, such as submicron filaments, evolve directly within a major phase melt that can be subsequently extruded to form fibers or parts with <b>internal</b> <b>reinforcements</b> and enhanced physical properties. Chaotic mixing of thermoplastics has been used recently to produce, in small quantities within batch mixers, polymer blends with either interconnected fibrillar or lamellar microstructures. The novel microstructures evolved directly in the melt from initially coarse minor phase bodies due to the recursive stretching and folding characteristics that typify chaotic responses. Enhanced physical properties have been attributed to the novel microstructures. The results with batch mixers suggest that new, structured blends of potential importance to industry can be produced if chaotic mixing conditions can be established in a practical continuous flow device. Experimental and computational research in support of the design of such a device is reported...|$|R

40|$|Gustatory stimuli {{can support}} both {{immediate}} reflexive behaviour, such as choice and feeding, and can drive <b>internal</b> <b>reinforcement</b> in associative learning. For larval Drosophila, we here provide a first systematic behavioural {{analysis of these}} functions with respect to quinine as a study case of a substance which humans report as "tasting bitter". We describe the dose-effect functions for these different kinds of behaviour and find that a half-maximal effect of quinine to suppress feeding needs substantially higher quinine concentrations (2. 0 mM) than {{is the case for}} <b>internal</b> <b>reinforcement</b> (0. 6 mM). Interestingly, in previous studies (Niewalda et al. 2008, Schipanski et al 2008) we had found the reverse for sodium chloride and fructose/sucrose, such that dose-effect functions for those tastants were shifted towards lower concentrations for feeding as compared to reinforcement, arguing that the differences in dose-effect function between these behaviours do not reflect artefacts of the types of assay used. The current results regarding quinine thus provide a starting point to investigate how the gustatory system is organized on the cellular and/or molecular level to result in different behavioural tuning curves towards a bitter tastant. © 2012 El-Keredy et al...|$|E

The contribution of our research is a detailed approach by which principled credit-blame assignment {{can be brought to}} GP and that credit-blame assignment can be focused to improve that same evolutionary process.
