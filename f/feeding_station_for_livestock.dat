Live- stock carcasses are often disposed of in supplementary <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> <b>for</b> avian scavengers, as a man- agement and conservation tool for these species worldwide.

Using UPLC-MS/MS and HPLC-TOF, we evaluated the presence and concentration of fluoroquinolone residues in plasma of nestling vultures feeding on domestic livestock carrion. Three different fluoroquinolones (marbofloxacin, enrofloxacin and its metabolite ciprofloxacin) and a non-targeted ß-lactam (nafcillin) were detected in vulture plasma.

The four rats were maintained in a large arena with access to eight <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> <b>for</b> two 30 -minute sessions per day.

Dispersion patterns, transition types, reinforcements, and the observed preference for working on the FR or VR side of the arena were studied. Throughout the experiment the rats showed an overwhelming preference for the FR side of the arena. However, there was a gradual decrease in the magnitude of the preference for the FR side of the arena over the course of the experiment. It is therefore concluded that as the cost of food increased rats became more risk-prone in their foraging preference. It is also suggested that had the animals been allowed to experience a negative net energy budget (i. e., starvation) a more powerful effect would have emerged...|$|R
40|$|Foraging {{behaviour}} plays a {{key role}} in the interaction between herbivores and vegetation, their predominant food source. Understanding this interaction is crucial to providing information that is useful for conservation of herbivores. The objective of this study was to determine how sward height influences functional response and movement patterns of free ranging wild impala and zebra at the Kenya Wildlife Service Training Institute. The study was conducted for 3 months. Sward height is an important parameter that indicates how intensive a sward has been grazed and it influences intake rate through its effect on bite size. Bite size, instantaneous intake rate, specific mass intake rate and <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> interval <b>for</b> impala and zebra increased with sward height. Sward height in combination with an animal's sex was found to have a profound effect on specific mass intake rate in impala. Zebra had a longer <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> interval and lower stepping rate in tall swards compared to impala. Despite differences in their specific body mass and digestive strategies, impala and zebra maximized their intake rates in tall swards as a trade-off among the swards. Tall swards are therefore critical in the study area and should be protected from bush encroachment which is a persistent problem. 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R

Four of the bearded vulture cases were positive for the presence of topical antiparasitics (3 with diazinon and 1 with permethrin). These likely represented accidental exposure due to the legal use of these veterinary pharmaceuticals. In order to confirm the risk of exposure to topical antiparasitics in bearded vultures, pig feet (n = 24) and lamb feet (n = 24) were analysed as these are one of the main food resources provided to bearded vultures at supplementary <b>feeding</b> <b>stations.</b> Pig feet had no detectable residues of topical antiparasitics. In contrast, 71. 4 % of lamb feet showed residues of antiparasitics including diazinon (64. 3 %), pirimiphos-methyl (25. 4 %), chlorpyrifos (7. 1 %), fenthion (1. 6 %), permethrin (0. 8 %) and cypermethrin (27. 8 %). Washing the feet with water significantly reduced levels of these topical antiparasitics, as such, this should be a recommended practice for lamb feet supplied at <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> <b>for</b> bearded vultures. Although the detected levels of antiparasitics were relatively low (≤ 1 μg/g), a risk assessment suggests that observed diazinon levels may affect brain acetylcholinesterase and thermoregulation in bearded vultures subject to chronic exposure. This study was funded by a grant of the Spanish Program of Research and Development (CGL 2013 - 40975 -R) and a contract with the Biodiversity Service of the Gobierno de Aragón (RB 82125, RB 29049, RB 044077, RB 14087, RB 24105, RB 34047, RB 44050, RB 54098). The Generalitat de Catalunya (Ref. 060469060004), Gobierno de Navarra and Diputación Foral de Álava also collaborated with the sampling and funding. The Fundación para la Conservación del Quebrantahuesos (Bearded Vulture Conservation Foundation) is especially acknowledged for their important collaboration. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
