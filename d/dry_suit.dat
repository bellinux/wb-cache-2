5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. As divers are seldom weighted to be very negatively buoyant, a positive buoyancy of 50kg is considered adequate by some authorities for general commercial use. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy ay their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or <b>dry</b> <b>suit,</b> but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack.|$|E

Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack. The diver ascends along the shotline, and may use it purely as a visual reference, or can hold on to it to positively control depth, or can climb up it hand over hand. A Jonline may be used to fasten a diver to a shotline during a decompression stop.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>suits</b> for {{recreational}} diving {{are made in}} both membrane and neoprene, and primarily differ from surface <b>dry</b> <b>suits</b> in that they have inflation and deflation air valves to maintain neutral buoyancy, and may be slightly more durable.|$|R
2500|$|The main {{difference}} between <b>dry</b> <b>suits</b> and wetsuits is that <b>dry</b> <b>suits</b> {{are designed to}} prevent water entering. This generally allows better insulation making them more suitable for use in cold water. <b>Dry</b> <b>suits</b> can be uncomfortably hot in warm or hot air, and are typically more expensive and more complex to don. For divers, they add some degree of operational complexity as the suit must be inflated and deflated with changes in depth {{in order to minimize}} [...] "squeeze" [...] on descent or uncontrolled rapid ascent due to excessive buoyancy.|$|R
25|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>suits</b> {{are often}} worn for boating, {{especially}} sailing, and on personal water craft {{in the winter}} months. The primary uses are for protection from spray, and in case of accidental short-term immersion in cold water if the user falls overboard. These <b>dry</b> <b>suits,</b> which are only intended for temporary immersion, are less rugged than diving <b>dry</b> <b>suits.</b> They are usually made of a breathable membrane material to let sweat permeate, keeping the wearer dry and comfortable all day. Membrane type surface <b>dry</b> <b>suits</b> only keep the user dry, and have little thermal insulating properties. Most users will wear a thin thermal undersuit, or street clothes, for warmth; but wearing ordinary fabrics can be dangerous if the suit leaks in cold water because they will lose most of their insulating properties.|$|R
25|$|Surface <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> {{users can}} face a similar {{inversion}} problem. The problem is more acute when {{not wearing a}} personal flotation device (life vest) over the <b>dry</b> <b>suit.</b> For surface <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> users, the inversion can be much more critical if no one is nearby to assist, since the wearer may be held upside down and unable to breathe, and may also have water run down into their nose while inverted.|$|E
25|$|A <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> {{functions}} {{by keeping}} the diver dry. The suit is waterproof and sealed so that water cannot penetrate the suit. Special purpose undergarments are usually worn under a <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> to keep a layer of air between the diver and the suit for thermal insulation. Some divers carry an extra gas bottle dedicated to filling the <b>dry</b> <b>suit,</b> which may contain argon gas, {{because it is a}} better insulator than air. Dry suits should not be inflated with gases containing helium as it is a good thermal conductor.|$|E

25|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>suit</b> squeeze. The {{main risk}} is skin getting pinched and bruised by {{folds of the}} <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> when {{squeezed}} on descent. Most dry suits can be equalised against squeeze via a manually operated valve fed from a low pressure gas supply. Air must be manually injected during the descent to avoid squeeze and is manually or automatically vented on the ascent to maintain buoyancy control.|$|E

25|$|A <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> or drysuit {{provides}} the wearer with environmental protection {{by way of}} thermal insulation and exclusion of water, and is worn by divers, boaters, water sports enthusiasts, and others who work or play in or near cold or contaminated water. A <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> normally protects the whole body except the head, hands, and possibly the feet. In hazmat configurations, however, {{all of these are}} covered as well.|$|E

25|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>suits</b> provide passive thermal protection: They {{insulate}} against {{heat transfer}} to the environment. When this is insufficient, active warming or cooling may be provided, usually by a hot-water suit, which is a wetsuit with a supply of heated or chilled water from the surface, {{but it is also}} possible to provide chemical or electrically powered heating accessories to <b>dry</b> <b>suits.</b>|$|R
25|$|The BCD is {{designed}} {{to act as a}} flotation device on the surface, the <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> is not.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for the <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> or BCD inflation valve to freeze while inflating, for similar reasons to regulator freeze. If this happens it can cause a runaway ascent {{if it is not}} dealt with immediately. If possible the low pressure inflator hose should be disconnected before it freezes onto the valve, while dumping air to control buoyancy. Excessive dumping of air may leave the diver too negative so it is preferable to have at least two controllable buoyancy systems, such as a <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> and BCD, preferably supplied from different first stages. If the <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> inflation valve freezes open it may allow water to leak into the suit once disconnected, so this usually results in aborting the dive.|$|E
25|$|Reasonable {{care must}} be taken not to {{puncture}} or tear membrane dry suits, because buoyancy and insulation depend entirely on the air space in the undersuit, (whereas a wetsuit normally allows water to enter, and retains its insulation despite it). The <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> material offers essentially no buoyancy or insulation itself, so if the <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> leaks or is torn, water can soak the undersuit, with a corresponding loss of buoyancy and insulation.|$|E

25|$|To {{provide more}} {{protection}} {{to the head}} against impact, to secure the airway, and to permit easy communication with the surface and between divers, a rigid metal or fibre-reinforced plastic diving helmet may be worn with the <b>dry</b> <b>suit.</b> This can be separate from the <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> with its own watertight neck seal, {{or it can be}} clamped onto a neck ring attached to the suit, so that air can flow between the helmet and the suit.|$|E
25|$|Some {{consider}} a <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> mandatory; however, a thick wetsuit may be sufficient for hardier divers. A wetsuit can be pre-heated by pouring warm {{water into the}} suit. A hood and gloves (recommended three-finger mitts or dry gloves with rings) are necessary, and <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> divers {{have the option of}} using hoods and gloves that keep their head and hands dry. Some prefer to use a full face diving mask to essentially eliminate any contact with the cold water.|$|E
25|$|The {{certified}} scuba diver {{is expected}} to be able to assess what type of diving exposure suit is suitable for the planned dive, and to check that it is in safe usable condition, that it is the right size, and to dress correctly in it. Entry level skills usually cover wet suits, but in countries where the water and/or weather conditions are very cold, <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> skills may be considered an entry level skill. In other parts of the world, <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> skills are considered a specialty skill. Where dry suits are used, the skills of using the <b>dry</b> <b>suit</b> safely during a dive are also necessary. These include equalizing, buoyancy control, inversion recovery, emergency venting and blowup recovery. Recreational divers trained in warm tropical waters may have no skills in the use of diving suits.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>suits</b> {{are also}} worn by rescue {{personnel}} who must enter, or may accidentally enter, cold water. Features of <b>dry</b> <b>suits</b> designed for rescue {{may be a}} hybrid of the immersion survival and work suits, since the wearer {{is not expected to}} be working in the suit for an extended time. They may also be optimized for a specific task such as ice rescue, or helicopter rescue swimmer.|$|R
