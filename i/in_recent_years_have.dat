5|$|Postwar {{assessments}} of the Home Army's activities in Lithuania have been controversial. In 1993, the Home Army's activities there were investigated by a special Lithuanian government commission.

5|$|The most talked-about {{applications}} {{of these models}} <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>have</b> been their use to infer the consequences of increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide (see greenhouse gas). These models predict an upward trend in the global mean surface temperature, with the most rapid increase in temperature being projected for the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} factors, {{including}} the bizarre facts and Cardozo's outstanding reputation, {{made the case}} prominent in the legal profession, and it remains so, taught to {{most if not all}} American law students in torts class. Cardozo's conception, that tort liability only occurs when a defendant breaches a duty of care the defendant owes to a plaintiff, causing the injury sued for, has been widely accepted in American law. In dealing with proximate cause, many states have taken the approach championed by the Court of Appeals' dissenter in Palsgraf, Judge William S. Andrews. Some legal scholars <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>have</b> criticized Cardozo for not taking into account Palsgraf's impoverished circumstances.|$|E
5|$|One of these, The Talk of the Town, was {{the first}} three-time World Grand Champion. Midnight Sun was also great-grandsire of I Am Jose, the second three-time winner. Most of the leading Tennessee Walker sires <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>have</b> {{themselves}} been descendants of Midnight Sun. Midnight Sun sired approximately 2,600 foals in his lifetime, and during his stud career earned his owners close to $100,000 a year, mostly through the then-new use of artificial insemination (AI). Through his offspring, he has also influenced the Racking Horse and Spotted Saddle Horse breeds. For many years, a life-size statue of Midnight Sun, commissioned after his death by his former owner Geraldine Livingston, stood at the TWHBEA headquarters in Lewisburg, Tennessee.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditionally}} low {{wage differential}} {{has increased in}} recent years as a result of increased flexibility as the role of wage setting at the company level has strengthened somewhat. Still, Swedish unskilled employees are well paid while well educated Swedish employees are low-paid compared with those in competitor countries in Western Europe and the US. The average increases in real wages <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>have</b> been high by historical standards, in large part due to unforeseen price stability. Even so, nominal wages <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>have</b> been slightly above those in competitor countries. Thus, while private-sector wages rose by an average annual rate of 3.75% from 1998 to 2000 in Sweden, the comparable increase for the EU area was 1.75%. In the year 2000 the total labour force was around 4.4 million people.|$|E

25|$|Genetic studies <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>have</b> {{indicated}} snakes are not {{as closely}} related to monitor lizards as was once believed—and therefore not to mosasaurs, the proposed ancestor in the aquatic scenario of their evolution. However, more evidence links mosasaurs to snakes than to varanids. Fragmented remains found from the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous indicate deeper fossil records for these groups, which may potentially refute either hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Batteries are an {{important}} component of diesel-electric submarines, allowing them to operate underwater for extended periods of time before having to resurface to recharge them. Improvements in battery technology <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>have</b> allowed smaller diesel-electric submarines to operate with greatly improved range and endurance. Future submarine designs might use improvements in Lithium-ion battery technology. The Collins-class replacement might operate battery technology superior to that of the existing Collins-class.|$|E

25|$|Many {{types of}} sports {{equipment}} {{are made of}} wood, or were constructed of wood in the past. For example, cricket bats are typically made of white willow. The baseball bats which are legal for use in Major League Baseball are frequently made of ash wood or hickory, and <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>have</b> been constructed from maple even though that wood is somewhat more fragile.

25|$|Many historians <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>have</b> sought {{alternatives}} to national histories, and Ukrainian history invited approaches that looked beyond a national paradigm. Multiethnic history recognises the numerous peoples in Ukraine; transnational history portrays Ukraine as a border zone for various empires; and area studies categorises Ukraine {{as part of}} Eurasia, or more often as part of East-Central Europe. Plokhy (2007) argues that looking beyond the country's national history has made possible a richer understanding of Ukraine, its people, and the surrounding regions.|$|E
25|$|O gauge had {{its heyday}} when model railroads were {{considered}} toys, with more {{emphasis placed on}} cost, durability, {{and the ability to}} be easily handled and operated by pre-adult hands. Detail and realism were secondary concerns, at best. It still remains a popular choice for those hobbyists who enjoy running trains more than they enjoy other aspects of modeling, but developments <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>have</b> addressed the concerns of scale model railroaders making O scale popular among fine-scale modellers who value the detail that can be achieved.|$|E
