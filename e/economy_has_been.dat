Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health, and private enterprise, are key elements of Madagascar's development strategy. Under Ravalomanana, these investments produced substantial economic growth, but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population, producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the middle class. , the <b>economy</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> weakened by the 2009–2013 political crisis, and quality of life remains low {{for the majority of the}} Malagasy population.|$|E

A little over a quarter of the workforce serves the Falkland Islands government, making it the archipelago's largest employer. Tourism, part of the service <b>economy,</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> spurred by increased interest in Antarctic exploration and the creation of direct air links with the United Kingdom and South America.

The islands' major exports include wool, hides, venison, fish and squid; its main imports include fuel, building materials and clothing.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Australia's {{economic}} strength {{relative to the}} rest of the world was reflected in its GDP. In 1870, Australia had the highest GDP per capita in the world due to economic growth fuelled by its natural resources. However, as Australia's population grew rapidly over the 20th century, its GDP per capita dropped relative to countries such as the US and Norway. However, the Australian <b>economy</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> performing nominally better than other economies of the OECD and has supported economic growth for over 20 consecutive years. According to the Reserve Bank of Australia, Australian per capita GDP growth is higher than that of New Zealand, US, Canada and The Netherlands.

More than 200 international and domestic enterprises moved into the state, allowing for the development of modern infrastructure such as highways, ports and airports, making the state one of the best connected in the country. A bridge was built over the Colorado River to link Sonora with neighboring Baja California in 1964.
