Four modes of governance {{and a range of}} policy instruments were examined in the delivery of sustainable London Olympics sport legacy including coercive, voluntarism, targeting and <b>framework</b> <b>regulation.</b> The British government actively created a new policy space and promoted institutional conduct consistent with its legacy visions.

40|$|Telecommunications is a {{key element}} of the ICT sector which has been shaped by strong {{innovation}} dynamics since the 1990 s. Market dynamics in OECD telecommunications markets are analyzed. We present new ideas about efficient regulation, emphasizing the need to adopt a broader international perspective. Analytical innovations also include the discussion of an adequately-modified Hitch-Sweezy oligopoly model. Moreover, we suggest differentiated two-part tariffs as an ideal welfare-maximizing approach in both wholesale and end-product markets. From a theoretical point-of-view, the need to avoid regulatory uncertainty is also emphasized. Theoretical progress is contrasted with regulations in the EU and the US. The EU offers a broad range of different regulatory approaches where the link between <b>framework</b> <b>regulation</b> and national regulation is rather complex. The internationalization of telecommunications requires a broader cooperation among regulators in the OECD. Competition, Telecommunications, EU Integration, FCC, Regulation...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} enjoy {{credibility}} and acceptance among those involved, harmonization {{must be the}} outcome of a deliberative process with a defined goal, but without a predetermined solution.

The TRIPS Agreement tells a different story. Countries have learned to live with it, but nobody is entirely happy. In order to make international law more inclusive and responsive to different socio-economic conditions and needs, the TRIPS Agreement needs to be reconceptualized as a market <b>framework</b> <b>regulation</b> that promotes competition and innovation but also allows states to regulate the use of intellectual property in ways that grow out of, and comply with, their own traditions and interests.

40|$|Protection of {{innovative}} technologies by patents or by copyrights {{is marked by}} a tension between, on the one hand, the private interest in obtaining a broad exclusivity over market opportunities, and, on the other, the public interest in strictly limiting the "monopoly" right to what is necessary for it to serve as an incentive for innovation. Frequently the argument goes that instances of "over-protection" may be remedied by – possibly enhanced – enforcement of competition law. However, while intellectual property protection forms part of the <b>framework</b> <b>regulation</b> of competition driven dynamic markets, competition law alone will not contain excessive protection but at the margin. A dysfunctional operation of the system of protection typically results from a mismatch between the purpose, which it is supposed to serve, {{and the way in which}} the property rights are interpreted and/or used, which are made available to market actors to meet such purpose. There is, therefore, a need to adequately bind the property logic, which informs the system of protection in practice, to its underlying policy. Binding the protection of exclusive rights over technology to its purpose is warranted, because innovative knowledge is not a subject matter of property rights like any other. Rather, it is transformed from a public good into a private right of property by specific legislative design. Whether bound tightly or loosely to its purpose, whether defined broadly or narrowly, there is thus a political content to the protection of technological property. It so is even if the legislator or the courts decide to put the emphasis on the property logic rather than on the purpose of protection. The nature and intensity of this political content necessarily varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction as, indeed, it will and must be defined in accordance with the needs of an economy and the goals of a polity. For the European Union this means that to the extent it sets for itself the objectives of technological property protection, it also ought to determine itself the terms of the system and to control itself its operation. After all, the conditions and criteria of technology protection constitute part of the <b>framework</b> <b>regulation</b> of the Internal Market as a market for innovation...|$|E
40|$|Petitioners for {{exemptions}} from EPA's prohibitions {{on underground}} injection {{of hazardous waste}} must demonstrate that waste constituents will not migrate from the injection zone at "hazardous level^. ^ '- See 40 CFR § 148. 20 (a).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is limited to {{defining}} the differences of the functions and of the operation of compulsory licences, which typically are available under patent law, on one hand, or, on the other, are imposed {{as a matter of}} enforcing the antitrust laws. The thesis of this contribution is that each of patent law’s compulsory licensing rules does (and ought to) follow its own distinct rationale. Their common denominator is that they are specific to the systematic operation of patent protection as an incentive mechanism for innovation. By contrast, competition law constitutes part of the <b>framework</b> <b>regulation</b> of the market. Where its application results in imposing licensing obligations on patentees, it does so in order to correct an unjustified restriction of competition. This remedial function of antitrust-related licensing obligations is complementary to but different from patent law’s rules on compulsory licensing. The different functions of system-supportive or system-intrinsic mandatory licensing rules and competition-related obligations also mean that before introducing new or broadening existing provisions on compulsory licences a proper diagnosis has to be made of the ill that they are supposed to cure...|$|E
