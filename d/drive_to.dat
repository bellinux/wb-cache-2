3000|$|Under the {{assumption}} αβ <δ_ 2 ([...] β +δ_ 1), it follows from Lemma  2.1 {{that the first}} species will be <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> extinction. Obviously, if db_ 2 /a_ 2 is small enough, then inequality (3.1) holds. Moreover, it follows from Theorem  3.1 that A_ 2 (0, 0,b_ 2 /a _ 2) is globally asymptotically stable, {{which means that the}} first species is still <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> extinction. That is, if the cooperation is limited, then, despite the cooperation between the two species, the species is still <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> extinction.|$|R
5|$|Lethbridge is {{near the}} Lethbridge Airport and the CPR rail yards in Kipp, Alberta. The airport {{provides}} commercial flights to Calgary and Edmonton, as well as private and charter flights elsewhere. The airport provides customs services for flights arriving from the United States. The rail yards were moved to Kipp, {{just west of the}} city, from downtown Lethbridge in 1983. The yards were planned for redevelopment with a mix of multi-family residential, commercial and light industrial land uses. The Park Place Mall is now located on the portion of the former rail yards north of 1Avenue South between Scenic <b>Drive</b> <b>to</b> the west and Stafford <b>Drive</b> <b>to</b> the east.|$|E

5|$|The MTO {{formally}} {{announced plans}} to alleviate traffic in Newmarket on 28 August 2000: a three contract project to widen and extend Highway404. The first contract added an additional lane in each direction in the grass median from Major Mackenzie <b>Drive</b> <b>to</b> Bloomington Road. A second contract then extended those two lanes north to Aurora Sideroad. These two projects both began {{in the summer of}} 2001 and were completed in December. The third contract called for a four lane extension from Davis <b>Drive</b> <b>to</b> Green Lane and the reconstruction of Green Lane into a four-laned arterial road between Leslie Street and Woodbine Avenue.|$|E

5|$|A {{landscaped}} {{park with}} lakes and statues {{was laid out}} around the house, and the <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the house was along a semicircular avenue of trees. Sir Edward died in 1766.

This proved impossible so in 1768 he had the entire house demolished.|$|E

5|$|Drives which encrypt all {{writes on}} the fly can {{implement}} ATA Secure Erase in another way. They simply zeroize and generate a new random encryption key each time a secure erase is done.

5|$|Forty {{tanks of}} the 1st Brigade {{were to be}} used in the attack on the Third Army front, eight with XVIII Corps and sixteen each in VII Corps and VI Corps. When the blue line had been reached, four of the VII Corps tanks were to join VI Corps for its attack on the brown line. The black line (first objective) was not to be {{attacked}} by tanks, which were to begin the <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the front line at zero-hour and rendezvous with infantry at the black line two hours later. The tanks were reserved for the most difficult objectives beyond the black line in groups of up to ten vehicles. Four tanks were to attack Neuville Vitasse, four against Telegraph Hill, four against The Harp and another four against Tilloy lez Mofflaines and two were to drive down the slope from Roclincourt west of Bois de la Maison Blanche. Once the blue line had fallen, the tanks still running were to <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> rally points.|$|E
