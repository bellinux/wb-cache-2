5|$|During {{the evening}} of 19 November, a {{thunderstorm}} followed by a drenching downpour broke over the opposing armies. In a few hours every wadi in the foothills and on the plain was in flood. The black soil plain, hard and firm during summer, became in these winter conditions sticky and heavy for marching and almost impassable for wheeled vehicles. The temperature, which had been hot {{during the day and}} pleasant at night, dropped rapidly to become piercingly cold. The infantrymen had been marching light in their summer uniform of twill shorts and tunics. With only one blanket (and/or a <b>Greatcoat),</b> this gear gave little protection from the driving rain and bitter chill.|$|E
5|$|The Balkan Wars {{had only}} just {{concluded}} and Serbia was still recovering. Over 36,000 Serbian soldiers had been killed and 55,000 seriously wounded. Few recruits had been gained from the newly acquired territories, and the Serbian Army had been stretched {{by the need to}} garrison them against Albanian insurgents and the threat of Bulgarian attack. To compound matters, the Serbs were dangerously short of artillery, and {{had only just}} begun to replenish their ammunition stocks. Their supply problems also extended to more basic items. Many soldiers lacked any uniform other than a standard issue <b>greatcoat</b> and a traditional Serbian cap known as a šajkača. Rifles were also in critically short supply. It was estimated that full mobilization would see some 50,000 Serbian soldiers with no equipment at all. The Austro-Hungarians, on the other hand, possessed an abundance of modern rifles and had twice as many machine guns and field guns as the Serbs. They also had better stocks of munitions, as well as much better transport and industrial infrastructure behind them. The Serbs had a slight advantage over the Austro-Hungarians as many of their soldiers were experienced veterans of the Balkan Wars and better trained than their Austro-Hungarian counterparts. Serb soldiers were also highly motivated, which compensated in part for their lack of weaponry.|$|E
5|$|Fighting in Eastern Europe {{began with}} the first Austro-Hungarian {{invasion}} of Serbia in early August 1914. The number of Austro-Hungarian troops was far smaller than the 308,000-strong force intended when war was declared. This was because {{a large portion of}} the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army had moved to the Russian Front, reducing the number of troops involved in the initial stages of the invasion to approximately 200,000. Forty percent of this force was composed of South Slavs living within Austro-Hungarian borders. On the other hand, the Serbs could muster some 450,000 men to oppose the Austro-Hungarians upon full mobilization. The main elements to face the Austro-Hungarians were the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and Užice Armies, with a combined strength of approximately 180,000 men. The Balkan Wars had only just concluded and Serbia was still recovering. Over 36,000 Serbian soldiers had been killed and 55,000 seriously wounded. Few recruits had been gained from the newly acquired territories, and the Serbian army had been stretched by the need to garrison them against Albanian insurgents and the threat of Bulgarian attack. To compound matters, the Serbian army was dangerously short of artillery, and had only just begun to replenish its ammunition stocks. Its supply problems also extended to more basic items. Many Serbian recruits reported for duty barefoot, and many units lacked any uniform other than a standard issue <b>greatcoat</b> and a traditional Serbian cap known as a šajkača. Rifles were also in critically short supply. It was estimated that full mobilization would see some 50,000 Serbian soldiers with no equipment at all.

25|$|Parade uniform (Paradeuniform) – The parade uniform for {{officers}} was the semi-dress/walking-out tunic {{with all}} authorized orders, awards and decorations attached, breeches and riding boots, steel helmet, white shirt, dark-gray necktie, and a ceremonial dagger worn {{on the left}} side and fastened to a silver-gray parade belt.

25|$|Service uniform (Dienstuniform) – The summer service uniform for {{officers}} was a bloused jacket, {{called a}} Hemdbluse, worn without a shirt, trousers, and a visored service cap. The winter service uniform featured a tunic with four large buttoned-down patch pockets, a black waist belt, the service cap, breeches, shirt, tie, and pants belt; high boots were reserved for officers and NCOs. A long, heavy, belted <b>greatcoat</b> was {{also part of}} the winter uniform.|$|E
25|$|When marching {{into war}} a soldier would have worn the {{traditional}} redcoat uniform {{consisting of the}} distinctive regimental coat, a white shirt, grey trousers to be held up {{by a pair of}} braces, shoes and a cap. The cap may have differed depending on the regiment, but a traditional pattern was the Tricorne to be replaced by the Stovepipe Shako. This too would be replaced in the majority of regiments by the widespread use of the Belgic shako by 1812, as displayed by the 33rd Regiment of Foot. A <b>greatcoat,</b> fashioned in grey wool, would be worn and was normally tied on top of the haversack or knapsack which was carried by the men whilst on the move.|$|E
25|$|These camps {{were often}} located in regions where the climate or the terrain made life difficult, but also near the front, where the prisoners {{might be taken}} to rebuild {{trenches}} or cart away bodies. The goal of the reprisal camps was {{to put pressure on}} enemy governments to ameliorate conditions of detention for German prisoners, and to punish prisoners (for instance following an escape). Life for prisoners sent to reprisal camps was so harsh that many of them died. Robert d'Harcourt describes the arrival of a prisoners’ convoy coming from such a camp: “These men – these soldiers – marched, but they were dead; beneath each blue <b>greatcoat</b> was the head of a dead man: their eyes hollow, their cheekbones jutting out, their emaciated grimaces those of graveyard skulls”. Often kept in tents resting in mud, these prisoners were forced into exhaustive work with their entire diet consisting of soup or perhaps stewed acorns. At certain camps, for instance at Sedan, some prisoners were executed. Reprisal camps for officers existed, too: the fortress at Ingolstadt held Charles de Gaulle, Georges Catroux, Roland Garros, the journalist and World War II Resistance member Rémy Roure, the editor Berger-Levrault and the future Soviet Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky.|$|E

25|$|Officers were {{responsible}} for providing (and paying for) their own uniforms. Consequently, variable styles and decorations were present, according to the officer's private means. Officers in the Infantry wore scarlet coattees with long tails fastened with turnbacks. Close-fitting white pantaloons, tucked into tall Hessian or riding boots were worn, often covered with grey wool and leather overalls on campaign, {{in addition to a}} dark blue, later grey, double-breasted <b>greatcoat.</b> After 1811, officers were permitted to wear a short tailed coatee, grey pantaloons or trousers and low field boots on campaign. Officers generally wore silver or gold epaulettes (depending on regimental colours), with regimental badge to designate rank. An 1810 order stipulated that subalterns wore one epaulette, on the right shoulder, while captains wore one of a more ornate pattern on the right shoulder. Field officers wore one on each shoulder, badged with a star (for majors), a crown (lieutenant colonels) or star and crown (colonels). Grenadier, fusilier and light infantry officers wore more ornate versions of the shoulder wings their men wore on both shoulders; trimmed with lace, chain or bullion. Generals, from 1812, wore an aiguillette over the right shoulder, and rank was denoted by the spacing of buttons on the coatee: Major generals wore their buttons in pairs, lieutenant generals in threes and full generals wore their buttons singly spaced.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} episode of series three of Ashes to Ashes, {{the nature of his}} death is raised when Alex Drake discovers a witness {{statement}} implied to have been written by Gene Hunt with various parts blacked out, accompanied by Alex seeing visions of a man with injuries to {{the left side of his}} face dressed in police tunic and <b>greatcoat.</b> In the second episode, DCI Jim Keats, an officer from the Discipline and Complaints department, intent on removing Gene Hunt, states he believes Gene killed Sam Tyler. In the fifth episode, Gene destroys Tyler's clothes (which Alex had requested from Manchester) and the censored file in order to prevent her from learning the truth about his death. In the following episode, a suspect who is not only a known fantasist but appears very different physically from Sam tries to convince Alex that he is Sam Tyler after undergoing extensive plastic surgery, and that he is from the future. He quotes Sam's usual speech in the Life on Mars introductions, claiming that nobody else is real, although he still seems to be pleased when he, Gene and Alex are in the same room, calling them the 'Three Musketeers', and avoiding Alex's attempts to test him for future knowledge by claiming that such details are forgotten after too long in the past. Gene tells Alex that he helped Sam fake his own death, meaning Sam was still alive but had disappeared into thin air.|$|E
500|$|During Jack's initial {{appearances}} in Doctor Who, Russell T Davies held a [...] "half-hearted" [...] theory that Jack would dress {{specific to the}} time period he was in, to contrast the Doctor who dresses the same wherever and whenever he goes. He is introduced wearing a <b>greatcoat</b> in World War II-set episodes, but changes to modern day jeans in contemporary episode [...] "Boom Town" [...] and black leather in futuristic episodes. Davies admits {{that this was a}} [...] "bit of a lame idea" [...] and decided that Jack [...] "never looked better than {{when he was in his}} World War II outfit". [...] From the pilot of Torchwood onwards, Harkness once again wears period military clothes from the second World War, including braces and an officer's wool <b>greatcoat</b> in every appearance. Costume designer Ray Holman commented in a Torchwood Magazine interview that [...] "We always wanted to keep the World War Two hero look for him, so all his outfits have a 1940s flavour." [...] Because the character was expected to [...] "be running around a lot", Holman redesigned his RAF Group Captain's <b>greatcoat</b> from Doctor Who to make it more fluid and less [...] "weighty". Jack's other costumes are [...] "loosely wartime based", such as the trousers are [...] "getting more and more styled to suit his figure". Holman explains that there are actually five Captain Jack coats used on the show. The [...] "hero version" [...] is used for most scenes, while there is also a wetcoat made with pre-shrunk fabric, running coat which is slightly shorter to prevent heels getting caught, and two [...] "stunt coats" [...] that had been [...] "hero coats" [...] in the first series." [...] Davies feels the military uniform reinforces the idea that the character [...] "likes his Captain Jack Harkness identity". Julie Gardner describes the coat as [...] "epic and classic and dramatic", while director Brian Kelly believes it gives Jack [...] "a sweep and a presence".|$|E

500|$|Initially, Browning {{joined the}} 4th Battalion, Grenadier Guards, which was {{training}} at Bovington Camp. When it departed for the Western Front in August 1915, he {{was transferred to}} the 5th (Reserve) Battalion. In October 1915 he left to join the 2nd Battalion at the front. The battalion formed part of the 1st Guards Brigade of the Guards Division. Around this time he acquired the nickname [...] "Boy". For a time he served in the same company of 2nd Battalion as Major Winston Churchill. Upon Churchill's arrival, Browning was given the job of showing him the company's trenches. When Browning discovered that Churchill had no <b>greatcoat,</b> Browning gave Churchill his own. Browning was invalided back to England with trench fever in January 1916, and, although only hospitalised for four weeks, did not rejoin the 2nd Battalion at the front until 6 October 1916.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{confirmed}} on The Howard Stern Show {{that she}} would be filming a music video for the song in Los Angeles. Directed by Jonas Åkerlund, who had previously helmed Madonna's music videos for [...] "Ray of Light", [...] "Music", [...] "American Life", [...] "Jump" [...] and [...] "Celebration", the music video also starred actor Terrence Howard. The main theme behind the video was [...] "an apocalyptic situation mimicking the end of the world", as described by Kim Peiffer from InStyle. The director came up with the concept of a dystopian future and shot it at an old steel mill. Madonna's look in the video was styled by B. Åkerlund, wife of Jonas, who blended contemporary fashion trends like military-bandleader-Victorian and gave it her signature characteristics. She created a leather <b>greatcoat</b> with a billowing cape, from designer label Chrome Hearts, considering the rock-n-roll silhouette of the video.|$|E
500|$|While in {{his first}} several Doctor Who appearances, Jack {{did not have a}} set costume, Torchwood {{established}} a continual look for Jack which recalled that of his first Doctor Who appearance. The design has been described as [...] "an iconic piece of sci-fi culture". A writer for Wired attributes much of Jack's appeal to the coat: [...] "I think it has lots to do with that coat he always wears. Coats are cool, just like fezzes and bow ties and Stetsons. The only difference is that Captain Jack doesn't ever tell you his coat is cool. It just is." [...] In fact, in her essay [...] "Fashioning Masculinity and Desire", Sarah Gilligan attributes Torchwoods popularity—as well as that of the character—to the costume. She credits the <b>greatcoat</b> with helping to fashion the character's masculinity, and argues that Jack's costume creates its own discourse [...] "through which costume drama and Post Heritage cinema's escapism flows".|$|E

50|$|In 1912, Detaille {{created new}} uniforms for the French army. They were never {{adopted by the}} Minister of War, but the blue-gray <b>greatcoats</b> would {{influence}} later French World War I uniforms, and the Adrian helmet was heavily influenced by his designs.|$|R
500|$|For Miracle Day, Davies {{commissioned}} new {{costume designer}} Shawna Trpcic (previously costume designer for Angel, Firefly and Dollhouse) {{to create a}} new <b>greatcoat</b> design. This was partially motivated by Los Angeles' warmer climate; shooting in Wales had necessitated Barrowman be fit in much warmer clothing. The new coat is custom made by Italian designers, and is actually cashmere-blend wool where the previous one had been cotton. Trpcic says that she [...] "just wanted to modernise it, give it a more modern fit, but leave the drape and keep it cape-like". Trpcic felt prepared for the job of redesigning the coat because of her prior work on Firefly, tailoring for Nathan Fillion's Captain Malcolm Reynolds: [...] "I'm kind of used to iconic captain's coats and the importance of staying loyal to what the fans expect and to what we need". Journalist Maureen Ryan commented that the new coat is [...] "greatly improved" [...] and the redesign [...] "gives the coat the kind of movement and swagger Jack brings with him on every adventure".|$|E

500|$|Out of {{gratitude}} to God for giving him salvation, Jenner committed to consistently engaging in personal evangelism, and aimed {{to talk with}} ten different people every day thenceforward. For 28 years, from his initial conversion until his debility from Parkinson's disease, Jenner engaged in this form of evangelism. He probably spoke with more than 100,000 people in total, hundreds of whom made initial professions of commitment to Christianity. He kept religious tracts in his shirt pocket where he had previously kept his rabbit's foot, and he often gave these tracts to people he met. He also kept a card in his pocket with Philippians 4:13 on {{it in order to}} give himself courage in evangelising. This verse reads, [...] "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." [...] While engaging in these activities, Jenner would normally wear a white shirt, black shoes, and trousers, and sometimes a navy <b>greatcoat.</b> Usually evangelising on George Street, Sydney, Jenner asked many people the same question: [...] "If you died within 24 hours, where would you be in eternity? Heaven or hell?" [...] If they were willing to engage in conversation with him, he would invite them either to his home or to a local church. The question became known as [...] "the Frank Jenner question". Jenner was most active in evangelism during World War II. On Saturday nights during the war, Jenner would invite groups of sailors to his home for a service consisting of some hymns and a short sermon.|$|E
