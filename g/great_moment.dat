The band parted ways with Oldham during the sessions. The split was amicable, at least publicly, but in 2003 Jagger said: [...] "The reason Andrew left was because he thought that we weren't concentrating {{and that we were}} being childish.

He highlighted the cliffhanger of the scene—when the Doctor realises that Donna met Rose, and subsequently deduces the universe is in danger—as the best moment in the episode; he wrote that it was [...] "a <b>great</b> <b>moment,</b> and sets up a premise suitably large for Davies' farewell episodes." [...] He criticised two major points of the episode: he thought the beetle prosthetic did not look convincing, and undermined Donna's questions of why people were looking at her back; and he thought the episode was Davies' highlight reel, reminiscent of someone reminding the viewer of an event and then moving to the next slide.

Fickett, when discussing the latter, singled out the moment wherein Michael hurts Phyllis' feelings by telling her she can't play basketball, writing, [...] "The moment is played mostly straight–and it does feel more realistic and uncomfortable and in that way, the show leans more towards the feel of the UK series. It's a <b>great</b> <b>moment,</b> but feels like a different show." [...] Overall, he wrote that, [...] "There is still quite a bit of funny stuff , but in many ways, this episode suggests what the show would have been like had it taken a slightly different direction in terms of tone and style."
