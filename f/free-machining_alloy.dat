40|$|Titanium alloys {{are widely}} used in the {{aerospace}} and power generation industries due to their high specific strength and corrosion resistance. Titanium alloys like the modern (α+β) Titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 2 Sn 4 Zr 6 Mo (Ti- 6246) are difficult to machine due {{to the formation of}} long chips which hinders automated manufacturing. In the present study, Lanthanum has been added to Ti- 6246 alloy to improve its machinability, i. e. to reduce the chips’ length. As Lanthanum and Tin form La 5 Sn 3 intermetallic phase, the 2 % of Tin had to be replaced by 3 % of Zirconium. The matrix of Ti 6 Al 7 Zr 6 Mo with Lanthanum contains pure metallic Lanthanum precipitates which have a relatively low melting point compared to Titanium. Besides the standard alloy Ti- 6246 two modifiedalloys, namely, Ti 6 Al 7 Zr 6 Mo 0. 9 La and Ti 6 Al 7 Zr 6 Mo 0. 5 La were investigated. During machining of these new <b>free-machining</b> <b>alloy</b> short and strongly segmented chips are observed enabling automation of machining operations. This can be explained by softening of Lanthanum particles during segmented chip formation. The microstructure, phase composition and the deformability of the new free-machining alloys were analysed after different thermo-mechanical treatments. In addition, the mechanical properties of the modified alloys are investigated which are similar compared to the standard alloy...|$|E

It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining. The shrinking on solidification in lead {{and the expansion of}} bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material.|$|R
