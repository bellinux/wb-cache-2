5|$|Bach {{composed}} this cantata for Whit Tuesday, {{the third}} day of Pentecost. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> based on an earlier secular cantata for New Year's Day composed in Köthen (BWV 184a). The musicologist Szymon Paczkowski suggests two other possible occasions for the secular model: the birthday of Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Coethen on 10 December 1720, and the wedding of the prince and Friderica Henrietta on 11 December 1721.|$|E
5|$|In his Autobiography, the Romanian philosopher Mircea Eliade {{indicated}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> that his ancestors, whose original surname was Ieremia, had adopted the new {{name as a}} tribute to Heliade Rădulescu, whom they probably admired.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} about their fate after the early 8th century. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that they became {{incorporated}} into the Khazar Khaganate.

2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> the [...] {{spot where}} the burial mounds was once farmland, though because of its poor soil the burial mounds were put there instead. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> there <b>are</b> more than three of the burial mounds, though no more have yet been found.|$|R
5|$|The Nine Stones, {{also known}} as the Devil's Nine Stones, the Nine Ladies, or Lady Williams and her Dog, is a stone circle located near to the village of Winterbourne Abbas in the {{south-western}} English county of Dorset. Archaeologists believe that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> erected during the Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|The event which devastated {{areas from}} Montgomery to Greene County caused $20,000,000 in damage and injured 20 people. While the Storm Prediction Center {{archives}} {{say that it}} was a single tornado, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> three or more tornadoes, each producing F3 to F4 damage. Only damage near Schoharie was at the F4 level, and some sources doubt it even reached that intensity at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{discovered}} by Europeans in the 17th century, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> earlier explored by aboriginals. It was initially used for storehouses before being purchased by the British, who built a prisoner-of-war camp to hold captives from the Napoleonic Wars and later the War of 1812. The burial ground for prisoners was on the adjacent Deadman's Island.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the final}} film for {{director}} Edwards, who died the following year, {{and was one of}} the last produced at Fox Film's New York studio. Contemporary reviews were generally positive. Like many of Fox's early works, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> lost in the 1937 Fox vault fire.|$|E
5|$|A Free Ride {{was first}} shown to its target {{audience}} in 1915. At that time, {{it was not}} possible to screen stag films in public theaters due to the Victorian moral views of contemporary society. Like other pornographic films of that era, A Free Ride was released and circulated underground to avoid censorship. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> shown in brothels, gentlemen's clubs, illegal gatherings of men in public places, stag parties, and other all-male venues: the film was kept hidden from society at large and the government.|$|E
5|$|A shot rang out. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> {{a warning}} shot fired by a panicked, {{exhausted}} British soldier from the 43rd, according to Captain Laurie's report to his commander after the fight. Two other regulars then fired immediately after that, shots splashing in the river, {{and then the}} narrow group up front, possibly thinking the order to fire had been given, fired a ragged volley before Laurie could stop them.|$|E

5|$|Such long-distance {{high-speed}} railways are {{not included}} in the preliminary long-term plan for 2010–2040, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that railways Hamar–Trondheim and Drammen–Kristansand will be built first since they are easier to build. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that a high-speed railway to Bergen will be built sometime in the period 2030–2060.|$|R
50|$|According to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's plan {{to expand}} into the Schuylkill {{neighborhood}}, sources say <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that the Devil's Pocket neighborhood will be absorbed into its neighboring community due to the vast nature of the project as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> going to make Devil's Pocket indistinguishable from its neighbor.|$|R
5|$|After a {{lunch with}} Logan, Veronica notices that the Hearst Lampoon’s offices were egged. Weevil tells her the Dean's office was egged the same night, which Veronica relays to her father. Keith {{receives}} {{the police report}} of Dean O’Dell’s death, but he doesn’t find anything useful in it. Keith interrogates the Lilith house girls, who admit to egging his office, but seem to have alibis for the Dean’s death. However, Keith later informs Veronica that Nish’s alibi doesn’t check out for the Dean’s car but that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> true for Mindy’s car, putting her under suspicion.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, county {{officials}} admitted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> that the $7million appropriated {{would not be}} enough, and instead {{it would be better}} spent on improving other nearby parkways. The proposed parkway would have needed $400,000 more for additional right-of-way, and the construction costs would leave no money to repave the Bronx River Parkway, the link to the Cross County Parkway, and to extend the Saw Mill River Parkway. The county would have had to spend $8million of its own money as well. The parkway was instead shortened from Bronxville to Elmsford.|$|E
5|$|Independent {{lines of}} {{evidence}} from Type Ia supernovae and the CMB {{imply that the}} universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as dark energy, which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused {{the expansion of the}} universe to slowly begin to accelerate.|$|E

50|$|Though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} largest genus within Megaspilidae, {{little is known about}} its life history. A few species are known to <b>be</b> ectoparasitoids, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that the genus also {{contains}} endoparasitoids as well, since the sister genus Dendrocerus contains both life strategies. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that Conostigmus contains hyperparasitoids as well.|$|R

5|$|Kingston Russell Stone Circle, {{also known}} as the Gorwell Circle, is a stone circle located between the villages of Abbotsbury and Littlebredy in the {{south-western}} English county of Dorset. Archaeologists believe that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> erected during the Bronze Age. The Kingston Russell ring is part of a tradition of stone circle construction that spread throughout much of Britain, Ireland, and Brittany during the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, over a period between 3,300 and 900 BCE. The purpose of such monuments is unknown, although archaeologists speculate that they were likely religious sites, with the stones perhaps having supernatural associations for those who built the circles.|$|E
5|$|Life's Shop Window was {{the first}} film produced, rather than simply distributed, by William Fox's Box Office Attractions Company, the {{corporate}} predecessor to Fox Film. Several reviewers approved of the film's expurgated treatment of the novel's plot, although opinions {{of the quality of}} the film itself were mixed. It proved very popular upon its initial release in New York, and that success was used to advertise the film elsewhere. Like many of Fox's early works, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> lost in the 1937 Fox vault fire.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 1960, Pollard succeeded Lieutenant General Sir Ragnar Garrett as Chief of the General Staff (CGS), and {{was raised}} to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours promulgated on 2June 1961. Although favoured by Garrett, Pollard's {{succession}} {{had not been a}} foregone conclusion. The Minister for the Army, John Cramer, attempted to appoint Major General Ivan Dougherty, a retired CMF officer, but the proposal was defeated in cabinet on the advice of the Minister for Defence, Athol Townley, who feared the antagonism <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> to engender among the senior ranks of the Regular Army.|$|E

60|$|If coal has {{all been}} {{vegetable}} soil, then <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> {{that some of}} <b>it</b> has not <b>been</b> quite converted into shapeless coal. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> {{that there will be}} vegetable fibre still to be seen here and there; perhaps leaves, perhaps even stems of trees, as in a peat bog.

5|$|On September 6, Art Modell died in Baltimore {{at the age}} of 87. Although the Browns {{planned to}} have a moment of silence on their home opener for their former owner, his family asked the team not to, well aware of the less-than-friendly {{reaction}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> to get. Weeden started the Browns' first game of the season. The 28-year-old rookie threw four interceptions in a 17–16 loss to Philadelphia in which the Browns' only touchdown was scored by the defense.|$|E
5|$|Talks {{began on}} 30 April 1634, and the Treaty of Polyanovka {{was signed in}} May, {{putting an end to}} hostilities. The treaty {{confirmed}} the pre-war status quo, with Russia paying a large war indemnity (20,000 rubles in gold), while Władysław agreed to surrender his claim to the Russian throne and return the royal insignia to Moscow. Jasienica notes that from the Russian perspective <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> that Władysław's abnegation of his claim was more important, in terms of the subsequent increase in internal stability, than the loss of disputed borderland. Despite not winning militarily, the Russians may have scored a diplomatic triumph. Other authors, such as Hellie, support this interpretation.|$|E
5|$|The {{interplanetary medium}} {{is home to}} at least two disc-like regions of cosmic dust. The first, the zodiacal dust cloud, lies in the inner Solar System and causes the zodiacal light. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> formed by {{collisions}} within the asteroid belt brought on by gravitational interactions with the planets. The second dust cloud extends from about 10AU to about 40AU, and was probably created by similar collisions within the Kuiper belt.|$|E
2500|$|The Dexters, as {{prominent}} citizens, entertained {{many important}} visitors, including US Presidents James K. Polk and James Buchanan. [...] Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not certain, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> {{that a third}} president, Millard Fillmore, also visited Gordon Hall – <b>it</b> <b>is</b> known that Fillmore visited his brother Calvin, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> the pair would have toured the house that Calvin designed.|$|R
