Unfortunately, Lord iEvil couldn't take it back because Weebl removed the warranty sticker, rendering it void.|$|E
50|$|The optical {{construction}} is changed. The metal body {{is replaced by}} a plastic body. Consequently, the lens is much lighter. The second generation has a focus <b>hold</b> <b>button.</b> Starting from the third generation, this lens is produced in black or silver color.|$|E
50|$|On {{the side}} of the lens lies a set of four {{external}} controls for enabling image stabilization, limiting the focal range of the lens, and changing focusing modes. It also features an external focus <b>hold</b> <b>button</b> for locking in focus on a subject in motion.|$|E
50|$|The {{user manual}} {{says that when}} the phone is powered down, you should <b>hold</b> the power <b>button</b> down until the Samsung logo appears. That time seems to vary, but you {{actually}} only have to <b>hold</b> the <b>button</b> down 6.5 seconds.|$|R

50|$|The Intelligent Parking Assist System feature (also called Advanced Parking Guidance System) can parallel-park or reverse-park the LS into a {{preselected}} {{space with}} minimal brake input at {{the push of}} a button. This feature utilizes the backup camera and parking sensors. Other drive-assist features include Dynamic Radar Cruise Control, which can accelerate and brake while monitoring traffic (similar to Mercedes-Benz's Distronic Plus), a Brake <b>Hold</b> <b>button,</b> which prevents creeping forward motion when the driver's foot is off the brake pedal, and the Automatic Parking Brake, which can engage the parking brake simultaneously whenever the transmission is shifted to Park.|$|E
5000|$|An {{arpeggiator}}, with {{a choice}} of up, down, up/down, or random mode. The arpeggiator can be prominently heard in Duran Duran's 1982 hit single [...] "Rio." [...] Switches on the far left select between the internal rate, adjustable, or an external source, such as the clock out of its contemporary, the Roland CR-78—a programmable analog drum machine. A <b>hold</b> <b>button</b> on the lower front panel allows users to latch or set a constantly running arpeggiator pattern, useful when playing leads on another machine over a JP-4 pattern. Otherwise the arpeggiation only responds when keys, individual or chords, are pressed. This allows for a more fluid and less rigid timing in live situations when playing with others.|$|E

50|$|The game also {{features}} a new precision throw control. Players use the right analog stick in order {{to throw the ball}} to the bases.

30|$|During {{the last}} minute of each phase, we {{collected}} the following respiratory variables: peak airway pressure, Pplat, mean airway pressure, PEEPi, PEEP, driving airway pressure (∆Paw), Vt, dead space-to-Vt ratio (Vd/Vt), static compliance of the respiratory system (Crs) and airway resistance. At the same time, we recorded the following gas exchange variables: pH, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2), PaCO 2 and end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration in the mixed expired gas (EtCO 2). PEEPi was measured with a prolonged end-expiratory pause of 4  s, performed using the ventilator expiratory <b>hold</b> <b>button.</b> EtCO 2 was measured continuously with a CO 2 mainstream sensor (General Electric Capnostat, Milwaukee, WI, USA). The mean value of the last 10 recorded EtCO 2 values in each {{phase of the study}} was used for analysis.|$|E
5000|$|Guitar Rockstar is the European {{brand name}} for a virtual air guitar, {{manufactured}} by Tomy. It originated {{and continues to be}} sold by Tomy in Japan under the brand name [...] "Air Guitar". Gameplay consists of <b>holding</b> <b>buttons</b> representing notes and strumming where the strings would be, in a similar fashion to air guitar. An infra-red beam passes {{from the end of the}} guitar head, and as your hand passes through the invisible infra-red beam a note is played.|$|R

5000|$|The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - On the PC version, <b>holding</b> both <b>buttons</b> {{activates}} dual casting, shield bashing, or {{a powerful}} flurry of attacks when dual-wielding melee weapons.|$|R
50|$|The game {{features}} hack and slash combat. Some of {{the fights}} end with quick time sequences. The player can use points {{to upgrade their}} weapons. In some sections of the game the player has their weapons removed and has to fight by hand. The gameplay features frequent loading times. The player can perform both light and heavy attacks and can <b>hold</b> <b>buttons</b> to release special attacks. The player can wield swords, bones, bows, and scorpion tails. The enemies have health bars with colors to show how much health they have left.|$|R

50|$|<b>Holding</b> down <b>buttons</b> while {{moving the}} mouse can be awkward and {{requires}} some practice, since the downwards action increases friction for the horizontal motion. An optical mouse {{would be less}} susceptible to changes in behavior than a ball mouse with increased friction because the sensor does not rely on mechanical contact to sense movement; a touchpad provides no added friction with all its buttons held down with a thumb. However, it was also argued that muscular tension resulting from <b>holding</b> down <b>buttons</b> could be exploited in user interface design as it gives constant feedback that the user is in a temporary state, or mode (Buxton, 1995).|$|R
5000|$|Starfighters are {{equipped}} with different weaponry which can be highly effective in certain missions. The use of the force weapons in the Jedi Starfighter present a unique aspect to the genre. Force weapons are activated by <b>holding</b> a <b>button</b> which begins to turn the screen purple, and releasing it before the screen becomes white. <b>Holding</b> the <b>button</b> {{for just the right}} amount of time will cause the force weapon to last longer or destroy more targets. Holding it too long or too short will reduce its effectiveness. Although unlimited in number, force weapons take several seconds to [...] "recharge" [...] while Adi is regaining her mental strength.|$|R
