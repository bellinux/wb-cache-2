5|$|Publicity for IRIS in Japan {{was strong}} from its premiere and beyond. In late May 2010, {{a set of}} two concert events billed as {{dramatic}} live stage shows drew sold-out crowds that amounted to over 60,000 attendees. The concerts were a combination of live interviews {{with much of the}} primary cast, re-enactments of pivotal scenes from the series, and performances by the musical acts featured in its soundtrack. Broadcaster TBS revealed in June 2010 that airings of the series on its satellite offerings had broken records daily, doubling the ratings of its previous programs. Such was the influence of the series that flights between Seoul and Akita that had been nearing decommission were revitalized as a result of mounting tourist interest. Due to the commerce generated for Akita prefecture as a result of Iris having filmed there, local governments in Japan began competing <b>for</b> <b>interest</b> from producers in order to solicit tourists with future installments of the series.|$|E

25|$|Indeed, a {{key reason}} for using {{continuous}} compounding is {{to simplify the}} analysis of varying discount rates and to allow one to use the tools of calculus. Further, <b>for</b> <b>interest</b> accrued and capitalized overnight (hence compounded daily), continuous compounding is a close approximation for the actual daily compounding. More sophisticated analysis includes the use of differential equations, as detailed below.|$|E
25|$|As {{suggested}} by the etymology of the word, {{one of the earliest}} reasons <b>for</b> <b>interest</b> in geometry was surveying, and certain practical results from Euclidean geometry, such as the right-angle property of the 3-4-5 triangle, were used long before they were proved formally. The fundamental types of measurements in Euclidean geometry are distances and angles, and both of these quantities can be measured directly by a surveyor. Historically, distances were often measured by chains such as Gunter's chain, and angles using graduated circles and, later, the theodolite.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, these created {{problems}} for some banks {{as the high}} inflation of that period resulted in them borrowing money at higher rates than they could lend it. In response to this asset liability mismatch, libertarians and free-market advocates called <b>for</b> <b>interest</b> rate caps to be increased or repealed entirely as an unreasonable restriction on market forces. Bills to do so were introduced in Congress and some state legislatures. Some succeeded in the former goal, but those that sought to eliminate interest rate caps entirely failed.|$|E
25|$|The musical {{traditions of}} Suvalkija are distinctive. The kanklės, {{possibly}} the most archaic Lithuanian instrument, took on distinguishable characteristics in the region; more heavily ornamented than elsewhere, its end is narrow, spreading out into a rounded shape. Recordings made in the 1930s, and reissued {{in the 21st century}} by the Institute of Lithuanian Literature and Folklore, contain waltzes, marches, schottisches, and krakowiaks. Popular polkas performed on the fiddle were {{a significant part of the}} local musicians' repertoire. The recordings from this era are monodic; there is usually one singer, and the music relies on variable modal structures, changes of tempo, and subtle ornamentation of the melody <b>for</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first {{substantial}} Jewish {{population in}} England arrived after the Norman Conquest, reportedly migrating from Rouen in Normandy. By the mid-12th century, there were Jewish communities {{in most of}} England's major cities. Although there were violent anti-Jewish massacres and riots in several cities, Jews were theoretically {{under the protection of}} the Crown because of the their financial importance. However, in 1275, King Edward I passed the Statute of Jewry, which compelled Jews to be identified by a yellow badge and outlawed usury, the lending of money <b>for</b> <b>interest,</b> which was the main source of income for many Jewish families. Following increasing state persecution and attempts to force conversion to Christianity, Edward finally expelled all Jews from England in 1290.|$|E

25|$|After 1300, Jews {{suffered}} more {{discrimination and}} persecution in Christian Europe. As Catholics were forbidden {{by the church}} to loan money <b>for</b> <b>interest,</b> some Jews became prominent moneylenders. Christian rulers gradually saw the advantage of having such a class of people who could supply capital for their use without being liable to excommunication. As a result, the money trade of western Europe became a specialty of the Jews. But, in almost every instance when Jews acquired large amounts through banking transactions, during their lives or upon their deaths, the king would take it over. Jews became imperial servi cameræ, {{the property of the}} King, who might present them and their possessions to princes or cities.|$|E
25|$|The debt {{incurred}} by the toll company was paid off by August 2013. The company had by the collected NOK1,400 million, twice the {{debt incurred}}. The remainder was used <b>for</b> <b>interest</b> and {{to operate the}} toll plaza, which cost NOK14 million in 2012. In March 2012 the Public Roads Administration, based on the {{plans to build a}} second tube, announced a prolonging of the toll period, initially with another three years. The agency stated that advanced tolls on a new tube would allow for a lower total toll collection, as interest payments would be lowered. In addition the tolls would stimulate for less traffic through the tunnel, which the agency wanted to reduce until a second tube opens. Should the second tube not be built, the tolls will be used for other projects in the area.|$|E
25|$|Especially for mining {{projects}} in upper Hungary the Fugger company required enormous capital, {{which at the}} time it could not raise. Hence Cardinal Melchior von Meckau was the main sponsor of the Fugger business in 1496. The Prince-Bishop had secretly and unknown to his church chapter invested 150.000 guilders into the Fugger company in return <b>for</b> <b>interest,</b> thereby evading the official church ban on interest. When he died in Rome in 1509 this investment was uncovered. The Pope, the bishopric Brixen and the family of Meckau all claiming the inheritance now demanded the immediate payback of these assets which would have resulted in insolvency for Jakob Fugger. It was this situation that prompted Emperor Maximilian I to step in and assist his banker. On the condition of assisting Pope Julius II in a war against the Republic of Venice the Habsburg monarch was recognized as being the rightful heir of Cardinal Melchior von Meckau. The inheritance could now be settled by amortizing outstanding debts. Fugger also had to deliver jewels as compensation to the Pope. However, in return for his support, Maximilian I demanded the continuous financial support of his ongoing military and political campaigns.|$|E

25|$|Fifth, {{the holders}} of a {{floating}} charge holders must be paid. Like a fixed charge, a floating charge {{can be created}} by a contract with a company before insolvency. Like with a fixed charge, this is usually done {{in return for a}} loan from a bank. But unlike a fixed charge, a floating charge need not refer to a specific asset of the company. It can cover the entire business, including a fluctuating body of assets that is traded with day today, or assets that a company will receive in future. The preferential categories were created by statute to prevent secured creditors taking all assets away. This reflected the view that the power of freedom of contract should be limited to protect employees, small businesses or consumers who have unequal bargaining power. After funds are taken away to pay all preferential groups and the holder of a floating charge, the remaining money due to unsecured creditors. In 2001 recovery rates were found to be 53% of one's debt for secured lenders, 35% for preferential creditors but only 7% for unsecured creditors on average. Seventh comes any money due <b>for</b> <b>interest</b> on debts proven in the winding up process. In eighth place is money due to company members under a share redemption contract. Ninth are debts due to members who hold preferential rights. And tenth, ordinary shareholders, have the right to residual assets.|$|E
500|$|The encyclical, however, did allow {{extrinsic}} {{interest to}} be charged, stating that [...] "legitimate reasons arise to demand something {{over and above}} the amount due on the contract" [...] as long as those reasons are [...] "not at all intrinsic to the contract." [...] The Holy Office would later expand upon these extrinsic justifications <b>for</b> <b>interest</b> in 1780 and 1784 to include [...] "compensation" [...] for the hazards and delays of repayment. The encyclical also did not prohibit profit from non-lending investment.|$|E
500|$|Covered {{interest}} rate parity (CIRP) {{is found to}} hold when there is open capital mobility and limited capital controls, and this finding is confirmed for all currencies freely traded in the present day. One such example is when the United Kingdom and Germany abolished capital controls between 1979 and 1981. Maurice Obstfeld and Alan Taylor calculated hypothetical profits as implied by {{the expression of a}} potential inequality in the CIRP equation (meaning a difference in returns on domestic versus foreign assets) during the 1960s and 1970s, which would have constituted arbitrage opportunities if not for the prevalence of capital controls. However, given financial liberalization and resulting capital mobility, arbitrage temporarily became possible until equilibrium was restored. Since the abolition of capital controls in the United Kingdom and Germany, potential arbitrage profits have been near zero. Factoring in transaction costs arising from fees and other regulations, arbitrage opportunities are fleeting or nonexistent when such costs exceed deviations from parity. While CIRP generally holds, it does not hold with precision due to the presence of transaction costs, political risks, tax implications <b>for</b> <b>interest</b> earnings versus gains from foreign exchange, and differences in the liquidity of domestic versus foreign assets.|$|E

500|$|In 1937 John Hicks {{published}} an article that incorporated Keynes's thought into a general equilibrium framework where the markets for goods and money met in an overall equilibrium. Hick's IS/LM (Investment-Savings/Liquidity preference-Money supply) model {{became the basis for}} decades of theorizing and policy analysis into the 1960s. The model represents the goods market with the IS curve, a set of points representing equilibrium in investment and savings. The money market equilibrium is represented with the LM curve, a set of points representing the equilibrium in supply and demand for money. The intersection of the curves identifies an aggregate equilibrium in the economy where there are unique equilibrium values <b>for</b> <b>interest</b> rates and economic output. The IS/LM model focused on interest rates as the [...] "monetary transmission mechanism," [...] the channel through which money supply affects real variables like aggregate demand and employment. A decrease in money supply would lead to higher interest rates, which reduce investment and thereby lower output throughout the economy. Other economists built on the IS/LM framework. Notably, in 1944, Franco Modigliani added a labor market. Modigliani's model represented the economy as a system with general equilibrium across the interconnected markets for labor, finance, and goods, and it explained unemployment with rigid nominal wages.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, {{before he}} {{became a member of the}} city council, Schiff co-authored an {{amendment}} to the City of Minneapolis Charter that mandated a voter referendum on city stadium subsidies that cost taxpayers over $10 million. As of 2009, the Minnesota Vikings were moving forward on a $870 million plan to rebuild a downtown stadium on the site of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. The team also considered building a new stadium in other cities, including Anoka, Minnesota and Los Angeles, California. Though supportive of the Vikings remaining in Minneapolis in 2012, Schiff became an outspoken critic of the financing plan for the stadium when it came to a vote before the Minneapolis City Council, in part because it bypassed the charter amendment. [...] Schiff also argued that the plan's estimated cost to Minneapolis taxpayers, cited at $150 million in construction costs, failed to account <b>for</b> <b>interest,</b> maintenance costs, and upgrades over the course of the stadium's expected 30-year lifespan. In a Star Tribune editorial, Schiff quoted figures presented by the city's chief financial officer, Kevin Carpenter, which estimated a cumulative, 30-year cost that could range from $675 million to $890 million. Despite Schiff's objections, the Minneapolis City Council approved the stadium financing 7-6. Subsequently, the football team moved forward with plans to demolish the Metrodome and rebuild a new stadium on the site, and Governor Mark Dayton signed a financing plan approved by the legislature.|$|E
