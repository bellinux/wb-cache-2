Huck is caught holding hands with Becky (Lisa) and is forced to marry her by her father (Homer). Huck dodges the {{marriage}} and goes on the run with Tom, leaving Missouri for Missoura. However, they are chased by townspeople led by Becky's father and their families. Huck and Tom flee to a river boat, but are thrown into the Mississippi River and are caught by the townspeople. At their funeral, Tom and Huck are first revealed to not be in their caskets, seemingly watching the proceedings from the rafters which they <b>have</b> <b>big</b> smiles on their faces, until Reverend Lovejoy orders their bodies lowered into the caskets, revealing that Tom and Huck are in fact dead.|$|E

25|$|In the {{architecture}} of Cistercian churches the transept is usually quite wide and the lateral aisles are covered with groined vaults that help to sustain the longitudinal central nave. There is a clear preference for square-shaped apses, more simple and economical to build.

Although Tarouca Abbey was clearly inspired in the Burgundian abbeys of Clairvaux and Fontenay and Salzedas still have some similarities with Fontfroide, their authentic and magnificent Cistercian architectural features are mixed with local Portuguese decorative motifs.|$|E

25|$|In Denmark {{district}} heating covers more than 60% of space heating and water heating. In 2007, 80.5% of this heat {{was produced by}} {{combined heat and power}} plants. Heat recovered from waste incineration accounted for 20.4% of the total Danish district heat production. In 2013, Denmark imported 158,000 ton waste for incineration. Most major cities in Denmark <b>have</b> <b>big</b> {{district heating}} networks, including transmission networks operating with up to 125°C and 25 bar pressure and distribution networks operating with up to 95°C and between 6 and 10 bar pressure. The largest district heating system in Denmark is in the Copenhagen area operated by CTR I/S and VEKS I/S. In central Copenhagen, the CTR network serves 275,000 households (90-95% of the area's population) through a network of 54km double district heating distribution pipes providing a peak capacity of 663MW. The consumer price of heat from CTR is approximately €49 perMWh plus taxes (2009).|$|E
25|$|Gwalior is {{surrounded}} by 3 Industrial areas – Sitholi, Banmore and Malanpur. All three of these sectors are on NH 75, NH-3 and NH 92 respectively, with Malanpur being the largest. The city used to <b>have</b> <b>big</b> manufacturing industries, such as Gwalior Grasim and J.C. MILLS of Birlanagar, but now this sector is left with only one major factory – J.B.Mangharam Ltd. But the other 3 sectors have many industries. The important ones are from dairy, chemical, manufacturing, textiles, and other industries. Handicraft and small industries are also found like Gwalior potteries. Gwalior {{is also an important}} historical and tourism sector of the country. Therefore, the tourism sector also puts an effect into the city's economy. Gwalior is part of NCR. The Gwalior Trade Fair is an annual trade fair showcasing the economy of Gwalior.

25|$|Bradypodion pumilum have a {{much higher}} {{survival}} rate in a metropolitan area if they are bigger in size. Their survival rate was dependent on body size, and the larger the size, the greater the chance that the individual would survive a ten-day period. Larger, older chameleons {{tend to be more}} sedentary compared to the smaller younger ones which means that the larger ones likely have smaller home ranges. Smaller chameleons inhabit grasses while larger chameleons are found mainly in bushes and trees. This is territorial, because it is believed that larger males would cannibalize smaller ones intruding on their territory. An alternative thought is that the smaller chameleons simply do not <b>have</b> <b>big</b> enough limbs to grasp larger branches correctly. When fighting contests occur, the outcome is influenced by the height of the ornamental casque, the relative size of the pink patch {{in the center of the}} flank, and previous experience. The ornamental casque is the protruding head piece of the chameleon, usually with a rounded end. The height of this piece is an honest signal to other male chameleons representing its total size. Similarly with the pink patch in the center of the flank, this is an honest signal showing that the chameleon has a healthy diet correlating to the strength of the individual. The turnover rate in males is thought to be higher than females.|$|E

500|$|It {{has yet to}} be {{determined}} why such an integumentary change might have occurred. A precedent for feather loss can be seen in other dinosaur groups such as ornithischians, in which filamentous structures were lost, and scales reappeared. Although gigantism has been suggested as a mechanism, Phil R. Bell, who co-authored the study, noted that the feathered Yutyrannus overlapped in size with Gorgosaurus and Albertosaurus.

[...] Sonia Chopra of Sify gave it 3 out of 5, and mentioned, [...] "Debut director Karan Malhotra shows great promise in making the film visually arresting and maintaining the consistency of performances.

[...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave Agneepath 3 out of 5 and said, [...] "It is in the end, an old-fashioned revenge drama treated in that melodramatic, over-the-top style.

500|$|A cult film is any {{film that}} has a cult following, {{although}} the term is not easily defined and {{can be applied to}} a wide variety of films. The definition is occasionally expanded to exclude films that have been released by major studios or <b>have</b> <b>big</b> budgets, try specifically to become cult films, or become accepted by mainstream audiences and critics. Cult films are defined by audience reaction as much as by their content. This may take the form of elaborate and ritualized audience participation, film festivals, or cosplay. Over time, the definition has become more vague and inclusive as it drifts away from earlier, stricter views. [...] Increasing use of the term by mainstream publications has resulted in controversy, as cinephiles argue that the term has become meaningless or [...] "elastic, a catchall for anything slightly maverick or strange". [...] Academic Mark Shiel has criticized the term itself as being a weak concept, reliant on subjectivity; different groups can interpret films in their own terms. [...] According to feminist scholar Joanne Hollows, this subjectivity causes films with large female cult followings to be perceived as too mainstream and not transgressive enough to qualify as a cult film. Academic Mike Chopra‑Gant says that cult films become decontextualized when studied as a group, and Shiel criticizes this recontextualization as cultural commodification.|$|E

[...] "DNA" [...] was deemed [...] "amazing" [...] by Clemmie Moodie of the Daily Mirror. Eve Barlow for NME likened the song to Katy Perry's [...] "E.T." [...] and described it as [...] "a banger".
