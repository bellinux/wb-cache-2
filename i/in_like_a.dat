However, it was a commercial disappointment, reaching a peak of only 78 on the Billboard Hot 100.

500|$|Richard was nicknamed [...] "the Comet" [...] {{early in}} his career. When {{teammate}} Ray Getliffe remarked that Richard [...] "went <b>in</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rocket" [...] {{as he approached the}} opposition goal, Richard was dubbed [...] "The Rocket" [...] by a local sportswriter; both Baz O'Meara from the Montreal Star and Dink Carroll of the Montreal Gazette have been credited for the appellation. The nickname described Richard's play in terms of speed, strength, and determination. Teammate and coach Toe Blake said the moniker was fitting because [...] "when he would take off, nothing got in his way that could stop him". Goaltender Jacques Plante declared {{it one of the most}} appropriate nicknames given to an athlete, noting the fierce intensity that often showed in Richard's eyes and comparing it to [...] "the rocket's red glare" [...] referenced in [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner". Glenn Hall agreed: [...] "What I remember most about Rocket was his eyes. When he came flying toward you with the puck on his stick, his eyes were all lit up, flashing and gleaming like a pinball machine. It was terrifying." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{popular belief}} {{suggests}} that the name derives from the French term [...] "petit coude", meaning [...] "little elbow". In fact, the name derives from an indigenous word, probably Maliseet or, possibly [...] Mi'kmaq. According to Maliseet Elder and linguist Dr. Peter Paul of Woodstock Reserve, the name refers to a wall of water rushing in: [...] "now they call that petakuyak. [...] means 'sound of thunder,' well, the rush of water coming <b>in</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> thunderstorm." [...] If the term has a Mi'kmaq origin, {{it could have been}} derived from the word Petkootkweăk, meaning [...] "the river that bends like a bow", a reference to the right angle bend near Moncton. Acadians transformed this to Petcoudiac or Petitcoudiac, which was modified to Petitcodiac by British settlers. The river's heavy sedimentation led to the nickname [...] "Chocolate River", due to the resulting brown tint. When the Petitcodiac River Causeway was built, an additional [...] of this sediment began to accumulate in the 4.7km (2.9mi) of river downstream from it.|$|E

500|$|The both {{versions}} of the game, for the PC and the Amiga, were developed separately and simultaneously, {{in order to make}} the best possible product for each platform rather than a quick port from one system to another. A version for the Amiga CD32 had also been planned. The game mixes backgrounds hand-drawn with acrylic paint and then digitized by the Mohr, and sprite bitmap graphics made in Deluxe Paint and Brilliance on the Amiga with some rotoscoped animations. The animators Billy Allison and Stuart Atkinson created [...] "huge" [...] DPaint-made character sequences but they had to implement them in game in more efficient way due to computer memory limitations. In addition, the PC version used the full 8-bit color of a 256 color palette, but the Amiga version had to be downscaled to only 32 colors (including 24 colors for the background and eight colors for the main character; the other characters had to be drawn with these colors). The game also uses various digitized sound effects. Allison said, [...] "there were whole sections that never made it <b>in,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> roller skating frankenstein, that shattered into loads of tiny versions of him if you 'killed' him, I did the sprites etc, it just never made it to the game." ...|$|E
500|$|The film premiered on May 20, in {{competition}} at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. At its first showing to the media, the film received abundant praise, and garnered [...] "some of the best responses of the festival," [...] but Xan Brooks of The Guardian, who gave it a positive review, said it [...] "can't win, won't win" [...] Cannes's top prize. Brooks explained that [...] "t's too self-consciously retro, too much a series of cool, blank surfaces {{as opposed to a}} rounded, textured drama," [...] but said that it was his [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] of the 2011 competition, labeling it an enjoyable affair. He said, [...] "Over the past 10 days we've witnessed great art and potent social commentary; the birth of the cosmos {{and the end of the}} world. Turns out what we really wanted all along was a scene in which a man gets his head stomped in a lift. They welcome it <b>in</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> long-lost relation." [...] The film was greeted with hoots and howls of joy from the media, with viewers cheering on some of the scenes featuring extreme violence. Drive also received a 15-minute standing ovation from the crowd. The festival named Refn best director for Drive.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Fatbeard" [...] was watched by 2.59 million overall households, {{according to the}} Nielsen ratings, making it the most-watched Comedy Central production of the week. The episode received generally positive reviews. Carlos Delgado of If magazine, who gave the episode an A- grade, particularly praised the Cartman and Ike characters and called the ending [...] "perfect". Delgado said of the show's creators, [...] "These guys see episode potential in nearly everything that passes through the news desk. And because South Park can be made <b>in</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> week—and I’m talking start to finish, from concept to finished product—they {{end up being the}} most socially conscious and timely show on television today." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode and the Somalian pirate song, and complimented the show for presenting the pirates as sympathetic human beings. Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club said the portrayal of Somalian pirates was a predictable storyline, but said he enjoyed the episode because of the pacing: [...] "Rather than a cobbled-together collection of gags, everything progressed very organically." [...] IGN writer Travis Fickett said the episode was amusing but not exceptional. Fickett enjoyed the takeover of the French vessel {{and the extent to which}} Cartman's delusion about pirates takes him, but he said the pirate plot [...] "isn't entirely in good taste (and) it never really gathers a full head of steam".|$|E
