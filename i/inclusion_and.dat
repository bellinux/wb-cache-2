Carlisle was among those who criticised FIFA president Sepp Blatter following his comments in November 2011 that racism was no longer a problem in football. In February 2012, he was part of a PFA delegation that met with British Prime Minister David Cameron to discuss the issues of racism and homophobia in the sport.|$|E

5|$|While the {{selection}} process is need-blind and race-blind, most of the best high schools and preparatory schools in Brazil are private and very expensive, and represent a majority of admissions in Brazilian public universities, leading to increased inequality in the country. To remedy this, Unicamp introduced in 2004 the Social <b>Inclusion</b> <b>and</b> Affirmative Action Program (PAAIS, in Portuguese Programa de Ação Afirmativa e Inclusão Social) that allows high schoolers coming from public schools to receive a bonus score in their overall vestibular score. While not focused on racial and ethnical factors, over the years, the PAAIS initiative has {{increased the number of}} admission of minorities from public high school, especially black and native-Brazilians, historically the most economical and social fragile groups in Brazil. With this program, around 30% of admissions come from public schools, and the participation of minorities increased from 10% to around 30%.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Textural {{relations}} and chemical zoning of cordierites in granites act as sensitive recorders {{of the conditions}} of their crystallisation history and underlying magma chamber processes. In this contribution, we present new data on texturally distinct and variably zoned cordierites from the late-Devonian, granitic South Mountain and Musquodoboit Batholiths, and infer the conditions of their formation. Using a combined textural (grain size, grain shape <b>and</b> <b>inclusion</b> relationships) <b>and</b> chemical (major element composition and compositional zoning) classification, we recognise the following six cordierite types: CG 1 /TT 1, anhedral to subhedral macrocrysts with random <b>inclusions</b> <b>and</b> patchy normal zoning; CG 2 a/TT 2, euhedral to subhedral macrocrysts with random <b>inclusions</b> <b>and</b> normal zoning; CG 2 b/TT 2, euhedral to subhedral macrocrysts with random or oriented <b>inclusions,</b> <b>and</b> oscillatory zoning; CG 3 a/TT 3, subhedral to euhedral microcrysts with no <b>inclusions</b> <b>and</b> reverse zoning; CG 3 b/TT 4, euhedral macrocrysts with no <b>inclusions</b> <b>and</b> no zoning; and CG 4 /TT 5, anhedral macrocrysts with random <b>inclusions</b> <b>and</b> normal zoning. The textural criteria suggest that these cordierites formed {{as a product of}} cotectic crystallisation from a melt, or {{as the result of a}} peritectic reaction involving country-rock material. The combined chemical and textural criteria suggest that: (1) normal zoning results from cotectic crystallisation during cooling, cotectic overgrowths on grains formed in a peritectic reaction with country-rock material, or cation exchange with a fluid; (2) oscillatory zoning results from cotectic crystallisation during variations in XMg of the silicate melt following magma replenishment; (3) reverse zoning results from crystallisation during pressure quenching; and (4) the unzoned cordierite results from cotectic crystallisation under fluid-rich conditions...|$|R

He also commented favorably on the gags that describe Russia as filled with bears on unicycles and that Adam West {{turns out to be}} the Russian sleeper agent. He criticized the improv comedy storyline, and commented that improv troupes and 1980s comedies are lazy targets. He graded the episode a B, tying with The Simpsons and American Dad!, and beating its spin-off The Cleveland Show. IGN Television critic Ahsan Haque gave the episode a mixed review, stating that he did not like the improv storyline, and he was not amused with Peter's usage of Joe's American flag as toilet paper. However, he praised the scene that involved Stewie's, Brian's, Chevy Chase's, and Dan Aykroyd's travel to Russia, and he ultimately gave the episode 7.7 out of 10.|$|E
