It employs the same strikes and blocks as Shotokan's taikyoku shodan, but employs the shiko dachi ("straddle-leg stance", similar to the [...] "horse stance") in half facing {{position}} (hanmi) instead of the front stance. The second in the series, taikyoku chudan, alternates between front stance and sanchin dachi ("hourglass stance") and the low blocks have been replaced with soto uke (outer mid-level block). The third kata, taikyoku jodan, is identical to chudan but replaces the soto uke with jodan age uke (high block). The fourth, taikyoku tora guchi, is named after the trapping technique/block it teaches: the double handed hooking block, tora guchi.

40|$|In March 2008, {{an adult}} male (the victim) {{sustained}} fatal injuries when the crane boom he was disassembling buckled and crushed him. The truck-mounted lattice boom crane {{belonged to the}} owner of a construction company (the owner), who was a friend of the victim. The victim was not an employee of the construction company. At the time of the incident, the victim was at the owner’s yard assisting him in disassembling the boom. The boom was 55 feet long and composed of four sections: a base (15 feet), boom extension I (20 feet), boom extension II (10 feet) and a tip with the hook (10 feet). Adjacent sections were connected with eight bolts and four connecting pins. With the pendants (hoist cables) attached to the upper end or tip of the boom, the owner and the victim lowered the boom until the tip was approximately 4 feet above the ground. According to the owner, no connecting pins were to be removed until the pendants were moved from the tip to extension II and the tip section was cantilevered. The victim started removing the bolts while the owner was disassembling the <b>hook</b> <b>block</b> assembly near the tip end. In addition to removing the bolts, the victim also removed four lower connecting pins while positioning himself under the boom: two between the tip and extension II and two between extensions I and II.

50|$|A snapper is a hoax {{mechanical}} puzzle {{consisting of}} a pointed piece attached to a notched dowel and a hollow block with a secondary hole along its length through which a rubber-band is stretched (across the shaft) and tied off.

The demonstrator hands the puzzle to an observer who cannot hook the rubber-band onto the dowel's notch. The demonstrator takes the puzzle back and makes it snap immediately. The trick is that {{the ends of the}} dowel are tapered so that the demonstrator can squeeze the fingers holding it together, causing it to snap into the block.|$|R
40|$|Suppose that s, t ∈ N are {{relatively}} prime positive integers. In {{the study of}} block inclusions between s- and t-blocks of partitions [4] we introduced an (s, t) -abacus to study relations between s- and t-cores of partitions. This is because the cores determine the blocks. Before we state our main result let us mention that the basic facts about partitions, <b>hooks</b> and <b>blocks</b> of partitions {{may be found in}} [3], Chapter 2 or [5], Chapter 1. You may get to the s-core λ (s) of a partition λ by removing a series of s-hooks (hooks of length s) until all s-hooks are removed. The s-core is independent of the order in which the s-hooks are removed. A partition has by definition s-weight w, if you need to remove exactly w s-hooks to get to its s-core. It also equals the number of hooks in the partition of length divisible by s ([3], 2. 7. 40). Thus a partition is an s-core if and only if it has s-weight 0. Two partitions of n are said {{to be in the same}} s-block if they have the same s-core. This definition is of course inspired by the theorem which is still referred to as the Nakayama conjecture.

40|$|Abstract—While the {{foremost}} objective of ergonomic intervention {{research is the}} development and/or improvement of machine, tools, work methods, etc. which aim at risk reduction of work-related illnesses and injuries, intermediate steps are often required to illustrate the effectiveness and efficacy of the interventions. In this present study, the redesign rotated ice hook is made and laboratory evaluation is performed to demonstrate the efficiency of new design specifically to reduce non-neutral as well as extreme wrist postures in four fundamental wrist movements; flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. Evaluation was conducted in two sessions, simulated lifting task performed within laboratory and actual use at a real workplace. The quantitative results (i. e. the level of wrist angles) indicating {{a significant reduction in}} the biomechanical stresses identified as percentage of time spending in both non-neutral and extreme range of motion. In conclusion, the redesign hook resulted in ranged between 70 % and 100 % reduction of time spending in non-neutral wrist posture under laboratory session and from 24 % to 90 % reduction in the real workplace. Time reduction of wrist spending under extreme posture found to be 100 % for both testing sessions.

50|$|The USP is a {{semi-automatic}} pistol with a {{mechanically locked}} breech using the short recoil method of operation. This rather conventional lock-up system {{has a large}} rectangular lug over the barrel’s chamber that rides into and engages the ejection port cut-out in the slide. When a cartridge is fired, pressures generated by the ignited powder drive the cartridge casing back against the breech face on the slide, driving back both the barrel and slide as they remain locked together in the manner described above. After 3 mm of unrestricted rearward travel, the projectile has left the barrel and gas pressures have dropped to a safe level. A shaped lug {{on the underside of}} the barrel chamber comes into contact with a <b>hooked</b> locking <b>block</b> at the end of the steel recoil spring guide rod, lowering the rear end of the barrel and stopping the barrel's rearward movement. The recoil spring assembly is held in place by the slide stop lever’s axis pin and a round cut-out at the front of the slide. For enhanced reliability in high-dust environments, the locking surface on the front top of the barrel’s locking lug is tapered with a forward slope. This tapered surface produces a camming action which assists in positive lock-up in the presence of heavy fouling and debris. In this way, the USP shares many design features with the M1911 pistol, although apparently updated for easier operation.|$|R

6000|$|Walker got {{alongside}} of his whale, within {{half a mile}} of the two brigs, and to-leeward of both. In {{consequence of}} this favourable circumstance, the Henlopen soon had its prize hooked on, and her people at work stripping off the blubber. This is done by <b>hooking</b> the lower <b>block</b> of a powerful purchase in {{a portion of the}} substance, and then cutting a strip of convenient size, and heaving on the fall at the windlass. The strip is cut by implements called spades, and the blubber is torn from the carcass by the strain, after the sides of the [...] "blanket-piece," [...] as the strip is termed, are separated from the other portions of the animal by the cutting process.

5000|$|Defensively, {{the concept}} of [...] "wall of defense" [...] is used, in which shoulders, arms and legs are used to hinder the {{attacker}} from successfully executing techniques. Blocking is a critical element in muay Thai and compounds the level of conditioning a successful practitioner must possess. Low and mid body roundhouse kicks are normally blocked with the upper portion of a raised shin (this block {{is known as a}} 'check'). High body strikes are blocked ideally with the forearms and shoulder together, or if enough time is allowed for a parry, the glove (elusively), elbow, or shin will be used. Midsection roundhouse kicks can also be caught/trapped, allowing for a sweep or counter-attack to the remaining leg of the opponent. Punches are blocked with an ordinary boxing guard and techniques similar, if not identical, to basic boxing technique. A common means of blocking a punch is using the hand on the same side as the oncoming punch. For example, if an orthodox fighter throws a jab (being the left hand), the defender will make a slight tap to redirect the punch's angle with the right hand. The deflection is always as small and precise as possible to avoid unnecessary energy expenditure and return the hand to the guard as quickly as possible. <b>Hooks</b> are often <b>blocked</b> with a motion sometimes described as [...] "combing the hair", that is, raising the elbow forward and effectively shielding the head with the forearm, flexed biceps and shoulder. More advanced muay Thai blocks are usually in the form of counter-strikes, using the opponents weight (as they strike) to amplify the damage that the countering opponent can deliver. This requires impeccable timing and thus can generally only be learned by many repetitions.|$|R
