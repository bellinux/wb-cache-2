At least 1,900 communities were left without power as high winds knocked down numerous power lines. A total of 14 {{people were killed in}} China in <b>direct</b> <b>relation</b> to Wipha. One man was electrocuted and died after stepping into floodwaters with live power lines submerged in the water. A landslide triggered by the heavy rains killed five people. At least 11million people were affected by the storm in Fujian and Zhejiang. Once floodwaters receded, a car was found turned over, the five passengers inside were declared dead on scene. Damages in China amounted to ¥7.45billion ($1billion USD).|$|E
5|$|Ancient Greek mythology {{contains}} several precursors {{to modern}} vampires, though none were considered undead; these included the Empusa, Lamia, and striges (the strix of Ancient Roman mythology). Over time {{the first two}} terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa {{was the daughter of}} the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic, bronze-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood. Lamia was the daughter of King Belus and a secret lover of Zeus. However Zeus' wife Hera discovered this infidelity and killed all Lamia's offspring; Lamia swore vengeance and preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood. Like Lamia, the striges feasted on children, but also preyed on young men. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as strix, a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on human flesh and blood. The Romanian vampire breed named Strigoï has no <b>direct</b> <b>relation</b> to the Greek striges, but was derived from the Roman term strix, as {{is the name of the}} Albanian Shtriga and the Slavic Strzyga, though myths about these creatures are more similar to their Slavic equivalents. Greek vampiric entities are seen once again in Homer's epic Odyssey. In Homer's tale, the undead are too insubstantial to be heard by the living and cannot communicate with them without drinking blood first. In the epic, when Odysseus journeyed into Hades, he was made to sacrifice a black ram and a black ewe so that the shades there could drink its blood and communicate.|$|E

25|$|In 1693, {{a part of}} the {{woodland}} adjoining the Ashdown Forest was felled {{to clear}} the grounds of the former house on the present site. The estate, which had once been part of a medieval deer park, later passed to other families and in 1766 the owner paid window tax on forty-one windows, making the Bower the fifth largest out of the 150 taxable residences in East Grinstead. It seems likely that the present Bower House, a Tudor farmhouse in the village of Hammerwood, is of no <b>direct</b> <b>relation.</b> There existed a previous building on the site of what was to become Hammerwood Lodge (foundations and walls in the west of the central block of the current house have been dated to pre-1792), and it would seem likely that this was the principal dwelling of the Bower.|$|E
25|$|Place {{cells were}} {{initially}} believed to fire in <b>direct</b> <b>relation</b> to simple sensory inputs, but recent {{studies suggest that}} {{this may not be}} the case. Place fields are usually unaffected by large sensory changes, like removing a landmark from an environment, but respond to subtle changes, like a change in color or shape of an object. This suggests that place cells respond to complex stimuli rather than simple individual sensory cues. According to a model known as the functional differentiation model, sensory information is processed in various cortical structures upstream of the hippocampus before actually reaching the structure, so that the information received by place cells is a compilation of different stimuli. Mechanisms required for memory consolidation affect place cell firing less than direct sensory input does, suggesting that it is primarily recent inputs that are retrieved during place coding.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of its first {{recorded}} appearance, Xu was already a powerful Yi state that was probably located in southeastern Shandong or northwestern Jiangsu. Besides this state, a number of small Xu enclaves existed in western Shandong. Like the Dongyi states at Pugu and Yan, Xu participated in the Rebellion of the Three Guards against the Duke of Zhou, although it had no known <b>direct</b> <b>relation</b> to the three competing parties. Ralph D. Sawyer speculates that Xu joined the rebels because it did not wanted to alienate its neighboring states that had co-founded the rebel alliance. The rebels eventually lost the war, and as result the Huai River valley was invaded and subjugated by the Zhou royal army in 1039 BC. To what extent Xu was also defeated during that campaign remains unclear; reports in the Zuo Zhuan and the Bamboo Annals make it likely that Xu forces continued to resist the implementation of Zhou power in southeastern Shandong. After the foundation of Lu, Xu and other Huaiyi statelets reportedly attacked the new Zhou state until Bo Qin defeated them. Afterwards, the Xu state appears to have been largely pacified and became a vassal of the Zhou dynasty. In this position, it was strongly influenced by the Zhou culture and also served as link to the dynasty's southernmost ally, Wu. Despite that, Xu remained somewhat defiant, and moved its core area further south into northern Anhui in order to escape the constant pressure from the Zhou dynasty in the north. The Xu enclaves in western Shandong even continued to openly resist, but most of them were destroyed by Lu and Song over time.|$|E

500|$|Risley's {{interpretation}} of the nasal index went beyond investigation of the two-race theory.

[...] Trautmann explains that Risley [...] "found a <b>direct</b> <b>relation</b> between the proportion of Aryan blood and the nasal index, along a gradient from the highest castes to the lowest.

[...] He also saw a linkage between the nasal index and {{the definition of a}} community as either a tribe or a Hindu caste and believed that the caste system had its basis in race rather than in occupation, saying [...] "community of race, and not, as has frequently been argued, community of function, is the real determining principle, the true causa causans, of the caste system." ...|$|E
500|$|P.T. was {{designed}} to take players {{at least a week}} to complete, and Kojima intended the puzzles to be very enigmatic and difficult. Despite this, a few gamers reportedly finished the game within hours after the release, surprising him. Kojima also intended for P.T. to be a mystery {{in order to make it}} a more frightening experience. There is little, if not cryptic, information given in the game on events that take place, and there are few clues as to how to solve the puzzles. He chose the corridor as the setting as opposed to [...] "a ruin" [...] because he wanted the teaser to emotionally affect the player regardless of [...] "cultural background". Kojima elaborated that P.T. and Silent Hills have no canonical and <b>direct</b> <b>relation,</b> and that Silent Hills would have been enhanced by elements that were never in P.T. He based his concept of P.T. on horror films and other media that he found frightening. When creating the game, Kojima refrained from using graphic violence to build up suspense, as he felt that too many horror games rely on the trope. He wanted to elicit a more [...] "genuine, thoughtful and permeating" [...] type of fear.|$|E

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the learnability of auditory icons, that is, environmental sounds that refer {{either directly or}} indirectly to meaningful events. <b>Direct</b> <b>relations</b> use the sound made by the target event whereas indirect relations substitute a surrogate for the target.

500|$|Meanwhile, {{the cult}} of Osiris was {{becoming}} more important with this god replacing the king as the guarantor of life after death for the pharaoh's subjects. The German Egyptologist Hartwig Altenmüller writes that for an Egyptian of the time [...] "the [...] afterlife no longer depends {{on the relationship between}} the individual mortal and the king, [...] instead it is linked to his ethical position in <b>direct</b> <b>relation</b> to Osiris". In contrast, {{the cult of}} the sun god Ra was in apparent decline, even though Ra was still the most important deity of the Egyptian pantheon. Thus, Djedkare Isesi and Unas did not build a sun temple in contrast with most of their Fifth Dynasty predecessors. In addition, the names of Menkauhor Kaiu and Unas do not incorporate any reference to Ra, in rupture with a tradition which held since the reign of Userkaf, about a century earlier. The Pyramid Texts found in Unas' pyramid demonstrate the importance of Osiris and Ra in ancient Egyptian religion at the time. Both gods were believed to play the key roles in accessing the afterlife, with Ra as the source of life and Osiris as the force through which the next life would be attained.|$|E
500|$|Mileena {{appeared}} in the 1999 episode [...] "Shadow of a Doubt" [...] of the television series , {{in which she had}} no <b>direct</b> <b>relation</b> to Kitana and was here depicted as an initially very repulsive and aggressive Outworld warrior sent by Shao Kahn to assassinate the weakened Kung Lao, with a magic spell placed over her to give her Kitana's look (for a while, he even called her his [...] "new daughter"). Mileena, wearing a green costume, succeeded in seducing Kung Lao, but could not bring herself to kill him during their night of passion and was also explicitly warned by Shang Tsung to not do it. She makes excuses for Kahn and later fights an inconclusive duel against Kitana, broken by Shao Kahn. As punishment for her taking too much time in her mission, Kahn allows Mileena to keep her beauty with the exception of making her teeth exaggeratedly pointed. She then starts to wear her signature mask, which Kahn gives her before banishing her from his sight. In Konquest, Mileena was portrayed by Meg Brown and Audie England played Mileena pretending to be Kitana. Brown said she liked her sexy Mileena costume so much that she asked to be let [...] "wear the outfit home for her boyfriend." ...|$|E
500|$|Francis Bacon (no <b>direct</b> <b>relation</b> to Roger, {{who lived}} 300 years earlier) was a seminal figure in {{philosophy}} {{of science at}} the time of the Scientific Revolution. In his work Novum Organum (1620) – a reference to Aristotle's Organon – Bacon outlined a new system of logic to improve upon the old philosophical process of syllogism. Bacon's method relied on experimental histories to eliminate alternative theories. In 1637, René Descartes established a new framework for grounding scientific knowledge in his treatise, Discourse on Method, advocating the central role of reason as opposed to sensory experience. By contrast, in 1713, the 2nd edition of Isaac Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica argued that [...] "...hypotheses... have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy propositions are deduced from the phenomena and rendered general by induction. [...] " [...] This passage influenced a [...] "later generation of philosophically-inclined readers to pronounce a ban on causal hypotheses in natural philosophy." [...] In particular, later in the 18th century, David Hume would famously articulate skepticism about the ability of science to determine causality and gave a definitive formulation of the problem of induction. [...] The 19th century writings of John Stuart Mill are also considered important in the formation of current conceptions of the scientific method, as well as anticipating later accounts of scientific explanation.|$|E

500|$|Until the 1960s, the New Jersey Senate had 21 representatives, {{one from}} each county {{regardless}} of population. In {{the wake of}} the 1964 decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in Reynolds v.

The senate enacted a proposal whereby each senator's vote would be weighted based on the population of the county represented, [...] under which Cape May County's senator would receive one vote while the senator from Essex County would receive 19.1, in <b>direct</b> <b>relation</b> to the ratio of residents between counties.
