50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of piezoelectric sensors {{is that they}} cannot be used for truly static measurements. A static force results in a fixed amount of charge on the piezoelectric material. In conventional readout electronics, imperfect insulating materials and reduction in <b>internal</b> <b>sensor</b> resistance causes a constant loss of electrons and yields a decreasing signal. Elevated temperatures cause an additional drop in internal resistance and sensitivity. The main effect on the piezoelectric effect is that with increasing pressure loads and temperature, the sensitivity reduces due to twin formation. While quartz sensors must be cooled during measurements at temperatures above 300 °C, special types of crystals like GaPO4 gallium phosphate show no twin formation up to the melting point of the material itself.|$|E

30|$|To reduce {{motion blur}} {{resulting}} from camera shake, {{a large number}} of digital cameras with camera-shake reduction systems have been developed that can stabilize input images by shifting their optical systems mechanically. These image stabilization systems are categorized into two types according to the approach that is applied: the lens-shift approach, which shifts a floating lens to move the optical axis [11, 12] and the sensor-shift approach, which shifts the image sensor [13]. These image stabilizers can stabilize input images by controlling the optical path with a floating lens or the position of the image sensor with the camera’s <b>internal</b> <b>sensors,</b> such as its gyro sensor. The camera-shake reduction system is a camera-stabilization approach that uses the camera <b>internal</b> <b>sensors</b> for reducing motion blur resulting from camera shake; it is unsuitable for shooting blur-free images of fast moving scenes when the camera is fixed, because the <b>internal</b> <b>sensors</b> cannot detect any apparent motion in the captured images.|$|R

At a practical level, direct monitoring can be implemented using external or <b>internal</b> <b>sensors.</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>sensors</b> provide advantages with respect to reliability, completeness, timeliness and volume of data, in addition to efficiency and resistance against attacks. ^ We introduce an architecture called ESP {{as a framework for}} building intrusion detection systems based on <b>internal</b> <b>sensors.</b> We describe in detail a prototype implementation based on the ESP architecture and introduce {{the concept of}} embedded detectors as a mechanism for localized data reduction. ^ We show {{that it is possible to}} build both specific (specialized for a certain intrusion) and generic (able to detect different types of intrusions) detectors. Furthermore, we provide information about the types of data and places of implementation that are most effective in detecting different types of attacks. ^ Finally, performance testing of the ESP implementation shows the impact that embedded detectors can have on a computer system. Detection testing shows that embedded detectors have the capability of detecting a significant percentage of new attacks. ...|$|R

30|$|Mobile robots {{are widely}} used indoor for {{building}} security, cleaning, automatic guided vehicle system and so on. For autonomous robots, self-localization {{is one of the}} essential function to achieve tasks autonomously. While there are needs for inexpensive robots without precise self-localization, they are generally expensive because of the excessively accurate sensing. To make indoor autonomous robots inexpensive, it is essential to develop the self-localization method which does not require expensive sensor or processor and have just enough accuracy. Conventional self-localization methods are divided mainly into two approaches: the methods which use internal information and the methods which use external information of the robot. Internal information of the robot is measured by <b>internal</b> <b>sensors</b> such as rotary encoders or accelerometers equipped on the robot [1]. The self-localization using these <b>internal</b> <b>sensors</b> requires relatively low-calculation cost, as the self-localization using these sensors are merely the accumulation of the information, such as wheel rotation obtained from rotary encoders or accelerations measured by accelerometer. Moreover, the <b>internal</b> <b>sensors</b> and the processor used for self-localization are generally inexpensive. However, once the error, such as bias of the measurement or slip of the robot, was accumulated, it cannot be detected and the estimation error piles up. Sometimes the error would be fatal as the robot cannot reach to the destination or crashes into a facility. While <b>internal</b> <b>sensors</b> are low-cost, external information are usually measured by laser range finder [2], camera [3], ultrasonic range sensor [4] and microphones [5]. With the external information from laser range finder or camera, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm provides robust self-localization results as it integrates the external information of the robot [6]. However, these sensors are generally expensive and there are much more information to be processed than the <b>internal</b> <b>sensors</b> so {{that it is hard to}} be implemented on a low-cost processors, such as microcontrollers. Even if the sensor itself was inexpensive, the extraction of the feature from the obtained data such as image is costly calculation or otherwise the localization need to be achieved by monte-carlo method which requires much memory and calculation cost than simple Kalman filtering [7]. Because of these reasons, most of the self-localization methods with external information require high investment for sensors and computers. However, suitable self-localization method which does not require expensive sensor or processor and does not accumulate the error over time have not been realized.|$|R

30|$|Recently, dead-reckoning using <b>internal</b> <b>sensors</b> to {{estimate}} motion activities attracts {{a lot of}} research interests. For example, Strapdown Inertial Navigation System (SINS) [51] and Pedometer System [52] use MEMS {{to estimate}} the moving speed and trace. The key issue is to deal with noise of <b>internal</b> <b>sensors,</b> and the accumulated errors, which sometimes grow cubically [53]. Personal Dead-reckoning (PDR) system [11] uses “zero velocity update” to calibrate the drift. The majority of the dead-reckoning results focus on walking estimation, such as UnLoc [18] and CompAcc [17]. They mainly use an accelerometer to estimate the number of steps and then measure the distance through estimated step length. AutoWitness [13] is a system with an embedded wireless tag integrated with vibration sensors, accelerometer, and gyroscope. The tag is attached to a vehicle, and accelerometer and gyroscope are used to track the moving trace.|$|R
