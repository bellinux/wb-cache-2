5|$|The Australian {{public was}} shocked by the revelation by a turncoat Russian officer, who claimed that a direct {{engagement}} was secretly planned by Russia in case the Confederacy was recognised by Britain. The Russian navy had just paid Australia a visit in preparation <b>for</b> <b>launching</b> attacks. Fear of a possible military confrontation led to a massive buildup of coastal defences and to the acquisition of an ironclad warship.|$|E
5|$|The Youngstown Ohio Works {{baseball}} team {{was a minor}} league club that was known for winning the premier championship of the Ohio–Pennsylvania League in 1905, and <b>for</b> <b>launching</b> the professional career of pitcher Roy Castleton a year later. A training ground for several players and officials who later established careers in Major League Baseball, the team proved a formidable regional competitor and also won the 1906 league championship.|$|E
5|$|During the {{artillery}} barrage {{that preceded the}} infantry assault, Longstreet began to agonize over an assault {{that was going to}} cost dearly. He attempted to pass the responsibility <b>for</b> <b>launching</b> Pickett's division to his artillery chief, Col. Edward Porter Alexander. When the time came to actually order Pickett forward, Longstreet could only nod in assent, unable to verbalize the order. The assault, known as Pickett's Charge, suffered the heavy casualties that Longstreet anticipated. It was the decisive point in the Confederate loss at Gettysburg and Lee ordered a retreat back to Virginia the following day.|$|E

5|$|The Harrier GR.1 {{made its}} first flight on 28 December 1967. It officially entered service with the RAF on 18 April 1969 when the Harrier Conversion Unit at RAF Wittering {{received}} its first aircraft. The aircraft were built in two factories—one in Kingston upon Thames, southwest London, and the other at Dunsfold Aerodrome, Surrey—and underwent initial testing at Dunsfold. The ski-jump technique <b>for</b> <b>launching</b> Harriers from Royal Navy aircraft carriers was extensively trialled at RNAS Yeovilton from 1977. Following these tests ski-jumps {{were added to the}} flight decks of all RN carriers from 1979 onwards, in preparation for the new variant for the navy, the Sea Harrier.|$|E
5|$|Although three launch battalions {{were formed}} by the Germans in late 1943, they never {{got the chance to}} deploy to the V-weapons launch sites at Watten and Wizernes. On 3 July 1944, the Oberkommando West {{authorised}} the cessation of construction at the heavily damaged sites. On 18 July 1944, Hitler abandoned plans <b>for</b> <b>launching</b> V-2s from bunkers and authorized the downgrading of the Wizernes bunker to make it a LOX production facility. However, these plans were overtaken by the Allied liberation of Northern France following the Normandy landings. The site was finally abandoned {{a few days before the}} Allies reached it at the start of September during the rapid liberation of the area by British, American, Canadian and Polish troops. British engineers inspected it on 5 September.|$|E
5|$|Condor {{was ordered}} as a {{replacement}} for the gunboat , which had been sunk by the hurricane that hit Apia in 1889. She was laid down at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg in 1891. An outbreak of Cholera in Hamburg made work on the ship difficult, but the completed hull was nevertheless ready <b>for</b> <b>launching</b> as scheduled, on 23 February 1892. Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Wilhelm Schröder, the Chief of the Baltic Station, gave the speech at her launching, and she was christened by Kapitän zur See (Captain at Sea) von Bodenhausen, the director of the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Dockyard) in Wilhelmshaven. The ship accidentally launched itself due to the tide coming earlier than expected. She was completed on 9 December of that year, when she was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy; precautions against cholera delayed the beginning of sea trials until 15 December.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to deceiving the French, the Rwandan government used the fake attack on Kigali on 4 October as the pretext <b>for</b> <b>launching</b> {{a wave of}} anti-Tutsi propaganda. They encouraged Hutu citizens to arrest Tutsi suspected of supporting the RPF. With French assistance, and benefiting {{from the loss of}} RPF morale after Rwigyema's death, the FAR enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF, and pushed the rebels {{all the way back to}} the Ugandan border. Many soldiers deserted; some crossed back into Uganda, while others went into hiding in the Akagera National Park. The Rwandan government announced on 30 October that the war was over.|$|E
5|$|On 30 October 1918, {{towards the}} end of World War I, the Sharifian Army led by Emir Faisal, backed by the British Army, {{captured}} Damascus from the Ottomans as part of the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. The war ended {{less than a month after}} the Sharifian–British conquest of Damascus. In correspondences between the Sharifian leadership in Mecca and Henry McMahon, the British high commissioner in Cairo, the latter promised to support the establishment of a Sharifian kingdom in the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire in return <b>for</b> <b>launching</b> a revolt against the Ottomans. However, the British and French governments secretly made previous arrangements regarding the division of the Ottomans' Arab provinces between themselves in the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement.|$|E
5|$|Petr Veliky {{was built}} by the {{state-owned}} Galernii Island Shipyard in Saint Petersburg. Construction began on 1 June 1869, although her keel was not laid down until 23 July 1870. The ship was launched on 27 August 1872, and entered service with the Baltic Fleet on 14 October 1876. She cost a then-staggering sum of over {{five and a half}} million rubles. Two 9-inch mortars were fitted on her quarterdeck during the war scare with Britain during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, but they were removed in 1880 without ever having been used in combat. Two frames <b>for</b> <b>launching</b> Whitehead torpedoes were added to the ship's sides in that same year, but they proved ineffective.|$|E

5|$|The player flies {{around in}} a fighter with a first-person, in-cockpit view with a fully {{customizable}} fixed head-up display (HUD) as the visual interface. The HUD displays video communications and relevant data on the ship's status and performance, weapons, objectives, and targets. It can also warn players from which direction missiles are locking onto them from, thus becoming an aide <b>for</b> <b>launching</b> countermeasures or taking evasive maneuvers. Players have to maneuver into position and shoot through both shields and hull to destroy enemy ships. While hull damage is unrecoverable, shields recharge over time. With the game supporting force feedback technology, joystick players will find their controllers vibrating or putting up resistance when they engage the afterburners or collide with objects. Similarly, certain events, such as engaging afterburners and firing powerful weapons, will shake the screen {{as a form of}} visual feedback.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Bellerophon was launched, {{there was no}} {{pressing}} need for new warships. The signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783 brought the American War of Independence to an end while Bellerophon was still under construction. Though Greaves had been contracted to have her ready <b>for</b> <b>launching</b> by April 1784, she spent another two years on the slipway, probably because the Navy Board ordered construction work to be delayed to allow her timber to be seasoned, a luxury available now {{that there were no}} pressing military needs. When the launch came, it was delayed several times, finally taking place during a period of heavy autumn storms in October 1786. She was launched with little ceremony on 7 October 1786, by Commissioner Charles Proby, of Chatham Dockyard. She was then towed across the River Medway and anchored off Chatham Dockyard. She was taken into the dry dock there on 7 March 1787, where her hull was fitted with copper sheathing, and she was fitted for the Ordinary. Her final costs came to £30,232.14.4d paid to Greaves for building her, and a further £8,376.15.2d spent on fitting her for service.|$|E
5|$|During {{the ensuing}} German occupation, {{it became the}} command post for German forces in the Pas-de-Calais/Flanders region and was very heavily fortified, as it was {{generally}} believed by the Germans that the Allies would invade at that point. It was also used as a launch site for V1 flying bombs and {{for much of the}} war, the Germans used the region as the site for railway guns used to bombard the south-eastern corner of England. In 1943 they built massive bunkers along the coast in preparation <b>for</b> <b>launching</b> missiles on the southeast of England. Despite heavy preparations for defence against an amphibious assault, the Allied invasion took place well to the west in Normandy on D-Day. Calais was very heavily bombed and shelled in a successful effort to disrupt German communications and persuade them that the Allies would target the Pas-de-Calais for invasion (rather than Normandy). The town, by then largely in ruins, was liberated by General Daniel Spry's 3rd Canadian Infantry Division between 25 September and 1 October 1944. On 27 February 1945 Calais suffered a last bombing raid—this time by British bombers who mistook the town for Dunkirk, which was at that time still occupied by German forces. After the war there was little rebuilding of the historic city and most buildings were modern ones.|$|E

5|$|In February 2016, the {{conservative}} {{majority in the}} Regional Council of Réunion with president Didier Robert announced plans to transform the national park into a regional nature park. Too restrictive rules, which hindered tourism development, was cited as a motive. A regional nature park, unlike a national park, functions {{on the basis of}} mutual agreements and has no power to establish its own regulations. Park officials and opposition politicians rejected the plan, saying it would threaten the island's biodiversity, the World Heritage listing, and critical access to state funding. It would be the first case of a national park in France being downgraded. In September 2016, the national park's director, Marylène Hoarau, announced her withdrawal upon pressure from Ségolène Royal, head of the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy. This led the park's president, Daniel Gonthier, to suspect political interference; Hoarau had criticised Robert <b>for</b> <b>launching</b> a call for proposals {{on the future of the}} park. In an interview,Robert denied involvement in Hoarau's departure and criticised the minister for her decision.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 2–3 June 1969, Melbourne and her escorts were {{involved}} in anti-submarine training exercises in the South China Sea. In preparation <b>for</b> <b>launching</b> a Tracker, Stevenson ordered Evans to the plane guard station, reminded the destroyer of Melbournes course, and instructed the carrier's navigational lights {{to be brought to}} full brilliance. Evans had performed the manoeuvre four times {{over the course of the}} night. Evans was positioned on Melbournes port bow, but began the manoeuvre by turning starboard, towards the carrier. A radio message was sent from Melbourne to Evans bridge and Combat Information Centre, warning the destroyer that she was on a collision course, which Evans acknowledged. Seeing the destroyer take no action and on a course to place herself under Melbournes bow, Stevenson ordered the carrier hard to port, signalling the turn by both radio and siren blasts. At approximately the same time, Evans turned hard to starboard to avoid the approaching carrier. It is uncertain which ship began to manoeuvre first, but each ship's bridge crew claimed that they were informed of the other ship's turn after they commenced their own. After having narrowly passed in front of Melbourne, the turns quickly placed Evans back in the carrier's path. Melbourne hit Evans amidships at 3:15am, cutting the destroyer in two.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} a city on the planet Efate. Here, as on all explorable planets in this game, the player observes the party and its {{surroundings}} from a directly overhead {{point of view and}} issues commands via hotkeys or clickable icons displayed onscreen. The explorable terrain of planets is limited to certain cities and immediately adjacent regions. Cities feature several types of buildings that are a recurrent feature on most planets, including a store for purchasing or selling armor, weapons and other items, a library, hospital, police station, and a starport <b>for</b> <b>launching</b> and outfitting a spaceship. Some cities host additional visitable buildings which may include a tavern or a hotel in which important non-player characters are located. Building types are color-coded for easier player identification. The player directs the party's movements and issues commands to perform various actions such as communicating with non-player characters, using objects or firing a weapon. Combat takes place in real-time and requires the player to direct individual party members to target opponents and fire their weapons, reload, or move to a better position.|$|E
