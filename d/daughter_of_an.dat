5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the last half of the twelfth century, Haraldr put aside his first wife, a <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it may well have been through Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that she passed to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E

50|$|One {{does not}} gain {{precedence}} as <b>a</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lady, unless that lady is <b>a</b> member <b>of</b> {{the royal family}} or is a peer in her own right. Furthermore, if <b>a</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> peer marries a commoner, then she retains her precedence as <b>a</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> peer. However, if she marries a peer, then her precedence is based on her husband's status, and not on her father's.|$|R

5|$|Marquis {{was born}} December 19, 1869, {{on a farm}} near Osceola, Missouri. The family surname came from French {{ancestors}} who had been granted the hereditary title of Marquis. Marquis' great-great-grandfather was disinherited around 1768 for marrying beneath his station, to the <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> English merchant. With no prospects in France, he emigrated to Virginia, where he took Marquis as a surname.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 1564 Knox stirred {{controversy}} again, when {{he married}} Margaret Stewart, the <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old friend, Andrew Stewart, 2nd Lord Ochiltree, {{a member of the}} Stuart family and a distant relative of the Queen, Mary Stuart. The marriage was unusual because he was a widower of fifty, while the bride was only seventeen. Very few details are known of their domestic life. They had three daughters, Martha, Margaret, and Elizabeth.|$|E
5|$|The Blaj-based Făgăraș and Alba Iulia Archdiocese {{arranged}} for Agârbiceanu {{to study at}} the theology faculty of Budapest University between 1900 and 1904. Publishing more works in Tribuna and Familia, he soon became {{a regular contributor to}} Luceafărul. Returning to Blaj after graduation, he supervised the local boys' boarding school, working there during the 1904–1905 academic year. Urged by friends and receiving a church scholarship, he returned to Budapest to study literature. He spent just one semester there, during which he also taught primary school catechism. In March 1906, he married Maria Reli Radu, the <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> archpriest from Ocna Mureș.|$|E

5|$|To help {{publicize}} the production, Ince {{reported to the}} newspapers that lead-actress Tsuru Aoki {{was a native of}} the island of Sakura and she had lost all her relatives in the eruption—she was actually from Obara Tsuru city, Kyushu, 180 miles north of Sakura-Jima. Ince also embroidered her biography so that she would appeal to the middle-class audiences as the heroine of a melodrama, claiming that she was the <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> illustrious Japanese artist. The biographical-type publicity added emotional and psychological authenticity to the character that Aoki played in the film.|$|E
5|$|William Shakespeare {{was the son}} of John Shakespeare, an {{alderman}} and {{a successful}} glover originally from Snitterfield, and Mary Arden, the <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> affluent landowning farmer. He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564. His actual date of birth remains unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George's Day. This date, which {{can be traced back to}} an 18th-century scholar's mistake, has proved appealing to biographers because Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616. He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son.|$|E
5|$|According to Njáls saga, Gilli {{was seated}} on Kola or Kolu, an island {{that appears to}} refer to Coll or perhaps Colonsay. The saga also states that Gilli was married to Sigurðr's sister, Hvarflǫð. This marital {{alliance}} appears to further evince the southward extension of Sigurðr's influence. This union, along with the record of apparent amiable dealings with Sigurðr's associates, suggests that Gilli and Sigurðr indeed enjoyed close relations. The earl's family was clearly not adverse to marrying into native dynasties, as Sigurðr's own mother was the <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Irish king, whilst his wife {{was the daughter of}} a Scottish king. In fact, the aforesaid sources appear to indicate that Gilli operated in the Hebrides as a tributary earl to his brother-in-law. Certainly, Eyrbyggja saga states that Sigurðr left menn ("agents") in the Hebrides to collect tax from Mann, whilst Orkneyinga saga reveals that, at a later period in time, Sigurðr's son and successor, Þórfinnr Sigurðarson, Earl of Orkney (died c. 1065), tasked a member of his own wife's family, Kálfr Árnason (died 1051), to impose Orcadian authority in the Isles.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the most}} famous anti-Tom books are The Sword and the Distaff by William Gilmore Simms, Aunt Phillis's Cabin by Mary Henderson Eastman, and The Planter's Northern Bride by Caroline Lee Hentz, with the last author having been a close {{personal}} friend of Stowe's when the two lived in Cincinnati. Simms' book was published {{a few months after}} Stowe's novel, and it contains a number of sections and discussions disputing Stowe's book and her view of slavery. Hentz's 1854 novel, widely read at the time but now largely forgotten, offers a defense of slavery as seen {{through the eyes of a}} northern woman—the <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> abolitionist, no less—who marries a southern slave owner.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{majority}} of the Royal Navy, Balchen was placed in reserve at the war's conclusion and returned to England to await further deployment. Whilst there, he married Susannah Apreece, <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> army colonel. The marriage produced six children, two of whom survived into adulthood; Frances, who later married Temple West (Vice Admiral Temple West) and George, who followed his father into the Navy. In 1701, Balchen was again at sea, commanding the small fireships HMS Firebrand and then HMS Vulcan with Sir George Rooke's fleet off the Spanish coast at the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession. He was probably engaged during the Battle of Vigo Bay in 1702, where Rooke's fleet captured a Spanish treasure fleet and was instrumental in the capture of the 56-gun Modéré, which he went on to briefly command as HMS Modéré.|$|E
5|$|Fakih {{was born}} in Gresik, East Java, Dutch East Indies, on 2 March 1904. His father, Usman Iskandar, was a wood merchant, and his mother, a housewife, was the <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ulama (scholar of Islam). The couple, who were of modest means, had four other children, and the family's lack of a noble {{background}} meant the children were ineligible to receive an education at Dutch-run schools. Instead, Fakih studied Islam from a young age, receiving much of his instruction from his father. At the age of ten he began studying at a pesantren (Islamic boarding school) in Gresik, finishing four years later. In 1919 he continued his studies at several pesantren outside the city, including ones in rural Gresik and in nearby Bungah.|$|E
