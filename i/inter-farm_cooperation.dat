40|$|Since the {{economic}} crisis following {{the collapse of the}} Soviet Union, Cuba has restructured their agriculture with a greater focus on domestic production of domestically consumed produce, and a dramatic reduction of petroleum products in all aspects of food production. This overhaul has included the broad application of what is termed agroecology – agricultural practices which focus on principles of biodiversity and sustainability – and <b>inter-farm</b> <b>cooperation</b> facilitated by the National Association of Small Farmers (ANAP) and Campesino a Campesino. Academics and journalists from within and abroad have critically examined aspects of the novel reforms developed in the country in starkly contrasting terms, as either an impressive example of sustainability in farming meeting human needs, or as an inefficient, bureaucratically bloated attempt to cope with an enduring food crisis in the country. This author speculates that both perspectives have political agendas unrelated to the observable successes or failures of food production in Cuba. The challenge is in finding the common ground between these poles of argument to clarify how Cuba’s agricultural system has shown remarkable success in recovery from crisis, and in modeling sustainable agriculture; and how it is impeded from further success by circumstances such as governmental bureaucracy, social prejudice, and insufficient profit for farmers with which to motivate ingenuity. While both perspectives can provide insight into food production in Cuba, the context of the broader political debate is present in the data and arguments of both critics and proponents of sustainable agriculture in Cuba...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} {{a part of}} the intellectual legacy of the Chayanov’s school that is often con-sidered as consisting exclusively of the studies of peasant economy and its cooperative development. Such an interpretation overlooks the school’s contribution to the study of large-scale agrarian production within the establishing soviet system of collective farms. The authors provide another interpretation of the intellectual legacy of Chayanov and his colleagues, and focus on the works of A. N. Chelintsev (1874 - 1962) and N. P. Makarov (1888 - 1980), who survived the repressions of the 1930 s and since the 1940 s returned to the studies of economic organization of collective farms, which had become the main insti-tutional form of the soviet agrarian system. Chelintsev studied lagging collective farms, which were un-popular and even dangerous subject in the soviet agrarian science. Chelintsev’s recommendations were not followed in the collective farms’ economy of the 1950 s. However, today they help to understand some system features of weak collective farms. Makarov summarized the results of his collective farms studies at the rise of the Kosygin’s reforms in the monograph published in 1966; it emphasized both the importance of collective farms in the soviet agriculture and alternative strategies of collective farms develop-ment by granting them more independence and involving in <b>inter-farm</b> <b>cooperation.</b> With such works, Chelintsev and Makarov ensured the highest methodological level of social-economic research typical for the 1920 s’ soviet agrarian science, thus confirming that the Chayanov’s school introduced many original ideas in the study of peculiarities of the economic organization of both peasant households and large-scale collective farms, which determines the necessity of reevaluating the intellectual legacy of the organizational-production school to understand better the phenomenon of Russian collective farming in the XX century...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Since 2006, several {{varieties}} of transgenic Bt-maize are approved for commercial cultivation in Germany. The German {{regulatory framework for}} growing these crops comprises ex-ante regulations as well as ex-post liability rules to protect conventional and organic farming from possible negative side effects of transgenic plants and to ensure co-existence. Public regulation is also suspected to impose additional costs to those farmers who intend to plant Bt-maize. We address the question how Bt-maize growing farmers perceive the additional costs of regulation and whether coordination or cooperation takes place in order to diminish these costs. In 2006, we carried out {{a case study in}} the Oderbruch region (Brandenburg, Germany) comprising eight Bt-maize growing farmers and six adjacent neighbours. The predominantly large farms chose intra-farm coordination to manage the construction of buffer zones within their own fields and to avoid the planting of Bt-maize close to their neighbours. <b>Inter-farm</b> coordination or <b>cooperation</b> with adjacent farmers was not regarded necessary to achieve co-existence...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Since 2006, several {{varieties}} of transgenic Bt maize {{have been approved}} for commercial cultivation in Germany. The German regulatory framework for growing these crops comprises moderate ex-ante regulations as well as strict ex-post liability rules to protect conventional and organic farming from possible economic damages caused by transgenic plants and to ensure coexistence. These regulations, however, impose additional costs on those farmers who intend to plant Bt maize. This article addresses {{the question of how}} Bt maize-growing farmers perceive the additional costs of regulation and whether coordination or cooperation takes place in order to diminish these costs. In 2006, the authors carried out a case study in the Oderbruch region (Brandenburg, Germany) comprised of eight Bt maize farms and six adjacent non-Bt maize farms. The case study revealed that the costs arising from ex-ante regulations and ex-post liability were only of minor importance to the Bt maize-growing farmers. The predominantly large farms chose intra-farm coordination to manage the construction of buffer zones within their own fields and to avoid the planting of Bt maize close to their neighbors. <b>Inter-farm</b> coordination or <b>cooperation</b> with adjacent farmers was not regarded as necessary to achieve coexistence...|$|R
40|$|The {{regulatory}} framework for growing GM crops in Germany comprises quite liberal ex-ante regulations with very strict ex-post liability rules to protect other production forms from possible negative side effects of transgenic plants. Regulation is assumed to impose additional costs on farmers who intend to plant Bt-maize. This paper investigates {{the significance of these}} costs and the possibility of minimizing them by farm-level strategies such as coordination and cooperation between the Bt-maize growing farmer and his neighbours. A case study investigating the behaviour of Bt-maize growing farmers was carried out in the Oderbruch region in the federal state of Brandenburg, Germany. This region is leading in Bt-maize cultivation in Germany and has a high incidence of the European Corn Borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hübner). The interviews revealed that additional costs due to ex-ante regulation and ex-post liability were only of minor importance to the Bt-maize growing farmers. All farms were large-scale and could easily manage the construction of buffer zones within their own fields and deliberately avoided the planting of Bt-maize close to their neighbours. Thus advanced <b>inter-farm</b> coordination and <b>cooperation</b> was not necessary to achieve coexistence. However, the fact that Bt-maize was only grown on large-scale farms indicates a significant threshold effect due to the {{regulatory framework}} in Germany likely to prevent small-scale farms from planting Bt-maize unless innovative farm-level strategies of coexistence will be developed. coexistence, ex-ante regulation and ex-post liability, Germany, Agricultural and Food Policy, Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R
