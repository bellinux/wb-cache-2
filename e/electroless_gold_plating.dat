40|$|Gold {{nanoparticles}} {{are ideal}} candidates for clinical applications if their plasmon absorption band {{is situated in}} the near infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Various parameters, including the nanoparticle shape, strongly influence the position of this absorption band. The {{aim of this study}} is to produce stabilized NIR absorbing branched gold nanoparticles with potential for biomedical applications. Hereto, the synthesis procedure for branched gold nanoparticles is optimized varying the different synthesis parameters. By subsequent <b>electroless</b> <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> the plasmon absorption band is shifted to 747. 2 nm. The intrinsic unstable nature of the nanoparticles’ morphology can be clearly observed by a spectral shift and limits their use in real applications. However, in this article we show how the stabilization of the branched structure can be successfully achieved by exchanging the initial capping agent for different alkanethiols and disulfides. Furthermore, when using alkanethiols/disulfides with poly(ethylene oxide) units incorporated, an increased stability of the gold nanoparticles is achieved in high salt concentrations up to 1 M and in cell culture medium. These achievements open a plethora of opportunities for these stabilized branched gold nanoparticles in nanomedicine. status: publishe...|$|E

It was shown that gold reduction with hypophosphite dissolved in the solution or with nickel and copper from the substrate {{is accompanied by}} the side {{processes of}} Ni or Cu dissolution owing to the reduction of hydrogen ions or the dissolved oxygen.

40|$|The {{thickness}} of the gold film and its morphology, including the surface roughness, are very important for getting a good, reproducible response in the SPR technique. Here, we report a novel alternative approach for preparing SPR-active substrates that is completely solution-based. Our strategy is based on self-assembly of the gold colloid monolayer on a (3 -aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane-modified glass slide, followed by <b>electroless</b> <b>gold</b> <b>plating.</b> Using this method, the {{thickness of}} films can be easily controlled at the nanometer scale by setting the plating time in the same conditions. Surface roughness and morphology of gold films can be modified by both tuning the size of gold nanoparticles and agitation during the plating. Surface evolution of the Au film was followed in real time by UV-vis spectroscopy and in situ SPRS. To assess the surface roughness and electrochemical stability of the Au films, atomic force microscopy and cyclic voltammetry were used. In addition, {{the stability of the}} gold adhesion is demonstrated by three methods. The as-prepared Au films on substrates are reproducible and stable, which allows them to be used as electrodes for electrochemical experiments and as platforms for studying SAMs. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In {{the modern}} world {{electronic}} devices are expected to function in extreme environments, survive rapid changes in temperature and endure repeated mechanical stress. These conditions put enormous strain on solder joints and can result in fatigue and mechanical failures. One approach to overcoming these problems {{is the development of}} composite solders, for example, the dispersion of inert particles into the solder matrix. These particles can modify the grain structure to prevent ‘slippage’ between grain boundaries, inhibit crack propagation and obstruct dislocation movement. This approach does, however, suffer from the issue of how to incorporate the inert species into the solder matrix. Kings College London are developing a process whereby silica nanoparticles are coated with a nanogold ‘shell’ and then integrated into the solder during reflow. The plating process consists of: • Coating the silica nanoparticles with an amine containing ‘linker’ • Dispersing gold nanoparticles on to the silica to act as nucleation sites for the next stage. • <b>Electroless</b> <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> to from a ‘nanoshell’ Some success has been achieved with this process but incomplete plating of the particles has occurred due to issues such as agglomeration, and obtaining an even distribution of the gold nucleation sites across the silica nanoparticles. Ultrasonic agitation is well known to improve mass transport, is excellent at dispersing materials in solution and can prevent agglomeration. For this reason the Sonochemistry Centre at Coventry University has worked with KCL to investigate the use of ultrasonic agitation on this plating process. Initial results suggest that an improvement in the gold coverage of the silica nanoparticles can be achieved particularly when using high frequency ultrasonic agitation...|$|E
40|$|Advanced hybrid {{microelectronics}} require {{high performance}} packaging materials and components. Alumina, {{the most widely}} used ceramic material in microelectronics, is being replaced by new high performance materials such as aluminum nitride (AlN) and beryllia (BeO). AlN's thermal conductivity is an order of magnitude greater than alumina and it has a thermal expansion coefficient very close to silicon. Metallization is used to generate areas for wire and die bonding and to form corrosion barriers for underlying metals. Plating is one metallization process which immerses the component to be coated into a chemical medium. The plating baths usually operate at temperature greater than 70 °C and a pH greater than 12. Alumina is stable in this environment but AlN corrodes. An <b>electroless</b> <b>gold</b> gel <b>plating</b> process was developed which selectively plates specific areas of a surface without exposing the component to a corrosive environment. The developed process exhibits several advantages: selective area metallization, variable metal thickness on the same component, rework of defectively plated parts, reduction of waste produced during operation, optimal usage of <b>gold,</b> higher <b>plating</b> rates, and elimination of variation in the chemical composition during operation. An electroless plating gel was formulated using a modified commercial bath and a polymeric thickening agent. The relationship between gel processing and the resulting chemical and physical properties are discussed. The gel was transferred to the substrate in a defined pattern by a screen printer and then deposited in a chemical reactor. Several chemical reactors were fabricated to reduce the time required to obtain the operating temperature and decrease the drying rate during plating. The final reactor prototype increased the heating rate over five fold and decreased the drying rate by a factor of 4. Metallic impurity contamination was discovered in residual gel samples after plating. This caused non-uniform coatings and decreased the plating rate. A chelating agent was added to the electroless gel which complexed with the metal ions preventing them from interfering in the plating reactions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed the resulting <b>gold</b> <b>plate</b> was dense and uniform [...] Gold conversion efficiencies, the amount of <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> from the gel onto the substrate surface, were determined by DCP.

40|$|Reliability of plated {{packages}} after post plating processing steps such as die attach, glass bonding, and lid sealing can be {{a critical}} problem causing poor wetting of solder and loss of hermeticity. We have explored three different approaches to obtaining higher reliability gold platings on nickelhungsten and titanium metallization. These approaches included alloying of nickel and gold, alloying of nickel and cobalt, and discrete barrier layers of palladium or platinum.

40|$|In recent years, {{molecular}} transport through solid-state nanochannels mimicking selective transport {{properties of}} biological ion channels has attracted considerable attention. In both synthetic and biological channels, these properties strongly depend on size and surface charge. Especially, heavy ion track-etched nanochannels {{are widely used}} for selective transport and separation of molecules, including biomolecules. Up to now, surface charge manipulation of nanochannels, fabricated in polymer membranes, is mostly achieved by <b>electroless</b> <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> and subsequent chemisorption of thiomolecules having variable charge polarity [1]. In this report, we describe a facile and straightforward approach for the manipulation of surface charge of nanochannels in polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) membranes via carbodiimide chemistry (Figure 1) [2]. At about neutral pH, carboxyl (-COO-) groups which were generated during the track-etching process, import negative charge to the channel surface. After functionalization of these groups with ethylendiamine, the channel surface was positively charged due to protonation of terminal amino (-NH 3 +) groups. For the selective transport of charged biomolecules, the membranes with areal density of ~ 3 x 10 8 channels/cm 2 were used. The diameter (75 ± 4 nm) of cylindrical nanochannels was confirmed through FESEM images of gold nanowires deposited in these nanochannels. Charged protein molecules such as lysozyme and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were selected for masstransport experiments. Briefly, the membrane was mounted between {{the two halves of}} a conductivity cell.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the developments of guided-wave optical interconnects suitable for integration with printed circuit boards. The technology is based around direct laser writing of waveguides {{and other features}} in a newly developed multifunctional acrylate polymer system, using a He-Cd (325 nm) laser. It was demonstrated that, by writing with a laser spot having top-hat intensity profile, more sharply defined vertical and angled sidewalls could be achieved, compared to conventional methods using a Gaussian beam. Typical dimensions of the multimode waveguides were 50 x 50 J. lm, written with 50 J. lW of optical power with 100 J. lm/s scanning speed. The waveguide losses were measured, using the cut-back technique, to be - 0. 6 dB/em. A novel oil-immersion technique was developed to. overcome the limitations of refraction of the laser beam at the air / polymer inte~face and hence directly write 45 Ã‚Â° angled structures in the polymer. Metallised 45 Ã‚Â° out-of-plane mirrors were fabricated using these angled polymer structures and losses were measured to be ~ 0. 8 dB per reflection. Successful coupling of optical signals between waveguides in different layers was also demonstrated in a double layer structure, in which the out-ofplane 45 Ã‚Â° mirrors provided the necessary optical connectivity. Direct laser writing was also employed to fabricate ~ 50 J. lm wide and 100 J. lm high polymer bumps for use in flip-chip bonding. <b>Electroless</b> <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> was used to selectively metallise the polymer bumps and to produce electrical tracks on the substrate.

40|$|Gold is {{very likely}} the first metal {{discovered}} by man, more than 11 000 years ago. However, unlike copper (similar to 9000 BC), bronze (similar to 3500 BC), and wrought iron (similar to 2500 - 3000 BC), gold is too soft for fabrication of tools and weapons. Instead, it was used for decoration, religious artifacts, and commerce. The earliest documented inorganic thin films were gold layers, some less than 3000 angstrom thick, produced chemi-mechanically by Egyptians approximately 5000 years ago. Examples, gilded on statues and artifacts (requiring interfacial adhesion layers), were found in early stone pyramids dating to similar to 2650 BC in Saqqara, Egypt. Spectacular samples of embossed Au sheets date to at least 2600 BC. The Moche Indians of northern Peru developed <b>electroless</b> <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> (an auto-catalytic reaction) in similar to 100 BC and applied it to intricate Cu masks. The earliest published electroplating experiments were similar to 1800 AD, immediately following {{the invention of the}} dc electrochemical battery by Volta. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of metal films was reported in 1649, atmospheric arc deposition of oxides (Priestley) in the mid- 1760 s, and atmospheric plasmas (Siemens) in 1857. Sols were produced in the mid- 1850 s (Faraday) and sol-gel films synthesized in 1885. Vapor phase film growth including sputter deposition (Grove, 1852), vacuum arc deposition ("deflagration," Faraday, 1857), plasma-enhanced CVD (Barthelot, 1869) and evaporation (Stefan, Hertz, and Knudsen, 1873 - 1915) all had to wait for the invention of vacuum pumps whose history ranges from similar to 1650 for mechanical pumps, through similar to 1865 for mercury pumps that produce ballistic pressures in small systems. The development of crystallography, beginning with Plato in 360 BC, Kepler in 1611, and leading to Miller indices (1839) for describing orientation and epitaxial relationships in modern thin film technology, was already well advanced by the 1780 s (Hauy). The starting point for the development of heterogeneous thin film nucleation theory was provided by Young in 1805. While an historical timeline tracing the progress of thin film technology is interesting of itself, the stories behind these developments are even more fascinating and provide insight into the evolution of scientific reasoning.
