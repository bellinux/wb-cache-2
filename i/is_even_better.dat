25|$|Plots of {{the four}} results above in the ROC space are given in the figure. The result of method A clearly shows the best {{predictive}} power among A, B, and C. The result of B lies on the random guess line (the diagonal line), {{and it can be}} seen in the table that the accuracy of B is 50%. However, when C is mirrored across the center point (0.5,0.5), the resulting method C′ <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> than A. This mirrored method simply reverses the predictions of whatever method or test produced the C contingency table. Although the original C method has negative predictive power, simply reversing its decisions leads to a new predictive method C′ which has positive predictive power. When the C method predicts p or n, the C′ method would predict n or p, respectively. In this manner, the C′ test would perform the best. The closer a result from a contingency table is to the upper left corner, the better it predicts, but the distance from the random guess line in either direction is the best indicator of how much predictive power a method has. If the result is below the line (i.e. the method is worse than a random guess), all of the method's predictions must be reversed in order to utilize its power, thereby moving the result above the random guess line.|$|E

500|$|A UGO Networks {{columnist}} {{was concerned}} that the expensive pilot {{would be hard to}} translate into weekly episodes, but [...] "after sitting down to watch Fringes second episode, [...] "The Same Old Story", my concerns have vanished. Fringes second episode represents all that is holy about genre programming without sacrificing any of Fringes eleven-herbs and spices. In fact, the subtle framework of what makes Fringe not X-Files <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> defined in the first weekly-episode. I'd struggled to find the word to describe it, and the winner is 'condensed'. [...] "The Same Old Story" [...] has all of the sense of mystery, discovery, and humor that the pilot had just in a smaller, more combustible space." [...] Another UGO writer, Alex Zalben, later compared [...] "The Same Old Story" [...] to the similarly-plotted The X-Files episode [...] "Død Kalm". Zalben concluded that [...] "Fringe wins this one, just for having a slightly less stupid explanation." ...|$|E
500|$|At Metacritic, {{the first}} series {{received}} a generally favourable score of 66 out of 100 based on five critics. [...] As the series progressed reviews became slightly more positive with DVD Talk reviewer David Cornelius {{saying that the}} [...] "second series <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> than the first." [...] However Eric Profancik from DVD Verdict stated that the second series suffered from [...] "poor scripts and horrible acting", criticising it for having [...] "simple plots, too many conveniences and having corny humour." [...] Series three is described by Guy Clapperton of review site ScreenJabber.com as being slightly braver than its predecessors, while Bullz-eye.com described it as [...] "a sweet, fun little show, with some neat ideas" [...] with [...] "its heart {{very much in the}} right place." [...] Reviews for the final series were sympathetic for the series' end and the unavoidably incomplete nature of the series (following the death of Elisabeth Sladen) and its story arcs. Stephen Kelly from The Guardian said that it was [...] "a fitting tribute to Elisabeth Sladen" [...] and has occupied a [...] "unique place in the Whoniverse".|$|E

Kitty Empire of The Guardian noted that the songs on Rebel Heart with the word [...] "bitch" [...] in the title [...] "bode well", expressing that [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> than [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna", where [...] "Diplo lays Madonna down over some dancehall. Santigold was doing similar things in ’08, but the method remains sound." [...] Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club also noticed that it [...] "resembles watered-down Santigold." [...] Amy Pettifer of The Quietus applauded the line, [...] "you never really knew how much you loved me till you lost me", calling it [...] "the killer nugget of this track," [...] which she labelled [...] "icked good," [...] while Time's Jamieson Cox thought that it was [...] "fun to hear Madonna deliver a line like, 'It might sound like I’m an unapologetic bitch / but sometimes you know I gotta call I like it is' because she has three’ decades worth of unapologetic bitchiness in her back pocket. It’s an easy score, sure, but it’s effective." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it [...] "brilliant", while Lee DeVito [...] of Metro Times called it [...] "one of the more enjoyable tracks" [...] on the album.|$|E

2500|$|The hall {{is modeled}} on the second Gewandhaus concert hall in Leipzig, which was later {{destroyed}} in World War II. The Hall is relatively long, narrow, and high, in a rectangular [...] "shoebox" [...] shape like Amsterdam's Concertgebouw and Vienna's Musikverein. It is 18.6m high, 22.9m wide, and 38.1m long from the lower back wall {{to the front of}} the stage. Stage walls slope inward to help focus the sound. With the exception of its wooden floors, the Hall is built of brick, steel, and plaster, with modest decoration. Side balconies are very shallow to avoid trapping or muffling sound, and the coffered ceiling and statue-filled niches along three sides help provide excellent acoustics to essentially every seat. Conductor Herbert von Karajan, in comparing it to the Musikverein, stated that [...] "for much music, it <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>better...</b> because of its slightly lower reverberation time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Forget for a {{few minutes}} that you are reading a copy of your evening paper. Allow your {{imagination}} to carry you to the gentle slope of a moon-lit Spanish hill. Before you rise [...] a vine covered garden wall, broken here and there with graceful arches. Through the archways spreads the soft light of a harvest moon and the dim glow casts shadows over the somber colored walls. [...] Overhead myriads of stars are twinkling in an azure blue sky and soft, fleecy clouds are drifting gently with the breeze. Picture all this in your mind and you have a fair conception of the interior of the Palace theater—Marion's new half million dollar playhouse. The new theater is Spanish in design in all its details. From the walls and the mural decorations to the reproduction of period furniture in the lounges the Spanish design is followed.... the designer of the theater has let his fancy take full flight.

The view from the balcony <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> than the lower floor.

2500|$|Mursal ( [...] meaning [...] "hurried"): if {{the narrator}} between the Successor and Muhammad is omitted from a given isnād, the hadith is mursal, e.g., when a Successor says, “The Prophet said ...” Since Sunnis {{believe in the}} uprightness of all Sahaba, they do not {{view it as a}} {{necessary}} problem if a Successor does not mention what Sahaba he received the hadith from. This means that if a hadith has an acceptable chain all the way to a Successor, and the successor attributes it to an unspecified companion, the isnād is considered acceptable. There are, however, different views in some cases: If the Successor is a young one and it is probable that he omitted an elder Successor who in turn reported from a companion. The opinion held by Imam Malik and all Maliki jurists is that the mursal of a trustworthy person is valid, just like a musnad hadith. This view has been developed to such an extreme that to some of them, the mursal <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> than the musnad, based on the following reasoning: [...] "The one who reports a musnad hadith leaves you with the names of the reporters for further investigation and scrutiny, whereas the one who narrates by way of irsal (the absence of the link between the successor and the Prophet), being a knowledgeable and trustworthy person himself, has already done so and found the hadith to be sound. In fact, he saves you from further research." [...] Others reject the mursal of a younger Successor.|$|E
