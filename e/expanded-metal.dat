50|$|A {{wide variety}} of stucco accessories, such as weep screeds, control and {{expansion}} joints, corner-aids and architectural reveals are sometimes also incorporated into the lath. Wire lath is used to give the plaster something to attach to and to add strength. Types include <b>expanded-metal</b> lath, woven-wire lath, and welded-wire lath.|$|E
5000|$|Pure earthen plaster (plaster without lime, cement, or {{emulsified}} asphalt) {{is applied}} to interior surfaces more frequently than exteriors. Before the plaster can be applied, it must have a surface to bind to. Many types of wire mesh may be used, such as <b>expanded-metal</b> lath, woven wire lath, or welded wire lath. Reed mats are another option. If the plaster is being applied to a smooth surface such as drywall or plywood, a mixture of sand and wheat paste may be painted on to the surface to create the texture needed for plaster to bond.|$|E
5000|$|Ferrocement or ferro-cement (also called thin-shell {{concrete}} or ferro-concrete) is {{a system}} of reinforced mortar or plaster (lime or cement, sand and water) applied over layer of metal mesh, woven <b>expanded-metal</b> or metal-fibers and closely spaced thin steel rods such as rebar. The metal commonly used is iron or some type of steel. It is used to construct relatively thin, hard, strong surfaces and structures in many shapes such as hulls for boats, shell roofs, and water tanks. Ferrocement originated in the 1840s in France and is the origin of reinforced concrete. It has {{a wide range of}} other uses including sculpture and prefabricated building components. The term [...] "ferrocement" [...] has been applied by extension to other composite materials, including some containing no cement and no ferrous material.|$|E
