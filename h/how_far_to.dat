5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an interview about Taking Sides, Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible without making compromises. The question {{is only one of}} limits: <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> go. When one crosses the line, then the compromise starts to be a bad, even deadly, one.” This theme is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, may be related to Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.|$|E

His relationship with his mentor, Aristotle Rodor, is one of many things that keep him from going over the edge and back towards the darkness he had shown in his youth on the streets of Hub City.|$|E
25|$|Modern EMSs read in {{data from}} various sensors about the {{crankshaft}} position, intake manifold temperature, {{intake manifold pressure}} (or intake air volume), throttle position, fuel mixture via the oxygen sensor, detonation via a knock sensor, and exhaust gas temperature sensors. The EMS then uses the collected data to precisely determine how much fuel to deliver and when and <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> advance the ignition timing. With electronic ignition systems, individual cylinders can have their own individual timing so that timing can be as aggressive as possible per cylinder without fuel detonation. As a result, sophisticated electronic ignition systems can be both more fuel efficient, and produce better performance over their counterparts.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, {{during each}} fiscal year, a {{prefecture}} that has nuclear power stations in its territory is legally bound to hold nuclear accident disaster drills, demonstrating how {{to evacuate the}} population out of the 10-kilometer evacuation zone according to the governmental anti-disaster guidelines. The Fukishima Daiichi accidents proved this 10-kilometer zone to be an underestimation of the evacuation zones that would actually be needed to protect {{the population of the}} prefecture from escaping radiation in a proper way. On 5 September 2011, three prefectures—Aomori, Fukushima and Ibaraki—were unable to hold the drills before March 2012. Six prefectures, including Hokkaido and Fukui, had not taken a decision to hold a drill and were awaiting new governmental guidelines on <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> evacuate. Four other prefectures, including Ehime and Saga, planned to hold drills by establishing temporary guidelines and by expanding evacuation zones on their own. The Nuclear Safety Commission aimed to review the evacuation zones and other policies by the end of October.|$|E

500|$|The {{writers have}} made Homer's {{intelligence}} appear to decline over the years; they explain {{this was not}} done intentionally, but {{it was necessary to}} top previous jokes. For example, in [...] "When You Dish Upon a Star", (season 10, 1998) the writers included a scene where Homer admits that he cannot read. The writers debated including this plot twist because it would contradict previous scenes in which Homer does read, but eventually they decided to keep the joke because they found it humorous. The writers often debate <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> go in portraying Homer's stupidity; one suggested rule is that [...] "he can never forget his own name".|$|E
2500|$|Cleopatra uses {{language}} to undermine Antony's assumed authority over her. Cleopatra's [...] "'Roman' language of command works to undermine Antony's authority." [...] By using a Romanesque rhetoric, Cleopatra commands Antony {{and others in}} Antony's own style. In their first exchange in Act I, scene 1, Cleopatra says to Antony, [...] "I'll set a bourn <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> be beloved." [...] In this case Cleopatra speaks in an authoritative and affirming sense to her lover, which to Shakespeare's audience would be uncharacteristic for a female lover.|$|E

In each case the art lies not so much in the finesse of the individual mark, but in the orchestration of a previously uncodified set of personal [...] "rules" [...] about where to act and where not, <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> go and when to stop, {{in such a way as}} the cumulative courtship of seeming chaos defines an original, hybrid kind of order, which in turn illuminates a complex sense of human experience not voiced or left marginal in previous art.|$|E

2500|$|Straight edge (sometimes {{abbreviated}} sXe or {{signified by}} XXX or X) is a subculture of hardcore punk whose adherents refrain from using alcohol, tobacco and other recreational drugs, {{in reaction to}} the excesses of punk subculture. For some, this extends to refraining from engaging in promiscuous sex, following a vegetarian or vegan diet or not using caffeine or prescription drugs. The term straight edge was adopted from the 1981 song [...] "Straight Edge" [...] by the hardcore punk band Minor Threat. Ross Haenfler writes that as of the late 1990s, approximately three out of four straight edge participants were vegetarian or vegan. While the commonly expressed aspects of the straight edge subculture have been abstinence from alcohol, nicotine, and illegal drugs, there have been considerable variations on <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> take the interpretations of [...] "abstaining from intoxicants" [...] or [...] "living drug-free". Disagreements often arise as to the primary reasons for living straight edge. Straight edge politics are primarily left-wing and revolutionary but there have been conservative offshoots.|$|E
2500|$|Maimonides used [...] to {{interpret}} <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> extend {{the principle of}} charity. Maimonides taught that the Law correctly says in [...] "You shall open your hand wide to your brother, to your poor." [...] Maimonides continued that the Law taught how far we have to extend this principle of treating kindly every one with whom we have some relationship — even if the other person offended or wronged us, even if the other person is very bad, we still must have some consideration for the other person. Thus [...] says: [...] "You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother." [...] And if we find a person in trouble, whose assistance we once enjoyed, or of whom we have received some benefit, even if that person has subsequently wronged us, we must {{bear in mind that}} person’s previous good conduct. Thus [...] says: [...] "You shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you were a stranger in his land," [...] although the Egyptians subsequently oppressed the Israelites very much.|$|E
