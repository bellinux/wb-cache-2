5|$|Maxwell also {{investigated}} the <b>kinetic</b> <b>theory</b> of gases. Originating with Daniel Bernoulli, this theory was advanced by the successive labours of John Herapath, John James Waterston, James Joule, and particularly Rudolf Clausius, {{to such an}} extent as to put its general accuracy beyond a doubt; but it received enormous development from Maxwell, who in this field appeared as an experimenter (on the laws of gaseous friction) as well as a mathematician.|$|E
5|$|Between 1859 and 1866, he {{developed}} {{the theory of the}} distributions of velocities in particles of a gas, work later generalised by Ludwig Boltzmann. The formula, called the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, gives the fraction of gas molecules moving at a specified velocity at any given temperature. In the <b>kinetic</b> <b>theory,</b> temperatures and heat involve only molecular movement. This approach generalised the previously established laws of thermodynamics and explained existing observations and experiments in a better way than had been achieved previously. Maxwell's work on thermodynamics led him to devise the thought experiment that {{came to be known as}} Maxwell's demon, where the second law of thermodynamics is violated by an imaginary being capable of sorting particles by energy.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} formal {{extension}} of thermodynamics and <b>kinetic</b> <b>theories</b> {{to a larger}} class of entropy functionals. Kinetic equations associated to Boltzmann, Fermi, Bose and Tsallis entropies are recovered as a special case. This formalism first provides a unifying description of classical and quantum <b>kinetic</b> <b>theories.</b> On the other hand, a generalized thermodynamical framework is justified to describe complex systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion. Finally, a notion of generalized thermodynamics emerges {{in the context of}} the the violent relaxation of collisionless stellar systems and two-dimensional vortices due to the existence of Casimir invariants and incomplete relaxation. A thermodynamical analogy can also be developed to analyze the nonlinear dynamical stability of stationary solutions of the Vlasov and 2 D Euler-Poisson systems. On general grounds, we suggest that generalized entropies arise due to the existence of ``hidden constraints'' that modify the form of entropy that we would naively expect. Generalized kinetic equations are therefore ``effective'' equations that are introduced heuristically to describe complex systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{shape of}} a {{crystalline}} organic solid has {{a major impact on}} its downstream processing and on its end-product quality, issues that are becoming increasingly important in the specialty chemical industry. In particular, shape affects the key washing and filtering steps in solution crystallization, and it determines solids agglomeration and dissolution characteristics. ^ Traditional models for predicting crystal shape are based exclusively on the internal crystal structure. They are able to predict sublimation-grown crystals, but are not able to account for the effects of the environment (i. e., solvent and impurities) that dominate solution-grown shapes. Detailed <b>kinetic</b> <b>theories</b> of crystal growth—the spiral, two-dimensional nucleation, and rough growth mechanisms—have also been developed, but have not been widely employed. They require as input certain face-specific and solvent-specific properties that are generally unknown. ^ This work explores all of the traditional methods and detailed <b>kinetic</b> <b>theories</b> in an attempt to develop a new method for predicting crystal shape. The detailed <b>kinetic</b> <b>theories</b> are simplified, yielding relative face growth rate expressions that depend primarily on kink and edge free energies—two microscopic properties of crystal faces. A method for estimating these properties is also proposed. It depends on the solvent 2 ̆ 7 s surface free energy, which is often known, and the crystal 2 ̆ 7 s internal energy, which can be determined from simple molecular mechanics calculations. ^ The method is used to predict the {{shape of a}}dipic acid grown from water, ibuprofen grown from polar and non-polar solvents, and biphenyl grown from toluene. An extension to this technique is developed in order to estimate hydrogen bonding between solvents and crystals: it is applied to succinic acid grown from water and isopropanol, and to paracetamol grown from water and acetone. This approach appears to be the first practical technique that can successfully predict solution-grown organic crystal shapes. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at {{extending}} the well-known critical state concept, associated with quasi-static conditions, by {{accounting for the}} role played by the strain rate when focusing on the steady, simple shear flow of a dry assembly of identical, inelastic, soft spheres. An additional state variable for the system, the granular temperature, is accounted for. The granular temperature is related to the particle velocity fluctuations and measures the agitation of the system. This state variable, as is in the context of <b>kinetic</b> <b>theories</b> of granular gases, is assumed to govern the response of the material at large strain rates and low concentrations. The stresses of the system are associated with enduring, frictional contacts among particles involved in force chains and nearly instantaneous collisions. When the first mechanism prevails, the material behaves like[*]a solid, and constitutive models of soil mechanics hold, whereas when inelastic collisions dominate, the material flows like a granular gas, and <b>kinetic</b> <b>theories</b> apply. Considering a pressure-imposed flow, at large values of the normal stress and small values of the shear rate, the theory predicts a nonmonotonic shear rate dependence of the stress ratio at the steady state, which is likely to govern the evolution of landslides...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{equilibrium}} {{between two}} phases at phase boundaries clearly indicates that in nature spontaneous changes {{do not necessarily}} proceed towards higher disorder.

From this discrepancy and from other experimental results opposing the increase of disorder the microscopic explanation of entropy is dubious. The expression of entropy has been derived from the equation of state and from the <b>kinetic</b> gas <b>theory.</b> Thus, the physical parameters of EoS and the <b>kinetic</b> gas <b>theory</b> should fully explain the physics of entropy.
