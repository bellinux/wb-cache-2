5|$|In {{order for}} Cole {{to use his}} powers, he must have stored {{electrical}} power, represented by an <b>energy</b> <b>meter</b> on the player's heads-up display (HUD). The player can recharge Cole by draining electricity from powered sources, recharging also restores Cole's health, though Cole's health can regenerate over time without recharging. Many powers are acquired {{over the course of}} the game. The player can use experience points to increase powers' effectiveness or unlock new powers. Experience points are awarded for actions including defeating enemies, healing citizens and completing missions. The player can use such powers to destroy environmental scenery such as towers and stone columns. Depending on the player's choices, the player can gain ice or fire powers from the game's female protagonists, Kuo and Nix. Additionally, passive abilities based on Karma level called Karmic Boosts can be unlocked.|$|E

After battles, characters earn Enhancement Points (EP), {{which can be used}} to strengthen equipped armor, weapons and accessories, instead of using Gald (the in-game currency) as with previous Tales titles. EP can be transferred between weapons. An optional battle arena was added in the PSP version of the game with both single-player and multiplayer matches: in both modes, players need to defeat an enemy team (either AI-controlled enemies or an opposing team) within a time limit.|$|E

25|$|As {{commercial}} use of electric energy {{spread in the}} 1880s, it became increasingly important that an electric <b>energy</b> <b>meter,</b> similar to the then existing gas meters, was required to properly bill customers {{for the cost of}} energy, instead of billing for a fixed number of lamps per month. Many experimental types of meter were developed. Edison at first worked on a direct current (DC) electromechanical meter with a direct reading register, but instead developed an electrochemical metering system, which used an electrolytic cell to totalise current consumption. At periodic intervals the plates were removed and weighed, and the customer billed. The electrochemical meter was labor-intensive to read and not well received by customers.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} radio {{coverage}} of anchor nodes and reliability in an anchor-based {{wireless sensor network}} platform used in locating and monitoring smart <b>energy</b> <b>meters.</b> Knowledge of the location of smart <b>energy</b> <b>meters</b> is critical for network functionalities such as monitoring, billing and energy budget planning. One efficient technique of determining the location of field monitoring and measuring devices such as smart <b>energy</b> <b>meters</b> is the anchor-based localization. Anchor-based localization is a technique in which the unknown node’s location is determined with reference to a location aware node. Anchor-based localization techniques require anchor nodes having good radio coverage to the unknown nodes. The error associated with localization is high when anchor nodes are not optimally accessed by unknown nodes in the network. This paper performed a radio coverage analysis and evaluated the reliability of anchor nodes within a network perimeter for the localization and monitoring of smart <b>energy</b> <b>meters.</b> An outage probability was used to verify reliability of the network for the localization and monitoring of the smart <b>energy</b> <b>meters.</b> Our result show that for a 100 by 100 meter perimeter, four anchor nodes will provide good reliability of radio coverage for the localization and monitoring of smart <b>energy</b> <b>meters...</b>|$|R

Tracks include enclosed tubes, cylinders, tricky jumps, and rollercoaster-esque paths. Some courses are littered with innate obstacles like dirt patches and mines. A heavy {{emphasis is placed on}} track memorization and reflexes, which aids in completing the game. Each machine handles differently, has its own performance abilities affected by its weight, and a grip, boost, and durability trait graded on an A to E (best to worst) scale. Before a race, the player is able to adjust a vehicle's balance between maximum acceleration and maximum top speed. Every machine has an <b>energy</b> <b>meter,</b> which serves two purposes. First, it is a measurement of the machine's health and is decreased, for example, when the machine hits another racer or the side of the track. Second, the player is usually given the ability to boost after the first lap. Boosting greatly increases the racer's speed for a few seconds, but also drains their energy. Pit areas and dash plates are located at various points around the track for vehicles to drive over. The former replenishes energy, while the latter gives a speed boost without using up any energy. The less time spent in the pit area, the less energy will regenerate. Courses may also have jump plates, which launch vehicles into the air enabling them to cut corners.|$|E

40|$|Energy Management Systems (EMSs) {{are used}} to monitor energy {{consumption}} in buildings {{with the purpose of}} improving energy efficiency, by identifying savings opportunities and misuse situations. To achieve that, an EMS collects <b>energy</b> <b>metering</b> data streams from a network of <b>energy</b> <b>meters</b> deployed in a building. Sensor data must be processed in (near) real-time, to support a timely decision making process. Currently, EMSs are using traditional DBMSs to process these data, introducing a persistence step that translates to an unacceptable latency on data evaluation. Moreover, sensor data monitoring queries are not elegantly supported by the SQL query language, thus hampering the ability of an EMS to process <b>energy</b> <b>metering</b> data in real-time. Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) {{are used to}} process data streams efficiently in several domains. Many sensor network monitoring applications have been implemented upon DSMSs resulting in significant improvements on performance and overall resource usage. This thesis validates the hypothesis that, to process <b>energy</b> <b>metering</b> data streams in real-time, EMSs should be supported by DSMSs, instead of DBMSs. We introduce an EMS’s Data Processing Architecture supported by a DSMS that supports the implementation of an EMS capable of performing real-time data processing.

2500|$|F-Zero Climax is {{a racing}} game that plays {{similarly}} to its immediate predecessor (...) {{and the original}} F-Zero game. Players select their vehicles and race around fifty-three courses while avoiding obstacles such as ice and bombs. Each racing craft contains air brakes for drifting around tight corners by pressing the L and R shoulder buttons. A vehicle's health and ability to speed boost after the first lap is measured by an <b>energy</b> <b>meter.</b> Boosting in this manner briefly increases the racer's speed while draining their energy. The player is also rewarded with a stored speed boost for each lap completed. However, this may only be used {{in tandem with the}} energy-draining boost resulting in a double speed boost. Vehicles can drive over pink plates scattered throughout the track to replenish energy. Players can damage competitors with two attacks: a spin attack that quickly rotates the entire vehicle, or a side attack. The former is new to the 2D F-Zero series. Players can also spin attack during a speed boost to inflict extra damage. The game offers four control scheme presets, and personalized button configurations.|$|E

The bass guitar player's multiplier can reach as high as 6x (compared to a 4x multiplier for the other players) and achieve [...] "Bass Groove". Overdrive is collected during select portions of a song by successfully playing all white notes within that section (guitar and bass players can also use the guitar controller's whammy bar to extract Overdrive from white sustained notes). Once the <b>Energy</b> <b>Meter</b> is filled halfway, players can deploy their Overdrive, resulting in the [...] "Band Meter" [...] (which tracks how well each player is doing) changing more dramatically. This allows players to strategically use Overdrive to raise the Band Meter and pass portions of a song they otherwise might have failed. Overdrive can be used to activate score multipliers, which vary based on a player's note streak. In solo play, deploying Overdrive doubles the player's score multiplier. However, in band play, activating Overdrive instead increases the score multiplier of the entire band by two. [...] Additionally, players can deploy Overdrive independently of each other (Guitar Hero games prior to World Tour require players in Co-Operative mode to deploy Star Power simultaneously), as well as collect additional Overdrive while it is deployed and draining.|$|E
