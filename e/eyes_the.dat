5|$|Crickets {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with mostly cylindrical, somewhat vertically flattened bodies. The head is spherical with long slender antennae arising from cone-shaped scapes (first segments) and just behind {{these are two}} large compound eyes. On the forehead are three ocelli (simple <b>eyes).</b> <b>The</b> pronotum (first thoracic segment) is trapezoidal in shape, robust, and well-sclerotinized. It is smooth and has neither dorsal or lateral keels (ridges).|$|E
5|$|A week later, Kratos {{arrives at}} the island of Delos and explores the ruined statue of Apollo. He is {{attacked}} by all three Furies and is eventually captured. Orkos appears and frees Kratos, transporting him to another location. Orkos gives Kratos his Oath Stone and reveals that he and Aletheia tried to warn Zeus of Ares' and the Furies' plan. In retaliation, they took the Oracle's <b>eyes,</b> <b>the</b> objects Kratos seeks. After a perilous journey, Kratos uses the Amulet of Uroborus to restore the statue and retrieve the eyes. On completing the Trials of Archimedes, Kratos is ambushed and captured by the Furies, who confiscate all of his items.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-known}} allele {{found only}} in the Bengal subspecies produces the white tiger, a colour variant first recorded in the early 19th century and found in an estimated one in 10,000 natural births. Genetically, whiteness is recessive: a cub is white only when both parents carry the allele for whiteness. It is not albinism, pigment being evident in the white tiger's stripes and in their blue <b>eyes.</b> <b>The</b> causative mutation changes a single amino acid in the transporter protein SLC45A2.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine is {{detectable}} with {{measuring devices}} in concentrations {{as low as}} 0.2 parts per million (ppm), and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing and vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60ppm. About 1000ppm can be fatal after a few deep breaths of the gas. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) concentration is 10 ppm. Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system and exposure to the gas can irritate the <b>eyes.</b> <b>The</b> toxicity of chlorine comes from its oxidizing power. When chlorine is inhaled at concentrations greater than 30ppm, it reacts with water and cellular fluid, producing hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HClO).|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the attack}} on his family, Captain Pipe {{said that he would}} not seek vengeance. Instead, in September 1778, {{he was one of the}} signers of the Treaty of Fort Pitt between the Delawares and the United States. Americans hoped this {{agreement}} with the Delawares would enable American soldiers to pass through Delaware territory and attack Detroit, but the alliance deteriorated after the death of White <b>Eyes,</b> <b>the</b> Delaware chief who had negotiated the treaty. Eventually, Captain Pipe turned against the Americans and moved his followers west to the Sandusky River, where he received support from the British in Detroit.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{irritation}} can {{be avoided}} by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water. Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds {{than the rest of}} the bulb. Refrigerating the onions before use reduces the enzyme reaction rate and using a fan can blow the gas away from the <b>eyes.</b> <b>The</b> more often one chops onions, the less one experiences eye irritation.|$|E
5|$|Ferb {{was given}} a simplistic {{structure}} so that young audiences {{would be able to}} draw him easily. As with the other characters of Phineas and Ferb, Ferb's design is constructed of geometric shapes in homage to animator Tex Avery. Ferb's head is based on a rectangle with a wider top than bottom. A square is used for his nose, and an egg-shaped oval is used for his <b>eyes.</b> <b>The</b> eye furthest from the screen is always drawn larger than the other. Povenmire uses a nine-step process to draw Ferb, starting with his head and ending with touch ups.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout The Lord of the Rings, [...] "the Eye" [...] (<b>the</b> Red <b>Eye,</b> <b>the</b> Evil <b>Eye,</b> <b>the</b> Lidless <b>Eye,</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Eye)</b> is <b>the</b> image {{most often}} {{associated}} with Sauron. Sauron's Orcs bore the symbol of <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> on their helmets and shields, and referred {{to him as the}} [...] "Eye" [...] because he did not allow his name to be written or spoken, according to Aragorn (a notable exception to this rule was his emissary, the Mouth of Sauron).

5|$|Flies are {{adapted for}} aerial {{movement}} and typically have short and streamlined bodies. The first tagma of the fly, the head, bears the <b>eyes,</b> <b>the</b> antennae, and the mouthparts (the labrum, labium, mandible, and maxilla {{make up the}} mouthparts). The second tagma, the thorax, bears the wings and contains the flight muscles on the second segment, which is greatly enlarged; {{the first and third}} segments have been reduced to collar-like structures, and the third segment bears the halteres, which help to balance the insect during flight. The third tagma is the abdomen consisting of 11 segments, some of which may be fused, and with the 3 hindermost segments modified for reproduction.|$|E
5|$|For example, in {{the common}} {{cuttlefish}} the display consists of flattening the body, making the skin pale, showing a pair of eyespots on the mantle, dark eye rings, and a dark line on the fins, and dilating the pupils of the <b>eyes.</b> <b>The</b> common octopus similarly displays pale skin and dark eye rings with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms and stretches out the web between the arms as far as possible, and squirts out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. The paper nautilus can rapidly change its appearance: it suddenly withdraws the shining iridescent web formed by its first pair of arms from its shell.|$|E
5|$|Italian naturalist Camillo Ranzani {{published}} the first scientific {{description of the}} smalltail shark, in an 1839 volume of Novi Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Instituti Bononiensis.

500|$|Ra is {{not unique}} in this {{relationship}} with <b>the</b> <b>Eye.</b> Other solar gods may interact {{in a similar way}} with the numerous goddesses associated with <b>the</b> <b>Eye.</b> Hathor, a goddess of the sky, the sun, and fertility, is often called <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> of Ra, and she also has a relationship with Horus, who also has solar connections, that is similar to the relationship between Ra and his Eye. Hathor can even be called [...] "the Eye of Horus"—one of several ways in which the distinctions between <b>the</b> two <b>eyes</b> are blurred. <b>The</b> <b>Eye</b> can also act as an extension of and companion to Atum, a creator god closely associated with Ra. Sometimes this <b>eye</b> is called <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> of Atum, although at other times <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> of Ra and <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> of Atum are distinct, with Ra's <b>Eye</b> <b>the</b> sun and Atum's <b>Eye</b> <b>the</b> moon.|$|R
5000|$|Horus was {{the ancient}} Egyptian sky god who was usually {{depicted}} as a falcon, most likely a lanner or peregrine falcon.

5|$|The author noted wryly {{that later}} in the series Allen's hair became similar to a Super Saiyan, a {{transformation}} in the Dragon Ball series where the character's hair becomes spiky. Hoshino said that early in D.Gray-mans publication, Allen {{was one of the}} hardest characters to draw. By the tenth volume, she said that the character was more difficult to draw than Yu Kanda. In the manga's first chapters, Allen's eyes have had different colors (such as red and light blue) due to a discussion between Hoshino and her editor; it was later decided to give him silver <b>eyes.</b> <b>The</b> series' title, D.Gray-man, is meant to have several meanings, (most referring to the state of Allen and the other main characters).|$|E
5|$|The black currawong is {{commonly}} {{confused with the}} clinking currawong, but the latter species has a white rump and larger white wing patches. The black currawong has a heavier bill and a characteristic call unlike the clink-clink call of the clinking. The forest and little ravens are similar in size but lack the white wing patches, and instead have entirely black plumage and white, rather than yellow <b>eyes.</b> <b>The</b> black currawong {{is unlikely to be}} mistaken for the closely related pied currawong as the latter does not reach Tasmania, but it has a longer and deeper bill and lacks the white rump and undertail coverts.|$|E
50|$|Liquid eyeliner, cake eyeliner, or the {{eyebrow pencil}} {{is used to}} accent and frame <b>the</b> <b>eyes.</b> There {{are two ways to}} line the upper lid of the eye: <b>the</b> owl <b>eye</b> or <b>the</b> almond <b>eye.</b> <b>The</b> owl <b>eye</b> is used to widen <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and {{involves}} using a heavier line {{in the middle of the}} lid. <b>The</b> almond-shaped <b>eye</b> is created by extending the line out beyond the outer corner of <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> <b>The</b> lower line is created by using the same tool used on the upper lid.

5|$|The chicks hatch 12–14days after {{incubation}} begins. Like all passerines, {{the chicks}} are altricial; they are hatched naked, with reddish bodies, pale grey down, and closed <b>eyes.</b> <b>The</b> mother bird feeds her young regurgitated seeds and insects as they grow. The hatchlings develop quickly, opening their eyes after three days, and completing {{the growth of}} olive-brown juvenile plumage after 11–15days, at which time they begin to practice short flights close to the nest. For up to three weeks after fledging, they are still fed by the male, who locates them by listening for their fledging call. The chicks stop giving this call when they become entirely independent.|$|E
5|$|The eggs {{have large}} yolks; {{cleavage}} (division) is superficial and a germinal disc develops at the pole. During gastrulation, {{the margins of}} this grow down and surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and <b>eyes.</b> <b>The</b> arms and funnel develop {{as part of the}} foot on the ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a ring around the funnel and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo develops.|$|E
