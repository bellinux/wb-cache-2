40|$|Abstract — This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{assisting}} developers when verifying properties of complex behaviourbased systems. A central aspect of behaviour-based systems is the interaction between the behaviours, as a lot of the functionality of a system typically arises from this interaction. Hence, verification has to deal with the specialities of behaviour interaction. Previous work has introduced a concept for modelling behaviour-based systems as networks of finite-state automata and for applying model checking as verification technique. As the manual verification of large networks is tedious and errorprone, the work at hand introduces a concept for assisting developers by partly automating the verification process. The applicability of the presented approach is demonstrated using the behaviour-based control system of an autonomous <b>bucket</b> <b>excavator.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} the simulation of vehicle kinematics with SimVis 3 D and the Newton Game Dynamics Engine. As running example a Pioneer 1 like robot is used.

Comparing the effort of application code for both approaches shows the benefit of delegating the calculation of rigid body motions. This fact is further stressed by simulating a trailer as a passive vehicle without any code extensions. Finally, a standard vehicle kinematic system consisting of Ackermann steering and rear wheel drive is realized 2.
