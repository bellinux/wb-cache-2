In 1852, the developers built a steam-powered mill next to the river, to cut local trees into railroad ties.

40|$|Abstract – The neoteny of 64 -day-old <b>European</b> <b>plane</b> tree autovegetative progeny is described, {{starting}} {{from the fact that}} sexual maturity in the juvenile stage of tree development is a rare and significant process by which the period of synthesis of new lower taxonomic units is shortened. The observed formation of <b>European</b> <b>plane</b> tree reproductive organs has been classified as induced neoteny. Compared to the inflorescences of mature <b>European</b> <b>plane</b> trees, the number of precocious inflorescences was lower, flower structure was simpler, and the diameters of inflorescences were the same. As neoteny is a genetic and physiological marker for the tree genotype and the species, and as it is classified as an example of parallel-inherited variability explained by changed interactions of trophic, hormonal and genetic systems, this analysis of neoteny can be a contribution to its further scientific study and its practical utilization at a larger scale...|$|E

Unlike a western plane, the support bed for the blade is not a flat surface in a Japanese plane - rather it is convex. The blade itself is tapered both in thickness and in width so as to wedge tightly into the dai when tapped down into place. Japanese planes are operated by pulling rather than pushing, and much work is done in the seated position or alongside a planing beam.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The <b>European</b> Galactic <b>Plane</b> Surveys (EGAPS) {{will for}} the first time ever map the {{complete}} galactic plane (10 x 360 degrees) down to 21 st magnitude in u', g', r', i' and H-alpha and partly in He I 5875. It will complete a database of ~ 1 billion objects. The aim of EGAPS is to study populations of short-lived stellar and binary phases in our Galaxy and combine these population studies with stellar and binary evolutionary codes to vastly improve our understanding of crucial phases of stellar evolution. Target populations include Wolf-Rayet stars, planetary nebulae, white dwarfs (in binaries), cataclysmic variables and other mass-transferring binaries. Methods: EGAPS is using the INT+WFC on La Palma for the Northern Hemisphere and will use the VST+Omegacam in the Southern Hemisphere. Results: The Northern red survey (IPHAS, using r', i', and Halpha) has started in 2003 and is currently 70 % complete. The northern blue survey (UVEX; u',g',r' and HeI) has started in June 2006. Results include the detection of a number of rare planetary nebulae, cataclysmic variables, red-dwarf white dwarf binaries in clusters, a possible AM CVn candidate, and a deep photometric and spectroscopic investigation of the Cyg X region. Discussion: EGAPS will revolutionize the field of galactic stellar astrophysics by completing the first ever digital, multicolour survey of the Galactic Plane...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the protection of intellectual property (IP) and human rights has been examined in {{a growing number of}} publications. Most focus on the substantive law overlaps, interfaces, tensions and maybe even conflicts between the two areas of law – be it on the national, regional (e. g. <b>European)</b> or international <b>plane.</b> This contribution does not purport to advance this debate on substantive intersections – such as access to medicines under the right to health versus patent protection for pharmaceutical products. Instead, it focuses on the legal mechanisms and approaches to address some of these intersections between the two systems. In that way, it builds on the discourses concerning fragmentation, regime interaction and global legal pluralism that offer different narratives on how specific areas of international law view, define and delineate their relations to another. Within this context, the contribution focuses on the direct and indirect conflict avoidance and resolution approaches adopted by the two main European Courts which have been increasingly asked to rule on cases where intellectual property (IP) protection and human rights are intersecting. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) are both charged with examining the consistency of national laws and measures with human rights protection for IP. Both courts are equally confronted with cases where national IP protection and enforcement measures are argued to interfere and conflict with other human rights, such as freedom of expression and information, the right to privacy or to conduct one’s own business. In reviewing the decisions of the two courts in these areas, this contribution highlights the range of tools and approaches available for human right law to deal with its various interfaces with IP protection...|$|R
