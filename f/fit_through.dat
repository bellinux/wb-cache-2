25|$|The cotton gin is a {{mechanical}} device that removes the seeds from cotton, {{a process that}} had previously been extremely labor-intensive. The word gin is short for engine. The cotton gin was a wooden drum stuck with hooks that pulled the cotton fibers through a mesh. The cotton seeds would not <b>fit</b> <b>through</b> the mesh and fell outside. Whitney occasionally told a story wherein he was pondering an improved method of seeding the cotton when he was inspired by observing a cat attempting to pull a chicken through a fence, and could only pull through some of the feathers.|$|E

25|$|In this {{application}} the intention {{is that the}} bailout cylinder should hold sufficient breathing gas for the diver {{to be able to}} reach a place of safety where more breathing gas is available, such as the surface or a diving bell. To achieve this the cylinder must contain enough gas to allow decompression if that is included in the planned dive profile and there is no bell. Cylinder volumes are generally at least 7 litres, and may in some cases be as much as twin 12-litre sets. Bailout sets used by closed bell divers must <b>fit</b> <b>through</b> the bottom airlock door.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we use some well known theorems of {{algebraic}} geometry in reducing polynomial Hermite interpolation and approximation in any {{dimension to the}} solution of linear systems. We present a mix of symbolic and numerical algorithms for low degree curve <b>fits</b> <b>through</b> points in the plane, surface <b>fits</b> <b>through</b> points and curves in space, and in general, hypersuface <b>fits</b> <b>through</b> points, curves, surfaces, and sub-varieties in n dimensional space. These interpolatory and (or) approximatory fits may also be made to match derivative information along all the sub varieties. Such multi-dimensional hypersurface interpolation and approximation provides mathematical models for scattered data sampled in three or higher dimensions {{and can be used}} to compute volumes, gradients, or more uniform samples for easy and realistic visualization. 1.

25|$|The {{two main}} current {{competitors}} of the Panama Canal are the US intermodal {{system and the}} Suez Canal. The main ports and merchandise distribution centers in these routes are investing in capacity, location, and maritime and land infrastructure to serve post-Panamax container ships and their larger cargo volumes. According to the ACP, the growing usage of such ships in transcontinental routes competing with the canal is irreversible. It was estimated that by 2011 approximately 37% of {{the capacity of the}} world's container ship fleet would consist of vessels that did not <b>fit</b> <b>through</b> the current canal, and a great part of this fleet could be used on routes that compete with Panama.|$|E

25|$|In 1950 a {{diesel-electric}} locomotive {{was built for}} use in the melting shop of Templeborough steelworks. The duty had special requirements for a locomotive to <b>fit</b> <b>through</b> a small opening and around tight curves while being powerful enough to haul heavy ‘Casting Cars’. The weight of the locomotive had to be high to give better grip. The design featured a Paxman engine and British Thompson-Houston electric equipment powering and 0-4-0 chassis. The first locomotive (Works number 2480) left the works at the end of 1950 with a second (No. 2481) leaving in early 1951. No.2480 was displayed and demonstrated before final delivery while No.2481 was delivered direct from the works (a journey of about 1 mile). Both locomotives survived to be preserved in the late 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The Saint Lawrence Seaway and Great Lakes Waterway {{make the}} Great Lakes {{accessible}} to ocean-going vessels. However, shifts in shipping to wider ocean-going container ships—which do not <b>fit</b> <b>through</b> the locks on these routes—have limited container shipping on the lakes. Most Great Lakes trade is of bulk material, and bulk freighters of Seawaymax-size or less can move {{throughout the entire}} lakes {{and out to the}} Atlantic. Larger ships are confined to working in the lakes themselves. Only barges can access the Illinois Waterway system providing access to the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River. Despite their vast size, large sections of the Great Lakes freeze over in winter, interrupting most shipping from January to March. Some icebreakers ply the lakes, keeping the shipping lanes open through other periods of ice on the lakes.|$|E
25|$|These {{mutations}} have {{a common}} end result; they destabilise the cytoskeletal scaffold of cells. This stability is especially important in erythrocytes as they are constantly {{under the influence of}} deforming shear forces. As disc-shaped erythrocytes pass through capillaries, which can be 2-3 micrometres wide, they are forced to assume an elliptical shape in order to <b>fit</b> <b>through.</b> Normally, this deformation lasts only as long as a cell is present in a capillary, but in hereditary elliptocytosis the instability of the cytoskeleton means that erythrocytes deformed by passing through a capillary are forever rendered elliptical. These elliptical cells are taken up by the spleen and removed from circulation when they are younger than they would normally be, meaning that the erythrocytes of people with hereditary elliptocytosis have a shorter than average life-span (a normal person's erythrocytes average 120 days or more).|$|E

25|$|In 1908, {{detailed}} {{plans were}} created by the PSC. The plan was changed to not have the line run via IRT trackage. In having it run via its own trackage, the line could be operated by railroads other than the IRT as standard 10 foot-wide railroad cars could <b>fit</b> <b>through</b> the tunnels. To connect to Manhattan without using IRT trackage the line would use part of contracts given for other lines. The line would use the Manhattan Bridge–Revised route, which was approved in 1909 and was originally conceived to connect the IRT Brooklyn Line at Flatbush Avenue, east of the Nevins Street station, to the Canal Street Subway and the proposed Third Avenue Subway going both north and south under the Bowery. The tracks would have used both {{the north and south}} tracks on the Manhattan Bridge.|$|E
25|$|In March 1551, her {{condition}} improved somewhat {{and she was}} able to receive a messenger from Bona Sforza who informed her that Bona recognized her marriage to Sigismund Augustus. It was described as her last victory. Her health continued to decline and she had fever, diarrhea, nausea. Sigismund Augustus personally tended to his sick wife even though reportedly she stank of pus. He wanted to take her to Niepołomice where he hoped that spring weather would lessen her suffering. When there was a doubt whether a special wagon to transport Barbara could <b>fit</b> <b>through</b> the city gates, Sigismund Augustus ordered the gate demolished. Barbara died on 8 May 1551 in Kraków. She asked to be buried in Vilnius and her body was transported to Vilnius Cathedral, where she was buried on 23 June next to Sigismund Augustus' first wife Elizabeth of Austria. Her death was a severe loss to the King; it is said that for {{a good portion of the}} journey he followed her coffin on foot. It was said that Sigismund Augustus became more serious, avoided parties, and liked to dress black for the rest of his life.|$|E
25|$|Denmark {{also began}} {{a number of}} reforms aimed at urbanizing the Greenlanders, principally to replace their {{dependence}} on (then) dwindling seal populations and provide workers for the (then) swelling cod fisheries, but also to provide improved social services such as health care, education, and transportation. These well-meaning reforms {{have led to a}} number of problems, particularly modern unemployment and the infamous Blok P housing project. The attempt to introduce European-style urban housing suffered from such inattention to local detail that Inuit could not <b>fit</b> <b>through</b> the doors in their winter clothing and fire escapes were constantly blocked by fishing gear too bulky to fit into the cramped apartments. Television broadcasts began in 1982. The collapse of the cod fisheries and mines in the late 1980s and early 1990s greatly damaged the economy, which now principally depends on Danish aid and cold-water shrimp exports. Large sectors of the economy remain controlled by state-owned corporations, with Air Greenland and the Arctic Umiaq ferry heavily subsidized to provide access to remote settlements. The major airport remains the former US air base at Kangerlussuaq well north of Nuuk, with the capital unable to accept international flights on its own, owing to concerns about expense and noise pollution.|$|E
