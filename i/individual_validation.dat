Overall, 63 percent of the 495 respondents stuck to the truth in the survey settings. The mail survey elicited significantly more truthful responses (67 percent) than the face-to-face survey (58 percent). Female, older, and better-educated respondents confessed their delinquent behavior less often than male, younger, and less-educated ones. Whereas the need for social approval did not show {{a significant effect on}} the probability of an honest answer when controlling for other variables, trait desirability did. Regarding the face-to-face survey, the more interviews an interviewer had success-fully completed in the ongoing study, the higher the response quality of the interviewees. In the mail mode, a strong negative effect of time to response could be observed: the longer respondents waited before they sent back the questionnaire, the lower the validity of their answers.

40|$|International audienceScanning laser {{vibrometer}} measurements generate detailed maps of modal {{characteristics in}} normal or 3 D directions. Since many points are measured, <b>individual</b> <b>validation</b> of cannot be performed manually {{in a reasonable}} time frame and a notable fraction of measurements {{is expected to be}} fairly noisy. The key new notion of the paper is a quantiﬁcation of identiﬁcation error and level of contribution for each mode and each sensor based on the comparison of measured and synthesized transfers around each resonance. These criteria are shown to allow efﬁcient analysis of the validity of large measurement sets to provide an automated procedure to select sensors that should be kept for each mode. This quantiﬁcation, being performed before correlation, provides a priori estimates of sources of poor correlation associated with the identiﬁcation process. It thus becomes possible to provide improved Modal Assurance Criterion estimations where, for each modeshape, sensors known to be incorrectly identiﬁed can be discarded.

40|$|Stratum-specific {{weighted}} {{analysis is}} available in SAS procedures such as PROC SURVEYMEANS & SURVEYLOGISTIC, which include the DOMAIN statement. However, other procedures that can model correlated outcomes, including PROC GENMOD, do not. This presentation demonstrates a method of assigning individual weights to each record in a dataset to perform weighted subset analysis on a correlated outcome without creating domain variables or transferring analysis to a separate program. This demonstration employs data from the National Immunization Survey Teen (NIS-Teen). The NIS-TEEN includes provider & household weights and details the immunization status for several vaccines for each respondent. To compare weighted estimates of vaccination rates, where respondents receive several vaccines and had adequate provider data, a domain variable must be created or analysis moved into a different program. To calculate individual weights, {{the sum of the}} provider weights of the respondents with a positive provider weight is calculated. Then, each respondent’s positive provider weight is divided by the sum of the positive provider weights & multiplied by the total sample size of respondents with a positive provider weight. The newly recalculated individual level provider weights can be used in the in SAS PROC SURVEYFREQ, allowing for weighted variable by variable comparisons. It permits the use of PROC GENMOD, with multivariate data, to perform weighted domain-specific analyses that account for correlations among the multiple vaccines offered to <b>individuals.</b> <b>Validation</b> of the proper calculation of weighted results is proven by producing identical estimates as analysis in STATA...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{encroachment}} on dense, coastal koala populations has {{ensured that}} their management has received increasing government and public attention. The recently developed National Koala Conservation Strategy calls for maintenance of viable {{populations in the}} wild. Yet the success of this, and other, conservation initiatives is hampered by lack of reliable and generally accepted national and regional population estimates. In this paper we address this problem in a potentially large, but poorly studied, regional population in the State {{that is likely to}} have the largest wild populations. We draw on findings from previous reports in this series and apply the faecal standing-crop method (FSCM) to derive a regional estimate of more than 59 000 <b>individuals.</b> <b>Validation</b> trials in riverine communities showed that estimates of animal density obtained from the FSCM and direct observation were in close agreement. Bootstrapping and Monte Carlo simulations were used to obtain variance estimates for our population estimates in different vegetation associations across the region. The most favoured habitat was riverine vegetation, which covered only 0. 9 % of the region but supported 45 % of the koalas. We also estimated that between 1969 and 1995 - 30 % of the native vegetation associations that are considered as potential koala habitat were cleared, leading to a decline of perhaps 10 % in koala numbers. Management of this large regional population has significant implications for the national conservation of the species: the continued viability of this population is critically dependent on the retention and management of riverine and residual vegetation communities, and future vegetation-management guidelines should be cognisant of the potential impacts of clearing even small areas of critical habitat. We also highlight eight management implications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background DNA microarrays {{are popular}} tools for {{measuring}} gene expression of biological samples. This ever increasing popularity is ensuring {{that a large}} number of microarray studies are conducted, many of which with data publicly available for mining by other investigators. Under most circumstances, validation of differential expression of genes is performed on a gene to gene basis. Thus, it is not possible to generalize validation results to the remaining majority of non-validated genes or to evaluate the overall quality of these studies. Results We present an approach for the global validation of DNA microarray experiments that will allow researchers to evaluate the general quality of their experiment and to extrapolate validation results of a subset of genes to the remaining non-validated genes. We illustrate why the popular strategy of selecting only the most differentially expressed genes for validation generally fails as a global validation strategy and propose random-stratified sampling as a better gene selection method. We also illustrate shortcomings of often-used validation indices such as overlap of significant effects and the correlation coefficient and recommend the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) as an alternative. Conclusion We provide recommendations that will enhance validity checks of microarray experiments while minimizing the need to run a large number of labour-intensive <b>individual</b> <b>validation</b> assays. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: RNAi screens via pooled short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) have {{recently}} become {{a powerful tool}} for the identification of essential genes in mammalian cells. In the past years, several pooled large-scale shRNA screens have identified a variety of genes involved in cancer cell proliferation. All of those studies employed microarray analysis, utilizing either the shRNA’s half hairpin sequence or an additional shRNA-associated 60 nt barcode sequence as a molecular tag. Here we describe a novel method to decode pooled RNAi screens, namely barcode tiling array analysis, and demonstrate how this approach can be used to precisely quantify the abundance of individual shRNAs from a pool. Results: We synthesized DNA microarrays with six overlapping 25 nt long tiling probes complementary to each unique 60 nt molecular barcode sequence associated with every shRNA expression construct. By analyzing dilution series of expression constructs we show how our approach allows quantification of shRNA abundance from a pool and how it clearly outperforms the commonly used analysis via the shRNA’s half hairpin sequences. We further demonstrate how barcode tiling arrays can be used to predict anti-proliferative effects of individual shRNAs from pooled negative selection screens.

Patients with positive CD serology but normal mucosa (Marsh 0) are at increased risk of future CD. In this study we describe a model for identifying and characterizing individuals with normal mucosa but positive CD serology. Such individuals are sometimes referred to as having latent CD. Methods The records of ten Swedish pathology departments were used to identify individuals with biopsies indicating normal duodenal/jejunal mucosa. Using the national personal identification number, these data were linked with CD serology data (antigliadin, antiendomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibodies); and we thereby identified 3, 736 individuals with normal mucosa but positive CD serology. Two independent reviewers then manually reviewed their biopsy reports to estimate comorbidity. We also randomly selected 112 <b>individuals</b> for <b>validation</b> through patient chart review. Results The majority of the 3, 736 individuals were females (62 %). Children (0 – 15 years) made up 21. 4 %. The median number of biopsy specimen was 3. Our review of biopsy reports found that other gastrointestinal comorbidity was rare (inflammatory bowel disease: 0. 4 %; helicobacter pylori infection: 0. 2 %). Some 22 % individuals selected for patient chart review had a relative with CD. The most common symptoms among these individuals were diarrhea (46 %) and abdominal pain (45 %), while 26 % had anemia. Although 27 % of the <b>individuals</b> selected for <b>validation</b> had been informed about gluten-free diet, only 13 % were adhering to a gluten-free diet at the end of follow-up.

Methods Two hundred and twenty eight slides of archival pathology tissues from 13 different types of malignant tumors were compared with healthy tissues from the same individuals. DNA analysis was performed using standard techniques for forensic STR analysis, PowerPlex® 16 and Identifiler® on 2 distinct sample sets. Genetic instability was assessed by comparing reference tissues with cancerous tissues derived from the same individual. Loss of heterozygosity, a ≥ 50 % reduction in heterozygosity ratio between healthy and diseased samples, and microsatellite instability, {{the presence of an}} additional allele not present in reference tissue, were assessed. The quality of profiles obtained with respect to completeness among the archived samples and degradation using the 2 platforms were also compared. Results Profiles obtained using the Identifiler® system were generally more complete, but showed 3 -fold higher levels of instability (86 %) than those obtained using PowerPlex ® 16 (27 %).

Our proposed adaptive threshold setting method outperforms the conventional threshold setting approaches greatly and also exhibits a mildly improvement in comparison with the earlier method for this problem in terms of tracking performance, especially in track loss percentage (TLP). However the computational burden of our method is reduced significantly because in our method generally only one IRF corresponding to the common validation region, not the every IRF corresponding to the <b>individual</b> model-conditioned <b>validation</b> region, is needed for threshold optimization at each time step and an approximate closed-form solution can also be obtained for the special case of the Neyman-Pearson (NP) detector. 1...|$|R

An individual user performs a data analysis and compiles a list of findings in a desktop environment. When enough interesting results are found, the user meets with other analysts in a collaborative environment to discuss and share these findings. After sharing findings with each other, the users then work together interactively to perform a collaborative group analysis. Afterwards, the users then take {{the findings from the}} collaborative analysis back into a single-user setting for <b>individual</b> analysis and <b>validation.</b> This process then continuously repeats.|$|R
