5|$|Quantification of the {{proportion}} of barbarian-born troops in the 4th-century army is highly speculative. Elton has undertaken the most {{detailed analysis of the}} meagre evidence.

5|$|The {{genesis of}} Alvin can be {{attributed}} to a tropical wave that crossed Dakar, Africa on May9. The wave remained poorly organized as it moved across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea through mid-May. On May20, the disturbance crossed Central America and emerged into the eastern Pacific Ocean, where convection—shower and thunderstorm activity—gradually began to <b>increase</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> well-defined center; this {{led to the formation of}} a tropical depression by 0000UTC on May27, approximately 345mi (555km) south of the southern tip of Baja California. Following designation, the depression was slow to organize as a result of moderate easterly shear; by 0000UTC on May29, however, the system had gained enough organization to be considered a tropical storm. After attaining its peak intensity with winds of 40mph (65km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1003mb (hPa; 29.62inHg), increasingly stable air and higher wind shear caused Alvin to begin a weakening trend. At 0600UTC on May30, it weakened to a tropical depression, and by 0000UTC on June1, Alvin degenerated into a non-convective remnant low. The remnant low continued generally westward until dissipation six days later.|$|E
