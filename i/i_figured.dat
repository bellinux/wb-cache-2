5|$|I'd {{done a lot}} {{of videos}} and wasn't always a hundred percent thrilled. For the most part, I was never thrilled with the results, so <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> I would give {{directing}} a shot. It was a pretty simple concept. Most of the scenes were featured at the amusement park, at a late-night outdoor celebration. I was really happy to be able to include O.D.B in the remix video.|$|E
5|$|Writing poetry was a {{means of}} passing the time for {{soldiers}} of many nations, and the horses of World War <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> prominently in several poems. In 1982, Michael Morpurgo wrote the novel War Horse, about a cavalry horse in the war. The book was later adapted into a successful play of the same name, and also into a screenplay, with the movie, released on December 25, 2011 in the United States. In January 2010, the History Channel aired a documentary entitled The Real War Horse, depicting the horses of World War I.|$|E
5|$|I {{started doing}} {{different}} charity events where I did {{a combination of}} 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero'. We made it into a medley {{and put them in}} the same key and made it work. People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even talking to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> that it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E

500|$|The {{audience}} reacted immediately; Charles {{could feel}} the room shaking and bouncing as the crowd was dancing. Many audience members approached Charles {{at the end of}} the show to ask where they could purchase the record. Charles and the orchestra performed it again several nights in a row with the same reaction at each show. He called Jerry Wexler to say he had something new to record, later writing, [...] "I don't believe in giving myself advance notices, but <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> this song merited it".|$|E
500|$|Slayer {{embarked}} on the Reign in Pain tour with the bands Overkill in the United States and Malice in Europe; they {{also served as}} the opening act for W.A.S.P.'s U.S. tour in 1987. In late November 1986, drummer Lombardo quit the band; he said: [...] "I wasn't making any money. I think I had just gotten married, and <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> if we were gonna be doing this professionally—on a major label—I wanted my rent and utilities paid." [...] To continue the tour Slayer enlisted Whiplash drummer Tony Scaglione.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{viewing the}} {{proposed}} expanded {{version of the}} film, I felt that the cut was simply too long and the pacing completely thrown off. After all, I cut those scenes out for a reason back in 1979. However, {{in the interest of}} giving the fans a new experience with Alien, <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> there had to be an appropriate middle ground. I chose to go in and recut that proposed long version into a more streamlined and polished alternate version of the film. For marketing purposes, this version is being called [...] "The Director's Cut." ...|$|E
500|$|For the {{recording}} session, Dylan invited Mike Bloomfield from the Paul Butterfield Blues Band to play lead guitar. Invited to Dylan's Woodstock {{home for the}} weekend to learn new material, Bloomfield recalled, [...] "The first thing I heard was 'Like a Rolling Stone'. <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> he wanted blues, string bending, because that's what I do. He said, 'Hey, man, I don't want any of that B.B. King stuff'. So, OK, I really fell apart. What the heck does he want? We messed around with the song. I played {{the way that he}} dug, and he said it was groovy." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} sessions {{served as}} the first production credit for Scott-Heron, Jackson, and Jose Williams. As the third unofficial collaboration between Scott-Heron and Jackson, the album's recording featured more of Jackson's input than before. Jackson recounted the experience in an interview for All About Jazz, stating [...] "He had this way with words and I thought to myself, 'People have to hear this stuff'. What I had to offer was the music and <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> if we can take his words and make this tribal knowledge rhythmic and musical, we can draw people to hear it." ...|$|E

In an interview with LA Weekly, Piane commented that he wants his remix remembered, instead of Bale's outburst: [...] "We're all people in this world. So <b>I</b> <b>figured,</b> [...] remembering that one time Christian Bale went crazy on set, maybe people will remember the remix." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{he began}} {{recording}} Confessions in 2003, Usher claimed {{he did not}} want to work with any new producers. Production began between Usher and Jermaine Dupri, who produced his last two albums, My Way (1997) and 8701 (2001). In spite of his vision, Usher stated, [...] "With this album I chose some new producers who <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> would definitely allow me to really articulate myself in a different way... Every album you gotta grow. You gotta look for something different." [...] Dupri also invited his frequent collaborator Bryan-Michael Cox.

The band got its recording deal {{as a favor}} for the artwork bassist Mike D'Antonio created for Ferret. The label's CEO, Carl Severson signed the band without a contract simply to get the album {{out to the public}} because he thought the album [...] "ruled", and stated [...] "I had a one-off deal and when I knew they wanted to go someplace bigger, <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> it was in my best interest, as their friend, to make the best thing happen for them."

500|$|Laich {{received}} {{national media}} attention {{when he stopped}} to help two stranded Capitals fans change their flat tire after a Game 7 loss in the 2010 playoffs. When he came across {{the woman and her}} teenaged daughter stranded on the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge, Laich stopped to install their spare and apologized for the club's early loss in the playoffs. [...] For his efforts, Laich was hockey analyst Michael Farber's nominee for the 2010 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year. When asked about the incident, Laich responded, [...] "It's not a big deal. It was just a tire.

500|$|They also {{recognized}} the importance of a name: agreeing it should be one suitable for the organization envisioned. To Reynard fell the task of finding such a name. [...] In explaining how she came up with the nautical name, Reynard said: [...] "I realized that there were two letters which had to be in it: W for women and V for volunteer, because the Navy wants {{to make it clear that}} this is a voluntary service and not a drafted service. So I played with those two letters and the idea of the sea and finally came up with Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service – WAVES.
