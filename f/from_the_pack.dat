5|$|The {{beginning}} {{to the race}} highlighted {{the dominance of the}} Kenyan and Ethiopian runners as they set a high tempo from the outset. By the time the first 5km marker was passed, Australia's Nikki Chapple was the only athlete left in the leading pack to come from outside the two historically strong nations. A few kilometres later, she dropped back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> and at the 10km mark five Ethiopians and four Kenyans had a fifteen-second advantage {{on the rest of the}} field. As the race reached the midway point, the temperature began to increase and the heat and humidity reduced the pace of the runners. The conditions took their toll on some of the leaders in this section of the race. Chepchirchir slowed considerably while Meseret Mengistu, Joyce Chepkirui and Fate Tola were the next to gradually lose contact with the front runners. Kiplagat, Dire, Arusei and Feyse Tadese were the sole contenders remaining as the race headed towards the final stages, but Kiplagat and Dire soon left the other two trailing a few minutes later.|$|E
5|$|The peloton {{remained}} intact for roughly {{the first half}} of the sixth stage. Luigi Ganna and Carlo Galetti broke away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> and made it to the finish in Rome where Ganna then edged out Galetti for the stage victory. During the next stage, a group of six riders lead for the most part before Galetti and Ganna broke away again. The two riders made their way to the finish in Genoa, where a large crowd of spectators came to see the finish. Ganna went on to win his second consecutive stage, while Galetti extended his lead over the rest of the field. The race's eighth stage contained some harsh climbs, most notably the Giovi. The finish of the stage was hotly contested as Galetti, Ganna, and Eberardo Pavesi finished at the same time, with Galetti winning the stage in the end.|$|E
5|$|To promote Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, special retailer-exclusive costume packs were {{available}} as pre-order bonuses. If {{the game was}} pre-ordered from GameStop, the players received the Femme Fatale Pack (Chun-Li, Morrigan, Storm, X-23). Amazon offered the New Age of Heroes Costume Pack (Akuma, Doctor Doom, Sentinel, Strider Hiryu), while Best Buy gave access to the Villains Costume Pack (C. Viper, M.O.D.O.K., Super-Skrull, Wesker). After the game's launch, several other costume packs became available for purchase on specific dates through the Xbox Live Marketplace and PlayStation Network. The Ancient Warriors Costume Pack, consisting of Arthur, Firebrand, Hulk, and Magneto, was originally planned {{to be released in}} December 20, 2011. However, on December 19, 2011, Capcom announced that the pack would be delayed until March 6, 2012, due to existing controversy with Magneto's alternate costume. The costume in question, which was based on Magneto's appearance in Marvel's House of M series, bore similarities to the attire of the King of Spain, Juan Carlos I, and was later removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack.</b>|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} part of the 20th century, under the {{leadership}} of Harry Payne Whitney, polo changed to become a high-speed sport in the United States, differing from the game in England, where it involved short passes to move the ball towards the opposition's goal. Whitney and his teammates used the fast break, sending long passes downfield to riders who had broken away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> at a full gallop.|$|E
25|$|A {{photograph}} was taken of Richmond captain-coach Dyer, aged 30 and playing his {{two hundred and}} twenty second game, wearing white strapping on his left thumb, and a dirty knee bandage on his left knee, breaking away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack,</b> with {{his eyes fixed on}} the Lake end goals (Dyer went on to kick a goal), {{in the last quarter of}} the 1944 Preliminary Final, held at the Junction Oval, on Saturday 23 September 1944, in which Richmond defeated Essendon, primarily due to Dyer's nine goals.|$|E

25|$|The gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), {{a distant}} {{relative}} of the European red fox, is also hunted in North America. It is an adept climber of trees, making it harder to hunt with hounds. The scent of the gray fox is {{not as strong as}} that of the red, therefore more time is needed for the hounds to take the scent. Unlike the red fox which, during the chase, will run far ahead <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack,</b> the gray fox will speed toward heavy brush, thus making it more difficult to pursue. Also unlike the red fox, which occurs more prominently in the northern United States, the more southern gray fox is rarely hunted on horseback, due to its densely covered habitat preferences.|$|E

25|$|In the men's race, the Brownlee brothers, Alistair and Johnathan, and Gómez {{exited the}} swim first and quickly formed, with eight others, an eleven-man {{breakaway}} group. At {{the end of}} the first bike lap, the breakaway had accumulated a 20-second lead. Olympic Champion Jan Frodeno bridged the gap and the now 12-man breakaway pushed on to the run section with a two-minute lead. On the run, the Brownlees separated themselves <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack,</b> along with Gómez. However, Gómez fell off the pace and the finish became a one-on-one duel between the brothers. In the final kilometre, Alistair kicked away from Jonathan before stopping in the finishing straight and walking across the line with his brother, with Johnathan making sure that Alistair crossed first. It was the first time that both brothers had appeared on the podium and it was Alistair's third straight win in Madrid. Gómez's third place kept him at the top of the overall standings, five points ahead of Jonathan. Polyansky, who finished fifth in Madrid, rounded out the top three in the overall standings. With his win, Alistair jumped up 20 places in the standings to fifth place in the overall standings.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Adam Markovitz panned {{the record}} as an empty gesture and {{asserted}} that the album was rushed, signifying an album with [...] "barely enough zip to keep the kids up past dinner." [...] Likewise, Robert Copsey from Digital Spy wrote, [...] "The result [...] may see them progressing at a snail's pace, but when you've got it so good, what's the rush anyway?" [...] In a mixed review, The New York Times contributor Jon Caramanica appreciated the album's sonic palette, but dismissed its lyricism as narrow and tedious, and Sheeran's contributions as [...] "unusually lumpy {{in the hands of}} such a polished group". Caramanica characterised the members' vocals as [...] "fundamentally interchangeable", and opined that only Zayn Malik [...] "breaks free <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> vocally with any regularity." ...|$|E
500|$|Booster Draft [...] {{is usually}} played with eight players. The players are seated {{around a table}} and each player is given three booster packs. Each player opens a pack, selects a card from it, and passes the {{remaining}} cards to the next player. Each player then selects one of the remaining cards <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> he or she just received, and passes the remaining cards again. This continues until all of the cards are depleted. Players pass left {{for the first and}} third packs, and right for the second. Players then build decks out of any of the cards that they selected during the drafting. Talking, signaling, and showing cards is forbidden during the drafting process, except for double faced cards from the Innistrad and Shadows over Innistrad blocks and [...] "Magic Origins", which cannot be hidden as each side of the physical card has a spell printed on it.|$|E
500|$|The {{delays in}} {{breaking}} free <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> had ended Stenhouse's hopes of bringing rapid relief to Cape Evans. His priority now was to reach New Zealand {{and return to}} the Antarctic the following spring. During the final frustrating weeks in the pack, Hooke had been working on the wireless apparatus and had started transmitting again. He {{and the rest of the}} crew were unaware that the wireless station at Macquarie Island, the closest to their drift, had recently been closed by the Australian government as an economy measure. On 23 March, using a specially-rigged [...] quadruple aerial, Hookes transmitted a message which, in freak atmospheric conditions, reached Bluff Station, New Zealand. The next day his signals were received in Hobart, Tasmania, and during the following days he reported the details of Aurora's position, its general situation, and the plight of the stranded party. These messages, and the freak conditions which made transmission possible over a much greater distance than the equipment's normal range, were reported throughout the world.|$|E

Melody Lau of the National Post wrote, [...] "It's easy to get lost in inherent appeal of their perfectly coiffed dos and almost-too-put-together preppy style but somewhere {{in the midst of all}} the love-struck squeals of teenage girls are guys who can actually sing and, to a certain extent, entertain." [...] Jane Stevenson of the portal site Canoe concurred: [...] "What I didn't really prepare myself for was that they all can actually sing in concert." [...] Chris Richards, writing in The Washington Post, dissented from the approval: [...] "As the five traded couplets, it was tough to imagine a future Justin Timberlake, Ricky Martin or Bobby Brown emerging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack.</b> No one voice stood out." [...] Mike Wass of Idolator felt One Direction's [...] "surprisingly accomplished effort" [...] of Kings of Leon's [...] "Use Somebody" [...] proved that One Direction are [...] "more than capable" [...] of evolving their sound.|$|E
500|$|American Pharoah had {{the lead}} {{within the first}} quarter-mile and was {{challenged}} by Mr. Z early on, but held the lead on the inside throughout the race. He was challenged by Dortmund and then Divining Rod, but American Pharoah broke <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> in the homestretch and won by seven lengths, as Tale of Verve made a strong rally to overtake Divining Rod to place. Firing Line slipped badly at the start and was eased in the stretch. The winning time was 1:58.45. Espinoza did not use his whip {{at all in the}} Preakness, and stated, [...] "I couldn't see how far I was in front because there was so much water in my eyes." [...] The margin of victory was tied for the sixth-largest in Preakness history. The win by American Pharoah set up an attempt for the Triple Crown for the second straight year. It was also the second straight year that Espinoza had won both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and the jockey's third time winning both races.

500|$|In 2005 David Crane {{published}} a new Scott biography {{in which he}} comes to the conclusion that Scott is possibly the only figure in polar history except Lawrence Oates [...] "so wholly obscured by legend". According to Barczewski, he goes some way towards an assessment of Scott [...] "free from the baggage of earlier interpretations". What has happened to Scott's reputation, Crane argues, derives from the way the world has changed since the [...] "hopeless heroism and obscene waste" [...] of the First World War. At the time of Scott's death, people clutched at the proof he gave that the qualities that once made Britain great were not extinct, but with the knowledge what lay only two years ahead, the ideals of duty, self-sacrifice, discipline, patriotism and hierarchy associated with his tragedy take on a different and more sinister colouring. Crane's main achievement, according to Barczewski, is the restoration of Scott's humanity, [...] "far more effectively than either Fiennes's stridency or Solomon's scientific data." [...] Daily Telegraph columnist Jasper Rees, likening the changes in explorers' reputations to climatic variations, suggests that [...] "in the current Antarctic weather report, Scott is enjoying his first spell in the sun for twenty-five years". The New York Times Book Review was more critical, pointing out Crane's support for Scott's account regarding the circumstances of the freeing of the Discovery <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> ice, and concluded that [...] "For all the many attractions of his book, David Crane offers no answers that convincingly exonerate Scott from a significant share of responsibility for his own demise." ...|$|E
