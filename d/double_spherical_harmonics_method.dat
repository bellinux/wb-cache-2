Despite this simplicity and popularity, KM theory {{has never had}} its theoretical basis formally established. In this work, we derive KM theory systematically from the radiative transfer equation (RTE) by application of the spectrally convergent <b>double</b> <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonics</b> <b>method,</b> of order one, {{and analysis of the}} resulting, transformed, system of equations in the positive- and negative-going fluxes. We call these the generalized Kubelka-Munk (gKM) equations, and they are able to account for general boundary sources and nonhomogeneous terms. Having established theoretical footing for KM theory, we extend gKM's four-flux method to higher dimensions, applying it to a Gaussian boundary source and demonstrating the method's range of validity. Finally, we examine the application of the gKM method to the vector radiative transport equation (vRTE), allowing for the modeling of sources with polarized light. These methods offer a low cost approximation to the solutions of the scalar and vector RTE's, which we validate through comparison with benchmark solutions of the transport equation...|$|E

40|$|Summary. We have {{determined}} the lateral distribution of Love-wave phase velocities in the Pacific for the periods 40, 67, 91 and 125 s. Application of the pure-path and <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonic</b> representation <b>methods</b> {{indicates that the}} velocities are primarily {{a function of the}} age of the seafloor. A compari-son of the results from these two techniques indicates inherent modelling constraints in both methods. The pure-path method is limited by its a priori nature while the <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonic</b> approach is unsuitable in describing sharp lateral velocity gradients. To circumvent these limitations, we propose the sequential application of the pure-path and <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonic</b> <b>methods.</b> The sequential inversion separates the velocity distribution into two separate com-ponents; velocity {{as a function of the}} age of the oceanic plate and variations superimposed on this relationship. Application of this method demonstrates the presence of velocity anomalies which cannot be modelled by an age-velocity relationshp. These anomalies are tentatively correlated with regions of anomalous seafloor depths and/or the presence of active hot-spots. In the central south Pacific, an area with numerous active hot-spots coincides roughly with a region of anomalously slow Love wave velocities. A method for determining the errors associated with the slowness distributions calcu-lated by the <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonic</b> <b>method</b> is presented and provides a means for determining the resolvability of these features...|$|R
30|$|This {{result can}} be {{obtained}} for approximation by spectral functions as in the <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonics</b> <b>method</b> (in which case t≥ 0 is arbitrary), for instance, {{as well as for}} approximation by piecewise constants as in the discrete ordinates method (in which case 0 ≤t≤ 1).

30|$|As low order series {{expansions}} in <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonics</b> do {{not permit}} a very localized resolution of the angular variable, the method performs best when the solutions are nearly isotropic in angle, which {{is the case in}} diffusive, so-called “optically thick” media. Then, rather low order <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonics</b> approximations might suffice for a good approximation. Indeed, the P 1 method can be formulated as a diffusion equation for the incident radiation (Modest 2003, Sec. 15.4). For smooth solutions, the <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonics</b> <b>method</b> exhibits spectral convergence in angle (Grella and Schwab 2011 a).|$|R
40|$|The exact {{treatment}} of the radiative transfer equation (RTE) is difficult even for idealized situ-ations and simple boundary conditions. A number of higher-order approximations, such as the moment method, discrete ordinates <b>method</b> and <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonics</b> <b>method,</b> provide efficient solution methods. A statistical method, such as the photon Monte Carlo method, solves the RTE by simulating radiative processes such as emission, absorption, and scattering. Although ac-curate, it requires large computational resources and the solution suffers from statistical noise. The third-order <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonics</b> <b>method</b> (P 3 approximation) used here decomposes the RTE into a set of 16 first-order partial differential equations. Successive elimination of <b>spherical</b> <b>harmonic</b> tensors reduces this set to six coupled second-order partial differential equations with general boundary conditions, allowing for variable properties and arbitrary three-dimensional geometries. The tedious algebra required to assemble the final form is offset by greater accu-racy {{because it is a}} spectral method as opposed to the finite difference/finite volume approach of the discrete ordinates method. The radiative solution is coupled with a direct numerical so-lution (DNS) of turbulent reacting flows to isolate and quantify turbulence–radiation interac-tions.

40|$|The {{mathematical}} modelling of the polarized radiation transfer (RT) at the satellite remote sensing (SRS) of the strongly anisotropic cloudy atmosphere needs an efficient well-conditioned algorithm with accelerated solution convergence to be developed. The accelerated convergence {{can be achieved}} by the small angle approximation (SAA) subtracting from the general solution of the vectorial (polarization) RT equation (VRTE). The reminder, being a smooth function, is computed rapidly. In the current paper the SAA is determined in the frame of reference (FoR) containing the arbitrary directed sunlight rays. In contrast to the FoR containing the vertical direction of the slab the system for the coefficients of the radiation field with the coupled mutual azimuthally Fourierexpansion amplitudes is obtained.

In steady state, the radiative transfer equation is an integro-differential equation of five independent variables.
