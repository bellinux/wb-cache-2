Continuation operators like [...] capture the entire remaining computation {{at a given}} point in the program and provide no way of <b>delimiting</b> this capture. <b>Delimited</b> continuation operators address this by providing two separate control mechanisms: a prompt that <b>delimits</b> a continuation operation and a reification operator such as [...] or [...] Continuations captured using <b>delimited</b> operators thus only represent {{a slice of the}} program context.|$|R

5|$|Python is {{intended}} to be a highly readable language. It is designed to have an uncluttered visual layout, often using English keywords where other languages use punctuation.

Further, Python has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.|$|E

40|$|<b>Delimited</b> continuations are {{the mother}} of all monads! So goes the slogan {{inspired}} by Filinski's 1994 paper, which showed that <b>delimited</b> continuations can implement any monadic effect, letting the programmer use an effect as easily as if it was built into the language. It's a shame that not many languages have <b>delimited</b> continuations. Luckily, exceptions and state are also {{the mother of}} all monads! In this Pearl, we show how to implement <b>delimited</b> continuations in terms of exceptions and state, a construction we call thermometer continuations. While traditional implementations of <b>delimited</b> continuations require some way of "capturing" an intermediate state of the computation, the insight of thermometer continuations is to reach this intermediate state by replaying the entire computation from the start, guiding it using a "replay stack" it so that the same thing happens until the captured point. Along the way, we explain <b>delimited</b> continuations and monadic reflection, show how the Filinski construction lets thermometer continuations express any monadic effect, share an elegant special-case for nondeterminism, and discuss why our construction is not prevented by theoretical results that exceptions and state cannot macro-express continuations...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to give a logical {{understanding}} of control operators for <b>delimited</b> (partial) continuations, in particular, Danvy and Filinski's shift/reset. Starting with a simple type system for a static analogue of the shift/reset operators, we analyze the type structure in a logical way, which gives rise to control operators for <b>delimited</b> continuations. The resulting control operators nicely behave in the sense that it satises strong normalization and other nice properties, and we can use them with a higher order types. We nally compare our control operators with the original shift/reset operators.
