500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by former Formula One driver Mark Webber, both Mercedes drivers expressed delight at their result. Hamilton in particular described his race as [...] "great" [...] {{and added that}} he [...] "loved the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to come through from far behind." [...] Sebastian Vettel meanwhile was satisfied with his start, but lamented the red flag situation and said that Ferrari had not expected Mercedes to opt for the harder tyre compound and go {{until the end of}} the race. He later added that he was confident that Ferrari had closed the gap to Mercedes and would be able to compete for the championship throughout the season. Nico Rosberg later revealed that the team had been close to retiring his car due to persisting brake issues caused by debris caught in the brake caliper. However, he was able to manage the brake temperatures to secure victory. Rosberg also apologised to his teammate for making contact and forcing him wide at the start.|$|E

"We knew {{we could}} have played better in that Test [...] The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> got {{so close to the}} Blacks proved we were close to them in ability, and {{when it came to the}} third Test in Wellington, we had a sense of giving {{everything}} to salvage our reputation. New Zealand had not won a Test match against Australia in Wellington since 1982. Not so long ago, you might think, but let me tell you, that is a lifetime by New Zealand's standards. And what happened that day really angered me. We played as though our lives depended on it; we tackled them as though they were demons; we knocked them back and we kept at them, mercilessly hounding them when they had possession and flattening them in some shuddering tackles. Not surprisingly, it won us the Test, but immediately apparent was the question: why the hell hadn't we played like that in the first two Tests?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, Frank Fenter {{was chosen}} by Atlantic Records partner Nesuhi Ertegun to head the label in the United Kingdom. Within six months, Frank Fenter was the Managing Director in charge of Atlantic Records' {{operations}} in all of Europe. Fenter was responsible for making Atlantic Records [...] "the most important American label in promoting British music", according to the late Ahmet Ertegun, co-founder and Chairman of Atlantic Records and The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, {{who went on to}} say, [...] "We wound up with quite a lot of British bands, {{due in large part to}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> put Frank Fenter in charge of all Atlantic Records activity in Europe" [...] In Frank Fenter's capacity and role as Managing Director of Atlantic Records European Operations, he played a vital role in having brought Led Zeppelin to Atlantic Records and helped discover and sign such British progressive-rock groups as Yes and King Crimson.|$|E

2500|$|Basically, they [...] {{wanted us}} to re-sign and do a new {{contract}} before our old one was done and we didn't want to do that. We wanted to fulfil our original contract {{and then go on}} from there because {{there were a number of}} labels that were interested in working with us. [...] We were playing hardball back and forth with the label and that's why that record ... it was a difficult period for us. We were all pretty pissed off and angry and that shows in the music. Our budget got slashed for that record just because of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not re-signed. I think it came down to [...] "Well, re-sign now or this is your budget because that's what is says in your contract." [...] You can't argue with that. We didn't re-sign. We didn't buckle under and I think it paid off in the end because we got what we wanted [...] We got everything that we wanted in our new record deal ... everything that we've worked ten fucking years for and deserve, we got. We learned how to play the game and we played it very well.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you {{can tell}} me about the great fight. We heard of it, at Dongola, but beyond the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> thrashed the Khalifa, and taken Omdurman, we {{received}} no particulars.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> our tickets fixed up {{will go to}} show what our {{intentions}} were, Si. However, we have put our feet into it, and must take what comes." ...|$|E

5000|$|Fiorina {{said at the}} 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference that President Obama's {{proposal}} for free community college was intended [...] "to distract us from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> too many failing high schools".|$|R
30|$|From Step 1 {{we found}} a large number by our search criteria. <b>We</b> believe <b>that</b> this can be {{attributed}} to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> used broad search terms. Furthermore, we do not excluded duplicate papers in this step.|$|R
5000|$|Spinoza {{argues that}} the second kind of {{knowledge}} arises: from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> common notions and adequate ideas of the properties of things." [...] He goes on to explain what this means in the propositions which immediately follow.|$|R
60|$|As {{a matter}} of course, the old man's opinion settled the question, and we hauled around for a run down the bay, double reefing the {{mainsail}} and jib, as was proper when you {{take into consideration the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the same as no cargo aboard to give the pungy stiffness.|$|E
60|$|I {{had been}} quite sure {{that they would not}} venture beyond the room in which I had {{discovered}} them, though I had not guessed at what deterred them. The simple <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> found no reptiles in the corridor through which we had just come was sufficient assurance that they did not venture there.|$|E
6000|$|Last spring I met General Miles again, and {{he commented}} on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> known each other thirty years. He said it was strange that we had not met years before, when we had both been in Washington. At that point I changed the subject, and I changed it with art. But the facts are these: ...|$|E
6000|$|... “There is {{an opinion}} <b>that</b> the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not {{adhered to the}} {{declaration}} of Paris does not exempt us from the duty of respecting the principles therein enunciated.

30|$|Previous studies [18] {{suggest that}} better {{quantification}} of 177 Lu activity is achieved when {{data from the}} PW 208 is used for image reconstruction.

60|$|In fact, if {{he should}} tell no more than he already knew, without {{attempting}} {{to add to the}} story in any way, that officer who listened to him could, and with good reason, have set it down as a <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> remained in the village to act the part of spies, after which straightway every building in the village would be searched.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{tell me how}} {{it happens}} that {{you are on the}} Patuxent river taking prisoners here and there without due warrant from the {{government}} at Washington," [...] the commodore said with a smile, and I began by explaining why we started in search of the fleet, not forgetting to make mention of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> hoped to find a sale for fish or oysters.|$|E
60|$|The {{trial was}} {{conducted}} in private by the Keeper of the Seals--a lean, wizened individual, with an air as musty and dry {{as that of the}} parchments among which he had spent his days.

5000|$|Ihde (2006) {{argues that}} movies like the Matrix trilogy play upon fantasy in a {{technological}} context and {{relate to the}} human sense of embodiment.

60|$|Then he went out, {{my father}} leaning {{heavily on his}} arm, and Jerry and I faced {{each other in the}} gloom, heeding not the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> had nothing to eat during nearly eight and forty hours, save the chips of ham and the unsavory mess {{prepared}} by Jim; thinking only of what we were to do, and the many chances against success.|$|E
60|$|I {{have often}} {{wondered}} since, {{if we had}} had at our hand as many stones as could have been used, {{what would have been}} the result?

6000|$|We had put {{the pilot}} off at midday, but the Britannia towed us well into the {{afternoon}} and did not cast us off until the ocean was wide about us and the land a faint blur on the western horizon.

30|$|The {{strength}} {{of the study is}} that it explored psychosocial problems in a sample of patients with RA, derived directly from everyday clinical practice, and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> used several well validated questionnaires to verify them.
