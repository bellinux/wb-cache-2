50|$|The {{method is}} to check that data falls the {{appropriate}} parameters defined by the systems analyst. A judgement as to whether data is valid is {{made possible by the}} validation program, but it cannot ensure complete accuracy. This can only be achieved through the use of all the clerical and computer controls built into the system at the design stage. The difference between data validity and accuracy can be illustrated with a trivial example. A company has established a Personnel file and each record contains a field for the <b>Job</b> <b>Grade.</b> The permitted values are A, B, C, or D. An entry in a record may be valid and accepted by the system if it is one of these characters, {{but it may not be}} the correct grade for the individual worker concerned. Whether a grade is correct can only be established by clerical checks or by reference to other files. During systems design, therefore, data definitions are established which place limits on what constitutes valid data. Using these data definitions, a range of software validation checks can be carried out.|$|E
40|$|D. Cur. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} a <b>job</b> <b>grading</b> system for nurses in a specific private health service. Nursing personnel form a significant component of the manpower in private health services and must therefor be utilized in the most costeffective manner. The Labour Relations Act (South Africa, 1996) demands that the principles of fair labour practice must be applied in all dimensions of personnel management. In the dynamic relationship between the employer and employee within private health services, the nurse as employee has the right to fair labour practice. The <b>job</b> <b>grading</b> system is described by means of a qualitative, exploratory and descriptive research design within the context of a specific private health service in South-Africa. The system is described according to the Paterson <b>job</b> <b>grading</b> system (1957), the NIPN-Q system of the Institute for Personnel Management, the Peromnes system, the Hay-method and the JE Manager method of <b>job</b> <b>grading.</b> The methodological assumptions of the study are based on Botes' research model (1994) which implies a functional approach to the practice of Nursing Science. The context of the study is a particular private health service where all categories of nurses are employed. The aim of the system is the facilitation of fair labour practice as included in the legislation concerning labour relations. Within the context of this study, the implementation of the <b>job</b> <b>grading</b> system is the duty of the nursing human resources manager and to function as agent for the implementation of the <b>job</b> <b>grading</b> system implies specific internal sources such as abilities, attitudes and values in order to facilitate fair labour practice. The study takes place in four phases. During phase one of the study the expectations of the role-players with regard to a <b>job</b> <b>grading</b> system for nurses in a particular private health service were explored and described by means of focus group interviews as well as individual interviews with top management and supported by literature. Applying the strategies as suggested by Lincoln and Guba (1985 : 290) ensured trustworthiness. From this data a total of twenty-one statements were formulated. A theoretical framework for the <b>job</b> <b>grading</b> system was described during phase two of the study based on the identified concepts and relevant national and international literature. During the description of the theoretical framework, deductive logic was utilized to formulate statements for each concept. At the end of the theoretical framework, six sets of statements were formulated with a total of fifty statements. The contents of the <b>job</b> <b>grading</b> system were derived from the generated statements of the expectations and the statements from the conceptual framework by means of deductive and inductive logic. During phase three of the study, which comprised the development of the <b>job</b> <b>grading</b> system, the system was validated and refined by a representative profile of the different role-players. The system was also made available in English and guidelines for implementation was described. The emphasis in the guidelines is based on the principles of democracy and the facilitation of fair labour practice. During phase four of the study the system was validated and evaluated for its' operationalization value by means of individual application of the system by nurses holding certain posts in the specific private health care service. Content validity was determined by means of a content validity index as described by Lynn (1986). The unique contribution of this study is the description of a <b>job</b> <b>grading</b> system for nurses with fair labour practice as purpose. The strength of the study is grounded in the verification, validation and operationalization of the system, which is significant of the implement value of the system in the practice...|$|R
5000|$|Broadbanding is a <b>job</b> <b>grading</b> {{structure}} that falls between using spot salaries vs. many <b>job</b> <b>grades</b> {{to determine what}} to pay particular positions and incumbents within those positions. While broadbanding gives the organization using it some broad job classifications, {{it does not have}} as many distinct <b>job</b> <b>grades</b> as traditional salary structures do. [...] Thus, broadbanding reduces the emphasis on ‘status’ or hierarchy and places more of an emphasis on lateral job movement within the company. In a broadbanding structure an employee can be more easily rewarded for lateral movement or skills development, whereas in traditional multiple grade salary structures pay progression happens primarily via job promotion. In this way, broadbanding is a more flexible pay system. This flexibility, however, can lead to internal pay relativity problems as there isn’t as much control over salary progression as there would be within a traditional multi-level grading structure.|$|R

Most research on job status, however, has focused on salaried populations, and it remains unclear whether job status operates similarly among hourly workers. Our objectives were to examine whether hourly status itself influences risk of hypertension after adjustment for socioeconomic confounders, and to explore the role of fine-scale <b>job</b> <b>grade</b> on hypertension incidence within hourly and salaried groups. We examined data for 14, 999 aluminum manufacturing employees in 11 plants across the U. S., using logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity and other individual characteristics. Propensity score restriction was used to identify comparable groups of hourly and salaried employees, reducing confounding by sociodemographic characteristics. <b>Job</b> <b>grade</b> (coded 1 through 30, within hourly and salaried groups) was examined as a more refined measure of job status. Hourly status was associated with an increased risk of hypertension, after propensity restriction and adjustment for confounders. The observed effect of hourly status was stronger among women, although the propensity-restricted cohort was disproportionately male (96 %). Among salaried workers, higher <b>job</b> <b>grade</b> was not consistently associated with decreased risk; among hourly employees, however, there was a significant trend, with higher job grades more protective against hypertension.

Thus, the potentiating effect of high effort active coping as measured by the John Henryism Active Coping Scale, on socioeconomic status, as measured by <b>job</b> <b>grade,</b> was considered in relation to blood pressure in a Nigerian civil servant population. DESIGN: The influence of John Henryism on the association between educational level or socioeconomic status and increased blood pressure was examined during a comprehensive blood pressure survey. John Henryism refers to a strong behavioural predisposition to actively cope with psychosocial environmental stressors. SETTING: Benin City, Nigeria.

40|$|Research {{of social}} {{networks}} {{has revealed that}} certain components of network position {{can have an impact}} on organizational effectiveness, yet relatively little research has been conducted on network position and individual performance. This study sought to determine if a relationship exists between an employee's social network position and an individual's job performance. The participant organization was a network of individuals within an Information Technology (IT) department at a major defense company. A social network analysis (SNA) was conducted to determine the employee's network position, measured by centrality and constraint. Centrality refers {{to the extent to which}} an individual is connected to others. Constraint refers to how constrained or inhibited an individual is within the network. Performance was measured by annual appraisal ratings provided by the employee's supervisor. Hierarchical regression analysis was performed to determine relationships between the dependent variable (performance) and independent variables of centrality and constraint. Secondary variables also studied in relation to the model included education level, service years (tenure), <b>job</b> <b>grade,</b> and age. The overall model revealed 17 % of variance explained. The primary predictors of network position, centrality and constraint, were not statistically significant predictors of performance ratings.

40|$|The data {{presented}} was a {{comparative study of}} the labour organization, utilization and valuation {{of male and female}} bank employees as it relates to job status and <b>job</b> <b>grade.</b> Variables such as education level, amount of time employed by the bank, age, marital status, and number of children were controlled in this examination. It was found that education level, time employed by the bank, and age were not significant variables in explaining the <b>job</b> <b>grade</b> differences between full-time and part-time employees, and male and female employees. The only exception occurred for employees 25 years of age or less, and part-time employees. For these two groups, differences in the <b>job</b> <b>grade</b> levels between male and female employees disappeared. The introduction of marital status and number of children revealed a complex inter-relationship between job status and gender. Single employees and employees with children were the most likely to be employed part-time. However, for these groups, men and women were equally as likely to be employed part-time. This equal gender distribution changed for the 2 ̆ 7 non-single 2 ̆ 7 employees and employees with children, not because women were more likely to work part-time, but because men were much more less likely to work part-time. The examination of job status shifting revealed that male and female single employees and employees with no children were equally as likely to shift job status. These groups were more likely than the 2 ̆ 7 non-single 2 ̆ 7 worker 2 ̆ 7 s and workers with children to shift job status. These findings lend support to the idea of self-selection in job status arrangement. Yet, the factors influencing this self-selection are in need of examination given the results of the unequal valuation of labour according to gender and full-time job status.

Previous research has identified older age, impaired cognitive function, lower educational level, living alone, fewer social activities, and lower socio-economic status as predictors of attrition. Methods This project examined attrition in participants of the Whitehall II study aged between 51 – 71 years, using data from questionnaires participants have completed biennially since 1985 when the study began. We examine the possibility of two distinct forms of attrition – non-response and formally requesting to withdraw – and whether they have different predictors. Potential predictors were age, gender, marital status, occupational grade, retirement, home ownership, presence of longstanding illness, SF- 36 quality of life scores, social participation and educational level comparing participants and those who had withdrawn from the study. Results The two forms of attrition share many predictors and are associated but remain distinct. Being older, male, having a lower <b>job</b> <b>grade,</b> not being a home owner, not having a long standing illness, having higher levels of education, and not having retired, were all associated with a greater probability of non-response; being married was associated with higher probability in women and lower in men.
