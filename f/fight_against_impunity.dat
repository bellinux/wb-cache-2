40|$|Officially {{the war in}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has ended, {{but human}} rights reports leave no doubt that the {{conflict}} is still going on, particularly in the Eastern provinces. The widespread and systematic use of rape as a weapon of war has put the issue of sexual violence {{at the heart of the}} public debate. Rape victims are faced with severe physical and psychological trauma, high risks of unwanted pregnancies, infections with sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS, and rejection by their family and the community. Based on broader empirical research focusing on the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) rights and needs of war-affected children, this article suggests the adoption of a rights-based approach in the aid to rape victims. Such an approach should not only pay attention to the provision of direct aid to the victims and to protecting them from being repeatedly victimised, but also to the prevention of the further spread of sexual violence. Direct aid to the victims requires the development of comprehensive programmes that should include five interrelated and complementary components: medical assistance, psychosocial support, economic aid, legal aid, and protection. Prevention should focus on the <b>fight</b> <b>against</b> <b>impunity</b> and the elimination of socio-cultural barriers that enhance the ‘acceptability’ of sexual violence perpetrated by non-combatants. In the reconstruction of the country the <b>fight</b> <b>against</b> <b>impunity</b> will be paramount to counteract the ‘ethical vacuum’ that has been created, whereby other forms of sexual violence, such as adult men making use of the services of children who try to survive as sex workers, are not only tolerated but even accepted. Given the complete state of impoverishment in the DRC to which the author calls attention, the support of international donors will be indispensable. The creation of effective coordinating mechanisms will be essential and the strengthening of the national and local capacities to respond properly to the needs of the rape victims will be paramount in order to guarantee sustainability of the programmes...|$|E
