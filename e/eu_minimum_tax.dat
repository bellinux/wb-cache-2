Most of the literature does not focus directly on the political decision making process and assumes that the desired tax policy is responding to objective underlying tradeoffs. Based on an original survey of members of German national parliament (Bundestag) in 2006 / 7 we document a strong ideological bias among policy makers {{with respect to the}} perceived mobility of international tax bases (real capital and paper profits). Ideology influences also directly and indirectly the perceived national autonomy in tax setting and preferences for a <b>EU</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> for companies. There seems little consensus as to what the efficiency costs of capital taxation in open economies are, even though our survey falls in a period of extensive debate about and actual adoption of a company tax reform bill in Germany. ...|$|E

Based on an original survey of members of German national parliament (Bundestag) in 2006 / 7 we document a strong ideological bias among policy makers {{with respect to the}} perceived mobility of international tax bases (real capital and paper profits).

From a comparative politics perspective our results document the strong role of party discipline in a parliamentary democracy as the actual voting behaviour within a party is much more cohesive than the survey evidence suggests.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} the Swedish Programme for improving energy efficiency in energy-intensive industries (PFE). Since 2005, some 100 energy-intensive companies have entered this five year voluntary agreement (VA) and been exempted from the <b>EU</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> on electricity. In return, each company is required to: conduct an energy audit and analysis; identify {{and invest in}} profitable electricity saving measures; implement and certify an energy management system; introduce routines for energy efficient procurement and project planning. For most participants the first programme period was completed in 2009 and available data enables this PFE ex-post evaluation. An impact evaluation compiles and analyse data that the companies have reported to the administrating agency, the Swedish Energy Agency (SEA). This assessment of quantifiable results is complemented by a process-oriented approach that combines studies of policy documents, previous evaluations and personal communication with administrators as well as companies. The bottom-up calculation method distinguishes between gross and net impact. While the SEA estimates a gross impact of 1450 GWh/year the net impact consists of an interval between 689 and 1015 GWh of net annual electricity savings. PFE has effectively and to a low cost exceeded the estimated impact of a minimum tax and can thus be judged as successful. A comprehensive evaluation plan could facilitate relevant data gathering in PFE and similar VAs and could, in doing so, improve accuracy and possibly reduce evaluation cost. Such a plan should give weight also to the organisational changes, with potential long-lasting effects, that these programmes are capable of promoting...|$|E
40|$|This paper tests new {{implications}} of the asymmetric tax competition model on diesel excise taxes in the European Union (EU). I extend the standard tax competition model by replacing the unit demand assumption with iso-elastic demand. As a result, not only {{the level of the}} equilibrium tax but also the slope of the tax reaction function depends positively {{on the size of the}} country. The new implication is testable on panel data in first differences, and it is tested on a panel of 16 European countries. The results provide strong evidence for strategic interaction in the setting of diesel excises and confirm the effect of country size on the response to tax changes in neighboring countries. Strategic interaction between EU countries intensified in the mid 1990 s and drove small European countries to set lower diesel tax rates. These results explain why the <b>EU's</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> policy has failed to harmonize diesel tax rates across member states. <b>tax</b> competition, <b>minimum</b> <b>tax,</b> asymmetric regions, diesel excise, European Union...|$|R
40|$|A {{large part}} of the {{literature}} on tax competition argues that capital tends to be undertaxed if there is no international coordination of tax policies. This result constitutes an important theoretical basis for practical tax policy in particular in the <b>EU,</b> where <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> rates have been proposed for corporate taxation and withholding taxes on interest income. This paper shows that coordination arrangements of the type currently discussed in the EU face the problem that national governments have incentives to neutralise coordinated <b>tax</b> increases or <b>minimum</b> rates by adjusting tax instruments not covered by the agreement. Capital tax coordination will therefore only be effective if it takes into account the interaction between all available tax instruments that affect the cost of capital. ...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{is one of}} the {{alternative}} transport fuels expected to replace conventional oil based fuels. The paper finds that it is possible for non-fossil-based hydrogen to become the lowest cost fuel without favourable tax treatment. The order of per kilometre cost depends on performance in hydrogen production, the international oil price, and fuel taxes. At low oil prices, the highest per kilometre costs were found for non-fossil power-based hydrogen, the second highest for natural gas-based hydrogen, and the lowest for conventional fuels. At high oil prices, this ranking is reversed and non-fossil power-based hydrogen becomes the most cost competitive fuel. General fuel taxes lower the threshold at which the international oil price reverses this competitiveness order. The highest fuel tax rates applied in Europe lowers this threshold oil price considerably, whereas the lowest fuel taxes may be insufficient to make hydrogen competitive without tax favours. Alternative adjustments of the <b>EU</b> <b>minimum</b> fuel <b>tax</b> rates with a view to energy efficiency and CO 2 -emissions are discusse...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{proposals for}} the reform of the U. S. system of taxing cross-border income including dividend exemption, full current inclusion, a Japanese type version of dividend exemption with an effective tax rate test subject to an exception for an active business, dividend exemption combined with a <b>minimum</b> <b>tax,</b> and repeal of check-the-box. We consider two versions of dividend exemption with a minimum tax: {{one in which the}} <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> is imposed on a country by country basis and another in which the <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> is based on overall foreign income. In addition we evaluate versions of <b>minimum</b> <b>taxes</b> that allow current deductions for tangible investment against the <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> base. To compare these schemes with current law, we reevaluate the efficiency cost of the dividend repatriation tax using evidence from the response to the 2005 repatriation tax holiday. We find that the burden of avoiding repatriations is higher than found in previous estimates, particularly for high tech profitable foreign businesses, and rises as deferrals accumulate. We simulate the effect of the various alternatives on effective tax rates for investment in high and low tax countries with inclusion of the importance of parent developed intangibles and their role in shifting income from the United States. Our analysis demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} make improvements to the system across many dimensions including the lockout effect, income shifting, the choice of location and complexity. The goals are not necessarily in conflict. Compared to the other schemes, we find the per country <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> with expensing for real investment has many advantages with respect to these margins. The per country <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> offsets (at least in part) the increased incentives for income shifting under pure dividend exemption and is better than full inclusion in tailoring companies' effective tax rates to their competitive position abroad. No U. S. tax burden will fall on companies that earn just a normal return abroad. The <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> is basically a tax on large excess returns in low tax locations, cases in which the company probably has less intense foreign competition. The investment will still be made. Unlike the Japanese type dividend exemption alternative considered, there is no cliff in which the income is subject to the full home country rate if it fails the <b>minimum</b> effective <b>tax</b> rate and active business test. Under the <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> with no cliff the company has more of an incentive to lower foreign taxes and will often prefer paying the U. S. <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> to paying a higher foreign <b>tax.</b> Finally, the <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> with expensing is more effective in discouraging income shifting than repeal of check-the-box. In summary, the per country <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> with expensing combines the advantages of the extreme alternatives, dividend exemption and full inclusion, and reduces their shortcomings. Our comparison of the overall and per country <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> suggests that the overall version deserves serious consideration. While it is not as thorough as the per country <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> in targeting tax haven income, it is a substantial move in that direction and is much simpler...|$|R

40|$|The 21 st Century {{has seen}} {{unprecedented}} levels of corporate tax aggressiveness and avoidance. This article continues our exploration of second best international tax reforms {{that would protect}} the U. S. corporate tax base and have some likelihood of adoption. In this case, we consider how a U. S. <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> on foreign income earned by a controlled foreign corporation should be {{designed to protect the}} United States against erosion of its corporate income tax base and to combat tax competition by low-tax intermediary countries. In the authorsโ view, a <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> should be an interim levy that preserves the residual U. S. tax on foreign income, as distinguished from a final <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> that partially eliminates the U. S. residual <b>tax.</b> An interim <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> would be a significant improvement over current law and would more effectively limit incentives to seek low-taxed foreign income while ameliorating pressure to retain excess earnings abroad. To achieve the objectives of such a <b>minimum</b> <b>tax,</b> corresponding changes should be made to the U. S. corporate resident definition, the source taxation of foreign MNCs, and the residence taxation of U. S. portfolio investors in foreign corporations to reduce tax advantages under current law for investments in foreign corporations. These changes would reduce tax advantages for foreign parent corporate groups and thereby further protect the U. S. tax base as well as reduce incentives for U. S. corporations to expatriate as a consequence of increased U. S. taxation of foreign income under an interim <b>minimum</b> <b>tax...</b>|$|R
