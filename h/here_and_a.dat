25|$|In 1987 the Gaziantep Museum {{excavated}} two tomb chambers {{that had}} been broken into by antiquity smugglers in the necropolis southwest of Zeugma, revealing frescos {{on the walls and}} statues on the terraces in front of the chambers. These statues are now in the Gaziantep Museum of Archaeology. In 1992 the watchman at the site, Nusret Özdemir, reported renewed illegal activity <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> trench dug by antiquity hunters was discovered in the centre of the city. Excavations commenced on the same spot by a team from Gaziantep Museum led by director Rifat Ergeç, uncovered a Roman villa and magnificent mosaic pavements. The 1st century AD villa consisted of galleries around an atrium with eight columns and rooms behind the galleries. The mosaic that adorned the villa's gallery depicted the marriage of Dionysus, god of wine and grapes, to Ariadne. Six of the ten figures portrayed in this mosaic were stolen on 15 June 1998.|$|E
25|$|Playa Las Gatas (Cats Beach) {{is on the}} {{opposite}} side of the bay from town, is accessible only by boat as there are no paved roads that lead to <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> small, poorly defined, rocky footpath leading from Playa La Ropa. Las Gatas was originally named for a small cat shark that used to inhabit these waters. It is located at the entrance to the bay at a place called Punta del Rey (King’s Point). This leaves the area open to ocean breezes. Wave action is stronger, but not as strong as those beaches that face the open ocean as there is a coral reef and a man-made stone barrier in front of it. According to legend, Purépecha chief Calzontzin had a stone barrier built here to keep the waves down and the sea creatures out, creating a kind of swimming pool. Las Gatas is the most popular snorkeling beach in Zihuatanejo. Gear can be rented at Carlo Scuba, along with PADI instruction and certification. Colorful tropical fish can be seen along the man-made breakwater, as well as the abundant coral and sea urchins. At the far end of the beach surfing is possible and a path leads to the lighthouse on the point of the bay.|$|E

The Argylls used the Chartered Bank building in the Crater as their headquarters and snipers stationed on its roof would shoot at anyone thought to represent a threat in the streets below. A BBC journalist wrote [...] "once we stood together in Crater watching the Argylls stacking, as in a butcher's shop, the bodies of four Arab militants they had just shot and Mad Mitch said: 'It was like shooting grouse, a brace <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> brace there'." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Hertfordshire {{changed in the}} later part of the 20th century. [...] In 1992, it was resolved to close the aircraft manufacturing site in Hatfield. [...] At {{the start of the}} 20th century, 83% of the workforce were involved in agriculture, but by the end, less than 1% remained so. Only one brewery, McMullens, is still open and there are no remaining commercial maltings or mills. [...] Nowadays, Hertfordshire has become a service and administrative centre containing the head offices of several important companies (see <b>here)</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> dormitory for London. [...] A growing trend is research and development, notably for Glaxo and at the University of Hertfordshire which, from relatively humble beginnings as Hatfield Polytechnic, now has over 23,000 students.|$|E

The superb observation, and ability to capture expression, makes the anime incredibly fun to watch in addition to meeting the story requirements. The action, and very rich comedy, are also wonderfully represented. There is just so much meaning, and charm, {{in even the most}} minor of expressions." [...] The reviewers of THEM Anime and Anime News Network felt that fans who had already graduated high school would feel nostalgic at times while watching Azumanga Daioh.|$|E

500|$|However, {{dolphins}} {{in these}} areas can also coexist with humans. For example, {{in the town of}} Laguna in south Brazil, a pod of bottlenose dolphins resides in the estuary, and some of its members cooperate with humans. [...] These cooperating dolphins are individually recognized by the local fishermen, who name them. [...] The fishermen typically stand up to their knees in the shallow waters or sit in canoes, waiting for the dolphins. Now and then, one or more dolphins appear, driving the fish towards the line of fishermen. [...] One dolphin then displays a unique body movement outside the water, which serves as a signal to the fishermen to cast their nets (the entire sequence is shown <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> detailed description of the signal's characteristics is available here). [...] In this unique form of cooperation, the dolphins gain because the fish are disoriented and because the fish cannot escape to shallow water where the larger dolphins cannot swim. Likewise, studies show that fishermen casting their nets following the unique signal catch more fish than when fishing alone, without the help of the dolphins. [...] The dolphins were not trained for this behavior; the collaboration began before 1847. Similar cooperative fisheries also exist in Mauritania, Africa.|$|E

2500|$|Things That Happen Again: For a <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> There (1986-1991) was {{installed}} at the Chinati Foundation by Donald Judd and Roni Horn in 1988. The work consists of two identical truncated cones that are 35 inches long, tapering from a diameter of 17 inches to 12 inches. [...] The pair {{is part of a}} 1986-1991 suite consisting of four sets of paired, solid copper forms, each hand-lathed to duplicate mechanical identity. The entire suite is titled Things That Happen Again, and also includes For Two Rooms, For a This and a That, and For Things that are Near. In describing the piece's intention, Horn states the importance of the two objects' apparent duplicity: The narrative involves the recognition of uniqueness through the sequential experience of things which are identical. Then the subsequent and irreversible loss of the unique identity. Obviously the notion of being identical is a purely ideal one since when you have two things, no matter how perfect the identity, you always have a this and a that, a <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> there. In both pieces we’re talking about the critical role of relation in defining the form.|$|E
