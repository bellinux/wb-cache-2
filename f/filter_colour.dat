40|$|We propose an {{accurate}} tracking algorithm {{based on a}} multi-feature statistical model. The model combines in a single particle <b>filter</b> <b>colour</b> and gradient-based orientation information. A reliability measure derived from the particle distribution is used to adaptively weigh {{the contribution of the}} two features. Furthermore, information from the tracker is used to set the dimension of the filters for the computation of the gradient, effectively solving the scale selection problem. Experiments over a set of real-world sequences show that the adaptive use of colour and orientation information improves over either feature taken separately, both in terms of tracking accuracy and of reduction of lost tracks. Also, the automatic scale selection for the derivative filters results in increased robustness. ...|$|E

40|$|Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) {{was widely}} learned nowadays. As crucial parts of ADAS, lane {{markings}} detection, {{as well as}} other objects detection, have become more popular than before. However, most methods implemented in such areas cannot perfectly balance the performance of accuracy versus efficiency, and the mainstream methods (e. g. Machine Learning) suffer from several limitations which can hardly break the wall between partial autonomous and fully autonomous driving. This thesis proposed a real-time lane marking detection framework for ADAS, which included 4 -extreme points set descriptor and a rule-based cascade classifier. By analyzing the behavior of lane markings on the road surface, a characteristic of markings was discovered, i. e., standard markings can sustain their shape in the perpendicular plane of the driving direction. By employing this feature, a 4 -extreme points set descriptor was applied to describe the shape of each marking first. Specifically, after processing Maximally Stable Extremal Region (MSER) and Hough transforms on a 2 -D image, several contours of interest are obtained. A bounding box, with borders parallel to the image coordinate, intersected with each contour at 4 points in the edge, which was named 4 -extreme points set. Afterward, to verify consistency of each contour and standard marking, some rules abstracted from construction manual are employed such as Area <b>Filter,</b> <b>Colour</b> Filter, Relative Location Filter, Convex Filter, etc. To reduce the errors caused by changes in driving direction, an enhanced module was then introduced. By tracking the vanishing point {{as well as other}} key points of the road net, a method for 3 -D reconstruction, with respect to the optical axis between vanishing point and camera center, is possible. The principle of such algorithm was exhibited, and a description about how to obtain the depth information from this model was also provided. Among all of these processes, a key-point based classification method is the main contribution of this paper because of its function in eliminating the deformation of the object caused by inverse perspective mapping. Several experiments were conducted in highway and urban roads in Ottawa. The detection rate of the markings by the proposed algorithm reached an average accuracy rate of 96. 77...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the visual effect of coloured filters compared to transmission-matched neutral density filters, in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration. Methods: Visual acuity (VA, logMAR), contrast sensitivity (Pelli-Robson) and colour vision (D 15) were recorded for 39 patients (average age 79. 1 ± 7. 2 years) with age-related macular degeneration, both in the presence and absence of glare from a fluorescent source. Patients then chose their preferred coloured and matched neutral density transmission filters (NoIR). Visual function tests were repeated with the chosen filters, both in the presence and absence of glare from the fluorescent source. Patients trialled the two filters for two weeks each, in random order. Following the trial of each filter, a telephone questionnaire was completed. Results: VA and contrast sensitivity were unaffected by the coloured filters but reduced through the neutral density filters (p < 0. 01). VA and contrast sensitivity were reduced by similar amounts, following the introduction of the glare source, both in the presence and absence of filters (p < 0. 001). Colour vision error scores were increased following the introduction of a neutral density filter (from 177. 6 ± 60. 2 to 251. 9 ± 115. 2) and still further through coloured filters (275. 1 ± 50. 8; p < 0. 001). In the absence of any <b>filter,</b> <b>colour</b> vision error scores increased by 29. 1 ± 55. 60 units in the presence of glare (F 2, 107 = 3. 9, p = 0. 02); however, there was little change in colour vision error scores, in the presence of glare, with either the neutral density or coloured filters. Questionnaires indicated that patients tended to gain more benefit from the coloured filters. Conclusions: Coloured filters had minimal impact on VA and contrast sensitivity in patients with age-related macular degeneration; however, they caused a small reduction in objective colour vision, although this was not registered subjectively by patients. Patients indicated that they received more benefit from the coloured filters compared with neutral density filters. © 2013 The Authors © 2013 Optometrists Association Australia...|$|E

25|$|Rows 1–4 of the midband are {{specialised}} for colour vision, from ultraviolet to longer wavelengths. Their UV vision {{can detect}} five different frequency bands {{in the deep}} ultraviolet. To do this they use two photoreceptors in combination with four different <b>colour</b> <b>filters.</b> They are not currently believed {{to be sensitive to}} infrared light. The optical elements in these rows have eight different classes of visual pigments and the rhabdom (area of eye that absorbs light from a single direction) is divided into three different pigmented layers (tiers), each for different wavelengths. The three tiers in rows 2 and 3 are separated by <b>colour</b> <b>filters</b> (intrarhabdomal filters) that can be divided into four distinct classes, two classes in each row.

These <b>colour</b> <b>filters</b> allow the mantis shrimp to see with diverse colour vision. Without the filters, the pigments themselves range only a small segment of the visual spectrum: about 490-550nm. Rows 5–6 are also segregated into different tiers, but have only one class of visual pigment (a ninth class) and are specialised for polarisation vision. They can detect different planes of polarised light. A tenth class of visual pigment is found in the upper and lower hemispheres of the eye.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This work proposes colour {{opponent}} {{features that}} are based on low-level models of mammalian colour visual processing. A key step is the construc-tion of opponent spatio-chromatic feature maps by <b>filtering</b> <b>colour</b> planes with Gaussians of unequal spreads. Weighted combination of these planes yields a spatial center-surround effect across chromatic channels. The resulting feature spaces – substantially different to CIELAB and other colour-opponent spaces obtained by colour-plane differencing – are further processed to assign local spa-tial orientations. The nature of the initial spatio-chromatic processing requires a customised approach to generating gradient-like fields, which is also described. The resulting direction-encoding responses are then pooled to form compact de-scriptors. The individual performance of the new descriptors was found to be substantially higher than those arising from spatial processing of standard oppo-nent colour spaces, and these are the first chromatic descriptors that appear to achieve such performance levels individually. For all stages, parametrisations are suggested that allow successful optimisation using categorization performance as an objective. Classification benchmarks on Pascal VOC 2007 and Bird- 200 - 2011 are presented to show the merits of these new features...|$|R
