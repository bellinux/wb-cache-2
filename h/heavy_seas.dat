5|$|Amazon {{lost three}} in the battle and six in her wreck, with 15 wounded, while Indefatigable did not lose a single man killed, {{suffering}} only 18wounded. The discrepancy in losses during the action is likely due to the extreme difficulty the French crew had in aiming their guns given their ship's instability in <b>heavy</b> <b>seas.</b>|$|E
5|$|Designed {{within the}} tight 35,000 ton {{limitations}} of the Washington Naval Treaty, wartime service necessitated increases over the design displacement, seriously reducing freeboard and affecting seaworthiness. This was most acute at the already low bow. With too little buoyancy forward the bows were easily buried even in moderate seas, with spray washing up over both forward turrets. <b>Heavy</b> <b>seas</b> could flood ‘A’ turret, drenching both men and machinery within.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hurricane}} of {{the season}} was observed on July11, when a schooner encountered <b>heavy</b> <b>seas</b> {{to the south of}} the Florida Panhandle. As the hurricane moved westward, it remained a short distance off the Gulf Coast of the United States, bringing strong winds to New Orleans on July12. High tides surrounded the lighthouse at Timbalier Bay for about 24hours, prompting the lighthouse keeper to resign from loneliness and from fear of the weather.|$|E

5|$|The storm made {{launching}} the lifeboats almost impossible. At about 3:00am, Captain Pearce ordered the two port lifeboats lowered, each with four crew on board. While being passed astern {{one of the}} boats broke the painter and became adrift. Her crew tried hard to {{pull up to the}} ship's side, but it was impossible in the heavy squall. The other was accidentally let go and both boats, in <b>heavy</b> <b>seas,</b> were unable to be retrieved.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression {{formed in the}} western Gulf of Mexico on September14 and moved eastward. The storm produced <b>heavy</b> <b>seas</b> across the region, which damaged two small boats. After turning to the northeast, the storm reached peak winds of , followed by executing a clockwise loop from September16 through September18. After maintaining peak winds for about five days, the storm weakened, by which time it curved to the northeast. On September20, it moved ashore in Taylor County, Florida and later crossed the state. The storm dissipated on September21 just off the Georgia coast.|$|E
5|$|Asar-i Tevfik {{served in}} the Ottoman fleet {{for more than four}} decades. During this period, she saw action in two major wars, the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 and the First Balkan War in 1913. During the first conflict, she was torpedoed by a Russian torpedo boat but was only {{slightly}} damaged. She took part in the abortive Battle of Elli against the Greek Navy in December 1912 during the First Balkan War. While operating against Bulgarian positions in February 1913, she ran aground; Bulgarian field artillery then shelled the ship. The damage they inflicted, coupled with <b>heavy</b> <b>seas,</b> destroyed the ship.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the chiral SU(n) ⊗ SU(n) flavor {{symmetry}} on the null-plane severely restricts the sea quarks in the baryon octet. It predicts large asymmetry for the light sea quarks (u,d,s), and universality and abundance for the <b>heavy</b> <b>sea</b> quarks. Further it is shown that existence of the <b>heavy</b> <b>sea</b> quarks constrained by the same symmetry reduces the theoretical value of the Ellis-Jaffe sum rule substantially. ...|$|R

5|$|Offshore, {{eight people}} were injured on the U.S. Naval ship Kirk when a large wave crashed over the bow. Another boat, USB Oldendorf, {{sustained}} significant damage due to the <b>heavy</b> <b>seas,</b> and 22of its occupants required rescue. Many of the rescued received minor injuries. A total of 13people were rescued from the imperiled ship Offshore Patrick. Following the passage of Typhoon Hal in the Philippines, 4,000bags of food, 200bags of clothes, and 400bags of medicine were provided via airlift. A few days after Hal, the nation was later affected by Typhoon Irma.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 13 January 1797 {{was a minor}} naval battle fought {{between a}} French ship {{of the line and}} two British frigates off the coast of Brittany during the French Revolutionary Wars. During the action the frigates outmanoeuvred the much larger French vessel and drove it onto shore in <b>heavy</b> <b>seas,</b> {{resulting}} in the deaths of between 400 and 1,000 of the 1,300persons aboard. One of the British frigates was also lost in the engagement with six sailors drowned after running onto a sandbank while failing to escape a lee shore.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{damaged or}} wrecked numerous vessels. Six ships were wrecked or {{grounded in the}} Bahamas, and the crews of at least two, the John Stanley and the Linea, had to be rescued. The steamship Santiago de Cuba left port on August 4, and began to encounter squally conditions later that afternoon. <b>Heavy</b> <b>seas</b> and a strong gale inflicted some damage on the vessel. Several ships along the eastern coast of Cuba were wrecked during the storm, leading to great uncertainty and concern regarding {{the fate of the}} Santiago. At least three vessels were lost or grounded along the Florida Keys.|$|E

5|$|There {{were some}} {{significant}} {{problems with the}} casemate guns early on, however. They were equipped with hinged plates that were designed to close off the casemate opening in <b>heavy</b> <b>seas.</b> The plates were easily washed away, though, and without them, water easily entered the ship and caused significant flooding. This problem was {{compounded by the fact}} that they had been mounted too low in the hull, which subjected them to heavier pounding from rough seas. The problem was eventually corrected by the addition of dwarf bulkheads in the gun houses and rubber seals to the hinged plates.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of battle damage and casualties, Langsdorff decided to put into Montevideo, where repairs could be {{effected}} and the wounded men could be evacuated from the ship. Most of the hits scored by the British cruisers caused only minor structural and superficial damage but the oil purification plant, which was required to prepare the diesel fuel for the engines, was destroyed. Her desalination plant and galley were also destroyed, which would have increased the difficulty {{of a return to}} Germany. A hit in the bow would also have negatively affected her seaworthiness in the <b>heavy</b> <b>seas</b> of the North Atlantic. Admiral Graf Spee had fired much of her ammunition in the engagement with Harwood's cruisers.|$|E
5|$|As designed, {{the ships}} did not handle {{particularly}} well, even in calm seas, and their motion was quite stiff. The ships experienced severe rolling, {{due to the}} weight of the wing turrets. The heavy wing turrets caused the ships to have a large metacentric height, which should have made them very stable gun platforms, but their roll period proved to coincide with that of the average North Sea swell. Bilge keels were later added, which helped to improve the rolling problem. Despite the tendency to roll, the Nassau-class ships were maneuverable and had a small turning radius. They suffered minor speed loss in <b>heavy</b> <b>seas,</b> but up to 70percent at hard rudder. The roll keels that had been fitted to improve handling caused a portion of the speed loss at hard rudder.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} March 1978, Melbourne left Sydney for RIMPAC 78. During this exercise, Melbourne {{acquired}} the nickname 'Little M' after working with 'Big E' —the smallest and largest aircraft carriers (respectively) in operation at the time. On return in July, the carrier entered a major refit, which continued until 3 August 1979. During this refit, on 3 March, a boiler explosion caused minor damage to the carrier. The remainder of the year involved participation in three exercises, Tasmanex off Wellington, New Zealand, Sea Eagle I in the Tasman Sea, and Kangaroo III in the Coral Sea. During Tasmanex, Melbourne lost her LW-02 radar aerial and a Skyhawk, both of which fell overboard during <b>heavy</b> <b>seas.</b>|$|E
5|$|The USCG cited topside damage as a {{reasonable}} alternative reason for Fitzgerald sinking and surmised that {{damage to the}} fence rail and vents was possibly caused by a heavy floating object such as a log. Historian and mariner Mark Thompson believes that something broke loose from Fitzgeralds deck. He theorized {{that the loss of}} the vents resulted in flooding of two ballast tanks or a ballast tank and a walking tunnel that caused the ship to list. Thompson further conjectured that damage more extensive than Captain McSorley could detect in the pilothouse let water flood the cargo hold. He concluded that the topside damage Fitzgerald experienced at 3:30p.m. on November 10, compounded by the <b>heavy</b> <b>seas,</b> was the most obvious explanation for why she sank.|$|E
5|$|The {{bombardment}} {{was scheduled}} to cease immediately before the assault companies deployed on Juno, but due to <b>heavy</b> <b>seas,</b> the landing was delayed by ten minutes, to 07:45 in Mike sector and 07:55 in Nan Sector. This was at a slightly higher tide, closer to the beach obstacles and mines. The LCTs carrying the field artillery were forced to adjust course to avoid landing too early; the LCTs carrying DD tanks were forced to break off their advance. The seas proved too rough to launch the DD tanks, so they were ordered to deploy from the LCTs several hundred yards out from the beach.|$|E

5|$|The {{major part}} of the {{subsequent}} attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in <b>heavy</b> <b>seas,</b> and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} Indiana class included bilge keels, but with keels they would not fit {{in any of the}} American drydocks at the time, so they were omitted during construction. This meant a reduction in stability and caused a serious problem for Indiana, when both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in <b>heavy</b> <b>seas</b> a year after being commissioned. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy ropes. When the ship encountered more bad weather four months later, she promptly steamed back to port for fear the clamps would break again. This convinced the navy that bilge keels were necessary and they were subsequently installed on all three ships.|$|E
5|$|The ships used {{transverse}} and longitudinal steel frames in the hull. They {{had eight}} watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 60% of the hull. After the refits, one more watertight compartment was added. The ships {{were described as}} good sea boats; they had gentle motion and were very responsive to commands from the helm. The ships lost significant speed in <b>heavy</b> <b>seas,</b> however. The ships had a crew of 20 officers and 256 enlisted men, with an additional 6 officers and 22 men when serving as a flagship. The refit increased crew requirements, to an additional 31 sailors normally, and the extra flagship crew increased to 9 officers and 34 men. The ships carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one pinnace, two cutters, one yawl, and one dinghy.|$|E
