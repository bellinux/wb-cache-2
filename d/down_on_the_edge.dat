500|$|At 06:00 {{artillery}} commenced bombarding the position, {{and following}} a half-hour of preparation, 5 Platoon resumed its advance expecting the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese to have vacated the position during the night, {{as they had}} done numerous times in the past. However, after having proceeded only [...] the Australians {{came under heavy fire}} from the front and both flanks, suffering several casualties in the initial volleys. It soon became apparent that the platoon was pinned <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of a strongly defended and well-concealed bunker system, with the platoon commander calling for assistance from helicopter gunships, as well as indirect mortar fire rather than risking further casualties by withdrawing.|$|E
2500|$|There was no pretense {{that this}} was a South Vietnamese cargo operation, nor was there any {{training}} of Vietnamese for the task. Vietnamese were employed as [...] "kickers" [...] to move the cargo out the rear on re-supply drop. [...] The C-123 was a relatively simple and rugged aircraft. Its systems could take the heat and humidity of Vietnam better than more sophisticated aircraft. Tough landing gear and glider-strong fuselage could take the rough landings on short airfields, where stopping depended upon a slow approach, touching <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the airstrip, then full reverse and a steady, heavy foot on the anti-skid brakes.|$|E
2500|$|Tunisia {{players and}} {{supporters}} {{claim that the}} Paraguayan referee Carlos Amarilla failed to award Tunisia a penalty kick {{in the second half}} and then mistakenly awarded one to Ukraine, which when converted by Andriy Shevchenko resulted in the 1–0 win and qualification by Ukraine to the second round. [...] At the time Tunisia was playing with 10 men since Ziad Jaziri was sent off for his second yellow card in the last minute of the first half. The German magazine Spiegel Online described the turn of events this way: [...] "Tunisia went close on 65 minutes after Namouchi was hacked <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the box. Ayari's left footed free kick deflected off Voronin in the Ukrainian wall and crept just over the bar. Replays suggested the ball hit Voronin's elbow and Tunisia could feel aggrieved not to have been awarded a penalty. Then almost immediately the action switched to the other end when Shevchenko stumbled into the penalty area only to be brought down by Haggui. This time replays suggested Shevchenko fell over his own feet but Amarilla pointed to the spot and Shevchenko made no mistake with the penalty kick. It was tough luck for the Tunisians with two dodgy decisions costing the team badly and with only ten men left on the field the game looked beyond them." ...|$|E
