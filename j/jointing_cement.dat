Fifty-two total hip replacements (THR) were carried out in 30 patients. The mean follow-up was 11 years (range 5 - 17, SD 3. 4). The mean age at operation was 27 years (range 17 - 35). The modified Charnley-Merle-d’Aubigné score improved from 8. 2 to 16. 5 after the operation. All patients had a cemented doubled tapered polished femoral component. There were 11 cemented and 41 uncemented cups. One patient who had a bilateral single stage THR died 8 years after the index operation with both prostheses functioning well. In the remaining 29 patients with 50 THR there were no revisions of any cemented stem. There were 3 revisions of cemented cups respectively 11, 13 and 16 years postoperatively. All cups were revised to an uncemented cup. One uncemented cup showed an osteolytic lesion in zone II. Although the uncemented cups had a slightly shorter follow-up there were less radiolucencies and no revisions in the uncemented cups compared to their cemented opponents.

This work aims at studying AISI 316 L/bone cement friction which is a tribological problem related to hip <b>joint</b> <b>cemented</b> prostheses. This study focuses on the ionic strength effect on the tribological behaviour of 316 L/bone cement and 316 L/PMMA contacts. PMMA, poly(methylmethacrylate), {{can be considered as}} a model material for bone cement because of vicinity of mechanical properties and PMMA transparency. Pin on disk friction tests were investigated, in different media with NaCl concentration increasing. Friction coefficient and free corrosion potential of 316 L sample were monitored. Moreover, SEM-FEG and microraman spectroscopy analyses were investigated on samples surfaces. Friction coefficient evolution according to ionic strength, for 316 L/bone cement and 316 L/PMMA contacts, are opposite. Indeed, when the ionic strength increases, the friction coefficient growths (decreases), for 316 L/PMMA contact (for 316 L/bone cement contact). The free corrosion potential decreases in both cases but more drastically for 316 L/PMMA contact with ionic strength increasing. One might suggest that ions adsorption on 316 L and PMMA surfaces involves attraction between surfaces in contact. On the contrary, ions adsorption on bone cement has no effect in terms of surface attraction forces, the gap between surfaces is too big due to roughness of bone cement. If ions concentration increases, the tribofilm viscosity between 316 L and bone cement could increase. Attraction forces between surfaces are the less significant phenomenon compared to lubricant effect of tribofilm, 316 L/bone cement contact. SEM-FEG analysis highlighted principally deep grooves on 316 L surface, corrosive wear after destruction of passive film by friction. Finally microraman spectroscopy results, on metal surface, show principally Fe 3 O 4 and Cr 2 O 3 oxides deposits.

Group 2 involved partial ossicular reconstruction between the stapes and malleus handle with HABC. Group 3 was divided into two subgroups. Group 3 B entailed reconstruction of the stapes with a mobile footplate (Austin-Kartush type B = group 3 B) and group 3 F with a fixed footplate (Austin-Kartush type F = group 3 F) using a K-Helix piston (Grace Medical, Memphis, TN, USA) or a classical titanium piston (Kurz, Fuerth, Germany) glued to the incus remnant or malleus handle with cement. Anatomical and pre- and postoperative audiological results were assessed. The mean follow-up was 26  ±  14  months. Percentages of average postoperative air-bone gap ≤ 20  dB were 95, 82. 5, 50 and 83. 3  %, and for air-bone gap ≤ 10  dB, 80, 50. 9, 16. 6 and 50  % for groups 1, 2, 3 B and 3 F, respectively.

Inclined abutment or angling the screw channel can be an option to ameliorate the aesthetical outcomes [17, 18]. Moving the access hole to an occlusal or palatal/lingual zone would increase the indication of screw retained implant restoration. The development of the computer-assisted implant surgery increases the use of the screw-retained prosthesis compared to the cement retained method [19, 20]. Nevertheless, the integrity of the filling of the access hole is necessary to preserve to occlusal function and the aesthetic outcomes. Moreover, the access hole filling contributes to reinforce the surrounding ceramic [9].|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the present work is to {{increase}} knowledge of in-plane tension behav-iour of masonry and develop a model able to describe the impact of parameters influencing cracking caused by restrained shrinkage. In the process the mechanism of load transfer between units and mortar joints is described. The influence of cohesion between units and mortar joints, unit and joint geometry and external loads on the mechanical properties of masonry and the response to in-plane loading is studied. It is concluded that, in order to obtain a realistic in-plane tension behaviour, tension and shear softening of the mortar joints must be included in the masonry model. A discontinuum model, implying discrete model-ling of units and mortar joints, is employed to reproduce masonry behaviour in crack zones. Where cracking is not expected, masonry is modelled as an elastic continuum. The model has been implemented in a commercial finite element programme. To obtain realistic data for the simulations, two types of clay bricks and three types of mor-tars were tested. Measurement of natural frequencies by a non-destructive method and direct tension tests up to failure were carried out. The moduli of elasticity determined by the two methods showed good agreement. Deformation controlled shear tests, at three different levels of normal pre-compression, were carried out on <b>joints,</b> with <b>cement</b> respectively lime rich mortars. The joints with the lime rich mortar exhibited more deformation in the pre-peak stage and a slower diminishing of the load bearing capacity in the post-peak stage compared to the cement rich mortar. Three-point bending tests were carried out on beams consisting of glulam at the ends and masonry in the central parts. Perforated bricks with a cement respectively lime rich mortar were used – testing with massive bricks was not possi-ble due to pre-mature failure caused by low bending strength in the joints. The mode I fracture energy of the mortar joints manufactured with the lime rich mortar was 50 % com-pared to the <b>joints</b> with <b>cement</b> rich mortars. Simulation of retrained shrinkage on massive, one-storey masonry walls with one-sided restraint show that application of slip joints between the wall and obstructing foundation has the strongest crack delaying effect. A shift from the strong cement rich mortar to the lime rich mortar allows the spacing of vertical movement joints to be increased by 10 %. Cracking in walls with openings occur at approximately 40 % lower imposed shrinkage levels than in massive walls. Cracking at windows located at the end of walls longer than 7 m can not be avoided be application of vertical movement joints...|$|R

Several researchers have suggested that the damage initiation in a replaced joint is a mechanical phenomenon primarily taking place in the vicinity of cement-prosthesis interface. In this study, the fracture behavior of a crack at the interface of cement-prosthesis was investigated both experimentally and theoretically under static loading conditions. The finite element method, and then the maximum tangential stress (MTS) and the generalized MTS (GMTS) criteria were used for theoretical study of interface fracture. Some experiments were also carried out to investigate the effect of cement mixing methods (hand mixing and vacuum mixing) on crack growth pattern. The results showed that the vacuum-mixed cement led to self-similar crack growth along the cement-prosthesis interface, while the crack kinked into the cement in the samples prepared by hand-mixed cement. Then some experiments were performed to verify the theoretical results obtained for mixed mode fracture angles in the samples prepared by hand-mixed cement. The sandwich Brazilian disk model was used in both finite element and experimental approaches to simulate the cement-prosthesis interface. The experimental results were found to be in good agreement with those predicted by the GMTS criterion...|$|R
40|$|Cemented {{carbides}} are multiphase materials {{composed of}} refractory metal carbides e. g. WC, TiC {{embedded in a}} metallic binder (Co, Ni, Fe). Due to their high hardness and superior wear resistance, cemented carbides {{are used in the}} production of tools for cutting, machining and milling. Because cemented carbides are brittle and expensive materials, it can be favourable to join them to steel substrates, e. g. in case of saw blades for wood machining applications, where cemented carbides are used as saw tooth tip. Welding of dissimilar materials such as steel and cemented carbides (hardmetals, cermets) is particularly challenging because mismatches in their thermal expansion coefficients and thermal conductivities result in build-up of residual stress as well as the formation of brittle intermetallic phases (e. g. M 6 C and M 12 C) at the cemented carbide/steel interface due to the diffusion of C from the cemented carbides into the steel [1].

40|$|Total joint {{arthroplasty}} is {{a highly}} successful way to restore pain free function to patients afflicted with arthritis. Poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement is commonly used as a fixing agent in artificial joints. The historical success rate on patients over 60 years (in a ten year time frame) exceeds 90 %. Loosening is often preceded by the fracture of the bone cement, which will inevitably lead to a prosthesis failure and require a revision surgery. Bone cement used for total joint surgeries has not changed significantly since first introduced in the 1960 's.
