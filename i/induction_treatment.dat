PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively the clinical course of 169 adult patients with AML treated by standard dose Ara-C-containing induction regimens, either by continuous venous infusion (group 1) or subcutaneous injection (group 2). Ultrasonography was employed as early diagnostic tool in a majority of patients with gastroenteric complications.

HCMV DNA was quantified by PCR using densitometric analysis of hybridization products obtained from external standards and a standard curve from which the number of genome equivalents of test samples, normalized by using an internal amplification control, was interpolated.

Finally, of the nine patients (13. 8 %) with DNA-negative blood prior to <b>induction</b> <b>treatment,</b> three were shifted to foscarnet from ganciclovir, while six were erroneously enrolled in the study.

Methods: In 13 patients with de novo AML, markers of coagulation were determined before <b>induction</b> <b>treatment</b> and daily for 13 days. Results: At start, Hb and platelets were low and levels diminished during induction therapy. INR was elevated at days 3 - 5 and APTT was prolonged at days 13 - 14.

The sample-size formula reduces to Eng and Kosorok's sample-size formula for a two-sample supremum log-rank test when there is no second randomization.
