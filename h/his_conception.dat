5|$|He found birdsong fascinating, notating bird songs {{worldwide}} and incorporating birdsong transcriptions into his music. His innovative use of colour, <b>his</b> <b>conception</b> {{of the relationship}} between time and music, and his use of birdsong are among the features that make Messiaen's music distinctive.|$|E
5|$|Essai is {{considered}} the first complete treatise on economics, with numerous contributions to the science. These contributions include: his cause and effect methodology, monetary theories, <b>his</b> <b>conception</b> of the entrepreneur as a risk-bearer, {{and the development of}} spatial economics. Cantillon's Essai had significant influence on the early development of political economy, including the works of Adam Smith, Anne Turgot, Jean-Baptiste Say, Frédéric Bastiat and François Quesnay.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>conception</b> of 'marvellous reality' {{revolves}} around the natural fantastic qualities of Latin America and the Caribbean, {{as opposed to the}} overly forced and cliché efforts by European surrealists to portray magical occurrences. The result was the presentation of impossible or fantastic events described as if they were completely usual and natural, such as the metamorphoses of Mackandal and Ti Noel. These events, however, often represent the beliefs of other characters in the novel. For a more detailed account of the differences between magic realism and Carpentier's real maravilloso, see the page on magic realism.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th {{century the}} {{well-known}} Tertön Pema Lingpa of Bumthang, who founded many monasteries {{in various parts}} of Bhutan, was also instrumental in creating religious and secular dance forms from <b>his</b> <b>conception</b> of the 'Zandog Pelri' (the Copper Colored mountain), which was the abode of the Guru Padmasambahva (which is the same place as the Paro Taktsang or Tiger's nest). This dance is performed in Paro as the Tsche festival. But it was during the time of Ngawang Namgyal of the Drukpa subsect, who fled Tibet to escape persecution by the opposing sect of the Gelugpa order (which dominated Tibet under the Dalai Lamas), that an administrative mechanism was established in Bhutan.|$|E

25|$|With the Prior Analytics, Aristotle is {{credited}} with the earliest study of formal logic, and <b>his</b> <b>conception</b> of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th century advances in mathematical logic. Kant stated in the Critique of Pure Reason (Preface to the Second Edition, 1787) that with Aristotle logic reached its completion.|$|E

In his 25 years in office, many of <b>his</b> <b>conceptions</b> became {{the model for}} the development of art universities in Indonesia.|$|R
25|$|Interrelatedness – Adler {{used the}} term The Ethical Manifold to refer to <b>his</b> <b>conception</b> of the {{universe}} as made up of myriad unique and indispensable moral agents (individual human beings), each of whom has an inestimable influence on all the others. In other words, we are all interrelated, with each person {{playing a role in}} the whole and the whole affecting each person. Our interrelatedness {{is at the heart of}} ethics.|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{an essay}} {{regarding}} Goodwin’s conception by Margaret Boden in 1980, the next appearance of ‘cognitive biology’ as a phrase {{in the literature}} came in 1986 from a professor of biochemistry, Ladislav Kováč. <b>His</b> <b>conception,</b> based on natural principles grounded in bioenergetics and molecular biology, is briefly discussed below. Kováč’s continued advocacy has had a greater influence in his homeland, Slovakia, than elsewhere partly because several of his most important papers were written and published only in Slovakian.|$|E
25|$|According to <b>his</b> <b>conception,</b> God {{changes the}} natural order of things only when He wishes to verify before all people the words of a prophet (Teshubot ha-Ge'onim, ed. Lyck, No. 99). This view was opposed by his {{son-in-law}} Hai Gaon. That in later times he was not termed a heretic, although disparaging criticism was not lacking, was due to his position as gaon (see Weiss, l.c. iv. 198; Menahem Me'iri, Bet ha-Beḥirah, in Adolf Neubauer, M. J. C. ii. 225).|$|E
6000|$|He was a Creole, <b>his</b> <b>conceptions</b> of {{etiquette}} {{and discipline}} were pure-blooded Portuguese, {{and it was}} only to Holroyd, the Lancashire engineer who had come over with the boat, and as an exercise in the use of English--his [...] "th" [...] sounds were very uncertain--that he opened his heart.|$|R

5000|$|Michael or Michel Riffaterre (20 November 1924, Bourganeuf, Creuse [...] - [...] 27 May 2006, New York) was an {{influential}} French literary critic and theorist. He pursued a generally structuralist approach. He {{is well known}} in particular for his book Semiotics of Poetry, and <b>his</b> <b>conceptions</b> of hypogram and syllepsis.|$|R
25|$|Betweenness is a {{centrality}} {{measure of}} a vertex within a graph (there is also edge betweenness, which is not discussed here). Betweenness centrality quantifies {{the number of times}} a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes. It was introduced as a measure for quantifying the control of a human on the communication between other humans in a social network by Linton Freeman In <b>his</b> <b>conception,</b> vertices that have a high probability to occur on a randomly chosen shortest path between two randomly chosen vertices have a high betweenness.|$|E
25|$|Harris {{rejects the}} {{dichotomy}} between religious spirituality {{on the one}} hand and scientific rationality on the other, and favors a middle path that preserves spirituality and science but does not involve religion. He writes that spirituality should be understood in light of scientific disciplines like neuroscience and psychology. Science, he contends, can show how to maximize human well-being but may fail to answer certain questions about the nature of being, answers to some of which he says are discoverable directly through our experience. <b>His</b> <b>conception</b> of spirituality does not involve a belief in God.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{impact of}} Dickens's episodic writing style resulted from his {{exposure to the}} opinions of his readers and friends. His friend Forster had a significant hand in reviewing his drafts, an influence that went beyond matters of punctuation. He toned down melodramatic and sensationalist exaggerations, cut long passages (such as the episode of Quilp's drowning in The Old Curiosity Shop), and made suggestions about plot and character. It was he who suggested that Charley Bates should be redeemed in Oliver Twist. Dickens had not thought of killing Little Nell, and it was Forster who advised him to entertain this possibility as necessary to <b>his</b> <b>conception</b> of the heroine.|$|E
50|$|M. von Engelhardt has {{attempted}} to extend this line of treatment to Justin's entire theology, and to show that <b>his</b> <b>conceptions</b> of God, of free will and righteousness, of redemption, grace, and merit prove {{the influence of the}} cultivated Greek pagan world of the 2nd century, dominated by the Platonic and Stoic philosophy.|$|R
50|$|His {{obituary}} in Gentleman’s Magazine declared: As a poet, Fitzpatrick is {{deserving of}} considerable praise. The smoothness of his verse and the justness of <b>his</b> <b>conceptions</b> are greatly to be admired. Thousands have feasted on his poetry, in total ignorance of its author. As {{he was a}} politician without ambition, he was a poet without vanity.|$|R
50|$|Westheimer also {{engaged in}} travel while {{studying}} at Princeton, {{and spent a}} half-year working as a computer programmer in Argentina. He {{became interested in the}} political scene in the country, which was vastly different from the USA. His time there helped formulated <b>his</b> <b>conceptions</b> of civic education and social movements, as he witnessed protests and Argentina’s political recovery.|$|R
25|$|As a result, White {{frequently}} championed {{nineteenth century}} evolutionists {{in a search}} for intellectual predecessors unclaimed or denounced by Boasians. This stance can be clearly seen in his views of evolution, which are firmly rooted in the writings of Herbert Spencer, Charles Darwin, and Lewis H. Morgan. While {{it can be argued that}} White's exposition of Morgan and Spencer's was tendentious, it can be safely said that White's concepts of science and evolution were firmly rooted in their work. Advances in population biology and evolutionary theory passed White by and, unlike Steward, <b>his</b> <b>conception</b> of evolution and progress remained firmly rooted in the nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Valjean carries Marius {{through the}} sewers but collapses in exhaustion. While he is {{unconscious}}, Thénardier, {{who has been}} looting bodies ("Dog Eats Dog"), comes upon them and takes a ring from the unconscious Marius, but flees when Valjean (whom he again recognizes) regains consciousness. When Valjean carries Marius to the sewer's exit, he finds Javert waiting for him. Valjean begs Javert for one hour to bring Marius to a doctor, and Javert reluctantly agrees. Javert finds himself unable to reconcile Valjean's merciful acts with <b>his</b> <b>conception</b> of Valjean as an irredeemable criminal. Refusing to compromise his principles but {{no longer able to}} hold them sacred, he finds himself torn between his beliefs about God and his desire to adhere to the law and commits suicide by throwing himself into the Seine ("Soliloquy – Javert's Suicide").|$|E
25|$|The Neo-Platonic {{interpretation}} of Plato prevailed until the beginning {{the nineteenth century}} when in 1804 Friedrich Schleiermacher published an introduction to his 1804 translation of Plato's dialogues and initiated a radical turn whose consequences are still felt today. Schleiermacher {{was convinced that the}} entire content of Plato's philosophy was contained in his dialogues. There never was, he insisted, any oral teaching that went beyond them. According to <b>his</b> <b>conception,</b> the genre of the dialogue is no literary replacement for Plato's philosophy, rather the literary form of the dialogue and the content of Plato's philosophy are inseparably bound together: Plato's way of philosophizing can by its nature only be represented as a literary dialogue. Therefore, unwritten doctrines with any philosophically relevant, special content that are not bound together into a literary dialogue must be excluded.|$|E
6000|$|... 205. These, accordingly, are {{the chief}} {{characteristics}} {{of the works of}} Turner's second period, as distinguished from the first,--a new energy inherent {{in the mind of the}} painter, diminishing the repose and exalting the force and fire of <b>his</b> <b>conceptions,</b> and the presence of Color, as at least an essential, and often a principal, element of design.|$|R

25|$|Mark was {{traditionally}} placed second, and sometimes fourth, in the Christian canon, as a somewhat inferior abridgement {{of what was}} regarded {{as the most important}} gospel, Matthew. The Church has consequently derived its view of Jesus primarily from Matthew, secondarily from John, and only distantly from Mark. It was only in the 19th century that Mark came to be seen as the earliest of the four gospels, and as a source used by both Matthew and Luke. The hypothesis of Markan priority (that Mark was written first) continues to be held by the majority of scholars today, and there is a new recognition of the author as an artist and theologian using a range of literary devices to convey <b>his</b> <b>conception</b> of Jesus as the authoritative yet suffering Son of God.|$|E
25|$|Appiah {{has been}} {{influenced}} by the cosmopolitanist philosophical tradition, which stretches from German philosophers such as Hegel through W. E. B. Du Bois and others. In his article “Education for Global Citizenship”, Appiah outlines <b>his</b> <b>conception</b> of cosmopolitanism. He therein defines cosmopolitanism as “universality plus difference”. Building from this definition, he asserts that the first takes precedence over the latter, that is: different cultures are respected “not because cultures matter in themselves, but because people matter, and culture matters to people.” But Appiah first defined it as its problems but ultimately determines that practicing a citizenship of the world and conversation is not only helpful in a post-9/11 world. Therefore, according to Appiah’s take on this ideology, cultural differences are to be respected in so far as they are not harmful to people and in no way conflict with our universal concern for every human’s life and well-being.|$|E
25|$|It will {{be borne}} {{in mind that}} the Liberal doctrines of that time, with their violent anti-socialist spirit and their strong insistence on the gospel of thrift, self-help, {{settlement}} of wages by the higgling of the market, and non-interference by the State.... I think that Mr. Gladstone was the strongest anti-socialist that I have ever known among persons who gave any serious thought to social and political questions. It is quite true, as has been often said, that “we are all socialists up to a certain point”; but Mr. Gladstone fixed that point lower, and was more vehement against those who went above it, than any other politician or official of my acquaintance. I remember his speaking indignantly to me of the budget of 1874 as “That socialistic budget of Northcote's,” merely because of the special relief which it gave to the poorer class of income-tax payers. His strong belief in Free Trade was only one of the results of his deep-rooted conviction that the Government's interference with the free action of the individual, whether by taxation or otherwise, should be kept at an irreducible minimum. It is, indeed, not too much to say that <b>his</b> <b>conception</b> of Liberalism was the negation of Socialism.|$|E

25|$|Mr. Schmitt’s work {{brings to}} mind {{momentary}} flashes of such great painters as Botticelli, El Greco, and Rembrandt, or the quiet reaches of Puvis de Chavannes.
