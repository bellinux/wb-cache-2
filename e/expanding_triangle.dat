Drawing on data from a study with first year university students learning introductory chemistry, this chapter looks at how these students’ understandings of the characteristics of chemistry influence the way they understand and learn chemistry. Two theoretical frameworks to describe how chemical concepts can be presented and understood are developed based on the research data: the <b>expanding</b> <b>triangle</b> and the rising iceberg. The aim of the frameworks are to further develop the ways of thinking about how students learn chemistry thereby developing a chemical epistemology – that is, an understanding of the knowledge of how chemical ideas are built and an understanding of the way of knowing about chemical processes. These two frameworks are proposed as useful tools for chemistry educators to better understand students learning, linking chemical education research to practice so as to inform pedagogical content knowledge. Chemical education research can be theoretical and is sometimes criticised for not impacting on teachers practice, so the pedagogy of chemistry teachers is discussed with the aim of exploring ways the two frameworks can be useful in developing teachers’ professional understandings of learning and teaching chemistry to promote changes in their practice and support student understandings...|$|E

The effect of the forming mode and the loading paths on bulged profile, wall-thickness distribution and the potential fracture location of the bulged tube are analyzed. The results showed that constraint conditions at tube ends have small influence on the bulged profile and wall-thickness distribution. Moreover, the larger the peak value of the internal pressure is, the better material filling ability and higher accurate the tube bulged profile are. Furthermore, the higher forming accuracy, the better material filling ability and wall-thickness distribution are gained in THFRC than those in free hydro-bulging (FHB) process, and they can be obtained under constant than linear pressure loading paths. Finally, the potential fracture location of the bulged tube in THFRC process is quite different from that in FHB process...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{proposed}} flight {{research at}} NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) has prompted study into the aerodynamic effects of modifications {{made to the}} surfaces of laminar airfoils. The research {{is focused on the}} high-aspect ratio, laminar-flow type wings commonly found on UAVs and other aircraft with a high endurance requirement. A broad range of instrumentation possibilities, such as structural, pressure, and temperature sensing devices may require the alteration of the airfoil outer mold line as part of the installation process. This study attempts to characterize the effect of installing this additiona 1 instrumentation on key airfoil performance factors, such as transition location, lift and drag curves, and stall point. In particular, the general case of an airfoil that is channeled in the spanwise direction is considered, and the impact on key performance characteristics is assessed. Particular attention is focused on exploring the limits of channel depth and low-Reynolds number on performance and stall characteristics. To quantify the effect of increased skin friction due to premature transition caused by protruding or recessed instrumentation, two simplified, conservative scenarios are used to consider two potential sources of diaturbance: A) that leading edge alterations would cause linearly <b>expanding</b> areas (<b>triangles)</b> of turbulent flow on both surfaces of the wing upstream of the natural transition point, and B) that a channel or bump on the upper surface would trip turbulent flow across the whole upper surface upstream of the natural transition point. A potentially more important consideration than the skin friction drag increment is the change in overall airfoil performance due to the installation of instrumentation along most of the wingspan. To quantify this effect, 2 D CFD simulations of the flow over a representative mid-span airfoil section were conducted in order to assess the change in lift and drag curves for the airfoil in the presence of disturbed flow due to the installed instrumentation. A discussion as to the impact on high-altitude and low-speed operation of this and similar aircraft is provided...|$|R

30|$|Teleseismic body wave {{inversion}} is {{a sensitive}} method {{for determining the}} depth of a slip area using the depth phases (i.e., the -pP and -sP phases). Ammon-III assumed three planar fault segments to express the very long and wide rupture area of the 2004 Sumatra earthquake; however, the subducting slab geometry obtained by seismicity is actually curved (Engdahl et al. [2007]; Sibuet et al. [2007]). The gap in depth between the assumed fault model and the true slab geometry causes a negative effect in the inversion results. It is important for teleseismic body wave inversion to use accurate fault geometry, particularly dip directions. Here we used the fault geometry model of Hoechner et al. ([2008]), which was constructed by an accurate discretization of subducting slab geometry. This fault geometry model consists of 12 × 36 = 432 subfaults with depths ranging from 5 to 53 km, based on regionalized upper mantle (RUM) slab geometry (Gudmundsson and Sambridge [1998]). The average subfault length and width are 40 and 16 km, respectively. The detailed subfault parameters are cited in supplementary data set S 3 of Hoechner et al. ([2008]). A single-point source is used as the subfault Green’s function (i.e., rupture propagation inside each subfault is not included).

H 577 P COMP 2015 Zhangxviii, 118 pages :color illustrationsVehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET) have {{attracted}} increasing attentions from both research and industry communities. By equipping vehicles with on-board wireless communication facilities, the vehicular networking technology provides {{a variety of}} novel and exciting applications to vehicular users to enhance their road safety and travel comfort, and increase experiences of their on-road life. In the development of vehicular applications and services, we witness the trend of complementary vehicular networks and the Internet. To support high quality applications and services, well-planned network infrastructure and vehicle-oriented application should be jointly considered in designing vehicular Internet access networks. To {{improve the quality of}} vehicular Internet access from the above two perspectives,we use Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of user Experience (QoE) respectively as the measures. Quality of service is a performance indicator for vehicular access networks and characterizes the attributes associated with the networks and their protocols. On the other hand, quality of user experience is a performance metric defined from the end-user's point of view and represents the perceived quality of applications and services. Although with a bright future,the way to ubiquitous and efficient vehicular Internet access still faces with numerous research and engineering challenges. Due to the wireless spectrum crisis in licensed wireless communication channels,the existing well-planned cel-lular networks are not adequate to satisfy the increasing data demand from vehicular appli-cations. It is a challenging issue to efficiently exploit Wi-Fi or other wireless communication technologies to establish or supplement city-wide or nation-wide road-side vehicular Internet access networks. Secondly, to be resilient to performance degradation caused by highly dynamic topology of vehicular networks, packet routing and data dissemination protocols should be adaptive to network partition and link disconnection. Last but not the least, quality of conventional Internet applications and services suffer greatly from the vehicle mobility and intermittent Internet access. To improve the user experience, application-level service enhancement should be considered in designing vehicular applications and services. In this research, we systematically analyze the above problems and propose effective and efficient solutions to address the afore-mentioned challenges. Our goal is to build a framework to facilitate the multi-user Internet access in wireless vehicular networks with QoS guaranteed network infrastructure and protocols, and QoE enhanced applications and services. Our contribution are summarized as follows. To address the issue of infrastructure planning, we identify the problem how to deploy different types of network components,such as base stations and relays, in a cost-efficient way to maximize the network performance. First,we propose a detailed analytical model for infrastructure-based vehicular Internet access in the presence of different network compo-nents. Then, through extensive simulations based on the proposed model, we obtain some guidelines on choosing and deploying different network components in vehicular Internet access networks. Finally, as a special case study of infrastructure planning, we investigate the incremental and cost-efficient network planning (ICNP) problem in vehicular Internet access networks with the objective of improving network capacity for an existing network under limited deployment cost. After defining a cost efficiency metric,namely incremental upgrade utility (IUU), we develop a heuristic algorithm, called Greedy Link Deployment algorithm (GLiD) with approximation ratio (1 - 1 /√e) for deploying additional wireless links to the existing networks to achieve the maximum performance improvement. To address the issue of protocol adaption,we investigate the maximum network connectivity problem in vehicular Internet access networks, in which vehicles adopt both vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle communications. We first analyze the characteristics of network connectivity in vehicular Internet access networks and derive a closed form to represent the connectivity probability under specific road-side units (RSU) deployment model and vehicle arrival rate. Then, we develop a connectivity-oriented data dissemina-tion (CoDA) protocol to maximize the minimum network connectivity in vehicular Internet access systems based on the probabilistic analysis. Finally, we validate the CoDA protocol through extensive simulations and the results show that the CoDA protocol can achieve the maximum connectivity probability in vehicular communications in different network scenarios. To address the issue of service enhancement,we take localization service, a fundamental service in vehicular applications, as an example. We study the vehicular localization problem in urban environments. It is a challenging task to achieve high localization accuracy due to the severe multi-path effects caused by buildings and interfering sources in urban area. First, we perform a series of experiments which shows that the vehicular mobility and multi-path effect impose severe degradation in localization performance of GPS receivers. We then identify the correlation between the similarity of signal-noise ratio (SNR) values of GPS signals from different GPS satellites and relative distance among those GPS receivers. Based on the observation, we design the Networking-GPS algorithm, which constructs atomic redundantly rigid graphs according to the signal similarity and <b>expands</b> atomic <b>triangles</b> to reach anchor points along the road side. Therefore, the local accuracy can be transited to the global accuracy through the redundantly rigid transformation. Our evaluation based on real GPS traces shows that Networking-GPS can achieve higher accuracy against multi-path effect in urban area. Department of ComputingPh.
