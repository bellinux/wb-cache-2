5|$|Beetle {{antennae}} {{are primarily}} organs of sensory perception and can detect motion, odour and chemical substances, {{but may also}} be used to physically feel a beetle's environment. Beetle families may use antennae in different ways. For example, when moving quickly, tiger beetles {{may not be able to}} see very well and instead hold their antennae rigidly in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Fin skeletons are {{elongated}} {{and supported}} with soft and unsegmented rays named ceratotrichia, filaments of elastic protein resembling the horny keratin in hair and feathers. Most sharks have eight fins. Sharks can only drift away from objects directly in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> because their fins {{do not allow}} them to move in the tail-first direction.|$|E
5|$|A polar bear—the {{guardian}} of the ice wand—raises the ice wand from beneath the ocean. The fairies add an ice wand to each planet of the Solar System. Along with the white wand at Fairy World, the ice wands create a celestial smile that projects its light into The Darkness. The smile transforms it into a bright sun, The Kindness, and Timmy concludes The Darkness was only looking for a friend. The group returns to Dimmsdale, where an Eliminator, dubbed a 'Hug'inator by Cosmo, crashes in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and spews out everyone who had been sucked in. Everyone parties in Fairy World and celebrates the chosen one's accomplishment.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} numerous {{death threats}} in the mail, Bart becomes paranoid. It is {{revealed that the}} writer is his enemy, Sideshow Bob, who is incarcerated in Springfield State Prison. The next day, Sideshow Bob's parole hearing is held; the parole board is easily convinced that Sideshow Bob {{is no longer a}} threat. When the Simpson family goes to the cinema, Sideshow Bob sits in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and acts obnoxiously. The Simpsons then realize that it was he who sent the letters, and Marge angrily tells him to stay away from Bart.|$|E
5|$|Harold's forces {{deployed}} in a small, dense formation {{at the top}} of steep slope, with their flanks protected by woods and marshy ground in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> The line may have extended far enough to be anchored on a nearby stream. The English formed a shield wall, with the front ranks holding their shields close together or even overlapping to provide protection from attack. Sources differ on the exact site that the English fought on: some sources state the site of the abbey, but some newer sources suggest it was Caldbec Hill.|$|E
5|$|In late 1164 Roger led a {{deputation}} from Henry II that {{visited the}} papal court, or curia, {{to try to}} persuade Alexander III that any decision on the deposition of Becket should take place in England under a papal legate, rather than in Rome. While Becket was in exile, Roger also managed to secure papal permission for archbishops of York to carry their cross in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> anywhere in England, a right that had long been a bone of contention between Canterbury and York. Later, the pope rescinded the permission, but consistently refused to give primacy to either Canterbury or York in their struggles.|$|E

5|$|In the Telmarine castle, {{the lords}} {{of the council}} learn that Prince Caspian is gone, and Miraz says that Narnians {{abducted}} him. Everyone laughs, saying that Narnians are not real, after which the captured Trumpkin is presented in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as evidence. Miraz persuades the council to attack the Narnians and retrieve Caspian, while secretly plotting to kill him instead. Lord Sopespian suspects Miraz's motives, and discusses his treasonous thoughts with his ally, General Glozelle.|$|E
5|$|Inspector Altieri {{arrives at}} the house and Neal kills her. Giermani and Anne arrive soon afterwards; when Neal sees that he cannot escape, he slits his throat in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Finding the {{telephone}} out of order, Giermani and Anne go outside to report the incident from the car radio. Giermani returns {{to the house and}} is murdered by Neal, who had faked his own death. Neal waits inside for Anne to return, but when she opens the door, she accidentally knocks over a metal sculpture that impales and kills Neal. The horror-stricken Anne stands in the rain and screams repeatedly.|$|E
5|$|Situational {{awareness}} {{was also}} reduced because the pilots {{did not have}} a chart in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> at all times. The crew was not aware that they could check the aircraft location in relation to the centerline with a VDF. The crew probably put too much emphasis on the indications displayed by the GPS. The aircraft descended into mountainous terrain without control over the lateral navigation. Despite uncertainty and disagreement in the group, the approach was not abandoned, as the aircraft should have climbed to a safe altitude while the problem was solved.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor and Clara find a {{location}} in the mansion which is noticeably colder {{than the rest of}} the house, and they feel as if they are being watched. Suddenly the house grows cold and Clara feels something holding her hand when there's nothing there. The two race back to where the Professor and Emma are waiting to see Palmer's equipment activating of its own accord. A thin black disc materializes in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and Emma senses something crying out for help as the ghost appears in a dark hallway crying for help. The Doctor quickly takes pictures of them before the disc vanishes and the house returns to normal.|$|E
5|$|The {{survivors}} at the shingle, many facing combat for {{the first}} time, found themselves relatively well-protected from small arms fire, but still exposed to artillery and mortars. In <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> lay heavily mined flats exposed to active fire from the bluffs above. Morale naturally became a problem. Many groups were leaderless and witnesses {{to the fate of}} neighboring troops and landings coming in around them. Wounded men on the beach were drowning in the incoming tide and incoming landing craft were being pounded and set ablaze.|$|E
5|$|Devil Daggers is {{a shooter}} video game with {{gameplay}} experienced from a first-person perspective. The {{goal of the}} game is to kill demonic enemies and survive for as long as possible. Devil Daggers opens with the player character standing in a shadowy room; in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> is a floating dagger illuminated by a spotlight. Upon retrieving the dagger, the player is transported to a flat, floating platform arena cloaked in darkness. In the arena, demonic enemies begin spawning. Initially, a series of tentacled, towering creatures spawn and start releasing swarms of flying skulls that pursue the player. As time progresses, more exotic creatures that pose a greater threat and exhibit different behaviour begin to appear. Each enemy makes a unique and continuous noise, so that the player is able to recognise what type of enemy is approaching them.|$|E

As the scene draws attention and police arrive, a puppet informs the men that they can kill each other or let Dina die. They initially fight each other, during which Brad is cut, but ultimately choose to allow Dina to die instead.|$|R
25|$|For the zoo deployment, {{a greatly}} {{simplified}} operating system was needed. Since the schedules were relatively slow, {{on the order}} of 10 minutes between trains, the automated system was not needed. The cars were modified to place a small operator cabin at the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> entered through a separate door. Trains normally operated in four-car units, with the cabins facing front and rear. The rear-facing cabin was used while backing up the trains. The operator also doubled as the tour guide.|$|R
5|$|If one interprets each 1-cell in Rule 184 as {{containing}} a particle, these particles behave {{in many ways}} similarly to automobiles in a single lane of traffic: they move forward at a constant speed if there is open space in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> and otherwise they stop. Traffic models such as Rule 184 and its generalizations that discretize both space and time are commonly called particle-hopping models. Although very primitive, the Rule 184 model of traffic flow already predicts some of the familiar emergent features of real traffic: clusters of freely moving cars separated by stretches of open road when traffic is light, and waves of stop-and-go traffic when it is heavy.|$|E
5|$|In Rotterdam, though {{reinforced}} by an infantry regiment, the Dutch failed to completely dislodge the German airborne troops from their bridgehead {{on the northern}} bank of the Maas. Despite permission from General Kurt Student, the German commander in Rotterdam refused to evacuate this bridgehead and the few German defenders held fast in a single office building, protected by a canal in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and covered by fire from the south bank. The two remaining Dutch bombers failed to destroy the Willemsbrug. The German forces involved in the attack of the previous day on The Hague also held out, none of the attempts to eliminate the isolated groups of in total about 1600 paratroopers and airlanded forces met with success.|$|E
5|$|Longstreet's {{attack was}} delayed, however, because he {{first had to}} wait for his final brigade (Evander M. Law's, Hood's division) to arrive, and then he was forced to march on a long, {{circuitous}} route that could not be seen by Union Army Signal Corps observers on Little Round Top. It was 4 p.m. by the time his two divisions reached their jumping off points, and then he and his generals were astonished to find the III Corps planted directly in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> on the Emmitsburg Road. Hood argued with Longstreet that this new situation demanded a change in tactics; he wanted to swing around, below and behind, Round Top and hit the Union Army in the rear. Longstreet, however, refused to consider such a modification to Lee's order.|$|E

5|$|Much of the Cetacean Institute, Taylor's workplace, {{was created}} by using the real-life Monterey Bay Aquarium. A holding tank for the whales was added via special effects to the Aquarium's exterior. For close-ups of the {{characters}} as they watched the whales in the tank, the Aquarium's walls and railings were measured and replicated for a set on the Paramount parking lot. One scene takes place by a large glass through which observers view the whales—and Spock's initiation of a mind meld—underwater. Footage of the actors shot in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as they reacted to a brick wall in the Aquarium was combined with shots taken from their rear as they {{stood in front of}} a large blue screen at ILM to produce this scene. The footage of Spock's melding with the whales was shot weeks later in a large water tank used to train astronauts for weightlessness.|$|E
5|$|Players can use {{a variety}} of weapons to fight enemies. The game {{features}} a large arsenal of weapons, from two-handed pistols to rocket launchers, and a variety of sea, land and air vehicles. Players can drive them, jump on top of them or hide in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> while they are moving and hijack enemy vehicles, triggering a series of quick-time events. Initially, the player must acquire weapons and vehicles in the field. Early in the game, they encounter a black market supplier from whom weapons and vehicles can be purchased (with optional delivery to the player's location by helicopter). As more chaos points are gained, additional weapons, vehicles and an extraction option become available on the black market. All black-market weapons and vehicles can be upgraded in steps with weapon and vehicle components in the game world; over 2,000 parts may be acquired. Players use a beacon to access the market.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{criticized the}} AI, which some found inconsistent. Whitehead criticized his {{experience}} of enemies that can see Corvo {{from a great}} distance yet sometimes remain unaware of him while in his enemies' peripheral vision. Juba criticized the inconsistent detection by enemies that lead to unpredictable and unreliable stealth mechanics that could force stealth-focused players into a combat situation, for which their character is not built. According to G4's Jake Gaskill, the AI worked well in combat, with enemies employing different tactics and effectively countering attacks, but when not alerted, enemies would ignore actions directly in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Watters also mentioned lulls in enemy intelligence, but he said that it remained tenacious enough to keep the enemies formidable.|$|E
60|$|He {{recognized}} {{it with a}} little start. It had once been a mission hall, then a furniture shop, and later on had been empty for years. It was brilliantly lit up, and he pressed forward and peered through the window. Inside the place was packed. Brooks and a dozen or so others were sitting on a sort of slightly-raised platform {{at the end of the}} room, with a desk in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Lord Arranmore pulled his hat over his eyes and forced his way just inside. Almost as he entered Brooks rose to his feet.|$|R
60|$|I {{think it}} was in the {{neighborhood}} of Barber-Surgeons' Hall, which stands amid an intricacy of old streets, where I should never have thought of going, that I saw a row of ancient almshouses, of Elizabethan structure. They looked wofully dilapidated. In <b>front</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> was an inscription, setting forth that some worthy alderman had founded this establishment for the support of six poor men; and these six, or their successors, are still supported, but no larger number, although the value of the property left for that purpose would now suffice for a much larger number.|$|R
