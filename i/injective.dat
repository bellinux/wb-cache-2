5|$|The {{fact that}} every {{configuration}} has a predecessor may be summarized {{by saying that}} Rule 90 is surjective. The function that maps each configuration to its successor is, mathematically, a surjective function. Rule 90 is also not <b>injective.</b> In an <b>injective</b> rule, every two different configurations have different successors, but Rule 90 has pairs of configurations with the same successor. Rule 90 {{provides an example of}} a cellular automaton that is surjective but not <b>injective.</b> The Garden of Eden theorem of Moore and Myhill implies that every <b>injective</b> cellular automaton must be surjective, but this example shows that the converse is not true.|$|E

5|$|Culik {{begins with}} the {{observation}} that a cellular automaton has an <b>injective</b> transition function {{if and only if}} the transition function is <b>injective</b> on the subsets of configurations that are periodic (repeating the same substring infinitely often in both directions). He defines a nondeterministic finite-state transducer that performs the transition rule of the automaton on periodic strings. This transducer works by remembering the neighborhood of the automaton {{at the start of the}} string and entering an accepting state when that neighborhood concatenated to the end of the input would cause its nondeterministically chosen transitions to be correct. Culik then swaps the input and output of the transducer. The transducer resulting from this swap simulates the inverse dynamics of the given automaton. Finally, Culik applies previously known algorithms to test whether the resulting swapped transducer maps each input to a single output.|$|E

5|$|Every {{configuration}} of Rule 90 has exactly four predecessors, other configurations {{that form the}} given configuration after a single step. Therefore, in contrast to many other cellular automata such as Conway's Game of Life, Rule 90 has no Garden of Eden, a configuration with no predecessors. It {{provides an example of}} a cellular automaton that is surjective (each configuration has a predecessor) but not <b>injective</b> (it has sets of more than one configuration with the same successor), showing that the converse of the Garden of Eden theorem is not true.|$|E

25|$|<b>Injective</b> modules {{have been}} heavily studied, {{and a variety}} of {{additional}} notions are defined in terms of them: <b>Injective</b> cogenerators are <b>injective</b> modules that faithfully represent the entire category of modules. <b>Injective</b> resolutions measure how far from <b>injective</b> a module is in terms of the <b>injective</b> dimension and represent modules in the derived category. <b>Injective</b> hulls are maximal essential extensions, and turn out to be minimal <b>injective</b> extensions. Over a Noetherian ring, every <b>injective</b> module is uniquely a direct sum of indecomposable modules, and their structure is well understood. An <b>injective</b> module over one ring, may not be <b>injective</b> over another, but there are well-understood methods of changing rings which handle special cases. Rings which are themselves <b>injective</b> modules have a number of interesting properties and include rings such as group rings of finite groups over fields. <b>Injective</b> modules include divisible groups and are generalized by the notion of <b>injective</b> objects in category theory.|$|E

Slightly more generally: if (X, OX) is a ringed space, then {{the category of}} all sheaves of OX-modules is an abelian category with enough <b>injectives,</b> and we can again construct sheaf cohomology as the right derived functors of the global section functor.|$|R

25|$|For {{quotient}} rings R/I, {{the change}} of rings is also very clear. An R-module is an R/I-module precisely when it is annihilated by I. The submodule annI(M) = { m in M : im = 0 for all i in I } is a left submodule of the left R-module M, and is the largest submodule of M that is an R/I-module. If M is an <b>injective</b> left R-module, then annI(M) is an <b>injective</b> left R/I-module. Applying this to R=Z, I=nZ and M=Q/Z, one gets the familiar fact that Z/nZ is <b>injective</b> as a module over itself. While {{it is easy to}} convert <b>injective</b> R-modules into <b>injective</b> R/I-modules, this process does not convert <b>injective</b> R-resolutions into <b>injective</b> R/I-resolutions, and the homology of the resulting complex is one of the early and fundamental areas of study of relative homological algebra.|$|E
25|$|Using this criterion, one {{can show}} that Q is an <b>injective</b> abelian group (i.e. an <b>injective</b> module over Z). More {{generally}}, an abelian group is <b>injective</b> {{if and only if}} it is divisible. More generally still: a module over a principal ideal domain is <b>injective</b> if and only if it is divisible (the case of vector spaces is an example of this theorem, as every field is a principal ideal domain and every vector space is divisible). Over a general integral domain, we still have one implication: every <b>injective</b> module over an integral domain is divisible.|$|E
