5|$|Further {{improvements}} {{were introduced}} throughout the Merlin range: 1943 saw {{the introduction of}} a Bendix-Stromberg pressure carburettor that injected fuel at 5 pounds per square inch (34kPa; 0.34 bar) through a nozzle directly into the supercharger, and was <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> Merlin 66, 70, 76, 77 and 85 variants. The final development, which was <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> the 100-series Merlins, was an S.U. injection carburettor that injected fuel into the supercharger using a fuel pump driven as a function of crankshaft speed and engine pressures.|$|E

40|$|Orientation: The {{influence}} of the fit components of job embeddedness (<b>fit</b> <b>to</b> job, <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> organization and <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> community) on job performance has not been extensively researched and the relationship is largely unknown. Research purpose: This study investigated the {{influence of}} the fit components of job embeddedness (employee <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> job, <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> organization and <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> community) on employees’ job performance. Motivation for the study: There is a dearth of studies on the fit components of job embeddedness and the relationship with job performance in developing countries especially in Southern Africa. Research design, approach and method: This cross-sectional study made use of a quantitative survey design. The target population comprised employees working in Zimbabwe’s manufacturing sector (n = 452). Main findings: The results revealed that employee <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> job, <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> organization and <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> community positively influences employees’ job performance. Practical/managerial implications: The findings have implications for human resource managers in Zimbabwe’s manufacturing sector, who are encouraged to consider the three fit factors of job embeddedness during the job applicants interviewing process as they have a significant potential to influence job performance. Contribution/value-addition: The research is one of the primary research papers to investigate the direct effects of the fit components of job embeddedness on employee job performance within the Zimbabwean context. It provides a rich platform for further studies and replication in other industry sectors especially within the African context...|$|R

5|$|A call to {{increase}} the battery life of ULBs was once again made after the unsuccessful initial search in 2009 for the flight recorders on Air France Flight 447, which were not located until 2011. A formal recommendation that the ULB design be upgraded to offer a longer battery life or to make the recorders ejectable had {{been included in the}} final report of the board of inquiry into the loss of South African Airways Flight 295 over the Indian Ocean in 1987; however, the ICAO did not make such a recommendation until 2014, with implementation by 2018. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued new regulations requiring that the transmitting time of ULBs <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> aircraft flight recorders be increased from 30 to 90 days. The agency proposed a new underwater locator beacon with a greater transmitting range to be <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> aircraft flying over oceans. In June 2015, Dukane, a manufacturer of underwater locator beacons, began selling beacons with a 90-day battery life.|$|E
