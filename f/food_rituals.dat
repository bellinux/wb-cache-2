40|$|ABSTRACT Eating and its {{associated}} activities are embodied, social practices that are meaningful and meaning-making. In order to explore the emotional geographies of eating practices, this article draws on a qualitative study of the everyday <b>food</b> <b>rituals</b> of female farm workers of colour in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Drawing on interview transcripts analysed using a social constructionist approach, three themes are elaborated, concerned with knowing, agency and community in relation to which the transformative potential of women's participation in food practices {{in the space of}} the kitchen is explored. In the ritual of preparing food, knowing is demonstrated as embodied activity with possibilities of corporeal transformation. As an embodied way of knowing, food-making also enhances women's sense of agency. Furthermore, eating rituals do not simply endorse a celebration of community, but call for a re-appreciation of women's positions and their power to shape relations and spaces of resistance...|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{concepts}} are static while rituals are manifestations of motion. Cultural facts {{can usually be}} presented as a declarative sentence or an assertion. They do not contain imperative actions. One example is the Ao Yao’s concept that illness {{is caused by the}} gods and ghosts who take the patients’ spirits to blackmail them for <b>food.</b> <b>Rituals</b> are procedural human behaviors. Any ritual has a clearly prescribed process of actions. For example, the Ao Yao’s treatment ritual can be formulated as “cook a meal and pour wine, touch the infected part of the patient, chant to send agents to negotiate with the gods, then offer the oblations to the gods’ place and take the patient’s spirits back.” People who participate in the ritual undertake such processes with bodily and oral actions. That is the ritual’s “actability.” Visibility and actability make the ritual effective for participants to learn and repeat it. Newcomers can acquire the ritual from the veterans through procedures. Thus rituals are passed on within the ethnic group and over generations, carrying the concepts with them.|$|E
40|$|The essay {{critically}} {{discusses the}} predominant {{role played by}} water {{in the lives of}} people from Vedic times to the present day, in the Hindu world. A number of ceremonies both happy or auspicious-making and secular have been associated with water. Several hymns of the Vedas, Brāhmanas, Mahābhārata, Āgamic and Purānic texts are drawn upon to bring out the legends and myths, and genuine beliefs, connected with water that underscore the sacred and profane, purificatory, healing and resuscitating dimensions of water. The essay treats readers to many ancient motifs concerning the pervasive value and utility of water. These comprise, variously, sacrifice, fertility rites, water-medium birth, divine metamorphosis, self-conceiving cosmic birth, totemism life-cycle rites, sanctifications, consecration and installation of icons and edifices, <b>food</b> <b>rituals,</b> monsoon rites, to pacifications, possession and exorcism, death, after-life and rebirth rituals. Reference is also made to the ecology of water resources, the economy of water scarcity, ‘war-wars’ or water imperialism, and water justice in the socio-political arenas of post independent India, in a rapidly liberalising and globalising world. In that regard practical applications of the knowledge-base are explored through the work of NGOs and Water Swamis in the subcontinent...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a process of}} {{negotiating}} identity among Polish migrants {{will be discussed in}} relation to their food habits: consumption, preparation and celebration. Through the ethnographic examination of <b>food</b> <b>rituals</b> the construction of meaning of home as both space and nationality will be observed and the attitude to the host culture will be revealed in the quotidian activities. The qualitative research based on interviews and visual ethnography has shown that there are three dominant ways of exchange with the local culture ranging from the least present to the ostentatiously conspicuous, named here as: orthodox, porous, and alternate. Each of them, however, is characterised by a perplexing degree of fluidity and sometimes contradiction which opposes the objectification of the models of culture, as had been already noticed by Bhabha (2007 [1994]) in relation to diasporic cultures and their tactics of adaptation. Home among Polish immigrants to the UK is a changing concept, open to negotiation, depending on their current personal situation, profession, gender, expectations, ambitions and even peer pressure. Yet (re) creating home requires a certain dose of familiarity conceived from the meaning of Polishness which needs to be materialised from past memories on a daily basis. This research shows that such process oscillates between acceptance and rejection recognisable in the acts of mundane rituals, gaining their significance from the emotional engagement of the participants. ?? 2010 Taylor & Francis...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE - Although Asians {{demonstrate}} {{elevated levels}} of type 2 diabetes, {{little attention has been}} directed to their unique cultural beliefs and practices regarding diabetes. We describe cultural and family challenges to illness management in foreign-born Chinese American patients with type 2 diabetes and their spouses. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - This was an interpretive comparative interview study with 20 foreign-born Chinese American couples (n = 40) living with type 2 diabetes. Multiple (six to seven) semistructured interviews with each couple in individual, group, and couple settings elicited beliefs about diabetes and narratives of care within the family and community. Interpretive narrative and thematic analysis were completed. A separate respondent group of 19 patients and spouses who met the inclusion criteria reviewed and confirmed the themes developed from the initial couples. RESULTS - Cultural and family challenges to diabetes management within foreign-born Chinese American families included how 1) diabetes symptoms challenged family harmony, 2) dietary prescriptions challenged food beliefs and practices, and 3) disease management requirements challenged established family role responsibilities. CONCLUSIONS - Culturally nuanced care with immigrant Chinese Americans requires attentiveness to the social context of disease management. Patients' and families' disease management decisions are seldom made independent of their concerns for family well-being, family face, and the reciprocal responsibilities required by varied family roles.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{practices of}} food refusal among young, educated southern Italian women {{coming of age}} in “traditional” social contexts in the region of Calabria, southern Italy. By combining feminist theory and anthropological analysis, I provide an alternative approach to the study of “eating disorders,” disrupting prevailing psychological frameworks that pathologize women 2 ̆ 7 s experiences of food refusal. Moving away from biomedical understandings of “eating disorders,” the findings are grounded in women 2 ̆ 7 s narratives of suffering, illustrating that practices of food refusal are deployed by women to negotiate and contest gender and kin roles and ideologies. Focusing on how southern Italian women 2 ̆ 7 s social identities are constructed and negotiated through kinship and gender relations, this dissertation illuminates the ways in which daily <b>food</b> <b>rituals</b> act as a source of authority, prestige, and power for southern Italian women. ^ Framed around the voices of women who engaged in practices of food refusal, the dissertation analyzes how disengagement from exchange networks that strengthen social identities and relationships enables a woman to change gender norms. Thus, food refusal becomes a conduit through which women can subtly disengage from being a “good” daughter, sister, niece, granddaughter, aunt, and/or fiancée, and contest social relations that inevitably operate to legitimize social identities that they reject. By focusing on the social reality where the mundane—the minutiae of daily life —are played out and where relations of power are enacted, it is possible to conceptualize food refusal as a practice through which young women vie for power and authority in their everyday lives. Ultimately, this research advocates for a rethinking of the categories “anorexia,” “bulimia” and other related “eating disorders” and towards a demedicalized understanding of women 2 ̆ 7 s practices of food refusal. ...|$|E

Merging healthful eating with medicines in our foods is part of the promise of biotechnology and food-based products that may have medicinal capacity. Biotechnology and agriculture also offer new ways to make vaccines, more cheaply, more effectively, and with greater capacity, actually growing medicines, or “pharming. ” Agriculture and health have always been linked, and a new relationship is evolving requiring interdisciplinary approaches and new thinking. There is also the need to share responsibility for safety and for the accountability of the progresses. Promises regarding agricultural biotechnology must be realistic and objective and must be evaluated with an eye to political and moral and must be kept throughout the whole chain from producers to consumers. How do we assure that the public understands what the risks and benefits? We cannot assure them until we ourselves understand the risks to human health, especially that of our children, and to the environment.

40|$|The {{exhibition}} {{explores the}} humour and quirkiness present within current design/craft {{practice in the}} UK. Simultaneously, the show significantly addresses cultural differences and the inter-cultural importance of food and ceramic kitchenware articles, locating British design aesthetic in a contemporary worldwide framework. The lemon squeezers began as a one-off piece and shifted quickly from studio production into factory manufacture, endorsed by coverage {{in the press and}} retail sales (e. g. The Conran Shop, Heal’s and Liberty’s, as well as Japan, Singapore and the USA.) The design of the lemon squeezers were the result of investigations into domestic objects and how a design for a functional object could be conceived as a theatrical piece as well as functioning as a kitchen utensil, which the Philippe Starck Juicy Salif juicer (1988) exemplifies. The object no longer needs to be hidden away when not in use but can be utilised as a display piece produced in various colours and decorative possibilities. The exhibits represent makers who produce gallery pieces and are a mixture of traditional craft-makers or potters, whilst other work is representative of designers who produce ware in a studio batch production environment. Other contributors work with industry and high-volume production runs. The lemon squeezers were developed during a 6 week study trip to Lisbon in association with the Royal College of Art and ARCO – the Centre de Arte e Communicacao Visual in Lisbon. The design was developed from studies of Manueline Architecture from the Monastery of the Heronymites and studies at Belem Tower and the Museu de Marinha in Belem.

This research explored the capacity of whanau (family, extended family) to overcome adversity, flourish and enjoy better health and well-being. While external factors, internal dynamics, and financial pressures often constrain capacity, whanau have nevertheless demonstrated an innate {{ability to respond to}} these challenges – to make use of limited resources, and to react in positive and innovative ways. Three key objectives were identified to help seek and understand Maori notions of whanau resilience and how they are utilised by whanau for positive growth and development. The three objectives were: 1. To identify resilience mechanisms which exist within whanau; 2. To consider the cultural underpinnings of resilience; and 3. To construct an evidenced based framework for resilient whanau. A thematic analysis detailed the components of a Whanau Resilience Framework. The framework consists of four resilience platforms: (1) Whanaungatanga (networks and relationships); (2) Pukenga (skills and abilities); (3) Tikanga (values and beliefs); and (4) Tuakiri-a-Maori (cultural identity). This thesis highlights both the synergies and dissonance between Maori and non-Maori perspectives of resilience and how cultural factors might best guide Maori and whanau development. Insofar as this framework exhibits similar resilence strategies to other populations, it is at the micro-level where there are differences between Maori and other cultures or populations...|$|E
40|$|Kosher food is not {{necessarily}} the same as 'Jewish' food. The thesis explores ideas of Jewish identity in Britain in relation to food, examining the period from the end of austerity in the mid- 1950 s until the beginning of the twenty-first century. The period starts with Britain's emergence from the strictures of rationing and the development of an era of abundance and choice that has led, {{at the beginning of the}} twenty-first century, to a complex and ambivalent relationship between food and society. The thesis explores food in relation to the histories of diverse British Jewish communities and individuals deploying a range of evidence including oral histories, memoirs, journalism and cookery books. It studies the practice of Jewish identity and food, looking at Jewish communities ranging from the strictly Orthodox to progressive Jews. Theories of place, displacement and circuitry in the context of a global food economy are central to the thesis as are ideas of memory, myth and ritual. The first two chapters study the religious, political and social context of kosher food practice in Britain, analysing relations between the ecclesiastical authorities, the kosher food industry and consumers in which issues of class and gender are pivotal. Non-Jewish responses to kosher food are also examined. The third chapter interrogates the culinary origins of Ashkenazi and Sephardi food in Britain in the context of the globalization of the food industry, questioning how this affects the 'Jewishness' of specific culinary practices. The final chapter investigates the meaning and development of Jewish <b>food</b> <b>rituals</b> with respect to Sabbath and festival observance. The thesis suggests that despite the particularity of Jewish practice in relation to food, and the specific circumstances of the Diaspora, the Jewish practice of identity through food should not be treated as exceptional. The concept of 'Jewish' food is as problematic and as valid as the identification of any other group with a specific cuisine. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the construction of}} identity in the pseudepigraphic novel Joseph and Aseneth by means of discussions of conversion, <b>food</b> <b>ritual,</b> and genre. Each of these is invaluable for interpreting the meaning and significance of the honeycomb scene in which Aseneth is transformed. The interaction of a ritual of eating, angelic visits, and the medium of genre for expressing transformation presents a window through which to view identity in the ancient world. This project explores how the shared symbolic knowledge {{of the ancient world}} informs the literary presentation of Aseneth's transformation that describes the development of her religious identity.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} how some older Jewish women create meaning and value in their lives through daily individual and group practices involving food, memory, and sociality. Presiding over the operations of Temple Emmanuel in Chelsea, Massachusetts, a small, blue-collar city of about 35, 000 people just north of Boston, these women are important caretakers of Chelsea's once vibrant Jewish community. They are mavens, "experts," the community's respected, female guardians of "Yiddishkeit," and links to "authentic" (but often contested) cultures from romanticized pasts. Like many older women around the world, Jewish women in Chelsea employ sensual and social memories through <b>food</b> <b>rituals</b> to construct and maintain these powerful roles as beloved and maligned "cultural" caretakers and community leaders. My research illuminates {{the other side of}} the Jewish American "success" story of upward economic and social mobility; I ask, what about the people who have "stayed" in places like Chelsea, intimately connected to these once strongholds of "Yiddishkeit" through conscious choice and/or lack of economic and social resources, people who are, at the same time, part of and peripheral to the Jewish "success" narrative?I argue that for this secular community, Jewish cultural identity is both strong and unstable. Life-long tenuous, contradictory connections to Judaism as a religion and culture, embodied in women's daily practices involving food, socializing, remembering, and Temple involvement, construct women's "lifeworlds," Jewish cultural identities that buffer them from emotional pain associated with losses due to aging and social change. While identifying as Jewish is viewed as a positive, inalienable trait and a source of value for all the women in this study, everyday practices, supported by memories embedded in social rituals and recalled in stories and food, paint a more complex portrait of revered, destabilized, and often contentious individual and communal Jewish identities. I borrow the term "lifeworlds" from Michael Jackson (1996). Jackson's argument "prioritizing (of) lived experience over theoretical knowledge" and paying attention to what beliefs are "made to mean, and what they accomplish for those who invoke and use them" (1996 : 6), is particularly fitting here for a number of reasons, including how the materiality and emotionally evocative powers of food are best explored, I believe, through a phenomenological lens. Also, this group's marginalized status in both their immediate community and the larger Greater Boston Jewish community challenges assumptions about cultural homogeneity, making Jackson's interpretations of "lifeworld" particularly appealing.

40|$|Some Black {{women writers}} [...] Zora Neale Hurston, Toni Cade Bambara, Paule Marshall, Gloria Naylor, and Alice Walker [...] of American fiction have written {{characterizations}} of winning women. Their characterizations include {{women who are}} capable of taking risks, making choices, and taking responsiblity for their choices. These winning women are capable of accepting their own successes and failures by the conclusions of the novels. They are characterized as dealing with devastating and traumatic personal histories in a growth-enhancing manner. Characterizations of winning women by these authors are consistently revealed through five developmental stages: conditioning, awareness, interiorizing, reintegrating, and winning. These stages contain patterns that are consistent from author to author. While conditioning and awareness of the negative influcences of conditioning are predictable, this study introduces the concept of interiorizing and reintegrating as positive steps toward becoming a winning woman. Frequent descriptions of numbness and disorientation mark the most obvious stages of interiorizing. It is not until the Twentieth Century that we see women writers using this interiorizing process as a necessary step toward growth. Surviving interiorizing, as these winning women do, leads to the essential stage of reintegrating. Interiorizing is a complete separation from social interaction; reintegrating is a gradual reattachment to social process. First, elaborate descriptions of bathing rituals affirm the importance of a woman's body to herself. Second, reintegrating involves <b>food</b> <b>rituals</b> which signal social reconnection. Celebration banquets and family recipes offer an important reminder to the winning woman that the future is built on the past. Taking the best of what has been learned from the past into the future provides strength and stability. The characterization of a winning woman stops with potential rather than completion. A winning woman must still take risks, make choices, and bear the consequences of her choices. The winning woman does not accept a diminished life of harmful conformity. She is characterized as discovering how to use choice and power. Novels included in this study are: Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Are Watching God; Toni Cade Bambara's The Salt Eaters; Paule Marshall's Brownstone, Brown Girl; The Chosen Place, the Timeless People; and Praisesong for the Widow; Gloria Naylor's The Women of Brewster Place, Linden Hills; and Alice Walker's Meridian, and The Color Purple.

40|$|This thesis {{will make}} an {{original}} contribution to the literature on cross-cultural domestic space. It also has ethnographic potential {{for the analysis of}} other individuals and groups both within, and across cultures. My specific approach, combining domestic space, namely the,kitchen, and feminism, sexuality, gender, memory and politics has not previously been undertaken. Feminist literature has largely criticised the domestic unit and domestic labour as being private, gendered, oppressive and endowing women with the responsibility of social reproduction. Kitchen practices, cuisine, and <b>food</b> <b>rituals</b> have been studied and largely articulated as an expression of cultural identity and consumption, gender power relations, technology, class, desire, taste and style. However, such criticism seems to have remained locked in a heteronormative discourse. My approach draws on key aspects of cross-cultural perspectives on social space (e. g. Humphrey 1974, de Certeau 1986, Bourdieu 1990, Carsten and Hugh-Jones 1995, Das et al 2008) often studied beyond Europe. Here, seemingly private 'home' space is problematised within a western metropolis with gendered, historical specificity. The core focus is to illustrate the potential in using the kitchen as a 'spatial category' for conceptualising relationships between groups, kin or otherwise, but also relationships between individuals; different realms of life; and the rationale or logic that informants creatively engage in {{to make sense of the}} world. The subjects in this study group were of several nationalities and class origins (British, Irish, Swiss, Scottish, Canadian, American, German-British) and between 45 and 76 years at the time of research. They all identified as lesbians. The research was conducted from an anthropological perspective but required an interdisciplinary approach that included insights from cultural geography, feminism, social gerontology, sociology and architectural history. As my findings suggest, through the kitchen 'spatial' stories narrated by older lesbians, the kitchen emerged as a tangle of cultural norms, customs, duties, ideas, aspirations, expectations, and values that tells about the thinking process and behaviour of a specific society or group of people. In this context, the kitchen brings out the experiences of social inequalities experienced by older lesbians, mainly brought out by the hegemonic institution of heteronormativity and patriarchy. This understanding mirrors the different ideological and political dimensions flowing through the kitchen such as, gender/sexual issues, family dynamics, modernity, urbanism, social contradiction, religion, ethnicity, class, feminism and financial background. Many had to confront the stigma of sexual identity with punitive legal and political consequences, risking even the loss of their children. The domestic kitchen, ostensibly comfortingly neutral and a-political, emerges as a complex and multi-faceted place, where its meaning is temporal, relational and contextual.
