5|$|At the 2007 World Championships, Lysacek {{made his}} first attempt at landing a quadruple jump in the short program. He {{attempted}} a quad-triple, but {{stepped out of the}} quad and put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>down,</b> and followed it with a double. He placed fifth in the short program and earned himself his first new short program personal best in two years. In the long program, he completed a quadruple toe-loop as the first part of a quad-triple combination, but lost control of the landing, adding a three turn after it, and was unable to complete the following triple as intended. He performed a double loop instead of a planned triple loop and placed fifth once again in the long program, placing fifth over all.|$|E
2500|$|Walt began debating {{with the}} warrant officer who mined the bridge {{but it was}} fruitless; the Vietnamese rebel told him [...] "General, we will die together" [...] and brought <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>down.</b> Another rebel officer, a {{military}} engineer, plunged the detonator. Walt recalled that [...] "There was no doubt he expected the bridge to blow on his signal". However, the Americans had sent military engineers to defuse the explosives on the bridge and at the munitions dump, ending the standoff.|$|E
2500|$|Ha had {{previously}} heard of Master Leng’s ability to tear at {{the flesh of}} his opponents with his bare hands, so he wrapped his torso with a leather strap prior to the fight. [...] Both men met on the lei tai some time later and signed a contract that stated the fight could end in death. [...] The crowd watched as both initiated combat. [...] After a few moments, Leng (apparently seeing the leather straps through his ripped clothing) bypassed Ha’s armor by forcing <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> {{from the top of}} the wrap and tore out the triad boss’ bowels. [...] When Ha fell dead to the stage, his men tried attacking Leng to exact revenge, but the local police quickly arrested Leng to protect him. He was eventually set free.|$|E
6000|$|... "Her love!" [...] said Larry, {{chucking}} {{the stick}} which he held in <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>down</b> {{to the ground}} and then stooping to pick it up again.|$|R
60|$|Paul put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>down</b> to {{the bottom}} of his pockets. They were all one hole, and that sad lost foolish look came over his wan face again, and startled Mr. Cope.|$|R
60|$|VIVIE [striking <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>down</b> sharply] Off with you: Vivvums {{is not in}} a humor for petting {{her little}} boy this evening. [She rises and comes forward {{to the other side of}} the room].|$|R
2500|$|... 1,000 {{years before}} [...] "the Age of Arthur" [...] (approximately 1,033 {{years before the}} Present Day), Merlin and a friend, Adda, were deserters from an army and were {{trekking}} through a desert, desperate for water. Merlin saw a light and ran after it, revealed to be the Holy Grail, {{on top of a}} stone. Thinking that it was sacred, Merlin initially refuses to touch it, but his friend, Abbas, disregards his warnings and decides to drink from it anyway. When his friend grabbed it, he turned to ashes. Merlin then grabbed the grail after praying to God for permission, and was able to drink from it. When he put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>down,</b> he realized he had magic. The desert was no more — only lush greenery and forests. 500 years later, Merlin is at a village healing people, where his apprentice informs him of a woman who escaped a burning village. Merlin meets the woman, who introduces herself as Nimue. She wants revenge on Vortigan, the masked man responsible. She also had Middlemist flowers to offer, as their survival will guarantee a form of revenge. Merlin agrees to help her and places the seeds in a planter, and he uses his magic to grow them instantly. Over {{the course of the next}} several months, they fall in love, and Merlin reveals the truth about the Grail and how he acquired magic. He expresses a wish to reforge the grail into a sword that can destroy his immortality, so that he can live a normal mortal life with Nimue as his wife. However, as they start their quest, it turns out that Vortigan has been watching them.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bullsom hesitated. He drew <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> his stubbly grey beard.|$|E
60|$|The {{landlord}} brought <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>down,</b> {{with a heavy}} smack, on Leigh's shoulder.|$|E
5000|$|This was in {{what some}} of the fighters call the most {{exciting}} fight of the season. Also, White nicknames Walsh a zombie for the way he just kept coming forward with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>down</b> when hit.|$|R
60|$|It was Mr. Britling {{who broke}} silence. And when he drew <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>down</b> from <b>his</b> face and spoke, {{he said one}} of the most amazing and {{unexpected}} things she had ever heard in her life.|$|R
60|$|It was {{impossible}} to help laughing at my poor father's comical expression of chagrin, as {{he sat on the}} edge of his bed, slapped <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>down</b> on both knees and looked up in my face.|$|R
60|$|He put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> {{firmly on}} the table, and set his sunburnt face into a {{resolute}} expression.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My poor beast {{is nearly}} done for,' Reuben remarked, leaning forward and passing <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> the creature's reeking neck.|$|E

25|$|Cutting <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> off, <b>down</b> in Hell.|$|R
60|$|This action, though vividly {{illustrated}} by Jim's throwing <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>down</b> like feet beneath him, and indicating the parabola of a {{spring in the}} air, proving altogether too much for Clarence's mind to grasp, he timidly turned to a less difficult detail.|$|R
50|$|Moses {{watched from}} above. While When he held <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> up, Israel took the {{military}} advantage. Whenever he put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>down,</b> {{according to the}} Biblical account, they began to lose. When Moses became tired, his companions sat him on a stone and supported <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> The battle lasted until the evening, ending in victory for the Israelites.|$|R
60|$|Grampus {{stretched}} <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> {{into the}} hollow of the pollard and dragged up a rotting fox by its tail.|$|E

60|$|David {{only said}} {{it over again}} in the same words, and put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> on her letter in his earnestness.|$|E
60|$|Fred drew <b>his</b> mother's <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> to <b>his</b> lips, {{but said}} nothing.|$|R
6000|$|I saw him draw <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>down</b> <b>his</b> face--the vague stir of {{the passionate}} and {{meaningless}} gesture; but he waited in silent patience. It {{was only when}} the lights had been brought out that he opened his lips. I understood his mumble to mean that [...] "he didn't know any game." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Well, sir,’ {{returned}} the professional Philanthropist, {{getting up and}} thrusting <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>down</b> into <b>his</b> trousers-pockets, ‘I don’t go about measuring people for caps. If people find I have any about me that fit ’em, they can put ’em on and wear ’em, if they like. That’s their look out: not mine.’ ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Waring brought <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> {{with a bang}} on the table, causing Mr. Wilberfloss to leap a clear {{two inches}} from his chair.|$|E
60|$|Turning {{down the}} leather {{of his right}} boot, he thrust <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> {{the side of his}} leg. But Kenneth sprang back with a cry.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] murmured the desperado, and ran <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> the mare's nose. But {{this made}} her skittish, and she stamped sharply {{half a dozen}} times.|$|E
60|$|Laverick, who {{had been}} {{standing}} with the instrument in <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> sat <b>down</b> in <b>his</b> chair.|$|R
2500|$|A former {{nurse said}} she saw Savile molest a brain-damaged patient at Leeds hospital, saying, [...] "He kissed her, and I {{thought he was}} a visitor coming to see her, and he started rubbing <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>down</b> her arms and then I don't know of a nice way to put it but he molested her." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Tom {{went forward}} with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>down.</b> [...] "Look here, Mitcham, you can't see, and I can hardly stand. I {{think we have}} both done enough. We neither of us can give in, well because--because I am a gentleman, you because you are bigger than I am; so let's shake hands, and say no more about it." ...|$|R
60|$|A faint flush {{coloured}} Bee's cheeks. It {{hurt her}} a little that he should agree; but her lover was passing <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> the mare's shin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Leigh, {{you are a}} genius!" [...] Martin exclaimed, {{bringing}} <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> on the lad's {{shoulder with}} a force that almost knocked him from his seat.|$|E
6000|$|Lane brought <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> on the table, and, {{for some}} unexplainable reason, I {{actually}} believed {{him as he}} said: [...] "Gaspard's Trail was burnt by accident." ...|$|E
60|$|Seeing {{that his}} audiences were {{becoming}} smaller every Sunday, a Minister of the Gospel broke {{off in the}} midst of a sermon, descended the pulpit stairs, and walked on <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>down</b> the central aisle of the church. He then remounted his feet, ascended to the pulpit, and resumed his discourse, making no allusion to the incident.|$|R
60|$|And on the word, emotion {{overcoming}} prudence, {{he brought}} <b>his</b> fat <b>hand</b> <b>down</b> with a resounding smack on my bowed shoulders.|$|R
6000|$|... "Joan Valentine!" [...] cried Judson, {{bringing}} <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>down</b> on {{the tablecloth}} with a bang. [...] "I've just remembered it. That {{was the name}} of the girl Freddie used to write the letters and poems to; and that's who it is I've been trying all along to think you reminded me of, Miss Simpson. You're the living image of Freddie's Miss Joan Valentine." ...|$|R
