5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit. Such cigars are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting <b>end</b> <b>or</b> with a non-chemical device that ruptures the cigar when exposed to heat. The customary intended purpose of exploding cigars is {{as a form of}} hostile practical joke, rather than to cause lasting physical harm to the butt of the joke. Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{underwent}} extensive refits {{near the}} <b>end</b> <b>or</b> after the war. North Carolina received a secondary air search set (SR) and a SCR-720 zenith search radar on the forward funnel. At {{the end of}} the war, it had an SP surface-search, a SK-2 air-search, a Mark 38 main battery fire control system with Mark 13 and 27 radars, a Mark 37 secondary battery fire control system with Mark 12, 22 and 32 radars, and a Mark 57 smaller weaponry fire control system, with a Mark 34 radar. In March 1946, Washington had a SK fore and a SR aft, a SG both fore and aft, and a TDY jammer (which could scramble radar on other ships).|$|E
5|$|Did Siletzia pivot {{about its}} {{northern}} <b>end</b> <b>or</b> southern end? This question has attracted considerable attention, {{with the evidence}} now favoring a northern pivot. A key piece of evidence is that the Crescent Formation is laid over sediments (the Blue Mountain unit) derived from the continent, including boulders of quartz diorite some 65 million years old; this requires the Crescent Formation to have formed close to the continent.|$|E

5|$|In other tables, {{lutetium}} and lawrencium {{are classified}} as the remaining members of group 3. In these tables, lutetium and lawrencium <b>end</b> (<b>or</b> sometimes succeed) the lanthanide and actinide series, respectively. Since the f-shell is nominally full in the ground state electron configuration for both of these metals, they behave most similarly to other period 6 and period 7 transition metals {{compared to the other}} lanthanides and actinides, and thus logically exhibit properties similar to those of scandium and yttrium. However, this resemblance in not unique to lutetium and lawrencium, but is common among all the late lanthanides and actinides.|$|E
5|$|Jay Harrington, {{who plays}} Ted Crisp on the show, serves {{both as a}} main {{character}} and as an on-camera narrator. Throughout the show, he breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to viewers, offering inside information and observations while the action continues around him. Another plot element {{involves the use of}} mock commercials for Veridian Dynamics, thematically related to individual episodes and placed at the <b>end</b> <b>or</b> beginning of actual commercial breaks in all but a couple of episodes.|$|E

5|$|The course {{consisted}} of eight obstacles {{which had to}} be completed within 60 seconds. Each obstacle had an orange flag either at its <b>end</b> <b>or</b> hidden within it. One team member ran the first obstacle, then passed its flag to a partner, who then moved on to the next obstacle. The team continued to alternate in this manner until they had completed the course or until time ran out. For safety reasons, team members were given helmets, elbow pads, and knee pads to wear while running the course.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrounding}} area is partly residential, and includes the major St Mary's Hospital, restaurants and hotels. Until recently {{there was little}} office accommodation in the area, and most commuters interchanged between National Rail and the London Underground to reach workplaces in the West <b>End</b> <b>or</b> the City. However, recent redevelopment of derelict railway and canal land, marketed as Paddington Waterside, has resulted in new office complexes nearby.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{traditional}} piercing techniques, modern body adornment includes variant {{techniques such}} as pocketing and flesh stapling, although as of 2007 these were still not widely made available by piercers. In the first of these, a scalpel opens the skin or mucous membranes, into which the larger end {{of a piece of}} jewellery or—if using a bar—two ends are inserted. These kinds of piercings may be difficult to remove, as fibrous tissue can form around the <b>end</b> <b>or</b> ends of the jewellery or the implanted tube into which the jewellery is placed. When a bar is used, pocketing looks quite similar to flesh stapling. The latter technique is frequently done {{in the form of a}} ladder. Modern body piercing practices also include dermal anchoring or dermal piercing, which combines piercing and implantation to create a single point of opening in the body (whereas pocketing creates two) to permit one end of the jewellery to show above the surface of the skin. While this technique can be performed almost anywhere on the body, as of 2007 it was popularly done between the eyes, on the chest, or on the finger, to simulate a ring.|$|E

5|$|Commander Keen is a side-scrolling {{platform}} video game: {{the majority}} of the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. The player can move left and right and can jump, and can use a pogo stick to bounce continuously and jump higher than they can normally with the correct timing. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, viewed from the side as in the original Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons trilogy, and some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below. The game also includes moving platforms and teleporters that Keen can respectively jump on and interact with. In between levels, the player travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map, the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the <b>end,</b> <b>or</b> by resetting the game. When a level is completed, the player is given a password that records their progress, lives, and points; this password is entered when starting the game in order to resume where the player left off. The game is divided into three worlds, connected by a central hub area where the game begins and where Keen starts whenever a password is entered.|$|E
5|$|Marriages among ruling dynasties {{and their}} {{subjects}} have at times been common, with the marriages {{such as that}} of Edward the Confessor, King of England with Edith of Wessex and Władysław II Jagiełło, King of Poland with Elizabeth Granowska being far from unheard of in medieval Europe. However, as dynasties approached absolutism and sought to preserve loyalty among competing members of the nobility, most eventually distanced themselves from kinship ties to local nobles by marrying abroad. Marriages with subjects brought the king back down to the level of those he ruled, often stimulating the ambition of his consort's family and evoking jealousy—or disdain—from the nobility. The notion that monarchs should marry into the dynasties of other monarchs to <b>end</b> <b>or</b> prevent war was, at first, a policy driven by pragmatism. During the era of absolutism, this practice contributed to the notion that it was socially, as well as politically, disadvantageous for members of ruling families to intermarry with their subjects and pass over the opportunity for marriage into a foreign dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The spores are spherical, and ornamented with warts and ridges {{that form}} a partial {{reticulum}} (a net-like pattern of lines) with prominences up to 2µm high. They are hyaline (translucent), amyloid (meaning they will absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent), and measure 7.5–10.0 by 7–9.5µm. The cap cuticle is a trichoderm. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are 38–56 by 10–13µm, club-shaped, four-spored, and hyaline when mounted in a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH). There are abundant cheilocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} edge of gills), with contents ranging in color from dingy yellow to hyaline in KOH. They measure 32–50 by 3-6µm, and may be shaped somewhat like a spindle (tapered on each <b>end)</b> <b>or</b> a cylinder, or they may be flexuous (winding from side to side). The pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the gill face) are , 2.5–5µm in diameter, and rare to scattered.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Ezeh {{entered his}} senior season as {{the focal point of}} his school's running game and was rated as the seventh-best {{football}} prospect in the state of Michigan, according to The Detroit News. He was also invited to try out for the United States national rugby union team as an outside center. During the season, Ezeh was regularly among the leading rushers in the area. In the Division 4 state semifinal game, Ezeh returned a kickoff 80yards for a touchdown and rushed for 136yards on 24 carries. During the game, after Catholic Central scored on a quarterback sneak with 2:28 remaining, Ezeh scored on a two-point conversion to give his team a 3534 victory. This led them to the 2005 MHSAA state championship game at Ford Field, which they lost 1710 to Powers Catholic High School. By the end of the season, Ezeh had compiled a school record 2,914 career rushing yards, which included 33 touchdowns. During his senior year, he also occasionally played linebacker, recording 34 tackles (16 for a loss). Although, he missed part of the season with an ankle injury, he totaled 1,391yards and 10 touchdowns on 217 carries and added seven pass receptions, including one touchdown, and he was recognized as a 2nd-team All-area running back. The Detroit News recognized him as their postseason number six blue chip prospect in the state, and he was selected to play in the Michigan High School Football Coaches Association's annual all-star game. In February 2006, he signed his letter of intent to play for Michigan, where it was unclear whether he would play fullback, tight <b>end</b> <b>or</b> linebacker.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{learns that}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{will be taking}} {{a leave of absence}} to go on jury duty for the Scranton Strangler trial, leading the {{corporate}} office to send Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) to cover for him. Michael forces Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to plan a second, classier Christmas party on the day Holly returns to Scranton. Michael welcomes Holly back, but becomes upset when she tells him that she and A.J. (Rob Huebel) are still in a relationship. Holly then tells the women of the office that she's giving A.J. an ultimatum: either propose to her by year's <b>end</b> <b>or</b> their relationship is over. Michael lies to Holly and tells her that he's seeing a woman named Tara from New York, and Holly shows curiosity, but Michael interprets this as potential jealousy. When Michael gets further upset over hearing about Holly's relationship with A.J., he takes her toy Woody from Toy Story—a present from A.J.—throws it in the trash, and pours his coffee on it. When Holly demands to know who did it, Michael comes forward and admits that he still has feelings for her and is hurt that, while they had to break up due to their long distance, she is nevertheless able to make such an arrangement work with A.J. This, in turn, makes her feel bad for Michael. A.J. arrives in Scranton to surprise Holly and Michael welcomes him politely. After cleaning Holly's Woody, he leaves the office and Pam follows him out, where he breaks down. In order to lift his spirits, Pam tells him about Holly's ultimatum, suggesting their relationship is not going to last very long. He returns to the party where he overhears Holly and A.J. talking about Woody, with Holly fabricating a story to cover for Michael's actions.|$|E
