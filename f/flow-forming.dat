40|$|Abstract [...] This {{research}} {{describes the}} performance {{data of the}} aluminum automobile wheel manufactured by wheel flow forming machine. The performance is examined after designing and operating the CNC controller which is customized for the wheel <b>flow-forming</b> machine. In general, the existing wheel <b>flow-forming</b> machine simultaneously controls the 3 rollers and axis, which results in the degradation {{of the quality of}} the product due to syncing to the slowest one and slowing down in its processing speed. In order to solve this problem, multi-channel CNC controller has been developed and is able to independently control each individual roller and axis in short cycles. In order to practice the multi-channel CNC, the mutual communication of the fundamental structure of the CNC controller utilizes sync signal and each thread is applied with the sharing memory data sync method through the EtherCAT communication. When producing wheel forming by utilizing the customized CNC controller, it has been found that there had been a great improvement in processing time (productivity) and degree of precision, in comparison to the existing wheel <b>flow-forming</b> machine. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} forming {{temperature}} and feed rate on the flaring of AZ 31 magnesium cups {{was investigated in}} the warm <b>flow-forming</b> process. Flaring is a common phenomenon in <b>flow-forming</b> process whereby {{the diameter of the}} work-piece is observed to increase gradually along the flow-formed path. In this study, forward <b>flow-forming</b> process was performed on a cup-shaped work-piece by using two diametrically opposite rollers (approach angle of 20 °) at a constant thickness reduction. To study the effects on flaring, experiments were performed at feed rates of 0. 2 mm/rev, 0. 4 mm/rev, and 0. 8 mm/rev and at forming temperatures between 50 ~ 300 °C. Experimental results indicated that feed rate was the most significant parameter influencing flaring while temperature mainly improve the formability of the material. It is believed that a higher feed rate resulted in an increase in metal flow in the circumferential direction because of higher mean circumferential strain and hence increases flaring. Flaring was also observed to be most severe at forming temperature of 300 °C and feed rate of 0. 8 mm/rev due to the excessive metal flow in the cirucmferential direction of the test-piece. This study clarifies the relationship between feed rate and the extend of flaring and that forming temperature has little influence on flaring from temperature range of 50 °C to 250 °C...|$|E
40|$|Tungurahua is a {{frequently}} {{active and}} hazardous volcano of the Ecuadorian Andes that has experienced pyroclastic <b>flow-forming</b> eruption in 1773, 1886, 1916 – 18 and 2006 – 08. Earlier eruptions in Late Pre-Hispanic and Early Colonial times have remained poorly known and are debated in the literature. To reconstruct the eruptive chronology {{in that time}} interval we examine relevant historical narratives recently found in Sevilla, Spain, and Rome, Italy, and we combine stratigraphic field constraints with 22 new radiocarbon age determinations. Results show that pyroclastic <b>flow-forming</b> eruptions and tephra falls took place repeatedly since ~ 700 14 C yr BP, when the Tungurahua region was already populated. Radiocarbon ages averaging around 625 yr BP reveal a period of notable eruptive activity in the 14 th century (Late Integration cultural period). The associated andesitic eruptions produced ash and scoria falls of regional extent and left scoria flow deposits on the western flanks of the edifice. The fact that Tungurahua was known by the Puruhás Indians as a volcano {{at the time of}} the Spanish Conquest in 1533 perhaps refers to these eruptions. A group of ages ranging from 380 to 270 yr BP is attributed to younger periods of activity that also predates the 1773 event, and calibration results yield eruption dates from late 15 th to late 17 th centuries (i. e. Inca and Early Colonial Periods). The historical narratives mention an Early Colonial eruption between the Spanish Conquest and the end of the 16 th century, followed by a distinct eruptive period in the 1640 s. The descriptions are vague but point to destructive eruptions likely accompanied by pyroclastic flows. The dated tephras consist of andesitic scoria flow deposits and the contemporaneous fallout layers occur to the west. These findings reveal that the eruption recurrence rate at Tungurahua is at least one pyroclastic <b>flow-forming</b> event per century since the 13 th century and the occurrence of such eruptions in 2006 – 08 is thus fully consistent with the rate inferred for the past seven centuries. In addition, historical chronicles suggest that a notch opened in the crater margin during the 1640 decade, as has occurred repeatedly in the past millennium at Tungurahua. Such small-volume collapse events represent a previously unrecognized source of hazards which deserve special attention for risk assessment purposes in the context of the currently ongoing eruption. ...|$|E

In order to predict possible future trends in extreme hydrological events in the context of climate change, it is essential to estimate the contribution of different feed sources in complicated <b>flow-forming</b> processes in the alpine part of the North Caucasus. A study was carried out for the Djankuat River basin, the representative for the North Caucasus system. Simultaneous measurements of electrical conductivity, isotopic and ion balance equations, and energy balance modeling of ice and snow melt were used to evaluate the contribution of different sources and processes in the Djankuat River runoff regime formation.

40|$|Aircraft engine {{components}} are often an assembly of several parts that are manufactured using various processes: deep drawing, machining, among others. Sheet metal forming requires expensive tooling and is performed in numerous steps, increasing lead-time. Furthermore, with the ever increasing costs of raw material, machining parts out of forged or cast rings is becoming less cost effective as up to 90 % {{of the material}} can be wasted. For these reasons, the use of near net shape manufacturing methods is becoming inevitable. An alternative forming process is here investigated: <b>flow-forming,</b> process well adapted to axisymmetric parts. The amount of forming steps, welding and machining could be significantly reduced, hence reducing lead-time and manufacturing costs. Metallurgical and mechanical properties of a flowformed case will be presented and compared with material characteristics of cases manufactured by machining of forged rings. It will be shown that both forming processes yield to equivalent results. Aircraft {{engine components}} are often an assembly of several parts (e. g. combustion chamber) that ar...|$|E
40|$|Crystal size {{measurements}} {{have been}} carried out on tephra fall layers of Miocene to recent age from Sites 998, 999, and 1000 in the western Caribbean Sea. Maximum crystal size is used as a proxy for the grain size characteristics of the layers and an index of atmospheric dispersal from source eruptions. Crystal sizes range from 50 to 650 µm with the majority falling between 200 and 300 µm. All three sites exhibit a coarsening in the grain size of tephra layers with increasing age to the early Miocene that broadly correlates with an increase in the frequency of layers. Analysis of the present lower and upper level atmospheric circulation in the western Caribbean suggests that the layers were derived from source eruptions {{to the west of the}} sites somewhere in the Central American region. Minimum distances to these sources are of the order of 700 km. Crystal sizes in tephra layers at these distances are consistent with their derivation from energetic pyroclastic <b>flow-forming</b> eruptions that injected tephra to stratospheric levels by large-scale co-ignimbrite and plinian-style plumes. Coarsening of the layers during the Miocene peak of explosive volcanism cannot be attributed to any major change in paleowind intensity and is taken to represent the occurrence of more energetic eruptions that were able to disperse tephra over larger areas...|$|E
40|$|The Colli Albani Volcanic District, located 15 km SE of Rome (Fig. 1), {{is part of}} the Roman Magmatic Province, a belt of potassic to ultra-potassic {{volcanic}} {{districts that}} developed along the Tyrrhenian Sea margin since Middle Pleistocene time (Conticelli and Peccerillo, 1992; Marra et al., 2004; Giordano et al., 2006 and references therein). Eruption centers are aligned along NW-SE oriented majorextensional structures guiding the dislocation of Meso-Cenozoic siliceous-carbonate sedimentary successions {{at the rear of the}} Apennine belt. Volcanic districts developed in structural sectors with most favorable conditions for magma uprise. In particular, the Colli Albani volcanism is located in a N-S shear zone where it intersects the extensional NW- and NE-trending fault systems. In the last decade, geochronological measurements allowed for reconstructions of the eruptive history and led to the classification as "dormant" volcano. The volcanic history may be roughly subdivided into three main phases marked by different eruptive mechanisms andmagma volumes. The early Tuscolano-Artemisio Phase (ca. 561 – 351 ky), the most explosive and voluminous one, is characterized by five large pyroclastic <b>flow-forming</b> eruptions. After a ~ 40 -ky-long dormancy, a lesser energetic phase of activity took place (Faete Phase; ca. 308 – 250 ky), which started with peripheral effusive eruptions coupled with subordinate hydromagmatic activity. A new ~ 50 -ky-long dormancypreceded the start of the late hydromagmatic phase (ca. 200 – 36 ky), which was dominated by pyroclastic-surge eruptions, with formation of several monogenetic or multiple maars and/or tuff rings...|$|E
40|$|Spaceborne {{remote sensing}} {{techniques}} and numerical simulations have been combined in a web-GIS framework (LAV@HAZARD) to evaluate lava flow hazard in real time. By using the HOTSAT satellite thermal monitoring system to estimate time-varying TADR (time averaged discharge rate) and the MAGFLOW physicsbased model to simulate lava flow paths, the LAV@HAZARD platform allows timely definition of parameters and maps essential for hazard assessment, including the propagation time of lava flows and the maximum run-out distance. We used LAV@HAZARD during the 2008 – 2009 lava <b>flow-forming</b> eruption at Mt Etna (Sicily, Italy). We measured the temporal variation in thermal emission (up {{to four times}} per hour) during the entire duration of the eruption using SEVIRI and MODIS data. The time-series of radiative power allowed us to identify six diverse thermal phases each related to different dynamic volcanic processes and associated with different TADRs and lava flow emplacement conditions. Satellite-derived estimates of lava discharge rates were computed and integrated for the whole period of the eruption (almost 14 months), showing that a lava volume of between 32 and 61 million cubic meters was erupted of which about 2 / 3 was emplaced during the first 4 months. These time-varying discharge rates were then used to drive MAGFLOW simulations to chart the spread of lava {{as a function of}} time. TADRs were sufficiently low (b 30 m 3 /s) that no lava flows were capable of flowing any great distance so that they did not pose a hazard to vulnerable (agricultural and urban) areas on the flanks of Etna...|$|E

Report on the effect of SBVG on three common flows of interest; a zero pressure gradient, an equilibrium pressure gradient and a 2 D turbulent boundary layer flow separation. Four Generic designs of passive vortex generator have been studied and one active design using pulsed air jets 2. Studies have been performed in the DERA Bedford Boundary Layer Tunnel. The tunnel is of open return design with a long working section 1. 2 m wide by a nominal 0. 3 m high. The tunnel floor is flexible and the growth of boundary layers along the working section can be controlled by the developed local pressure gradient 1. More highly complex flows can be achieved by additionally fixing <b>flow-forming</b> structures within the working section. The LDA system used two TSI fibre optic coupled probe units fitted with beam expansion optics and 205 mm diameter, 1540 mm focal length lenses. Probes were configured as a symmetric system with a subtended half angle of 20. 1 ° and mounted on a 0. 6 m motion three-axis traverse. Data collection utilised Dantec enhanced BSA processors and software. Results presented characterise downstream circulation, vortex position, trajectory and persistence with methods of SBVG classification by non-dimensional parameters. The effect of pressure gradient on downstream flow is demonstrated. It is shown that SBVG devices with heights in the order of only one quarter of the boundary layer can significantly reduce the size of regions containing turbulent boundary layer separated flow...|$|E
40|$|Material {{selection}} {{is a very}} critical design decision, which has a profound influence on the entire development program for rocket motor cases. In the selection process, the main performance parameters and the most appropriate fabrication technology with proven processes must be considered. Many years of practical experience in material selection process with {{a thorough understanding of}} materials behavior under various loading environments and hands-on experiences with various available manufacturing processes are of immense help to the design and development engineer for successful completion of the development program. In this paper, an attempt has been made to present an approach for selecting appropriate material and manufacturing process for rocket motor case based on method of Weighted Performance Index (WPI) with the hope that this approach will also provide additional aid to the design engineer for the selection of material and manufacturing process for rocket motor cases. In this method, different properties are assigned a certain weight depending upon their importance to the service requirements. Different properties are normalized using a scaling factor, and finally a weighted property index is computed. The material that scored the maximum numerical value is chosen as the material for fabrication. This approach closely matches with the actual performance. Maraging steel and D 6 AC are found to be the preferred materials for rocket motor cases for critical missions. HSLA steels are appropriate for less-critical applications, in which rocket motor cases are required in very large numbers (e. g., flow-formed AISI 4130 motor cases([8])). For the selection of an appropriate manufacturing method, the major parameters considered are dimensional accuracy, cost of production, minimum material waste, and flexibility in design. Again, these properties are given a relative grading, which is then converted into a scaled property. Finally, the weighted performance indices are estimated. The <b>flow-forming</b> method has emerged as the manufacturing method of choice for motor tubes...|$|E
40|$|The early {{activity}} of the Sabatini Volcanic District (SVD; central Italy) was characterised by highly explosive eruptions that produced widespread subplinian and plinian fall deposits. In this study, four major eruptive units-informally named as units A, B, C and D-were recognised in the 514 - 449 ka age interval. In particular, unit D was emplaced during the early phase of the 449 ka Tufo Rosso a Scorie Nere pyroclastic <b>flow-forming</b> eruption, the most important event in the whole SVD activity history. Estimates of relevant eruptive parameters indicate tephra fall volumes up to 4 km 3 for individual units, peak eruption column heights {{in the range of}} 14 - 29 km and corresponding mass eruption rates of 7. 8 × 106 - 1. 3 × 108 kg/s. Isopach and isopleth maps of fallout deposits-as well as the distribution of the proximal lag-breccia of the Tufo Rosso a Scorie Nere -consistently indicate a common vent area, which does not correspond to any volcanic centre identified up to now in the SVD. This was located along NE-SW-trending tectonic lineaments that also controlled the location of the other major volcanic centres of the SVD. The characterisation by means of field aspects, grain size, componentry and density and chemical composition of juvenile clasts, renders the studied fall deposits as valuable stratigraphic markers for the SVD and well beyond it. In fact, their wide areal dispersals toward the E and SE may allow correlations on a regional scale for the Quaternary successions of intermountain basins of the Central Apennine and the Adriatic Sea basin successions. Finally, the correct identification of distal tephra from plinian and co-ignimbrite plumes and their attribution to specific explosive eruptions of the SVD and the other volcanic districts of the Roman Province-rather than to local intra-Apennine centres-provides crucial implications for geodynamic reconstructions. © 2004 Elsevier B.

Here we investigate these options by performing a high-resolution mass budget analysis of the scoria fall deposit. This is achieved by analysing componentry compositions and their mass distribution pattern in the layer, which allow us to document and integrate exponential and power laws mass decay rates over wide areas. The results yield a total mass for the tephra layer of ∼ 2 × 1010 kg. The pumice mass fraction is far too small (< 0. 4 %) to account for the high explosivity of the 2006 event.

Flow structure indicates {{a change from}} a less viscous, <b>flow-forming</b> lava which produced an exogenous dome to a more viscous lava which formed endogenous domes. Associated pyroclastic deposits are negligible. The volcanic rocks are composed of porphyritic rhyolite and rhyolitic vitrophyre having phenocrysts of quartz, sanidine, plagioclase and biotite with minor amounts of Fe-Ti oxides, hypersthene, allanite and calcic amphibole. Quartz and sanidine phenocrysts are generally embayed whereas plagioclase phenocrysts are euhedral and extensively zoned.

Manufacturing {{on this scale}} will benefit from more efficient fabrication methods. The current methods of fabricating SRF cavities involve deep drawing of the halves {{of each of the}} elliptical cells and joining them by high-vacuum, electron beam welding, with at least 19 circumferential welds per cavity. The welding is costly and has undesirable effects on the cavity surfaces, including grain-scale surface roughening at the weld seams. Hydroforming of seamless tubes avoids welding, but hydroforming of coarse-grained seamless tubes results in strain-induced surface roughening. Surface roughness limits accelerating fields, because asperities prematurely exceed the critical magnetic field and become normal conducting. This project explored the technical and economic feasibility of an improved processing method for seamless tubes for hydroforming. Severe deformation of bulk material was first used to produce a fine structure, followed by extrusion and <b>flow-forming</b> methods of tube making. Extrusion of the randomly oriented, fine-grained bulk material proceeded under largely steady-state conditions, and resulted in a uniform structure, which was found to be finer and more crystallographically random than standard (high purity) RRR niobium sheet metal. A 165 mm diameter billet of RRR grade niobium was processed into five, 150 mm I. D. tubes, each over 1. 8 m in length, to meet the dimensions used by the DESY ILC hydroforming machine. Mechanical properties met specifications. Costs of prototype tube production were approximately twice the price of RRR niobium sheet, and are expected to be comparable with economies of scale. Hydroforming and superconducting testing will be pursued in subsequent collaborations with DESY and Fermilab. SRF Cavities are used to construct particle accelerators for high-energy physics research, as well as for lower energy particle accelerators, and Free Electron Lasers. These machines have applications in the fields of basic science, industrial processing, medical diagnostics, pharmaceutical research and weapons systems.

40|$|Mechanically alloyed oxide {{dispersion}} strengthened (ODS) Fe-Cr-Al alloy {{thin walled}} tubes and sheets, produced via powder processing and consolidation methodologies are promising materials for eventual use at temperatures up to 1200 C {{in the power}} generation industry, far above the temperature capabilities of conventional alloys. Target end-uses range from gas turbine combustor liners to high aspect ratio (L/D) heat exchanger tubes. Grain boundary creep processes at service temperatures, particularly those acting in the hoop direction, are the dominant failure mechanisms for such components. The processed microstructure of ODS alloys consists of high aspect ratio grains aligned parallel to the tube axis, a result of dominant axial metal flow which aligns the dispersoid particles and other impurities in the longitudinal direction. The dispersion distribution is unaltered on a micro scale by recrystallization thermal treatments, but the high aspect ratio grain shape typically obtained limits transverse grain spacing and consequently the hoop creep response. Improving hoop creep in ODS-alloy components will require understanding and manipulating the factors that control the recrystallization behavior, and represents a critical materials design and development challenge that must be overcome in order to fully exploit the potential of ODS alloys. The objectives of this program were to (1) increase creep-strength at temperature in ODS-alloy tube and liner components by 100 % via, (2) preferential cross-roll flow forming and grain/particle fibering in the critical hoop direction. The research program outlined was iterative and intended to systematically (i) examine and identify post-extrusion forming methodologies to create hoop strengthened tubes, to be (ii) evaluated at 'in-service' loads at service temperatures and environments. Our report outlines the significant hoop creep enhancements possible via secondary cross-rolling and/or <b>flow-forming</b> operations. Each of the secondary processes i. e. hot rotary forming and ambient-temperature flow forming exhibited improvement over the base-line hoop-creep performance. The flow formed MA 956 tubes exhibited performance superior to all other rolling/forming variants.

The Larsen-Miller parameter for these improvised flow-formed tubes now exceeds 54. 14, i. e., better than ever recorded previously. The creep performance enhancement in cross-rolled MA 956 material samples versus the base creep property is elucidated. At least 2 - 3 orders of magnitude of improvement in creep rates/day and concomitant increases in creeplife are demonstrated for the flow formed tubes versus the base reference tests...|$|E
