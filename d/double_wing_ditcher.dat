50|$|The <b>double</b> <b>wing</b> (also: aviator wing) {{is part of}} the {{mounting}} loop to any uniform of the Luftwaffe. It is woven in the color of all other emblems (in most cases: black (image b.) - or gold-colored by general grads (image c.)). The <b>double</b> <b>wing,</b> also part of other elements on aviator´s uniform, serves as unmistakable discrimination feature to the stone-grey/ olive-colored mounting strap to the uniform of the Heer. <b>Double</b> <b>wing</b> mounting loops are longer and wider than other one`s. The <b>double</b> <b>wing</b> is even part of the otherwise empty mounting loop to the lowest private OR1-rank (de: Flieger; see image a.), in order to distinguish between the Air Force - and Army personnel in tarnfleck uniform.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Productivity {{simulation}} of multiple-fractured horizontal wells {{is the core}} technique during optimizing fracture’s amount and parameters. According to the dissymmetric <b>double</b> <b>wings</b> of multiple fractured high productivity horizontal gas well which is equality discreted, applying the theory of point source, the formula of unsteady seepage of gas and the principle of superposition, this paper deduce the model of overall pressure drop in formation considering the mutual interference of multi fracture. Besides, considering the high velocity non-Darcy’s flow’s effect to the fracture productivity in high horizontal gas well, establishing a more sophisticated new model to stimulate the fracture productivity in horizontal gas well. Via stimulation calculating and comparative analysing the high velocity non-Darcy’s flow, the dissymmetry of the <b>double</b> <b>wings</b> fracture, the length of fracture and the conductivity’s effect on the multiple fracture gas well’s productivity. This offers a more accurate method to optimizing the fracture’s amount in landscape and the parameters of fracture in high productivity gas well and making sure the proper production’s differential pressure...|$|R

During the Battle of Uman (3 to 8 August 1941), a mechanized body of the Carpathian Group formed <b>double</b> <b>wings</b> encircling the 6th and 12th Soviet units. During this struggle, 20 Soviet divisions were destroyed or surrendered.|$|R

These features, {{as well as the}} grosbeak's relatively larger size, distinguish this species from the indigo bunting. Length can range from 14 to 19 cm and wingspan is from 26 to 29 cm. Body mass is typically from 26 to 31.5 g.|$|R
5000|$|Glenn [...] "Pop" [...] Warner coached {{at several}} schools {{throughout}} his career, including the University of Georgia, Cornell University, University of Pittsburgh, Stanford University, and Temple University. One {{of his most}} famous stints was at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, where he coached Jim Thorpe, {{who went on to}} become the first president of the National Football League, an Olympic Gold Medalist, and is widely considered one of the best overall athletes in history. Warner wrote one of the first important books of football strategy, Football for Coaches and Players, published in 1927. [...] Though the shift was invented by Stagg, Warner's single <b>wing</b> and <b>double</b> <b>wing</b> formations greatly improved upon it; for almost 40 years, these were among the most important formations in football. As part of his single and <b>double</b> <b>wing</b> formations, Warner was one of the first coaches to effectively utilize the forward pass. Among his other innovations are modern blocking schemes, the three-point stance, and the reverse play. The youth football league, Pop Warner Little Scholars, was named in his honor.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} had an oval cross-section and {{was made}} of welded steel tubes, covered with fabric. The <b>double</b> <b>wings</b> provided very high lift, even at low speeds. Both wings had the same span and an 8° sweep. Construction consisted of a <b>double</b> pine <b>wing</b> spar structure, with lime tree ribs, and fabric covering. There were ailerons in both {{the upper and lower}} wings. The tail had a conventional design, with the horizontal stabilizers mounted on the fuselage upper edge. The rudder was placed behind the elevators. Both the rudder and the elevators were of steel tube covered in fabric, and had a bigger surface than the first version to correct balance problems. The steel tube undercarriage was attached to the fuselage in a [...] "V" [...] shape and used high-pressure rubber suspension.|$|R

Until 1960, the formation above would have been called a <b>double</b> <b>wing,</b> and the tailback labeled a fullback, there being {{no need for the}} tailback designation when the backs assume so few intermediate depths. However, the deep back position above is usually occupied by a player who habitually plays QB, so the habitual position name tends to stick, as with the [...] "extra tight end".|$|R
