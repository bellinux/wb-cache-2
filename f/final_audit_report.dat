40|$|A {{programme}} offering partial {{subsidies for}} energy audits was {{launched by the}} German Ministry of Economics in 2008. It is managed by the KfW, the German Promotional Bank. The purpose of the audits is to identify energy saving potentials in SMEs by qualified and independent consultants. They help to overcome know-how deficits and other obstacles whereas subsidies should encourage SMEs {{to make use of}} audits. The evaluation of this programme, which was performed in 2010, shows the effects of the scheme and gives recommendations for its optimisation. The study focused on empirical research: online surveys of the audited companies, consultants, and the "regional partners" who processed the applications, e. g. chambers of trade and commerce or energy agencies. In addition, <b>final</b> <b>audit</b> <b>reports</b> were analysed. The main aspects of the study were audit quality, implementation of proposed measures, remaining obstacles, and the effects of the programme in terms of energy savings, reduction of CO 2 emissions, and investments. The study revealed a very good image of the programme and a high implementation rate of the recommendations of the consultants. The consultants found substantial energy efficiency potentials in all the companies. On average, each company implemented 2. 8 out of 5. 3 recommended measures {{as a direct result of}} the energy audit. The measures implemented resulted in 1. 4 TWh energy savings per year, 470, 000 tons CO 2 reduction, investments of 480 million Euros, and energy cost savings of 80 million Euros. Programme costs amount to 0. 5 - 0. 7 Euro/ MWh energy saved. Success factors of the audit scheme include its low threshold access caused by the high level of funding, the support from the regional partners and their personal contacts to SMEs, and the generally high quality of the audits. The authors recommend to optimise the KfW consultants' list in the internet with regard to the search for competent consultants, especially those with know-how of branch-specific process technologies, and to improve further the <b>audit</b> <b>reports</b> by a more detailed specification of the content...|$|R
50|$|The {{next step}} would be to hire an {{independent}} certifier to do the CCB audit and validate the project. Currently, eligible CCB certifiers are the CDM certifiers (Designated Operational Entities - DOEs), like SGS, TÜV SÜD, etc., or the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certifiers (e.g., Rainforest Alliance).Once an independent certifier is chosen, a project design document can be created, {{with the assistance of}} the CCB Validation Guidance document, and submitted to the CCBA for validation. The CCB audit and validation should take about two months or sometimes more depending on the audit findings. Typically, the CCB auditor reviews all the project documents and once they find that the documentation is sufficient and appropriate to proceed with an audit they forward the documents to the CCBA for the mandatory public comment period. Once the auditor evaluates the responses they write up the <b>final</b> <b>audit</b> & validation <b>report</b> and forward this with their statement of conformance to CCB Standards to the CCBA for publication on the CCBA website. Then the project would be deemed “CCB validated”.|$|R

5000|$|McGill {{concluded}} {{that both the}} underlying findings at NEON {{as well as the}} order to remove those findings from the <b>final</b> <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> constituted fraud, waste, abuse, and/or corruption. As a result, he determined that he was obligated to report the matter by 5 CFR § 2635.101(b)(11) - the Code of Ethics for Executive Branch Employees. [...] Because McGill determined that he was required to report the alleged wrongdoing by both NEON and DCAA as part of his official duties, and because the Antideficiency Act prohibits Federal Employees from performing any of their official duties off the clock, McGill argued that blowing the whistle on the wrongdoing was actually part of his job, rather than a private act (as all whistleblowing had been prior to this point). [...] McGill argued that the Whistleblower Protection Act, as modified by the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 protected his activities as whistleblowing, {{at the same time as}} the Antideficiency Act and Code of Ethics required them. DCAA was forced to agree with his arguments, and McGill became the first Federal Employee authorized to perform protected whistleblowing activities on official time. This could have a major impact on the willingness of Federal Employees to blow the whistle, as prior to McGill all whistleblowing was performed on personal time - an expense many Federal Employees were not willing to bear.|$|E
5000|$|McGill {{notified}} retiredUnited States Army Criminal Investigation Command Agent Angela Janysek, {{then the}} Assistant Director of Internal Review at DCAA (and later its Inspector General), that {{the order to}} issue the clean audit report was illegal. The audit was sent to DCAA's Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern Regions for additional reviews. The Mid-Atlantic review concluded on March 14, 2014, that [...] "We don't comment on Management Fee. In, the nonprofit arena, {{this is how the}} contractor pays for unallowable costs and the agencies know this to be a fact" [...] - in other words, DCAA management was aware that [...] "management fees" [...] like the one at NEON are used to pay illegal costs, but had deliberately looked the other way. On June 27, 2014, the Northeastern Region review determined that none of McGill's major findings (including the lack of control, and the [...] "management fee") issues were legitimate, and ordered them removed from the final report. Jones, acting on this direct order, signed the <b>final</b> <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> and issued it without McGill's findings. McGill stated that he would take the matter to the appropriate oversight authorities. Immediately thereafter on June 30, 2014, DCAA Director Patrick Fitzgerald abruptly announced his retirement from Federal service (perhaps to avoid responsibility for the debacle), and DCAA Deputy Director Anita Bales (who had threatened McGill in January 2014) was appointed to replace him.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} expanded audit disclosures required by ISA 700 (UK and Ireland), The Independent Auditor?s Report on Financial Statements, on the communication value of the <b>audit</b> <b>report.</b> The new ISA 700 <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> is the first attempt by an auditing standard-setter to include expanded auditor disclosure in the <b>audit</b> <b>report.</b> The expanded disclosures significantly alter the pass/fail <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> model; however, it is not immediately clear that more <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> disclosures improve communication value. I address whether communication value improves in the post-ISA 700 by hand-collecting <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> content and demographic data from premium-listed London Stock Exchange and Irish Stock Exchange listed companies. Using content analysis measures, readability and tone, as proxies for communication value, I find that in the post-ISA 700 period: 1) <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> readability improves and 2) <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> tone changes with a higher occurrence of negative and uncertain words. I also evaluate analyst behavior {{in response to the}} ISA 700 <b>audit</b> <b>report.</b> I find that analyst following and analyst forecast dispersion decrease in the post-ISA 700 period.

40|$|<b>Audit</b> <b>reporting</b> lag {{continues}} to remain {{an issue of}} significant interest to regulators, financial statement users, public companies, and auditors. The SEC has recently acted to reduce the deadline for filing annual and quarterly financial statements. Such focus on <b>audit</b> <b>reporting</b> lag arises because, as noted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, relevance and reliability are the two primary qualities of accounting information; and, to be relevant, information has to be timely. ^ In my dissertation, I examine three {{issues related to the}} <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> lag. The first essay focuses on the association between <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> lag and the meeting or beating of earnings benchmarks. I do not find any association between <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> lag and just meeting or beating earnings benchmarks. However, I find that longer <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> lag is negatively associated with the probability of using discretionary accruals to meet or beat earnings benchmarks. We can infer from these results that audit effort, for which <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> lag is a proxy, reduces earnings management. ^ The second part of my dissertation examines the association between types of auditor changes and <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> lag. I find that the resignation of an auditor is associated longer <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> lag compared to the dismissal of an auditor. I also find a significant positive association between the disclosure of a reportable event and <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> lag. ^ The third part of my dissertation investigates the association between senior executive changes and <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> lag. I find that <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> lag is longer when client firms have a new CEO or CFO. Further, I find that <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> lag is longer when the new executive is someone from outside the firm.
