40|$|The {{timing of}} turnout is an {{important}} factor affecting the grazing management of dairy cows. However, its consequences are not well known in the short grazing season of northern Europe. Thus, the effect of the turnout date of dairy cows to pasture on sward regrowth, herbage mass production and milk production was studied in two experiments, 1) a <b>grazing</b> <b>trial</b> with 16 Holstein-Friesian dairy cows and 2) a plot trial where the treatments simulated the <b>grazing</b> <b>trial.</b> The treatments were early turnout (1 June) and normal turnout (6 June). Early turnout decreased the annual herbage mass (HM) production in the plot trial (P= 0, 005), but due to a higher average organic matter (OM) digestibility (P 0, 05). Although early turnout had no effect on milk yields it meant easier management of pastures...|$|E

40|$|Barbey {{larkspur}} (Delphinium barbeyi L. Huth) is a palatable {{poisonous plant}} that causes {{a large number}} of cattle deaths on mountain rangelands. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine whether or not cattle could be conditioned to avoid eating larkspur. Five heifers were conditioned to avoid eating larkspur by intraruminal infusion of lithium chloride whenever they consumed larkspur in a pen feeding trial. Five control hiefers were likewise infused with distilled water. Following the conditioning, the heifers were taken to mountain rangeland in central Utah and observed in 1986 and 1987. The non-averted heifers consumed larkspur throughout the 1986 field trial, while the averted heifers generally consumed little larkspur. The aversion from the previous summer persisted as the averted heifers refused to eat larkspur in the first <b>grazing</b> <b>trial</b> in 1987. During the second <b>grazing</b> <b>trial</b> in 1987, the averted heifers were placed in a pasture with non-averted heifers to determine if social influences would affect learned aversions.

40|$|Summary. A {{method for}} {{deriving}} {{the analysis of}} variance for an experiment is presented and applied to <b>grazing</b> <b>trials.</b> A special feature of <b>grazing</b> <b>trials,</b> specifically utilized by our method, is that they involve at least two randomizations: treatments are randomized to field units (for example paddocks or plots) and field units are randomized to animals. Randomization results in the confounding (‘mixing up’) of terms and our method includes separate terms {{in the analysis of}} variance table for confounded terms so that all sources of variability in the experiment have terms for them included in the table and the confounding between the sources of variability in the experiment is explicitly displayed in the table. This information is employed in determining the valid error terms and we will present examples that show how to ascertain these for effects of interest and hence which effects can be tested. In this it fulfils the same role as the contentious process of identifying the experimental unit. It will be demonstrated that the inclusion of separate terms for confounded terms results in improper replication in <b>grazing</b> <b>trials</b> being automatically signalled, and makes its ramifications clear...|$|R
40|$|A {{continuously}} <b>grazed</b> <b>trial</b> {{on natural}} and sown pastures under coconuts {{was reported by}} Watson & Whiteman (1981). This has been continued for another 3 years as a rotationally <b>grazed</b> <b>trial.</b> The paddocks were divided down the centre and three animals grazed for 28 days in one half and were transferred to the other half for 28 days. The same three stocking rates of 1. 5, 2. 5 and 3. 5 steers/ha were maintained. In the sown pasture paddocks Brachiaria decumbens and Brachiaria miliiformis were planted in rows from rooted cuttings, while Centrosema pubescens (centro) and Pueraria phaseoloides (puero) were sown, with seed at 4 and 3 kg/ha, respectively. Naturalized pastures were maintained by grazing at 2. 5 steers/ha during {{the establishment of the}} sown pasture. Light transmission was 62 %. Sown grasses were lost after 4 months from the start of rotational grazing. In the sown pastures puero became dominant. Animal live-weight gain (LWG) on puero was poor in the first 140 days of grazing in each year, but after this time it inoreased. Centro was the dominant species in the natural pasture of 2. 5 and 3. 5 steers/ha. However, there was little difference in yearly LWG except in year 3 when the 2. 5 steers/ha had higher gains in the natural (363 kg/ha) than in the sown pasture (250 kg/ha). The mean live-weight gain (kg/ha) in the first 2 years of the rotationally <b>grazed</b> <b>trial</b> (315 kg/ha) was lower than in the continuously <b>grazed</b> <b>trial</b> (364 kg/ha) at 3. 5 steers/ha. The time and efficiency of collecting fallen coconuts was lower at 1. 5 steers/ha in both pastures, but not different between 2. 5 and 3. 5 steers/ha. In continuous and rotational grazing there is little point in planting Brachiaria species. Productive pastures in plantations can be obtained by controiling weeds and sowing centro and puero into the naturalized Axonopus compressus and stocking at 2. 5 - 3. 0 steers/ha. Further research on other grasses such as Ischaemum aristatum and Stenotaphrum secundatum may lead to better grass persistence...|$|R

40|$|Efficiency of {{methionine}} hydroxy analog as {{a source}} of metabolizable methionine was examined in a growing and a <b>grazing</b> <b>trial.</b> In the growing trial, a basal diet of 44 % corncobs and 44 % sorghum silage (Sorhum bicolar (L.)) with 12 % supplement (DM basis) was fed individually to yearling crossbred steers. Steers were supplemented with urea, meat and bone meal (MBM), and MBM plus methionine hydroxy analog (MHA). Methionine hydroxy analog was added to MBM at gradually increasing levels up to 17 g/d/head. The <b>grazing</b> <b>trial</b> was conducted with yearling steers grazing smooth bromegrass (Brontus inermis Leyss.) from May 8 to August 1, 1997. Steers were individually supplemented daily with energy control, energy control + gradually increased MHA, and SoyPass (escape protein source) + MHA. Supplementing with MHA did not improve gains of steers in either trial. Methionine hydroxy analog did not affect feed intake in the growing trial, but supplement consumption was decreased at 17 g/d level in the <b>grazing</b> <b>trial.</b> Blood plasma methionine levels of treatments were not effected by MHA. Increased levels of MHA up to 17 g/d/head failed to provide an adequate level of metabolizable methionine in both trials. ^ Three experiments were conducted with ruminally cannulated steers to evaluate neutral detergent insoluble protein (NDIP) content of omasal samples as an escape protein estimation technique. In experiment 1, smooth brome hay escape protein (EP) values were determined with the NDIP technique and omasal sampling purine technique (OSPT). The escape protein values were not different as measured by these two techniques. In experiment 2, smooth bromegrass EP values were estimated in June and August, 1996. In situ and OSPT estimated similar EP values, but EP estimates from NDIP were lower. Experiment 3 was conducted from May through July, 1997. Omasal sampling purine technique estimated the highest EP values. In experiments 2 and 3, NDIP had better correlation with OSPT than with the in situ technique. Coefficients of variation of OSPT were higher than for NDIP. Escape protein content of forages can be estimated more precisely by NDIP. ...|$|E

40|$|Sugarcane is an {{important}} forage resource in sub-tropical and tropical areas as it is used during the winter or dry season when {{the growth rate of}} pastures is significantly reduced. The current research study assessed the effect of four vertical sections of sugarcane in a pen trial and the level of sugarcane utilization in a <b>grazing</b> <b>trial</b> on the ingestive behaviour and forage intake of two age groups of steers (1 and 2 years old). The pen trial was comprised of two simultaneous 4 × 4 balanced Latin square designs (one for each age group of animals) of four periods, four animals and four feeding treatments, which consisted of four equal vertical sections of sugarcane. Dry matter (DM) and digestible DM (DDM) intake per kilogram of metabolic weight declined gradually from top to bottom of the sugarcane, with {{no significant differences between the}} age groups of steers. This difference in intake was associated with a decline in intake of neutral detergent fibre (NDF) as a proportion of the liveweight of the animal and an increase of total chewing time per kilogram of DM or NDF from top to bottom of the sugarcane. It was concluded that the toughness of plant material played a significant role regulating intake, which was higher for the top sections of sugarcane. In the <b>grazing</b> <b>trial,</b> steers of both age groups grazed down sugarcane in three plots over 9 days. Steers grazed up to four distinctive grazing strata. Digestible DM intake (DDM intake) was high at low levels of horizontal utilization of the top grazing stratum but DDM intake started to decline sharply when this stratum was removed in 0 · 92 of paddock area (i. e. equivalent to 0 · 08 of the pasture area remaining un-grazed).

40|$|High-speed {{cinematography}} {{was used}} to observe adult female copepods feeding in pure cultures of roughly spherical algal cells ranging from 4. 5 to 22. 0 pm in diameter. Eucalanus pileatus and Puraculunus puruus detect and handle individual cells as small as 12 pm. Con-tinuous low amplitude movement of the second maxillae and combing of the appendages is used by E. pileutus to capture cells smaller than the 12 qm sensitivity threshold. Different energetic costs are probably associated with capturing small and large cells, and the proba-bility of copepods encountering large cells should be greatly increased due to remote detec-tion.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Digestibility {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} with dairy heifers to determine the digestibility of orchard grass, Dactylis glomerata, and also to evaluate the accuracy of various indicator techniques in pasture digestibility experiments. Chromic oxide {{was used as an}} external indicator to predict fecal dry matter output in three digestion trials. Cut grass was fed in one of the trials and corn silage in the other two. The internal indicators fecal nitrogen and protein of feed and feces were studied in two of the trials in which one conventional and one <b>grazing</b> <b>trial</b> were involved. The experimental animals consisted of six approximately two year old Holstein heifers and six Jersey heifers of the same ages. All animals were in about the fifth month of pregnancy. In the experiments, five grams of chromic oxide in gelatin capsules were fed to the animals twice a day at 7 A. M. and 4 P. M. Solka-floc, which is a pure cellulose material, was used as a carrier for chromic oxide. Fecal grab samples were collected from the rectum of grazing animals at 6 A. M. and 4 P. M. The chromic oxide recoveries in the feces of the stall fed animals fed orchard grass ranged from 98. 4 to 99. 2 percent, averaging 98. 8 percent. The average difference between the predicted and actual fecal dry matter output was 23. 1 g. This magnitude of difference yielded a 1. 01 percent error of prediction. However, chromic oxide recoveries for the silage trials were considerably lower, estimated as 79. 9 and 74. 9 percent for trials III and IV respectively. These low recoveries of chromic oxide resulted in a rather high error of prediction of fecal dry matter output with silages. The average errors of prediction for the grass forage dry matter intakes using fecal nitrogen and protein indigestibility techniques were found to be 1. 4 and - 6. 4 percent, respectively. The respective differences between the average actual and predicted forage dry matter intakes were 86. 1 and - 405. 2 g. Based on {{the results of this study}} the fecal nitrogen index technique appears to be superior to the protein indigestibility technique. The digestion coefficients of ether extracts were found to be higher for the conventional trial with pasture than for that of the <b>grazing</b> <b>trial,</b> while the reverse was true for the nitrogen free extracts. The average TDN and digestible energy values for orchard grass dry matter in the conventional trial were found to be 67. 1 and 68. 0 percent, respectively. The difference in estimations of the TDN and digestible energy values between total collection and fecal nitrogen technique was 0. 5 percent, which may be regarded as a reasonable error in digestibility experiments. The TDN and digestible energy values of the <b>grazing</b> <b>trial</b> were slightly higher than that of the conventional trial. The digestible energy determinations were highly correlated with the calculated TDN values.

40|$|Increased {{sediment}} {{and nutrient}} losses resulting from unsustainable grazing {{management in the}} Burdekin River catchment are major threats to water quality in the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon. To test the effects of grazing management on soil and nutrient loss, five 1 ha mini-catchments were established in 1999 under different grazing strategies on a sedimentary landscape near Charters Towers. Reference samples were also collected from watercourses in the Burdekin catchment during major flow events. Soil and nutrient loss were relatively low across all grazing strategies due {{to a combination of}} good cover, low slope and low rainfall intensities. Total soil loss varied from 3 to 20 kg ha− 1 per event while losses of N and P ranged from 10 to 1900 g ha− 1 and from 1 to 71 g ha− 1 per event respectively. Water quality of runoff was considered moderate across all strategies with relatively low levels of total suspended sediment (range: 8 – 1409 mg l− 1), total N (range: 101 – 4000 μg l− 1) and total P (range: 14 – 609 μg l− 1). However, treatment differences are likely to emerge with time as the impacts of the different grazing strategies on land condition become more apparent. Samples collected opportunistically from rivers and creeks during flow events displayed significantly higher levels of total suspended sediment (range: 10 – 6010 mg l− 1), total N (range: 650 – 6350 μg l− 1) and total P (range: 50 – 1500 μg l− 1) than those collected at the <b>grazing</b> <b>trial.</b> These differences can largely be attributed to variation in slope, geology and cover between the <b>grazing</b> <b>trial</b> and different catchments. In particular, watercourses draining hillier, grano-diorite landscapes with low cover had markedly higher sediment and nutrient loads compared to those draining flatter, sedimentary landscapes. These preliminary data suggest that on relatively flat, sedimentary landscapes, extensive cattle grazing is compatible with achieving water quality targets, provided high levels of ground cover are maintained. In contrast, sediment and nutrient loss under grazing on more erodable land types is cause for serious concern. Long-term empirical research and monitoring will be essential to quantify the impacts of changed land management on water quality in the spatially and temporally variable Burdekin River catchment...|$|E

In each study, groups of 10 FSGC were subjected to various parasite control methods in comparison with anthelmintic bolus treated animals (maximum control), and untreated, set-stocked cattle (minimum control). In companion ecological plot experiments, larval availability and overwintering survival on pasture were investigated.

The rotation group suffered a weight gain penalty of the same magnitude as the untreated cattle (30 kg), compared with the bolus treated animals. The results were explained by the high degree of overwintering survival of the pre-parasitic stages from early season contamination, which was substantiated in the parallel plot study.

40|$|Tanniferous forages, such as {{birdsfoot}} trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), are a potential {{control for the}} parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus (barber pole worm). Gastrointestinal parasites cause huge economic loss in small ruminant production. Tanniferous forages {{have been shown to}} reduce counts of parasite eggs in feces of small ruminants. Currently the tanniferous forage Lespedza cuneate L. is used in the southern United States in control of gastrointestinal nematodes of small ruminants. It is not a viable option in the Northeast due to insufficient winter hardiness. Birdsfoot trefoil is adapted to the Northeast and may be a viable option as a tanniferous forage for small ruminant production if populations exist that combine anthelmintic efficacy with strong agronomic performance. To address this need, I collected data on the agricultural performance of 51 Plant Introductory (PI) accessions and six commercial cultivars. In a three-year field study (2013, 2014, and 2015) I evaluated growth habit, winter hardiness, pest resistance, uniformity and vigor for 57 populations. In 2015, I tested 19 PI accessions and six commercial cultivars for grazing tolerance, regrowth, and uniformity and vigor in a rotationally grazed pasture trial. Birdsfoot trefoil accessions were chosen for the studies based on condensed tannin contents reported in the literature. Tannin content and in vitro anthelmintic efficacy were compared to agronomic characteristics. Growth habit was assessed using height/width ratios measured once each year. Winter hardiness was assessed as survival rate counted each spring. Birdsfoot trefoil is susceptible to potato leafhopper; damage by pests were visually evaluated.

Utilization of grasses, forbs and shrubs in the common use paddocks did not represent an average of the utilization by cattle and sheep each grazing alone. Cattle and sheep grazing together used more forage, especially snowberry, than calculated from single use averages. The diets of esophageally fistulated sheep were altered by the various grazing treatments. Diets consumed from previously ungrazed paddocks were higher in forbs, in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) and crude protein (CP) and lower in fiber than those diets consumed after paddocks had been grazed. Sheep consumed diets higher in IVOMD but lower in CP in paddocks previously grazed by sheep than where cattle had grazed alone or in commonly grazed paddocks. Sheep selected diets from the remaining herbaceous layer when grazing after sheep but ate mostly snowberry when grazing after cattle. Diets of sheep consumed subsequent to common use grazing were intermediate containing both snowberry and grasses. Sheep adjusted their feeding behavior as the <b>grazing</b> <b>trials</b> progressed by {{increasing the number of}} brief feeding station intervals. This trend was consistent regardless of whether sheep grazed alone or in common with cattle. However, when sheep grazed with cattle, longer feeding station station intervals persisted further into the <b>grazing</b> <b>trials</b> indicating that amounts of acceptable forage per feeding station were not reduced as quickly as when sheep grazed alone...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} if significant differences, in terms of grazing parameters, intake, animal performane and digestibility, existed between foggage of Cenchrus ciliaris cv. Molopo and Cenchrus ciliaris cv. Gayndah. A <b>grazing</b> <b>trial</b> as well as a partial digestibility study was done with sheep. The following parameters were used: grazing parameters (dry matter availability and structure of the grazing), qualitative and quantitative intake, animal production and partial digestiblity. The <b>grazing</b> <b>trial</b> was conducted over two years and further divided into two separate periods of utilisation, middle and late winter. The second trial was a partial digestibility experiment conducted during the second year. In terms of the production parameters of the two varieties: dry material production and sward length of C. ciliaris cv. Molopo was constantly higher than that of C. ciliaris cv. Gayndah. In the grazing experiment the quality of selected material did not differ between C. ciliaris cv. Gayndah and Molopo. Differences in most parameters were not significant. Experimental animals grazing Gayndah selected a diet with higher N- and NDF-concentrations, as opposed to animals grazing Molopo. The same trend continued during the second year but only for N-concentration. In terms of quantitative observations in the grazing experiment the intakes of the two varieties were high for the whole duration of the trial. Only during the "out"-phase of period 1 in 1991, animals on C. ciliaris cv. Molopo couldn’t maintain an intake to meet maintenance requirements. Experimental animals gained weight in the first period of grazing of the first year of the study but not during the rest of the trial. Although intake was high in the other periods, these intakes didn’t support growth or maintenance. This suggests that supplementation in the form of a lick could address possible deficiencies. In the partial digestion trial animals grazing C. ciliaris cv. Gayndah, as opposed to animals on cv. Molopo, selected a better quality material but quantitatively there were no significant differences. For both varieties the amount of organic material consumed wasn’t adequate to meet maintenance requirements. There were no significant differences in the partial digestibility of organic material or nitrogen. Animals on both varieties were in a negative nitrogen balance.

40|$|Tanniferous forages, such as {{birdsfoot}} trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), are a potential {{control for the}} parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus (barber pole worm). Gastrointestinal parasites cause huge economic loss in small ruminant production. Tanniferous forages {{have been shown to}} reduce counts of parasite eggs in feces of small ruminants. Currently the tanniferous forage Lespedza cuneate L. is used in the southern United States as a parasite control; it is not a viable option in the Northeast due to insufficient winter hardiness. Birdsfoot trefoil is adapted to the Northeast and may be a viable option as a tanniferous forage for small ruminant production if populations exist that combine anthelminthic efficacy with strong agronomic performance. To address this need, I collected data on the agricultural performance of 51 Plant Introductory (PI) accessions and six commercial cultivars. ^ In a three year field study (2013, 2014, and 2015) I evaluated growth habit, winter hardiness, pest resistance, uniformity and vigor for 57 populations. In 2015, I tested 19 PI accessions and six commercial cultivars for grazing tolerance, regrowth, and uniformity and vigor in a rotationally grazed pasture trial. Birdsfoot trefoil accessions were chosen for the studies based on condensed tannin contents reported in the literature. Tannin content and in vitro anthelminthic efficacy were compared to agronomic characteristics. ^ Growth habit was assessed using height/width ratios measured once each year. Winter hardiness was assessed as survival rate counted each spring. Birdsfoot trefoil is susceptible to potato leafhopper, damage by pests were visually evaluated. Quality was visually evaluated based on vigor and uniformity within each population. Vigor and uniformity was assessed yearly in the nursery plantings and immediately before each grazing event in the <b>grazing</b> <b>trial.</b> The eight week <b>grazing</b> <b>trial</b> allowed for two grazing events for each of the nine replications. Grazing tolerance and regrowth were measured weekly for each replication throughout the eight weeks of grazing. ^ Accessions and cultivars showed a significant difference in 2013 and 2015 for potato leaf hopper damage. There were also significant differences between accessions and cultivars for population uniformity and vigor and winter survival. A positive correlation was seen between plant survival and uniformity and vigor scores both in 2014 and 2015. PI 306182, ‘S 3149 ’, PI 262530, PI 262529, and PI 255305 were high in vigor and uniformity scores averaged across 2014 and 2015, 2013 scores were not significantly different. ‘Pardee’, ‘Leo’, ‘Empire’ and ‘Bull’ were high in uniformity and vigor scores for commercial cultivars averaged across 2014 and 2015. Growth habit was measured in height/width ratio and significant differences were seen in 2013 and 2015 but not 2014. Cluster analysis divided the 51 accessions and six commercial cultivars into 6 clusters. Clusters did not correlate with tannin levels or efficacy but cluster means allowed for evaluation of agronomic characteristics of similar populations. All six commercial cultivars were clustered together in cluster 1 (N= 18) with favorable agronomic characteristic results and high anthelmintic efficacy, with the exception of ‘Bruce’. PI 193725, PI 162425, PI 180171, PI 228286 and PI 325379 are promising accessions that were included in cluster 1, ranking high across agronomic characteristics and high anthelminthic efficacy. ^ In the rotational <b>grazing</b> <b>trial</b> regrowth and combined uniformity and vigor differed significantly between populations for both grazing events. Plant survival varied widely with a low of 56. 92 % for PI 232098 and a high of 95. 06 % for ‘Empire’. After agronomic characteristics were assessed, anthelmintic efficacy and condensed tannin content were compared. In vitro efficacy and condensed tannin content showed no correlation. High efficacy was positively correlated with plant survival rates and uniformity and vigor. Regrowth was independent of anthelminthic efficacy. ^ This research identifies commercial cultivars and PI accessions with potential for anthelmintic efficacy against H. contortus and successful agronomic performance as a legume forage in the northeastern U. S. PI 193725, PI 180171, PI 162425, PI 228286, PI 325379, ‘Empire’,’Norcen’,’Bull’, ‘Pardee’ and ‘Leo’ performed well agronomically and were efficacious in in vitro test against H. contortus. ...|$|E
40|$|A small-plot <b>grazing</b> <b>trial</b> was {{conducted}} to assess selection by oesophageal-fistulated steers of 5 shrubby legumes adapted to acid, low-fertility soils (Centrosema arenarium, Desmodium strigillosum, D. velutinum, Flemingia macrophylla, and Tadehagi triquetrum) and the herbaceous Centrosema acutifolium, associated with native pasture. There was marked variation between seasons in legume consumption: In the first dry season the proportion of legume in the diet selected by fistulated steers was greater than the legume available in the pastures for all shrub species. In the second dry season, when there was significant off-season rainfall, legume consumption in 4 of the 5 shrub species was lower and appreciably less than the legume on offer. In the wet season legume selection was low, except for the herbaceous C. acutifolium. The N concentrations for legume leaf were high in the dry and wet seasons but digestibility (IVDMD) was low, especially in F. macrophylla. It was concluded that the shrubby species tested have a potential as dry-season forage when associated with native pastures but that {{in the light of}} apparently low IVDMD this potential needs to be assessed in terms of animal production.

40|$|A {{simplified}} point method, the rod-point technique, {{for determining}} pasture botanical composition was assessed against 3 other popular methods. It was over 100 {{times faster than}} the traditional cut and hand-separate technique for the same level of precision. The presence of bias in the rod-point technique was assessed by comparing its estimates with those obtained by the hand-separation method. The pasture was classified into 8 botanical components, and the rod-point technique was significantly different from the hand-separated method in 3 instances, but in each case so were the Levy-point and the dry-weight-rank methods or the dry-weight-rank method alone. The rodpoint technique is most useful in large <b>grazing</b> <b>trials,</b> on-farm pasture monitoring, and pasture surveys.

40|$|CSIRO 2005 This paper {{reports the}} results of three {{cafeteria}} trials used to study palatability variation between the sex phenotypes of bladder saltbush (Atriplex vesicaria Heward ex Benth.). The results of the first trial show that Merino sheep preferentially grazed female samples compared to male ones, which supported earlier paddock-scale <b>grazing</b> <b>trials</b> and observations. In the second trial, the removal of male flower spikes led to increased consumption of male samples, suggesting that male flower spikes contain a grazing deterrent. The third trial showed that sheep were able to detect male material with or without spikes {{even when it was}} completely hidden within female plant material. In combination with observations made during the trials, these results suggest that there is a grazing deterrent present in male plants and that sheep use the male flower spike primarily as a visual cue when making grazing decisions...|$|R
