40|$|To {{test the}} {{significance}} of ultrafast protein folding signals (≪ 1 msec), we studied cytochrome c (Cyt c) and two Cyt c fragments with major C-terminal segments deleted. The fragments remain unfolded under all conditions and so {{could be used to}} define the unfolded baselines for protein fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) as a function of denaturant concentration. When diluted from high to low denaturant in kinetic folding experiments, the fragments readjust to their new baseline values in a “burst phase” within the mixing dead time. The fragment burst phase reflects a contraction of the polypeptide from a more extended unfolded condition at high denaturant to a more contracted unfolded condition in the poorer, low <b>denaturant</b> <b>solvent.</b> Holo Cyt c exhibits fluorescence and CD burst phase signals that are essentially identical to the fragment signals over the whole range of final denaturant concentrations, evidently reflecting the same solvent-dependent, relatively nonspecific contraction and not the formation of a specific folding intermediate. The significance of fast folding signals in Cyt c and other proteins is discussed in relation to the hypothesis of an initial rate-limiting search-nucleation-collapse step in protein folding [Sosnick, T.

Differential scanning calorimetry shows that oat globulin heated under conditions inducing gelation was not extensively denatured and exhibited highly cooperative transition characteristics.

5000|$|Streptavidin [...] is a 52.8 kDa protein {{purified}} {{from the}} bacterium Streptomyces avidinii. Streptavidin homo-tetramers have an extraordinarily high affinity for biotin (also known as vitamin B7 or vitamin H). With a dissociation constant (Kd) {{on the order}} of ≈10−14 mol/L, the binding of biotin to streptavidin is one of the strongest non-covalent interactions known in nature. Streptavidin is used extensively in molecular biology and bionanotechnology due to the streptavidin-biotin complex's resistance to organic <b>solvents,</b> <b>denaturants</b> (e.g. guanidinium chloride), detergents (e.g. SDS, Triton), proteolytic enzymes, and extremes of temperature and pH.|$|R
40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of banyan peroxidase purified from the latex of Ficus benghalensis has been solved at 1. 67 Å resolution by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing. The refined structure includes 306 amino acid residues, a heme and two calcium ions. The protein belongs to class III peroxidases {{and is the}} first one from plant latex. Extensive glycosylation was observed with N-linked glycans attached to seven asparagine residues. The enzyme is stable with respect to a wide pH range, temperature, chemical <b>denaturants</b> and organic <b>solvents,</b> probably {{as a result of its}} high glycosylation.

40|$|Hemoglobin is a {{promising}} drug carrier but lacks extensive investigation. The chemical conjugation of hemoglobin and drugs is costly and complex, {{so we have}} developed curcumin-loaded hemoglobin nanoparticles (CCM-Hb-NPs) via self-assembly for the first time. Using the acid-denaturing method, we avoid introducing <b>denaturants</b> and organic <b>solvents.</b> The nanoparticles are stable with uniform size. We have {{conducted a series of}} experiments to examine the interaction of hemoglobin and CCM, including hydrophobic characterization, SDS-PAGE. These experiments substantiate that this self-assembly process is mainly driven by hydrophobic forces. Our nanoparticles achieve much higher cell uptake efficiency and cytotoxicity than free CCM solution in vitro. The uptake inhibition experiments also demonstrate that our nanoparticles were incorporated via the classic clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. These results indicate that hemoglobin nanoparticles formed by self-assembly are {{a promising}} drug delivery system for cancer therapy...|$|R
40|$|Cross-linked enzyme {{aggregates}} of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL-CLEAs) from Rhodotorula glutinis were prepared. The {{effects of}} the type of aggregating agent, its concentration, and that of cross-linking agent were studied. PAL-CLEAs production was most effective using ammonium sulfate (40 % saturation), followed by cross-linking for 1 h with 0. 2 % (v/v) glutaraldehyde. Moreover, the storage and operational stability of the resulting PAL-CLEAs were also investigated. Compared to the free enzyme, the PAL-CLEAs exhibited the expected increased stability of the enzyme against various deactivating conditions such as pH, temperature, <b>denaturants,</b> and organic <b>solvents</b> and showed higher storage stability than its soluble counterpart. Additionally, the reusability of PAL-CLEAs with respect to the biotransformation of l-phenylalanine was evaluated. PAL-CLEAs could be recycled at least for 12 consecutive batch reactions without dramatic activity loss, which should dramatically increase the commercial potential of PAL for synthesis of l-phenylalanine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of immobilization of PAL as cross-linked enzyme aggregates...|$|R
40|$|The small all-β protein {{tendamistat}} folds and unfolds with two-state kinetics. We {{determined the}} volume changes {{associated with the}} folding process by performing kinetic and equilibrium measurements at variable pressure between 0. 1 and 100 MPa (1 to 1, 000 bar). GdmCl-induced equilibrium unfolding transitions reveal that {{the volume of the}} native state is increased by 41. 4 ± 2. 0 cm 3 /mol relative to the unfolded state. This value is virtually independent of denaturant concentration. The use of a high-pressure stopped-flow instrument enabled us to measure the activation volumes for the refolding (ΔVf 0 ‡) and unfolding reaction (ΔVu 0 ‡) over a broad range of GdmCl concentrations. The volume of the transition state is 60 % native-like (ΔVf 0 ‡ = 25. 0 ± 1. 2 cm 3 /mol) in the absence of <b>denaturant,</b> indicating partial <b>solvent</b> accessibility of the core residues. The volume of the transition state increases linearly with denaturant concentration and exceeds the volume of the native state above 6 M GdmCl. This result argues for a largely desolvated transition state with packing deficiencies at high denaturant concentrations and shows that the structure of the transition state depends strongly on the experimental conditions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} mutations, temperature, and solvent {{viscosity}} on the bimolecular association rate constant (kon) and dissociation rate constant (koff) {{of the complex}} (RNaseS*) formed by S-peptide analogues and folded S-protein are reported. An important advantage of this system is that both kon and koff may be measured under identical strongly native conditions, and Kd for the complex may be calculated from the ratio koff/kon (preceding article). The side chains of S-peptide residues His- 12 and Met- 13 contribute a large {{fraction of the total}} interface with S-protein. Changing these residues, either singly or in a double mutant, destabilizes RNaseS * by up to 6 orders of magnitude, but causes no more than a 3 -fold decrease in kon. Therefore, nativelike side-chain interactions between these residues and S-protein are not present in the transition state for folding. The absence of side-chain interactions in the transition state is surprising, since it has buried 55 % of the total surface area that is buried upon forming RNaseS*, as estimated from the denaturant dependences of kon and koff (preceding article). The temperature dependence of the refolding rate suggests that the transition state for complex formation is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions: 66 % of the change in heat capacity on forming RNaseS * occurs in the association reaction, consistent with the estimate of surface area burial from the <b>denaturant</b> studies. The <b>solvent</b> viscosity is varied to determine if the folding reaction is diffusion limited. Because kon, koff, and Kd all can be measured unde...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{aimed at}} {{improving}} our knowledge about the dynamic and structural properties of the unfolded states of proteins. Unstructured peptides were used as model systems to probe the structure and the dynamics of such states. Special emphasis {{was put on the}} influence of chemical denaturants as they are widely used in protein folding and stability studies. Triplet-triplet energy transfer (TTET) between xanthonic acid and naphthalene occurs in a diffusion-controlled manner and is thus well suited to measure absolute contact formation rate constants. Using TTET, intrachain loop closure dynamics in unstructured peptides were studied. We found that these dynamics are decelerated by the addition of the denaturants urea and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). Closer inspection revealed that this behaviour has contributions from two separate effects. First, <b>denaturants</b> increase <b>solvent</b> viscosity which impedes motions of the peptide chain. Secondly, denaturants bind to peptides and thereby further slow chain dynamics. Denaturant binding was found to be rather weak and transient. Urea and GdmCl mainly differ in their binding strength but not in their effect on chain dynamics once bound. This implies similar mechanisms of denaturation for these two compounds. In order to understand the effect of denaturants on the dynamics of unfolded polypeptide chains in more detail, we studied loop closure dynamics in a series of host-guest peptides. Different 'guest' amino acids were incorporated into common 'host' peptide contexts to assess their influence on peptide dynamics. For most peptides the effect of urea and GdmCl on intrachain contact formation was similar, indicating a common mechanism for denaturant action. These findings imply that chemical denaturants mainly interact with the polypeptide backbone. Lysine and arginine displayed significantly weaker interactions with GdmCl than all other residues, which is most likely due to charge-charge repulsion between the guanidinium cation and the basic amino acid sidechain. to obtain information abotu the structure of unfolded peptides and thus deepen our understanding of their behaviour, we employed fluorescence resonance energy treansfer (FRET) as a second optical spectroscopic technique. Using FRET, we studied the dynamics and dimensions of unstructured peptides at different GdmCl concentrations. The FRET measurements on these unstructured peptides were complicated by fast conformational rearrangements occuring during the experimental observation time. We developed a strategy to accurately account for these dynamics and to reliably analyze the experimental data. In separate experiments two chromophore pairs were used, which had largely different donor fluorescence lifetimes but were sensitive to the same distance range. Data obtained on both systems were globally evaluated and allowed to assess the influence of fast dynamics on the measured FRET signal. In principle, this strategy could also be applied to the study of other flexible systems. The analysis of the FRET data revealed that the end-to-end distance of unstructured peptides increases with increasing denaturant concentration. These results show that unstructured polypeptides can undergo significant changes in their dimensions upon changes of solvent composition. GdmCl further exerted a profound effect on the internal dynamics of peptide chains. High denaturant concentrations facilitated conformational rearrangements of the peptide chain, which was only partly offset by the concomitant increase of solvent viscosity. Taken together, these data confirmed that concentrated GdmCl solutions are good solvents for polypeptides and water is a bad one. Results from FRET and TTET measurements were found to be in good agreement. The denaturant-induced changes in intrachain contact formation rates, average dimensions and internal dynamics of the peptides were clearly correlated. Comparison of the results obtained with the two spectroscopic techniques further showed that the loop closure dynamics of long peptides can be sufficiently described by a theory for polymer dynamics by Szabo et al. All-atom simulations of sterically allowed peptide conformations were used to rationalize experimental observations on the behaviour of unstructured peptides. Comparison of simulation results with TTET experiments on proline-containing peptides provided an explanation for the different chain dynamics observed for cis- and trans-proline peptide isomers. Further, we compared the simulations to our FRET results. The average dimensions found for simulated peptide conformations closely coresponded to the dimensions experimentally observed for peptides in concentrated GdmCl solutions. Since in the simulations no intramolecular interactions except for excluded volume effects were considered, this could mean that binding of GdmCl to peptides largely abolishes intramolecular interactions. In the absence of these interactions the polypeptide chain would be more extended and able to udnergo faster conformational rearrangements. A last part of this thesis dealt with the folding reaction of the trimeric foldon domain from T 4 phage fibritin. Global evaluation of refolding experiments conducted at different protein concentrations enabled us to determine the minimal folding mechanism. Our data analysis provided an explanation for the high stability and fast assembly of the foldon trimer...|$|R
