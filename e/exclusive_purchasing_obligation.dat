As far as the customer foreclosure risks arising from single branding are concerned, it comes to the conclusion that Regulation 2790 / 1999 wrongly focuses on the market share of the seller and should concentrate on the market share of the acquirer. Symetrically, in so far as the input foreclosure risks arising from <b>exclusive</b> <b>purchasing</b> are concerned, Regulation 2790 / 1999 should focus on the market share of the seller.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines whether <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> data {{disclosed in}} the MD&A section of 10 -K filings {{are useful in}} predicting and understanding firm performance. The SEC defines a <b>purchase</b> <b>obligation</b> as an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods and services in the future. Consequently, by entering into <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations,</b> firms procure resources {{that will be used}} as production inputs, but they also have an obligation to make payments to their suppliers. Therefore, <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> have aspects of both assets and liabilities. When the SEC first introduced a rule requiring the disclosure of <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations,</b> the SEC's main concern was the liability aspect of <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations.</b> Thus, a firm's <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> were viewed by the SEC as having a potential negative impact on the firm's future liquidity. However, the level of a firm's <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> depends on the firm's degree of outsourcing, and the growth in a firm's <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> indicates that the firm expects to use more production resources in the future period. Therefore, an alternative view is that an increase in <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> leads to better future operating performance. Given these conflicting views, this dissertation examines the implications that annual change in a firm's <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> has for its future operating performance. The first essay provides background information on <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations.</b> We begin by explaining the details of the SEC rule which requires the disclosure of <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations.</b> Then, we describe data collection and sample formation procedure, and provide examples of contractual obligations disclosure. After that, we summarize the types and amount of <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> reported by our sample firms. Also, we document the strong persistence over time in the amount of <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> as well as the short-term nature of <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations.</b> Finally, we discuss the differences between purchaseobligations and on-balance-sheet assets, which lead to the main results of this work. The second essay examines the implications of annual changes in <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> for future operating performance and asset growth. We predict that firms enter into additional <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> when they expect an increase in demand for their products. Consistent with this prediction, we find annual change in <b>purchase</b> <b>obligation</b> is positively associated with future sales and earnings. The results of DuPont analysis shows that annual change in <b>purchase</b> <b>obligation</b> is positively associated with future asset turnover, but it is insignificantly associated with future profit margin. Additionally, we find that annual change in <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> is positively associated with both contemporaneous and future growth in on-balance-sheet assets, particularly fixed assets. These results suggest that the disclosure of <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> provides useful information to investors in predicting future performance and identifying growth stage. The last essay examines whether equity investors and analysts fully incorporate the information contained in the disclosure of <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations.</b> First, we find that annual change in <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> is positively associated with both contemporaneous and future annual stock returns. This suggests that although investors appear to appreciate the value-relevance of the information in <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> before 10 -Ks are filed, they do not fully incorporate the resulting implications of the information in determining stock prices. Second, we find that analyst forecast errors are positively correlated with annual change in <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> in the periods following the filing of a 10 -K. This suggests that analysts fail to fully incorporate the information in <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> when they forecast one-year-ahead earnings. This also suggests that the delayed stock price response to the information in <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> can be at least partially explained by analysts' inability to fully incorporate the information...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} disclosure of <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> in the MD&A section of 10 -K filings provides useful information to investors. Firms are predicted to enter into additional <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> when they expect an increase in demand for their products. As such, growth in <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> is predicted {{to be associated with}} higher future sales and earnings. The evidence is consistent with these predictions. This suggests that {{the disclosure of}} <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> is useful for predicting firm performance. Further tests document a positive contemporaneous relation between stock returns and the growth in <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations,</b> consistent with the information in <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> being value-relevant. However, the investor response appears to be incomplete. Results show that the change in <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> is positively associated with future abnormal stock returns. Additional tests provide evidence suggesting that analyst forecasts also do not appear to fully reflect the implications of the change in <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations.</b> *I would like to thank Patricia Dechow, who provided much inspiration and encouragement through this project.

40|$|The extant {{literature}} on operations and {{supply chain management}} suggest that recent developments in business environments where firms face extensive competition both locally and globally {{have given rise to}} supply chain uncertainties from both upstream and downstream firms. Such competition has led strategic managers to be more concerned about future business operations and production especially due to scarcity of resources. In response to these challenges, a priority for most strategic managers is to secure required levels of production inputs at optimal prices so that their firms face minimal supply chain disruptions by entering into legally binding contractual obligations with suppliers to ensure smooth future production operations. Such contractual obligations were promoted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2003, when it required non-small business issuers and non-smaller reporting entities in the United States to disclose <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> within a contractual obligations table in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of 10 -K filings. Despite such importance and regulatory requirement, there has been a paucity of research on business issues relating to <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations.</b> The purpose of this thesis is to investigate how managerial ability is associated with a firm’s commitment to <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations,</b> and how investors perceive such commitments as implied by the firm’s cost of equity. In order to secure required production inputs, managers need to forecast future product demands. Prior operations management studies suggest that such demand forecasting is complex and forecasts from quantitative models are often not sufficient to accurately predict product demands. A number of studies highlight the importance of managerial expert judgements to complement the quantitative models for better predicting future product demands. Recent studies argue that more able managers can better predict product demands. Hence, it is conceivable that managerial ability is associated with a firm’s commitment to <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations.</b> However, deducing from the investment efficiency studies, a firm’s commitment to <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> can involve forecast errors, which could be either due to honest failure to reliably predict demands or intentional over- or under-commitments due to opportunistic purposes. Based on recent managerial ability studies, more able managers are unlikely to fail to reliability predict product demands given their expert knowledge about the firm and industry trends and ability to synthesize information into forward looking information. On the contrary, a strand of managerial ability studies suggest that more able managers have a “dark side” because they have private information and can create information asymmetry between themselves and other stakeholders, allowing them to better conceal their opportunism. More able managers are likely to engage in opportunistic <b>purchase</b> <b>obligation</b> decisions to build empires and gain from higher compensation, such as equity incentives. On one hand, based on the strand of managerial ability studies which suggest that more able managers are efficient decision makers, it is plausible that managerial ability is associated with required levels of <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> necessary for increased future productions. On the other hand, managerial ability is also likely to be associated with unexpected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> consistent to the theory of “dark side” of managerial ability. Therefore, in this thesis, I disaggregate total <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> into expected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> predicted based on a firm’s underlying fundamental growth factors and unexpected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> to further investigate whether managerial ability is associated with expected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations,</b> and/or whether managerial ability is associated with unexpected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations.</b> The initial results show that managerial ability is positively associated with <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations.</b> Upon disaggregating <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> into expected and unexpected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations,</b> the results further show that managerial ability is positively associated with expected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations.</b> This result supports the view that more able managers commit to high levels of <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> to hedge against future price increase and inventory shortages. Next, consistent with the opportunistic perspective, the results provide evidence that managerial ability is positively associated with unexpected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations.</b> These results are robust to the use of propensity score matching analyses and change specifications. A number of additional analyses examine conditions where more able managers are more or less likely to commit to unexpected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations.</b> The additional analyses show that the positive association between managerial ability and unexpected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> is more profound for firms providing high equity incentive and it is less profound for firms with high managerial ownership. Given that unexpected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligation</b> is a concern if it is due to opportunism, further analyses examine and provide evidence that unexpected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> are detrimental to shareholders’ wealth by showing that it is negatively associated with inventory efficiency and future firm performance. Collectively, these results provide evidence that more able managers not only commit to <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> to hedge against price and inventory risks but also to build empires or to enjoy a quiet life, and gain from equity incentives. Since unexpected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> are detrimental to shareholders wealth irrespective of whether it arises due to forecast errors or managerial opportunism, this thesis further investigates how investors perceive such firm commitments, and whether the investors’ perception is less pronounced for firms with better quality financial reports. Specifically, this thesis next investigates the association between unexpected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> and the implied cost of equity capital. The results show that unexpected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> are positively associated with the implied cost of equity capital because it increases the firm’s idiosyncratic risk and analysts’ cash flow dispersion. The results also show that the positive association between unexpected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> and the implied cost of equity capital is less pronounced for firms with better quality financial reports. Additional analyses show that the association between unexpected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligation</b> and the implied cost of equity capital emanates from over-commitment to <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> and more from long than short horizon unexpected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations.</b> Moreover, the results provide evidence that unexpected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> are positively associated with the firm’s realized returns, interest rate and credit ratings. Further results from a propensity score matched sample analysis, change specification and lead-lag regressions imply that the main findings are robust to accounting for endogeneity. Based on the findings that unexpected <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> increase in managerial ability and that it is associated with lower future firm performance and higher cost of financing, the results from this thesis have implications for regulators and standard setters in addition to the contribution they make to the extant literature. Since investors perceive that <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> increase a firm’s business risks, regulators should consider requiring additional disclosures relating to <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations.</b> Similar to the disclosure requirements of major customers, regulators can potentially require disclosure of the names of major suppliers and the amount of <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations</b> from each major supplier. Such disclosures would enable investors to better assess the risks associated with <b>purchase</b> <b>obligations...</b>|$|R

When such memberships expire, the old rules return where a response is required in time to prevent shipping of full price movies without customer input. Customers are not reminded when those rules change. The customer also has access to a large variety of other movies, which are advertised by mail and online towards the customer. Only full price purchases deplete that minimum <b>purchase</b> <b>obligation.</b> <b>Purchases</b> are not cumulative, meaning that two movies bought at ten dollars each do not deplete the minimum list price movie purchases by one movie.

If any purchases have been made using Columbia House's point of sale device, either credit cards or debit cards linked to credit card accounts, then those accounts are automatically debited.

With peak power shortage as high as 15. 2 % (Source: Annual report FY 08, MoP) the nation needs to harness all forms of generation including renewables, which currently has a meager share of 8 % of the total generation in the country at present. Shooting price of crude oil reaching up to $ 135 (May 2008) per barrel along with increasing awareness and concerns about environment, the stage seems to be set for an increased mix of Renewable Energy (RE) into the overall energy requirement in the country. Keeping the concern for environment and energy security for the country in mind, government of India has been putting emphasis on promotion of renewable energy sources. Central and state government policies have always been instrumental in the propagation of capacity additions in renewable energy power. One of the main aims of these policies has been on increasing the private sector participation in this sector. In the pre-reform period, the state governments took policy decisions regarding financial incentives, buy-back tariff and other measures targeting investment in renewable energy. However, the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs) are now responsible for many of these tasks. SERCs {{have come up with a}} host of initiatives, inline with their functions laid down in the Electricity Act 2003, to increase the share of renewable energy inside their respective States. Despite the efforts of SERCs, large potential of renewable energy generation remains untapped.

The paper studies the impact of policies on deployment of wind potential across the States of India over two decades. Aggregate indices are computed for each of the seven wind resourceful States of India indicating attractiveness for installed capacity of wind energy. For computing the indices, four policies, Feed-in-Tariff, Renewable <b>Purchase</b> <b>Obligation,</b> Banking facility, and Wheeling charges are considered. Panel data techniques are then employed to investigate the impact of the policy differences on wind potential deployment over the 19 year period (1993 - 2012) after controlling for three State-specific factors. The controlling factors include per-capita income of the State, power deficit, and ratio of installed capacity of wind to geographic potential indicating unmet capacity. The results show that that policy index positively impacts wind deployment whether control variables are included or not. Moreover, the control factors like the per-capita income of the State and unmet capacity have positive influence over the investment in wind energy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
