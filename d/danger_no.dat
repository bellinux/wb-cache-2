2500|$|In {{the climax}} of his praise of Athens, Pericles declares: [...] "In short, I say that as a city we are the school of Hellas; while I doubt if the world can produce a man, who where he has only himself to depend upon, is equal to so many emergencies, and graced by so happy a {{versatility}} as the Athenian." [...] Finally, Pericles links his praise {{of the city to}} the dead Athenians for whom he is speaking, [...] "...for the Athens that I have celebrated is only what the heroism of these and their like have made her...none of these men allowed either wealth with its prospect of future enjoyment to unnerve his spirit, or poverty with its hope of a day of freedom and riches to tempt him to shrink from <b>danger.</b> <b>No,</b> holding that vengeance upon their enemies was more to be desired than any personal blessings, and reckoning this to be the most glorious of hazards, they joyfully determined to accept the risk... Thus, choosing to die resisting, rather than to live submitting, they fled only from dishonour..." [...] The conclusion seems inevitable: [...] "Therefore, having judged that to be happy means to be free, and to be free means to be brave, do not shy away from the risks of war". With the linkage of Athens' greatness complete, Pericles moves to addressing his audience.|$|E

60|$|Betty breathed freely again. Her {{knowledge}} of the East Side was small, and {{that there might be}} those there who acted independently of Mr. Jarvis, disdainful of his influence, did not occur to her.

60|$|They were slowly {{forced into}} this {{dangerous}} position. With breathless anxiety the Captain and crew watched the apparently gentle, but really tremendous grinding {{of the ice}} against the vessel's side.

We are not yet reduced to wandering among these free hills accompanied by a body guard. If such a one is necessary there he is, however.— Here, Brave—Brave——my noble Brave!” The huge mastif that has been already mentioned, appeared from his kennel, gaping and stretching himself with pampered laziness; but as his mistress again called: ...|$|E

60|$|I {{have told}} this passage, because it {{introduces}} what follows; that after I had had this discourse with him, I asked him, {{how far it}} was from our island to the shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost? He told me there was no <b>danger,</b> <b>no</b> canoes ever lost; but that after a little way out to sea, there was a current, and a wind always one way in the morning, {{the other in the}} afternoon.|$|E
60|$|It {{was those}} words of hers, coupled with that furtive yellow face still lurking at the window, {{which made me}} realise the imminence of my <b>danger.</b> <b>No</b> one in France had any reason to take an {{interest}} in me. If I were to pass away there was no one who could make inquiry--I was absolutely in his power. My memory told me what a ruthless and dangerous man it was with whom I had to deal.|$|E

"That is gospel truth, Tuscarora, if the Mingoes didn't {{know that}} they are near {{soldiers}}; but soldiers commonly think more of their dinner at a halt than of their wisdom and <b>danger.</b> <b>No,</b> no; let the boy pile on his logs, and smoke them well too; it will all be laid to the stupidity of some Scotch or Irish blunderer, who is thinking more of his oatmeal or his potatoes than of Indian sarcumventions or Indian rifles." ...|$|E

[...] "Are you afraid that if I begin work with the Artesian ray I shall become so {{interested}} in it that I shall forget our friends {{up there in the}} North? There is no <b>danger.</b> <b>No</b> matter what I might be doing with the ray, I can disconnect the batteries in an instant, lock up the lens-house, and in the next half-hour start for St. John's. Then I will go North if there is anything needed to be done there which human beings can do." ...|$|E
60|$|But as his counsel {{had been}} already once disregarded, he {{determined}} {{to let the}} first order for return come from the brothers, and he glanced for a moment from the sails and the sea to the two men sitting beside him. There was no thought of turning back there. Their lips were hard set, yet half smiling; their eyes wide open, as if {{to take in the}} tumultuous joy of the scene; their hands lay clenched on their knees. They had evidently no thought of <b>danger,</b> <b>no</b> thought of anything but deep, wild pleasure.|$|E

60|$|They {{who think}} so {{well of the}} French Constitution cannot be seriously alarmed by any {{progress}} made by its partisans.

Every person of a different opinion must be careless about security.|$|E
6000|$|... "Signore, {{we are in}} {{the hands}} of God. The pious Augustines, I make no doubt, are praying for all who are on the {{mountain}} at this moment; but there is not a minute to lose. I ask no more than that none lose sight of their companions, and that each exert his force to the utmost. We are not far from the House of Refuge, and should the storm increase to a tempest, as, to conceal the <b>danger</b> <b>no</b> longer, well may happen in this late month, we will seek its shelter for a few hours." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the dark}} John could risk the <b>danger</b> <b>no</b> longer. He let go the sword and sprang with a shout upon the bed.

Securing a fragment of the latter they proceeded once more to strike a light, with quaking hearts, while a horrible hissing and lashing was heard under the sofa. At last light was again thrown on the scene, and when the curtain was cautiously raised the cobra was seen to be writhing in its death-agonies--riddled with shot, and still pinned with the sword.|$|E
