40|$|With {{the recent}} {{introduction}} of the <b>ACCESS.</b> <b>bus</b> product, Digital has affirmed its commitment to open systems and thus to facilitating better solutions for interactive computing. This open desktop bus provides a simple, uniform way to link a desktop computer {{to as many as}} 14 low-speed I/O devices such as a keyboard, mouse, tablet, or three-dimensional tracker. <b>ACCESS.</b> <b>bus</b> features a 100 -kilobit-per-second maximum data rate, hardware arbitration, dynamic reconfiguration, a mature capabilities grammar to support generic device drivers, and off-the-shelf, low-cost IC microcontroller technology. [The BUS paper begins here. ] As the cost of personal interactive computing decreases, the range of applications and the need for specialized I/O devices is growing dramatically. Traditional personal computers were designed to accept {{only a small number of}} standard devices; adding devices beyond those originally envisioned usually requires specialized hardware or software. This custom interfacing is expensive for both vendors and users and thus limits the availability of new devices. <b>ACCESS.</b> <b>bus</b> provides a simple, uniform way to link a desktop computer to a number of low-speed I/O devices such as a keyboard, a mouse, a tablet, or a three-dimensional (3 -D) tracker. Designed from the beginning as an open desktop <b>bus,</b> <b>ACCESS.</b> <b>bus</b> facilitates cooperative solutions using equipment from different vendors. This paper describes the <b>ACCESS.</b> <b>bus</b> design and gives some insight into how the idea was adopted at Digital...|$|R
