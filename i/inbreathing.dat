60|$|Towards dawn he awoke. O what sweet music! His {{soul was}} all dewy wet. Over his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of light had passed.

A spirit filled him, pure as the purest water, sweet as dew, moving as music. But how faintly it was <b>inbreathed,</b> how passionlessly, as if the seraphim themselves were breathing upon him! His soul was waking slowly, fearing to awake wholly. It was that windless hour of dawn when madness wakes and strange plants open to {{the light and the}} moth flies forth silently.|$|R

When {{we came out of}} the Hills, I was troubled for thee and for other matters which I held in my heart. The boat of my soul lacked direction; I could not see into the Cause of Things. So I gave thee over to the virtuous woman altogether. I took no food. I drank no water. Still I saw not the Way. They pressed food upon me and cried at my shut door. So I removed myself to a hollow under a tree. I took no food. I took no water. I sat in meditation two days and two nights, abstracting my mind; <b>inbreathing</b> and outbreathing in the required manner ... Upon the second night--so great was my reward--the wise Soul loosed itself from the silly Body and went free. This I have never before attained, though I have stood on the threshold of it. Consider, for it is a marvel!' ...|$|E

Pursed lip breathing therapy will reduce muscle spasm breathing, clear the airway, relieve respiratory tract. Based on the analysis of data on the effect of pursed lip Breathing Exercise to decreased levels of breathlessness using Wilcoxon test control group P= 0. 014, group P= 0. 002, indicating that the control and treatment groups equally - the same effect of reducing the level of asphyxiation but more good treatment group as more significant. While the results of the data analysis results obtained using the Mann Whitney Rank 12. 60 Mean control group and the treatment group Mean Rank of 18. 40 with a value P < 0. 043, which means there are different effect between the control group and the treatment group. The conclusions of this study are no influence of the control group and the treatment group to reduce shortness of breath but better treatment group...|$|E
