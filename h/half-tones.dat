25|$|Effects not {{generally}} associated with ballpoint pens can be achieved. Traditional pen-and-ink {{techniques such as}} stippling and cross-hatching {{can be used to}} create <b>half-tones</b> or the illusion of form and volume. For artists whose interests necessitate precision line-work, ballpoints are an obvious attraction; ballpoint pens allow for sharp lines not as effectively executed using a brush. Finely applied, the resulting imagery has been mistaken for airbrushed artwork and photography, causing reactions of disbelief which ballpoint artist Lennie Mace refers to as the Wow Factor.|$|E
500|$|The delicate, romantic {{prints of}} Suzuki Harunobu (1725–1770) were amongst {{the first to}} realize {{expressive}} and complex colour designs, printed with up to a dozen separate blocks to handle the different colours and <b>half-tones.</b> [...] His restrained, graceful prints invoked the classicism of waka poetry and Yamato-e painting. [...] The prolific Harunobu was the dominant ukiyo-e artist of his time. [...] The success of Harunobu's colourful nishiki-e from 1765 on led to a steep decline in demand for the limited palettes of benizuri-e and urushi-e, as well as hand-coloured prints.|$|E
40|$|PVC and PET-G (Glycol {{modified}} polyethylene terephthalate) {{have the}} highest consumption in the shrink sleeve market due to its high shrink abilities and cost effectiveness. The reproductions of fine tone details on these films are challenging as the occurrence of graininess and image-noise results in print defect such as print <b>half-tone</b> mottle. The presence of print <b>half-tone</b> mottle is visually disturbing leading to wastage of ink, substrate and time. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the effect of gravure process parameters viz. ink viscosity, press speed, impression hardness and line screen and develop statistical model for print <b>half-tone</b> mottle in shrink films. The base line for print <b>half-tone</b> mottle was determined by conducting production runs on press with a defined set of process parameters and the target was set to minimize it from the baseline. The <b>half-tone</b> area was scanned and processed through SFDA algorithm to calculate print <b>half-tone</b> mottle. The design of experiments (DOE) was generated for above-mentioned process parameters and was analysed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) to find the significant factor affecting the print <b>half-tone</b> mottle. The analysis revealed line screen, viscosity and hardness as significant factors in minimizing print <b>half-tone</b> mottle. The results showed minimization of print <b>half-tone</b> mottle by 28 % for both PVC and PET-G films. Furthermore, regression model was developed and validated for print <b>half-tone</b> mottle and a correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0. 8696 and 0. 879 was achieved for PET-G and PVC respectively. The proposed model is helpful in determining the impact of gravure process parameters and prediction of print <b>half-tone</b> mottle in shrink films...|$|R
40|$|<b>Half-toning</b> is {{a method}} to print multi-tone images using only {{two-tone}} colors. Such methods are commonly used in publishing and computer printers. There are several kinds of <b>half-toning</b> processing where inverse <b>half-toning</b> {{is a method}} to reconstruct a multi-tone image from a half-toned image. This invention introduced a new method, the fast edge-preserving filtering, which adopts low-complexity algorithm to perform inverse <b>half-toning.</b> By way of this method, an inverse half-toned image is generated by directly filtering the <b>half-tone</b> image in an iterative manner. This low computational complexity but high image quality method made resizing, rotating and processing of images simple, easy and quick {{even if you are}} using lower-end models of computers or computer accessories like printers and scanners. In addition, the new inverse <b>half-toning</b> method can be used as an edge preserving filter in applications such restoration, noise-reduction, enhancement, retouching of images, old archival images, remote sensing images, and medical images...|$|R
40|$|Gray-scale {{images can}} be {{displayed}} on binary display devices using {{a process known as}} <b>half-toning</b> where gray intensities are approximated by different distributions of black and white pixels. There is a significant number of methods with which these binary or half-toned approximations can be generated. Most of the available methods can be categorized as either a threshold-matrix <b>half-toning</b> method or as an error-diffusion <b>half-toning</b> method. The threshold-matrix <b>half-toning</b> methods are fast and simple to implement and they can be used with or without an increase in resolution. The binary approximation of each gray-scale value is computed independently. Images half-toned with threshold matrices often exhibit quantization bands in areas of the image where a smooth intensity change occurs. Error-diffusion <b>half-toning</b> methods approximate the image one segment at a time. Any error resulting from a segment's approximation is propagated to unprocessed segments. In this paper we present some results from our current research focused on producing <b>half-toning</b> methods that are hybrids of threshold-matrix and error-diffusion <b>half-toning.</b> In particular, we introduce three hybrid methods: Threshold-matrix with error-diffusion, Variable shape threshold-matrix, and Variable threshold with error-diffusion. Each of these techniques brings together aspects from both threshold-matrix and error-diffusion <b>half-toning</b> methods. The common feature of these three methods is that they remove the quantization bands introduced by the use of small threshold matrices. ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{traditional}} engraving, {{which is}} a purely linear medium, the impression of <b>half-tones</b> was created by making many very thin parallel lines, a technique called hatching. When two sets of parallel-line hatchings intersected each other for higher density, the resulting pattern was known as cross-hatching. Patterns of dots were also used in a technique called stippling, first used around 1505 by Giulio Campagnola. Claude Mellan {{was one of many}} 17th-century engravers with a very well-developed technique of using parallel lines of varying thickness (known as the [...] "swelling line") to give subtle effects of tone (as was Goltzius) – see picture below. One famous example is his Sudarium of Saint Veronica (1649), an engraving of the face of Jesus made from a single spiraling line that starts at the tip of Jesus's nose.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sounds of}} scales vary {{depending}} on the placement of tones. Modern Western scales use the placement of whole tones, such as C to D on a modern piano keyboard, and half tones, such as C to C-sharp, but not quarter-tones ("in the cracks" [...] on a modern keyboard) at all. This limit on tone types creates relatively few kinds of scales in modern Western music compared to that of the Greeks, who used the placement of whole-tones, <b>half-tones,</b> and even quarter-tones (or still smaller intervals) to develop a large repertoire of scales, each with a unique ethos. The Greek concepts of scales (including the names) found its way into later Roman music and then the European Middle Ages to the extent that one can find references to, for example, a [...] "Lydian church mode", although name is simply a historical reference with no relationship to the original Greek sound or ethos.|$|E

40|$|<b>Half-toning</b> is {{the process}} by which gray-scale images are {{approximated}} with sets of black and white pixels. The process works because our eyes perceive a local average, thus <b>half-toning</b> seeks to approximate the local average. Ideally this approximation should be accomplished without introducing `undesirable' artifacts. In many situations the stylized display of images is desired. Often this stylized display is accomplished by the addition of semi-structured artifacts. In current applications the designer processes the image using tools provided by some image processing package. The resulting image is then half-toned and printed. <b>Half-toning</b> these processed images can reduce the visual impact of the special effects that have been introduced in the image. In this paper we show that the processes of controlled artifact introduction and <b>half-toning</b> can successfully be combined. By combining these two processes we ensure that the printed image is what the designer intended. We present a bri [...] ...|$|R

60|$|Down {{the winding}} path which curved among the rocks the little train of baggage-camels was daintily picking its way. They came mincing and undulating along, turning their heads slowly {{from side to}} side with the air of a {{self-conscious}} woman. In front rode the three Berberee body-servants upon donkeys, and behind walked the Arab camel-boys.

The dazzling light without, the subdued <b>half-tones</b> within, the green palm-fronds outlined against the deep blue sky, the flitting, silent-footed Arab servants, the crackling of sticks, the reek of a lighting fire, the placid supercilious heads of the camels, they all come back in their dreams to those who have known them.|$|E
60|$|We {{discussed}} this, {{first of}} all, under {{the lee of}} a wet deck-house in mid-Atlantic; man after man cutting {{in and out of}} the talk as he sucked at his damp tobacco. The passengers were nearly all unmixed Canadian, mostly born in the Maritime Provinces, where their fathers speak of 'Canada' as Sussex speaks of 'England,' but scattered about their businesses throughout the wide Dominion. They were at ease, too, among themselves, with that pleasant intimacy that stamps every branch of Our Family and every boat that it uses on its homeward way. A Cape liner is all the sub-Continent from the Equator to Simon's Town; an Orient boat is Australasian throughout, and a C.P.R. steamer cannot be confused with anything except Canada. It is a pity one may not be born in four places at once, and then one would understand the <b>half-tones</b> and asides, and the allusions of all our Family life without waste of precious time. These big men, smoking in the drizzle, had hope in their eyes, belief in their tongues, and strength in their hearts. I used to think miserably of other boats at the South end of this ocean--a quarter full of people deprived of these things. A young man kindly explained to me how Canada had suffered through what he called 'the Imperial connection'; how she had been diversely bedevilled by English statesmen for political reasons. He did not know his luck, nor would he believe me when I tried to point it out; but a nice man in a plaid (who knew South Africa) lurched round the corner and fell on him with facts and imagery which astonished the patriotic young mind. The plaid finished his outburst with the uncontradicted statement that the English were mad. All our talks ended on that note.|$|E
