30|$|Attunement to noticing {{patterns}} and structure {{is a key}} part of the ‘looking for structure’ strand. Attention to juxtaposing examples in ways that <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> to variations, invariances, and connections between examples has been argued as one way to develop this attunement (Watson and Mason 2006). Careful sequencing can <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> to ideas like ‘doing and undoing’ and the regularities within sets of related examples in ways that <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> to underlying mathematical structure.|$|R
