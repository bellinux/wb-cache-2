40|$|Previous work on {{reference}} in dialogue {{has shown that}} speakers adapt to the concepts {{that were used in}} earlier references during an interaction (such as orientation when a <b>dialogue</b> <b>partner</b> describes a chair as “the chair seen from the front”), even if these concepts are generally dispreferred. Here, we investigate to what extent it matters whether speakers interact with an artificial or a human <b>dialogue</b> <b>partner</b> (Study 1) and whether this adaptation indeed takes place at the conceptual level (Study 2). For Study 1 participants interacted either with a computer or with a human confederate and it was found that participants adapt in similar ways and just as much to a human <b>dialogue</b> <b>partner</b> as to a computer. Study 2 used a cross-language interaction paradigm, in which bilingual participants listened to English descriptions after which they had to refer in Dutch (thereby reducing the possibilities for lexical and syntactic alignment). The results showed that even with crosslinguistic prime-target pairings, participants aligned with the attributes used by their <b>dialogue</b> <b>partner,</b> providing further evidence for alignment at the conceptual level...|$|R

40|$|The ASEAN and its <b>dialogue</b> <b>partner</b> {{countries}} {{agreed to}} reduce trade barriers {{in the services}} sector, {{one of which is}} sea transport services. The {{purpose of this study is}} to estimate the equivalent tax of non-tariff barriers in the sea transport services. Besides that, this study is going to analyze the economic impacts of the regulatory barriers elimination in the sea transport services of ASEAN and its <b>dialogue</b> <b>partner</b> countries. Using the gravity model, it can be identified that trade barriers of sea transport services sector of ASEAN and <b>dialogue</b> <b>partner</b> countries are still relatively high. Additionally, by adopting IC-IRTS model in Global CGE Model (GTAP), the simulation results show consistent results with the theory of pro-competitive effects. The greater gain from trade is obtained in the CGE model assuming IC-IRTS compared to PC-CRTS.
