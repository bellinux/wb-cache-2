40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} process of policy {{formulation}} in Malawi with particular reference to police reform between 1995 and 2000. After {{a long period of}} one party government, Malawi from 1994 made the transition to a multiparty parliamentary democracy. The Malawi Police is an important institution in the new regime. Within the frameworks of <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> theory <b>and</b> stakeholder theory the paper explores the way in which various interests influenced the reform of the police organization and management from 1995 to 2000. Reviews were undertaken of the literature on the policy process and the scholarly writing on <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> stakeholder theory. Field research was carried out in the public documentation available in Malawi and by face to face interviews with senior officials and other participants in the reform process. The findings confirmed the utility of both <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> stakeholder theory in explaining how public policies are formulated...|$|R

25|$|Fire {{policy in}} the United States {{involves}} the federal government, individual state governments, tribal governments, <b>interest</b> <b>groups,</b> <b>and</b> the general public.

Although human safety is still the number one priority in fire management, new US government objectives include a long-term view of ecosystems. The newest policy allows managers to gauge the relative values of private property and resources in particular situations and to set their priorities accordingly.|$|E
25|$|Implementation of the {{proposed}} settlement hinged on popular acceptance, but the Rhodesian government consistently refused to submit it to a universal referendum.
