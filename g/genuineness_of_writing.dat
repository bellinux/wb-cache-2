60|$|Tertullian, I think, says he {{had seen}} the {{autograph}} copies of some of the apostles' writings. The truth is, the ancient Church was not guided by the mere fact <b>of</b> the <b>genuineness</b> <b>of</b> a <b>writing</b> in pronouncing it canonical;-- its catholicity was the test applied to it. I have not the smallest doubt that the Epistle of Barnabas is genuine; but it is not catholic; it is full of the [Greek: gnosis], though of the most simple and pleasing sort. I think the same of Hermas. The Church would never admit either into the canon, although the Alexandrians always read the Epistle of Barnabas in their churches for three hundred years together. It was upwards of three centuries before the Epistle to the Hebrews was admitted, and this on account of its [Greek: gnosis]; at length, by help of the venerable prefix of St. Paul's name, its admirers, happily for us, succeeded.|$|R
