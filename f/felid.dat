5|$|A 2017 study {{indicates}} that juveniles were born with a robust build similar to the adults. Comparison of the bones of juvenile S. fatalis specimens from La Brea {{with those of the}} contemporaneous American lion revealed that the two cats shared a similar growth curve. <b>Felid</b> forelimb development during ontogeny (changes during growth) has remained tightly constrained. The curve is similar to that for modern cats such as tigers and cougars, but shifts more towards the robust direction of the axes than is seen in modern felids.|$|E

40|$|In {{a survey}} of gynaecological lesions in female zoo <b>felids</b> {{conducted}} {{to determine if the}} widely used progestin contraceptive melengestrol acetate (MGA) had adverse effects, numerous leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas were detected. This current study aimed to characterize the morphologic features of these tumours, determine their prevalence, and assess if MGA was a risk factor for their genesis. Genital tracts from 219 zoo <b>felids</b> representing 23 species kept in various zoological parks in US and received between 1988 and 1995 were evaluated. The median age of all study animals was 143 months. 98 <b>felids</b> were treated with MGA for at least 6 months and 121 <b>felids</b> had no history of exposure to progestins or other contraceptives (control). Leiomyomas were detected in 24 % of the <b>felids.</b> Leiomyomas were often multiple and occurred in the myometrium, ovary or adjacent broad ligament. The risk of developing leiomyomas increased with age, but MGA treatment or parity had no effect. Five other <b>felids</b> had leiomyosarcomas. Leiomyosarcomas were distinguished from poorly demarcated leiomyomas by the presence of local invasion, metastasis and cellular atypia, but necrosis and mitotic rate were not distinguishing criteria. Four of five <b>felids</b> with leiomyosarcomas had been treated with MGA. These results indicate that leiomyomas are common spontaneous lesions in the genital tracts of zoo <b>felids</b> and their genesis is not linked to MGA exposure. Whether progression to malignancy is promoted by MGA warrants further investigation. ID: 6594; Accession Number: 20023075032. Publication Type: Journal Article. Language: English.

5|$|In Eurasia, red foxes may be preyed upon by leopards, caracals and Eurasian lynxes. The lynxes chase red foxes {{into deep}} snow, where their longer legs and larger paws {{give them an}} {{advantage}} over foxes, especially when {{the depth of the}} snow exceeds one metre. In the Velikoluki district in Russia, red foxes are absent or are seen only occasionally where lynxes establish permanent territories. Researchers consider lynxes to represent considerably less danger to red foxes than wolves do. North American <b>felid</b> predators of red foxes include cougars, Canadian lynxes and bobcats. Occasionally, large raptors such as Eurasian eagle owls will prey on young foxes, while golden eagles have been known to kill adults.|$|E
5|$|Smilodon is an extinct genus of machairodont <b>felid.</b> It {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous prehistoric mammals, and the best known saber-toothed cat. Although {{commonly}} known as the saber-toothed tiger, it was not closely related to the tiger or other modern cats. Smilodon lived in the Americas during the Pleistocene epoch (2.5 mya–10,000 years ago). The genus was named in 1842, based on fossils from Brazil. Three species are recognized today: S.gracilis, S.fatalis and S.populator. The two latter species were probably descended from S.gracilis, which itself probably evolved from Megantereon. The largest collection of Smilodon fossils has been obtained from the Rancho La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, California.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians {{associated}} many gods {{who took}} <b>felid</b> form with the sun, and many lioness deities, like Sekhmet, Menhit, and Tefnut, were equated with the Eye. Bastet was depicted {{as both a}} domestic cat and a lioness, and with these two forms she could represent both the peaceful and violent aspects of the Eye. Yet another goddess of the solar Eye was Mut, the consort of the god Amun, who was associated with Ra. Mut was first called the Eye of Ra in the late New Kingdom, and the aspects of her character that {{were related to the}} Eye grew increasingly prominent over time. Mut, too, could appear in both leonine and cat form.|$|E
50|$|Cats are obligate carnivores, {{requiring}} {{a diet of}} meat and organs to survive. Aside from the lion, wild <b>felids</b> are generally solitary; feral domestic cats do, however, form colonies. Cheetah males are also known to live and hunt in groups. <b>Felids</b> are generally secretive animals, often nocturnal, and live in relatively inaccessible habitats. Around three-quarters of cat species live in forested terrain, and they are generally agile climbers. However, <b>felids</b> {{may be found in}} almost any environment, with some species being native to mountainous terrain or deserts.|$|R

5|$|The bobcat prey base {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} other midsized predators of a similar ecological niche. Research in Maine has shown little evidence of competitive relationships between the bobcat and coyote or red fox; separation distances and territory overlap appeared random among simultaneously monitored animals. However, other studies have found bobcat populations may decrease in areas with high coyote populations, with the more social inclination of the canid giving them a possible competitive advantage. With the Canada lynx, however, the interspecific relationship affects distribution patterns; competitive exclusion by the bobcat {{is likely to have}} prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its <b>felid</b> relative.|$|E
5|$|The last {{confirmed}} {{death of}} an Anatolian leopard, {{closely related to the}} Persian (Caucasian) leopard and native to the western regions of Anatolia, took place in the Bağözü village of the Beypazarı district in Ankara Province on 17 January 1974. The Persian (Caucasian) leopard is still found in very small numbers in the northeastern and southeastern regions of Turkey. The Caspian tiger is an extinct tiger subspecies (closely related to the Siberian tiger) which lived in the easternmost regions of Turkey until {{the latter half of the}} 20th century, with the last confirmed death in Uludere, February 1970. The Eurasian lynx and the European wildcat are other <b>felid</b> species which are currently found in the forests of Turkey.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to dogs, cats have not undergone major changes during the domestication process, as {{the form and}} behavior of the domestic cat is not radically {{different from those of}} wildcats and domestic cats are perfectly capable of surviving in the wild. Fully domesticated house cats often interbreed with feral F. catus populations, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat. This limited evolution during domestication means that hybridisation can occur with many other felids, notably the Asian leopard cat. Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have predisposed them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play and relatively high intelligence. Several small <b>felid</b> species may have an inborn tendency towards tameness.|$|E

5|$|Being in {{the genus}} Acinonyx, the {{morphology}} of the cheetah differs notably {{from the big}} cats (genus Panthera). The face and the jaw are unusually shortened and the sagittal crest is poorly developed, possibly to reduce weight and enhance speed. In fact, the skull resembles that of the smaller cats. Another point of similarity to the small cats is the long and flexible spine, {{in contrast to the}} stiff and short one of other large felids. A 2001 study of <b>felid</b> morphology stated that the truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in the cheetah at a relatively younger age than other felids could be a major reason for the peculiar morphology of the cheetah. Interestingly, the cheetah appears to show convergent evolution with canids in morphology as well as behaviour. For example, the cheetah has a relatively long snout, long legs and deep chest, tough foot pads and blunt, semi-retractable claws; moreover, its hunting behaviour resembles that of canids. In the 2001 study, it was observed that the claws of cheetah have features intermediate between those of felids and the wolf. In the Puma lineage, the cheetah's skull morphology {{is similar to that of}} the pumaboth have short, wide skullswhile that of the jaguarundi is different.|$|E
5|$|Bobcats {{generally}} begin breeding {{by their}} second summer, though females may start {{as early as}} their first year. Sperm production begins each year by September or October, and the male is fertile into the summer. A dominant male travels with a female and mates with her several times, generally from winter until early spring; this varies by location, but most mating takes place during February and March. The pair may undertake {{a number of different}} behaviors, including bumping, chasing, and ambushing. Other males may be in attendance, but remain uninvolved. Once the male recognizes the female is receptive, he grasps her in the typical <b>felid</b> neck grip and mates with her. The female may later go on to mate with other males, and males generally mate with several females. During courtship, the otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud screams, hisses, or other sounds. Research in Texas has suggested establishing a home range is necessary for breeding; studied animals with no set range had no identified offspring. The female has an estrous cycle of 44 days, with the estrus lasting five to ten days. Bobcats remain reproductively active throughout their lives.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain of}} Smilodon had sulcal {{patterns}} similar to modern cats, which suggests an increased {{complexity of the}} regions that control the sense of hearing, sight, and coordination of the limbs. <b>Felid</b> saber-tooths in general had relatively small eyes that were not as forward-facing as those of modern cats, which have good binocular vision to help them move in trees. Smilodon was likely an ambush predator that concealed itself in dense vegetation, as its limb proportions were similar to modern forest dwelling cats, and its short tail would not have helped it balance while running. Unlike its ancestor Megantereon, which was at least partially scansorial and therefore able to climb trees, Smilodon was probably completely terrestrial due to its greater weight and lack of climbing adaptations. The heel bone of Smilodon was fairly long, which suggests {{it was a good}} jumper. Its well-developed flexor and extensor muscles in its forearms probably enabled it to pull down, and securely hold down, large prey. Analysis of the cross-sections of S.fatalis humeri indicated that they were strengthened by cortical thickening {{to such an extent that}} they would have been able to sustain greater loading than those of extant big cats, or of the extinct American lion. The thickening of S.fatalis femurs was within the range of extant felids. Its canines were fragile and could not have bitten into bone; due to the risk of breaking, these cats had to subdue and restrain their prey with their powerful forelimbs before they could use their canine teeth, and likely used quick slashing or stabbing bites rather than the slow, suffocating bites typically used by modern cats. On rare occasion as evidenced by fossils, Smilodon was willing to risk biting into bone with its canines. This may have been focused more towards competition such as other Smilodon or potential threats such as other carnivores than on prey.|$|E

25|$|Snow leopards are unusual among large cats in {{that they}} have a {{well-defined}} birth peak. They usually mate in late winter, marked by a noticeable increase in marking and calling. Snow leopards have a gestation period of 90–100 days, so the cubs are born between April and June. Oestrus typically lasts from five to eight days, and males tend not to seek out another partner after mating, probably because the short mating season does not allow sufficient time.

25|$|The thick fur is reddish-{{brown on}} top of the head, dark roan brown on the body, and mottled white on the underbelly. The face is lighter in color than the body, and the muzzle and chin are white. Two {{prominent}} buff whitish streaks run {{on either side of the}} nose between the eyes. The ears are rounded. The eyes are unusually far forward and close together, compared with other cats, giving the <b>felid</b> improved stereoscopic vision. The teeth are adapted for gripping onto slippery prey, and the jaws are relatively powerful. These features help the flat-headed cat to catch and retain aquatic prey, to which it is at least as well adapted as the fishing cat. Legs are fairly short. Claws are retractable, but the covering sheaths are so reduced in size that about two-thirds of the claws are left protruding.|$|E

40|$|Currently two {{protein sources}} (beef or horse) {{comprise}} {{the majority of}} raw meat diet formulations for exotic carnivores in zoological institutions. Pork-based diets have traditionally not been fed to managed exotic carnivores, primarily because of microbial and pathogenic concerns, and nutrient digestibility of pork has not been evaluated in captive exotic carnivores, such as <b>felids.</b> Additionally, commercially prepared raw meat diets, while nutritionally complete, rarely meet nonnutritive requirements of cats, such as locating, capturing, and killing prey as well as psychological aspects related to the feeding process, and oral health needs. The pork industry currently sends many by-products to rendering that {{have the potential to}} be used in raw carnivore diets or as environmental enrichment. The overall objectives of this research were to evaluate a raw, pork-based diet for small and large captive exotic <b>felids,</b> including diet compositional analyses, fecal scores, palatability, and microbial loads. Additionally, the use of pork by-products as environmental enrichment devices for large captive exotic <b>felids</b> was evaluated. Our first aim was to determine apparent total tract macronutrient digestibility, fecal scores, and palatability of a pork-based diet compared with standard zoological carnivore diets formulated with either horse or beef, in large captive exotic <b>felids.</b> Our second aim was to determine if a pork-based diet had similar apparent total tract macronutrient digestibility and fecal scores as standard zoological carnivore diets formulated with either horse or beef, in small exotic <b>felids,</b> and evaluate microbial populations in raw diets. Our third aim was to evaluate 11 pork by-products for macronutrient and mineral composition and determine if a pig head would be a biologically relevant environmental enrichment device for large <b>felids</b> kept in a zoological setting. In general, a raw pork-based diet was well digested and utilized by large and small captive exotic <b>felids.</b> All raw meat diets used in these studies were highly digestible, and the pork-based diet was similarly or more digested compared to other protein sources. Fecal scores were healthy when <b>felids</b> were fed the pork-based diet and the diet was determined palatable for the tested cats. The use of raw pork by-products also provides opportunity as potential environmental enrichment. In our first aim, we demonstrated that a raw pork-based diet was highly digestible in large exotic <b>felids</b> by using four raw meat dietary treatments: one horse-based (Horse), two beef-based (B 1, B 2), and one pork-based diet (Pork).
