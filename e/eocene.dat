5|$|Three {{stages of}} tectonic {{activity}} have been noted; Late Cretaceous, Paleocene-Early <b>Eocene</b> and Middle <b>Eocene</b> to Oligocene.|$|E
5|$|Adapids {{were most}} {{commonly}} found in Europe, although the oldest specimens (Adapoides from middle <b>Eocene</b> China) indicate that they most likely evolved in Asia and immigrated. They died out in Europe during the Grande Coupure, part of a significant extinction event {{at the end of}} the <b>Eocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Notharctids, {{which most}} closely resembled some of Madagascar's lemurs, come from Europe and North America. The European branch is often {{referred}} to as cercamoniines. The North American branch thrived during the <b>Eocene,</b> but did not survive into the Oligocene. Like the adapids, the European branch were also extinct by the end of the <b>Eocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sirenians, the sea cows, became aquatic around 40 {{million years}} ago. The first {{appearance}} of sirenians in {{the fossil record}} was during the early <b>Eocene,</b> and by the late <b>Eocene,</b> sirenians had significantly diversified. Inhabitants of rivers, estuaries, and nearshore marine waters, {{they were able to}} spread rapidly. The most primitive sirenian, †Prorastomus, was found in Jamaica, unlike other marine mammals which originated from the Old World (such as cetaceans). The first known quadrupedal sirenian was †Pezosiren from the early <b>Eocene.</b> The earliest known sea cows, of the families †Prorastomidae and †Protosirenidae, were both confined to the <b>Eocene,</b> and were pig-sized, four-legged, amphibious creatures. The first members of Dugongidae appeared {{by the end of the}} <b>Eocene.</b> At this point, sea cows were fully aquatic.|$|E
5|$|The Melittidae {{are known}} from Palaeomacropis eocenicus in the Early <b>Eocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sirenia, {{commonly}} referred to as sea cows or sirenians, are an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters. The Sirenia currently comprise the families Dugongidae (the dugong) and Trichechidae (manatees) with a total of four species. The Protosirenidae (<b>Eocene</b> sirenians) and Prorastomidae (terrestrial sirenians) families are extinct. Sirenians are classified in the clade Paenungulata, alongside the elephants and the hyraxes, and evolved in the <b>Eocene</b> 50 million years ago. The Dugongidae diverged from the Trichechidae in the late <b>Eocene</b> or early Oligocene.|$|E
5|$|Afrasia {{has only}} {{been found in the}} <b>Eocene</b> Pondaung Formation of central Myanmar, a rock unit which has been dated to about 37 million years ago using magnetostratigraphy and fission track dating. This places it {{at the end of the}} Bartonian stage, near the Middle–Late <b>Eocene</b> boundary. Although many tons of sediments in the area have been {{screened}} for fossils, Afrasia is still known only from four teeth, suggesting that it was a rare species.|$|E
5|$|Ancestral {{rhinoceroses}} {{are held}} to have first diverged from other perissodactyls in the Early <b>Eocene.</b> Mitochondrial DNA comparison suggests the ancestors of modern rhinos split from the ancestors of Equidae around 50 million years ago. The extant family, the Rhinocerotidae, {{first appeared in the}} Late <b>Eocene</b> in Eurasia, and the ancestors of the extant rhino species dispersed from Asia beginning in the Miocene.|$|E
5|$|Dating to the <b>Eocene</b> epoch over 50 mya, Chriacus and Thryptacodon—two {{types of}} arctocyonids (primitive placental mammals)—also possessed an {{independently}} evolved toothcomb.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>Eocene,</b> rodents {{began to}} diversify. Beavers {{appeared}} in North America {{in the late}} <b>Eocene</b> before spreading to Eurasia. Late in the <b>Eocene,</b> hystricognaths invaded Africa, most probably having originated in Asia at least 39.5 million years ago. From Africa, fossil evidence shows that some hystricognaths (caviomorphs) , which was an isolated continent at the time, evidently making use of ocean currents to cross the Atlantic on floating debris. Caviomorphs had arrived in South America by 41 million years ago (implying a date at least {{as early as this}} for hystricognaths in Africa), and had reached the Greater Antilles by the early Oligocene, suggesting that they must have dispersed rapidly across South America.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{a fossil}} sea-turtle from the <b>Eocene</b> epoch of New Zealand was named {{in honour of}} him Psephophorus terrypratchetti by the {{palaeontologist}} Richard Köhler.|$|E
5|$|In a 1998 review, {{primatologist}} Marc Godinot recognized Sivaladapidae as {{a separate}} family within the Adapiformes, and this classification has been followed since then. Several genera in addition to Indraloris and Sivaladapis are now allocated to Sivaladapidae, which is known from the <b>Eocene</b> through the Miocene of China, Thailand, Myanmar, India, and Pakistan. Sivaladapids are notable for including by far the youngest adapiforms; {{members of this group}} are otherwise known mostly from the <b>Eocene,</b> but several sivaladapids occurred during the Miocene.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} by Brown & Kempf in 1968 {{based on two}} workers collected in a Berlese sample of humus in El Salvador. Due to morphological similarities, they considered it a very primitive ant {{and placed it in}} what was then a myrmicine tribe, the Agroecomyrmecini, together with ants known from Early <b>Eocene</b> Baltic amber (Agroecomyrmex) and late <b>Eocene</b> Florissant shale (Eulithomyrmex).|$|E
5|$|The Megachilidae {{are known}} from trace fossils (characteristic leaf cuttings) from the Middle <b>Eocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Until {{discoveries of}} three 40-million-year-old fossil lorisoids (Karanisia, Saharagalago, and Wadilemur) in the El Fayum {{deposits}} of Egypt between 1997 and 2005, the oldest known lemuriforms {{had come from}} the early Miocene (~20mya) of Kenya and Uganda. These newer finds demonstrate that lemuriform primates were present during the middle <b>Eocene</b> in Afro-Arabia and that the lemuriform lineage and all other strepsirrhine taxa had diverged before then. Djebelemur from Tunisia dates to the late early or early middle <b>Eocene</b> (52 to 46mya) and has been considered a cercamoniine, but also may have been a stem lemuriform. Azibiids from Algeria date to roughly the same time and may be a sister group of the djebelemurids. Together with Plesiopithecus from the late <b>Eocene</b> Egypt, the three may qualify as the stem lemuriforms from Africa.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic {{activity}} {{has occurred in}} parts of Iran since the Cretaceous period. During the <b>Eocene</b> and Oligocene epochs, volcanic activity reached its maximum, with thick pyroclastic layers being deposited in central Iran and the Alborz mountains. The area around Taftan volcano belongs to a tectonic zone which is variously {{referred to as the}} Sistan suture or the Zabul-Baloch zone. There, after a previous episode of rifting and subsequent formation of an ocean, the Neh and Lut tectonic blocks collided during the <b>Eocene</b> epoch after a subduction episode that commenced in the Maastrichtian age.|$|E
5|$|Anoplotherium is an extinct mammal {{from the}} <b>Eocene</b> to Oligocene epochs, first found near Paris. Hawkins's models draw on Owen's {{speculation}} about its camel-like appearance. (They are now {{thought to be}} related to hippopotamus and pigs). Three models were made, forming a small herd.|$|E
5|$|During the Paleocene and <b>Eocene,</b> most mammals {{remained}} small (under 20 kg). Cooling {{climate in}} the Oligocene and Miocene, {{and the expansion}} of grasslands favored the evolution of larger mammalian species.|$|E
5|$|Fossil Prionomyrmecini ants {{existed in}} Europe during the <b>Eocene</b> and Late Oligocene. Cesare Baroni Urbani {{collected}} Prionomyrmex janzeni in Baltic amber from Kaliningrad, Russia and Prionomyrmex wappleri in Germany. Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr collected Prionomyrmex longiceps in Baltic amber from the <b>Eocene,</b> but {{the exact location}} of its discovery is unclear, due to the lost type material. P. longiceps were an arboreal nesting species, living in trees instead of the ground. William Morton Wheeler assumed this due to its long legs, sharp claws and elongated mandibles. Prionomyrmex may have preferred a jungle habitat at low elevations.|$|E
5|$|Lemuriforms are {{currently}} {{thought to have}} evolved in Africa, and the earliest known strepsirrhine primates from Africa are azibiids from the early <b>Eocene,</b> which likely descended from a very early colonization of the Afro-Arabian land mass in the Paleocene (66 to 55mya). Stem lemuriforms, including Djebelemur and 'Anchomomys' milleri, {{have been found in}} Africa and date from 50 to 48 mya and were very distinct from European adapiforms. However, they lack a toothcomb. These stem lemuriforms suggest an early common ancestry with cercamoniines from outside of Europe. Based on large, procumbent lower teeth, Plesiopithecus, a fossil primate found in late <b>Eocene</b> deposits at the Fayum Depression in Egypt, is thought to be most closely related to lemuriforms. Together, Djebelemur, ‘Anchomomys’ milleri, and Plesiopithecus are considered to be sister taxa (the closest relatives) of lemuriform primates.|$|E
5|$|Siletzia is {{the massive}} {{formation}} of early to middle <b>Eocene</b> epoch marine basalts and interbedded sediments in the forearc of the Cascadia subduction zone; this forms the basement rock under western Oregon and Washington {{and the southern}} tip of Vancouver Island. It is now fragmented into the Siletz and Crescent terranes.|$|E
5|$|Sirenians first {{appeared}} in the fossil record in the Early <b>Eocene</b> and significantly diversified throughout the epoch. They inhabited rivers, estuaries, and nearshore marine waters. Sirenians, unlike other marine mammals such as cetaceans, lived in the New World. The earliest aquatic sirenian discovered is Prorastomus which dates back to 40 million years ago, and the first known sirenian, the quadruped Pezosiren, lived 50 million years ago. Prorastomidae and Protosirenidae, the earliest sirenian families, consisted of pig-like amphibious creatures who died {{out at the end of}} the <b>Eocene.</b> When the Dugongidae appeared at this time, sirenians had evolved the characteristics of modern variety, including an aquatic streamlined body with flipper-like front legs with no hind limbs, and a powerful tail with horizontal caudal fins which uses an up-and-down motion to move them through the water.|$|E
5|$|The Altiplano {{started to}} form during the <b>Eocene,</b> when {{subduction}} of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate caused compression along the plate margin. Strong volcanism and tectonic uplift occurred between 15and 20million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The South Lhasa terrane {{experienced}} metamorphism and magmatism in the Early Cenozoic (55–45 Ma) and metamorphism in the Late <b>Eocene</b> (40–30 Ma), presumably due to {{the collision}} between the continents of India and Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|The Vespidae {{include the}} extinct genus Palaeovespa, seven species {{of which are}} known from the <b>Eocene</b> rocks of the Florissant fossil beds of Colorado and from fossilised Baltic amber in Europe. Also found in Baltic amber are crown wasps of the genus Electrostephanus.|$|E
5|$|The {{first true}} {{primates}} (euprimates) {{do not appear}} in the fossil record until the early <b>Eocene</b> (~55mya), at which point they radiated across the Northern Hemisphere during a brief period of rapid global warming known as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. These first primates included Cantius, Donrussellia, Altanius, and Teilhardina on the northern continents, as well as the more questionable (and fragmentary) fossil Altiatlasius from Paleocene Africa. These earliest fossil primates are often divided into two groups, adapiforms (sometimes called adapids, or adapoids) and omomyiforms (or omomyids—suspected relatives of tarsiers). Both appeared suddenly in the fossil record without transitional forms to indicate ancestry, and both groups were rich in diversity and were widespread throughout the <b>Eocene.</b> Although few fossils of extant primate groups—lemuriforms, tarsiers, or simians—are known from the Early to Middle <b>Eocene,</b> evidence from genetics and newer fossil finds suggest they may have been present during this early adaptive radiation. The divergence between strepsirrhines, simians, and tarsiers likely followed almost immediately after primates first evolved.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} is deficient, {{but it is}} likely that these poorly defined {{subspecies}} diverged as global temperature rose over the last 10,000 years or so. Only one record of the species possibly dates back to the late <b>Eocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between adapiform and lemuriform primates {{has not been}} clearly demonstrated, so the position of adapiforms as a paraphyletic stem group is questionable. Both molecular clock data and new fossil finds suggest that the lemuriform divergence from the other primates and the subsequent lemur-lorisoid split both predate the appearance of adapiforms in the early <b>Eocene.</b> New calibration methods may reconcile the discrepancies between the molecular clock and the fossil record, favoring more recent divergence dates. The fossil record suggests that the strepsirrhine adapiforms and the haplorhine omomyiforms had been evolving independently before the early <b>Eocene,</b> although their most basal members share enough dental similarities {{to suggest that they}} diverged during the Paleocene (66–55mya).|$|E
5|$|A {{cladistic}} {{study of}} the skeletal and bone morphology of the classical Pelecaniformes and relatives found that the frigatebirds formed a clade with Limnofregata. Birds of the two genera have 15 cervical vertebrae, unlike almost all other Ciconiiformes, Suliformes and Pelecaniformes, which have 17. The age of Limnofregata indicates that these lineages had separated by the <b>Eocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ancestors of {{contemporary}} salamanders were likely able to disperse and migrate into habitats of the Rocky Mountains and surrounding areas by the <b>Eocene.</b> Mesic forests {{were established in}} western North America by the mid <b>Eocene</b> and attained their contemporary range distributions by the early Pliocene. The temperate forest valleys and montane environments of these time periods (Paleogene to Neogene) would have provided the physiographic and ecological features supporting analogs {{of contemporary}} Ambystoma macrodactylum habitats. The Cascade Range rose during the mid Pliocene and created a rain shadow effect causing the xerification of the Columbia Basin and also altered ranges of temperate mesic ecosystems at higher elevations. The rise of the Cascades causing the xerification of the Columbia Basin is a major biogeographic feature of western North America that divided many species, including A.macrodactylum, into coastal and inland lineages.|$|E
5|$|Dermotherium major {{was found}} in a lignite pit known as Wai Lek in Krabi Province, southwestern Thailand. It is part of the Krabi Basin fauna, which {{contains}} at least 40 mammalian genera, mostly artiodactyls but also including some primates, such as Siamopithecus, Wailekia, and Muangthanhinius. This fauna has been dated to about 33 to 35 million years ago, during the Late <b>Eocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|LACM 149371 was {{described}} in 2004 by Francisco Goin and colleagues, who tentatively interpreted the tooth as a left last upper molar. Although they saw similarities with South American ungulates, some early rodents, and multituberculates, they believed the tooth was most likely of a gondwanathere. Among gondwanatheres—a small and poorly known group otherwise known from the Cretaceous through <b>Eocene</b> {{of some of the}} southern continents (Gondwana)—they thought the Cretaceous Argentinian Ferugliotherium to be the most similar.|$|E
5|$|Molecular clock {{estimates}} {{indicate that}} lemurs and the lorisoids diverged in Africa during the Paleocene, approximately 62mya. Between 47 and 54mya, lemurs dispersed to Madagascar by rafting. In isolation, the lemurs diversified {{and filled the}} niches often filled by monkeys and apes today. In Africa, the lorises and galagos diverged during the <b>Eocene,</b> approximately 40mya. Unlike the lemurs in Madagascar, {{they have had to}} compete with monkeys and apes, as well as other mammals.|$|E
5|$|Ocepeia is {{from the}} Paleocene of Morocco's Ouled Abdoun Basin, {{although}} its fossils were initially thought to be earliest Ypresian (early <b>Eocene)</b> in age. That age has been revised, {{and now it is}} known that O. daouiensis comes from the same bone bed that is dated to the Selandian age of the Paleocene (59-60 MYA), which also yields Eritherium, Abdounodus, and Lahimia. O. grandis is slightly younger (more recent) in age, occurring in the Thanetian bone bed of the same area. Its larger size and younger age suggest it is in the same evolutionary lineage as O. daouiensis. The area of western Morocco during the late Cretaceous through the <b>Eocene</b> consisted of warm, shallow inland seas, where the ancient Tethys Ocean met the Atlantic Ocean, and during which phosphate deposits and associated fossils accumulated over some 25 million years.|$|E
5|$|Other {{groups also}} {{underwent}} major radiations. Based on molecular sequencing and fossil dating, Neoaves appeared to radiate after the K–Pg boundary. They even produced giant, flightless forms, {{such as the}} herbivorous Gastornis and Dromornithidae, and the predatory Phorusrhacidae. The extinction of Cretaceous lizards and snakes {{may have led to}} the radiation of modern groups such as iguanas, monitor lizards, and boas. On land, giant boid and enormous madtsoiid snakes appeared, and in the seas, giant sea snakes radiated. Teleost fish diversified explosively, filling the niches left vacant by the extinction. Groups appearing in the Paleocene and <b>Eocene</b> include billfish, tunas, eels, and flatfish. Major changes are also seen in Paleogene insect communities. Many groups of ants were present in the Cretaceous, but in the <b>Eocene</b> ants became dominant and diverse, with larger colonies. Butterflies diversified as well, perhaps {{to take the place of}} leaf-eating insects wiped out by the extinction. The advanced mound-building termites, Termitidae, also appear to have risen in importance.|$|E
5|$|The Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes is an {{area between}} 14–28° {{southern}} latitude where volcanic activity dates to the <b>Eocene.</b> Ignimbritic activity has occurred over the whole area, particularly north of 25° southern latitude where the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex is situated. Ignimbrites are primarily rhyolite and rhyodacite and subordinate shoshonite. The more southern ignimbrites are felsic and have a low crystal content. With {{the exception of the}} Luingo caldera and Cerro Galán, most volcanism south of 25° southern latitude is of low volume. After a phase of pyroclastic activity in the Antofalla area during the <b>Eocene,</b> a number of volcanoes formed from calc-alkaline magmas during the Miocene. Changes in subduction geometry including the removal of continental crust from the boundary 8-3 mya have caused a thickening of the crust as well as an eastward shift of the volcanic front. Huaynaputina volcano in Peru is part of the Central Volcanic Zone and had a major eruption in 1600.|$|E
