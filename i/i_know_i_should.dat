500|$|A {{muscle strain}} forced Mackin {{to miss a}} {{pre-season}} friendly against Shrewsbury Town in July 2008 and he returned to pre-season training later that month. He was shown a red card after picking up two yellow cards in his first appearance of 2008–09, which was Wrexham's first match in the Conference Premier, as they beat Stevenage Borough 5–0 at home on 9 August 2008. On reflection, Mackin said [...] "As for the second yellow I felt the ball was there to be won and I thought that's what I did. Looking back now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have stayed on my feet". He was handed a one-match suspension and returned in a 1–1 draw away to Rushden & Diamonds on 17 August 2008. Mackin scored his first goal {{of the season with}} a 25-yard shot against Grays Athletic, which was Wrexham's only goal in a 2–1 away defeat on 20 September 2008. Despite starting the season as a regular in the team, he found opportunities hard to come by after the arrival of Dean Saunders as manager.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't wonder. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> go mad if {{my mother}} {{turned out to be}} {{somebody}} else's wife." [...] And then they both sauntered away.|$|E
6000|$|I know, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not see [...] The season's glorious show, [...] Nor would its {{brightness}} shine for me; [...] Nor its wild music flow; ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should!</b> But {{think of}} those fearful Pyrenees, and the bandits that infest them--and all the {{valuables}} we carry with us!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah,--I wish <b>I</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{have said}} that I had seen every {{shilling}} that came into the house; but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> nothing of this cheque,--whence it came." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{attachments}} are so. It is electricity--spontaneity. It is instantaneous. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{love you}} from the moment I saw you. Do you not feel it yourself?" ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. MARCHMONT. Olivia, I have {{a curious}} feeling of {{absolute}} faintness. I think I should like some supper very much. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> like some supper.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{professor}} of what? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> ask of where; {{but that would}} only elicit {{the name of a}} college, which would convey no real information to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'God {{help me to}} {{keep the}} resolution! It {{is the one thing}} that I care for, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have begun the first day I was away from you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{began to}} weep. [...] "There! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> hurt your feelings. But you mustn't mind what I say. I beg your pardon! I {{take it all}} back--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh weh! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have a cruel husband who----Joy! I {{think the}} maid is prowling about {{and trying to}} listen. 'Shhh! The story Laura {{will get out of}} her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|She started, {{shaking her}} head saucily. ''Twas so slow there, and so broiling,' she called back, 'and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> only drift down to meet you, and could put in when I pleased.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But he can," [...] {{said the}} father. [...] "At any rate {{you can find}} out whether he will name a price. I'd go myself, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> quarrel with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I know it, I know it," [...] cried Hester, {{wringing}} her hands, [...] "but {{even if it}} were now, I {{could not}} help it. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> do it again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{glad you}} took it, Robin; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have grown idle if I had had it. Depend on it, 'twas {{that gave me}} this year of grace and the Bishop's prize.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had a sort {{of longing}} to come into those natural {{relations}} which <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> find here. Over there I had only, as I may say, artificial relations. Don't you see the difference?" ...|$|R
60|$|My dear Haydon--We {{are very}} unlucky--I should have stopped to dine with you, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{not have been}} able to leave you in time for my plaguy sore throat; which is getting well.|$|R
6000|$|... "Acquaintances; {{only a few}} friends. I can't help regretting those I {{must leave}} behind. In fact"--he spoke impulsively, expressing a thought that had haunted him--"it would be a relief if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> come back again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I quite {{agree with}} you there. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> drown myself or put a bullet through my head if I could not show {{ordinary}} courage {{with a lot of}} ladies going on working quietly round me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should go}} away, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> go away," [...] he said, half under his breath. [...] "And I can. I am no weakling. Because I {{have failed to}} remain away once, is no reason that I shall fail again." ...|$|E
60|$|SOAMES. I {{admit that}} I should {{probably}} not do so. I should perhaps be wrong not {{to steal the}} turnip: I cant defend my reluctance to do so; but I think I should not do so. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not do so.|$|E
60|$|How nice of him {{to bring}} them! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> like Mrs. Allardyce, just because Aunt Martha didn't. We had a {{delightful}} stroll. I never thought of the time until Mr. Shelmardine said it was four o'clock.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} been certain of this; {{that has been the}} sole reason, of my absence. Had <b>I</b> <b>known</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be welcome, nothing would have induced me to suffer Grace to pass the last six sad, sad, months by herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|I too {{had been}} struck from the float for ever held in solution, I too had [...] {{received}} identity by my Body; That <b>I</b> was, <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> was of my body--and what <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be, <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> [...] be of my body.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't help it; I'm {{perfectly}} {{fascinated by}} those foolish things, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have bought some; {{so it is}} well that I've lost my money, perhaps," [...] answered Daisy, looking so innocently penitent and so frankly disappointed that Mr. Vaughn said kindly:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{they really}} like it, {{there is no}} objection. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> like very much to have my brother here quizzing me; but {{you know very well}} there are two sorts of such fun, and one that is only sport to the {{stronger}} side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's no use {{talking about}} it,' Alice said, {{looking up at}} the house and pretending it was arguing with her. 'I'm NOT going in again yet. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have to get through the Looking-glass again--back into the old room--and there'd be an end of all my adventures!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not now! No, never!' {{said the}} boy hugging him almost to choking. 'That naughty Ben Kader said they had sold you for a slave, and you were going away; but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> find you--you are not a slave!--you are not black--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Henri, friend, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> find ye," [...] said Dick, {{cutting the}} thongs that bound him. [...] "Get up if ye can, we haven't {{much time to}} lose, an' mayhap we'll have to fight afore we're done wi' the Red-skins. Can ye rise?" ...|$|R
60|$|Of course I {{decided to}} leave Montreal as soon as I could. But I couldn't get away within a week, {{and it was a}} very {{unpleasant}} one. Alicia treated me with icy indifference, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never be reinstated in her good graces.|$|R
6000|$|... "How very silly of you, John! What {{made you}} indorse for them? Now {{that is too}} bad; {{it just makes me}} {{perfectly}} miserable to think of such things. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not have done so; but I don't see why you need pay it. It is their business, anyhow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's {{the good}} of troubling about a man like Sheen? He never was any good, and this doesn't make him very much worse. Besides, he'll {{probably}} be sick enough on his own account. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should,</b> if I'd done it. And, anyway, we don't know that he did do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like your}} own captain better than ever, Richard," [...] whispered Dolly, while Mr. Orchardson {{relieved}} himself of his quid {{over the other}} side; [...] "how commanding he is! Were I to take passage in the Betsy, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{be in love with}} him long before we got to Norfolk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. Some day <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{meet the}} only girl I could {{possibly}} love, and then I would pour out upon her the stored-up devotion of a lifetime, lay an unblemished heart at her feet, fold {{her in my arms}} and say 'At last!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> soon {{be right}} again. I {{have not made}} the {{acquaintance}} of gout {{for more than two}} years, and it generally goes off the second night. Well, where have you been this morning? I saw you come in just now, I think!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot explain it, sir, further, {{than that}} the Lady Mansel sent me here, {{in spite of}} my earnest prayers, tears, and entreaties. I was not afraid of any thing, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be protected. But I could have died then--could die now--for very shame and confusion!" ...|$|R
