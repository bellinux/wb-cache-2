5|$|Since NASA's Space Shuttle {{program had}} not been launched, Derek Meddings and his miniatures team <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> the rocket launch footage without any reference. Shuttle models {{attached}} to bottle rockets and signal flares were used for take-off, and the smoke trail was created with salt that fell from the models. The space scenes were done by rewinding the camera after an element was shot, enabling other elements to be superimposed in the film stock, with the space battle needing up to forty rewinds to incorporate everything.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his release}} from the {{hospital}} and as a prisoner of war—the exact date is unknown—Schnaufer took over the family wine business. He had never planned to run the family winery as his ambition had always been to pursue an officer's career in the Luftwaffe. However, {{in the immediate aftermath}} of World War II the business had virtually ceased to exist and Schnaufer was given the task of rebuilding it from scratch. He had to re-establish business links to suppliers and customers and to consolidate them. Then he had to make new contacts in order to facilitate expansion and growth of the business. Lastly, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> an infrastructure which supported the growth of the business.|$|E
5|$|Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd list {{four main}} methods of {{creating}} machinima. From simple to advanced, these are: {{relying on the}} game's AI to control most actions, digital puppetry, recamming, and precise scripting of actions. Although simple to produce, AI-dependent results are unpredictable, thus complicating the realization of a preconceived film script. For example, when Rooster Teeth produced The Strangerhood using The Sims 2, a game that encourages the use of its AI, the group <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> multiple instances of each character to accommodate different moods. Individual instances were selected at different times to produce appropriate actions.|$|E

5|$|Fred Phillips, the {{original}} designer of Spock's Vulcan ears, served as The Motion Pictures makeup artist. He {{and his staff}} were responsible for fifty masks and makeup for the aliens seen in the film. The designs were developed by Phillips himself or else off Fletcher's sketches. In his long association with Star Trek Phillips produced his 2000th Spock ear during production of The Motion Picture. Each ear was made of latex and other ingredients blended together in a kitchen mixer, then baked for six hours. Though Phillips had saved {{the original}} television series casts used for making the appliances, Nimoy's ears had grown in the decade since and new molds had to be fabricated. While {{on the small screen}} the ears could be used up to four times, since nicks and tears did not show up on television, Phillips <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> around three pairs a day for Nimoy during filming. The upswept Vulcan eyebrows needed to be applied hair by hair for proper detail, and it took Nimoy more than two hours to prepare for filming—twice as long as it had for television.|$|E
5|$|He {{later became}} a steam enthusiast, befriending many of the engine drivers and firemen {{who worked on the}} nearby railway. As a {{teenager}} he met a driver who invited him onto the footplate of his locomotive and who asked him to keep the boiler supplied with fuel. Dibnah became so enamoured with steam engines that he eventually looked for one he could buy. He learnt of a steamroller kept in a barn near Warrington and which the owners had bought from Flintshire County Council. He had the boiler pressure-tested and, despite its being in poor condition, bought it for £175. He towed it to a friend's house, spent a fortnight making various repairs, and drove it to his mother's house in Bolton. After he married and bought his own property on Radcliffe New Road, he cut an access road to the garden of his new house and moved the steamroller there. Restoring the engine took many years, as Dibnah <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> his own replacement parts, using Victorian engineering techniques and equipment he built in his garden. The boiler was in poor condition and needed serious work, but Dibnah fell back on local knowledge and was eventually able to build a new boiler. Once it was restored, he used the 1910 Aveling and Porter steamroller together with a living van he bought and restored, to take his family around the local steam fairs. While driving the vehicle was relatively safe, Dibnah had experienced several mishaps, including one instance when he lost control while descending a steep hill and was forced to drive the engine into a concrete barrier to bring it to a halt, smashing the front fork in the process.|$|E
5|$|Kyo {{has been}} well-received by gamers, with his {{character}} appearing in several popularity polls. In Gamest's 1997 Heroes Collection, Kyo was voted as the staff's second favorite character, behind his rival Iori. In a 2005 poll made by SNK-Playmore USA, he was voted the sixth fan favorite character {{with a total}} of 176 votes. Additionally, in the January 30, 1995 issue of Gamest magazine in Japan, Kyo was featured at No. 4 in the Top 50 Characters of 1994. In the character popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak's website, he was voted as the third favorite character {{with a total of}} 2,574 votes. For the special endings in The King of Fighters '97, three video games journals, Gamest, Famitsu and Neo Geo Freak, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a team composed of three characters from the game so that they would be featured in an image after passing the arcade mode. The Neo Geo Freaks team created a team composed of Kyo, Mai Shiranui and Billy Kane. The special ending only appears in Japanese versions of the game. In an ASCII Media Works poll in which fans voted on whose video game or manga character they would like to name their children after, Kyo's name was tenth in the male category. Merchandising based on Kyo's appearance has also been released. Yutaka released an articulated action figure and a puzzle of Kyo from KoF '97. With the release of new video games in the series, SNK developed new action figures as well as key-chains.|$|E

Arjen decided to have each vocalist only sing one track each, as opposed to the almost conversational, rock opera-style singing which was utilized in previous albums.|$|E

25|$|Members of {{the church}} also mounted anti-gay protests at the trials of McKinney and Henderson. In response, Romaine Patterson, a friend of Shepard's, {{organized}} a group which assembled {{in a circle around}} the Westboro Baptist Church protesters, wearing white robes and gigantic wings (resembling angels) that blocked the protesters, despite Shepard's parents being able to hear the protesters shouting anti-gay remarks and comments at them. Police <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a human barrier between the two groups. Angel Action was founded by Patterson in April 1999.|$|E
25|$|In {{designing}} St Paul's, Christopher Wren {{had to meet}} many challenges. He <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> {{a fitting}} cathedral to replace Old St Paul's, {{as a place of}} worship and as a landmark within the City of London. He had to satisfy the requirements of the church and the tastes of a royal patron, as well as respecting the essentially mediaeval tradition of English church building which developed to accommodate the liturgy. Wren was familiar with contemporary Renaissance and Baroque trends in Italian architecture and had visited France, where he studied the work of François Mansart.|$|E

The collection is so large that the library <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a hybrid classification system based on the Dewey Decimal Classification System in order to make cataloging and location within the library much easier for both library staff and users. The library also houses the university’s archives, which holds some of the oldest deaf-related books and documents in the world.|$|E

25|$|According to the Moscow Armistice, {{signed by}} Finland and the victorious Allies, mainly the Soviet Union, the Finns were to try {{those who were}} {{responsible}} for the war and those who had committed war crimes.

The Finnish parliament <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> ex post facto laws for the trials, though in the case of war crimes the country had already signed the Hague IV Convention. In victorious Allied countries war-crime trials were exceptional, but Finland had to arrange full-scale investigations and trials, and report them for the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|In July 2011, the Constitutional Court {{ruled in}} a {{historic}} decision, that same-sex couples {{have the right to}} marry in Colombia. The Colombian Congress <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> an equivalent of marriage for same-sex couples by 20 June 2013, or else couples would automatically gain the right to go to any judge or notary public to formalise their union, according to the ruling. As the Colombia Congress failed to pass a same-sex marriage bill, the courts instead began approving marriages themselves. The same-sex marriage issue once again came before the Constitutional Court in 2015 after the country's Inspector General requested that the Court invalidate all the same-sex marriages approved in Colombia. A hearing took place in July 2015.|$|E
