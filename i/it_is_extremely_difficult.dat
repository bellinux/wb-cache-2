5|$|The {{virtue of}} a {{practical}} realization based upon this definition is that unlike the Kibble balance and other scale-based methods, {{all of which}} require the careful characterization of gravity in the laboratory, this method delineates {{the magnitude of the}} kilogram directly in the very terms that define the nature of mass: acceleration due to an applied force. Unfortunately, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> to develop a practical realization based upon accelerating masses. Experiments {{over a period of years}} in Japan with a superconducting, 30g mass supported by diamagnetic levitation never achieved an uncertainty better than ten parts per million. Magnetic hysteresis was one of the limiting issues. Other groups performed similar research that used different techniques to levitate the mass.|$|E
5|$|Kubera is the Buddhist Vaiśravaṇa or Jambhala, and the Japanese Bishamon. The Buddhist Vaisravana, {{like the}} Hindu Kubera, is the reagent of the North, a Loka-pala and the Lord of Yakshas. He {{is one of}} the Four Heavenly Kings, each {{associated}} with a cardinal direction. In Buddhist legends, Kubera is also equated with Pañcika, whose wife Hariti is the symbol of abundance. The iconography of Kubera and Pancika is so similar that in certain cases, A. Getty comments, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> to distinguish between Pancika and Kubera. The Japanese Bishamon, also known as Tamon-Ten, {{is one of the}} Jūni-Ten (十二天), a group of 12 Hindu deities adopted in Buddhism as guardian deities (deva or ten) who are found in or around Buddhist shrines. The Juni-Ten group of twelve deities were created by adding four deities to the older grouping of Happou-Ten, the eight guardians of the directions. Bishamon rules over the north, like his Hindu counterpart Kubera.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to predict}} good {{conditions}} for nucleation or growth of well-ordered crystals. In practice, favorable conditions are identified by screening; {{a very large}} batch of the molecules is prepared, and {{a wide variety of}} crystallization solutions are tested. Hundreds, even thousands, of solution conditions are generally tried before finding the successful one. The various conditions can use one or more physical mechanisms to lower the solubility of the molecule; for example, some may change the pH, some contain salts of the Hofmeister series or chemicals that lower the dielectric constant of the solution, and still others contain large polymers such as polyethylene glycol that drive the molecule out of solution by entropic effects. It is also common to try several temperatures for encouraging crystallization, or to gradually lower the temperature so that the solution becomes supersaturated. These methods require large amounts of the target molecule, as they use high concentration of the molecule(s) to be crystallized. Due to the difficulty in obtaining such large quantities (milligrams) of crystallization-grade protein, robots have been developed that are capable of accurately dispensing crystallization trial drops that are in the order of 100 nanoliters in volume. This means that 10-fold less protein is used per experiment when compared to crystallization trials set up by hand (in the order of 1 microliter).|$|E

25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{is present}} in small amounts in the atmosphere, chiefly {{as a product of}} volcanic activity but also from natural and man-made fires (such as forest and bushfires, burning of crop residues, and sugarcane fire-cleaning). The burning of fossil fuels also contributes to carbon monoxide production. Carbon monoxide occurs dissolved in molten volcanic rock at high pressures in the Earth's mantle.

25|$|Non-medical use of {{fentanyl}} {{by individuals}} without opiate tolerance {{can be very}} dangerous and has resulted in numerous deaths.

Once the fentanyl is in the user's system, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> to stop its course {{because of the nature of}} absorption. Illicitly synthesized fentanyl powder has also appeared on the United States market. Because of the extremely high strength of pure fentanyl powder, it is very difficult to dilute appropriately, and often the resulting mixture may be far too strong and, therefore, very dangerous.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{agreement}} {{of a system}} design, RTL designers then implement the functional models in a hardware description language like Verilog, SystemVerilog, or VHDL. Using digital design components like adders, shifters, and state machines as well as computer architecture concepts like pipelining, superscalar execution, and branch prediction, RTL designers will break a functional description into hardware models of components on the chip working together. Each of the simple statements described in the system design can easily turn into thousands of lines of RTL code, which is why <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> to verify that the RTL will {{do the right thing}} in all the possible cases that the user may throw at it.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{multitude}} of different ethnic and religious identities of the Muslim Bulgarians, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> to calculate {{the exact number of}} the members of the community in Bulgaria. An inquiry conducted by the Bulgaran Ministry of the Interior in 1989 estimated their number at 269,000. A summation of the different groups with different religious and ethnic identities (approximately 130,000 Muslim Bulgarians, approximately 55,000-65,000 non-religious Bulgarians, up to 50,000 Muslim Turks, 15,000 to 20,000 undeclared and an unclear number, probably at least several thousands, of Christian Bulgarians) yields approximately the same number. Despite {{the multitude}} of different ethnic and religious affiliations, the predominant ethnic identity would be Bulgarian (approximately 200,000 or three-quarters of the total population) and the predominant religious identity would be Muslim (again approximately 200,000 or three-quarters of the total population). However, if only self-consciousness and self-declaration are taken into consideration, the number of Muslim Bulgarians would be only 131,531, i.e. the ones who have declared as such at the 2001 census.|$|E

25|$|Optimism bias is {{typically}} measured through two determinants of risk: absolute risk, where individuals {{are asked to}} estimate their likelihood of experiencing a negative event compared to their actual chance of experiencing a negative event (comparison against self), and comparative risk, where individuals are asked to estimate the likelihood of experiencing a negative event (their personal risk estimate) compared to others {{of the same age}} and sex (a target risk estimate). Problems can occur when trying to measure absolute risk because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> to determine the actual risk statistic for a person. Therefore, the optimistic bias is primarily measured in comparative risk forms, where people compare themselves against others, through direct and indirect comparisons. Direct comparisons ask whether an individual's own risk of experiencing an event is less than, greater than, or equal to someone else's risk, while indirect comparisons ask individuals to provide separate estimates of their own risk of experiencing an event and other's risk of experiencing the same event.|$|E
25|$|The {{cognitive}} mechanism {{involved in the}} Stroop task {{is referred to as}} directed attention. The Stroop task requires the participant to engage in and allows assessment of processes such as attention management, speed and accuracy of reading words and colours and of inhibition of competing stimuli. The stimulus is a colour word that is printed in a different colour than what the written word reads. For example, the word “red” is written in a blue font. One must verbally classify the colour that the word is displayed/printed in, while ignoring the information provided by the written word. In the aforementioned example, this would require the participant to say “blue” when presented with the stimulus. Although the majority of people will show some slowing when given incompatible text versus font colour, this is more severe in individuals with deficits in inhibition. The Stroop task takes advantage of the fact that most humans are so proficient at reading colour words that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> to ignore this information, and instead acknowledge, recognize and say the colour the word is printed in. The Stroop task is an assessment of attentional vitality and flexibility. More modern variations of the Stroop task tend to be more difficult and often try to limit the sensitivity of the test.|$|E

500|$|The dog's coat {{has been}} {{described}} as shaggy, hard, and rugged in style and it has also been described as linty in texture, giving the breed the nickname of [...] "linty-haired terrier".

500|$|Stegosaurus armatus, meaning [...] "armored roof lizard", was {{the first}} species to be found and the {{original}} type species named by O.C. Marsh in 1877. It is known from a partial skeletons, and more than 30 fragmentary specimens have been referred to it. However, the type specimen was very fragmentary, consisting only of a partial tail, hips, and leg, parts of some back vertebrae, and a single fragmentary plate (the presence of which was used to give the animal its name). No other plates or spikes were found, and the entire front half of the animal appears {{not to have been}} preserved. Because the type specimen is very fragmentary, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> to compare it with other species based on better specimens, and it is now generally considered to be a nomen dubium.

500|$|The Court {{has twice}} {{considered}} {{the role of}} the Clause in the prosecution of federal members of Congress for bribery under § 201. In United States v.

[...] Brewster reinstated a dismissed § 201 indictment because the crime of bribery is complete once the bribe is accepted, whether or not the official performs the promised act. In United States v. Helstoski (1979), the Court held that the prosecution may not introduce any evidence of a past [...] "legislative act" [...] at trial. According to Weeks, [...] "s a practical matter, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> to successfully prosecute a section 201 action if reference to a defendant's legislative acts is forbidden." ...|$|E
50|$|The former {{practice}} {{became more}} and more common after 1930.

500|$|Linois {{continued}} his raiding, achieving some success against individual sailing ships, but failing to press successfully his numerical superiority against British naval forces; most notably at the Battle of Vizagapatam on 15 September 1804 and the Action of 6 August 1805. Ironically, Linois was eventually captured at the Action of 13 March 1806 after mistaking {{a squadron of}} British ships of the line for a merchant convoy in the mid-Atlantic. Linois was concerned throughout the engagement {{for the safety of}} his ships: with the nearest dockyard over [...] away at Île de France, he could not afford to suffer severe damage to his rigging or masts that would leave his squadron crippled. He also sought to defend his behaviour off Pulo Aura with the claim that the British convoy was protected by as many as eight ships of the line, and that he had performed heroically in saving his squadron from this overwhelming force. Subsequent historians have ridiculed this latter statement: William James wryly commented in his account of the action, written in 1827, that [...] "it would be uncharitable to call into question the courage of Rear-admiral Linois" [...] and William Laird Clowes stated in 1900 that [...] "his timidity and want of enterprise threw away a great opportunity". Nicholas Rodger, writing in 2004, was even more critical, insisting that [...] "his [...] officers do not seem to have been fooled, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> to believe that he was." [...] He goes on to suggest that no experienced seaman could possibly have mistaken a poorly manned and poorly trained merchant crew for the crew of a real Royal Navy ship of the line, concluding that [...] "Linois had thrown away a prize worth at least £8 million through mere timidity". The most scathing criticism of Linois's conduct came from Napoleon himself, who wrote to Minister of Marine Denis Decrès on the subject, stating: ...|$|E
