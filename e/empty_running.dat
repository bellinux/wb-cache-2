30|$|As {{noted in}} this table, 10.8 % of the {{vehicles}} surveyed were running empty. However, this percentage closely reflects the type of vehicle. Some vehicles, such as tautliners, are quite versatile, and present <b>empty</b> <b>running</b> factors of less than 10 %. More specialised trailers, such as tankers and dry bulks, have much higher <b>empty</b> <b>running</b> factors, in excess of 20 %.

Transport efficiency slightly increased during investigated period, 7.3 and 7.2 tonne kilometers per vehicle kilometers in 2003 and 1997.

30|$|By definition, any {{forecast}} {{provides a}} degree of uncertainty, and that is certainly true of this research where the forecast year is distant, 2050. The uncertainty in forecasting has been highlighted {{by a number of}} studies. Piecyk and McKinnon (2010) reported that truck <b>empty</b> <b>running</b> would reduce by 20  % between 2006 and 2020 through a Delphi survey with 00 logistics experts. Regarding the forecast, McKinnon (2014) found that the <b>empty</b> <b>running</b> had increased by 9  % by 2010 – significantly earlier than the forecast period. This again highlights the difficulties faced by forecasters and the inherently uncertain nature of forecasts as demonstrated by a leader in this field.|$|E
30|$|As the {{literature}} findings above suggest, increased average payload (or fill-rates) and decreased <b>empty</b> <b>running</b> are possible parts of green logistics services offered by LSPs or required by shippers.

30|$|With a load {{capacity}} of 5.6 million tonnes, load factors of 80 % and 40 % (depending if <b>empty</b> <b>running</b> is excluded or not) indicated potential {{for improving the}} values {{based on the fact}} that some vehicles achieve higher load factors than others. Regarding <b>empty</b> <b>running,</b> 47 % of operations and 26 % of kilometers were done with empty vehicles showing the potential for enhancing the efficiency of delivery operations. Given the current demand patterns, the lowest attainable percentage of empty moves has not been reached yet. Vehicle time utilization had an average value of 79 %. This value is higher that the value presented by McKinnon [26], around 63 %, which excluded from the total vehicle hour utilization: the driver’s rest period on the road, idle and undergoing maintenance and repairs. The genesis of the differences could be the high percentage of public service vehicles [14]; the vehicle is the main economic source of the company and does not depend on other economic activities.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of any transport operation {{is dependent on}} the degree to which vehicle capacity is utilised on the forward and return trips. Efficiency requirements create the logistical challenges of finding backloads for returning vehicles. In the absence of backloads, vehicles travel empty on the return journey. Construction is fundamentally different from other freight services in that apart from requiring large quantities of material inputs, it also generates appreciable levels of waste. There is therefore, potential for reducing <b>empty</b> <b>running</b> by construction trucks through back-loading waste to points of disposal, reuse, recycling or reclamation. Back-loading, {{which is one of the}} reverse logistics processes is important for returning products that are damaged, obsolete or worn out and those unacceptable to buyers. Back-loading is also associated with utilising spare capacity in the supply chain to increase return on truck investment. This paper examines the operations and processes associated with construction materials and waste logistics and assesses the potential for reduction in truck <b>empty</b> <b>running</b> through utilisation of the reverse logistics concept...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor a given {{transport}} demand, {{increasing the}} load {{is a good}} way to decrease CO 2 emissions without reducing freight mobility. The paper analyses the links between vehicle load, energy efficiency and CO 2 emissions and discusses where and how higher load could be achieved. The main determinants of load limitation are vehicle capacity, load rate for loaded trips and <b>empty</b> <b>running.</b> Vehicle capacity can be limited either by rules on weight and dimensions (for instance maximum authorized length and width for trucks), by the characteristics of the route (for instance draught for sea ports and waterways) and/or by the transport mode economy (maximum load weight for airplanes). The load rate for loaded trips is influenced by the volume and characteristics of the demand, mainly shipment size, type of commodity (density) and just-in-time practices, while the rate of <b>empty</b> <b>running</b> is rather influenced by the imbalance of physical trades. These two rates can be upgraded by improving transport organizers’ information, their effectiveness in grouping parcels and shipments in consolidated loads and in reducing freight market barriers.

50|$|During {{the first}} period of {{tendered}} operations the single track section between Brügge and Hagen-Delstern was rebuilt in order to accelerate it.

Passenger trains may be delayed in reaching their scheduled crossings in Rummenohl, leading to further delays, which cancel out the intended acceleration.|$|R

30|$|In the Alltransport–Holmen case, {{responses}} from representatives from both companies indicate that environmental consideration {{is not on}} the agenda when Holmen buys logistics services from Alltransport. Interestingly, representatives at Alltransport initially said that environmental practices {{are a part of the}} relationship between the two companies, but then added that no actual green requirements are put on Alltransport from Holmen. Instead, the results suggest that there is a difference between how Alltransport and Holmen view practices such as high fill-rates and <b>empty</b> <b>running,</b> which Alltransport perceives as environmental practices, most likely in combination with cost savings, while Holmen merely sees cost-saving potential. These two practices are, in accordance with McKinnon [34], part of the general environmental practice transport management that has previously been discussed.|$|E
30|$|Two {{scenarios}} {{were made}} for freight transport, the reference (BAU) scenario and the recommendation scenario. In the two scenarios, the GVA, value density and average length of haul {{are assumed to be}} the same. Hence, the total haulage is the same in both scenarios and in line with the national traffic forecast [13]. In the reference scenario, the share of <b>empty</b> <b>running,</b> average load on laden trips and average fuel consumption are assumed to develop until 2030 as forecasted in a previous study [24] and then level off, with some slight changes due to relative importance of different types of commodities transported. In the recommendation scenario, these indicator values are assumed to further improve after 2030. The CO 2 content of energy is assumed to be the same as in passenger transport.|$|E

Particular attention had {{to be given to}} the management and communication of information flow among the several actors or collaborating organisations [38], so the research recommended that the technical solution be complemented by a freight integrator who would provide the link between all main parties (rail and/or transport operators and shippers/consignees) and also aggregate cargo to realise full-load train service and eliminate <b>empty</b> <b>running.</b>|$|E
30|$|As {{almost all}} CO 2 {{emissions}} from freight transport operations are energy related, {{the most accurate}} way of calculating these emissions is to record energy consumption, e.g., in terms of liters of fuel, and to employ standard emission factors to convert energy values into CO 2 [2]. The amount of fuel consumed by a vehicle, in turn, depends {{on a variety of}} vehicle-, environment-, operations-, and traffic-related parameters, such as vehicle characteristics, length of haul, travel speed, payload, road gradient, driving behavior, traffic conditions, fleet size, fleet mix, and <b>empty</b> <b>running</b> [3, 4, 5]. While some of these factors, such as transportation technologies and fuels, have improved over the years, traffic congestion has not diminished, but is forecast to further increase in many countries, such as France, Germany, the UK, and the USA [6, 7].|$|E

A “weaker ” decoupling trend can be seen looking at vehicle-km resulting from increased logistic efficiency (less <b>empty</b> <b>running</b> and increased average pay-load).

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of producers, retailers and third-party logistics providers are interested in carrying out energy assessments of their product supply chain.

40|$|In {{recent years}} many European {{countries}} {{have seen a}} decoupling of the growth in road freight traffic (vehicle kilometres) from economic growth. A similar decoupling has not been observed in road freight transport (tonne kilometres). In this paper the historical growth in national Danish road freight traffic and transport is attributed to causes using a Divisia index decomposition method. It is demonstrated that overall road freight traffic growth {{is a consequence of}} often opposite pointing growth effects in the underlying factors. The observed decoupling of road freight traffic growth from economic growth is mainly the result of use of larger vehicles, increasing average loads, and less <b>empty</b> <b>running.</b> Growth in road freight transport is primarily caused by growth in production.

An analytical aggregation of the different results is offered, in order to obtain and homogeneous transport cost function, and several applications have been introduced to explain the proposed models...|$|E
