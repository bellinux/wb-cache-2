For example, increased winter precipitation (rain and snow) could harm populations {{of freshwater fish}} in Norway, whereas warmer summers could increase growth of adult fish.

It is uncertain how ocean acidification, caused by rising carbon dioxide levels, might affect teleosts.|$|E

5|$|The {{survival}} {{of this species}} is tied closely to rainfall because of the susceptibility of seedlings to drought. It is thus especially vulnerable to the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change. This was recognised as early as 1992, when {{it was noted that}} winter rainfall in the Quairading region had been falling by about 4% per decade, and that a continuation of this trend may reduce the species' distribution. Recently, a more thorough assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to extinction, and mild change to a reduction of its range by 80% by 2080. However, there may not be any range reduction at all under mid-severity climate change, depending on how effectively this species can migrate into newly habitable areas.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{classify}} climates into similar regimes. Originally, climes were defined in Ancient Greece to describe the weather depending upon a location's latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into genetic methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and empiric methods, which focus on the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate.</b> Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the relative frequency of different air mass types or locations within synoptic weather disturbances. Examples of empiric classifications include climate zones defined by plant hardiness, evapotranspiration, or more generally the Köppen climate classification which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain biomes. A common shortcoming of these classification schemes is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{the wood of}} different trees, the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The wood of palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E

40|$|<b>Climate</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the main}} drivers of species distribution. However, as {{different}} environmental factors tend to co-vary, the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> cannot {{be taken at}} face value, {{as it may be}} either inflated or obscured by other correlated factors. We used the favourability models of four species (Alytes dickhilleni, Vipera latasti, Aquila fasciata and Capra pyrenaica) inhabiting Spanish mountains as case studies to evaluate the relative contribution <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> in their forecasted favourability by using variation partitioning and weighting the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> in relation to non-climatic factors. By calculating the pure <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the climatic factor, the pure <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> non-climatic factors, the shared climatic effect and the proportion <b>of</b> the pure <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the climatic factor in relation to its apparent effect (r), we assessed the apparent effect and the pure independent <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate.</b> We then projected both types <b>of</b> <b>effects</b> when modelling the future favourability for each species and combination of AOGCM-SRES (two Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models: CGCM 2 and ECHAM 4, and two Special Reports on Emission Scenarios (SRES) : A 2 and B 2). The results show that the apparent <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> can be either inflated (overrated) or obscured (underrated) by other correlated factors. These differences were species-specific; the sum of favourable areas forecasted according to the pure climatic effect differed from that forecasted according to the apparent climatic effect by about 61 % on average for one of the species analyzed, and by about 20 % on average for each of the other species. The pure <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> future <b>climate</b> on species distributions can only be estimated by combining climate with other factors. Transferring the pure climatic effect and the apparent climatic effect to the future delimits the maximum and minimum favourable areas forecasted for each species in each climate change scenario.
