40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{discount}} rate policies of five Federal Reserve chairmen: Martin, Burns, Miller, Volcker and Greenspan. Both {{in terms of the}} reasons given for making discount rate changes and the frequency of discount rate changes, {{the discount rate}} policies of Martin and Greenspan were very similar, as were those of Burns and Volcker. The <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> <b>policy</b> of Chairman Miller differed from either of these groups. Measured by the money market's response to discount rate changes, the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> <b>policy</b> of Burns and Volcker was the most effective and Miller's the least effective. Evidence is presented that suggests that the differential response {{is due to the fact}} that the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> <b>policy</b> of Burns and Volcker provided the market with more complete information than that of Martin and Greenspan. The evidence also supports critics of the Federal Reserve's <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> <b>policy</b> prior to the early 1960 s. Discount; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (U.

These policies are represented by the government policy sub-component. Three policy types are focused on, including climate change policy [G 1], economic <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> <b>policy</b> [G 2] and emissions <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> <b>policy</b> [G 3]. These policies can significantly affect the operational costs and GHG emissions of a WDS when accumulated over longer time-periods. Therefore, it is important to consider the effects of policies over the entire life of a WDS, including both design and operational phases. This component has been included to highlight the importance of being able to consider the effects of policy on the optimal design and operation of a WDS.|$|E

Relaxing the assumption that market interest rates are perfectly controlled by the central bank using the funds rate operating procedure, we have shown that the equilibrium at the zero lower bound on the nominal discount rate is stable (or cyclically stable, depending on monetary and financial parameters) and constitutes a liquidity trap, making the central bank’s communication skills useless in the crisis management. While the quantitative easing policy allows attenuating the effects of crisis, it is not always sufficient to restore the normal equilibrium. Nevertheless, quantitative and credit easing policies coupled with the zero <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> <b>policy</b> could stabilize the economy and make central bank’s communication potentially credible during the crisis. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{decision-making}} process of the monetary policy in postwar Japan, focusing on the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> <b>policy.</b> Since late 1950 's, BOJ has generally given priority to WPI as a criterion to judge {{the timing of the}} discount rate change. In 1950 's, when prosperity overheated, WPI rose sharply, before current balance of payments turned into deficit. Then BOJ judged that the discount rate should be raised, while current balance was still in surplus. Only in early and middle 1960 's, when was general balance of payments turned into deficit under stable WPI, BOJ took the general balance deficit as the criterion. In late 1960 's, when large and continuous balance of payments surplus emerged, BOJ came to judge the timing of the discount rate change according to WPI again. The serious inflation in early 1970 's was partly because of this policy stance of BOJ. It continued loose monetary policy, on the ground that WPI was stable, although money supply had increased substantially. Reflecting on this experience, BOJ came to make much of money supply in the middle of 1970 's. However, even in 1979, it was after WPI began to rise rapidly when BOJ judged that the discount rate should be raised. In the latter half of 1980 's, BOJ watched excessive money supply and rise of asset prices as early as 1986. However, it did not make up its mind to raise the discount rate until WPI started to rise in 1989, when the serious asset price inflation had already took place. Actually, <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> <b>policy</b> was determined not only by BOJ's judgement but also by the policy of the government. In this sense, BOJ has not been independent of the government. In general, when the government was carrying out expanding policy, the time lag between BOJ's judgement and the raise of the discount rate was long, and vice versa. In early 1970 's and late 1980 's, the expanding policy stance of the government made the raise the discount rate still later, which caused rapid inflation and asset price inflation. ...|$|E
40|$|Conventional wisdom {{has that}} {{peripheral}} economies had to `play {{by the rules}} of the game` under the Classical Gold Standard (1870 s- 1914), while core countries could get away with frequent violations. Drawing on the experience of three core economies (England, France, Germany) and seven peripheral economies (Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Norway, Serbia, Sweden), my paper argues for a more nuanced perspective on the European periphery. While the conventional view might be true for some countries - most notably the Balkan countries - our findings, based on a VAR model and impulse response functions, suggest that the average gold drain that a specific peripheral economy was exposed to differed substantially from country to country. We also show that some of the peripheral economies, most notably Austria-Hungary, always enjoyed enough pulling power via <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> <b>policy</b> to reverse quickly any such gold outflow. In sum, while the experience of some peripheral economies under gold was poor and hence normally short-lived, the experience of other peripheral countries resembled more those of the core economies. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{views the}} policy {{response}} to the recent financial crisis {{from the perspective of}} Milton Friedman’s monetary economics. Five major aspects of the policy response were: 1) discount window lending was provided broadly to the financial system, at rates that were low in relation to the market rates prevailing before the crisis; 2) the Federal Reserve’s holdings of government securities were adjusted with the aim of putting downward pressure on the path of several important interest rates for a given path of short-term rates; 3) deposit insurance was extended, helping to insulate the money stock from credit market disruption; 4) the commercial banking system received assistance via a recapitalization program, while existing equity holders have borne losses; and 5) an interest-on-reserves system was introduced. These five elements of the policy response were in keeping with those that would arise from Friedman’s framework, while a number of the five departed appreciably from other prominent benchmarks (such as the Bagehot-Thornton prescription for <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> <b>policy,</b> and New Keynesian approaches to stabilization policy). One notable part of the policy response, the TALF initiative, drew largely on frameworks other than Friedman’s.

40|$|Traditionally, {{monetary}} {{policy has been}} conducted under a veil of secrecy. In its landmark Freedom of Information Act case, the Federal Reserve argued that it needed to delay the disclosure of its policy decision, claiming that immediate disclosure would cause the market to overreact or react {{in a way that}} was inconsistent with the Fed's intentions. Based on this argument and others, the Fed was permitted to delay the release of FOMC policy decisions. Contrary to the Fed's assertion, most economists believe that market forces would work to keep equilibrium outcomes more in line with policy maker's intentions if policy makers would announce their intentions and establish a reputation for behaving in a manner consistent with them. This paper tests the hypothesis that the market responds more closely to the Fed's intentions when the Fed makes its intentions known by investigating the market's reaction to a change in <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> <b>policy</b> in the 1960 s. We find that the market responded in a manner inconsistent with the Fed's intentions when they were unknown, and responds in a manner consistent with them when the Fed made its intentions known.

40|$|Drawing on {{monthly data}} for 12 European {{countries}}, this paper asks whether countries under the Classical Gold Standard followed the so-called “rules of the game” and, if so, whether the external constraint implied {{by these rules}} was more binding for the periphery than for the core. Our econometric focus is a probit estimation of the central bank discount rate behaviour. Three main findings emerge: First, all countries followed specific rules but rules were different for core countries as opposed to peripheral countries. The discount rate decisions of core countries were motivated by keeping the exchange-rate within the gold points. In stark contrast, the discount rate decisions of peripheral countries reflected changes in the domestic cover ratio. The main reason for the different rules was the limited effectiveness of the discount rate tool for peripheral countries which resulted in more frequent gold point violations. Consequently, peripheral countries relied on high reserve levels and oriented their <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> <b>policy</b> towards maintaining the reserve level. Second, there was {{a substantial amount of}} discretionary monetary policy left to all countries, even though we find that core countries enjoyed marginally more liberty in setting their discount rate than peripheral countries. Third, interest rate decisions were influenced more by Berlin than by London, suggesting that the European branch of the Classical Gold Standard was less London-centered than hitherto assumed. gold standard, rules of the game, balance-of-payment adjustment, central banking...|$|E
40|$|Recently, Reinhart and Sbrancia (2011) {{proposed}} {{a new path}} of policymaking by demonstrating how public debt could be -and had been- liquidated by using a financial repression policy. In fact, we have learnt from History that public debt could be reduced without having to act too strongly on public expenses. However, stronger state regulations are necessary and central bankers should empower both the banking and financial sectors. The aim {{of this paper is}} to take that proposition of financial repression for granted and demonstrating it from the French interwar case. In fact, France succeeded to manage its huge public debt (inherited from WWI) thanks to a fixed <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> <b>policy</b> which can be seen as a ceiling on interest rate policy. This central bank -or state- intervention is the leading measure of a financial repression policy (associated with a relevant banking and fiscal regulations). Moreover, the article draw from French history and economic theory a debt-reduction dynamics rule: if real interest rate on government is lower than the real growth rate, thus, the debt/GDP ratio will fall over the time. Moreover, to a broader extent, the article draw a general conclusion in terms of monetary policymaking (Konig 1993).

40|$|The {{notion of}} rule {{surrounded}} {{the gold standard}} system. For instance, it is not seldom to present the gold standard system under the 1925 Keynesian expression as {{the rules of the}} game. However, it is nowadays quite crystal clear that gold standard system was not such a self regulating system in which automatic rules prevailed (Eichengreen 1996; Mouré 2001). At the same time, the behaviour of the French bank of issue in the inter-war period gave rise to polemic (Nurkse 1944). The paper proposes to examine the conduct of the French monetary management in the inter-war period by focusing on the context and behaviour adopted by Bank of France. Three points emerge from the study. (1) Before explaining the way franc was managed, we need to make a short recall {{on the state of the}} French economy after WWI and on the way the French banker system functioned. (2) The monetary management implemented by the Bank of France is both characterized by a <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> <b>policy</b> and by the total rejection of open-market operations. This way of managing the franc can be explained by the French historical background and by the conflict between the two leading economists of the moment: C. Rist and P. Quesnay. (3) In order to illustrate the French monetary policymaking the paper will expose the peculiar policy implemented by Bank of France between 1928 and 1932. This way of behaving -based on the gold gathering at the expense of the other countries- was roughly criticized in Europe since France was accused of being responsible of the 1930 's international depression.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of monetary policy is an understanding of the transmission process: the mechanism through which the monetary policy actions of the Central Bank impact on aggregate demand and prices by influencing the investment and consumption decisions of households and firms. Thus, commercial banks are regarded as conveyers of monetary policy shocks and are expected to adjust retail interest rates in response to policy shocks one-to-one. In practice, commercial banks adjust their retail rates in response to changes in monetary policy with a lag of several months and this delay is often viewed as an impediment on the ability of the Central Bank to steer the economy. Several reasons, such as credit rationing and adverse selection, switching costs, risk sharing, consumer irrationality, structure of the financial system, menu costs and asymmetric information are some of the causes advanced for commercial banks retail rates being sticky. In spite of the important role of pass-through analysis in the monetary policy transmission process, it has received very little attention in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially in Cameroon and Nigeria, which have implemented a series of reforms. To this end, this study gives a comparative analysis of interest rate pass-through in Nigeria and Cameroon using retail rates (lending and deposit) and a <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> (<b>policy</b> rate) from January 1990 to December 2010 for Nigeria and from January 1990 to June 2008 for Cameroon. The study examines the magnitude and speed of retail rate adjustments to changes in the Central Bank policy rate as well as examining the possibility of symmetric and asymmetric pass-through in both countries. In addition, the study also investigates whether there is pass-through of monetary policy from one country to the other. The empirical analysis employs four different types of co-integration techniques to test the presence of a long run co-integrating relationship between retail and the policy rates {{in order to ensure that}} the relationship detected is robust. Three sets of analyses are carried out in the study. Following Cottarelli and Kourelis (1994), the study employed a co-integration technique, firstly, to analyse pass-through for the entire sample, secondly, to analyse symmetric and asymmetric pass-through using a ten year rolling window analysis in an error correction framework. Finally, the policy rates were swapped around to investigate if there are transmissions of impulses from one country to the other. Overall, evidence from the entire sample and rolling window analysis suggests that monetary policy in Cameroon is less effective. This is perhaps one of the reasons why the Banque Des Etats De L’Afrique Centrale (BEAC) is unable to sterilise the excess liquidity of the banking sector in Cameroon. The long run pass-through of 0. 72 and 0. 71 for the entire sample, and the average long run pass-through for the rolling window of 0. 78 and 0. 76 for the lending and deposit rates, suggest that monetary policy is highly effective in Nigeria compared to Cameroon. The empirical evidence confirmed asymmetric adjustment in six rolling windows in the lending rate in Nigeria. Three rolling windows indicated that the direction of rigidity is downward, supporting Scholnick’s (1996) collusive pricing arrangement between banks, and the other three suggested that the lending rate is rigid in the upward direction, corroborating Scholnick’s (1996) customer reaction hypothesis. The deposit rate in Cameroon was also found to adjust asymmetrically and the direction of rigidity is downward, supporting Hannan and Berger’s (1991) customer reaction hypothesis. The investigation of impulse transmission between the two countries revealed that only the policy rate in Nigeria exerts some influence on the deposit rate in Cameroon. Policy recommendations are also discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{construct}} a simple probit {{model of the}} determinants of real house price slump endings. � We find that {{the probability of a}} house price slump ending is higher, the smaller was the pre-slump house price run-up; the greater has been the cumualtive house price decline; the lower are real mortgage interest rates; and the higher is GDP growth. � Slumps are longer, other things being equal, where housing supply is more elastic, but shorter the more developed are financial institutions. � For slumps of a given size, shorter sharper slumps are associated with worse macroeconomic performance in the short run, but with better performance in the long run. � This suggests that for sufficiently low <b>discount</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>policy</b> makers should not impede the decline in real house prices, and this conclusion is reinforced by the finding that after a certain duration, house price slumps can become self-reinforcing. � On the other hand, we also find evidence that during downturns, falling house prices can lead to lower private sector credit flows. � Policy makers thus face a delicate balancing act. � While they should not intervene to artifically prop up overvalued house prices, they should ensure that their macroeconomic and banking policies are such as to make a bottoming-out more likely. � This suggests that they should keep real interest rates low, and ensure that banks are well-capitalised.

40|$|Nearly all {{discussions about}} the {{appropriate}} consumption <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> for climate-change <b>policy</b> evaluation assume that a single <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> concept applies. We argue that two distinct concepts and associated rates apply. We distinguish a social-welfare-equivalent <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> appropriate for determining whether a given policy would augment social welfare (according to a postulated social welfare function) and a finance-equivalent <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> suitable for determining whether the policy would offer a potential Pareto improvement. Distinguishing the two rates helps resolve arguments {{as to whether the}} choice of <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> should be based on ethical considerations or empirical information (such as market interest rates), and about whether the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> should serve a prescriptive or descriptive role. Separating out the two rates also helps clarify disputes about the appropriate stringency of climate change policy. We find that the structure of leading numerical optimization models used for climate policy analysis may have helped contribute to the blurring {{of the differences between the}} two rates. In addition, we indicate that uncertainty about underlying ethical parameters or market conditions implies that both rates should decline as the time-horizon increases...|$|R
40|$|I {{provide a}} {{selective}} review of discounting and climate policy. After reviewing {{evidence on the}} importance of the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> in setting <b>policy,</b> I ask whether standard models tend to exaggerate the sacrifices that the current generation needs to undertake in order to internalize climate damages. I then consider whether the risk of catastrophic damage really overwhelms discounting, in the determination of optimal policy. I revisit the question of how we actually think about the distant future. climate change, discounting, intergenerational conflict, catastrophic risk, hyperbolic discounting, Natural Resources and Conservation...|$|R
40|$|We {{apply the}} outlier {{methodology}} {{to the issue}} of the regulation of Bimetallism. Did French and British central banks use their <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> as a <b>policy</b> tool for currency stabilization over the period 1850 - 1870 ? The common view identifies Bimetallism as a pure automatic system constrained by specie points. Using outliers methodology we give evidence that the influence of the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> differential between France and England on the Sterling-Franc spot exchange rate was taken in default only on one occasion, on February 1861. The assessment of the historical context helps to understand this peculiar event which was only transitory. This article is an illustration {{of the importance of the}} outlier methodology in cliometrics as a mean to test conventional wisdom in economic history. ...|$|R
40|$|Health policy models provide {{measures}} of the effectiveness and costs of complex health care interventions {{making it possible to}} compare different policies. We look at the validity of models of screening, prevention and treatment, focusing on two simulation studies. In designing models, account must be taken of disease trends and changing treatment patterns. The choice of modelling technique and of system boundaries are shown {{to have an impact on}} results. Decisions have to be made about data which may be scarce or inappropriate for modelling purposes. Cost-effectiveness measures are based on the ratio of costs to benefits, such as life years saved or quality adjusted life years. These are sensitive to the time period and the <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> chosen. <b>Policy</b> makers should be aware of these different sources of variability or error. For decision making purposes, the calculation of output measures must be based on the same assumptions...|$|R
