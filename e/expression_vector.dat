For example, if the experimentalists wish to harvest a particular protein from the recombinant organism, then an <b>expression</b> <b>vector</b> is chosen that contains appropriate signals for transcription and translation in the desired host organism. Alternatively, if replication of the DNA in different species is desired (for example, transfer of DNA from bacteria to plants), then a multiple host range vector (also termed shuttle vector) may be selected. In practice, however, specialized molecular cloning experiments usually begin with cloning into a bacterial plasmid, followed by subcloning into a specialized vector.|$|E
25|$|By {{replacing}} the gene {{with a new}} version fused to a green fluorescent protein (or similar) marker, expression may be directly quantified in live cells. This is done by imaging using a fluorescence microscope. It {{is very difficult to}} clone a GFP-fused protein into its native location in the genome without affecting expression levels so this method often cannot be used to measure endogenous gene expression. It is, however, widely used to measure the expression of a gene artificially introduced into the cell, for example via an <b>expression</b> <b>vector.</b> It {{is important to note that}} by fusing a target protein to a fluorescent reporter the protein's behavior, including its cellular localization and expression level, can be significantly changed.|$|E

25|$|Gene {{knockdown}} by transfection of exogenous siRNA {{is often}} unsatisfactory because {{the effect is}} only transient, especially in rapidly dividing cells. This may be overcome by creating an <b>expression</b> <b>vector</b> for the siRNA. The siRNA sequence is modified to introduce a short loop between the two strands. The resulting transcript is a short hairpin RNA (shRNA), which can be processed into a functional siRNA by Dicer in its usual fashion.. Typical transcription cassettes use an RNA polymerase III promoter (e.g., U6 or H1) to direct the transcription of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (U6 is involved in gene splicing; H1 is the RNase component of human RNase P). It is theorized that the resulting siRNA transcript is then processed by Dicer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Viral {{promoters}} {{are used}} in mammalian <b>expression</b> <b>vectors</b> because they generally have strong activity {{in a wide variety}} of cells of differing tissues and species. Methods The utility of the BLV LTR/promoter (BLVp) for use in mammalian <b>expression</b> <b>vectors</b> was investigated through direct comparison to the CMV promoter (CMVp). Promoter activity was measured using luciferase assays of cell lines from different tissues and species stably transduced with BLVp or CMVp driven luciferase vectors including D 17, FLK, BL 3. 1 and primary bovine B cells. Cells were also modified through the addition of BLV Tax <b>expression</b> <b>vectors</b> and/or BLV infection as well as treatment with trichostatin A (TSA). Results Results indicate the BLV promoter, while having low basal activity compared to the CMV promoter, can be induced to high-levels of activity similar to the CMV promoter in all cells tested. Tax or BLV infection specifically enhanced BLVp activity with no effect on CMVp activity. In contrast, the non-specific activator, TSA, enhanced both BLVp and CMVp activity. Conclusion Based on these data, we conclude the BLV promoter could be very useful for transgene expression in mammalian <b>expression</b> <b>vectors.</b> </p...|$|R
