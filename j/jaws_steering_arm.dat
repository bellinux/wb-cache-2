40|$|Abstract. Different process {{steps of}} the {{workpiece}} have different effects on the microstructure in the multi-stage forging. In this study, the effect of four different process steps of <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> on microstructure was studied by FEM. Results have showed that upsetting is beneficial to refine the microstructure as well as finish forging. Especially drawing can make the distribution of microstructure homogeneous while bending has less effect on it. The already-designed forging process for <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> was reasonable based on the simulation. Eventually, the grain size level of the <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> was tested as 6. 5 based on the conventional standard...|$|R

40|$|In this study, 2 DOF {{mathematical}} {{models of}} Pitman <b>arm</b> <b>steering</b> system are derived using Newton’s law of motion and modeled in MATLAB/SIMULINK software. The developed steering model is included with a DC motor model which is directly {{attached to the}} steering column. The Pitman <b>arm</b> <b>steering</b> model is then validated with actual Pitman <b>arm</b> <b>steering</b> test rig using various lateral inputs such as double lane change, step steer, and slalom test. Meanwhile, a position tracking control method {{has been used in}} order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the validated model to be implemented in active safety system of a heavy vehicle. The similar method has been used to test the actual Pitman <b>arm</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism using hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS) technique. Additional friction compensation is added in the HILS technique in order to minimize the frictional effects that occur in the mechanical configuration of the DC motor and Pitman <b>arm</b> <b>steering.</b> The performance of the electronically actuated Pitman <b>arm</b> <b>steering</b> system can be used to develop a firing-on-the-move actuator (FOMA) for an armored vehicle. The FOMA can be used as an active safety system to reject unwanted yaw motion due to the firing force...|$|R

The race was completed with yellow flags in the second sector as Boardman's car was stranded on the racing line. Repairs meant he had to start from the pit lane for race two.|$|R
50|$|Many modern cars use {{rack and}} pinion {{steering}} mechanisms, where the steering wheel turns the pinion gear; the pinion moves the rack, which is a linear gear that meshes with the pinion, converting circular motion into linear motion along the transverse axis of the car (side to side motion). This motion applies steering torque to the swivel pin ball joints that replaced previously used kingpins of the stub axle of the steered wheels via tie rods and a short lever <b>arm</b> called the <b>steering</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We present designs, theory, {{and results}} of {{fabrication}} and testing for a novel parallel microrobotic assembly scheme using stress-engineered MEMS microrobots. The robots are 240 − 280 µm × 60 µm × 7 − 20 µm insizeandcanbecontrolled to dock compliantly together, forming planar structures several times this size. The devices are classified into species {{based on the}} design of their <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> actuators, and the species are further classified as independent if they can be maneuvered independently using a single global control signal. In this paper, we show that microrobot species are independent if the two transition voltages of their <b>steering</b> <b>arms,</b> i. e., the voltages at which the arms are raised or lowered, form a unique pair. We present control algorithms that can be applied to groups of independent microrobot species to direct their motion from arbitrary nondeadlock configurations to desired planar microassemblies. We present designs and fabrication for four independent microrobot species, each with a unique transition voltage. The fabricated microrobots are used to demonstrate directed assembly of five types of planar structures from two classes of initial conditions. We demonstrate an average docking accuracy of 5 µm and use self-aligning compliant interaction between the microrobots to further align and stabilize the intermediate assemblies. The final assemblies match their target shapes on average 96 %, by area.

40|$|Subjected to {{the dynamic}} loading, truck {{components}} {{are exposed to}} fatigue loading. Hence the methods to improve the fatigue properties of the components are widely employed by manufacturers. One of the well known methods in this field is shot peening. Shot peening introduces compressive residual stresses in the surface zones and changes the work hardening state there. Compressive residual stresses provide higher resistance to crack initiation and may postpone the crack propagation. However the surface roughness is considerably increased by shot peening, {{which of course is}} not favourable for the fatigue durability. <b>Steering</b> <b>arm</b> as a truck component is the subject of present study. This component may be made of two different materials: medium carbon microalloyed steel or quenched and tempered steel. The former is continuously cooled leading to pearlitic-ferritic microstructure and the latter has a tempered martensite microstructure. Although the pearlitic-ferritic <b>steering</b> <b>arm</b> made of microalloyed steel is the main focus of this study, the tempered martensite microstructure was also investigated to a certain extent. Strain controlled, constant amplitude push-pull fatigue tests at different strain amplitudes were performed on cylindrical specimens. The specimens were machined out of the microalloyed steel <b>steering</b> <b>arms.</b> The specimens then were tested in two groups: one group in mirror finished condition and the other group in shot peened condition. The results showed that the life time of specimens at higher strain levels (higher plastic strain amplitudes) is not effected by shot peening. However at smaller plastic strain amplitudes the peened specimens exhibit a life time at least one order of magnitude longer than unpeened specimens. The residual stress relaxation and changes of work hardening state were also monitored at the surface and in depth for different strain amplitudes. The influence of plastic strain amplitude on relaxation of residual stresses was studied in detail as a function of fatigue cycle number. The fatigue behaviour in bending, including relaxation, was also studied for the tempered martensitic steel with different degrees of decarburisation and subsequent shot peening. Also in this case a positive influence of shot peening is mainly seen at small strain amplitudes. In parallel whole components were also tested in constant and variable amplitude loading fatigue, with and without shot peening. The results here also show a longer life time for the peened components...|$|R
