In this paper, the writer proposes a unique way {{to obtain the}} spatial coordinates of the features of kiwi fruit from the bottom of the target fruit based on the growth characteristics and scaffolding cultivation pattern characteristics of kiwi fruit, plus the help of Microsoft camera and Kinect sensor. Also included in this paper is the coordinate conversion between the images come from Microsoft camera and the images of the Kinect sensor, which is followed by an analysis of the precision of the spatial coordinates of Kiwi fruit captured by the Microsoft camera and Kinect sensor. The process is like this: first, capture images of the target fruit from the bottom of the fruit with Microsoft camera, and then extract coordinates of the target fruits’ feature points to determine the corresponding target fruit feature point coordinates in the Kinect sensor; second, analyze the correspondence between the Microsoft camera <b>image</b> <b>coordinate</b> system and the Kinect sensor <b>image</b> <b>coordinate</b> system so as to establish a mathematical model for the <b>image</b> <b>coordinate</b> conversion; finally, capture target feature points’ spatial coordinates with Kinect sensor and conduct tests.

40|$|In this paper, an {{efficient}} global optimization algorithm {{in the field}} of artificial intelligence, named Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), is introduced into close range photogrammetric data processing. PSO can be applied to obtain the approximate values of exterior orientation elements under the condition that multi-intersection photography and a small portable plane control frame are used. PSO, put forward by an American social psychologist J. Kennedy and an electrical engineer R. C. Eberhart, is a stochastic global optimization method based on swarm intelligence, which was inspired by social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling. The strategy of obtaining the approximate values of exterior orientation elements using PSO is as follows: in terms of <b>image</b> <b>coordinate</b> observed values and space coordinates of few control points, the equations of calculating the <b>image</b> <b>coordinate</b> residual errors can be given. The sum of absolute value of each <b>image</b> <b>coordinate</b> is minimized to be the objective function. The difference between <b>image</b> <b>coordinate</b> observed value and the <b>image</b> <b>coordinate</b> computed through collinear condition equation is defined as the <b>image</b> <b>coordinate</b> residual error. Firstly a gross area of exterior orientation elements is given, and then the adjustment of other parameters is made to get the particles fly in the gross area. After iterative computation for certain times, the satisfied approximate values of exterior orientation elements are obtained. By doing so, the procedures like positioning and measuring space control points in close range photogrammetry can be avoided. Obviously, this method can improve the surveying efficiency greatly {{and at the same time}} can decrease the surveying cost. And during such a process, only one small portable control frame with a couple of control points is employed, and there are no strict requirements for the space distribution of control points. In order to verify the effectiveness of this algorithm, two experiments are carried out. In the first experiment, images of a standard grid board are taken according to multi-intersection photography using digital camera. Three points or six points which are located on the left-down corner of the standard grid are regarded as control points respectively, and the exterior orientation elements of each image are computed through PSO, and compared with these elements computed through bundle adjustment. In the second experiment, the exterior orientation elements obtained from the first experiment are used as approximate values in bundle adjustment and then the space coordinates of other grid points on the board can be computed. The coordinate difference of grid points between these computed space coordinates and their known coordinates can be used to compute the accuracy. The point accuracy computed in above experiments are ± 0. 76 mm and ± 0. 43 mm respectively. The above experiments prove the effectiveness of PSO used in close range photogrammetry to compute approximate values of exterior orientation elements, and the algorithm can meet the requirement of higher accuracy. In short, PSO can get better results in a faster, cheaper way compared with other surveying methods in close range photogrammetry...|$|R
