5|$|During the Great Depression, {{unemployment}} exceeded 25% statewide. Southern Indiana {{was hard}} hit, and unemployment topped 50% during the worst years. The federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) began operations in Indiana in July 1935. By October of that year, {{the agency had}} put 74,708 Hoosiers to work. In 1940, there were still 64,700 people working for agency. The majority of these workers were employed to improve the state's infrastructure: roads, bridges, flood control projects, and water treatment plants. Some helped index collections of libraries, and artists were employed to create murals for post offices and libraries. Nearly <b>every</b> <b>community</b> had a project to work on.|$|E
5|$|In 1282, Edward I of England {{conquered the}} principality of Wales and divided the area into counties. One of {{thirteen}} traditional counties in Wales, Cardiganshire {{was also a}} vice-county. Cardiganshire was split into the five hundreds of Genau'r-Glyn, Ilar, Moyddyn, Penarth and Troedyraur. In the 18th century there was an evangelical revival of Christianity, and non-conformism became established in the county as charismatic preachers like Daniel Rowland of Llangeitho attracted large congregations. <b>Every</b> <b>community</b> built its own chapel or meeting house, and Cardiganshire {{became one of the}} centres of Methodism in Wales with the Aeron Valley being at the centre of the revival.|$|E

Since 1689 it has had a Presbyterian system of church government, and enjoys independence from the state. Its membership is 398,389, about 7.5% of the total population, though according to the 2014 Scottish Annual Household Survey, 27.8%, or 1.5 million adherents, identified Church of Scotland as their religion. The Church operates a territorial parish structure, with <b>every</b> <b>community</b> in Scotland having a local congregation.|$|E

25|$|The Kirk is {{committed}} to its 'distinctive call and duty to bring the ordinances of religion {{to the people in}} every parish of Scotland through a territorial ministry' (Article 3 of its Articles Declaratory). This means the Kirk in practice maintains a presence in <b>every</b> <b>community</b> in Scotland, and exists to serve not only its members but all Scots (most funerals in Scotland are presided by its ministers). The Kirk also pools its resources to ensure continuation of this presence.|$|E

25|$|The {{autonomous}} communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy, {{with their own}} parliaments and regional governments. The distribution of powers may be different for <b>every</b> <b>community,</b> as laid out in their Statutes of Autonomy, since devolution {{was intended to be}} asymmetrical. Only two communities—the Basque Country and Navarre—have full fiscal autonomy. Aside of fiscal autonomy, the nationalities—Andalusia, the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Galicia—were devolved more powers {{than the rest of the}} communities, among them the ability of the regional president to dissolve the parliament and call for elections at any time. In addition, the Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarre have police corps of their own: Ertzaintza, Mossos d'Esquadra and the Policía Foral respectively. Other communities have more limited forces or none at all, like the Policía Autónoma Andaluza in Andalusia or the BESCAM in Madrid.|$|E

State leaders were determined that this boom would not end like the fur and gold booms, {{in an economic}} bust {{as soon as the}} resource had disappeared. In 1976, the state's constitution was amended to establish the Alaska Permanent Fund, in which a quarter of all mineral lease proceeds is invested. Income from the fund is used to pay annual dividends to all residents who qualify, to increase the fund's principal as a hedge against inflation, and to provide funds for the state legislature. Since 1993, the fund has produced more money than the Prudhoe Bay oil fields, whose production is diminishing. , the fund's value was over $30 billion.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, the Canadian {{government}} {{funded the}} establishment of secular, government-operated {{high schools in the}} Northwest Territories (including what is now Nunavut) and Inuit areas in Quebec and Labrador along with the residential school system. The Inuit population was not large enough to support a full high school in <b>every</b> <b>community,</b> so this meant only a few schools were built, and students from across the territories were boarded there. These schools, in Aklavik, Iqaluit, Yellowknife, Inuvik and Kuujjuaq, brought together young Inuit from across the Arctic in one place for the first time, and exposed them to the rhetoric of civil and human rights that prevailed in Canada in the 1960s. This was a real wake-up call for the Inuit, and it stimulated {{the emergence of a new}} generation of young Inuit activists in the late 1960s who came forward and pushed for respect for the Inuit and their territories.|$|E
