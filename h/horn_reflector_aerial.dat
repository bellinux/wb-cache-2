An intense νμ beam {{is generated}} at CERN and directed towards LNGS (Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso) in Italy where ντ will be detected in large and complex detectors. An {{overview of the}} CNGS beam facility is given. Results from the primary and secondary beam line commission-ing performed in summer 2006 are presented. Measure-ments of proton beam parameters are compared with ex-pectations. CNGS OVERVIEW Neutrino beams at accelerators are generated from the decay of mesons, mostly π and K, through π+(−) → μ+(−) + νμ(ν̄μ) and K+(−) → μ+(−) + νμ(ν̄μ). For the CNGS facility [1, 2, 3], these mesons are produced from a high intensity 400 GeV proton beam extracted from the SPS, transported through a 840 m beam line, before im-pinging on a graphite target. The positively charged π /K are energy-selected and guided with two focusing lenses (<b>horn,</b> <b>reflector)</b> in the direction towards Gran Sasso. In the 1000 m long decay vacuum tube, these particles decay into muon-neutrinos and muons. All the remaining unwanted particles are stopped by a hadron stop located {{at the end of}} the decay tunnel. Two muon detector stations are then used to derive the intensity and profile of the neutrino beam pro-duced. The main components of CNGS are schematically shown in Figure 1. Proto...|$|R
40|$|This book is {{intended}} as an advanced text for courses in antennas, {{with a focus}} on the mature but vital background field of aperture antennas. The book is aimed at final year, MSc, PhD and Post-Doctoral students, as well as readers who are moving from academia into industry, beginning careers as wireless engineers, system designers, in R&D, or for practising engineers. It assumes the reader has undertaken an earlier course of study on Maxwell's equations, fields and waves. Some of these topics are summarised in the early few chapters in order to provide continuity and background for the remaining chapters. The aperture antennas covered include the main types of <b>horns,</b> <b>reflectors</b> and arrays as well as microstrip patches, reflectarrays and lenses. To provide more than a superficial treatment of arrays, the topic of mutual coupling is covered in greater detail than most similar books in the area. Also included is an introduction to arrays on non-planar surfaces, which is of importance for applications that involve curved surfaces such as in aerodynamics or for making aperture antennas unobtrusive. A chapter is included on some modern aperture antennas to illustrate design techniques beyond the most common types of aperture antennas described in the early chapters. This is to show where advances have recently been made and where they could be improved in the future. Also included are selected topics of a practical nature for aperture antennas, namely fabrication and measurement. 430 page(s...|$|R

Edge diffraction methods are discussed in detail and {{form the basis of}} the theoretical analysis. Comparisons are made with other methods where applicable. The particular antennas considered are pyramidal horns, sectoral horns, and circularly symmetric paraboloidal reflectors illuminated by a source at the focus.

40|$|An {{effective}} {{technique to}} the design of dual band coaxial waveguide feed <b>horn</b> for <b>reflector</b> antenna excitation has been developed and tested. Matching the feed horn with free space in upper frequency range is achieved by dielectric insert disposed inside the circular waveguide fabricated in interior conductor of open ended coaxial waveguide. The presence of dielectric insert causes the high level of reflection in lower frequency range from the boundary between the open end of coaxial waveguide and free space. A novel technical solution of highly complicated matching problem has been proposed. The matching design was performed as the series of finite thickness diaphragm arranged on outer surface of interior conductor of coaxial waveguide. To obtain the rigorous solution of given electromagnetic problem for the complicated structure consisting of a great number of connected coaxial waveguide sections and dielectric insert, a new effective approach has been proposed. The distinctive feature of this approach consists in combination of rigorous procedure based on computation of generalized scattering matrices and another rigorous procedure based on the finite difference time domain method. To combine these essentially different approaches, the metallic discontinuity equivalent to overall investigated structure was employed. An optimization of equivalent matching structure has been performed by the variant of the evolution strategy method. The obtained design with metallic discontinuities was converted into real structure comprising the dielectric insert. The final calculations of real structure were performed by the finite difference time domain method. The effectiveness of proposed technique was confirmed by the results of testing the developed feed <b>horn</b> in <b>reflector</b> antenna system...|$|R

To create a high gain antenna, which radiates radio waves in a narrow beam, two general techniques can be used. One technique is to use large metal surfaces such as parabolic <b>reflectors,</b> <b>horns</b> or dielectric lenses which change {{the direction of the}} radio waves by reflection or refraction, to focus the radio waves from a single low gain antenna into a beam.

50|$|This type of antenna {{is called}} a Hogg or {{horn-reflector}} antenna, invented by Alfred C. Beck and Harald T. Friis in 1941. It was built by David C. Hogg. It consists of a flaring metal horn with a curved reflecting surface mounted in its mouth, at a 45° angle to the long axis of the <b>horn.</b> The <b>reflector</b> is a segment of a parabolic reflector, so the antenna is really a parabolic antenna which is fed off-axis. A Hogg horn combines several characteristics useful for radio astronomy. It is extremely broad-band, has calculable aperture efficiency, and {{the walls of the}} horn shield it from radiation coming from angles outside the main beam axis. The back and side lobes are therefore so minimal that scarcely any thermal energy is received from the ground. Consequently, it is an ideal radio telescope for accurate measurements of low levels of weak background radiation. The antenna has a gain of about 43.3 dBi and a beamwidth of about 1.5° at 2.39 GHz and an aperture efficiency of 76%.|$|R

The change was originally produced by fixing an angled metal plate on part of the parabolic <b>reflector</b> of the <b>aerial,</b> as may be seen in the picture of the aerial on a Halifax bomber.

Thus the horn operates as a square pyramidal horn at the low band and as a traditional multimode horn in the upper band.

The dual-depth corrugated horn is fed by a circular and a coaxial waveguide, {{in the upper}} and lower frequency band, respectively. The reason for choosing a waveguide-only feeding network is discussed. Predicted and measured data are compared and the numerical design procedure, including optimization, is presented. Based on measured <b>horn</b> radiation patterns, <b>reflector</b> antenna patterns are calculated and system performance is estimated. The Arecibo Gregorian dual-reflector feed performance is analyzed. A cluster feed geometry is studied with respect to field of view performance. It is shown that, using a sub-optimal (high spillover) element geometry, a seven-element cluster feed with good performance for all seven beams can be realized. Physical optics calculations are used to verify the performance of the dual-reflector feed which was designed using geometrical optics. Numerical waveguide simulators are easy to implement and can model non-physical boundary conditions. A number of different periodic structures are analyzed with a numerical waveguide simulator. The calculated data are compared to results computed using other numerical methods, with good agreement. Effective electromagnetic material parameters of infinite periodic structures consisting of two separate homogeneous materials are studied. The analysis provide effective dielectric constants of various geometries. It shown that transmission line solutions agree well with rigorous three-dimensional solutions, for periods less than half a wavelength.
