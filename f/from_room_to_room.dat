5|$|On 20 September, German General Otto Liman von Sanders, the {{commander}} of the Yildirim Army Group, ordered Samakh's German and Ottoman garrison to prepare a strong rearguard defence of the town. By dawn on 25 September, when a regiment and two squadrons of the Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade attacked Samakh, the rearguard was strongly entrenched. The assault, which began with a mounted cavalry charge, ended two hours later after close quarter fighting in the village and the railway station. After fierce fighting with bayonets and swords, <b>from</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> in the railway buildings, the town was captured. This victory, which captured the centre of the rearguard line, concluded the Battle of Sharon section of the Battle of Megiddo and opened the way for the cavalry pursuit to Damascus, which was captured on 1 October. By the time the Armistice of Mudros between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire was signed at the end of October, Aleppo had been captured and fighting was in progress further north.|$|E

25|$|In 1833, de Montferrand {{was hired}} to {{redesign}} the eastern state rooms and create the Field Marshal's Hall and the Small Throne Room (9 & 10). In 1837, a fire broke out. Its cause is unknown, but its spread is blamed on de Montferrand. The architect was being hurried by the Tsar for an early completion, so he used wooden materials where stone would have been better. Additionally, between the hurriedly built wooden partition walls disused fireplaces were concealed; their chimneys, coupled with the narrow ventilation shafts, acted as flues for the fire, allowing it to spread undetected between the walls <b>from</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> {{until it was too}} late to extinguish.|$|E

500|$|West, who had {{previously}} recorded at Avex for 808s & Heartbreak, block-booked the studio's three session rooms simultaneously for 24 {{hours a day to}} work on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. According to Noah Callahan-Bever, who visited West during the recording sessions, [...] "when he hits a creative wall... he heads to another studio room to make progress on another song". West never slept a full night at the [...] "glass-enclosed mansion" [...] house he had rented, opting instead to take power naps in a studio chair or couch 90 minutes at a time. Engineers worked around the clock, as West bounced <b>from</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>room.</b> This assiduous work ethic led to West employing two private chefs, one for hot food, and one for cold food.Before recording in the afternoon, West and most of his crew played games of 21 against locals at the Honolulu YMCA for leisure. Kid Cudi smoked marijuana in preparation and worked out on a treadmill, while RZA worked out in the weight room. West held breakfast each morning at his Diamond Head residence for his crew.|$|E

Both would arrive {{in the morning at}} Robert Lang Studios, start production by noon and do four songs a day. According to Grohl, during the recording process he would run <b>from</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>room,</b> [...] "still sweating and shaking from playing drums and [...] pick up the guitar and put down a track, do the bass, maybe another guitar part, have a sip of coffee and then go in and do the next song". The only performance by an outsider was a guitar part on [...] "X-Static" [...] provided by Greg Dulli of The Afghan Whigs, who was watching Grohl record the songs. Grohl eventually asked him if he wanted to play and handed him a guitar. Each song took about 45 minutes to be completed, and the compositions were recorded in the same order that became the album's track listing. The only song that required two run-throughs before completion was [...] "I'll Stick Around". Grohl was insecure about his singing, and added effects to his voice in [...] "Floaty", and tried to enhance the performance through double track – [...] "You know how people double their vocals to make them stronger? That album the vocals are quadrupled." ...|$|E
500|$|Whedon used {{a variety}} of cinematographic {{techniques}} to achieve the dreamlike quality of [...] "Restless". He used tracking shots with a Steadicam to follow the characters from place to place, creating a flow in the way of real dreams, where there are no logical connections between places and things. In Giles' dream, he walks from a carnival grounds into Spike's crypt, then through a corridor and straight into The Bronze, three locations not related to one another. Whedon was able to do this by simply having actor Anthony Stewart Head walk through the sets as they were built; this effortlessly created a sense of dreamlike dislocation. Another example of this occurs when, in Xander's dream, he walks {{from the front of the}} moving ice cream van towards the back, crawls up and over some boxes, through a window, and drops into his basement. In the theater scene during Willow's dream, a Frazier lens was used to provide a large depth of field, allowing both the foreground and background to be in focus at the same time, while in Xander's dream, as he moves <b>from</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> in Buffy's house to the university dorm rooms, Whedon used a 17mm lens to give a sense of motion as the camera passes by walls. Whedon also used unusual framing for shots, often leaving much of the frame empty, with a character being placed near the bottom or off to the side. The scenes in Spike's crypt, part of Giles' dream, were shot in black-and-white to emphasize that Spike is seen as [...] "an old 30s movie villain".|$|E

40|$|A passive {{dehumidifier}} system utilizing charcoal chips {{produced from}} construction wastes was proposed. The most {{important point is}} that the system contains a regenerating cycle for vapor absorbed charcoal chips, which was comes form an expanded idea on Trombe Wall System. The system consists of a charcoal chips board, which is externally covered by a glass skin with a small air space. There are two ventilation paths either <b>from</b> a <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> or <b>from</b> an outside air to outside, which may be supported by mechanical fans. The former path is for the dehumidifying mode, when the charcoal chips board effectively absorbs room air vapor. Whereas, the latter is for the regenerating mode during daytime, when the solar radiation can restore the charcoal chips board. The authors established a numerical model of this system on a basis of the simultaneous hygrothermal transfer equations. Obtained numerical result shows a practical feasibility of the system and helps for a primary design under various situations...|$|R

2500|$|In 1838, Njegoš hosted Saxon King Frederick Augustus II, a keen naturalist who {{had come}} to Montenegro to study the country's diverse flora. The king was housed at the Cetinje Monastery, and Njegoš was forced to move <b>from</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>room</b> to {{accommodate}} him. Displeased by this state of affairs, and irritated by German press reports that described Montenegro as [...] "primitive", Njegoš ordered the construction of a secular dwelling that was to serve as both a royal palace and seat of government. Designed by Ozeretskovsky, the residence was a long, two-storied stone building with twenty-five rooms nestled behind a fortified wall and flanked by defensive towers at all four corners. Located just northeast of the Cetinje Monastery, and facing east towards Constantinople, it was soon dubbed the Biljarda, after the central room on the second floor which contained a billiard table that Njegoš had ordered transported to Montenegro from the Adriatic coast. The residence was within view of an unfinished stone watchtower intended to protect the monastery from cannon fire and whose construction had begun five years earlier, in 1833. When Njegoš realized that its location was unsuitable for a fortress, he ordered that its construction be abandoned, and it was converted into a tower where the heads of decapitated Turkish warriors were impaled on spears and left exposed to the elements. Turkish heads had previously been impaled beside the monastery walls. Dubbed the Tablja, the tower was meant to rival Ali Pasha's citadel in Mostar, where the severed heads of four to five Serbs were displayed at any given time. John Gardner Wilkinson, an English traveler and Egyptologist, saw the Tablja while visiting Cetinje in 1844. He noted the [...] "acrid stench" [...] that the structure exuded and recalled how dogs would tear pieces of flesh and bone away from the rotting heads and drag them across Cetinje. Wilkinson met with both Njegoš and Ali Pasha on separate occasions {{over the course of his}} travels and attempted to persuade them to cease beheading their prisoners. Njegoš agreed in principle, but maintained that ceasing to sever the heads of Turkish warriors would be perceived as [...] "weakness" [...] and serve only to invite attack. Ali Pasha objected along similar lines and said that he doubted the good faith of the Montenegrins, whom he claimed were known for their [...] "wanton cruelty".|$|E

There was the long gallery, with its rows of respectable and (though, of course, one couldn't publicly admit it) rather boring Italian primitives, its Chinese sculptures, its unobtrusive, dateless furniture. There was the panelled drawing-room, where the huge chintz-covered arm-chairs stood, oases of comfort among the austere flesh-mortifying antiques. There was the morning-room, with its pale lemon walls, its painted Venetian chairs and rococo tables, its mirrors, its modern pictures. There was the library, cool, spacious, and dark, book-lined from floor to ceiling, rich in portentous folios. There was the dining-room, solidly, portwinily English, with its great mahogany table, its eighteenth-century chairs and sideboard, its eighteenth-century pictures--family portraits, meticulous animal paintings. What could one reconstruct from such data? There was much of Henry Wimbush in the long gallery and the library, something of Anne, perhaps, in the morning-room. That was all.
