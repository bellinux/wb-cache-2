30|$|FMD’s {{pathophysiology}} remains unclear. Some authors {{suggest a}} {{role played by}} <b>estrogenic</b> <b>impregnation</b> given the female predominance. The predominance of right renal artery lesions suggests a mechanical component because the right kidney is more mobile than the left one; the mechanism may involve compression of the vasa vasorum leading to ischaemia. The vasa vasorum are small blood vessels that wind along arteries whose calibres are larger than 1  mm. They feed the adventitia and the external two-thirds of the media. There are relatively few in the carotid and renal arteries, possibly a feature of FMD [13]. Smoking {{could also be a}} risk factor. Autosomal dominant transmission with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity is suggested in 6 – 10  % familial types; no specific gene has been identified, though [17]. Moreover, a study performed over 9  years in 106 patients who had repeated angiograms showed either a progression or a stabilisation of FMD lesions but no lesion regression was seen [9].|$|E
