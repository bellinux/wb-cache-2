5|$|The radical faction around Nicolae Bălcescu and Gheorghe Magheru {{had planned}} {{resistance}} on the Danube, but their opinion {{had failed to}} rally significant appeal. A group of several thousands soldiers, comprising Oltenian pandurs and volunteers from throughout the land, rallied in Râmnicu Vâlcea under Magheru's command, without <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> into action. In Bucharest itself, as Fuat prepared to lead his 6000 troops into the garrison on Dealul Spirii, a 900-strong force led by a detachment of firemen met him with resistance, provoking a brief battle that only lasted {{two and a half}} hours during which 158 Turks and 48 Romanians died and 400 Turks and 57 Romanians were wounded. In the evening, the entire city had been pacified. On September 27, a Russian force under Alexander von Lüders joined the occupation of Bucharest, taking over administration over one half of the city. Russia's expedition into the two Danubian Principalities was the only independent military initiative of her foreign interventions against the Revolutions of 1848.|$|E

25|$|Allan Frederick Tinsdale White (5 September 1915 – 16 March 1993) was an English amateur cricketer: a {{right-handed}} batsman {{who played}} for both Warwickshire and Worcestershire, captaining the latter county between 1947 and 1949, though sharing the captaincy with Bob Wyatt {{in the last of}} those three seasons. He also played for Cambridge University, as well as making a single appearance for Free Foresters. Curiously, he passed fifty 26 times without <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> on to score a century.|$|E
25|$|The film {{is notable}} for its avant-garde style, shot on stark high-contrast {{black-and-white}} film, using the spherical cinematographic process with allusions to French New Wave cinema. The striking black-and-white photography of the film's cinematographer, Stephen H. Burum, lies in two main sources: the films of Orson Welles and German cinema of the 1920s. When {{the film was}} in its pre-production phase, Coppola asked Burum how he wanted to film it and they agreed {{that it might be}} the only chance they were <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> {{to have to make a}} black-and-white film.|$|E

25|$|President Menem {{had already}} privatized the state telecom concern and {{national}} airlines (the once-premier airline in Latin America, Aerolíneas Argentinas, which was later almost {{run into the}} ground). The stability Cavallo's plan helped bring about, however, opened prospects for more privatizations than <b>ever.</b> <b>Going</b> on to total over 200 state enterprises, these included: the costly state railroads concern, the state oil monopoly YPF, several public utilities, two government television stations, 10,000km (6000mi) of roads, steel and petrochemical firms, grain elevators, hotels, subways and even racetracks. A panoply of provincial and municipal banks were sold to financial giants abroad (sometimes over the opposition of their respective governors and mayors) and, taking {{a page from the}} Chile pension system privatization, the mandatory National Pension System was opened to choice through the authorization of private pension schemes.|$|E
25|$|Regarding state repressions, Stalin often {{provided}} conflicting signals. In May 1933, {{he ordered}} the release of many criminals convicted of minor offenses from the overcrowded prisons and ordered the security services not to enact further mass arrests and deportations. In September 1934, {{he ordered the}} Politburo to establish a commission to investigate any false imprisonments; however, that same month he called for the execution of workers at the Stalin Metallurgical Factory accused of spying for Japan. This began to change in December 1934, when the prominent party member Sergey Kirov was murdered. After the murder of Kirov, Stalin became increasingly attentive {{of the possibility of}} murder and subsequently improved his own personal security, including being heavily guarded at all times and rarely <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> out in public on his own.|$|E
25|$|Maas {{picked the}} league apart {{in his first}} year as a starter, and despite his late start was a West Division All-Star and the Edmonton nominee for CFL Outstanding Player. He threw 231 {{complete}} of 391 attempts for 3,646 yards, recording 21 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. His performance in the 2001 Labour Day Classic, when Maas was the offensive star and recorded a late 23-yard run to set up the winning field goal as time expired, made him an instant fan favourite. Maas led the Eskimos to first place in one of the weakest Western Divisions of all time, as the Esks won the division by winning only as many as they lost. The end of the year was sour as the Eskimos were blown out by the rival Calgary Stampeders in the Western Finals, 34–18. Maas emerged with little credit in the defeat, and after two straight years of disappointment, the local media were beginning to speculate whether the Eskimos were <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> to get past the Western Final.|$|E

25|$|Mandy and Adam {{were later}} shown the entire suicide note. Mandy reports that Adam {{immediately}} voiced {{that he did}} not see anything on the letter than indicated it was written by Daniel, and the note appeared to be 'cold' and 'matter-of-fact'. The note also stated 'don't blame the guy I was with last night'. When Mandy and Adam asked the Police if they had looked into who the note was referring to, the Police said they didn't know, may never know, and that they weren't <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> to find out all the answers. Mandy reported that in hindsight, she doesn't feel Dagenham Police were investigating properly, and they wouldn't have had to look very far to find out Port was behind it, and save another family from emotional turmoil. When Mandy wished to challenge the open verdict or continue investigation, she reported that she was told that nothing more could be done, and she felt there was an attitude of 'it is what it is, deal with it'.|$|E
