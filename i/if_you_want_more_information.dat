All of these doctoral students will be ready to serve on your faculty starting in Fall 2016. We at Berkeley are proud of the rigorous conceptual mentoring our students receive and how they have each drawn extensively on the larger intellectual assets of the world's leading public university. They have conducted research, many have published in leading journals, and most have taught undergraduate and/or graduate students to positive evaluations. Each one of these emerging scholars will bring a unique set of skills to your school, both in scholarly pursuits and in their ability to shape future leaders among their students. We hope you read the attached curriculum vitae carefully.

40|$|Dear reader, My {{thesis is}} a {{reflection}} of my internship from August until the end of December 2007 at EDU-ART, an organisation for culture education (office: Arnhem). This internship was my Final Project for my Master Renaissance Studies. What did I do at EDU-ART? A castle, called Kasteel Huis Bergh, asked EDU-ART to help developing an educational programme for children {{in the first two years}} of secondary school. The programme should be about the portrait collection of Huis Bergh. So I was asked to develop this programme from the orientation phase until the production and test phase. I talked with the personnel of Huis Bergh, with teachers and with my colleagues. In this way I could develop a programme that satisfied Huis Bergh, EDU-ART ánd the children! My reflection contains several documents. The description of every file explains which part of the reflection this file contains. I couldn't publish the programme itself here. So <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> you can always send an e-mail to info@edu-art. eu and ask your question. You may mention my name.

40|$|A {{requirement}} of {{this course is}} that the students experiment with a random matrix problem that is of interest to them. Often these explorations take {{the shape of a}} little bit of theory {{and a little bit of}} computational experimentation. Some of you might already have some ideas that are relevant to your current research. Regardless, we thought we’d put together some ideas for projects. Feel free to adapt them based on your interests; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> about a particular idea, please feel to contact us. Mid-term project presentations are tentatively scheduled for October 28 th and November 2 nd as indicated on the course calendar. We will provide more details about this in a subsequent email to the class. The basic purpose of this mid-term project is to get your feet wet thinking about a problem that is of interest to you using the tools you’ve learned about so far or to learn new tools for that purpose. 1 Covariance Matrices in Signal Processing Sample covariance matrices come up in many signal processing applications such as adaptive filtering.

40|$|Slight {{change in}} {{information}} given: {{in the past}} I have provided price and ISBN numbers of books. The notion of price is ill-defined: the website www. bestbookbuys. com gives a range of prices from place to puchase books on the web. (amazon. com is usually not the cheapest, and its usually not even close.). Providing ISBN numbers is also not needed in this electronic age where such information {{is available at the}} touch of a button. If the price is notable – either rather high or rather low, this might be mentioned in the review. Welcome to the Book Reviews Column. We hope to bring you at least two reviews of books every month. In this column four books are reviewed. 1. Data Structures and Algorithms in Java (2 nd ed) by Michael T Goodrich and Roberto Tamassia. Review by Hassan Masum. This is a textbook for a sophmore course on data structures and algorithms using Java as its base language. This is not just a standard data structures book translated into Java — this should be viewed as a book on object-oriented data structures. 2. Selected Papers on Analysis of Algorithms by Donald E. Knuth. Review by Timothy H. McNicholl. This is a collection of papers by Donald Knuth on the Analysis of Algorithms. The papers take the reader through a large variety of mathematical techniques in a motivated way. 3. How to Solve It: Modern Heuristics by Zbigniew Michalewicz and David B Fogel. Review by Hassan Masum. This book presents an overview of several problem solving techniques including search-methods, evolutionary computation, and fuzzy systems. 4. Proof, Language, and Interaction: Essays in Honour of Robin Milner Edited by Plotkin, Stirling and Tofte. Review by Riccardo Pucella. This is a collection of essay about the work of Robin Milner. The essays are on semantic foundations, programming logic, programming languages, concurrency, and mobility. I am looking for reviewers for the following books If you want a FREE copy of one of these books in exchange for a review, then email me at gasarchcs. umd. edu <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> about any of these books, again, feel free to email me.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore—from a {{managerial}} perspective—how IT-enabled change is designed, led, and sustained from-within an organisation. This {{is an issue of}} central concern because there is a considerable lack of research that directly incorporates IT in management and organisational change studies. In addition, earlier research has recurrently focused on abstract theorising, aggregated perspectives, and exploring organisational change from the outside, from-without. Consequently, the present body of research provides limited knowledge of how organisations in practice lead large-scale IT-enabled transformations. The thesis herein sets out to explore this question, and does so by following the change designers and agents of the telecommunications company Ericsson, that transformed its finance and accounting unit from a highly decentralised structure into a shared service centre structure (SSC) entitled: “The Global F&A Transformation Programme”. The formal transformation lasted three years, was enabled by an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, and was driven in the majority of Ericsson’s sub-units situated in more than 140 countries. Theoretically, this thesis addresses the research question: how do actors and structures influence large-scale IT-enabled change? The principal finding of the thesis is a four-stage analytical framework built on the concepts of common ground, common meaning, common interest, and common behaviour: The Commonality Framework for IT-enabled Change. The value of the framework is that it depicts the interplay between actors and structures on a micro-level. In doing so, the framework explains the different levels of complexity in a transformation and how they require different structures to be used, different activities to be performed, different skills to be applied, and different roles to be played. The framework can be used by both academics and practitioners to develop, assess, and improve IT-enabled change projects. In a broader perspective, the findings further suggest that change comes about as an upward spiral, within which the moving targets of IT and organisation are intimately interconnected. This reciprocal interconnectedness between IT and organisation across time implies that if changes are done to technological properties, this necessitates changes to the organisational properties, and vice versa. Organisations at the hands-on-level more or less have to change {{to make use of the}} IT-enabled advantages. Thus, successful IT-enabled change is more than the technology artefact per se, and requires thoughtful attentiveness not only to the technological and material side, but also to the organisational, social and human side of change. The theoretical contribution of this thesis is the in-depth exposition of different aspects and interplays between the properties of actors and structures from-within the organisation. The empirical contribution is the description of how contemporary multinational organisations initiate, lead, and sustain large-scale IT-enabled change. The provided document is only the summary and introductory chapter of the thesis (i. e. excluding the five papers). <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> about the thesis as a whole please contact the author einar. iveroth@fek. uu. se...|$|E
