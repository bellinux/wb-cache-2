Heylin writes that the lyrics [...] "revolve around 'dear, dear, dear, dear, Santa Fe'—intended to be both a woman's name and the town in New Mexico.

[...] Contrasting first-season episodes to those of the seventh season, Kenny said that [...] "there's a bit of a change , but I don't think it's that extreme at all." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{recording}} Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too, Alexander {{stated that}} he [...] "completely ripped up the rules that applied to [...] first two records." [...] While the album was credited to the New Radicals, it is often {{considered to be a}} Gregg Alexander album, as he wrote and produced most of its songs, played several instruments on it, and is the only constant member of the band. In reference to the wide variety of musicians he recruited to record the album, Alexander stated, [...] "Most of that record was me pulling favors with studios or musicians that had played on earlier records and were like, 'Oh, Gregg's down on his luck — let's go play on his demo <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> it, we'll have a good laugh, have a couple of beers and maybe smoke a jay or whatever.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the praise, some reviewers {{criticized the}} game for its {{confusing}} level layouts and felt they have not held up very well over the years. Christian Donlan of Eurogamer stated that Perfect Dark is [...] "not afraid to throw dead ends at you seemingly <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> it, or repeat textures so much in its huge maps {{that you can get}} a little dizzy." [...] GameSpot's Tom Mc Shea noted that the campaign was [...] "oddly paced", and that [...] "locked doors, unused rooms, and dead ends... can be disheartening to stumble around in a circle until you finally happen upon the correct door you just couldn't locate." [...] Nevertheless, he admitted that [...] "it's {{a lot of fun to}} replay them to try for high scores and figure out the many unique objectives." [...] He also remarked that that online play can periodically suffer from a significant amount of lag, but praised the amount of content and features.|$|E
500|$|De Laurentiis visited Ridley Scott {{on the set}} of Gladiator and {{suggested}} to Ridley he read the novel he had bought the rights to. Scott was in the third week before principal photography was due to finish on Gladiator. Gladiator became a commercial and critical success, earning 12 Academy Award nominations. De Laurentiis asked Scott if he would like to direct the film version of Hannibal. Scott misunderstood which Hannibal he meant, thinking De Laurentiis was speaking of the general and historical figure from Carthage who nearly brought down the Roman Empire back around 200 B.C., so he replied: [...] "Basically, Dino, I'm doing a Roman epic right now. I don't wanna do elephants coming over the Alps next, old boy." [...] Scott read the manuscript in four sittings within a week, believing it to be a [...] "symphony", and expressed his desire to do it. Scott further explains how he got involved: [...] "I was shooting Gladiator in Malta and one day, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> it, I went for a walk for half a mile down the road to the Malta Film Studio to see my old buddy Dino. I had not seen him since I'd worked on a version of Dune. This was pre-Blade Runner. Dino had pursued me to direct Dune and another film. He's always enthusiastic and aggressive and came after me when I did both Blade Runner and Alien, but I couldn't do the films. Anyway, we had an espresso together and a few days later, he called me to ask if he could visit the Gladiator set. He arrived with a manuscript of Hannibal, about a month before it was published in book form. He said: 'Let's make this one.' I haven't read anything so fast since The Godfather. It was so rich in all kind of ways." ...|$|E
