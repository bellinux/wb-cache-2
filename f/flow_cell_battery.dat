40|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} for the near future is our ability to generate and store energy. Though green technologies for energy generation such as solar and wind harvesting have been developed, their constant fluctuation in output requires a cost‐effective and efficient mode for storing the energy that is generated. The <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> <b>battery</b> was developed by NASA in the 1970 ’s and has recently garnered attention in Japan, Australia, and California for large scale energy storage. Flow Cell batteries were originally produced using Iron and Chromium compound electrolytes; however the relative abundance, multiple valence states, and low toxicity of Vanadium make it an excellent alternative candidate for an electrolyte. The current Vanadium Redox Batteries use Vanadium ions dissolved in sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, and one drawback is that the particles tend to aggregate in the filters of the batteries, which decreases lifetime. I plan to synthesize Vanadium nanostructures, such as nanowires, for use in these batteries with the hopes of increasing mass and electrical transport efficiency and preventing the buildup of particles within the devices...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the {{increase}} in penetration of wind power and its variable nature has begun to add considerable stress to and threatened {{the stability of the}} nation’s grid. In order to continue growth wind farms will need {{to have the ability to}} participate in the same grid frequency regulation as traditional generating sources. The goal of this research is to explore the use of energy storage devices to provide wind farms with a method to regulate their power output and the grid frequency. Using energy storage, this research aims to allow wind farms to participate in automatic generation control (AGC). Software simulations were performed to design an advanced energy storage controller that will allow maximum participation in AGC. A comprehensive in-lab grid was constructed to produce experimental results for this work and was used to evaluate the performance of the advanced energy storage controller. The first stage of this research aims to use super-capacitors to balance rapid excursions in frequency and wind power output while the second stage of this research will preliminarily explore the use of a zinc-bromine <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> <b>battery</b> for medium-scale, sustained excursions in frequency and wind power output.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Modern {{wind energy}} is the {{technology}} of choice with a short payback period for increasing renewable energy portfolios. Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), a United States power authority in the Pacific Northwest expects to increase their wind energy capacity from 2, 000 megawatts to 6, 000 megawatts {{within the next five}} years. Currently BPA uses their vast hydroelectric resources to counteract the variability of wind energy, but the control of hydroelectric power is somewhat limited by water and fish conditions on the Columbia River. As the integration of wind energy continues to increase, the variability of wind energy on the power system must be addressed. Large scale energy storage systems such as pumped hydro, compressed air, and <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> <b>batteries</b> are viable technologies to support high wind energy integration. This thesis presents a method for obtaining optimal energy capacity and power rating of an energy storage system for wind farm support...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} large scale energy storage {{has become a}} {{priority}} to integrate renewable energy sources into the electricity grid. Redox flow batteries are considered the best option to store electricity from medium to large scale applications. However, the current high cost of redox flow batteries impedes the wide spread adoption of this technology. The membrane is {{a critical component of}} redox flow batteries as it determines the performance as well as the economic viability of the batteries. The membrane acts as a separator to prevent cross-mixing of the positive and negative electrolytes, while still allowing the transport of ions to complete the circuit during the passage of current. An ideal membrane should have high ionic conductivity, low water intake and excellent chemical and thermal stability as well as good ionic exchange capacity. Developing a low cost, chemically stable membrane for redox <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> <b>batteries</b> has been a major focus for many groups around the world in recent years. This paper reviews the research work on membranes for redox flow batteries, in particular for the all-vanadium redox flow battery which has received the most attention...|$|R

40|$|The {{abruptly}} increased {{production of}} wind {{power in the}} Pacific Northwest has proved both a blessing and a curse for BPA: A blessing in its promise to abundantly supplement the PNW’s providential hydro resource; and the curse of its variable nature – on again, off again – which creates headaches for dispatching and greatly reduces system flexibility. An already topped-off transmission system can’t accommodate more wind input. The obvious solution is to somehow store that wind energy and conveniently {{return it to the}} system when needed. Equally obvious is that there is yet no satisfactory storage solution. This project aims to remedy that nagging situation: Using the in-lab grid at the Wallace Energy Systems & Renewables Facility (WESRF), research is being conducted on the ability of wind farms to participate in automatic generation control (AGC) through utilization of energy storage resources (super capacitors, <b>flow</b> <b>cell</b> <b>batteries,</b> pumped hydro, flywheels (simulated), and superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) (simulated)). Results already show that with the addition of energy storage resources, wind farms are able to participate in AGC. With such understanding will also come the ability to analyze the potential financial benefits of energy storage implementation and propose solutions to the problem...|$|R

40|$|The {{electrolyte}} separator is {{a significant}} component in redox <b>flow</b> <b>battery</b> <b>cell.</b> The function of this membrane is to separate positive and negative electrolyte solutions or other energy carrying species while allowing ionic connection between two half-cells. Ideally, the separator should have high conductivity to minimize ohmic loss, especially at high current density level. Low active species crossover is also desired to inhibit self-discharge and capacity loss. In addition, the separator’s stability is emphasized in the potentially extreme working environment of RFBs. Currently, a proton exchange membrane is one type of electrolyte separator used in RFB research.

40|$|Membranes are an {{important}} part of vanadium redox <b>flow</b> <b>battery</b> <b>cells.</b> Most cell designs use Naflon (R) -type membranes which are cation exchange membranes. Anion exchange membranes are reported to improve cell performance. A model for a vanadium redox flow battery with an anion exchange membrane is developed. The model is then used to calculate terminal voltages for open circuit and charge-discharge conditions. The results are compared to measured data from a laboratory test cell with 40 cm(2) active membrane area. For higher charge and discharge currents, an empirical correction for the terminal voltage is proposed. The model geometry comprises the porous electrodes and the connected pipes, allowing a study of the flow in the entrance region for different state-of-charges...|$|R

40|$|Compared to {{fuel cells}}, which possess similar <b>cell</b> architecture, <b>flow</b> <b>batteries</b> have poor performance. For example, {{conventional}} fuel cells can easily achieve current densities of 1. 5 A cm- 2 whereas the corresponding {{figure for the}} all vanadium flow battery (VFB) is {{an order of magnitude}} less, often less than 0. 2 A cm 2 [1]. Consequently, relatively large <b>flow</b> <b>battery</b> <b>cells</b> are required for a given power, increasing the cost of the technology. There are a few noticeable exceptions to the relatively poor performance of flow batteries, including the work of Zawodzinski et al. who achieved current densities in excess of 0. 8 A cm 2 with a VFB [2]. Most impressively, Weber and co-workers achieved current densities as high as 4 A cm 2 with a H 2 -Br 2 flow battery [3]. In both cases, the researchers used fuel cell components and fuel cell assembly techniques to minimize the cell ohmic resistance, particularly the contact resistance between the cell parts (electrodes, bipolar plates and current collectors). Typically, fuel cells are assembled using compression pressures of above 8 bar to minimize contact resistance. In comparison, flow batteries use compression pressures less than 1 bar during cell assembly with carbon fibre felt electrodes; hence contact resistance values are relatively high. A number of studies have measured the effect of felt compression on battery performance [4 - 5], where the felt compression is increased from 0 to 30...|$|R
