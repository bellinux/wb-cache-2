25|$|Malacca Zoo is {{the main}} zoo in the city metropolitan, {{featuring}} 215 species of birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians including the Sumatran rhinoceros, the Malayan gaur, Serow and the <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tiger.</b> An oceanarium located inside the Shore shopping malls complex features a variety of fish species and other sea creatures.|$|E
25|$|The zoo {{is highly}} {{proactive}} in species preservation and conservation efforts and participates in over 40 Species Survival Plans (SSP) with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The {{following is a}} list of the Species Survival Plans (SSP) that the zoo is involved with: addax, Chinese alligator, mandrill, bongo, kori bustard, fishing cat, cheetah, chimpanzee, Lake Victoria cichlids, Andean condor, wattled crane, African elephant, addra gazelle, white-cheeked gibbon, gorilla, great hornbill, rhinoceros hornbill, spectacled langur, ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemur, mona monkey, Allen's swamp monkey, Bali mynah, ocelot, okapi, Arabian oryx, scimitar-horned oryx, Oriental small-clawed otter, thick-billed parrot, African penguin, Mauritius pink pigeon, Aruba Island rattlesnake, black rhinoceros, Louisiana pine snake, black-handed spider monkey, cottontop tamarin, golden lion tamarin, <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tiger,</b> Sumatran tiger, Puerto Rican crested toad, radiated tortoise, Swainson's toucan, and Grevy's zebra.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{threat to}} <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tigers</b> is mankind. Humans hunt <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tigers</b> {{to make use}} of their body parts for adornments and various Eastern {{traditional}} medicines. <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tigers</b> are also facing habitat loss. Humans are encroaching upon their natural habitats, developing, fragmenting, and destroying the land. In Taiwan, a pair of tiger eyes, which are believed to fight epilepsy and malaria, can sell for as much as $170. In Seoul, powdered tiger humerus bone, which is believed to treat ulcers, rheumatism, and typhoid, sells for $1,450 per pound. In China, the trade and use of tiger parts was banned in 1993, but that has not stopped poachers who can earn as much as $50,000 from the sale of a single tiger’s parts on the black market. With a growing affluence in countries where tiger parts are so greatly valued, demand is high.|$|R
50|$|Wild animals {{found in}} the {{national}} park include gaur, deer, Muntiacus Muntjak, birds, <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tigers,</b> wild boars, red junglefowls, pheasants, snakes, porcupines, masked palm civets, gibbons, monkeys, mouse deer, and wolves.|$|R

50|$|Tiger Temple, or Wat Pha Luang Ta Bua Yanasampanno, was a Theravada Buddhist {{temple in}} the Sai Yok District of Thailand's Kanchanaburi Province {{in the west}} of the country. It was founded in 1994 as a forest temple and {{sanctuary}} for wild animals, among them <b>tigers,</b> mostly <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tigers.</b> The Tiger Temple charges an admission fee.|$|R
50|$|The {{geographic}} {{division between}} Malayan and <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tigers</b> is unclear as tiger populations in northern Malaysia are contiguous {{with those in}} southern Thailand. In Singapore tigers were extirpated in the 1950s, {{and the last one}} shot in 1932.|$|R
50|$|<b>Indochinese</b> <b>tigers</b> live in forests, grasslands, {{mountains}} and hills. They prefer mostly forested habitats such as tropical rainforests, evergreen forests, deciduous forests, tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests.Forests provide camouflage, and hunting grounds that fit their lifestyle and dietary needs.|$|R
50|$|There is {{no clear}} {{difference}} between the Malayan and the <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tiger</b> when specimens from the two regions are compared cranially or in pelage. No type specimen was designated.|$|E
50|$|Indochinese tigers mate {{throughout}} the year, but most frequently during November through early April. After a gestation period of 3.5 months, roughly 103 days, a female <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tiger</b> {{is capable of}} giving birth to seven cubs. However, on average a female will only give birth to three. <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tiger</b> cubs are born with their eyes and ears closed until they begin to open and function {{just a few days}} after birth. During the first year of life there is a 35% mortality rate, and 73% of those occurrences of infant mortality are the entire litter. Infant mortality in Indochinese tigers is often the result of fire, flood, and infanticide. As early as 18 months for some but as late as 28 months for others, <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tiger</b> cubs will break away from their mothers and begin hunting and living on their own. Females of the subspecies reach sexual maturity at 3.5 years of age while it takes males up to 5 years to reach sexual maturity.|$|E

40|$|I gered {{throughout}} Asia andr {{the likelihood}} of locating a ri-atrle wild tiger population in China is rapidly diminishing (Tilson 2004). Yunnan province on the borders to Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar may hold the last promise {{for the survival of}} <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tigers</b> Panthera tigris corbetti in southwest China (Seiden-sticker et al. 1999, Luo et al. 2004). However, a systematic assessment of tigers has not been conducted nor has direct evidence oftiger presence been documented except for seyeral anec-dotal reports in the past decade (Su & Zhang 2005, Li & Yang 2002 oHu et al. l 999,Meng et a|. 1995, He 1994). He (1994) compiled the informa-tion from the provincial forestry depart-ments.

50|$|The <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tiger</b> is {{a solitary}} animal. Due to its elusive {{behavior}} {{it is difficult}} to be observed and studied in the wild, so there is little knowledge about their behaviour.|$|E
5000|$|The last <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tiger</b> in {{the wild}} in China is {{believed}} to have been killed near Mengla in 2009. The perpetrator {{is believed to have}} been sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for this.|$|E

5000|$|National Geographic Society News Watch {{contributor}} Jordan Schaul wrote: Prior to {{the designation}} of the Malay subspecies there were approximately 60 <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tigers</b> in Asian, European and North American zoos. Today there are less than a handful. Zoos are committed to conserving the genetic integrity of the subspecies that do exist in the wild.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} eight tigers {{brought to}} the temple were rescues, and thus far DNA data is incomplete and therefore unavailable to the public, as the pedigree of the tigers is not entirely known. However, it is presumed that they are <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tigers,</b> except Mek, a Bengal tiger. It {{is possible that some}} may be the newly discovered Malayan tigers, as well as cross breeds or hybrids.|$|R
50|$|Their {{lifespan}} {{can range}} from 15 to 26 years of age depending on factors like living conditions and whether they are wild or in captivity. Due to their dwindling numbers, <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tigers</b> are known to inbreed, mating with available immediate family members. Inbreeding within this subspecies has led to weakened genes, lowered sperm count, infertility {{and in some cases}} defects such as cleft palates, squints, crossed-eyes, and swayback.|$|R
50|$|Species of mammals, some {{discovered}} relatively recently, {{include the}} following (Robichaud 2005): saola, giant muntjac, Roosevelt's muntjac, Truong Son muntjac, Indochinese warty pig, Heude's pig, Annamite striped rabbit, Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus), <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tiger,</b> and Asian elephant.|$|E
50|$|Of all tiger subspecies, the <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tiger</b> is {{the least}} {{represented}} in captivity and {{not part of a}} coordinated breeding program. As of 2007, 14 individuals were recognized as Indochinese tigers based on genetic analysis of 105 captive tigers in 14 countries.|$|E
50|$|Results of a phylogeographic {{study using}} 134 samples from tigers across the global range {{suggest that the}} {{historical}} northeastern distribution limit of the Bengal tiger is {{the region in the}} Chittagong Hills and Brahmaputra River basin, bordering the historical range of the <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tiger.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tiger's</b> skull {{is smaller}} than of the Bengal tiger; the ground {{coloration}} is darker with more rather short and narrow single stripes. In body size, it {{is smaller than}} Bengal and Siberian tigers. Males {{range in size from}} 2.55 to 2.85 m and in weight from 150 to 195 kg. Females range in size from 2.3 to 2.55 m and in weight from 100 to 130 kg.|$|R
50|$|The {{reserves}} elevations {{range from}} 100 to 2000 m above msl. The terrain is rugged with mountainous ranges {{in the north}} and narrow plains and sloping hill valleys in the south. The sanctuary slopes southwards towards the river valley of the Brahmaputra River. The area of Brahmaputra and Chittagong Hills, which includes Pakke and Namdapha Tiger Reserve, is the north-western limit of the <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tiger's</b> range, bordering the eastern limit of the Bengal tiger's range.|$|R
50|$|The park fauna {{included}} the Javan rhinoceros, {{and was one}} of only two populations in the world, until poachers shot and killed the last rhino in Cát Loc in 2010. There are also records of banteng and kouprey, but these may now be globally extinct, and wild Asian water buffalo no longer occur in Cat Tien. Some accounts also list <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tigers,</b> leopards, clouded leopards and dholes; however, a recent series of surveys did not confirm this.|$|R
5000|$|The {{endangered}} {{animal species}} sheltered {{by some of the}} fragmented, although relatively undisturbed Phi Pan Nam forests are the fishing cat, sun bear, Asiatic black bear, Chinese pangolin, <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tiger,</b> sambar deer, gaur, Bengal slow loris, Sunda pangolin, as well as the Asiatic softshell turtle and the big-headed turtle.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tiger</b> was {{proposed}} {{as a distinct}} subspecies in 1968 based on skin coloration, marking pattern and skull dimensions. It was named P. t. corbetti in honor of Jim Corbett. Until 2017, it was widely recognised as a subspecies, and is now subsumed to P. t. tigris.|$|E

50|$|Because of the {{elevation}} range from 300 to 4500 m and vegetation zones from evergreen, moist deciduous to temperate broadleaved and coniferous forest types to alpine vegetation, {{the park is}} home to a great diversity of mammal species. Four big cat species occur in the park: snow leopard, clouded leopard, Indian leopard and Bengal tiger.Namdapha and Pakke Tiger Reserve are in a region, which is the eastern limit of the Bengal tiger's and thenorth-western limit of the <b>Indochinese</b> <b>tiger's</b> range.|$|R
