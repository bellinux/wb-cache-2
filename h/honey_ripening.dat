40|$|ABSTRACT: Physical {{factors of}} {{refractive}} index, optical density, viscosity and surface tension demonstrated quantitative change throughout five stages of <b>honey</b> <b>ripening</b> process in indigenous hive honeybee Apis cerana indica. The five stages of nectar to honey transformations include floral nectar (fn), honey crop of foragers (hf), honey crop of house bees (hh), unsealed honey cells (uh) and sealed honey cells (sh). All the four physical factors gradually augmented through successive stages of <b>honey</b> <b>ripening</b> phenomena. The refractive index of floral nectaries and sealed honey cells was 1. 23 and 1. 49 respectively. Similarly, the optical density of house bees and unsealed honey cells was 0. 39 and 0. 54 respectively. Viscosity and surface tension of honey crop of foragers and sealed honey cells were 0. 15 poise, 0. 76 dynes/cms. and 76. 65 poise, 102. 01 dynes/cms. respectively. The {{analysis of variance}} (ANOVA) of viscosity and surface tension in honey formation was significant at P< 0. 01 % levels and refractive index and optical density of honey in ripening process was not significant at P< 0. 01 % levels Key words: Apis cerana indica, <b>honey</b> <b>ripening,</b> physical factors...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Chemical {{characteristics}} of TRS, NRS, ash, acidity and pH were detected in five stages of <b>honey</b> <b>ripening</b> process of indigenous hive honeybee Apis cerana indica. Five stages of nectar to honey transformation comprise floral nectar (fn), honey crop of foragers (hf), honey crop of house bees (hh), unsealed honey cells (uh) and sealed honey cells (sh). The TRS of fn and sh cells was 2. 12 % and 73. 01 % respectively. Correspondingly NRS of hh and uh cells was 14. 90 % and 7. 50 %. The ash content of hf and sh cells was 0. 20 % and 1. 49 % respectively, whereas the acidity of sh cells and hf was 0. 503 and 0. 06 respectively. Similarly pH of hh and uh cells had {{a value of}} 1. 03 and 2. 61. All the five parameters viz., TRS, NRS, ash, acidity and pH tested apart from NRS were less in floral nectaries and maximum in sealed honey cells. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of TRS of ripening of honey was significant at P< 0. 01 % levels, while NRS, ash, acidity and pH in honey formation was not significant at P< 0. 01 % levels.

40|$|The {{bacterial}} and fungal {{communities of}} vitex honey were surveyed by sequencing the 16 S rRNA gene {{and the internal}} transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA. Vitex honey samples were analyzed at different stage of ripening; the vitex flower was also analyzed, {{and the effect of}} the chemical composition in the experimental setup was assessed. The results confirmed the presence of dominant Bacillus spp. as the dominant bacterial in honey, and yeast related genera was the main fungal in the honey, respectively. Lactococcus and Enterococcus were detected {{for the first time in}} honey. The proportion of most of the fungal community decreased during the <b>honey</b> <b>ripening</b> process. Multivariate analyses also showed that the fungal community of 5, 10, and 15 days honey samples tended to cluster together and were completely separated from the 1 day honey sample. The change in the fungal community showed a correlation with the variation in the chemical components, such as moisture and phenolic compounds. Together, these results suggest that ripening of honey could change its microbial composition, and decrease the potential risk of microbiology...|$|E

50|$|The honey of the Trigona fuscipennis {{species is}} sour and watery. To protect their honey from {{bacterial}} contamination, Trigona fuscipennis bees use the enzyme glucose oxidase, stored in their hypopharyngeal glands.

40|$|Two main {{groups of}} bacteria, {{classified}} as Gluconobacter and Lactobacillus, {{are present in}} <b>ripening</b> <b>honey.</b> A third bacterial group, classified as Zymomonas, and several types of yeast are occasionally isolated. Both in natural honey and in synthetic syrup the bacterial population decreases {{in the course of}} the ripening process. Lactobacillus and Gluconobacter disappear after minimum moisture (about 18 %) is reached, but the former does so sooner than the latter. The presence of these bacteria in different parts of the bee has been also investigated...|$|R
50|$|Like the European {{honey bee}} (Apis mellifera), which {{provides}} most of Australia's commercially produced honey, stingless bees have enlarged areas {{on their back}} legs for carrying pollen back to the hive. After a foraging expedition, these pollen baskets or corbiculae can be seen stuffed full of bright orange or yellow pollen. Stingless bees also collect nectar, which they store in an extension of their gut called a crop. Back at the hive, the bees ripen or dehydrate the nectar droplets by spinning them inside their mouthparts until <b>honey</b> is formed. <b>Ripening</b> concentrates the nectar and increases the sugar content, {{though it is not}} nearly as concentrated as the honey from true honey bees; it is much thinner in consistency, and more prone to spoiling.|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{fast and}} {{straightforward}} procedure aimed at separating copper (Cu) ions from monosacharides and preconcentrating their traces before flame atomic absorp-tion spectrometry (FAAS) measurements was developed, and its suitability was {{evaluated by the}} analysis of freshly <b>ripened</b> <b>honeys</b> {{on the content of}} this environmentally and physiologically relevant element. This procedure included the passage (at 20 mL/min) of 10 % (m/v) solutions of honeys (100 mL) through resin beds of Dowex 50 W 9 8 - 400 to retain Cu by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and sep-arate it from the glucose and fructose matrix. In turn, SPE columns were rinsed at 20 mL/min with 20 mL of water and subsequently washed with 20 mL of a 0. 5 mol/L HNO 3 solution (at 2. 0 mL/min) to elute potassium and sodium. Preconcentrated Cu was stripped (at 2. 0 mL/min...|$|R
40|$|The GC and GC/MS {{analyses}} of the solvent organic extractive from the stomach of the bees, having collected Mentha spp. nectar, revealed the presence of methyl syringate (6. 6 %), terpendiol I (5. 0 %) and vomifoliol (3. 0 %) that {{can be attributed to}} the plant origin. Other major compounds from the bee-stomach were related to the composition of cuticular waxes and less to pheromones. Organic extractivesfrom Mentha spp. honey were obtained by solvent-free headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and ultrasonic solvent extraction (USE) and analyzed by GC and GC/MS. The major honey headspace compounds were hotrienol (31. 1 %– 38. 5 %), 2 -methoxy- 4 -methylphenol (0. 5 – 6. 0 %), cis- and trans-linalool oxides (0. 9 – 2. 8 %), linalool (1. 0 – 3. 1 %) and neroloxide (0. 9 – 1. 9 %). Methyl syringate was the most abundant compound (38. 3 - 56. 2 %) in the honey solvent extractives followed by vomifoliol (7. 0 – 26. 6 %). Comparison of the honey organic extractives with the corresponding bee-stomach extractive indicated that methyl syringate and vomofoliol were transferred to the honey while terpendiol I was partially transformed to hotrienol in <b>ripened</b> <b>honey...</b>|$|R
40|$|Honey is {{a natural}} {{substance}} produced by honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) from the nectar of blossoms or from secretions of living parts of plants or excretions of plant sucking insects on the living parts of plants, which honeybees collect, transform and combine with specific substances of their own, store and leave in the <b>honey</b> comb to <b>ripen</b> and mature. Besides being of carbohydrate-rich food, honey {{has been used as}} a functional food for its potential health benefits. To explain how different kinds of carbohydrate-rich foods directly affect blood sugar, the researchers developed the concept of the “glycemic index” (GI) that ranks carbohydrates on a scale based on how quickly and how much they raise blood sugar levels after eating. The diet should include adequate and healthy balance of nutrients, and according to many health professionals the concept of GI provides a useful means of selecting the most appropriate carbohydrate containing foods for the maintenance of health and the treatment of several disease states. There have been some studies on determining the GI of honey. Further more, we need to determine the GI of various honey types with different botanical and geografical origin. Researches on the issue will serve to bring awareness in the public consciousness...|$|R
