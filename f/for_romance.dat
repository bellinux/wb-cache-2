5|$|Ezra Pound {{is really}} at heart a very boyish fellow and an incurable provincial. It {{is true that}} he was driven to Europe by a thirst <b>for</b> <b>romance</b> and color that he could {{scarcely}} have satisfied in America, but he took to Europe the simple faith and pure enthusiasm of his native Idaho.... His sophistication is still juvenile, his ironies are still clumsy and obvious, he ridicules Americans in Europe not very much simpler than himself...|$|E

He returns to fight for his partner but nearly catches Izzy in bed with Paul. He leaves an expensive watch behind which Karl finds.

Fletcher told Herbison (Inside Soap) that Karl is jealous of Paul and relishes the opportunity to show off his gift and boast about Izzy. He was keen for his character to discover Izzy's infidelity so Karl and Paul could have a confrontation. Izzy goes into business with Paul and Karl tries to warn her that Paul is untrustworthy. He is unsuspecting and does not believe Izzy would be attracted to Paul. The story provides insight to Izzy who needs stability from Karl and excitement which Paul provides her.|$|E

25|$|According to American {{soap opera}} writer and romance novelist Leah Laiman, soap operas are best known and most remembered <b>for</b> <b>romance.</b> The romances in daytime dramas are {{significantly}} characterized by bringing couples together, splitting them up, and starting the cycle over again {{to ensure that}} viewers remain invested in the pairings, if popular.

500|$|Despite {{the greater}} {{independence}} that Roberts allotted her heroine, Dee is trapped within a patriarchal {{culture in which}} her uncle and prospective husband arrange her future. [...] The arranged marriage and ensuing events, including the misunderstanding and her running away, were common plot elements <b>for</b> <b>romance</b> novels at that time. [...] Dee's reactions, however, veered from the formulaic. [...] Her retorts brought to mind the [...] "quippy one-upmanship of feminist literature". [...] When a man attempts to rape her, Dee responds {{with a series of}} sharp comments, calling him, among other things, [...] "a filthy pig of a man", before succumbing to the traditional feminine response of fainting in horror.|$|E
500|$|Refn's {{inspiration}} for Drive came partly from reading Grimms' Fairy Tales, and {{his goal was}} to make [...] "a fairy tale that takes Los Angeles as the background," [...] with The Driver as the hero. To play with the common theme of fairy tales, The Driver protects what is good {{while at the same time}} killing degenerate people in violent ways. Refn was also inspired by films such as Point Blank (1967), Two-Lane Blacktop (1971), The Driver (1978) and Thief (1981). Jean-Pierre Melville's crime productions influenced the cinematography. Amini's script propensity imposes [...] "a kind of sideways moral code," [...] where even those who comply with it are almost never rewarded for their efforts, as seen when The Driver helps Standard with Irene and her son's best interests in mind. In their vehicles, the characters not only make escapes or commit murder, but try to find peace and search <b>for</b> <b>romance.</b>|$|E

500|$|Shubhra Gupra of The Indian Express was {{particularly}} {{critical of the}} length of the film and wrote: [...] "Ashutosh Gowariker's latest, which stretches close to four hours running time, starts feeling like bargain-basement from the get go. It's much too long, and, despite Priyanka's valiant efforts, just not engaging enough." [...] Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama gave it a negative review, criticising the writing and the length and saying that [...] "What's Your Raashee? has some wonderful moments and award-worthy performance by Priyanka Chopra, but everything pales into insignificance when the written material is weak." [...] Anupama Chopra of NDTV was highly disappointed with the film, terming it a [...] "gargantuan misstep" [...] for Gowariker: [...] "This epic length simply doesn't work <b>for</b> <b>romance.</b> At nearly four hours, What's Your Raashee? is a marathon watch. And the rewards for enduring it are slim." [...] Sudhish Kamath was also disappointed with the film, criticising the time taken (over 25 minutes) in the first act to reach the first episode: [...] "Priyanka Chopra acquits each of these types with unique quirks associated with these signs and is quite charming in most of her avatars, but there is seriously, no other reason for you to watch this movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Jasmine {{demonstrates}} several traits, {{beliefs and}} ideologies associated with feminism, exercising much [...] "feminist potential", although notably less explicit than Belle's. Nonetheless, the character still adheres to traditional romance-oriented aspirations {{commonly associated with}} Disney's princess characters despite [...] "her modern, feminist attitude", although her yearning <b>for</b> <b>romance</b> is much more subdued in comparison. Steve Daly of Entertainment Weekly identified Jasmine as [...] "a sexually aware, proto-feminist princess". [...] "New" [...] Exoticisms: Changing Patterns in the Construction of Otherness author Isabel Santaolalla wrote that Jasmine appears to have inherited [...] "the legacy bequeathed by the 1960s Women's Movement." [...] Having [...] "stepped out of the 90s" [...] according to The Washington Posts Desson Howe, Jasmine is appropriately opposed to the glass ceiling." [...] Defying marriage laws and arranged marriages are also among Jasmine's central themes. Larkin believes that her character is responsible for inspiring a change in her kingdom's marriage laws, explaining, [...] "Jasmine didn't just believe in something, she fought against something that she saw was an injustice... She actively sought change and made it happen." [...] Musker agreed that the princess [...] "rebel against the social structure in choosing to marry someone of her own free will". According to singer Brad Kane, who provides Aladdin's singing voice, [...] "Aladdin is a stealth feminist movie" [...] because Jasmine is [...] "willing to give up being a princess to not get stuck marrying someone." [...] Jasmine's defiance eventually successfully convinces her father to change the constitution.|$|E
