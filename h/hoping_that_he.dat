5|$|Miller was {{unfit to}} bowl during the Second Test at Lord's. During England's first innings, Bradman threw Miller the ball, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would reverse his {{decision}} not to bowl. Miller refused and returned the ball, citing his back. Miller's action generated news headlines, with journalists believing that he had disobeyed Bradman.|$|E
5|$|A 1788 {{letter in}} the Kentucky Gazette {{indicated}} that Marshall had unsuccessfully sought election to the Virginia General Assembly, although {{the year of the}} contest is not given. The letter continued that the defeat convinced Marshall that he could not win elected office in Fayette County and that he subsequently lobbied for the creation of Bourbon County, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might gain an office in that new county. When the county was created in 1785, he immediately applied to become the county lieutenant, but that office had apparently already been promised to someone else. Marshall applied for appointment as deputy lieutenant, and received the appointment.|$|E
5|$|A corrupt {{political}} leader named Chedi Singh (Sonu Sood) meets Chulbul and both quickly become enemies. Makkhi asks {{his father to}} arrange his marriage with Nirmala. His father refuses because he needs money to repay the loans he took to make his factory, and he believes that he can acquire money through his son marrying a rich girl. In desperate need of money, Makkhi steals from Chulbul's cupboard and gives the stolen cash to Nirmala's father, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will permit Makkhi to marry Nirmala. Meanwhile, Chulbul meets Rajjo and proposes marriage, which she rejects, as she has {{to take care of}} her father, Haria (Mahesh Manjrekar)—a drunkard.|$|E

60|$|I {{could not}} drive {{from my mind}} the vision of that man even when I knew he was asleep in his bed. There was no way of {{throwing}} him off. His wife had expressed to my grandmother the delight she felt in having him {{in the room with}} her while she worked, and my grandmother had spoken to me of her own sympathetic pleasure in this arrangement. I saw {{it would be impossible to}} exile him again to the apple-tree, even if the ground should ever be dry enough. There was no <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be left at his home; there was no <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would get better, and go off to attend to his own business; there was no <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would die.|$|R
5|$|England made 141 and Bradman {{forced them}} to follow on. Miller removed Hutton again, this time caught by Sid Barnes from the first ball of the innings. He {{combined}} with Barnes 45 minutes later to remove Hutton's opening partner Washbrook to leave England at 3/33. The pitch, still rain-affected, hastened England's defeat by an innings and 332 runs within 44 overs. Miller finished with 2/17 from 11 overs in the second innings to end with match figures of 9/77. England had fallen to their heaviest Test defeat on Australian soil, losing 15 wickets {{in the space of}} 210 minutes on the fifth day. Miller's highly productive Ashes debut led to further speculation as to whether he was willing to end his Test career to turn professional in England. Miller continued to ignore Rawtenstall's requests for confirmation and refused to comment on the issue to the media, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would get a better job offer in Australia in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|In flashbacks, Ann is {{hired by}} a wealthy and {{sophisticated}} aristocrat (Umbers) {{to act as}} a governess for his orphaned nephew and niece who live at Bly. He tells her that he is not to be bothered in London, and that Ann is to deal with any problems that may arise. Ann travels to Bly, where she meets the all-female household staff—led by Mrs Sarah Grose (Johnston), the housekeeper—and then the young Flora (Sayer), one of Ann's new pupils. Ann finds the house somewhat unnerving, and the staff standoffish and unwilling to talk. Ann subsequently receives a letter informing her that Miles (Lindsay), her other pupil, has been expelled from his boarding school, but is assured by Mrs Grose that Miles is well behaved. When he arrives at Bly, Ann finds Miles to be charming, and although he does not explain what happened at school, she does not push him. Her interactions with the children are idyllic, and they sail on Bly's lake and enjoy picnics together. Meanwhile, Ann fantasises about the Master, futilely <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will visit.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphia Athletics {{indicated}} {{immediate interest}} in Chamberlain, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would pitch {{most of the}} team's games. Chamberlain earned a 22–23 win-loss record in 1891. He was the losing pitcher {{in the last of}} 485 shutouts recorded in the few seasons of American Association play. In August, he gave up the longest home run that had been hit at Boston's Congress Street Grounds. Chamberlain pitched for the NL's Cincinnati Reds in 1892, compiling a 19–23 record. In May of that season, Chamberlain pitched in an unusual game that was suspended due to sunlight; the scoreless game was in extra innings when umpire Jack Sheridan ruled that the sun was too bright for players to see the ball. The 1892 Reds finished with an overall record of 82–68. League officials split the season into two halves and the Reds finished fourth and eighth in the respective halves.|$|E

5|$|Jason X (2001) {{takes place}} in the future, when Jason has again been inexplicably resurrected. A scientist, Rowan Lafontaine (Lexa Doig), decides that cryonic {{suspension}} is the only method of stopping him, but Jason breaks free and kills the army personnel guarding him before he can be again imprisoned. Rowan manages to lure Jason into the cryo‑chamber, but he ruptures the tank and freezes both himself and Rowan. Over 400 years later, a team of students studying Earth discover Jason's body and take it into space. Upon being thawed by the team, he proceeds to murder everyone aboard the spacecraft. He is seemingly killed, but is then resurrected via nanotechnology as a cyborg version of himself. Finally, he is ejected into space and incinerated by Earth Two's atmosphere, his mask falling to the bottom of a lake. The next Friday the 13th film, Freddy vs. Jason (2003), was a crossover with A Nightmare on Elm Street. Set in the contemporary period, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) resurrects Jason (Ken Kirzinger) and sends him to Springwood <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will create enough fear among the residents that Freddy will be strong enough to invade their dreams. Jason accomplishes this but refuses to stop killing. A battle ensues both in the dream-world and at Crystal Lake. The outcome is left ambiguous, as Jason surfaces from the lake holding Freddy's severed head, which winks and laughs.|$|E

25|$|After the Red Wings {{announced}} {{that they would not}} be re-signing Chelios, he signed a 25-game pro tryout contract with the Chicago Wolves. After a second 25-game pro tryout contract with the Wolves, Chelios signed a two-way contract with the Atlanta Thrashers. Chelios remained with the Wolves until he was recalled to the Thrashers, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could provide a spark for the team's playoff hopes. He played in seven games for the Thrashers, but failed to score any points. On April 7, 2010, Chelios was sent back to the Wolves.|$|E
25|$|As {{he grew up}} he professed {{a desire}} to move to Argentina and breed horses, having heard anecdotes of life in South America from {{people who lived in}} his village. His mother, however, {{continued}} to push him towards a career in the army, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would follow in his father's footsteps and join the Royal Sussex Regiment. In the end she managed to convince him that a military career was the best option for him given the limited financial resources available to him with which to pursue his business interests.|$|E
25|$|Isaac, having {{escaped the}} ogres, {{searches}} for Henry, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is dead.

Snow holds the heart that belongs to Prince Charming and uses it to command him with orders to behead Isaac, but Isaac schemes his way out of it by convincing them that he knows some of their secrets, since he wrote them in the first place. Isaac tells Snow that she can get her happy ending again (which was love with Prince James in this timeline), if she agrees to kill Henry along with Regina.|$|E

25|$|Moore, before retreating, {{received}} {{intelligence of}} Soult's 16,000 man corps' scattered and isolated position at Carrión {{and that the}} French were unaware of the British army's position. On 15 December he seized at this opportunity to advance on the French near Madrid <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might defeat Soult and possibly divert Napoleon’s forces. A junction with Baird on 20 December, advancing from Corunna, raised Moore's strength to 23,500 infantry, 2,400 cavalry and 60 guns and he opened his attack with a successful raid by Lieutenant-General Paget's cavalry on the French picquets at Sahagún on 21 December. However, Moore failed to follow up against a surprised Soult, halting for two days and allowing Soult to concentrate his corps.|$|E
25|$|Alexander quietly {{moved his}} part of the army {{upstream}} and then traversed the river in utmost secrecy, using ‘skin floats filled with hay’ as well as ‘smaller vessels cut in half, the thirty oared galleys into three’. Furthermore, Craterus engaged in frequent feints that he may cross the river. As a result, Porus, 'no longer expecting a sudden attempt under cover of darkness, was lulled into a sense of security.' Alexander mistakenly landed on an island, but soon crossed to the other side. Porus perceived his opponent's maneuver and sent a small cavalry and chariot force under his son, also named Porus, to fight them off, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be able to prevent his crossing. By chance a storm occurred that night which drowned the sounds of the crossing.|$|E
25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Kurdish forces, the British exiled Mahmud Barzanji to India. In July 1920, 62 tribal leaders of the region called for the independence of Kurdistan under a British mandate. The objection of the British to Kurdish self-rule sprang from the fear that success of an independent Kurdish area would tempt the two Arab areas of Baghdad and Basra to follow suit, hence endangering the direct British control over all Mesopotamia. In 1922, Britain restored Shaikh Mahmud to power, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would organize the Kurds to act as a buffer against the Turks, who had territorial claims over Mosul and Kirkuk. However, defiant to the British, in 1922 Shaikh Mahmoud declared a Kurdish Kingdom with himself as king. It took two years for the British to bring Kurdish areas into submission, while Shaikh Mahmud found refuge in an unknown location.|$|E

Another witness identified as Turner testified that he had heard a member of parliament mention that the government had offered Doyle $16,000 and passage to anywhere in the world to restart his life, if he would make a sworn statement against Whelan. However Susan Wheatley later testified that she had heard Turner say he would swear his grandfather's life away for $10,000 or $20,000 and no mention was made of Doyle. Later witnesses were actually directly asked to swear whether they had received any money for their testimony.|$|E

25|$|After West Indies tour, Malinga {{suffered}} by back injury and a knee injury. With this, {{he did not}} participate to both New Zealand tour and India tour, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will recover when 2016 ICC World Twenty20 begins. However, Malinga was appointed as the captain for 2016 Asia Cup, where he was only able to play against UAE, with a match-winning bowling performance. The knee injury backed up him in the next matches and Sri Lanka lost all matches due to absence of Malinga in the team. Sri Lanka announced his World T20 team with Malinga as the captain, but continuous injuries results Malinga to stepped down from captaincy and Angelo Mathews has been named as the captain in all formats. Even though Sri Lanka felt that Malinga will recover for the World cup matches, his injury results him to ruled out of the Twenty20 squad.
