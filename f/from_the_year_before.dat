5|$|The team's biggest {{successes in}} 2008 were the overall {{victories}} by Contador in the Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta a España. As {{the team was}} barred from competing in the Tour de France that year, {{as well as other}} events organized by the Amaury Sport Organisation, Contador was unable to defend his championship <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Dr. Joe McInnis and Woodman {{organised}} {{an attempt}} to identify the priority targets <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>before.</b> A chartered aircraft landed on the ice at three of the locations, a hole was drilled through the ice, and a small sector-scan sonar was used to image the sea bottom. Unfortunately, due to ice conditions and uncertain navigation, {{it was not possible}} to exactly confirm the locations of the holes, and nothing was found although hitherto-unknown depths were found at the locations that were consistent with Inuit testimony of the wreck.|$|E
5|$|Of Stanford's other orchestral works, his six Irish Rhapsodies all {{date from}} the 20th century, the first from 1901 and the last <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> his death. Two of the set feature solo {{instruments}} along with the orchestra: the third (cello) and the sixth (violin). In Dibble's view some of the concertante works such as the First Piano Concerto (1894) and the Violin Concerto (1899) are in their orchestration and their lyricism {{as much in the}} tradition of Mendelssohn as of Brahms, with whom Stanford's music is often compared.|$|E

5|$|After {{spending}} the offseason hunting with Smoky Joe Wood, Coveleski {{returned to the}} Indians in 1921, and throughout the season, the Indians battled the Yankees for first in the American League. On September 26, the two teams faced off, but Coveleski failed to make it past the third inning; the Yankees won 8–7 to ensure they won the pennant. Coveleski pitched 315 innings in 1921, matching his career high <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>before,</b> and had a 23–13 record and a 3.37 ERA. The following season, Coveleski married Frances Stivetts, the sister of his late wife. While he did cause the Yankees {{to move out of}} first place after winning an August 23 game against them, 4–1, it was his last game of the season. He finished the year with a 17–14 record, the first time since 1917 he did not have 20 wins, and a 3.32 ERA.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} four episodes of Supernatural aired in 2005, the WB decided {{to pick up the}} series for a full season of 22episodes. During those first episodes, the series was ranked third in males aged 18–34 and 12–34. It also posted an {{increase}} of 73% in males aged 18–49 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>before,</b> although it only gained 4% in total viewers, and retained 91% of viewers from its lead-in, Gilmore Girls. Supernaturals first season averaged about 3.81million American viewers. According to Special Forces Soldier Master Sergeant Kevin Wise at a 2007 Supernatural convention, the DVDs most requested by armed forces personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan were the first two seasons of the series.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{work began}} in August 1898, {{although}} the BS was continuing {{to develop new}} route plans. The bill for 1899, published on 22 November 1898, requested more time for the construction works and proposed two extensions to the railway and a modification to part of the previously approved route. The first extension, like the NC's plan <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>before,</b> was to branch from the already-approved route under Park Crescent, but then followed a more northerly route than the NC, running under Regent's Park to cross the park's Outer Circle between Chester Road and Cumberland Gate where a station was to be constructed. The route then followed Cumberland Street West (now Nash Street), Cumberland Market, Cumberland Street East and Edward Street (both now Varndell Street), before ending at a station under Cardington Street {{on the west side}} of Euston station.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his growing}} {{national}} fame, Dow continued to face opposition at home. Both Dow and his opponents engaged in anonymous newspaper campaigns against the other, often making personal attacks alongside political arguments. For the 1852 municipal election, the Democrats nominated Albion Parris, {{a former governor}} and United States Senator, to run against Dow. While the Democrats rallied behind their candidate, Dow's vigorous enforcement of prohibition divided his party, and in two wards the Whigs ran an anti-Dow ticket instead. On election day, Dow slightly increased his vote total <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>before,</b> with 1496, but Parris outpolled him, bringing in 1900 votes. Although the Whigs controlled voter registration at the time, Dow blamed his loss on illegal voting by Irish immigrants.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} part, Nico Rosberg was fastest, {{half a second}} faster than {{teammate}} Hamilton, and 1.7 seconds clear of the pole position lap time <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>before.</b> Both McLarens had shown promising pace, but nevertheless dropped out of contention in 12th and 14th, while Daniil Kvyat was the last driver to secure a place in Q3, demoting Carlos Sainz Jr. to 11th. Kvyat's Red Bull teammate Daniel Ricciardo also progressed, albeit suffering a failure of his wing mirror, which hung {{off the side of}} his vehicle during his last timed lap. Eliminated at the back were both Haas drivers, along Nico Hülkenberg, who was unable to follow his teammate Pérez into Q3 and qualified 13th.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2008–09 season, Paul signed a {{contract}} extension with the Hornets worth $68 million. On December 17, 2008, he set the NBA record for consecutive games with a steal at 106. On several occasions, he came within a few steals of recording a quadruple-double, including a 27-point, 10 rebound, 15 assist, and 7 steal game against the Philadelphia 76ers on January 26, 2009. His final averages were 22.8 points, 5.5 rebounds, 11 assists, and 2.8 steals per game. Despite Paul's individual accomplishments, New Orleans' record fell <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> and they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Denver Nuggets.|$|E

5|$|During the 2000 Copa Libertadores, Boca Juniors {{returned}} {{to the top of}} the continent and raised the Copa Libertadores again after 22 years. Led by Carlos Bianchi, the Virrey, along with outstanding players like Mauricio Serna, Jorge Bermúdez, Óscar Córdoba, Juan Roman Riquelme, and Martín Palermo, among others, revitalized the club to establish it among the world's best. The Xeneizes started this legacy by defeating defending champion Palmeiras in the final series. Boca Juniors won the 2001 edition after, once again, defeating Palmeiras in the semifinals and Cruz Azul in the final series to successfully defend the trophy. Cruz Azul became the first ever Mexican club to reach the final after great performances against River Plate and an inspired Rosario Central. Like their predecessors from the late 1970s however, Boca Juniors would fall short of winning three consecutive titles. As with Juan Carlos Lorenzo's men, the Xeneizes became frustrated as they were eliminated by Olimpia, this time during the quarterfinals. Led by World Cup winner-turned manager Nery Pumpido, Olimpia would overcome Grêmio (after some controversy) and surprise finalists São Caetano. Despite this triumph, Olimpia did not create the winning mystique of its past golden generations and bowed out in the round of 16 the following season, after being routed by Grêmio 6–2, avenging their controversial loss <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
5|$|The route {{was then}} to {{continue}} east under Fleet Street to Ludgate Circus for an interchange with the South Eastern and Chatham Railway's (SECR's) Ludgate Hill station, then south under New Bridge Street, and east into Queen Victoria Street where a station was planned {{to connect to}} the District Railway's Mansion House station. The route was then to continue under Queen Victoria Street to reach the CLR's station at Bank, where separate platforms below the existing ones were to be provided. The final section of the route developed on the proposed loop <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> with tunnels winding under the City's narrow, twisting streets. The tunnels were to run east, one below the other, beneath Cornhill and Leadenhall Street, north under St Mary Axe and west to Liverpool Street station, then south under Blomfield Street, east under Great Winchester Street, south under Austin Friars and Old Broad Street and west under Threadneedle Street where the tunnels were {{to connect with the}} existing sidings back into Bank. Two stations were to be provided on the loop; {{at the south end of}} St Mary Axe and at Liverpool Street station. To accommodate the additional rolling stock needed to operate the longer line, the depot was to be extended northwards. The power station was also to be enlarged to increase the electricity supply. The CLR estimated that its plan would cost £3,781,000 (approximately £ today): £2,110,000 for construction, £873,000 for land and £798,000 for electrical equipment and trains.|$|E
