25|$|<b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> hard to {{say this}} truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part {{of the responsibility for}} this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

When I think of them: Vienna-Ottakring, Munich-Giesing, Berlin-Pankow ! If I compare the two types, that of these degenerate Italians and our type, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult to say {{which of the two}} is the more antipathetic." ...|$|E
500|$|Potter {{produced}} two books per annum for Warne, but by 1910 she was juggling {{the demands of}} aging parents {{with the business of}} operating Hill Top, and her literary and artistic productivity began to decline. The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse was the only book Potter published in 1910. She wrote a friend on New Year's Day 1911: [...] "I did not succeed in finishing more than one book last year ... <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult lately to get the drawings done. I {{do not seem to be}} able to go into the country for a long enough time to do a sufficient amount of sketching and when I was at Bowness last summer I spent most of my time upon the road going backwards & forwards to the farm [...] which was amusing, but not satisfactory for work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a {{delightful}} custom," [...] he admitted. [...] "It keeps one {{always on the}} qui vive; one never knows whom one may see. Incidentally, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> interferes <b>very</b> much with my digestion." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> also <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> {{distressing}} {{that because}} the parents’ attitudes and interactions are important determinants of schizophrenic disorders, some therapists and family caseworkers treat parents as villains who have ruined {{the lives of their}} patients.|$|R
5000|$|... "Antwerp did not organise the {{deportation}} of the Jews, it was {{the victim}} of Nazi occupation ... Those who were in power at the time had to take tricky decisions in difficult times. <b>I</b> don't <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> courageous to stigmatise them now." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Warne's death and the purchase of Hill Top, Potter produced tales and illustrations inspired by her farm, its woodland surroundings, and nearby villages. She provided Warnes with two books per annum, but, by 1910, she was juggling the demands of ageing parents {{with the business of}} operating Hill Top, and, as a result, her literary and artistic productivity began to decline. She published only one book in 1910, The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse, and wrote to a friend on New Year's Day 1911:I did not succeed in finishing more than one book last year ... <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult lately to get the drawings done. I {{do not seem to be}} able to go into the country for a long enough time to do a sufficient amount of sketching and when I was at Bowness last summer I spent most of my time upon the road going backwards & forwards to the farm [...] which was amusing, but not satisfactory for work.|$|E
500|$|The most {{interesting}} {{part of that}} {{for me is that}} audiences seem very unwilling to believe the stuff that Teddy [...] says at the end and yet why? I think its because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make it very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E
500|$|I'm {{influenced}} by everything. By books, by the weather, by the water, by my shoes, if they're comfortable or not. Everything. One {{of it is}} music, but I {{think it is very}} important with people who are dealing with making music that they are not only {{influenced by}} music. And <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> sad when you find a record, and it says on : [...] "this record was inspired by Miles Davis." [...] Because it's like making...a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life. So I'm influenced by real life. And when people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, I can see great influence from this artist in there", I read that and I say [...] "Okay, I didn't succeed". But if people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, this made me feel like this and that [...] ", that's right. It should be beyond style, beyond influence, it should be about pure emotion, and real life.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Why, Eva, if I {{thought it}} had been done by design, <b>I</b> should <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> hard to forgive you for it at all, rather hard even to accept Guy, so you had better not try to disturb my belief {{that it was only}} that spirit of {{mischief}} that makes you now and then a little mad.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Miss Bowater! She {{is indeed}} clever; a--a {{brilliant}} young lady. The very {{life of a}} party, I assure you. And, yet, do you know, in parochial gatherings, try as I may, <b>I</b> occasionally <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult {{to get people to}} mix. The little social formulas, the prejudices. Yet, surely, Miss M., religion should be the great solvent. At least, that is my view." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "So <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> {{hard that}} they don't {{know where they}} left her, do they have no records or do people forget things {{as soon as they}} do them?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Hopkins said {{said she}} is [...] "pushing back the walls closing in on freedom of speech" [...] at a Church and Media conference in October 2015. Claiming to be [...] "the new Jesus" [...] during her speech, she said: [...] "I have never apologised for {{anything}} I’ve said. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> disappointing when people apologise. You should have the positive moral attitude to stand by what you say".|$|E
2500|$|Marilyn Manson {{released}} a live video album on November 2, 1999 titled God Is in the T.V., which contained unreleased footage including a behind-the-scenes backstage {{look at some}} of the experiences the band underwent during the Beautiful Monsters Tour. He claimed it clarified the real motive for Hole's departure. He added, [...] "There's a really great speech [...] gives about me and her insecurity and lack of fans at the concerts. Although it disparages her somewhat, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> amusing." [...] He also {{released a}} live album on November 12, 1999 titled The Last Tour on Earth that documented curated performances by his band from various concerts during the tour.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose the}} crammer {{will be in}} London," [...] he said. [...] "Everything there will be new to me and, no doubt, <b>I</b> shall <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> interesting. They {{say that it is}} an immense place, to which even the biggest Indian city is but a mere trifle. It will be curious to see {{everyone}} in dark clothes, with none of the gay colouring of India.|$|R

He is also a long distance cyclist and is very proud of his [...] "Giant FCR 1 Flatbar Road Bike". He says, [...] "I get most of my praying done while riding. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> a <b>very</b> contemplative exercise which easily gives itself to prayer and meditation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "London {{has never}} seemed {{like that to}} me. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> {{generally}} a <b>very</b> ugly and a very sordid place, where I am hedged in with relatives, generally wanting {{me to do the}} thing I loathe.--You have really no news for me, then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How am I {{to keep an}} {{indifferent}} {{face this}} evening before those two women?" [...] he groaned. [...] "General! <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult to forgive you." ...|$|E

5000|$|Cetaganda was {{nominated}} for the Locus Award in 1997, {{the same year as}} Memory, the following book in the series. It received mixed reviews, with The SF Site stating that it has [...] "a good and delicious mystery at its core", while a Tor.com review stated [...] "I don’t find the Cetagandan political set-up very plausible, and worse, <b>I</b> don’t <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> interesting." [...] SFF.net stated that [...] "All in all, this is certainly an enjoyable book, though not (Bujold's) best.|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, {{referring}} to the 1989 fairness legislation, Mousley {{said it was an}} [...] "impossible" [...] task for the Boundaries Commission to achieve the legislated requirement, stating [...] "It is a constitutional requirement, and until the constitution gets changed, I must say <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> a <b>very</b> inexact science".

2500|$|Sanger said {{he found}} no {{evidence}} for a God so he became an agnostic. In an interview published in the Times newspaper in 2000 Sanger is quoted as saying: [...] "My father was a committed Quaker and I was brought up as a Quaker, and for them truth is very important. I drifted away from those beliefs – one is obviously looking for truth, but one needs some evidence for it. Even if I wanted to believe in God <b>I</b> would <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult. <b>I</b> would need to see proof." ...|$|R

I fancy Mr. Warburton is afraid of him, and is a little given to fancy that everybody should bow down to him. Now if there is anything certain about the Duke it is this,--that he doesn't want any one to bow down to him. He hates all bowing down." ...|$|R
5000|$|Richard {{said that}} his faith in God was tested in 1999 after {{the murder of his}} close friend, the British {{television}} presenter Jill Dando. He said: [...] "I was really angry with God. It shook me rigid that someone as beautiful, talented and harmless could have been killed." [...] Richard said that Dando had many likeable qualities and described her as [...] "a very genuine person". He said of Dando's murder: [...] "It is very difficult to understand and <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> all <b>very</b> confusing." [...] He attended her funeral in May 1999 in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, for it {{is always}} {{necessary}} to beware of the open mind. <b>I</b> myself <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult to believe the same thing every day. And {{the fact is that}} whatever you believe will probably not alter the truth, which may be said to have a certain mysterious immutability, considering the number of efforts men have made to change it from time to time. We are now, however, just above the City Tabernacle, and if you will close your wings we shall penetrate it through the clap-trap-door which enables its preachers now and then to ascend to higher spheres." ...|$|R

60|$|Charming a {{creature}} as the wood wren appears when thus viewed closely {{in the early}} spring-time, he is not my favourite among small birds because of his beauty of shape and colour and graceful motions, which are seen only for a short time, but {{on account of his}} song, which lasts until September; though <b>I</b> may not <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> easy to give a reason for the preference.|$|R
