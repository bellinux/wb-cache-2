We investigated which factors determine comfort/discomfort <b>in</b> <b>using</b> hand tools according to users. Therefore, descriptors of comfort/discomfort <b>in</b> <b>using</b> hand tools {{were collected from}} literature and interviews. After that, the relatedness of a selection of the descriptors to comfort <b>in</b> <b>using</b> hand tools was investigated. Six comfort factors could be distinguished (functionality, posture and muscles, irritation and pain of hand and fingers, irritation of hand surface, handle characteristics, aesthetics). These six factors can be classified into three meaningful groups: functionality, physical interaction and appearance. The main conclusions were that (1) the same descriptors were related to comfort and discomfort <b>in</b> <b>using</b> hand tools, (2) descriptors of functionality are most related to comfort <b>in</b> <b>using</b> hand tools followed by descriptors of physical interaction and (3) descriptors of appearance become secondary <b>in</b> comfort <b>in</b> <b>using</b> hand tools. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
