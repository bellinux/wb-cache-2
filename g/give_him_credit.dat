500|$|A {{few days}} before the release, screenwriter Yash Patnaik claimed that Ra.One resembled a concept that he had {{developed}} several years before. Patnaik appealed to the Bombay High Court to delay the film's release, until he was given due credit or 10% of the film's overall profit. The court, observing prima facie evidence that there had been copyright violations, asked the filmmakers to deposit [...] with the court on 21 October 2011 before releasing the film. However, Patnaik challenged the court's decision and demanded that the producers <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> and not cash. Sinha later claimed that he alone had developed the film's story.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his success}} in {{advancing}} Nixon's career, Chotiner was respected, but was not universally popular among the Vice President's backers. Frank Jorgensen, one of Nixon's first backers in the Voorhis race, said of the attorney, [...] "I knew that Murray was very impatient with people who didn't have the IQ that he had. He had the habit of {{a man like that}} of tramping on them. He'd move ahead. He'd just leave the wreckage behind him, but he would get the job done." [...] Nixon family friend and Whittier College trustee Herman Perry stated, [...] "When Murray develops a little more of the techniques of public relations, I {{will be one of the}} first to recognize it and one of the first to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit...</b> The one thing I do not want him to do is be the quarterback and call the plays on the team on which I play." ...|$|E
500|$|City Lights {{marked the}} first time Chaplin {{composed}} the film score to one of his productions. While Chaplin preferred his films to have live sound by the 1930s most theaters had gotten rid of their orchestras. Many of his critics claimed he was doing it to grab more credit. Chaplin, whose parents and many members of the Chaplin family were both musicians, was struggling with the professional musicians he hired and took it upon himself to compose the score himself. It was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston and included over one hundred musical cues. Chaplin told a reporter that [...] "I really didn't write it down. I la-laed and Arthur Johnson wrote it down, and I wish you would <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> because he did a very good job. It is all simple music, you know, in keeping with my character." [...] The intention was to have a score that would translate the characters' emotions through its melodies. The score was recorded in five days with musical arranger Alfred Newman.|$|E

500|$|History {{views the}} results of the [...] "Tuskegee Airmen Experiment" [...] as a {{tremendous}} success, in which Parrish played a significant role, and proved that blacks could perform well in both leadership and combat roles. Parrish felt people should be judged by their capability, not their color. During its development Parrish would often return from Washington DC depressed because of the massive resistance to the Tuskegee program. Decades later at Tuskegee Airmen reunions, when Parrish's name was called everyone applauded with a standing ovation. The experience of the AAF during World War II necessitated that the military review its policies on the utilization of black servicemembers. Confrontation, discussion, and coordination with both black and white groups led AAF leaders to the conclusion that active commitment, leadership, and equal opportunity produced a more cost-effective, viable military force. In 1948, President Harry Truman signed an Executive Order on equality of treatment and opportunity in the military, due in no small part to the successes of the Tuskegee Airmen. Parrish was commander of Tuskegee Field from 1942 to 1946 and historians generally <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> for improving morale, living conditions, relations between blacks and whites, and relations with local citizens.|$|E
500|$|Thierry Henry {{paid tribute}} to Larsson's {{contribution}} to Barcelona's win after the game, saying, [...] "People always talk about Ronaldinho, Eto'o, Giuly and everything, but I didn't see them today, I saw Henrik Larsson. He came on, he changed the game, that is what killed the game. Sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto'o and people like that; {{you need to talk}} about the proper footballer who made the difference, and that was Henrik Larsson tonight." [...] Henry also remarked, [...] "You have to remember that Barcelona is a team. It's not Eto'o, it's not Ronaldinho. On Wednesday, the man who made the difference was Henrik Larsson. You have to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> for that because when he came on he made some amazing runs around the box and he showed he is a team player. You saw two times he fed the ball back to people and that's what I always talk about, he is a team player. He did that against us, even though the first goal was a close offside decision." [...] Larsson's addition giving Barcelona the cutting edge required to overcome Arsenal was noted by international press.|$|E

[...] Ben Williams of New York magazine commented that Timberlake is [...] "better at being sappy than sexy" [...] and concluded, [...] "If he hasn't yet invented a persona intriguing enough {{to live up to}} his music, <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> for being one of the few white men still brave enough to make black music." [...] Robert Christgau of Rolling Stone found Timberlake's [...] "best new" [...] songs [...] "thrilling", although [...] "some of the up-tempo stuff flirts with mechanical muscle-flexing" [...] and [...] "Losing My Way" [...] is a [...] "well-meaning" [...] but [...] "clueless embarrassment." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, he cited [...] "My Love" [...] and [...] "SexyBack" [...] as highlights and gave the album a three-star honorable mention, indicating [...] "an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure." ...|$|E

500|$|The Varkari Panth (Pilgrim Path) or Varkari Sampradaya (Pilgrim Tradition) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} Vaishnava sects in India. It is a monotheistic, bhakti sect, focused on the worship of Vithoba and based on traditional Bhagavata dharma. The sect is a [...] "Shaiva-Vaishnava synthesis" [...] and [...] "nominal Vaishnavism, containing a free mix of other religions". It is believed to have originated in Karnataka and migrated to Maharashtra. This last theory is based on a reference to Vithoba as [...] "Kannada" [...] (belonging to Karnataka) in the work of the first of the poet-saints, Dnyaneshwar. However, this word can also be interpreted as [...] "difficult to understand". Varkaris and scholars who believe Pundalik to have been a historical figure also consider him to be founder of the cult of Vithoba. This is evidenced by the liturgical call—Pundalikavarada Hari Vitthala!—which means [...] "O Hari Vitthala (Vithoba), who has given a boon to Pundalik!" [...] However, according to Zelliot, the sect was founded by Dnyaneshwar (also spelled Jnaneshwar), who was a Brahmin poet and philosopher and flourished during the period 1275–1296. Varkaris also <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> with the saying—Dnyanadev rachila paya—which means [...] "Dnyaneshwar laid the foundation stone".|$|E
500|$|Eminem {{has often}} name-dropped Vanilla Ice in his songs. Starting during taped freestyles {{he did with}} rapper Proof in 1992 where they {{performed}} against each other portraying Ice and MC Hammer, respectively. In his first single [...] "Just Don't Give a Fuck", Eminem mentions Ice alongside Everlast, boasting in a playful manner that he's a better rapper. In [...] "Role Model", Eminem says he ripped out Vanilla Ice's dreadlocks. Ice responded to in a magazine interview with Vibe saying that Eminem [...] "raps like a girl". While Vanilla Ice and Eminem neither look at their responses as an actual beef, Eminem did reply to the quote in his song [...] "Marshall Mathers" [...] which also featured a verbal attack on the Insane Clown Posse. Eminem mentioned Ice again in the song [...] "Purple Pills" [...] in 2001, which caused Vanilla Ice's only response in song. On his album Bi-Polar, Ice mentions Eminem {{in a positive light}} ("Hip Hop Rules") and in a negative light ("Exhale"), however, Ice stated that he has no bad feelings towards Eminem. In a 2002 interview, Vanilla Ice stated that he thought Eminem's references were flattering, going on to say [...] "I <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit,</b> I think he’s talented, I think he’s a killer rapper, you know I don’t compare myself to him because he’s another white rapper, I don't compare myself to any other rapper period, I don’t colorize hip hop, it’s stupid, but for people who are doing that are just looking {{through the eyes of a}} racial standpoint, and it really shouldn’t be looked at that way, you’re looking at two musicians that are in a broad brand of hip hop, so you don’t need to compare us two. Following me, any white rapper is going to have to hear 'oh, you think you’re Vanilla Ice?', so I am sure he’s heard that." [...] In April 2009, Ice appeared in the music video for Eminem's song [...] "We Made You". In the 2011 single [...] "Fast Lane", Eminem raps about riding in his car while listening to [...] "Ice Ice Baby".|$|E
500|$|Tierney in 2006 {{assembled}} {{a group of}} investors to form Philadelphia Media Holdings LLC, a group started with the purpose of buying The Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News. Chief executive of Philadelphia Media Holdings, Mr. Tierney also became the publisher of the Philadelphia Inquirer shortly after Philadelphia Media Holdings bought the paper. Initially, there were concerns about Tierney's neutrality because of earlier roles he held working in Republican politics and clashes he had with some reporters. But Mr. Tierney calmed those fears by hiring respected journalist and two-time Pulitzer Prize winner William K. Marimow as editor of The Inquirer and by signing a pledge not to interfere with the editorial content of the two newspapers. Under Mr. Marimow, the editorial quality of The Inquirer improved as the paper returned to its roots by doing more investigative stories. Initially, circulation increased in 2007 and advertising sales improved. Meanwhile, the Daily News won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for investigative journalism for a series of stories on corrupt Philadelphia cops. However, the 2008 financial crisis led to a steep drop in advertising revenue. At the same time, circulation dropped as more readers migrated to the Internet. Newspaper values across the country plummeted by 90 percent or more. Mr. Tierney's group bought the paper {{at the top of the}} market and was saddled with a heavy debt burden. As a result, Philadelphia Media Holdings was forced to file for bankruptcy protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On April 28, 2010, the Philadelphia Inquirer, Daily News and philly.com were sold at a bankruptcy auction to a group of the original lenders, hedge funds and vulture investors led by Angelo Gordon & Company for $139 million. Mr. Tierney stepped down from his position as CEO of the company on May 21, 2010 in order to allow for a smooth transition. Several news accounts of his tenure have called him an [...] "improbable savior" [...] and an [...] "unlikely warrior." [...] Other accounts have said, [...] "For Tierney...his tenure as CEO by many measures could be rated a success." [...] and [...] "As for Tierney, <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> for trying." ...|$|E

2500|$|Controversy arose {{over the}} drug [...] "Celebrex". Brigham Young University (BYU) {{said that a}} {{professor}} of chemistry, Dr. Daniel L. Simmons, discovered an enzyme in the 1990s that would later lead towards the development of Celebrex. BYU was originally seeking 15% royalty on sales, which would equate to $9.7 billion. The court filings show that a research agreement was made with Monsanto, whose pharmaceutical business was later acquired by Pfizer, to develop a better aspirin. The enzyme that Dr. Simmons claims to have discovered would induce pain and inflammation while causing gastrointestinal problems, which Celebrex is used to reduce those issues. A battle ensued, lasting over six years, because BYU claimed that Pfizer did not <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> or compensation while Pfizer claims it had met all obligations regarding the Monsanto agreement. This culminated in a $450 million amicable settlement without going to trial. Pfizer {{said it would take}} a $450 million charge against first quarter earnings to settle.|$|E
2500|$|The early 1950s {{literature}} transformed blitzkrieg into {{a historical}} military doctrine, which carried {{the signature of}} Liddell Hart and Guderian. The main evidence of Liddell Hart's deceit and [...] "tendentious" [...] report of history {{can be found in}} his letters to Erich von Manstein, Heinz Guderian and the relatives and associates of Erwin Rommel. Liddell Hart, in letters to Guderian, [...] "imposed his own fabricated version of blitzkrieg on the latter and compelled him to proclaim it as original formula". Kenneth Macksey found Liddell Hart's original letters to Guderian in the General's papers, requesting that Guderian <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> for [...] "impressing him" [...] with his ideas of armoured warfare. When Liddell Hart was questioned about this in 1968 and the discrepancy between the English and German editions of Guderian's memoirs, [...] "he gave a conveniently unhelpful though strictly truthful reply.

[...] Héron de Villefosse denounced Haussmann's central market, Les Halles, as [...] "a hideous eruption" [...] of cast iron. [...] Describing Haussmann's renovation of the Île de la Cité, he wrote: [...] "the old ship of Paris was torpedoed by Baron Haussmann and sunk during his reign. It was perhaps the greatest crime of the megalomaniac prefect and also his biggest mistake...His work caused more damage than a hundred bombings. It was in part necessary, and one should <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> for his self-confidence, but he was certainly lacking culture and good taste...In the United States, it would be wonderful, but in our capital, which he covered with barriers, scaffolds, gravel, and dust for twenty years, he committed crimes, errors, and showed bad taste." ...|$|E

2500|$|Much as Dmitry disliked his tight upper-lipped, stone-faced dad, {{later he}} had to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> for being {{the first one to}} have noticed and, in his emotionless way, {{appreciate}} his first poetic exercises. In July 1879, in Alupka, Crimea, Sergey Ivanovich introduced Dmitry to the legendary Princess Yekaterina [...] Vorontzova, once Pushkin's sweetheart. The grand dame admired the boy's verses: she (according to a biographer) [...] "spotted in them a must-have poetic quality: the metaphysical sensitivity of a young soul" [...] and encouraged him to soldier on. Somewhat different was young Merezhkovsky's encounter with another luminary, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, staged by his well-connected father again. As the boy started reciting his work, nervous to the point of stuttering, the famous novelist listened rather impatiently, then said: [...] "Poor, very poor. To write well, one has to suffer. Suffer!" [...] – [...] "Oh no, I'd rather he won't – either suffer, or write well!", the appalled father exclaimed. The boy left Dostoyevsky's house much frustrated by the great man's verdict. Merezhkovsky's debut publication followed the same year: Saint Petersburg magazine Zhivopisnoye Obozrenye published two of his poems, [...] "Little Cloud" [...] and [...] "The Autumn Melody". A year later another poem [...] "Narcissus" [...] was included in a charity compilation benefiting destitute students, edited by Pyotr Yakubovich.|$|E
2500|$|Affectionately nicknamed [...] "Go" [...] and towering at {{a whopping}} five-foot [...] "ape", the Gorilla is the Phoenix Suns {{favorite}} primate. Most notably, fans {{are familiar with}} the Gorilla for his on the court antics where he raises the Phoenix Suns flag in the name of team-pride, performs notorious slam dunk routines and fires up the crowd. From his early days in the Banana Republic to his education at Fur-man University, the Gorilla has always had a passion for basketball. Before his debut with the Phoenix Suns, the Gorilla delivered singing telegrams. However, in 1980 the Gorilla's fate changed when he stepped onto the court during a game and surprised unsuspecting players and fans. His antics became an instant hit and the Gorilla {{has been a member of}} the Phoenix Suns ever since. Since then, the gorilla, has been known for his slapstick humor during the games such as his stadium stairs all to the sound of the Rocky Theme, and the fantastic dunks that are performed before each 4th quarter. The Gorilla would do a few push-ups on the court, then head off in a quest to climb the stairs of both the lower and upper level of the Coliseum to get to the top. When he reached the base of the upper level, he’d stop for a second to soak up the applause, then head to the top of the building. When he got there, the crowd would explode. It never failed. Also, one of his more beloved skits was at a Knicks home game where he came out to Frank Sinatra's Theme from New York, wearing a hat, with several pieces of garbage stuck to his leg. Halfway through the song, a group of [...] "muggers" [...] attacked him, and he staggered off the court afterwards. <b>Give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit,</b> The Gorilla has always been more than a slapstick comedian. In a way, though, that's what makes The Gorilla so much fun. He's not really there just to cheer on the Suns – although he does so with great enthusiasm. The Gorilla just wants to have fun, and wants the rest of us to have fun with him.|$|E
