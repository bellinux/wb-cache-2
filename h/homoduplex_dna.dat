It is therefore important to monitor the development and spread of rifampin resistant strains to enable clinicians to prescribe the appropriate anti-tubercular drugs. The discovery in recent years of the mutant rpoB gene representing rifampin resistance has {{led to the development of}} a molecular approach for the rapid detection of rifampin resistant isolates. This study utilizes this molecular approach, called the PCR-HDF and demonstrates, for the first time, the utility of such assay in the Philippines. Twelve clinical isolates positive for M. tuberculosis with variable susceptibility patterns by the conventional method were used. All rifampin susceptible isolates exhibited <b>homoduplex</b> <b>DNA</b> only.

40|$|The most {{abundant}} mismatch binding factor in human cells, hMutSalpha, is a heterodimer of hMSH 2 and hMSH 6, two homologues of the bacterial MutS protein. The C-terminal portions of all MutS homologues contain an ATP binding motif and are highly conserved throughout evolution. Although the N termini are generally divergent, they too contain short conserved sequence elements. A phenylalanine [...] > alanine substitution within one such motif, GXFY(X) (5) DA, {{has been shown}} to abolish the mismatch binding activity of the MutS protein of Thermus aquaticus (Malkov, V. A., Biswas, I., Camerini-Otero, R. D., and Hsieh, P. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 23811 - 23817). We introduced an identical mutation into one or both subunits of hMutSalpha. The Phe [...] > Ala substitution in hMSH 2 had no effect on the biological activity of the heterodimer. In contrast, the in vitro mismatch binding and mismatch repair functions of hMutSalpha were severely attenuated when the hMSH 6 subunit was mutated. Moreover, this variant heterodimer also displayed a general DNA binding defect. Correspondingly, its ATPase activity could not be stimulated by either heteroduplex or <b>homoduplex</b> <b>DNA.</b> Thus the N-terminal portion of hMSH 6 appears to impart on hMutSalpha not only the specificity for recognition and binding of mismatched substrates but also the ability to bind to <b>homoduplex</b> <b>DNA...</b>|$|E
40|$|Heteroduplex {{molecules}} of pneumococcal DNA, prepared by cross-annealing resolved complementary strands, {{have been used}} as donors in transformation. A number of pairs of genetic markers are situated exclusively in the trans configuration in these heteroduplexes. Insertion of two markers from trans configuration into opposite DNA strands of a recipient genome should result in their segregation after one replication cycle. As a consequence, doubly transformed progeny would not appear, or would be markedly decreased. Contrary to these expectations, transformations with the heteroduplex DNAs give as many doubly transformed progeny for unlinked marker pairs as do <b>homoduplex</b> <b>DNAs.</b> For a pair of markers that normally are weakly linked, the frequencies of cotransfer are actually greater than those observed for a mixture of two singly marked <b>homoduplex</b> <b>DNAs.</b> These results lead {{to the conclusion that the}} heteroduplex DNAs are acted upon by repair enzymes of recipient cells so that markers introduced in the trans configuration are frequently converted to the cis configuration, either before or during integration.

The method is based on the difference in mobility of mutant DNA (in the same length) in PAGE, which is due to Zn 2 +–cyclen binding to thymine bases accompanying a total charge decrease and a local conformation change of target DNA. Various nucleotide substitutions (e. g. AT to GC) in DNA fragments (up to 150 bp) can be visualized with ethidium bromide staining. Furthermore, heteroduplex and <b>homoduplex</b> <b>DNAs</b> are clearly separated as different bands in the gel.

In eukaryotes, the {{mismatch repair}} complex MSH 2 –MSH 6 binds to mispairs with only slightly higher affinity than to fully paired DNA in vitro. Recently, the high-mobility group box 1 protein, (HMGB 1), {{has been shown}} to stimulate the mismatch repair reaction in vitro. In yeast, the closest homologs of HMGB 1 are NHP 6 A and NHP 6 B.

Binding of the yeast MSH 2 –MSH 6 to <b>homoduplex</b> regions of <b>DNA</b> significantly stimulates the loading of NHP 6 A. Upon binding of NHP 6 A to DNA, MSH 2 –MSH 6 is excluded from binding unless a mismatch is present. A DNA binding-impaired MSH 2 –MSH 6 F 337 A significantly reduced the loading of NHP 6 A to DNA, suggesting that MSH 2 –MSH 6 binding is a requisite for NHP 6 A loading. MSH 2 –MSH 6 and NHP 6 A form a stable complex, which is responsive to ATP on mismatched substrates.

Parallel processing of sequencing libraries was aided by unique tracer sequences and barcodes allowing flexibility in the number and pooling arrangement of targeted genes, species, and pooling scheme. Sequencing reads were processed and aligned to the reference to identify possible single-nucleotide changes, which were then evaluated for frequency, sequencing quality, intersection pattern in pools, and statistical relevance to produce a Bayesian score with an associated confidence threshold.

The remaining seven serovars each contained multiple RS/HP types, which were also unique to individual serovars. Formation of heteroduplex structures with a substantially reduced electrophoretic mobility was observed in 29 of the 36 RS/HP pattern types. Because the mobility of these heteroduplex structures is sensitive to intergenic spacer sequence composition, {{the presence of these}} structures adds an additional diagnostic feature that is extremely useful in the differentiation of Salmonella serovars.

The assay involves {{only a limited number}} of steps and can be performed in less than 4 h, including the initial PCR. After PCR, the <b>homoduplex</b> double-stranded <b>DNA</b> (dsDNA) is denatured and reannealed under stringent conditions.

As an example, we employed DiVE to monitor the diversity of panning rounds from a single-framework, semisynthetic single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) phage display library. The results are in good agreement with the observed decrease in diversity in phage display panning rounds toward the selection of monoclonal scFv.

50|$|The {{temperature}} gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) or {{temperature gradient}} capillary electrophoresis (TGCE) method {{is based on}} the principle that partially denatured DNA is more restricted and travels slower in a porous material such as a gel. This property allows for the separation of DNA by melting temperature. To adapt these methods for SNP detection, two fragments are used; the target DNA which contain the SNP polymorphic site being interrogated and an allele-specific DNA sequence, referred to as the normal DNA fragment. The normal fragment is identical to the target DNA except potentially at the SNP polymorphic site, which is unknown in the target DNA. The fragments are denatured and then reannealed. If the target DNA has the same allele as the normal fragment, homoduplexes will form that will have the same melting temperature. When run on the gel with a temperature gradient, only one band will appear. If the target DNA has a distinct allele, four products will form following the reannealing step; homoduplexes consisting of target <b>DNA,</b> <b>homoduplexes</b> consisting of normal DNA and two heterduplexes of each strand of target DNA hybridized with the normal DNA strand.

For genetic map-ping experiments, TGCE has a number of advantages over alternative heteroduplex-detection technologies such as celery endonuclease (CELI) and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC). Multiplexing can increase TGCE’s throughput to 12 markers on 94 recombinant inbreds per day.

The mechanism by which MutS searches for and recognizes mismatches and subsequently signals repair remains poorly understood. We used single-molecule analyses of atomic force microscopy images of MutS-DNA complexes, coupled with biochemical assays, to determine the distributions of conformational states, the DNA binding affinities, and the ATPase activities of wild type and two mutants of MutS, with alanine substitutions in the conserved Phe-Xaa-Glu mismatch recognition motif.

In addition, formation of the specific unbent MutS-DNA conformation at mismatches appears to be required for the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by MutS that signals initiation of repair.

To facili-tate the screening, a method is proposed to eliminate wild type sequences and increase mutated DNA sequences, which is based on the preferential binding of MutS protein to heteroduplex DNA.

In the case of foldback quadruplexes, the effects of different cations on quadruplex formation by the oligonucleotides d(TG 4 T 4 G 4 T) were studied and results were compared with d(G 4 T 4 G 4). The oligonucleotide displayed structural polymorphism in low, Na+ concentration. The quadruplex formed by d(TG 4 T 4 G 4 T) in the presence of K+ was more stabilized than in the presence of Na+. The 23 Na NMR line shape was bi-Lorentzian suggesting rapid exchange of the specifically bound Na + from the quadruplex core. ^ Trinucleotide repeats are involved in several human neurodegenarative, diseases such as Fragile X Syndrome.

It is initiated by the recognition of base–base mismatches and insertion/deletion loops by the family of MutS proteins. Subsequently, ATP induces a unique conformational change in the MutS–mismatch complex but not in the MutS–homoduplex complex that sets off the cascade of events that leads to repair. To gain insight into the mechanism by which MutS discriminates between mismatch and <b>homoduplex</b> <b>DNA,</b> we have examined the conformations of specific and nonspecific MutS–DNA complexes by using atomic force microscopy. Interestingly, MutS–DNA complexes exhibit a single population of conformations, in which the DNA is bent at homoduplex sites, but two populations of conformations, bent and unbent, at mismatch sites. These results suggest that the specific recognition complex is one in which the DNA is unbent. Combining our results with existing biochemical and crystallographic data leads us to propose that MutS: (i) binds to DNA nonspecifically and bends it in search of a mismatch; (ii) on specific recognition of a mismatch, undergoes a conformational change to an initial recognition complex in which the DNA is kinked, with interactions similar to those in the published crystal structures; and (iii) finally undergoes a further conformational change to the ultimate recognition complex in which the DNA is unbent. Our results provide a structural explanation for the long-standing question of how MutS achieves {{mismatch repair}} specificity...|$|E
40|$|In the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Msh 2 p-Msh 6 p complex, {{mutations}} {{that were}} predicted to disrupt ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, or both activities in each subunit were created. Mutations in either subunit {{resulted in a}} mismatch repair defect, and overexpression of either mutant subunit in a wild-type strain resulted in a dominant negative phenotype. Msh 2 p-Msh 6 p complexes bearing one or both mutant subunits were analyzed for binding to DNA containing base pair mismatches. None of the mutant complexes displayed a significant defect in mismatch binding; however, unlike wild-type protein, all mutant combinations continued to display mismatch binding specificity {{in the presence of}} ATP and did not display ATP-dependent conformational changes as measured by limited trypsin protease digestion. Both wild-type complex and complexes defective in the Msh 2 p ATPase displayed ATPase activities that were modulated by mismatch and <b>homoduplex</b> <b>DNA</b> substrates. Complexes defective in the Msh 6 p ATPase, however, displayed weak ATPase activities that were unaffected by the presence of DNA substrate. The results from these studies suggest that the Msh 2 p and Msh 6 p subunits of the Msh 2 p-Msh 6 p complex play important and coordinated roles in postmismatch recognition steps that involve ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, our data support a model whereby Msh 6 p uses its ATP binding or hydrolysis activity to coordinate mismatch binding with additional mismatch repair components...|$|E
40|$|Plasmid heteroduplexes were {{constructed}} that contain 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 unpaired bases within the mnt gene. These {{were used to}} assess the efficiency of repair of small heterologous sequences ("heterologies") in DNA by the Escherichia coli Dam-directed mismatch repair system. Heteroduplexes in defined states of methylation at d(GATC) sites were used to transform a repair-proficient indicator strain (which has a mnt-lac fusion coding for a nonfunctional mnt repressor) and its isogenic mutH, -L, and -S derivatives. Using this in vivo transformation system, we scored for repair on the basis of colony color: correction in favor of the strand bearing mnt+ coding information gives rise to colonies that are white, whereas correction on the opposite strand (mnt-) yields colonies that are red when grown on MacConkey agar. Failure to repair a heterology yields colonies that are both red and white ("mixed"). The correction efficiencies of two heteroduplexes, each containing a single G. T mismatch within mnt, were also monitored for purposes of comparison. Our results show that mutHLS-dependent, methyl-directed repair of heteroduplexes with 1 -, 2 -, and 3 -base deletions is as highly efficient as the repair of G. T mismatches. Heteroduplexes with a 4 -base deletion are marginally repaired and DNA with a 5 -base deletion is not detectably repaired. In addition, we show that purified MutS protein from Salmonella typhimurium, which can substitute for E. coli MutS in vivo, binds to oligonucleotide duplexes containing 1, 2, 3, and 4 unpaired bases of a sequence identical with that used for the in vivo studies. Specific binding of MutS to <b>homoduplex</b> <b>DNA</b> and to DNA that had undergone a 5 -base deletion was not observed...|$|E
40|$|MutS, a {{component}} of the mismatch repair system begins the DNA reparation process by recognizing base/base mismatches or small insertion/deletion loops. We have cloned the mutS gene from the human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and analysed the biochemical properties of the encoded protein. Complementation of the hypermutator phenotype of a P. aeruginosa mutS mutant strain indicated that the isolated gene was functional. When purified MutS was incubated at 37 degrees C in the absence of ligands, a rapid inactivation of the oligonucleotide binding capability and ATPase activity occurred. However, the presence of ATP, ADP or heteroduplex oligonucleotides, but not homoduplex oligonucleotides, prevented the protein from being inactivated. The analysis of the protein by native PAGE indicated that the active conformation state correlates with the presence of MutS dimer. Analysis by gel-filtration chromatography showed that the inactive protein formed by incubation at 37 degrees C in the absence of ligands corresponds to the formation of a high molecular mass oligomer. The kinetic analysis of the oligomer formation showed that the extent of the reaction was markedly dependent on the temperature and the presence of MutS ligands. However, the protein inactivation apparently occurred before the maximum extent of MutS oligomerization. Further analysis of the MutS oligomers by electron microscopy showed the presence of regular structures consisting of four subunits, with each subunit probably representing a MutS homodimer. It is concluded that MutS possesses an intrinsic propensity to form oligomeric structures and that the presence of physiological ligands, such as nucleotides or heteroduplex DNA, but not <b>homoduplex</b> <b>DNA,</b> {{plays an important role in}} keeping the protein in an active conformation by preventing protein oligomerization...|$|E
40|$|TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) is {{a useful}} tool for {{discovery}} of specific point mutations in genes of interest to plant breeders. It employs mismatch cleavage detection using endonucleases, particularly CELI and CELII. During PCR annealing, dsDNA heteroduplexes arise in pooled genomic DNA samples containing one or more Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) resulting from, for instance, induced mutation. The cleaved fragments can be distinguished from the larger perfectly-matched <b>homoduplex</b> <b>DNA</b> of the unmutated wild types in the sample of pooled individuals. The ability to efficiently detect individuals with specific mutations within pooled samples provides plant breeders with a powerful screening tool to greatly reduce the numbers of plants requiring phenotypic assessment. Further, it enables geneticists to analyse gene function and associate genotype with phenotype. Such protocols suffer from limited ability to detect mismatch cleavage signal due to non-specific removal, by the nuclease, of 5 ’ end-labelled termini used in the conventional approach. Mutation detection is further limited by high background characteristic of PCR-based end-labelling mismatch scanning techniques. We showed that as nuclease activity increased, internal signal was maintained while 5 ’ signal decayed. Furthermore, internal labelling improved background. The loss of end-signal constitutes a fundamental problem with the conventional approach to mismatch scanning with CEL nucleases. A new mismatch scanning assay called ‘Endonucleolytic Mutation Analysis by Internal Labelling’ (EMAIL), was developed using capillary electrophoresis, involving internal amplicon labelling by PCR incorporation of fluorescently-labelled deoxynucleotides. Multiple mutations amongst allelic pools have been detected when EMAIL was applied with the mismatch nucleases CELI and CELII. This technique offers greatly increased sensitivity in specific-gene mutant detection in pooled samples, enabling enlarged pool sizes and improving throughput and efficiency. We are investigating the limits of pool sizes to deliver a highly efficient mutation detection and analysis strategy for plant breeders and geneticists...|$|E
40|$|Temperature-Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (TGGE) was {{employed}} to determine the thermal stabilities of 28 DNA fragments, 373 bp long, with two adjacent mismatched base pairs, and eight DNAs with Watson– Crick base pairs at the same positions. Heteroduplex DNAs containing two adjacent mismatches were formed by melting and reannealing pairs of homo-logous 373 bp DNA fragments differing by two adjac-ent base pairs. Product DNAs were separated based on their thermal stability by parallel and perpendicular TGGE. The polyacrylamide gel contained 3. 36 M urea and 19. 2 % formamide to lower the DNA melting temperatures. The order of stability was determined in the sequence context d(CXYG) ·d(CY′X′G) where X·X′ and Y·Y ′ represent the mismatched or Watson–Crick base pairs. The identity of the mismatched bases and their stacking interactions influence DNA stability. Mobility transition melting temperatures (Tu) of the DNAs with adjacent mismatches were 1. 0 – 3. 6 C (± 0. 2 C) lower than the <b>homoduplex</b> <b>DNA</b> with the d(CCAG) ·d(CTGG) sequence. Two adjacent G·A pairs, d(CGAG) ·d(CGAG), created a more stable DNA than DNAs with Watson–Crick A·T pairs at the same sites. The d(GA) ·d(GA) sequence {{is estimated to be}} 0. 4 (± 30 %) kcal/mol more stable in free energy than d(AA) ·d(TT) base pairs. This result confirms the unusual stability of the d(GA) ·d(GA) sequence previ-ously observed in DNA oligomers. All other DNAs with adjacent mismatched base pairs were less stable than Watson–Crick homoduplex DNAs. Their relative stabi-lities followed an order expected from previous results on single mismatches. Two homoduplex DNAs with identical nearest neighbor sequences but different next-nearest neighbor sequences had a small but reproducible difference in Tu value. This result indi-cates that sequence dependent next neighbor stack-ing interactions influence DNA stability...|$|E
