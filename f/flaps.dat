40|$|<b>Flapping</b> wing {{propulsion}} has {{the potential}} to revolutionise the field of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), but {{little is known about the}} effect of <b>flapping</b> motion on the performance of <b>flapping</b> wings. Prototype MAVs have achieved flight with passive <b>flapping</b> wings moving in a sinusoidal <b>flapping</b> motion, but the possible benefits of alternative <b>flapping</b> motions have not been studied in detail. This thesis presents the development of an Integrated Testing System (ITS), which allows the evaluation of <b>flapping</b> wing performance for different <b>flapping</b> motions. A detailed parametric study of the effect of <b>flapping</b> motion on wing performance is performed, and the optimal <b>flapping</b> motion for several passive <b>flapping</b> wings is determined by hardware-in-the-loop optimisation of two wing performance metrics. The developed ITS was able to automatically test a variety of passive <b>flapping</b> wings, and demonstrated precise control of the <b>flapping</b> motion and accurate and repeatable measurements of average lift force, mechanical power, and wing twist angle. The parametric study revealed that of the three <b>flapping</b> motions tested, the sinusoidal <b>flapping</b> motion generated the highest lift force, but a smoothed triangular motion was able to generate lift significantly more efficiently under load. The optimal <b>flapping</b> motion was successfully determined for three <b>flapping</b> wings, and was found to increase the loaded efficiency of the wings by an average of 31 % over a sinusoidal <b>flapping</b> motion. The determined optimal motion was almost identical for the three tested wings, and was found to strongly resemble the <b>flapping</b> motion of insects These findings demonstrate that significant improvements in the performance of passive <b>flapping</b> wings can be achieved by relatively minor variations of the <b>flapping</b> motion. This increased understanding will ideally lead to more efficient <b>flapping</b> wing MAVs with higher payloads, longer flight times, and improved performance...|$|R

They also revealed that <b>flap</b> thickness {{plays an important role}} in the behavior of the vortex flow over the <b>flap</b> and wing and can have a substantial effect on wing and <b>flap</b> pressure loading.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a <b>flapping</b> wing mechanism and testing methods {{that can be used to}} determine the forces, moments, and deflections involved in <b>flapping</b> wing aerodynamics. <b>Flapping</b> mechanisms, ranging in wingspan from 9. 1 inches to 12. 1 inches, capable of purely <b>flapping,</b> <b>flapping</b> with pitch, and <b>flapping</b> with pitch and out-of-plane motion were developed in SolidWorks. The one degree of freedom <b>flapping</b> mechanism and the two degree of freedom <b>flapping</b> mechanism were built, and sustained operation was demonstrated. A six-component force balance was used to gather force data from the <b>flapping</b> only mechanism. Four high-speed cameras were used to capture the motion of the <b>flapping</b> mechanism. To minimize intrusiveness an array of laser dots was projected onto the wing during <b>flapping</b> and photogrammetry software was used to analyze the images and determine a shape profile of the wing composed of a frame and membrane during <b>flapping...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{two most}} used {{forehead}} <b>flap</b> techniques {{are the two}} stage and three stage forehead <b>flap.</b> The forehead consists of multiple layers; skin, subcutaneous tissue, frontalis muscle with fascia and a thin areolar layer. Traditionally, the forehead <b>flap</b> is transferred in two stages, where the <b>flap</b> is thinned during the first stage to improve the aesthetic result, possibly jeopardizing its vascularity and increasing chance for <b>flap</b> necrosis. To overcome this problem, Menick described a three stage forehead <b>flap</b> technique, where initially the <b>flap</b> is transferred containing all tissue layers, making it an extremely safe technique. Only during the second stage, the <b>flap</b> - which now acts as a delayed <b>flap</b> - can safely be thinned aggressively according to aesthetic needs. During the final stage the pedicle is severed, the <b>flap</b> is thinned further and pedicle and <b>flap</b> are trimmed and inset. This three stage <b>flap</b> is especially useful for reconstructing large defects, complex contour deformations, or lining defects, while the two stage <b>flap</b> is used for smaller and superficial defects.|$|R
5|$|Elephant ears have thick bases {{with thin}} tips. The ear <b>flaps,</b> or pinnae, contain {{numerous}} blood vessels called capillaries. Warm blood {{flows into the}} capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This occurs when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have the largest ear <b>flaps.</b> Elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 kHz.|$|E

Right eye of each patient had the <b>flap</b> removed (<b>flap</b> off) while in the left eye the <b>flap</b> was recapped (<b>flap</b> on). Equal number (N= 53) of <b>flap</b> on was matched with <b>flap</b> off having preoperative manifest refraction spherical equivalent within Â± 0. 75 Diopters (D). Primary outcome variables included uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) and manifest refraction. ResultsPreoperatively, the mean spherical equivalent (SE) was â 3. 59 Â± 1. 46 D for <b>flap</b> off and â 3. 67 Â± 1. 51 D for <b>flap</b> on (p= 0. 779).

5|$|The airflow {{through the}} main {{radiator}} was controlled by pneumatic exit <b>flaps.</b> In early marks of Spitfire (Mk I to Mk VI) the single flap was operated manually using a lever {{to the left of}} the pilot's seat. When the two-stage Merlin was introduced in the Spitfire Mk IX the radiators were split to make room for an intercooler radiator; the radiator under the starboard wing was halved in size and the intercooler radiator housed alongside. Under the port wing a new radiator fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside of the other half-radiator unit. The two radiator <b>flaps</b> were now operated automatically via a thermostat.|$|E
5|$|The condor soars {{with its}} wings held {{horizontally}} and its primary feathers bent upwards at the tips. The {{lack of a}} large sternum to anchor its correspondingly large flight muscles physiologically identifies it as primarily being a soarer.

Charles Darwin commented on having watched them {{for half an hour}} without once observing a flap of their wings. It prefers to roost on high places from which it can launch without major wing-flapping effort. Andean condors are often seen soaring near rock cliffs, using the heat thermals to aid them in rising in the air.|$|E

To address concerns about safety and flyability, the 747's design included structural redundancy, redundant hydraulic systems, quadruple main landing gear and dual control surfaces. Additionally, some of the most advanced high-lift devices used in the industry were included in the new design, to allow it to operate from existing airports. These included slats running almost {{the entire length of the}} wing, as well as complex three-part slotted <b>flaps</b> along the trailing edge of the wing.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{interaction}} of a wake with a half-span <b>flap</b> on radiated noise are examined. The incident wake is generated by bars of various widths and lengths or by a simplified landing gear model. Single microphone and phased array measurements are used to isolate the {{effects of the}} wake interaction on the noise radiating from the <b>flap</b> side edge and <b>flap</b> cove regions. The effects on noise of the wake generator's geometry and relative placement with respect to the <b>flap</b> are assessed. Placement of the wake generators upstream of the <b>flap</b> side edge is shown to lead to the reduction of <b>flap</b> side edge noise by introducing a velocity deficit and likely altering the instabilities in the <b>flap</b> side edge vortex system. Significant reduction in <b>flap</b> side edge noise is achieved with a bar positioned directly upstream of the <b>flap</b> side edge. The noise reduction benefit is seen to improve with increased bar width, length and proximity to the <b>flap</b> edge. Positioning of the landing gear model upstream of the <b>flap</b> side edge also leads to decreased <b>flap</b> side edge noise. In addition, <b>flap</b> cove noise levels are significantly lower than when the landing gear is positioned upstream of the <b>flap</b> mid-span. The impact of the local flow velocity on the noise radiating directly from the landing gear is discussed.

40|$|PIV {{measurements}} of the flow {{in the region of}} a <b>flap</b> side edge are presented for several blowing <b>flap</b> configurations. The test model is a NACA 63 (sub 2) - 215 Hicks Mod-B main-element airfoil with a half-span Fowler <b>flap.</b> Air is blown from small slots located along the <b>flap</b> side edge on either the top, bottom or side surfaces.

The effects that the <b>flap</b> tip jets have on the structure of the <b>flap</b> side edge flow are discussed for each of the <b>flap</b> configurations tested. The results indicate that blowing air from a slot located along the top surface of the <b>flap</b> greatly weakened the top vortex system and pushed it further off the top surface. Blowing from the bottom <b>flap</b> surface kept the strong side vortex further outboard while blowing from the side surface only strengthened the vortex system or accelerated the merging of the side vortex to the <b>flap</b> top surface.
