5|$|Diamonds {{crystallize}} in {{the diamond}} cubic crystal system (space group Fdm) and consist of tetrahedrally, covalently bonded carbon atoms. A second form called lonsdaleite, with hexagonal symmetry, {{has also been}} found, but it is extremely rare and forms only in meteorites or in laboratory synthesis. The local environment of each atom is identical in the two structures. From theoretical considerations, lonsdaleite {{is expected to be}} harder than diamond, but the size and quality of the available stones are insufficient to test this hypothesis. In terms of crystal habit, diamonds occur most often as <b>euhedral</b> (well-formed) or rounded octahedra and twinned, flattened octahedra with a triangular outline. Other forms include dodecahedra and (rarely) cubes. There is evidence that nitrogen impurities {{play an important role in}} the formation of well-shaped <b>euhedral</b> crystals. The largest diamonds found, such as the Cullinan Diamond, were shapeless. These diamonds are pure (i.e. type II) and therefore contain little if any nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds occur {{most often}} as <b>euhedral</b> or rounded octahedra and twinned octahedra known as macles. As diamond's crystal {{structure}} has a cubic {{arrangement of the}} atoms, they have many facets that belong to a cube, octahedron, rhombicosidodecahedron, tetrakis hexahedron or disdyakis dodecahedron. The crystals can have rounded off and unexpressive edges and can be elongated. Diamonds (especially those with rounded crystal faces) are commonly found coated in nyf, an opaque gum-like skin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Euhedral</b> {{crystals}} {{are those}} with obvious, well-formed flat faces. Anhedral crystals do not, usually because the crystal is one grain in a polycrystalline solid.|$|E
25|$|The {{minerals}} {{within the}} rock include quartz, plagioclase feldspar, microcline and muscovite, with smaller amounts of biotite and tourmaline. The tourmaline is mostly black in color, {{and the majority}} of it exists as optically continuous skeletal crystals, but much larger, <b>euhedral</b> pegmatitic tourmaline crystals can also be found in the mountain's numerous, cross-cutting felsic dikes.|$|E
25|$|Crystal habit {{refers to}} the overall shape of crystal. Several terms are used to {{describe}} this property. Common habits include acicular, which described needlelike crystals like in natrolite, bladed, dendritic (tree-pattern, common in native copper), equant, which is typical of garnet, prismatic (elongated in one direction), and tabular, which differs from bladed habit in that the former is platy whereas the latter has a defined elongation. Related to crystal form, the quality of crystal faces is diagnostic of some minerals, especially with a petrographic microscope. <b>Euhedral</b> crystals have a defined external shape, while anhedral crystals do not; those intermediate forms are termed subhedral.|$|E
25|$|Tourmaline is a six-member ring cyclosilicate {{having a}} {{trigonal}} crystal system. It occurs as long, slender to thick prismatic and columnar crystals {{that are usually}} triangular in cross-section, often with curved striated faces. The style of termination {{at the ends of}} crystals is sometimes asymmetrical, called hemimorphism. Small slender prismatic crystals are common in a fine-grained granite called aplite, often forming radial daisy-like patterns. Tourmaline is distinguished by its three-sided prisms; no other common mineral has three sides. Prisms faces often have heavy vertical striations that produce a rounded triangular effect. Tourmaline is rarely perfectly <b>euhedral.</b> An exception was the fine dravite tourmalines of Yinnietharra, in western Australia. The deposit was discovered in the 1970s, but is now exhausted. All hemimorphic crystals are piezoelectric, and are often pyroelectric as well.|$|E

2500|$|The {{flat faces}} (also called facets) of a <b>euhedral</b> crystal are {{oriented}} {{in a specific}} way relative to the underlying atomic arrangement of the crystal: they are planes of relatively low Miller index. This occurs because some surface orientations are more stable than others (lower surface energy). As a crystal grows, new atoms attach easily to the rougher and less stable parts of the surface, but less easily to the flat, stable surfaces. Therefore, the flat surfaces tend to grow larger and smoother, until the whole crystal surface consists of these plane surfaces. (See diagram on right.) ...|$|E

50|$|Apatite and zircon {{are common}} {{accessory}} minerals, and occur as relatively <b>euhedral</b> crystals. Because {{none of the}} mafic minerals are fractured or bent and the interstitial quartz keeps all axes the same length, the strong orientation shown by the <b>euhedral</b> minerals and the hornblende is viewed to be a magmatic foliation. The absence of well-balanced, 120° facial angles between the minerals indicates that no major readjustment of the grain boundaries took place after the magma had crystallized.|$|E

50|$|In mineralogy, crystal habit is the {{characteristic}} external {{shape of an}} individual crystal or crystal group. A single crystal's habit is a description of its general shape and its crystallographic forms, plus how well developed each form is. Recognizing the habit may help in identifying a mineral. When the faces are well-developed due to uncrowded growth a crystal is called <b>euhedral,</b> one with partially developed faces is subhedral, and one with undeveloped crystal faces is called anhedral. The long axis of a <b>euhedral</b> quartz crystal typically has a six-sided prismatic habit with parallel opposite faces. Aggregates can be formed of individual crystals with <b>euhedral</b> to anhedral grains. The arrangement of crystals within the aggregate can be characteristic of certain minerals. For example, minerals used for asbestos insulation often grow in a fibrous habit, a mass of very fine fibers.|$|E
