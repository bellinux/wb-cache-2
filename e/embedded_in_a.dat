5|$|The basidiospores are 10.5–13.5 by 6.5–8µm with an {{ellipsoid}} shape. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 35–55 by 10–15µm, and four-spored. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) are 70–110 by 25–45µm, fusiform (spindle-shaped), utriform (shaped like a leather bottle) or lageniform (flask shaped); some have an apical excrescence (outgrowth). Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are 60–75 by 15–27µm, commonly fusiform or utriform; they cover completely the gill edge. The cap cuticle is an ixocutis (parallel hyphae <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gelatinous matrix). The stipitipellis is a cutis (parallel hyphae not <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia (cystidia on the stipe surface) are sometimes present, {{and they are}} 100–360 by 10–20µm and mostly cylindrical.|$|E
5|$|The basidiospores are {{ellipsoid}} {{and measure}} 12–16 by 8–9.5µm. Basidia are 20–35 by 7–15µm and usually four-spored, but sometimes two-spored basidia can occur. Pleurocystidia are 60–90 by 20–50µm with variable morphology: club-shaped, fusiform, ovoid, and sometimes {{with a small}} apical papilla. Cheilocystidia are 55–100 by 15–40µm with similar morphology to the pleurocystidia; they completely cover the gill edge. The cap cuticle (pileipellis) is an ixocutis (parallel hyphae wide <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gelatinous matrix). Stipitipellis is a cutis (parallel hyphae not <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia are sometimes present, measuring 70–180 by 10–25µm; they are mostly cylindrical. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E

5|$|On November 12, Jeanne {{weakened}} to a Category 1 hurricane. It {{entered the}} western Gulf of Mexico, and its forward motion diminished as the ridge moved east.

Although Jeanne briefly re-intensified to 70mph (110km/h), an advancing frontal boundary brought dry air over the western Gulf of Mexico. Jeanne weakened to a depression on November 14.

5|$|Pulveroboletus ravenelii {{produces}} an olive-grey to olive-brown spore print. Spores are elliptical to oval, smooth, and measure 8–10 by 4–5μm. The hyphal {{tissue in the}} hymenophore is inamyloid and bilateral, meaning it diverges downward from the flesh {{toward the edge of}} the hymenophore, away from a central strand. The tubes have scattered cystidia on the walls (pleurocystidia) and abundant cystidia on the edges (cheilocystidia). The hyphae in the cap cuticle are arranged as an ixotrichodermium–long and typically multi-celled, with erect hyphae <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gelatinous matrix.

5|$|The spores are 7.5–9 by 6.5–7.5µm, with an {{ellipsoid}} shape. Their surfaces are ornamented with warts and short ridges {{that do not}} form a reticulum (a network of raised net-like ridges on the surface), with ridges up to 1.0µm high. The spores are hyaline (translucent), and amyloid—they absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, and measure 42 by 9µm. The cap cuticle is a modified ixotrichoderm, meaning that the hyphae are <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> slimy or gelatinous layer.|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{ellipsoid}} {{and measure}} 11–16 by 8–11µm. Basidia are 20–40 by 8–16µm; {{they are usually}} four-spored but sometimes two-spored, and, more rarely, one-spored forms can occur. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are absent in most collections; if present they are scarce and similar to the cheilocystidia. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) measure 30–70 by 10–35µm, and are club-, spindle-, or flask-shaped, and usually each one has an apical outgrowth up to 40µm long. The cheilocystidia completely cover the gill edge. In the form acystidiatus (N.C.Pathak) Vizzini & Contu, both pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia are completely absent. The cap cuticle (pileipellis) is an ixocutis (parallel hyphae <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gelatinous matrix). The stipe cuticle (stipitipellis) is a cutis (parallel hyphae not <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia (cystidia on the cap) are sometimes present; they measure 65–140 by 10–25µm, and are mostly cylindrical.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the many}} {{technical}} {{challenges of the}} ion-deposition apparatus was obtaining a sufficiently high ion current (mass deposition rate) while simultaneously decelerating the ions so they could all deposit onto a target electrode <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> balance pan. Experiments with gold showed the ions had to be decelerated to very low energies to avoid sputtering effects—a phenomenon whereby ions {{that had already been}} counted ricochet off the target electrode or even dislodged atoms that had already been deposited. The deposited mass fraction in the 2003 German experiments only approached very close to 100% at ion energies of less than around 1eV (<1km/s for gold).|$|E
5|$|On {{the bottom}} of the skull, the pterygoid is about twice as wide as it is long. At the front of the pterygoid is a small {{projection}} that extends backwards to form a ridge, on either side of which is a furrow-like depression (the choanal groove) containing the choanae. In Theriosuchus, unlike Knoetschkesuchus, the choanae are <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wider bowl-like depression. Additionally, in both species, the bottom surface of the pterygoid is somewhat concave. Extending forward from either side of the pterygoid is the ectopterygoid; in both species, this bone is constricted near the middle to form an hourglass-like shape, but in K. langenbergensis it is also somewhat twisted to the side. The back of the bone is very concave in both species.|$|E

Shen also wrote that since petrified bamboos were found underground in a dry northern climate zone where they had never been known to grow, climates naturally shifted geographically over time.|$|E

5|$|The 1761 Milestone is a {{milestone}} on 640 South Main Street in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. The stone originally marked {{the junction of}} a Colonial highway from Great Road and an east-west route from Boston, Massachusetts, {{to the state of}} Connecticut. The stone was rediscovered during the installation of an electrical road (likely a tram). In 1898, the stone was reportedly restored to its original location by the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The stone is <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> low retaining wall at the corner of South Main Street and Smithfield Road.

5|$|The game {{begins as}} three {{boys from the}} small Potos village disobey their Elder's {{instructions}} and trespass into a local waterfall, where a treasure {{is said to be}} kept. One of the boys stumbles and falls into the lake, where he finds a rusty sword <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stone. Guided by a disembodied voice, he pulls the sword free, inadvertently unleashing monsters in the surrounding countryside of the village. The villagers interpret the sword's removal as a bad omen and banish the boy from Potos forever. A traveling knight named Jema recognizes the blade as the legendary Mana Sword and encourages the hero to re-energize it by visiting the eight Mana Temples.|$|E
5|$|Third, the {{curvature}} index k determines {{the sign of}} the mean spatial curvature of spacetime averaged over sufficiently large length scales (greater than about a billion light years). If k=1, {{the curvature}} is positive and the Universe has a finite volume. Such universes are often visualized as a three-dimensional sphere <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> four-dimensional space. Conversely, if k is zero or negative, the Universe has infinite volume. It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when R=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when k does not equal 1. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a torus is finite in both. A toroidal Universe could behave like a normal Universe with periodic boundary conditions.|$|E
