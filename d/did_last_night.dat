2500|$|Leaving {{his wife}} and son, Clark began {{the first of his}} diaries a month before the First Fleet {{departed}} Portsmouth, on 13 May 1787. The writing in the diaries is very personal and informal, and was never intended for publication. Clark was extremely homesick, and longed to see {{his wife and}} son, writing as early as {{the second day of the}} voyage: [...] "Oh my God all my hoppes [...] are over of seeing my beloved wife and son". Like many of his fellow officers, he was aggrieved at the level of comfort and support offered to the convicts, noting [...] "I believe few Marines or Soldiers going out on a foreign Service under Government were ever better, if so well provided for as these Convicts are". On arrival in Botany Bay, Clark was dismayed at the unsuitable conditions, which were far from what had been promised in England: [...] "if we are obliged to settle here there will not a soul be alive in the course of a year". With the site for settlement subsequently moved to Sydney Cove, Clark remained distressed by the living conditions experienced by himself and his fellow officers, expressing in a letter to his family in England: [...] "I never slept worse, my dear wife, than I <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> what with the hard cold ground, spiders, ants and every vermin you can think of was crawling over me". During the colony's early years, little food was produced, and the rations brought from England were soon consumed, leaving the colony in near starvation. Clark wrote [...] "God help us. If some ships dont [...] arrive, I dont know what will". Supplies finally arrived in June 1790, on Lady Juliana.|$|E
6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH, without {{regarding}} him: [...] "If {{you could}} mortify me before a whole roomful of people, as you <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> what could I expect after marriage but continual insult?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{back and}} tell us {{as soon as you}} can," [...] {{commanded}} Mrs. Joyce. [...] "I'm crazy to know what he <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> and what he really thinks of us?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It is sweet," [...] she said. She asked curiously: [...] "What <b>did</b> you <b>do</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> {{after you}} left me? I can't guess, though I daresay you can guess what I did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "George," [...] returns Mr. Bucket, {{keeping his}} {{forefinger}} going, [...] "it is certainly possible, because it's the case. This deed was <b>done</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> at ten o'clock. Now, {{you know where}} you were <b>last</b> <b>night</b> at ten o'clock, and you'll be able to prove it, no doubt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{how is it}} to be done?" [...] Bellamy asked. [...] "He {{must have}} arrived in London when you <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> How is it they are not already at the Embassy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Cam. Then, sweet sir, have pity on my frailty; for if my {{lady has}} the least inkling {{of what we}} <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> the poor coachman will be turned away. [...] [Exit after her Lady.|$|E
6000|$|... "The ol' man rather gits {{the laugh}} on y' there, gents," [...] called Robie {{from the other}} side of the counter. [...] "I hain't seen the old skeesix play better'n he <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> in years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The child speaks truth," [...] said he. [...] "All {{this was}} <b>done</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> and I have counted seventy tracks {{crossing}} the river. See, Sahib, where Pudmini's leg-iron cut {{the bark of}} that tree! Yes; she was there too." ...|$|R
60|$|OCTAVIUS. [self-reproachfully] I was brute {{enough to}} <b>do</b> so <b>last</b> <b>night.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{insisted that}} Wilding and Grey should shake hands before the {{breaking}} up of that most astounding council, {{and as he}} had <b>done</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> he now again imposed upon them his commands that they must not allow this matter to go further.|$|R
60|$|JULIA (trying her {{theatrical}} {{method in}} a milder form--reasonable and impulsively goodnatured instead of tragic). I know I {{was wrong to}} act as I <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> I beg your pardon. I am sorry. I was mad.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't think you're mad,' she said, quietly. 'I {{only think}} you're too quixotic. You're {{sorry for me}} and you are letting a kind impulse carry you away, as you <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> at the casino. It's like you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are big, Dan; {{but they}} are not so angry. The heads are not {{breaking}} over as they <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> and the boat will go better over these long waves than she did through the choppy sea {{at the beginning of the}} gale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} you were <b>doing</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> when {{you ought to have}} been in bed?" [...] the old lady began, with a treacherous amiability of manner. [...] "Oh, I am not mistaken! your door was open, my dear, and I looked in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Could {{anything}} {{be working}} more to our advantage, lad? It {{must be that}} our people understand somewhat of that which was <b>done</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> for they are sending their iron messengers into this village with more of fury and determination than since the siege began." ...|$|R
60|$|Both boys laughed, and Alfred {{asked why}} he had not <b>done</b> it <b>last</b> <b>night.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Because he is a mean-spirited, selfish man. If he were not, {{he could}} not have talked as he <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> Because you do not love him, Mildred, you cannot love such a man as that, if he were fifty times a member of the Government." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{sometimes}} you dislike her; often you avoid her. Shirley can feel {{when she is}} slighted and shunned. If you had not walked home in the company you <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> {{you would have been}} a different girl to-day. What time did you reach the rectory?" ...|$|E
60|$|Tommy the Song. What way can {{you care}} him, Sibby? It's {{no way to}} have him lying out on the {{roadside}} under guano bags, like ourselves, and the rain coming down on him like it <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> It's in hospital he'll be for the next month.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{they are}} in the wolf's mouth now. This {{business}} was <b>done</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> The place was stormed by a war-party of a hundred and fifty men. This morning they left and went north upon foot. They have been cached among the woods all day between Poitou and Sainte Marie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, {{let me say}} my say. I have no {{fears of}} your repeating it. I think devil's work has been <b>done</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> upon those {{innocent}} poor people. That old baron got only what he deserved. If I had my way, all his kind {{should have the same}} luck." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} 'cause {{of what was}} <b>done</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> Dan?" [...] Seth asked, {{surprised}} that his roommate should have learned of the affair so soon, and Joe Black gave way to his mirth, although why he thought there was anything comical in what had been said, neither of the boys understood.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{be careful}} that your monkey don't get out again, an' go to cuttin' up as he <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> for I shall get {{provoked}} with him if he hurts my ducks any more," [...] and, with this bit of advice, Aunt Olive went up-stairs to see Abner.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{begin to}} {{understand}} you, Chippewa; you wish {{me to believe that}} YOU are a friend to America, and that the Pottawatamie is not. If this be so, why have you held the speech that you <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> and seemed to be on a war-path AGAINST my countrymen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] Forrest said. [...] "Let us {{take it for}} granted, then, {{that he did it}} {{only because}} he {{preferred}} to play with me to playing against me. What is to become of our little scheme if we cut as we <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> all the time?" ...|$|E
60|$|My {{preparations}} {{for a certain}} murder that I had to <b>do</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> have rendered me unfit for letter-writing these last few days, or you would have heard from me sooner. The crime being completely off my mind and the blood spilled, I am (like many of my fellow-criminals) in a highly edifying state to-day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well;--yes. I {{could not}} <b>do</b> so <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> and I shall {{be back in}} London either to-night or before you are up to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{asked him}} how it came about that he still hunted with the wolves as he had <b>done</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> He {{answered}} that now he was great {{and there was nothing}} more to win, and at times a weariness of life came upon him, and then he must up, and together with Galazi hunt and harry with the wolves, for thus only could he find rest.|$|R
60|$|He {{nodded and}} handed it to one of his men, who {{departed}} in the direction of our huts. So, thought I to myself, Nombe knows all about this business, which means that it is being worked by Zikali. That is why she spoke to me as she <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{you think}} over what I've said," [...] his aunt called after him. [...] "Ye've gotter git a wife soon, however ye manage it. 'Twon't {{be so hard}} if ye're reasonable. Don't stay out as late as ye <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> Ye coughed all night. Where was ye--down at the shore?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{would be}} much better if you would not be so hypocritical, Captain Wybrow. I am {{confident}} there has been some flirtation between you. Miss Sarti, in her position, would never speak to you with the petulance she <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> if you had not given her some kind of claim on you.' ...|$|E
60|$|A {{pantomime}} {{was being}} <b>done</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> {{in the place}} where I am to read to-night. It is something between a theatre, a circus, a riding-school, a Methodist chapel, and a cow-house. I was so disgusted with its acoustic properties on going in to look at it, that the whole unfortunate staff have been all day, and now are, sticking up baize and carpets in it to prevent echoes.|$|R
60|$|The mouth {{smiled as}} it had <b>done</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> when first she {{caught sight of the}} ludicrous {{apparition}} of one philosopher astride on the shoulders of the other, the eyes looked grave as they had done when she humbly, yet gracefully begged pardon for her levity. The chin was uplifted {{as it had}} been <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> when she made with haughty condescension her offers of patronage to the penniless adventurer, and there was the little hand soft and smooth as the petal of a rose which had rested for one moment against his lips.|$|R
6000|$|The Duke {{grasped the}} boy by the shoulder, and, {{directly}} impending over him, stared {{down into his}} face, 'Did you see anything strange <b>done</b> here <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> I say?' ...|$|R
