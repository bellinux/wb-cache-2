A good example is very popular Finnish underground rap artist ASA (formerly known as MC Avain), who has used folk-artists as the accompanying band. Of bands such as Profeetta ja UMU it is very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>what</b> genre they represent.|$|E
500|$|Rowan Kaiser, of The A.V. Club, gave a mixed {{review of}} the episode, commenting on the show's {{increasing}} focus on rape. He wrote that [...] "There are things that I appreciate about the focus on rape. [...] It's fairly rare for a show to treat rape from the victim's perspective." [...] However, {{he went on to}} state that he had [...] "pretty significant issues" [...] with the subject matter as well. He also disapproved of the killer's choice of victims, setting, and new characters, especially Piz. Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B". Reviewer Alan Sepinwall was fairly positive towards the episode. He was mixed towards the inclusion of the Kendall-Keith-Cormac storyline in the premiere, but he also praised the new cast members: [...] "Piz and Parker both add new colors to the gang, though it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> Parker will be like post-rape." [...] He eventually called the episode a [...] "pretty good start".|$|E
2500|$|Reviewing {{the world}} premiere, Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle lauded The Classical Style as an [...] "exuberantly witty and often {{touching}} one-act opera" [...] and wrote, [...] "There has {{been plenty of}} musicology written about opera, the brilliant pianist and writer Jeremy Denk points out, but never an opera about musicology. Now he and composer Steven Stucky have rectified that oversight in glorious fashion." [...] Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times similarly called it an [...] "illuminating, academic, occasionally combative, close study of the musical style of Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven by a brilliant pianist and scholar who died in 2012." [...] Richard Scheinin of the San Jose Mercury News declared it a [...] "winning little opera" [...] and further described it as [...] "gorgeous to hear, and filled with laughs." [...] Reviewing the New York City premiere, Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times wrote, [...] "It’s <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> the future holds for The Classical Style. But even those who lack understanding of the rudiments of harmony would surely enjoy it, while also learning something in the most entertaining way." [...] Simon Williams of Opera News also praised the work, saying: ...|$|E
2500|$|In higher dimensions, {{it becomes}} <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> one means by [...] "constructing" [...] the objects. Clearly, in a 3-dimensional universe, it is {{impossible}} to build a physical model of an object having 4 or more dimensions. There are several approaches normally taken to overcome this matter.|$|R

60|$|Nearly an hour passed, the day {{seeming to}} grow warmer and more oppressive, and a nervous {{headache}} coming on. Poor Violet! {{she was still}} a frightened child, and when she saw Theodora coming down with her bonnet on, the fluttering of her heart made her call so feeble that Theodora supposed her ill, and came to her with kind solicitude that rendered it still <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> she knew would be taken as an affront.|$|R

50|$|Though the Gurjaras held a {{considerable}} territory in South Gujarát their plates seem {{to show they}} were not independent rulers. The general titles are either Samadhigata-panchamaháśabada ‘He who has attained the five great titles,’ or Sámanta Feudatory. In one instance Jayabhaṭa III who was probably a powerful ruler is called Sámantádhipati Lord of Feudatories. It is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> suzerain these Broach Gurjaras acknowledged fealty. Latterly {{they seem to have}} accepted the Chalukyas on the south as their overlords. But during the greater part of their existence they may have been feudatories of the Maitraka dynasty, who were probably Gurjaras who passed from Málwa to South Gujarát and thence by sea to Vallabhi leaving a branch in South Gujarát.|$|R

His almost-country style voice also blends with darker rock lyrics in the new single Fly."

It is my opinion, the people will either continue in that situation, or {{find some way to}} extricate themselves, perhaps by generally agreeing to proceed in the courts without stamps.|$|E
60|$|On {{looking back}} to the entry {{referring}} to the lawyer's visit, we found that my recollection of the two alternatives presented was accurately correct.

60|$|It {{would be}} <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> answer Bertram expected; indeed, {{he had no}} expectations.

His heart was then turned rather to worship at that other shrine: it had been her own words, her own eloquence in favour of the world's greatness, that had drawn him on.

6000|$|Nevertheless {{it was not}} {{the same}} as the days that had gone before, {{although}} it would have been <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in <b>what</b> the difference consisted. Perhaps it was that they seemed to be waiting for something. There were certainly fewer things to be done than usual. People drifted through the drawing-room--Mr. Flushing, Mr. and Mrs. Thornbury. They spoke very apologetically in low tones, refusing to sit down, but remaining for a considerable time standing up, although the only thing they had <b>to</b> <b>say</b> was, [...] "Is there anything we can do?"
