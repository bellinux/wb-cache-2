50|$|In {{many respects}} the W. T. Preston {{is similar to}} the Samson V, a former Canadian Department of Public Works snagboat now {{preserved}} as a museum in New Westminster, British Columbia. Sternwheeler machinery was simple and rugged and often outlasted the shallow-draughted hulls of the vessels. When the Samson V was built in 1937 it <b>incorporated</b> <b>engines</b> and a paddlewheel shaft from the Samson II of 1905, A-frame crane components from the Samson III of 1914 and the steam-winch from the Samson IV of 1924. Like the W. T. Preston, the Samson V maintained waterways for navigation and when retired in 1980, she was the last steam-powered paddlewheeler running in Canada.|$|R
50|$|The I-Novae {{engine is}} the game engine under {{development}} by I-Novae Studios. The I-Novae <b>engine</b> <b>incorporates</b> a graphics <b>engine</b> with an advanced terrain engine.

50|$|The Saxon Class III b were German steam {{locomotives}} {{built for}} the Royal Saxon State Railways (Königlich Sächsische Staatseisenbahnen) in the late 19th century as tender locomotives for express train duties. In 1925, the Deutsche Reichsbahn <b>incorporated</b> the <b>engines</b> into DRG Class 34.77-78.|$|R
50|$|In 1963, {{as part of}} Saviem's agreements, some JL models <b>incorporated</b> MAN <b>engines,</b> {{changing}} its denomination and forming the new JM range. The ones which preserved the Fulgur engines were renamed as S (S9). The JL denomination was still sporadically used afterwards.|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} approach to predicting {{the performance of}} a boat with waterjets is to simply plot a drag curve against the waterjet’s published thrust-power curves to graphically determine maximum speed. This approach, however, does nothing to expose information about the boat’s performance or whether the particular waterjet model is the best choice for the application. In addition, a proper analysis must <b>incorporate</b> <b>engine</b> RPM into the analysis, as full rated power is not available throughout the RPM range. This case study will illustrate how NavCad can be used to evaluate {{the performance of a}} waterjet-driven vessel, but also to seek out reduction in drag, to quantify the suitability of the waterjet model, and to identify the optimum reduction gear ratio...|$|R
50|$|A modern design, the <b>engine</b> <b>incorporates</b> sensors {{monitoring}} burn conditions. The {{measurements are}} used for telemetry and an emergency protection system.|$|R
50|$|Many farm tractor designs have <b>incorporated</b> their <b>engine</b> block, {{transmission}} case, {{and rear}} axle housing as frame members. Probably {{the first was}} the Fordson tractor, but many others followed. As with many other instances of integration of components into fewer castings, lower unit cost of production was the driver.|$|R

An aircraft is also disclosed...|$|R
50|$|Buell's design <b>incorporated</b> the <b>engine</b> as a fully {{stressed}} {{member of}} the frame. Capping the engineering firsts in this design was Buell's use of a horizontally mounted suspension located beneath the motor utilizing a shock that operated in reverse of the conventional compression-rebound design. Fifty RR1000 models were produced during 1987-1988 before the supply of XR1000 engines was depleted.|$|R
50|$|After {{that the}} factory {{concentrated}} on supplying its engines to other manufacturers, including Brough Superior, Triumph Motorcycles, A. J. Stevens & Co. Ltd, Enfield Cycle Co, Hazlewoods Limited, Zenith Motorcycles, and HRD Motorcycles, {{the forerunner of}} Vincent Motorcycles. Machines that <b>incorporated</b> its <b>engines</b> included the AJS Model D, fabricated for the Russians in the First World War.|$|R
50|$|On February 15, 1957, Van Hool {{signed a}} {{commercial}} agreement with Fiat; Van Hool would <b>incorporate</b> Fiat <b>engines</b> and other mechanical components (gearboxes, axles, steering) in its vehicles. It developed from a coachbuilder to a Belgian manufacturer of integral buses and coaches, known as Van Hool-Fiat. Alongside these activities, the company continued as a coachbuilder, enabling further expansion.|$|R

50|$|The two engines, {{with the}} names Deggendorf und Bayrischer Wald were built by the Deggendorf-Plattling Railway for their branch line and taken over in 1867 by the Ostbahn. On the {{nationalisation}} of the Ostbahn, the Royal Bavarian State Railways initially <b>incorporated</b> the <b>engines</b> into group E, and later into group D as the Class D II.|$|R
50|$|The mid-engine design {{proved to}} have a {{significant}} limitation—the inability to <b>incorporate</b> larger <b>engine</b> sizes, which proved a problem as American drivers were used to having more power; the Dodge/Plymouth/Chrysler models were sold with available V6 engines with slightly more power. At same time, this layout granted the Previa greater interior space than the Chrysler competitors.|$|R
50|$|The {{proprietary}} <b>engine</b> <b>incorporates</b> Blizzard's custom in-house physics, {{a change}} from the original usage of Havok's physics engine, and features destructible environments with an in-game damage effect.|$|R
