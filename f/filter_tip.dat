30|$|The “loop-snare” technique, {{which was}} {{previously}} described by Rubenstein et al. (Rubenstein et al., 2007) for filters that are tilted against the IVC wall, enables the operator {{to remove the}} tip from the caval wall and consequently retrieve the IVC filter. The concept is as followed: a reverse curve catheter is positioned below the <b>filter</b> <b>tip</b> and used to direct a guidewire backwards in a “U-turn” fashion. The wire is then snared above the filter thereby creating a loop around the <b>filter</b> <b>tip.</b> The sheath is then advanced towards {{the tip of the}} filter and traction is applied to both ends of the wire to pull the <b>filter</b> <b>tip</b> away from the vessel wall into the sheath.|$|E
30|$|During a CT for macrohematuria {{more than}} 8 [*]years later a severe tilt of the filter was seen with two legs around the aorta and one leg eroding the bone of a {{vertebral}} body. In a multidisciplinary board {{the decision for}} another retrieval attempt was made. 3146 [*]days after implantation the patient was scheduled for a second attempt. Expecting a difficult retrieval an 18 -F sheath (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana, USA) was inserted into the right jugular vein. Venography confirmed a tilted filter with the tip deeply embedded into the IVC wall and two legs protruding outside the IVC (Fig. 1 b). Two loops were formed around the <b>filter</b> <b>tip</b> using the same instruments previously described: two reversed shape SOS-catheters (Omni 2, 5 F, 80 [*]cm, Angiodynamics, New York, USA) were placed below the filter and two exchange length Bentson wires (260 [*]cm, Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana, USA) were navigated {{on both sides of}} the <b>filter</b> <b>tip.</b> Above the tip the wires were snared. A second view confirmed one loop on each side of the <b>filter</b> <b>tip</b> (Fig. 1 c). During traction both loops started to slip away from the tip, therefore a third loop was created (Fig. 1 d) again using a Bentson wire. With 3 loops around the <b>filter</b> <b>tip,</b> the filter could be removed from the wall and finally pulled into the 18 F sheath. Configuration of the 3 loops around different filter struts was documented after retrieval (Fig. 1 e). During final traction the patient expressed stinging pain in the back. Post-interventional venography showed a large contrast pocket was visible at the location of the embedded <b>filter</b> <b>tip</b> (Fig. 1 f) without a true extravasation. An immediate CT did not show extravasation or retroperitoneal hematoma. Because the patient was hemodynamically stable no further treatment was undertaken.|$|E
30|$|We {{describe}} a multi-loop-snare technique which was applied twice successfully after a failed attempt with one loop. Instead of one loop, two respectively three loops were created around the <b>filter</b> <b>tip</b> for successful removal. Both cases were performed under local anesthesia.|$|E

According to The Federal Government's National Cancer Institute (NCI), light cigarettes provide no benefit to smokers' health.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, the multi-loop-snare {{technique}} is a refined {{version of the}} single loop-snare technique for difficult IVC filter retrievals. The multiple-loop-snare technique allows a better alignment of the <b>filter</b> <b>tip</b> leading to a better control and traction during retrieval. It seems that adding loops can further increase the success rate of retrievals.|$|E
30|$|After 5 [*]weeks of Warfarin therapy {{the patient}} was {{scheduled}} for retrieval which was considered mandatory due to the displaced and tilted filter with penetrating legs. After introduction of a 14 -F sheath (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana, USA), a SOS catheter (Omni 2, 5 F, 80 [*]cm, Angiodynamics, New York, USA) together with a Bentson wire (260 [*]cm, Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana, USA) and EN Snare (7 F, 18 – 30 [*]mm, Merit Medical, Utah, USA) were {{used to create a}} loop. The single loop-snare technique was attempted several times without success because the loop kept slipping around the filter legs. In order to stabilize the loop a second loop using the same technique was formed around the <b>filter</b> <b>tip.</b> Withtwo loops around the <b>filter</b> <b>tip,</b> the filter was successfully pulled away from the wall and into the 14 F sheath.|$|E
40|$|A novel porous {{polyurethane}} (PU) hybrid foam {{was designed}} to improve the hydrophilicity of a conventional open pore PU foam, and to enhance the adsorption of carcinogenic compounds from tobacco smoke. The hybrid foam was prepared by interdispersing ultramilled alumina particles within PU precursors to realize a PU/Al 2 O 3 hybrid porous material with well controlled microstructural properties and improved hydrophilicity. The capability of the as obtained hybrid foam to adsorb toxic compounds from the mainstream of tobacco smoke was investigated by using a cellulose-active carbon-cellulose triple filter model, {{and the results were}} compared to those obtained for neat PU foam and the standard cigarette <b>filter</b> <b>tip.</b> The results of this study showed that the ultramilled alumina particles enhanced both thermal stability and hydrophilicity of the neat PU foam. Furthermore, the as-obtained hybrid PU/Al 2 O 3 foam was able to improve the adsorption of nitrosamines, acetamide, idroquinone, cresol and small aminic and aldehydic molecules, if compared to neat PU foam and standard cigarette <b>filter</b> <b>tip,</b> evidencing potential as tobacco smoke filter...|$|E

30|$|We {{present an}} {{improved}} loop-snare technique which allows to retrieve IVC filters when the simple loop-snare technique fails. We used additional loops, {{in one case}} one additional loop in another case two additional loops around the <b>filter</b> <b>tip</b> which allowed successful retrieval. The additional loops were created with a reversed shaped catheter. All guidewires were then engaged with a snare and pulled into a large sheath. The additional loops stabilize the tip and the filter can be pulled into the sheath.|$|E
30|$|Retrieval of tilted and/or {{embedded}} IVC filters {{can be very}} difficult. The goal is {{to extract}} the filter with minimal risk for complications (e.g. dissection, rupture, thrombosis, filter breakdown etc.) The simple “loop-snare” technique has been described previously and has {{a high rate of}} success. Sometimes however, one loop may slip around the <b>filter</b> <b>tip</b> preventing a retrieval. In such cases a second or third loop can help stabilize the filter enabling the operator to pull the filter away from the wall and into a large sheath. It is important to use different fulcrums to create a more stable situation.|$|E

25|$|The PCR {{method is}} {{extremely}} sensitive, requiring {{only a few}} DNA molecules in a single reaction for amplification across several orders of magnitude. Therefore, adequate measures to avoid contamination from any DNA present in the lab environment (bacteria, viruses, or human sources) are required. Because products from previous PCR amplifications are a common source of contamination, many molecular biology labs have implemented procedures that involve dividing the lab into separate areas. One lab area is dedicated to preparation and handling of pre-PCR reagents and the setup of the PCR reaction, and another area to post-PCR processing, such as gel electrophoresis or PCR product purification. For the setup of PCR reactions, many standard operating procedures involve using pipettes with <b>filter</b> <b>tips</b> and wearing fresh laboratory gloves, {{and in some cases}} a laminar flow cabinet with UV lamp as a work station (to destroy any extraneomultimer formation). PCR is routinely assessed against a negative control reaction that is set up identically to the experimental PCR, but without template DNA, and performed alongside the experimental PCR.|$|R

30|$|Smokers’ MLE was {{estimated}} by a previously described filter analysis methodology (St Charles et al. 2009). In brief, smoke toxicant yields among smokers were {{estimated by the}} relationship between the amount of tar and nicotine retained within the filter and the amount passing through the filter to the smoker, as defined by calibration smoking using a smoking machine. Calibrations were established by machine smoking each product over a wide range of typical human smoking behaviour parameters (e.g. puff volumes, durations and flows). Each smoker’s spent filters collected in the filter cutters were split randomly into three groups of five tips, which were analysed independently on different days. The length of each <b>filter</b> <b>tip</b> was measured (± 0.1  mm), and recorded before being extracted in methanol (containing n-heptadecane as an internal standard). The extracts were analysed for both tip nicotine using gas chromatography and tar using UV absorbance with a variable wavelength detector set at 310  nm as described previously (St Charles et al. 2009).|$|E

The affinity and the binding properties of the imprinted polymer towards nicotine were investigated by equilibrium rebinding experiments. The results indicated the presence of nicotine-specific binding sites in the imprinted polymer, and that the imprinted polymer had a good capacity (90 mumol/g polymer) for nicotine. The elution conditions were optimized on the column packed with the imprinted polymer to elute nicotine quantitatively.

40|$|Abstract: In this study, the {{tracheal}} {{tissues of}} rats inhaling cigarette smoke passively during different periods were examined by light and electron microscopy. Malonaldehyde, erythrocyte catalase and arginase levels were also measured. Three groups were formed {{and a total}} of 15 Wistar male rats weighing 200 - 250 g were used. Rats assigned to the first and second groups were made to inhale cigarette smoke for 30 and 60 minutes respectively for a total of 3 months. The subjects in the third group were made to inhale clean air as a control. Cigarettes without <b>filter</b> <b>tips</b> were used througout the study. Lit cigarettes were inserted into the chamber. At {{the end of the study}} period, blood and tissue samples were taken. The results revealed that the subjects which inhaled cigarette smoke for a longer period were affected more. Irregularities in epithelial cells, increase in secretion, and increases in mast cells in connective tissues, especially those which had migrated through the epithelial cells, were observed. The considerable increase in the separations between epithelial cells is of particular note. Malonaldehyde levels in tissues were lower than in the control group, but higher in plasma.

Indeed, many seeds of Brassica sp. pl.

Archeobotanical seeds were identified (Brassica cf. juncea, B. napus, B. nigra, B. cf. oleracea, B. rapa) and then analyzed {{to find any}} traces of aDNA (by Simona De Felice during PhD of Aberystwyth University, UK) using several precautionary measures to prevent exogenous contamination: a) seeds with unbroken integument were treated with UV light to break and immobilize any contaminant DNA present on seed coat surface; b) DNA extractions were made on internal seed tissues that had been isolated from their surrounding seed coat under a sterile dissecting microscope; c) DNA extractions and PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) were performed under sterile conditions (sterilized laminar flow hood), using pipettes with <b>filter</b> <b>tips</b> and in a different building from that where modern Brassica samples were routinely analysed.

40|$|By {{the late}} 1970 s, eight {{technologies}} {{in the design}} of a ‘less hazardous’ cigarette were classified as significant. The eight included: The tobacco blend, the <b>filter</b> <b>tip,</b> filter-tip additives, reconstituted tobacco sheet, paper additives, air dilution via paper porosity, expanded tobacco, and air dilution via filter-tip perforation. In addition to these eight cigarette-design technologies was another proposed technology which involved the incorporation of a substitute for {{some or all of the}} tobacco in the cigarette filler. Despite considerable research and development (R&D) effort on various tobacco substitutes that indicated the replacements in most instances fulfilled the definition of a ‘less hazardous’ cigarette with regard to the chemical and biological properties of their mainstream smoke, tobacco substitute-containing cigarettes failed to attain consumer acceptability. As a result, several marketed products containing tobacco substitutes had an extremely brief tenure in the marketplace. Outlined herein is a summary of some detailed research conducted on the composition of the mainstream smokes from cigarettes containing either all-substitute filler or fillers comprising various substitute and tobacco mixtures as well as an all-tobacco cigarette...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} for rapidly screening and quantitatively analyzing organic molecules is presented, {{in which a}} miniaturized solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge containing 0. 6 mg of graphitized carbon black (the GCB-mu-trap) is used for sample pretreatment. Then surface-assisted laser desorption ionization dine-of-flight mass spectrometry (SALDI-TOF-MS) screening is followed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) for robust quantitative analysis of samples containing analytes of interest. Liquid samples with volumes up to 100 mL were extracted using the GCB-mu-trap, and SALDI screening was performed by transferring a few particles of the GCB 4 sorbent from the mu-trap onto a stainless steel plate. Analytes were then simply ionized and desorbed by irradiating the GCB 4 particles without any further pretreatment. GCB 4 {{was found to be}} an excellent surface for the SALDI analysis of small molecules, providing spectra with very clean backgrounds. The small size of the cartridge (micropipet <b>filter</b> <b>tip)</b> results in enrichment of the analytes on a small surface area, affording low SALDI-TOF-MS detection limits. Furthermore, the removal of just a few particles from the p-trap does not significantly affect the subsequent quantitative determination.

40|$|Effects of {{mechanical}} compression of the filter tips and of blocking the air channels {{of a special}} filter design on the smoke yields of seven brands of commercial filter cigarettes were investigated. In addition, the influence of these variables on actual uptake of smoke constituents by smokers was studied with four subjects. Compression of filter tips produced major increases in smoke yields for the cigarette which features a <b>filter</b> <b>tip</b> with four longitudinal air channels at its periphery. Blocking of these air channels increased tar yields by 51 per cent, nicotine by 69 per cent, and carbon monoxide by 147 per cent. Subjects who smoked the cigarette with this special filter design tended to smoke fewer cigarettes per day than when they smoked cigarettes with perforated filter tips, yet their plasma cotinine levels were significantly higher. Blood pressure and pulse rate were markedly elevated after first exposure to smoke from the special filter cigarette, as were plasma nicotine levels. These results point out that individuals inhale different quantities of smoke constituents from cigarettes with reportedly similar smoke yields according to Federal Trade Commission methods. A redefinition of "average" smoking parameters readjustment of standard laboratory methodology are suggested...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{reduce the}} {{possibility}} of cigarette appearance misleading consumers about harm caused by the product, the European Commission’s draft Tobacco Products Directive proposed banning cigarettes < 7. 5 mm in diameter. It appears however, following a plenary vote in the European Parliament, that {{this will not be}} part of the final Tobacco Products Directive. To reduce the appeal of cigarettes, the Australian Government banned the use of branding on cigarettes and stipulated a maximum cigarette length as part of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act. We explored the role, if any, of cigarette appearance on perceptions of appeal and harm among adolescents. Methods: Focus group research with 15 -year-olds (N = 48) was conducted in Glasgow (Scotland) to explore young people’s perceptions of eight cigarettes differing in length, diameter, colour and decorative design. Results: Slim and superslim cigarettes with white <b>filter</b> <b>tips</b> and decorative features were viewed most favourably and rated most attractive across gender and socio-economic groups. The slimmer diameters of these cigarettes communicated weaker tasting and less harmful looking cigarettes. This was closely linked to appeal as thinness implied a more pleasant and palatable smoke for young smokers. A long brown cigarette was viewed as particularly unattractive and communicated a stronger and more harmful product. Conclusion: This exploratory study provides some support that standardising cigarette appearance could reduce the appeal of cigarettes in adolescents and reduce the opportunity for stick design to mislead young smokers in terms of harm...|$|R
