The extended overview is accompanied by the original and unique analysis of the business model of The First Club Insurance Carrier, the only Czech peer-to-peer insurance company. The suitability of the concept developed by The First Club Insurance Carrier is tested using five different scenarios derived from its competitors on the Czech insurance market.

This thesis offers also some requirements for more favorable outcomes (such as a better distribution of <b>gross</b> <b>earned</b> <b>premium</b> between reinsurance and claims expenses).
