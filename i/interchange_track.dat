5|$|Lewis died in 1893, and in {{the next}} decade the DL built no new lines. However, a group of investors bought the company, {{including}} the Dayton terminal property, in 1901 for $250,000 from Lewis's heirs. The first segment of the line into downtown Dayton was completed in late 1902, branching off the main line at Hempstead and ending at Lambeth, site of the Dayton State Hospital. Unable to obtain a franchise from Dayton, and still unprofitable, the DL entered receivership in January 1905, and was sold at foreclosure in April 1907 and reorganized in May as the Dayton, Lebanon and Cincinnati Railroad and Terminal Company. The bondholders who had organized the new company succeeded in obtaining the franchise, and sold the stock to a new group of investors in January 1909. Construction was restarted in April, and in November the branch reached the intersection of Brown and Caldwell Streets and the National Cash Register plant. Finally, after completing the cuts and fills required along the east bank of the Great Miami River, the DL opened its new main line in 1912, to a passenger depot {{on the north side of}} Washington Street, several blocks south and west of the city's main Union Station. A freight depot was located just to the north, at Eaker Street, and just beyond was an <b>interchange</b> <b>track</b> (not part of the original line) connecting to the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway (B system) and, via that line, the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Panhandle Route, part of the Pennsylvania system).|$|E

2500|$|The {{subway system}} (lines 1, 2 and 4) is built {{to the unique}} gauge of [...] {{which is the same}} gauge used on the Toronto {{streetcar}} system. This gauge is [...] wider than the usual [...] Some early subway proposals involved using streetcars at least partially in tunnels, so using same gauge would be advantageous, but the idea was ultimately dropped in favour of dedicated rapid-transit trains. A number of ex-streetcar vehicles were used as work trains for the subway, taking advantage of the common gauge. Indeed, before the opening of the Yonge subway in 1954, there was a temporary <b>interchange</b> <b>track</b> between the Yonge streetcar line and the Davisville Yard {{on the north side of}} the Belt Line bridge. However, according to rail historians John F. Bromley and Jack May, the reason that the Yonge subway was built to the streetcar gauge, was that between 1954 and 1965, subway bogies were maintained at the Hillcrest Complex where the streetcar gauge is used for shop tracks. The Davisville Carhouse was not equipped to perform such heavy maintenance, and the bogies would be loaded onto a specially built track trailer for shipment between Davisville and Hillcrest.|$|E

50|$|Before {{the city}} of Rochelle built the park, railfans {{typically}} parked just short of an interchange siding connecting the two railroads in the northern quadrant of the crossing. The <b>interchange</b> <b>track</b> connected the northern track of the eastern portion of the UP's mainline with the northern track of the western portion of the BNSF's mainline. While this parking location allowed the railfans to see a great distance towards the West along UP's mainline, many vehicles were parked {{too close to the}} <b>interchange</b> <b>track</b> to be safe if a train were to use the interchange. Additionally, there was no protection to keep trespassers off the tracks themselves. This Northern <b>interchange</b> <b>track</b> has since been removed although a longer interchange siding still exists on the South quadrant of the crossing.|$|E
50|$|The {{railroad}} {{was unique}} for {{being one of}} the few trolley railroads in the country to have a primary function of hauling freight cars.

The JW&NW tower and {{dispatcher}} were at this junction. PRR and JW&NW control and signaling to prevent collisions (called interlocking) was the responsibility of the JW&NW tower. Dispatching orders for the conductors of the interurban cars was by written order, and the interurbans stopped here to pick them up. Passenger and freight business for the line was at its greatest in the 1920s.|$|R

50|$|Service between Ithaca and South Lansing, was {{operated}} with streetcars leased {{from the}} Ithaca Street Ry. An <b>interchange</b> <b>track</b> with the Lehigh Valley was laid at Remington, {{near the base}} of the hill, but the steep grade and limited tractive capacity of the streetcars meant that business was minimal. Service from South Lansing to Auburn was steam-operated. In 1909, a 0.5-mile branch was built by Col. J.V. McIntyre, owner of the Rogues' Harbor Inn, from his establishment to South Lansing. This was also electrified, and regular service from Ithaca to Rogues' Harbor Inn was established.|$|E

50|$|The {{interchange}} of {{cars with}} the national rail system occurs only at the Lee Hall junction where interchange tracks exist linking the FEMRR to (originally) the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) (now CSX). FEMRR engines and cars were not permitted on C&O tracks beyond the Yorktown Road grade crossing except in emergencies. Cars outbound from Fort Eustis would be spotted on a designated <b>interchange</b> <b>track</b> (other than passing track #493, which was a dedicated runaround track) and deemed delivered to the C&O when the bills of lading and switch lists were signed by the C&O station agent. Inbound cars would be spotted on the <b>interchange</b> <b>track</b> by the C&O and deemed delivered to the Government when uncoupled from the engine (or {{the rest of the}} train) that brought them there. FEMRR engines and trains were not allowed on the C&O main line except in emergencies. However, with proper prior arrangement, C&O trains or light engines (engines under power but not coupled to cars or dead engines) were allowed to operate on FEMRR tracks on the Industrial Subdivision (save the Port Branch), the Wye Tower Interlocking Plant, and the part of the James River Subdivision between O’Brien, the wye and Hanks, including Hanks Yard. The Commanding Officer, Company A, 714th TBROS&DE had to approve the use of any other tracks by the C&O. All C&O trains and light engines were to be provided a pilot and any necessary highway crossing protection.|$|E

50|$|On May 17, 1990, the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway (1990) began {{operations}} {{over several}} hundred miles of secondary routes across Ohio previously owned by Norfolk Southern. This included the original Wheeling and Lake Erie Cleveland Line to Canton. Primary commodities shipped included coke and scrap metal. The Wheeling typically ran two turns into Cleveland each weekday. In 2001, citing economic downturn, LTV Steel decided to idle their Cleveland steel mills, which hurt {{business for the}} Wheeling, whose primary customer in Cleveland proper was the steel industry. In early 2002, the Wheeling embargoed the Cleveland Line from CP Harvard to the terminus at Campbell Yard. This line was shut down due {{to a combination of}} little traffic, increased wait times at the CP Harvard crossing with the NS (former Conrail) Cleveland Line, and subsequent vandalization of stopped trains at the Harvard crossing. The remaining Wheeling line was truncated into an <b>interchange</b> <b>track</b> with the NS Randall Secondary.|$|E
5000|$|Davisville Yard {{acted as}} the main {{maintenance}} and storage yard for Toronto's Yonge subway, which opened between Union Station and Eglinton Avenue in 1954. The first two subway cars (5000 and 5001) were delivered to the TTC's Hillcrest Complex, but subsequent subway cars were delivered to Davisville yard via the Toronto Belt Line Railway. Before {{the opening of the}} subway, there was a temporary <b>interchange</b> <b>track</b> between the Yonge streetcar line and the Davisville Yard {{on the north side of}} the Belt Line bridge for the interchange of rail equipment with the streetcar system. In 1953, subway cars 5000 and 5001, after being displayed at the Canadian National Exhibition, were mounted on shop bogies and towed at night over streetcar tracks by a Peter Witt motor to the Davisville Yard via the temporary interchange.

An east-west branch [...] "Ayalon East", from Highway 4 to the Tel Aviv University railway station along the path of the Yarkon River has been planned, but is still not approved. Currently the northern terminus of the road is in Herzliya, but is expected to be extended further north to near kibbutz Shefayim, where it will have another connection to Highway 2 by 2018 as part of the Route 531 construction project.|$|R
500|$|Phase II entailed {{completion}} of the Second Avenue Subway. The line would go south from 34th Street to the Financial District, going along Second Avenue, Bowery, and Water Street until it reached Whitehall Street at South Ferry. At Grand Street of the Chrystie Street Connection, which had just opened in 1967, the station would be widened to provide cross-platform interchange between Second and Sixth Avenue trains. There was also the possibility of <b>track</b> <b>interchanges,</b> allowing SAS service to go across the Manhattan Bridge to Coney Island. There would also be lines of a new people mover system, called the [...] "Central Business District distribution system", installed under 57th, 48th, 42nd, and 33rd Streets to link transit stations, offices, and attractions in the Midtown CBD.
