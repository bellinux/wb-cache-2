A. A. Gill for The Times recommended that people should [...] "eat here at least once to find out what is really <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> mouth". Also in 2005, German food critic Wolfram Siebeck visited the restaurant complained of the delays in service and of several of the dishes, described the mustard ice cream in a red cabbage gazpacho soup as a [...] "fart of nothingness", while chef Nico Ladenis said of the restaurant, [...] "Someone who makes egg and bacon ice cream is hailed a genius. If you vomit and make ice cream out of it, are you a star?" [...] Tony Naylor of The Guardian enjoyed his trip to the restaurant in 2008, and afterwards criticised those who thought that spending £323.13 on a meal for two at lunchtime was too much.|$|E
2500|$|Although Norwood {{received}} a sole writing credit on album cut [...] "Finally" [...] only, she noted Afrodisiac the most honest effort {{of her career}} yet based on its deeply autobiographical content, commenting: [...] "Everything I do {{has something to do}} with what I've gone through in my life [...] I definitely wanted to incorporate that in my art. It makes it more real when you add what's been <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life in your music. I've grown and I've gone through some things in my life, and I celebrate that, I honor that." [...] Soundwise, her collaboration with Timbaland, recent motherhood, life experiences, and growing affinity toward alternative music such as Coldplay, caused Norwood to shift toward a more matured outlook and raw nature with the album, a venture into the organic sounds of soul blues, ambient music, and the nostalgic street-wise sound of 1990’s hip-hop.|$|E

40|$|CPTED 101 {{applies to}} both new and {{existing}} schools and {{is built on}} three simple concepts: natural surveillance, natural access control, and territoriality. If your school layout seems unsafe, adopting a few CPTED fundamentals may help make it significantly safer. 1 Natural surveillance is the physical ability to see what’s <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> and around <b>your</b> school. Solid walls, tall shrubs, parked cars, outbuildings, sculptures, large signs, and other obstacles can block natural surveillance. If there are locations on your campus where problems often occur, are they hidden from view? If so, {{look for ways to}} increase visibility. Some common approaches include: � Installing openings or windows in solid walls, to increase visual exposure. � Replacing solid walls with wrought iron fencing. � Blocking access to the hidden area entirely. � Removing any welcoming features, such as benches, that draw people into the hidden area. If these relatively “natural ” arrangements don’t do the job, install convex mirrors to provide visibility around corners, consider electronic surveillance equipment, or increase patrols. The concept of natural surveillance suggests that the more lighting, the better. Paradoxically, it doesn’t always work that way. Sometimes good lighting attracts misbehavior, while darkness drives people away. Many schools have gone to darkened campuses for this reason. School resource officers have found that good lighting made schools ideal hangouts after hours, whil...|$|R

6000|$|Yes, my friends. These {{are very}} terrible {{thoughts}}--very wrong thoughts some of them, very foolish thoughts some of them, though pardonable enough; for God pardons them, {{as we shall}} see. But they are real thoughts. They are what really come into people's minds every day; and I am here {{to talk to you}} about what is really <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> soul, and mine; not to repeat to you doctrines at second-hand out of a book, and say, There, that is what you have to believe and do; and, if you do not, you will go to hell: but to speak to you as men of like passions with myself; as sinning, sorrowing, doubting, struggling human beings; and to talk to you of what is in my own heart, and will be in your hearts too, some day, if it has not been already. This is the experience of all REAL men, all honest men, who ever struggled to know and to do what is right. David felt it all. You find it all through those glorious Psalms of his. He was no comfortable, book-read, second-hand Christian, who had an answer ready for every trouble, because he had never had any real trouble at all. David was not one of them. He had to go through a very rough training--very terrible and fiery trials, year after year; and had to say, again and again, 'I am weary of crying; my heart is dry; my heart faileth me for waiting so long upon my God. All thy billows and storms are gone over me. Thou hast laid me in a place of darkness, and in the lowest deep.' - ...|$|E
6000|$|And now, my friends, I {{will tell}} you what will happen to you. You see that I know something, without having been told of what has been <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> hearts. I beseech you, believe me when I tell you what will go on in them. God will chastise you for your sins. He will; just because He loves you, and does not hate you; just because you are His children, and not dumb animals born to perish. Troubles will come upon you as you grow older. Of what sort they will be I cannot tell; but that they will come, I can tell full well. And when the Lord sends trouble to you, shall it harden your hearts or soften them? It depends on you, {{altogether}} on you, whether the Lord hardens your hearts by sending those sorrows, or whether He softens and turns them and brings them back to the only right place for them--home to Him. But your trouble may only harden your heart all the more. The sorrows and sore judgments which the Lord sent Pharaoh only hardened his heart. It all depends upon the way in which you take these troubles, my friends. And that not so much when they come as after they come. Almost all, let their hearts be right with God or not, seem to take sorrow as they ought, while the sorrow is on them. Pharaoh did so too. He said to Moses and Aaron: [...] "I have sinned this time. The Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. Entreat the Lord that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go." [...] What could be more right or better spoken? Was not Pharaoh in a proper state of mind then? Was not his heart humbled, and his will resigned to God? Moses thought not. For while he promised Pharaoh to pray that the storm might pass over, yet he warned him: [...] "But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the Lord your God." [...] And so it happened; for, [...] "when Pharaoh saw that the rain, and hail, and thunder had ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. Neither would he let the children of Israel go." [...] . And so, alas! it happens to many a man and woman nowadays. They find themselves on a sick-bed. They are in fear of death, in fear of poverty, in fear of shame and punishment for their misdeeds. And then they say: [...] "It is God's judgment. I have been very wicked. I know God is punishing me. Oh, if God will but raise me up off this sick-bed; if He will but help me out of this trouble, I will give up all my wicked ways. I will repent and amend." [...] So said Pharaoh; and yet, {{as soon as he was}} safe out of his distress, he hardened his heart. And so does many a man and woman, who, when they get safe through their troubles, never give up one of their sins, any more than Pharaoh did. They really believe that God has punished them. They really intend to amend, while they are in the trouble: but as soon as they are out of it, they try to persuade themselves that it was not God who sent the sorrow, that it came [...] "by accident," [...] or that [...] "people must have trouble in this life," [...] or that [...] "if they had taken better care, they might have prevented it."--All of them excuses to themselves for forgetting God in the matter, and, therefore, for forgetting what they promised to God in trouble; and so, after all, they go on just as they went on before. And yet not as they went on before. For every such sin hardens their hearts; every such sin makes them less able to see God's hand in what happens to them; every such sin makes them more bold and confident in disobeying God, and saying to themselves: [...] "After all, why should I be so frightened when I am in trouble, and make such promises to amend my life? For the trouble goes away, whether I mend my life or not; and nothing happens to me; God does not punish me for not keeping my promises to Him. I may as well go on in my own way, for I seem not the worse off in body or in purse for so doing." [...] Thus do people harden their hearts after each trouble, as Pharaoh did; so that you will see people, by one affliction after another, one loss after another, all their lives through, warned by God that sin will not prosper them; and confessing that their sins have brought God's punishment on them: and yet going on steadily in the very sins which have brought on their troubles, and gaining besides, as time runs on, a heart more and more hardened. And why? ...|$|E
