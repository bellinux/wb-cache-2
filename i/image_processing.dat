This thesis will study about the accuracy assessment in height coordinates using UAV <b>images</b> <b>processing</b> based on orthometric height observation data. Apart from that, the accuracy of height coordinates using UAV <b>images</b> <b>processing</b> based on different number of ground control point (GCP) are also assess. In this study, Agisoft PhotoScan v 0. 9. 0 and Global Mapper v 15. 2. 3 are the software used for the processing and analysis. Ground control points and check points were established using Real Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) and leveling method. There are two photogrammetric products produced in this study such as orthophoto and digital elevation model (DEM). The analyses of the photogrammetric products were performed based on different number of GCP and different orthometric height observation data. The {{results of this study}} showed that the height accuracy of photogrammetric products using UAV <b>images</b> <b>processing</b> based on 10 GCPs produced better accuracy than 5 GCPs. RMSE values of check point height coordinates based on data from leveling method are ± 0. 161 meter for 5 GCPs and ± 0. 116 meter for 10 GCPs while RMSE values of check point height coordinates based on data from RTK-GPS method are ± 0. 167 meter for 5 GCPs and ± 0. 124 meter for 10 GCPs. The results also showed that photogrammetric products using UAV <b>images</b> <b>processing</b> based on leveling method provide more accurate height results than RTK-GPS method. The RMSE value of check point height coordinates based on RTK-GPS method is ± 0. 148 meter (10 GCPs) and RMSE value of check point height coordinates based on leveling method is ± 0. 116 meter (10 GCPs). As conclusion, UAV images can be used to generate DEM that give height coordinate values with sub-meter accuracy...|$|R

25|$|Colour apodization is a {{technique}} combining a modified lens design with <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> to achieve an increased depth of field. The lens is modified such that each colour channel has a different lens aperture. For example, the red channel may be f/2.4, green may be f/2.4, whilst the blue channel may be f/5.6. Therefore, the blue channel will have a greater depth of field than the other colours. The <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> identifies blurred regions in the red and green channels and in these regions copies the sharper edge data from the blue channel. The result is an image that combines the best features from the different f-numbers, (Kay 2011).|$|E
