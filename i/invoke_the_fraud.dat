Few recognise him as a [...] "reformist", but his recommendations as the Chair of the KANU Review Committee, popularly known as the [...] "Saitoti Committee" [...] in 1990-91, opened KANU to internal changes {{and set the stage}} for the repeal of Section 2A and Kenya's return to pluralist democracy. Saitoti left KANU and joined the opposition, becoming a kingpin figure in the negotiations that led to the [...] "NARC Revolution" [...] in 2002. As Minister for Internal Security and Provincial Administration, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and key member of the National Security Advisory Committee (NSAC), he later worked closely with the national Ministry of Defence to see through the Operation Linda Nchi against the Al-Shabaab insurgent group. In addition, rival factions had for decades <b>invoked</b> <b>the</b> infamous Goldenberg <b>fraud</b> to knock Saitoti out of politics, but the legal courts cleared him of the scandal in July 2006. Saitoti's dual heritage as a Maasai with Kikuyu family members predisposed him to a pan-Kenyan vision, but also denied him a strong ethnic base unlike his competitors. As one of Kenya's most experienced, unassuming and shrewd politicians, Saitoti was billed as a front-runner in the race to succeed President Mwai Kibaki.|$|R

50|$|In a {{unanimous}} decision, Chief Justice John Roberts ruled {{against the federal}} government's argument that the discovery rule determined {{the statute of limitations}} for filing <b>the</b> <b>fraud</b> lawsuit.

Government regulatory agencies are subject to the standard rule, which initiates the standard of limitations upon the perpetration of <b>the</b> <b>fraud.</b> Under this earlier threshold, the SEC missed the five-year deadline to file suit against Gabelli.
