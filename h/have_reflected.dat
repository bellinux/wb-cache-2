5|$|In the Decembers of 1916 and 1917, German overtures to the British for truces were {{recorded}} without any success. In some French sectors, singing and {{an exchange of}} thrown gifts was occasionally recorded, though these may simply <b>have</b> <b>reflected</b> a seasonal extension of the live-and-let-live approach common in the trenches.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{decision}} by John, the war with Russia ended in 1583 when the Tsar concluded the Truce of Plussa (Plyussa, Pljussa, Plusa) with Sweden. Russia relinquished most of Ingria but left Narva and Ivangorod under Swedish control. Originally scheduled to last three years, the Russo-Swedish truce was later extended until 1590. During the negotiations, Sweden made vast demands for Russian territory, including Novgorod. Whilst these conditions were probably only {{for the purposes of}} negotiation, they may <b>have</b> <b>reflected</b> Swedish aspirations of territory in the region.|$|E
5|$|No coins {{were issued}} {{with the name}} of Æthelred or Æthelflæd on them, but in the 910s silver pennies were minted in west Mercian towns with unusual {{ornamental}} designs on the reverse and this may <b>have</b> <b>reflected</b> Æthelflæd's desire to distinguish specie issued under her control from that of her brother. After her death, west Mercian coin reverses were again the same as those on coins produced in Wessex.|$|E

5|$|Since then, interpretations in {{successive}} eras <b>have</b> <b>reflected</b> the {{sensibilities of}} the time. Goya {{was seen as}} a proto-Romantic in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on Théodore Géricault, best known for the politically charged Raft of the Medusa (1818–19). Luis Buñuel identified with Goya's sense of the absurd, and referenced his works in such films as the 1930 L'Âge d'Or, on which he collaborated with Salvador Dalí, and his 1962 The Exterminating Angel.|$|E
5|$|The {{architectural}} {{designs of}} these projects <b>have</b> <b>reflected</b> not only the style currents of their time, but the societal debate over the purpose they were intended to serve. Nationalistic ambitions early on gave way to austere designs based on functionalism, and then to designs that emphasized human and ecological needs. To a great extent, Norwegian architects have found {{the opportunity to develop}} their signature styles through these projects, and thereby also a Norwegian architectural dialect.|$|E
5|$|These {{thoughts}} are employed on various important situations and {{incidents in the}} ordinary life of females, and are, in general, dictated with great judgment.

We should therefore recommend these Thoughts as worthy the attention {{of those who are}} more immediately concerned in the education of young ladies.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Perseus at Pydna in 168BC, the Roman Senate allowed the reopening of iron and copper mines, but forbade the mining of gold and silver by the four newly {{established}} autonomous client states that replaced the monarchy in Macedonia. The law may originally have been conceived by the Senate due to the fear that material wealth gained from gold and silver mining operations would allow the Macedonians to fund an armed rebellion. The Romans were perhaps also concerned with stemming inflation caused by an increased money supply from Macedonian silver mining. The Macedonians continued minting silver coins between 167 and 148BC (i.e. just before {{the establishment of the}} Roman province of Macedonia), and when the Romans lifted the ban on Macedonian silver mining in 158BC it may simply <b>have</b> <b>reflected</b> the local reality of this illicit practice continuing regardless of the Senate's decree.|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Lincoln was a {{religious}} skeptic, or, {{in the words}} of a biographer, an iconoclast. Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might <b>have</b> <b>reflected</b> his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} the Aksumite coins were also closely controlled, usually of high purity. For example, the lowest purity of gold {{recorded}} thus far for Aphilas is 90 percent. Early issues were often very close to their theoretical weights, and some were even over.) However, {{the weight of the}} coins tended to decrease over time (though not continuously or uniformly). This may <b>have</b> <b>reflected</b> a desire to conform to the Diocletian monetary reform of 301, when the aureus was decreased from 1/60 of a pound to 1/72. Despite decreases in weight, the purity of the gold was largely maintained, even by later kings. The relative abundance of Aksumite coins as well as the many that have yet to be found indicate that Aksum must have had access to large quantities of gold.|$|E

5|$|The {{tradition}} of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent {{for much of}} the sixteenth century. In his majority James V was probably more concerned with architectural expressions of royal identity. Mary Queen of Scots had been brought up in the French court, where she was drawn and painted by major European artists, but she did not commission any adult portraits, {{with the exception of the}} joint portrait with her second husband Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. This may <b>have</b> <b>reflected</b> an historic Scottish pattern, where heraldic display, or an elaborate tomb were considered more important than a portrait.|$|E
5|$|Hieronymus, in 2009, {{concluded}} that the nasal and supraorbital bosses were used for butting or ramming the head or the flank of a rival. The bone structure indicates that the bosses were covered by cornified pads as in modern muskoxen, suggesting dominance fights {{similar to those of}} members of the Caprinae subfamily. In the latter group, an evolutionary transition can be observed, where the originally straight horns become more robust, padded, and increasingly curved downwards. The evolution from horncores into bosses in Centrosaurinae would likewise <b>have</b> <b>reflected</b> a change in fighting technique, from clashing to high-energy head-butting. Head-butting would have been an expensive and risky behavior. Opponents would only have engaged this way after assessing each other's strengths visually. For this reason, Hieronymus considered it unlikely that the bosses served for species recognition as this was already guaranteed by the innate species-specific display rituals preceding a real – instead of a ritual – fight. The bosses would have evolved for actual combat, part of a social selection in which individuals competed for scarce resources such as mates, food and breeding grounds.|$|E
5|$|Some {{incidents}} in Fingleton's {{century in the}} last match of the season were also believed to <b>have</b> <b>reflected</b> badly at the selection table. Having retired hurt on 78, he returned {{the next day and}} was then dropped on 86 in the slips. Fingleton had moved out of his crease to pat out the pitch before the ball had gone dead and Victorian wicket-keeper Ben Barnett broke the stumps. A displeased Fingleton was given out by umpire George Borwick and walked off the ground, only to be called back by captain Woodfull. Fingleton refused Woodfull's offer and did not return until Woodfull successfully asked Borwick to reverse his decision. The media reported that Fingleton had quarrelled with Woodfull and several teammates told him that his apparent rebuff of the national captain would prejudice his chances of selection, and the NSWCA made an inquiry into the matter; Fingleton failed to respond. During the same innings, Bradman also wrote in his newspaper report that Fingleton had been responsible for the run out of teammate Ray Rowe, which angered Fingleton for an extended period.|$|E

5|$|The party gained over 7% in four constituencies. Much media {{attention}} {{was focused on}} the seat of Putney, where Goldsmith had stood as the Referendum candidate against incumbent Conservative MP David Mellor; Goldsmith secured 3.5% of the local vote and the seat was won by the Labour candidate. Although it failed to win any seats, the party exhibited the strongest performance of a minor party in recent UK political history. Support had been strongest in the south and east of England, in particular in areas with high elderly populations and high rates of agricultural employment. Support for the party was considerably weaker in Inner London, Northern England, and Scotland; it secured only 1.1% of the Scottish vote. This may <b>have</b> <b>reflected</b> greater pro-EU sentiment in Scotland or a perception that the Referendum Party's Euroscepticism was a form of English nationalism rather than British nationalism. The Referendum Party had proved more electorally successful than its Eurosceptic rival, UKIP, which averaged 1.2% of the vote in the 194 constituencies that it contested.|$|E

25|$|Before {{becoming}} a territory, varying cultures {{of indigenous peoples}} and historic Native Americans inhabited Indiana for thousands of years. Since its founding as a territory, settlement patterns in Indiana <b>have</b> <b>reflected</b> regional cultural segmentation present in the Eastern United States; the state's northernmost tier was settled primarily by people from New England and New York, Central Indiana by migrants from the Mid-Atlantic states and from adjacent Ohio, and Southern Indiana by settlers from the Southern states, particularly Kentucky and Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the chief}} {{paintings}} {{in a show of}} 13 of Sage’s oils at the Viviano Gallery in November 1958 was called The Answer Is No. This seems to <b>have</b> <b>reflected</b> Sage’s own state of mind. She filed her will in Waterbury in December 1958, and on April 28–29, 1959, a few weeks after she completed a massive catalogue of Tanguy’s paintings, she attempted to end her life with an overdose of sleeping pills. A housekeeper found her, however, and she was revived.|$|E
25|$|A study {{comparing}} {{the outcomes of}} all patients in New York state treated with CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) demonstrated CABG was superior to PCI with DES in multivessel (more than one diseased artery) coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients treated with CABG had lower rates of death and of death or myocardial infarction than treatment with a coronary stent. Patients undergoing CABG also had lower rates of repeat revascularization. The New York State registry included all patients undergoing revascularization for coronary artery disease, but was not a randomized trial, and so may <b>have</b> <b>reflected</b> other factors besides the method of coronary revascularization.|$|E
