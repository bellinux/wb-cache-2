But neither are these subdivisions as firmly <b>delimited</b> <b>as</b> it might seem, nor are they particularly diverse (several Amphisbatinae taxa are monotypic). Thus, the Amphisbatinae are here not divided into tribes pending the availability of more thorough phylogenetic studies and better information on the subfamily's scope and relationships.|$|E

5000|$|Ifá is a divination {{system that}} {{represents}} the oracular utterance of Odù, who {{is also known as}} Odùduwà. Linguist and cultural historian Modupe Oduyoye reveals that the meaning of Odùduwà is Odù-ó dá ìwà [...] "Oracular utterance created existence." [...] The system that Odù devised for human beings to manifest their destiny is called Odù Ifá, and the chief emissary of Odù Ifá is Orisha Orunmila. Both Babaláwo and Iyanífa use Ifá and its tools, including the divining chain known as Opele or the sacred palm nuts called Ikin, on the traditionally wooden divination tray called Opon Ifá, to help their clients better understand the paths in life. The term Iyanífa specifically relates to Ifá, and is <b>delimited</b> <b>as</b> such. However, the term Iyaláwo indicates a woman who has knowledge of sacred wisdom that includes and goes beyond Ifá. The significance of the Iyaláwo in Yoruba cosmology is said to extend to its creator, Odù. In The Architects of Existence: Àjẹ́ in Yoruba Cosmology, Ontology, and Orature, Teresa N.

50|$|Situated {{at the top}} of {{the hill}} that {{separates}} Lloret de Mar and Fenals beaches, it dates back to the turn of the 11th century. The castle served as a watchtower to warn of possible attacks from the sea. The origins of the Castle of Sant Joan are the origins of the town of Lloret. Back in the 11th century, the area of land <b>delimited</b> <b>as</b> Loredo was ruled over by Sicardis of Lloret (1031-1103). According to the terms of Sicardis' will, the feudal land was to be shared between two of her sons: Bernat Umbert, Bishop of Girona, and Bernat Gaufred, a secular lord who became Lord of Palafolls. This shared jurisdiction lasted until 1218, when Bishop Bernat Umbert died and his fief passed exclusively to the See of the Chapter of Girona Cathedral. In 1790, the Comú (Town Council) and the inhabitants of Lloret asked the Royal Council of the Treasury ("Real Consejo de Hacienda") to make the castle and its land royal property in exchange for the payment of 8,000 pounds to the Cathedral Chapter for its loss of ownership rights. The legal dispute, which lasted until 1802, was decided in favour of Lloret's inhabitants, bringing almost eight centuries of feudal rule to an end, although the Castle of Sant Joan belonged to the Chapter until 1807. The Third Coalition War that pitted Great Britain against Spain and France, and which concluded at the Battle of Trafalgar, had disastrous consequences for the tower of the Castle of Sant Joan. In 1805 the British Navy bombed the tower, destroying the fortified enclosure once and for all. The castle remained in disuse throughout the 19th century and was reduced to ruins. The restoration of the keep, which is now open to visitors, was completed in 1992. Meanwhile, the excavations and the museological project were completed between 2000 and 2001.|$|E

40|$|Neural {{processes}} are explored through macroscopic neuroimaging and microscopic molecular measures, {{but the two}} levels remain primarily detached. The identification of direct links between the levels would facilitate use of imaging signals as probes of genetic function and, vice versa, access to molecular correlates of imaging measures. Neuroimaging patterns have been mapped for a few isolated genes, chosen based on their connection with a clinical disorder. Here we propose an approach that allows an unrestricted discovery of the genetic basis of a neuroimaging phenotype in the normal human brain. The essential components are a subject population that is composed of relatives and selection of a neuroimaging phenotype that is reproducible within an individual and similar between relatives but markedly variable across a population. Our present combined magnetoencephalography and genome-wide linkage study in 212 healthy siblings demonstrates that auditory cortical activation strength is highly heritable and, specifically in the right hemisphere, regulated oligogenically with linkages to chromosomes 2 q 37, 3 p 12, and 8 q 24. The identified regions <b>delimit</b> <b>as</b> candidate genes TRAPPC 9, operating in neuronal differentiation, and ROBO 1, regulating projections of thalamocortical axons. Identification of normal genetic variation underlying neurophysiological phenotypes offers a non-invasive platform for an in-depth, concerted capitalization of molecular and neuroimaging levels in exploring neural function.

The primary gene pool (GP- 1) {{is composed of}} gene reservoirs that cross easily with the domesticate and the crosses produce fertile offspring regularly. The secondary (GP- 2) and tertiary (GP- 3) gene pools comprise gene sources that cross with variable degrees of diffilculty with the crop species, this implies less close genetic distances. The GP- 1 is further subdivided in cultivated and wild gene pools. The cultivated gene pool englobes commercial stocks of the crop besides indigenous landraces and folk varieties of the domesticate. The wild GP- 1 of a crop comprises putative ancestors and closely related species that show a fair degree of fertile relationships with the domesticate. Two Douth American wild subspecies of cassava (M. flabellifolia and M. peruviana) are natural members of the wild GP- 1 of the species.
