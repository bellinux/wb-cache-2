40|$|EFA ` 99 {{covered the}} use of light {{throughout}} 1 : 1 simulation. As a rule the field of light design has a closer relation with simulation in true scale. Therefore, {{it is surprising that}} a conference dealing with this field did not take place at an earlier stage which might be due to the differing approaches concerning implementation and working focus at the various laboratories. The remarkable achievements of the <b>individual</b> <b>lighting</b> companies on the market regarding research work seem very promising and necessarily are to be duly acknowledged also on the part of academic circles. Furthermore, a productive exchange of information might develop between the, somewhat incompatibly seeming, interest groups. More interaction would surely prove wise, as the stage for successful research work in the field of light design and light impact is only to be set by combining all strengths...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a post-occupancy {{study of the}} lighting environment in a green office. A multiple-tool methodology was developed and tested, which included occupant surveys, interviews, illuminance measurements, sky view analyses by a fisheye-lens camera, examinations of the lighting control scheme, and user behaviour observations. Occupants reported an overall satisfied rating of the lighting environment. The dissatisfaction sources identified were reflected glare from other buildings and lack of <b>individual</b> <b>lighting</b> control. Two design suggestions were generated to inform lighting environmental design. First, effective glare control systems like shadings and thick blinds {{should be considered in}} daylighting design in a compact urban environment; secondly, individual task lights should be adopted to increase occupantsâ€™ comfort by enabling them to adjust the workspace to their individual needs. In sum, the tool-kit is proved to be able to identify satisfaction levels and dissatisfaction sources...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} two experiments {{concerning the}} effects of variations in lighting quality on office worker performance, health, and well-being. Experi-ment 1 had four experimental conditions: a regular array of fully direct recessed parabolic luminaires; direct/indirect luminaires with no control; direct/indirect luminaires with a switchable desk lamp; and, workstation-specific direct/indirect luminaires with control over the direct portion. Experiment 2 contrasted two conditions with no <b>individual</b> <b>lighting</b> control: a regular array of recessed prismatic lensed luminaires, and suspended direct/indirect luminaires. Particip-ants considered the direct/indirect systems to be more comfortable than the direct-only systems, with a further increase in comfort associated with individual control in Experiment 1. There were no simple main effects of lighting quality {{on the performance of}} any task, although the expected changes in performance associated with task visibility, practice, and fatigue were found. Interactions between lighting quality and time suggested that having a degree of individual control of lighting tended to maintain motivation and vigilance over the day. 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{for determining the}} yields and properties of <b>individual</b> <b>light</b> quark flavours in Z^ 0 decays that is essentially free of detailed assumptions about hadronisation. The method uses an equation system {{with the number of}} events which are single and double tagged by high energy hadrons as inputs. In addition, SU(2) isospin symmetry and the flavour independence of QCD are used to derive general relations between hadron production from the various primary light quarks. Assuming the branching fractions R_q of the Z^ 0 into down and strange quarks to be the same, five million hadronic Z^ 0 decays may allow a precisions of Î´(R_d=R_s) /(R_d=R_s) âˆ¼ 0. 05 and Î´ A_FB(d=s) âˆ¼Î´ A_FB(u) âˆ¼ 0. 015 for the corresponding asymmetries. The method can be extended to include somewhat more model dependent symmetries of hadron production, which then allows the electroweak observables for each of the <b>individual</b> <b>light</b> quarks to be determined...|$|R
