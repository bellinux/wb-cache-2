25|$|An IoT-enabled {{intelligent}} system of such cases was proposed in 2001 and later demonstrated in 2014 by the National Science Foundation Industry/University Collaborative Research Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) at the University of Cincinnati on {{a band saw}} machine in IMTS 2014 in Chicago. Band saw machines are not necessarily expensive, but the band saw belt expenses are enormous since they degrade much faster. However, without sensing and intelligent analytics, it can be only determined by experience when the band saw belt will actually break. The developed prognostics system {{will be able to}} recognize and monitor the degradation of band saw belts even if the condition is changing, advising users when <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>time</b> to replace band saw. This will significantly improve user experience and operator safety and ultimately save on costs.|$|E

Beyond comparison the night <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>time</b> for this place; a merciful darkness hides the dirt of the waters, and the lights of this transitional age, red glaring orange, gas-yellow, and electric white, are set in shadowy outlines of every possible shade between grey and deep purple. Through the arches of Waterloo Bridge a hundred points of light mark the sweep of the Embankment, and above its parapet rise the towers of Westminster, warm grey against the starlight. The black river goes by with only a rare ripple breaking its silence, and disturbing the reflections of the lights that swim upon its surface.|$|E
