5|$|Emotions {{contains}} influences from mostly 1950s, 1960s and 1970s balladry and gospel, {{as well as}} her continued work of R and soul. The album, while {{praised by}} some as more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort, while selling far less and failed to introduce Carey into a different market. Following these events, Columbia <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to market Carey in a similar fashion to her debut, only having her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly album. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals, and soften the album's production, leaving a more contemporary pop/R record. Agreeing to the change, Carey and Afanasieff began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, Music Box.|$|E

The mill closed in January 1891, due to the high costs of importing sulphide from the United States.
