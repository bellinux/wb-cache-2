5|$|Developed {{over many}} centuries, Kraków {{provides}} a showcase setting for many historic styles of architecture. As the city expanded, so too did the architectural achievements of its builders. It {{is for this}} reason that the variations <b>in</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> urban planning are so easily recognisable.|$|E
5|$|Monument 16 and Monument17 are {{two parts}} of the same broken {{sculpture}}. This sculpture is classically Olmec <b>in</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> is heavily eroded but represents a human head wearing a headdress {{in the form of a}} secondary face wearing a helmet.|$|E
5|$|Psychedelic rock is {{a diverse}} style of rock music inspired, influenced, or {{representative}} of psychedelic culture, which is centred around perception-changing hallucinogenic drugs. Psychedelic rock {{is intended to}} replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. Many psychedelic groups differ <b>in</b> <b>style,</b> <b>and</b> the label is often used indiscriminately.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} On the Art of the Cinema on North Korean filmmaking is disputed. Films from {{before and after}} the {{publication}} of the treatise are similar <b>in</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> many contemporary films breach various rules laid out in the treatise.|$|E
5|$|Although the Gospel of John is anonymous, Christian {{tradition}} {{historically has}} attributed it to John the Apostle, son of Zebedee {{and one of}} Jesus' Twelve Apostles. The gospel is so closely related <b>in</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> content to the three surviving Johannine epistles that commentators treat the four books, along with the Book of Revelation, as a single corpus of Johannine literature, albeit not necessarily written by the same author.|$|E
5|$|Although the Romans {{had a more}} hostile {{attitude}} {{than the}} Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued. The art of mummy portraiture flourished, and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not {{to the extent that}} the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman <b>in</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> closed to native Egyptians.|$|E

5|$|At the {{northern}} end of the undercroft is the passage known as the outer parlour. This has stone benches on each side and elaborately carved blind arcades above them. The arcades each consist of two groups of four round-headed arches with capitals, free-standing columns and bases that are set on the benches. The capitals and mouldings of the arches are decorated with a variety of carvings, the capitals being predominantly late Romanesque <b>in</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> the arches early Gothic. The carvings include depictions of human heads, stiff-leaf foliage and animals.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the newest}} {{building}} began on December 4, 1936. The third state capitol was completed in 1938 and is the fourth-newest capitol in the United States. The capitol was dedicated on October 1, 1938, with speeches from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Leslie M. Scott, Robert W. Sawyer, and Oregon Governor Charles Henry Martin. Chosen from 123 entries in a countrywide competition, {{the design of the}} new building deviated from the normal design of state capitol buildings. The design was labeled a combination of Egyptian simplicity and Greek refinement. Overall it is Art Deco <b>in</b> <b>style,</b> <b>and</b> is one of only three state capitols in the United States constructed in that architectural style.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{was born}} in Point Fortin, Trinidad and Tobago, to Lydia and Pamphile. and he {{attended}} St. Anthony's College in Trinidad along with his future Sunderland team-mate Carlos Edwards. His uncle, Philibert Jones was also a footballer as a prolific forward for Strike Squad that came within a point of qualifying for the 1990 World Cup and was a similar player to Kenwyne; both <b>in</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> celebration. His athleticism and pace, which Sunderland considered attractive, was not established until he joined Sheffield Wednesday in September and began to show his potential.|$|E

5|$|Kilmer is {{considered}} among {{the last of the}} Romantic era poets because his verse is conservative and traditional <b>in</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> does not break any of the formal rules of poetics—a style often criticized today for being too sentimental to be taken seriously. The entire corpus of Kilmer's work was produced between 1909 and 1918 when Romanticism and sentimental lyric poetry fell out of favor and Modernism took root—especially with the influence of the Lost Generation. In the years after Kilmer's death, poetry went in drastically different directions, as is seen in the work of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, and academic criticism grew with it to eschew the more sentimental and straightforward verse.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels is a 1986 side-scrolling, {{platform}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Nintendo as the first sequel to their 1985 bestseller Super Mario Bros. The games are similar <b>in</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> gameplay, apart from a steep increase in difficulty. Like the original, Mario or Luigi venture to rescue the Princess from Bowser. Unlike the original, the game has no two-player option and Luigi is differentiated from his twin plumber brother with reduced ground friction and increased jump height. The Lost Levels also introduces setbacks such as poison mushroom power-ups, counterproductive level warps, and mid-air wind gusts. The game has 32 levels across eight worlds, and five bonus worlds.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Brunanburh is an Old English poem. It is {{preserved}} in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a historical record of events in Anglo-Saxon England which was kept from the late ninth to the mid-twelfth century. The poem records the Battle of Brunanburh, a battle fought in 937 between an English army and a combined army of Scots, Vikings, and Britons. The battle resulted in an English victory, celebrated by the poem <b>in</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> language like that of traditional Old English battle poetry. The poem is notable because of those traditional elements and has been praised for its authentic tone, {{but it is also}} remarkable for its fiercely nationalistic tone, which documents the development of a unified England ruled by the House of Wessex.|$|E

5|$|The Lost Levels is a side-scrolling, {{platformer}} action game similar <b>in</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> gameplay to {{the original}} 1985 Super Mario Bros., save {{for an increase in}} difficulty. As in the original, Mario (or Luigi) venture to rescue the Princess from Bowser. The player jumps between platforms, avoids enemy and inanimate obstacles, finds hidden secrets (such as warp zones and vertical vines), and collects power-ups like the mushroom (which makes Mario grow), the Fire Flower (which lets Mario throw fireballs), and the Invincibility Star. Unlike the original, there is no two-player mode but at the title screen, the player chooses between the twin plumbers, who are differentiated for the first time: Luigi, designed for skilled players, has less ground friction and higher jump height, while Mario is faster.|$|E
5|$|The {{north end}} of the station {{features}} a light-red brick and green-roof building that contains space for use by the train and bus operators. The building is postmodern <b>in</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> includes rose windows, false chimneys, and gables. The entire station was designed by the architectural firm OTAK Inc. and also includes an electrical substation. Hatfield's name is etched in the façade of the main station building in stone.|$|E
5|$|There are extant liturgical vestments {{containing}} embroidered figures, {{including that}} of St. Barbara, in Lochner's style and with similar facial types. This has led to some speculation whether Lochner provided the models. In addition a number of contemporary stained glass panels are similar <b>in</b> <b>style,</b> <b>and</b> there has been debate whether {{he might have been}} responsible for church murals; the over-life size figures of the Dombild and Virgin with the Violet indicate his ability to work on a monumental scale.|$|E

5|$|Being ambitious, Grill {{aimed for}} the higher {{positions}} in the SOIC, and to achieve {{that he had to}} learn more and gain more experience. So when he returned to Sweden from China, he decided to go abroad again as soon as possible. He started out at the trading office of Kristian Holm, Swedish consul to France, in Montpellier where he worked for about six months. He stayed in France for five years, and in 1758, he was employed by the Mallet & Blancheney firm in Marseille. Grill's letters to his family during those years indicates that he enjoyed his time in France and was interested <b>in</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> his own appearance. His initial plans had been to set up a business in Marseille, but his family, especially his uncle Claes Grill, advised against it. Claes had started out as a merchant in the European market, but he soon moved on to the more lucrative Canton trade and encouraged his nephew to do the same.|$|E
5|$|Drawings {{scratched}} on slate {{have been}} found of dragon-prowed ships, portraits {{of an old man}} and of a young, bearded man and of a four-legged animal. The drawings were found in the Viking levels but are Pictish <b>in</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> may either pre-date the arrival of the Norse or indicate a continuity of art and culture from one period to the next. Similarly, although the rectangular shape of the Norse-era buildings are quite unlike the earlier rounded Pictish style, the basement courses of the two periods are constructed in the same way. The Viking-style loom weights, spindle whorls and other vessels were found with stone discs and other objects of a Pictish design. A bronzegilt harness mounting made in Ireland in the 8th or 9th centuries has also been found and many items from this period are in the Shetland Museum. Jarlshof contains the most extensive remains of a Viking site visible anywhere in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Remi {{developed}} {{a love of}} cinema, favouring Winsor McCay's Gertie the Dinosaur and the films of Charlie Chaplin, Harry Langdon and Buster Keaton; his later work in the comic strip medium displayed an obvious influence from them <b>in</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> content. Although not a keen reader, he enjoyed the novels of British and American authors, such as Huckleberry Finn, Treasure Island, Robinson Crusoe and The Pickwick Papers, {{as well as the}} novels of Frenchman Alexandre Dumas. Drawing as a hobby, he sketched out scenes from daily life along the edges of his school books. Some of these illustrations were of German soldiers, because his four years of primary schooling at the Ixelles Municipal School No. 3 coincided with the First World War, during which Brussels was occupied by the German army. In 1919, his secondary education began at the secular Place de Londres in Ixelles, but in 1920 he was moved to Saint-Boniface School, an institution controlled by the archbishop where the teachers were Roman Catholic priests. Remi proved a successful student, being awarded prizes for excellence. He completed his secondary education in July 1925 as the top of his class.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{considerable}} growth {{in the use of}} flexible methods of delivery for workplace learning and development. However, in designing programmes of flexible learning there is often the assumption that learners will exhibit uniformity in {{the ways in which they}} process and organise information (cognitive <b>style),</b> <b>in</b> their predispositions towards particular learning formats and media (instructional preferences) and the conscious actions they employ to deal with the demands of specific learning situations (learning strategies). In adopting such a stance one runs the risk of ignoring important aspects of individual differences <b>in</b> <b>styles,</b> preferences <b>and</b> strategies. Our purpose in this paper will be to: (i) consider some aspects of individual difference that are pertinent to the delivery of flexible learning in the workplace; (ii) identify some of the challenges that extant differences <b>in</b> <b>styles</b> <b>and</b> preferences between individuals may raise for instructional designers and learning facilitators; (iii) suggest ways in which models of flexible learning design and delivery may acknowledge and accommodate individual differences <b>in</b> <b>styles</b> <b>and</b> preferences through the use of an appropriate range of instructional design, learning and support strategies. <br /...|$|R
