This was based on an established need by the Strides <b>To</b> <b>Success</b> staff and Action Council to implement training for the partners and volunteers that work directly with the program and the program participants. Strides <b>To</b> <b>Success</b> is an early intementiodprevention youth development program designed to provide children who exhibit at-risk behavior the education and support key need to make healthy decisions, build personal assets, and develop competencies. Youth learn non-violent conflict resolution skills, encouraging success in school with more intervention, providing interaction with adult role models, nourishing a positive self image, and developing an awareness and respect for others in the Strides <b>To</b> <b>Success</b> program. Leading the I Wq, is a program which involves high school students who participated in Strides <b>To</b> <b>Success</b> I during middle school. It employs selected high school students through Strides <b>To</b> <b>Success</b> <b>to</b> tutor middle school students and assist in program facilitation.

Eighty (80) respondents who compete in sport on international, national, provincial and school level {{were used for}} this study. Data were collected by employing the Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQ), the Self-Theory Questionnaire that measured if the participants have a fixed- or growth mindset, {{as well as a}} questionnaire that was specifically developed to determine the participant’s reaction <b>to</b> <b>success</b> and failure. Descriptive statistics as well as inferential statistics were used to determine significant correlations between the psychological constructs and significant differences between the different levels of participation. The results indicated that the participant’s reaction <b>to</b> <b>success</b> and failure is much more positive than negative. In terms of how ego- and task orientation relate to the participant’s reaction <b>to</b> <b>success</b> and failure, it was found that task orientation and the growth mindset relate strongly to a more positive reaction <b>to</b> <b>success</b> and failure. The role of the different levels of participation on the reaction <b>to</b> <b>success</b> and failure showed surprisingly that respondents, who participate at school and provincial levels showed a more positive reaction to failure than those who compete on a national and international levels...|$|R

40|$|School foodservice {{operations}} {{make up a}} {{large portion}} of the non-commercial foodservice industry. The number of Farm to school (FTS) programs has increased considerably within the school foodservice industry and provide opportunities to source ingredients locally. Due to the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act, school foodservice employees are faced with the challenge of providing increased amounts of produce to students. FTS programs are being used to help meet this challenge. This study focused on identifying barriers and keys <b>to</b> <b>success</b> when using local produce from FTS programs as well as identifying and assessing differences between barriers and keys <b>to</b> <b>success</b> based on geographic location, and school lunch participation rates. Interviews and a questionnaire were used to identify barriers and keys <b>to</b> <b>success.</b> Barriers identified through interviews included appearance, shelf life, service to students, and availability. Keys <b>to</b> <b>success</b> included exposure and support, service, and employee motivation. In the questionnaire, a five point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) was used to assess participants 2 ̆ 7 agreement to statements about barriers and keys <b>to</b> <b>success.</b> The barrier items with the highest mean scores were 2 ̆ 2 local produce has a different appearance than non-local produce 2 ̆ 2 (M= 3. 67), 2 ̆ 2 the quality of local produce is better than non-local produce 2 ̆ 2 (M= 3. 61), and 2 ̆ 2 local produce is less available than non-local produce (M= 3. 34) 2 ̆ 2. Keys <b>to</b> <b>success</b> with the highest mean scores included 2 ̆ 2 staff encouraging students to try local produce 2 ̆ 2 (M= 4. 15), 2 ̆ 2 exposing students to local produce consistently 2 ̆ 2 (M= 4. 08), and 2 ̆ 2 presenting local produce attractively to students 2 ̆ 2 (M= 4. 08). Mean scores of agreement toward barriers and keys <b>to</b> <b>success</b> were compared <b>to</b> identify differences between barriers and keys <b>to</b> <b>success</b> based on geographic location and school lunch participation rates. Significant differences based on geographic location and school lunch participation rates were identified at the p 3 ̆c. 05 level. There were no significant differences identified between keys <b>to</b> <b>success</b> based on school lunch participation rates. It is important for directors to understand the specific barriers and keys <b>to</b> <b>success</b> when implementing and maintaining FTS programs. Results from this study provide information that directors can use to help hourly employees overcome barriers through training and implementation of keys <b>to</b> <b>success...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the alternative education model, the Bridges <b>to</b> <b>Success</b> Program, and the program’s impact on teachers teaching within the program in a middle school in the Upstate of South Carolina. The Bridges <b>to</b> <b>Success</b> Program was initiated in September 2009 for at-risk students in eighth grade with a history of poor attendance, behavior issues, and low math and reading academic performance. The evaluation model used was the Logic Model. The research questions set the framework for this study. Research questions focused on short-term outcomes that evaluated how teacher knowledge of at-risk students changed as well as how their knowledge of their own teaching skills and instructional strategies changed from teaching within the Bridges <b>to</b> <b>Success</b> Program. Another research question focused on intermediate outcomes that would demonstrate if teacher behavior and attitudes had changed as a result of the implementation of the Bridges <b>to</b> <b>Success</b> Program. The final research question focused on the long-term outcomes that revealed the impact of the Bridges <b>to</b> <b>Success</b> Program on the culture of the eighth grade. The researcher used surveys and focus group interviews with the staff to answer the research questions. Participants for this study included Bridges <b>to</b> <b>Success</b> Program teachers and eighth-grade teachers within the school of the study. The data methods were studied individually for trends as well as combined for themes across all data methods. The data were shared in frequency distribution tables. Each of the outcomes was addressed, and evidence from the study was provided as to the impact to the teachers in this study. The study revealed the impact of the Bridges <b>to</b> <b>Success</b> Program on the teachers within the Bridges <b>to</b> <b>Success</b> Program. An analysis of the data showed that the Bridges <b>to</b> <b>Success</b> Program had a positive impact on teacher knowledge, behaviors, attitude, and overall culture in the eighth grade of the school in the study. Themes that contributed to the positive impact were caring teachers who set high expectations, engaging parents, developing self-efficacy in students, incorporating professional development, and single-gender education...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: First Step <b>to</b> <b>Success</b> is a manualized early {{intervention}} program with documented success {{in reducing the}} problem behavior of young children. Walker and colleagues (2005) are now engaged in analyses of variables that will increase the proportion of children for whom First Step is effective. A possible enhancement to the First Step <b>to</b> <b>Success</b> protocol {{is the use of}} functional behavioral assessment and individualized, function-based behavior support. The present analysis provides a case study with one 6 -year-old student who received First Step <b>to</b> <b>Success.</b> Following the coaching phase of First Step, a reversal design was employed in which function-based features of behavior support were withdrawn and then re-implemented. Analy-sis of problem behavior and academic engagement data suggests that incorporation of function-based features enhanced the impact of First Step <b>to</b> <b>Success.</b> Implications for modifications of the First Step protocol and future research are provided...|$|R
