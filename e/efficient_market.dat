40|$|ABSTRACT. Impending {{changes in}} social {{security}} {{as well as in}} corporate and government policies are making individuals more responsible for their retirement savings. As a result, knowledge of investing concepts and financial markets is more important than ever before. The <b>efficient</b> <b>markets</b> hypothesis, the dominant financial markets theory, is described and analyzed. In doing so assumptions are questioned and the three forms of market efficiency are evaluated in quantitative and qualitative fashion to determine whether the <b>efficient</b> <b>markets</b> hypothesis is an accurate view of financial markets. This paper concludes that the <b>efficient</b> <b>markets</b> hypothesis does not accurately describe U. S. stock market activity...|$|R
25|$|A novel {{approach}} for testing the weak {{form of the}} <b>Efficient</b> <b>Market</b> Hypothesis is using quantifers derived from Information Theory. In this line, Zunino et al. found that informational efficiency is related to market size and the stage of development of the economy. Using a similar technique, Bariviera et al. uncover the impact of important economic events on informational efficiency. The methodology proposed by econophysicists Zunino, Bariviera and coauthors is new and alternative to usual econometric techniques, {{and is able to}} detect changes in the stochastic and or chaotic underlying dynamics of prices time series.|$|E

The author refers to Keynes's view that an over-reliance on maths is a mistake, because mathematical models will always depend on the validity of their underlying assumptions. Skidelsky says that modern mainstream macroeconomics has become closely integrated with maths, {{at the expense of other}} disciplines such as political economy and history, and that this is partly why it became so unreliable at making accurate predictions or offering good advice. Various schools of thought within modern economics are briefly discussed, such as rational expectations, real business cycle theory and <b>efficient</b> <b>market</b> theory.|$|E

2500|$|Brunnermeier’s {{research}} lies at {{the intersection}} of international macro, monetary and financial economics. He primarily studies distortions caused by financial frictions.

[...] Faced with the empirical evidence that asset prices diverged from their fundamentals during the dot-com bubble, Brunnermeier crafted a model of trading where participants in the market would recognize bubbles in asset prices but continue to trade [...] "into the wind". [...] Brunnermeier's empirical paper, coauthored with Stefan Nagel documents that hedge funds were riding the dot-com bubble, won the Smith Breeden Prize in 2004.

2500|$|During the Medieval {{period in}} Europe, {{numerous}} market towns sprang up and competition between them intensified. In response to competitive pressures, towns began investing {{in developing a}} reputation for quality produce, <b>efficient</b> <b>market</b> regulation and good amenities for visitors. By the thirteenth century, English counties with important textile industries were investing in purpose built halls {{for the sale of}} cloth. London's Blackwell Hall became a centre for cloth, Bristol became associated with a particular type of cloth known as Bristol red, Stroud was known for producing fine woollen cloth, the town of Worsted became synonymous with a type of yarn; Banbury and Essex were strongly associated with cheeses. [...] Casson and Lee have argued that the chartered markets of England and Europe in medieval times were using the regional market's reputation as a sign of produce quality and that this acted as an early form of branding.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, the EMH is {{preceded by}} Hayek's (1945) {{argument}} that markets {{are the most}} effective way of aggregating the pieces of information dispersed amongst individuals within a society. Given the ability to profit from private information, self-interested traders are motivated to acquire and act on their private information. In doing so, traders contribute to more and more <b>efficient</b> <b>market</b> prices. In the competitive limit, market prices reflect all available information and prices can only move in response to news. Thus there is a very close link between EMH and the random walk hypothesis which was discussed in 1863 by Jules Regnault, a French broker. Later another French mathematician, Louis Bachelier, applied probability theory in his 1900 PhD thesis, [...] "The Theory of Speculation." [...] His work was largely ignored until the 1950s when financial economists began making heavy use of probability theory and statistics to model asset prices (in particular, options prices).|$|E

[...] Prior to 2004, the market was still characterized by limited liquidity and distressed prices with private equity funds trading at significant discounts to fair value. [...] Beginning in 2004 and extending through 2007, the secondary market transformed into a more <b>efficient</b> <b>market</b> in which assets {{for the first time}} traded at or above their estimated fair values and liquidity increased dramatically.
