50|$|Energy-dispersive X-ray {{spectroscopy}} (EDS, EDX, EDXS or XEDS), {{sometimes called}} energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) or energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDXMA), is an analytical technique {{used for the}} <b>elemental</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>or</b> chemical characterization of a sample. It relies on an interaction of some source of X-ray excitation and a sample. Its characterization capabilities are {{due in large part}} to the fundamental principle that each element has a unique atomic structure allowing a unique set of peaks on its electromagnetic emission spectrum (which is the main principle of spectroscopy).|$|E
5000|$|For organic chemists, <b>elemental</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>or</b> [...] "EA" [...] {{almost always}} refers to CHNX analysis—the {{determination}} of the mass fractions of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and heteroatoms (X) (halogens, sulfur) of a sample. This information {{was very important to}} help determine the structure of an unknown compound, as well as to help ascertain the structure and purity of a synthesized compound. In present day organic chemistry spectroscopic technics (like NMR, both 1H and 13C), mass spectrometry and chromatographic procedures have replaced EA as the primary technique for structural determination, although it still gives very useful complementary information. It is also the fastest and most inexpensive method to determine sample purity.|$|E

40|$|A {{backscatter}} Moessbauer spectrometer (BaMS) with included x ray fluorescence (XRF) {{capability for}} the Mars Environment Survey (MESUR) Mission, {{which has been}} proposed by NASA for 1998, is being developed.

40|$|In this work, the {{effectiveness}} of using Gadonanotubes (GNTs) with an external magnetic field to improve retention of transplanted adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) during cellular cardiomyoplasty was evaluated. As a high-performance T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cell tracking label, the GNTs are gadolinium-loaded carbon nanotube capsules that render MSCs magnetic when internalized. MSCs were internally labeled with either superparamagnetic GNTs or colloidal diamagnetic lutetium (Lu). In vitro cell rolling assays and ex vivo cardiac perfusion experiments qualitatively demonstrated increased magnetic-assisted retention of GNT-labeled MSCs. Subsequent in vivo epicardial cell injections were performed around a 1. 3  T NdFeB ring magnet sutured onto the left ventricle of female juvenile pigs (n =  21). Cell dosage, magnet exposure time, and endpoints were varied to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the proposed therapy. Quantification of retained cells in collected tissues by <b>elemental</b> <b>analysis</b> (Gd <b>or</b> Lu) showed that the external magnet helped retain nearly three times more GNT-labeled MSCs than Lu-labeled cells. The sutured magnet was tolerated for up to 168  h; however, an inflammatory response to the magnet was noted after 48  h.

40|$|Abstract The {{first part}} of this work {{consisted}} of a study of the coordination chemistry of aromatic (P,S) and (P,O) heterodonor phosphanes with Cr(CO) 6, Mo(CO) 6 and W(CO) 6. The (P,S) donor ligands having one or two o -thiomethoxyphenyl groups, preferred bidentate coordination mode, while the (P,O) donor ligands, having one, two or three o -methoxyphenyls, formed monodentate phosphorus bound complexes. Steric and electronic parameters affecting the coordination chemistry of the phosphanes are discussed for the monodentate complexes. In the second part, triphenylphosphane and 2 - and 4 -pyridyldiphenylphosphane substituted tungsten tetracarbonyl derivatives was prepared, and attractive intramolecular interactions between the phosphane ligands were studied for both the neutral and the protonated complexes. Hydrogen bonding, π -stacking and cation-π bonding interactions were established, and observed to influence the cis/trans isomerism of the complexes. Cis/trans isomerism could be tuned by protonation, and deprotonation of the pyridyldiphenylphosphane derivatives. All the complexes were characterised by 1 H, 13 C-{ 1 H} and 31 P-{ 1 H} NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, IR spectroscopy, and either <b>elemental</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>or</b> mass spectroscopy...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} a polymer waste, originating from polyorganosiloxane polymerization processes, prior its end-of-life treatment {{in order to}} identify and quantify the possibly contained nano-fillers. The polymer waste was first characterized in terms of its physical–chemical properties by combining different approaches and analytic techniques such as standard ultimate and <b>elemental</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>or</b> techniques like infrared spectroscopy or thermogravimetric analysis coupled with gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy to define the polymer waste molecular structure. The second step was devoted to identify and characterize the nano-fillers contained in the polymer waste, if any, in terms of particle size distribution, morphology and composition. Due to the thermal degradability of the polymer waste above 50 °C, the cryo-ultramicrotomy and the transmission electron microscopy techniques were used. Polydimethylsiloxane was identified as the core polymer unit, and the presence of the suspected SiO 2 nano-fillers was confirmed, with three different morphologies detected: elongated and hexagonal, both found in the particle size range of 100 – 500 nm in diameter; and spherical, present in the population of particles ≤ 100 nm in diameter.
