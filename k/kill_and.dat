5|$|Some {{species of}} {{bacteria}} <b>kill</b> <b>and</b> then consume other microorganisms, these species are called predatory bacteria. These include organisms such as Myxococcus xanthus, which forms swarms of cells that <b>kill</b> <b>and</b> digest any bacteria they encounter. Other bacterial predators either attach to their prey {{in order to}} digest them and absorb nutrients, such as Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus, or invade another cell and multiply inside the cytosol, such as Daptobacter. These predatory bacteria {{are thought to have}} evolved from saprophages that consumed dead microorganisms, through adaptations that allowed them to entrap and kill other organisms.|$|E
5|$|The young James Bond gains his licence to <b>kill</b> <b>and</b> {{status as}} a 00 agent by assassinating the traitorous MI6 section chief Dryden at the British Embassy in Prague, {{as well as his}} {{terrorist}} contact, Fisher, in a bathroom in Mumbai, India.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{have been}} documented using lures to hunt prey such as birds. This means {{they are among the}} first reptiles recorded to use tools. By balancing sticks and branches on their heads, American alligators are able to lure birds looking for suitable nesting material to <b>kill</b> <b>and</b> consume. This strategy, which is shared by the mugger crocodile, is particularly effective during the nesting season, in which birds are more likely to gather appropriate nesting materials.|$|E
50|$|For the Eight-Nation Alliance, Tientsin was {{the bloodiest}} {{battle of the}} Boxer Rebellion. Two hundred and fifty {{soldiers}} of the allied armies were <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> about 500 wounded. The Japanese lost 320 <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> wounded; the Russians <b>and</b> Germans 140 <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> wounded; the Americans 25 <b>killed,</b> <b>and</b> 98 wounded; the British, 17 <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> 87 wounded; and the French 13 <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> 50 wounded. Chinese casualties, military and civilian, are unknown, but probably heavy.|$|R
60|$|The British loss {{consisted}} of 26 officers <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> 73 wounded, 327 men <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> 1557 wounded. The French had only 3 officers <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> 54 wounded, 253 men <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> 1033 wounded. The Turks were not engaged. The Russians lost 45 officers <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> 101 wounded, 1762 men <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> 2720 wounded. The Allied Army had 126 guns against 96 of the Russians; but the former, {{owing to the}} nature of the ground, played but a small part in the fight.|$|R
60|$|The list of {{casualties}} was now being brought in. The Camerons, who {{had led the}} attack in line, had lost most heavily. They had fifteen <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> forty-six wounded, among them being two officers <b>killed,</b> <b>and</b> one mortally wounded. The Seaforths had one officer <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> one mortally wounded, and four others less severely; in all, six <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> twenty-seven wounded. The Lincolns had one <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> eighteen wounded; the Warwicks two <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> eighteen wounded. Many of the wounded afterwards died.|$|R
5|$|Females of P. labiata and P. schultzi try to <b>kill</b> <b>and</b> {{eat their}} mates {{during or after}} copulation, by {{twisting}} and lunging. The males wait until the females have hunched their legs, making this attack less likely. Males also try to abseil from a silk thread to approach from above, but females may manoeuvre to get the higher position. If the female moves at all, the male leaps and runs away.|$|E
5|$|He {{argues that}} across the world, cannibals {{are viewed as}} {{non-human}} entities, committing acts that no human would ordinarily perpetrate. In this way they were akin to various non-human species of animal, and Arens notes that in some societies, cannibals are believed to physically transform into different species in order to <b>kill</b> <b>and</b> consume humans.|$|E
5|$|In P. fimbriata from Queensland and in {{some other}} species, {{contests}} between males usually last only 5 to 10seconds, and only their legs make contact. Contests between Portia females are usually long and violent, and in P. fimbriata from Queensland these often including grappling that sometimes breaks a leg. A victor may evict a loser, and then eat the loser's eggs and take over the loser's web. Unlike in some other Portia species, victorious females of P. fimbriata from Queensland do not <b>kill</b> <b>and</b> eat the losers.|$|E
5|$|The French {{casualties}} were 60 <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> 194 wounded and the American {{casualties were}} 28 <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> 107 wounded: {{a grand total}} of 88 <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> 301 wounded.|$|R

5|$|Parker {{clashed with}} the Supreme Court {{on a number of}} occasions, with around two-thirds of cases appealed to the Supreme Court being upheld. In 1894, Parker gained {{national}} attention in a dispute with the Supreme Court over the case of Lafayette Hudson. Hudson was convicted of assault with intent to <b>kill</b> <b>and</b> sentenced to four years imprisonment. He appealed to the Supreme Court and was granted bail. Parker refused to release Hudson on the grounds that statute law did not provide the Supreme Court the authority to demand Hudson's release.|$|E
5|$|Samuelsson's primary {{offensive}} attribute is his shot. Rather {{than relying}} on stickhandling in the offensive zone, his primary tendency is to direct the puck towards the net, hoping for a rebound. Before becoming an offensive threat later in his career, he established himself first as a defensively responsible forward in the NHL, earning time on the penalty <b>kill</b> <b>and</b> against opposing team's top players. Strong on his skates, he is also noted to play aggressively, as well. As a result, Samuelsson {{is known as a}} versatile, two-way player.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the year, Grabner {{failed to}} score at his {{previous}} pace {{as with the}} Islanders, but was a decent addition on the penalty <b>kill</b> <b>and</b> had some hot streaks. Despite the decrease in production, the Maple Leafs had interest in bringing Grabner back, but a plethora of young players expected to make the roster the following season prevented the team from signing him.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{many other}} ants that use scent to forage for food, jack jumpers use their sight to target their prey. Like other bull ants, they are solitary when they forage, but only workers perform this role. These ants are omnivores and scavengers, {{typically}} foraging in warmer temperatures. They deliver painful stings, which {{are effective in}} both killing prey and deterring predators. Jack jumpers have smooth stingers, and can thus sting indefinitely. Jack jumper ants are skilled hunters, partially due to their excellent vision; they can even <b>kill</b> <b>and</b> devour wasps and bees. They also <b>kill</b> <b>and</b> eat other ants, such as carpenter ants (Camponotus) and feed on sweet floral secretions and other sugar solutions. Jack jumpers often hunt for spiders, and will sometimes follow their prey for a short distance, usually with small insects and small arthropods. Jack jumper ants, alongside M. simillima, have been given frozen houseflies (Musca domestica) and blowflies (Calliphoridae) as food under testing conditions. The ant has been observed to run and leap energetically at flies when they land, particularly on Acacia shrubs, plants or trees. Jack jumpers and other Myrmecia ants prey on insects such as cockroaches and crickets.|$|E
5|$|A {{grand jury}} indicted Paul Schlesselman and Daniel Cowart on November 5, 2008, on federal charges of {{threatening}} to <b>kill</b> <b>and</b> inflict bodily harm upon a major presidential candidate, conspiracy, interstate unlawful transportation of an unregistered firearm, interstate transportation of a firearm {{with the intent}} to commit a felony, transporting a short-barreled shotgun across state lines without a license and unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun. Cowart was also charged with damaging religious property and use of a firearm during a crime of violence. On November 6, Schlesselman and Cowart pleaded not guilty before a federal magistrate in Memphis, Tennessee. The two were placed into federal custody without bail. The charges carry a maximum punishment of 50 years in prison and $540,000 in fines.|$|E
5|$|After Fleming's death a {{continuation}} novel, Colonel Sun, {{was written by}} Kingsley Amis (as Robert Markham) and published in 1968. Amis had already written a literary study of Fleming's Bond novels in his 1965 work The James Bond Dossier. Although novelizations {{of two of the}} Eon Productions Bond films appeared in print, James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me and James Bond and Moonraker, both written by screenwriter Christopher Wood, the series of novels did not continue until the 1980s. In 1981 the thriller writer John Gardner picked up the series with Licence Renewed. Gardner went on to write sixteen Bond books in total; two of the books he wrote – Licence to <b>Kill</b> <b>and</b> GoldenEye – were novelizations of Eon Productions films of the same name. Gardner moved the Bond series into the 1980s, although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them. In 1996 Gardner retired from writing James Bond books due to ill health.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} five, Thrud is sent to Crom the Destroyer Orthodox Pagan Infants School, {{where he}} towers above the {{teachers}} and his fellow students. When {{one of the children}} shoots him with a pea shooter, Thrud's reaction is to <b>kill</b> <b>and</b> maim twenty-seven pupils and three teachers, leading to his expulsion from the school. Choosing to return to the wilderness rather than his adoptive parents, Thrud lives alone until, one day, he stumbles across a hidden burial chamber. Finding a small helmet and a large axe, Thrud arms himself. Finding gold and gems, he decides to return to civilisation with his newfound wealth, quickly establishing himself a reputation as a violent warrior.|$|E
5|$|Fruit, {{fish and}} wild pigs provide {{plentiful}} food, {{and at first}} the boys' life on the island is idyllic. They build a shelter and construct a small boat using their only possessions: a broken telescope, an iron-bound oar, and a small axe. Their first contact with other humans comes after several months when they observe two large outrigger canoes in the distance, one pursued by the other. The two groups of Polynesians disembark {{on the beach and}} engage in battle; the victors take fifteen prisoners, and <b>kill</b> <b>and</b> eat one immediately. But when they threaten to kill one of the three women captured, along with two children, the boys intervene to defeat the pursuers, earning them the gratitude of the chief, Tararo. The next morning they prevent another act of cannibalism. The natives leave, and the boys are alone once more.|$|E
5|$|If a P. schultzi female is mature, a male P. schultzi {{will try}} to copulate with her, or cohabit with a subadult female and copulate while she is moulting. They usually mate on a web or on a {{dragline}} made by the female, and P. schultzi typically copulates for about 100seconds, while others in the genus can take several minutes or even several hours. Females try to <b>kill</b> <b>and</b> eat their mates during or after copulation, and subadult females mimic adult females to attract males as prey. Contests between Portia females are violent, and embraces in P. schultzi typically take 20 to 60seconds. Sometimes, one female knocks the other {{on her back and}} the other may be killed and eaten if she does not right herself quickly and run way. When hunting, P. schultzi mature females emit olfactory signals that reduce the risk that any other females, males, or juveniles of the same species may contend for the same prey.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, NOU was on {{tour with}} Bikini <b>Kill,</b> <b>and</b> {{when they arrived}} in Memphis, the found that the {{promoter}} for the show hadn't actually promoted the show. So, while {{out on the town}} flyering the streets and ducking into record stores, NOU ran into Primal Scream, a band which had been in town recording their own album. Primal Scream then decided to attend NOU's show at the Antenna Club, and then proceeded to invite NOU to record with them in the studio the next day. Nation of Ulysses then recorded five songs with Primal Scream in nine hours, though of course only after a quick errand for some tin foil to smoke a bit of crack, according to Tim Green. These recordings are known as Memphis Demos, and include the demos of N-Sub Ulysses, 50,000 Watts, Mockingbird, Yeah, and Shakedown.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, the {{fin whale}} was {{occasionally}} hunted by open-boat whalers, {{but it was}} relatively safe, because it could easily outrun ships {{of the time and}} often sank when killed, making the pursuit a waste of time for whalers. However, the later introduction of steam-powered boats and harpoons that exploded on impact made it possible to <b>kill</b> <b>and</b> secure them along with blue and sei whales on an industrial scale. As other whale species became overhunted, the whaling industry turned to the still-abundant fin whale as a substitute. It was primarily hunted for its blubber, oil, and baleen. Around 704,000 fin whales were caught in Antarctic whaling operations alone between 1904 and 1975.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decade}} {{between the end}} of the Star Trek {{television}} series and the film, many of the futuristic technologies that appeared on the show—electronic doors that open automatically, hypodermic injections, talking computers, weapons that stun rather than <b>kill,</b> <b>and</b> personal communication devices—had become a reality. Roddenberry had insisted that the technology aboard the Enterprise be grounded in established science and scientific theories. The Motion Picture likewise received technical consultation from NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at California Institute of Technology, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as individuals such as a former astronaut and the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov.|$|E
