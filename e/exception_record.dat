50|$|This {{degree of}} {{chromosomal}} similarity is {{roughly equivalent to}} that found in equines. Interfertility of horses and donkeys is common, although sterility of the offspring (mules) is nearly universal (with only around 60 <b>exceptions</b> <b>recorded</b> in equine history). Similar complexities and prevalent sterility pertain to horse-zebra hybrids, or zorses, whose chromosomal disparity is very wide, with horses typically having 32 chromosome pairs and zebras between 16 and 23 depending on species. In a direct parallel to the chimp-human case, the Przewalski's Horse (Equus przewalskii) with 33 chromosome pairs, and the domestic horse (E. caballus) with 32 pairs, {{have been found to}} be interfertile, and produce semi-fertile offspring: male hybrids can breed with female domestic horses.|$|R
40|$|Thehealthcare {{services}} {{are among the}} fastest growing service markets deploying wireless technologies. As healthcare organizations continue to become more distributed, mobile handheld devices and their associated support {{has evolved into a}} viable platform for these organizations. However, one factor that hinders the deployment of the handheld technology is the lack of support for exception handling over mobile handheld devices in current workflow management systems. In this paper, we propose an extended architecture and scheme for handling the exceptions. Theproposed scheme scans through earlier <b>exception</b> <b>records</b> from a dynamic knowledge base, evaluates and suggests an appropriate solution for the current exception on the mobile handheld device. The scheme is evaluated in terms of time and accuracy compared withpreviously known schemes [6]...|$|R

50|$|The green jack {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} species of fish within its range, and as such is quite important to fisheries throughout its range. It is taken by pelagic trawls, inshore gill nets, purse nets, and seines, as well as hook and line gear. Catch statistics are not kept for the fish throughout most of its range; however, the Mexican state of Colima is one <b>exception.</b> <b>Records</b> from 1980 onward show a catch between 9 and 250 tons, with an average of 93 tons, with the catch best between September and December. Like most carangid species in the area, it is considered a lower class product, fetching between US$ 0.50 and 0.80 per kilogram, making it accessible to the low-income population. The fish are sold both for consumption and as bait, either fresh, smoked or salted. Some hope the Hawaiian population becomes commercially viable in the future, as they are often landed in other carangid catches at the present.|$|R
60|$|I {{think it}} {{unnecessary}} to repeat here any {{other of the}} anecdotes commonly related of Giotto, as, separately taken, they are quite valueless. Yet much may be gathered from their general tone. It is remarkable that they are, almost without <b>exception,</b> <b>records</b> of good-humoured jests, involving or illustrating some point of practical good sense; and by comparing this general colour of the reputation of Giotto with the actual character of his designs, there cannot remain the smallest doubt that his mind {{was one of the}} most healthy, kind, and active, that ever informed a human frame. His love of beauty was entirely free from weakness; his love of truth untinged by severity; his industry constant, without impatience; his workmanship accurate, without formalism; his temper serene, and yet playful; his imagination exhaustless, without extravagance; and his faith firm, without superstition. I do not know, in the annals of art, such another example of happy, practical, unerring, and benevolent power.|$|R

40|$|This Comment {{analyzes}} Wisconsin’s {{application of}} the business <b>records</b> <b>exception</b> when a litigant seeks the admission of third-party records. In 2010, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, in Palisades Collection LLC v. Kalal, applied a narrow interpretation of the exception’s requirements that stands in contrast to manner in which federal jurisdictions apply the exception in the same context. This Comment addresses {{the question of whether}} Wisconsin’s narrower construction of the exception is the best approach to the evidentiary rule. In doing so, this Comment first reviews the federal business <b>record</b> <b>exception,</b> its requirements, and federal courts’ treatment of the foundational requirement for third-party records. This Comment then does the same for the Wisconsin exception, discussing the challenges and harms created by Wisconsin’s narrow approach. Finally, it suggests that Wisconsin adopt an approach similar to that {{of a growing number of}} federal courts...|$|R

40|$|M. Inf. The {{introduction}} of technology {{has affected the}} service standards of most service organizations. Organizations were either negatively or positively affected. (Polokwane Municipality is no <b>exception).</b> <b>Records</b> management as a major function of service organizations needs to be developed {{to cope with the}} challenges brought about by technology. The study, therefore, investigated the possible role of electronic records management in a service organization. The aim of electronic records management is to improve service quality. By making use of an electronic records management system, organizations can render quality service. The {{introduction of}} technology in records management affects several aspects such as space, time, costs, customer satisfaction {{and the role of the}} records manager. Although technology may improve the standard of service in organizations, it is important for organizations to embark on staff development programmes. Employees should be trained to use the existing system, and encouraged to further their studies. Furthermore, organizations should encourage employees to affiliate with professional organizations, as the latter enables employees to embark on a process of lifelong learning. Once a well-trained workforce has been established, responsibilities must be allocated. Employees should be made aware of their limitations. Some should be tasked only with scanning in new information, while others could be made responsible either for maintaining or disposing of records. The most senior member of staff in the records management section should be responsible for any actions with regard to the disposal of records. Other departments such as Information Technology (IT) should assist with their expertise...|$|R
