5|$|A monohedral tiling is a {{tessellation}} {{in which}} all tiles are congruent; it has only one prototile. A particularly interesting type of monohedral tessellation is the spiral monohedral tiling. The first spiral monohedral tiling was discovered by Heinz Voderberg in 1936; the Voderberg tiling has a unit tile that is a nonconvex enneagon. The Hirschhorn tiling, published by Michael D. Hirschhorn and D. C. Hunt in 1985, is a pentagon tiling using irregular pentagons: regular pentagons cannot tile the Euclidean plane as the <b>internal</b> <b>angle</b> of a regular pentagon, , is not a divisor of 2.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, when warranted, {{specific}} tests—the mirror test, vasoconstriction examinations, and the Cottle maneuver—are {{included to}} the pre-operative {{evaluation of the}} prospective rhinoplasty patient. Established by Maurice H. Cottle (1898–1981), the Cottle maneuver is a principal diagnostic technique for detecting an internal nasal-valve disorder; whilst the patient gently inspires, the surgeon laterally pulls the patient's cheek, thereby simulating the widening of the cross-sectional area of the corresponding internal nasal valve. If the maneuver notably facilitates the patient's inspiration, that result is a positive Cottle sign—which generally indicates an airflow-correction to be surgically effected with an installed spreader-graft. Said correction will improve the <b>internal</b> <b>angle</b> of the nasal valve and thus allow unobstructed breathing. Nonetheless, the Cottle maneuver occasionally yields a false-positive Cottle sign, usually observed in the patient afflicted with alar collapse, and in the patient with a scarred nasal-valve region.|$|E
500|$|The diagram above {{shows the}} rhodium–carbon ( [...] inside pentagons on the left) and carbon–carbon ( [...] outside pentagons on the left) bond {{distances}} for both ligands, {{along with the}} bond angles ( [...] inside pentagons on the right) within each cyclopentadienyl ring. The atom labels used {{are the same as}} those shown in the crystal structure above. Within the unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligand, the carbon–carbon bond lengths vary between 1.35Å and 1.40Å and the internal bond angles vary between 107° and 109°. For comparison, the <b>internal</b> <b>angle</b> at each vertex of a regular pentagon is 108°. The rhodium–carbon bond lengths vary between 2.16Å and 2.18Å. These results are consistent with η5-coordination of the ligand to the metal centre. In the case of the substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand, there is somewhat greater variation: carbon–carbon bond lengths vary between 1.39Å and 1.48Å, the internal bond angles vary between 106° and 111°, and the rhodium–carbon bond lengths vary between 2.14Å and 2.20Å. The greater variation in the substituted ligand is attributed to the distortions necessary to relieve the steric strain imposed by neighbouring tert-butyl substituents; despite these variations, the data demonstrate that the substituted cyclopentadienyl is also η5-coordinated.|$|E
