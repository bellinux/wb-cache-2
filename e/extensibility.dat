25|$|Internet Explorer exposes {{a set of}} Component Object Model (COM) {{interfaces}} {{that allows}} add-ons to extend the functionality of the browser. <b>Extensibility</b> {{is divided into two}} types: Browser <b>extensibility</b> and content <b>extensibility.</b> Browser <b>extensibility</b> involves adding context menu entries, toolbars, menu items or Browser Helper Objects (BHO). BHOs are used to extend the feature set of the browser, whereas the other <b>extensibility</b> options are used to expose that feature in the user interface. Content <b>extensibility</b> adds support for non-native content formats. It allows Internet Explorer to handle new file formats and new protocols, e.g. WebM or SPDY. In addition, web pages can integrate widgets known as ActiveX controls which run on Windows only but have vast potentials to extend the content capabilities; Adobe Flash Player and Microsoft Silverlight are examples. Add-ons can be installed either locally, or directly by a web site.|$|E
25|$|In Internet Explorer 9, the <b>extensibility</b> {{mechanisms}} for Browser Helper Objects (BHOs) and toolbars remain the same. Not loading BHOs or toolbars improves startup time, but limits {{the ability of}} developers to augment the user experience through these <b>extensibility</b> mechanisms.|$|E

25|$|Most silks, in {{particular}} dragline silk, have exceptional mechanical properties. They exhibit a unique combination of {{high tensile strength}} and <b>extensibility</b> (ductility). This enables a silk fibre to absorb {{a large amount of}} energy before breaking (toughness, the area under a stress-strain curve).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to community cooperation and coordination, Fitzpatrick {{shows that the}} incorporation of open standards and built-in <b>extensibility</b> are crucial {{to the development of}} successful digital text preservation practices. Included in these practices are three key components: the development of standards for text markup, so that digital texts can be read across a variety of platforms; the inclusion of rich metadata, so that digital texts can be located reliably; and the preservation of access to digital texts themselves. To support her argument for social solutions, Fitzpatrick examines several successful projects concerned with the development of text markup, metadata, and access standards and practices (including TEI, DOI, and LOCKSS) and shows that each is based {{in the creation of a}} community organization that values openness and <b>extensibility.</b>|$|E
25|$|By using namespaces, XHTML {{documents}} {{could provide}} <b>extensibility</b> by including fragments from other XML-based languages such as Scalable Vector Graphics and MathML. Finally, the renewed work {{would provide an}} opportunity to divide HTML into reusable components (XHTML Modularization) and clean up untidy parts of the language.|$|E
25|$|The reticular region lies {{deep in the}} {{papillary}} {{region and}} is usually much thicker. It is composed of dense irregular connective tissue, and receives {{its name from the}} dense concentration of collagenous, elastic, and reticular fibers that weave throughout it. These protein fibers give the dermis its properties of strength, <b>extensibility,</b> and elasticity.|$|E
25|$|Winamp is a {{media player}} for Windows, Android, and macOS {{developed}} by Justin Frankel and Dmitry Boldyrev by their company Nullsoft, which they later sold to AOL, who {{sold it to}} Radionomy in January 2014. Since version 2 it has been sold as freemium and supports <b>extensibility</b> with plug-ins and skins, and features music visualization, playlist and a media library, supported by a large online community.|$|E
25|$|This design {{gave the}} Amiga OS a great <b>extensibility</b> and {{flexibility}} within the limited memory capacity of {{computers in the}} 1980s. Sassenrath later noted that the design came as a necessity of trying to integrate into ROM dozens of internal libraries and devices including graphics, sound, graphical user interface, floppy disc, file systems, and others. This dynamic modular method also allowed hundreds of additional modules to be added by external developers over the years.|$|E
25|$|Voluntary {{stretches}} to the legs, such as {{the wall}} stretch, condition the hamstrings and the calf muscle to various movements before vigorously working them. But a study has shown that Kinesiology tape gives more promising effect in hamstring <b>extensibility</b> to produce more fluid movement. Thirty previously injured males showed a greater advantage of hamstring <b>extensibility</b> in longer durations with Kinesiology tape, or elastic therapeutic tape. However, they were more advantageous {{in the beginning of}} the exercise with a voluntary, static stretch or proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, which are stretching techniques specific to optimize the range of motion of the limb. This shows that stretches do help in the immediate time frames, whereas Kinesiology tape helps in long durations to prevent any future injuries from occurring. The environment and surroundings, such as uneven terrain, can cause the feet to position in an unnatural way, so wearing shoes that can absorb forces from the groundâ€™s impact and allow for stabilizing the feet can prevent some injuries while running as well. Shoes should be structured to allow friction-traction at the shoe surface, space for different foot-strike stresses, or for comfortable, regular arches for the feet.|$|E
25|$|Elliptic {{geometry}} is {{also like}} Euclidean geometry in that space is continuous, homogeneous, isotropic, and without boundaries. Isotropy is {{guaranteed by the}} fourth postulate, that all right angles are equal. For an example of homogeneity, note that Euclid's proposition I.1 implies that the same equilateral triangle can be constructed at any location, not just in locations that are special in some way. The lack of boundaries follows from the second postulate, <b>extensibility</b> of a line segment.|$|E
25|$|Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) is {{a format}} that {{incorporates}} an extremely {{wide range of}} options. While this makes TIFF useful as a generic format for interchange between professional image editing applications, it makes adding support for it to applications a much bigger task and so it has little support in applications not concerned with image manipulation (such as web browsers). The high level of <b>extensibility</b> also means that most applications provide only a subset of possible features, potentially creating user confusion and compatibility issues.|$|E
2500|$|The Visual Studio 2010 IDE was {{redesigned}} which, {{according to}} Microsoft, clears the UI organization and [...] "reduces clutter and complexity." [...] The new IDE better supports multiple document windows and floating tool windows, while offering better multi-monitor support. The IDE shell has been rewritten using the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), whereas the internals have been redesigned using Managed <b>Extensibility</b> Framework (MEF) that offers more <b>extensibility</b> points than previous {{versions of the}} IDE that enabled add-ins to modify {{the behavior of the}} IDE.|$|E
2500|$|Apple {{intended}} Swift {{to support}} many core concepts associated with Objective-C, notably dynamic dispatch, widespread late binding, extensible programming and similar features, but [...] "safer" [...] (easier to catch software bugs); Swift has features addressing some common programming errors like null pointers and provides syntactic sugar to help avoid the pyramid of doom. Swift supports {{the concept of}} protocol <b>extensibility,</b> an <b>extensibility</b> system {{that can be applied}} to types, structs and classes, which Apple promotes as a real change in programming paradigms they term [...] "protocol-oriented programming" [...] (similar to traits).|$|E

2500|$|Emacs [...] is {{a family}} of text editors that are {{characterized}} by their <b>extensibility.</b> The manual for {{the most widely used}} variant, GNU Emacs, describes it as [...] "the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor". [...] Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s, and work on its direct descendant, GNU Emacs, continues actively [...]|$|E
2500|$|The PowerShell Extended Type System (ETS) {{is based}} on the [...]NET type system, but with {{extended}} semantics (for example, propertySets and third-party <b>extensibility).</b> For example, it enables the creation of different views of objects by exposing only a subset of the data fields, properties, and methods, as well as specifying custom formatting and sorting behavior. These views are mapped to the original object using XML-based configuration files.|$|E
2500|$|Boxee's [...] "AppBox" [...] {{app store}} [...] "App Store" [...] {{which is a}} digital {{distribution}} service platform that serves add-on apps and plug-ins that provide online content to Boxee, the [...] "AppBox" [...] allows users to download new apps and addons directly from Boxee's GUI. Many of these sources are in high definition and use streaming sites' native flash and Silverlight players. Boxee has <b>extensibility</b> and integration with online sources for free and premium streaming content.|$|E
2500|$|Windows Contacts {{is a new}} unified {{contact and}} {{personal}} information management application, replaces Windows Address Book (WAB). It {{is based on a}} new XML based file format where each contact appears as an individual [...]contact file, and features <b>extensibility</b> APIs for integration with other applications. It can store custom information related to contacts, including display pictures. The legacy *.wab format and the open standard *.vcf (vCard) and *.csv (Comma separated values) file formats are also supported.|$|E
2500|$|Windows Vista {{includes}} Internet Information Services (IIS) version 7, {{which has}} been refactored into a modular architecture, with integrated [...]NET <b>extensibility.</b> Instead of a monolithic server which features all services, IIS 7 has a core web server engine, and modules offering specific functionality {{can be added to}} the engine to enable its features. Writing extensions to IIS 7 using ISAPI has been deprecated in favor of the module API. Much of IIS's own functionality is built on this API, and as such, developers will have much more control over a request process than was possible in prior versions.|$|E
2500|$|Interface {{design and}} its {{specification}} {{are concerned with}} assuring that the pieces of a system connect and inter-operate with {{other parts of the}} system and with external systems as necessary. Interface design also includes assuring that system interfaces be able to accept new features, including mechanical, electrical and logical interfaces, including reserved wires, plug-space, command codes and bits in communication protocols. [...] This is known as <b>extensibility.</b> Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) or Human-Machine Interface (HMI) is another aspect of interface design, and is a critical aspect of modern systems engineering. Systems engineering principles are applied in the design of network protocols for local-area networks and wide-area networks.|$|E
2500|$|Berners-Lee {{considered}} HTML an SGML application. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) formally {{defined it}} as such with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification: [...] by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document Type Definition to define the grammar. Many of the HTML text elements {{are found in the}} 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from those used by typesetters to manually format documents. Steven DeRose argues that HTML's use of descriptive markup (and influence of SGML in particular) was {{a major factor in the}} success of the Web, because of the flexibility and <b>extensibility</b> that it enabled. HTML became the main markup language for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser, and is quite likely the most used markup language in the world today.|$|E
2500|$|Visual Studio allows {{developers}} to write extensions for Visual Studio {{to extend its}} capabilities. These extensions [...] "plug into" [...] Visual Studio and extend its functionality. Extensions {{come in the form}} of macros, add-ins, and packages. Macros represent repeatable tasks and actions that developers can record programmatically for saving, replaying, and distributing. Macros, however, cannot implement new commands or create tool windows. They are written using Visual Basic and are not compiled. Add-Ins provide access to the Visual Studio object model and can interact with the IDE tools. Add-Ins can be used to implement new functionality and can add new tool windows. Add-Ins are plugged into the IDE via COM and can be created in any COM-compliant languages. Packages are created using the Visual Studio SDK and provide the highest level of <b>extensibility.</b> They can create designers and other tools, as well as integrate other programming languages. The Visual Studio SDK provides unmanaged APIs as well as a managed API to accomplish these tasks. However, the managed API isn't as comprehensive as the unmanaged one. Extensions are supported in the Standard (and higher) versions of Visual Studio 2005. Express Editions do not support hosting extensions.|$|E
60|$|We now pass {{to another}} {{essential}} part of the theory of the subject. There are two senses in which a country obtains commodities cheaper by foreign trade: in the sense of value and in the sense of cost: (1.) It gets them cheaper in the first sense, by their falling in value relatively to other things; the same quantity of them exchanging, in the country, for a smaller quantity than before of the other produce of the country. To revert to our original figures [of the trade with Germany in cloth and linen]: in England, all consumers of linen obtained, after the trade was opened, seventeen or some greater number of yards for the same quantity of all other things for which they before obtained only fifteen. The degree of cheapness, in this sense of the term, depends on the laws of International Demand, so copiously illustrated in the preceding sections. (2.) But, in the other sense, that of cost, a country gets a commodity cheaper when it obtains a greater quantity of the commodity with the same expenditure of labor and capital. In this sense of the term, cheapness in a great measure depends upon a cause of a different nature: a country gets its imports cheaper, in proportion to the general productiveness of its domestic industry; to the general efficiency of its labor. The labor of one country may be, as a whole, much more efficient than that of another: all or most of the commodities capable of being produced in both may be produced in one at less absolute cost than in the other; which, as we have seen, will not necessarily prevent the two countries from exchanging commodities. The things which the more favored country will import from others are, of course, those in which it is least superior; but, by importing them, it acquires, even in those commodities, the same advantage which it possesses in the articles it gives in exchange for them. What her imports cost to her is a function of two variables: (1) the quantity of her own commodities which she gives for them, and (2) the cost of those commodities. Of these, the last alone depends on the efficiency of her labor; the first depends on the law of international values; that is, on the intensity and <b>extensibility</b> of the foreign demand for her commodities, compared with her demand for foreign commodities.|$|E
50|$|Under {{this form}} of <b>extensibility,</b> a {{software}} system can be extended by modifying the source code, {{and it is the}} most flexible and the least restrictive form. There are two sub-forms of <b>extensibility,</b> open-box <b>extensibility</b> and glass-box <b>extensibility,</b> depending on how changes are applied.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} forms of software extensibility: white-box <b>extensibility,</b> gray-box <b>extensibility,</b> and black-box <b>extensibility,</b> {{which are based on}} what artifacts and the way they are changed.|$|E

50|$|Glass-box <b>extensibility</b> (also called {{architecture}} driven frameworks) {{allows a}} software {{system to be}} extended with available source code, but may not allow the code to be modified. Extensions have {{to be separated from}} the original system {{in a way that the}} original system is not affected. One example of this form of <b>extensibility</b> is object-oriented application frameworks which achieve <b>extensibility</b> typically by using inheritance and dynamic binding.|$|E
50|$|Visual Studio can be {{extended}} in many ways. Books, articles and references generally mix the different aspects and just mention them as <b>extensibility</b> options. Here the different aspects of <b>extensibility</b> are treated separately.|$|E
50|$|<b>Extensibility</b> and {{reusability}} {{have many}} emphasized properties in common, including low coupling, modularity and high cohesion. Software reusability is boosted by <b>extensibility</b> and refers to software elementsâ€™ ability to construct for many different software systems, which {{is motivated by}} the observation of software systems often sharing common elements. Reusability together with <b>extensibility</b> allows a technology {{to be transferred to}} another project with less development and maintenance time, as well as enhanced reliability and consistency.|$|E
