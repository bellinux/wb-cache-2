40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{ballistic}} properties <b>of</b> two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> composites: Kevlar/Carbon laminates and S-Glass/Carbon laminates. Twelve <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> combinations of samples were made including various fibers; various fiber orientations and various target thickness. Air-gun tests were carried out to determine the response of these combinations <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> laminates subject to impact loading. Compared with the test, an explicit finite element (FE) model was built with Pam-crash Code to simulate the impact process. The bullet was considered as a deformable body {{in contact with the}} composite shells. The Ladevèze model was used to describe the unidirectional properties of Carbon plies and Ladevèze fabric model was used to describe the homogeneous properties of the S-glass and Kevlar laminates. The influence of different parameters on the impact behavior <b>of</b> the two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> laminates was considered analytically.

5000|$|Telephone hybrids {{are used}} in {{telephone}} exchanges to convert the 4-wire appearance to the 2-wire last mile connection to the subscriber's telephone. A different <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> is used in telephone handsets to convert the four wires of the transmitter (earpiece) and receiver (microphhone) to the 2-wire line connection. This <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> is more commonly called an induction coil due to its derivation from high-voltage induction coils. It does not produce a high voltage, but like the high-voltage variety, it is a step-up transformer in order to impedance match the low-impedance carbon button transmitter to the higher impedance parts of the system. The simple induction coil later evolved into a form <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> as a sidetone reduction measure, or volume of microphone output that was fed back to the earpiece. Without this, the phone user's own voice would be louder in the earpiece than the other party's. [...] Today, the transformer version <b>of</b> the <b>hybrid</b> {{has been replaced by}} resistor networks and compact IC versions, which use integrated circuit electronics to do the job <b>of</b> the <b>hybrid</b> coil.|$|R

30|$|To {{solve the}} above issue, {{researchers}} have devoted {{their attention to}} pursuing hybrid WOLEDs, which combine fluorescent (F) blue emitters with P green–red/orange emitters to generate white emission as blue F emitters can exhibit long lifetimes and stable colors [11, 12]. To date, two approaches {{had been used to}} create hybrid WOLEDs according to the triplet energy (T 1) of blue F emitters. One is composed of blue fluorophores with triplet energies, which are higher than that of complementary phosphors [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Although this approach can simplify the structures, it is still difficult to synthesize blue F emitters with a high T 1 [20, 21]. In addition, the lifetime of this type <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> WOLED is unsatisfactory. Conversely, hybrid WOLEDs can be fundamental to blue fluorophores with triplet energies, which are lower than that of complementary phosphors. Previously, the latter <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> WOLED had been demonstrated to have the potential to possess many merits, including high efficiency, low-efficiency roll-off, low voltage, stable color, high color rendering index (CRI), and long lifetime [11, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. Therefore, it is beneficial to further enhance the performance <b>of</b> the latter <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>hybrid</b> WOLED because <b>of</b> their peculiar advantages.|$|R
