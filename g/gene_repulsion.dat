40|$|Abstract: Developing {{methods to}} label viruses with {{fluorescent}} moieties has its merits in elucidating viral infection mechanisms and exploring novel antiviral therapeutics. Fluorescent quantum dots (QDs), an emerging probe for biological imaging and medical diagnostics, {{were employed in}} this study to tag retrovirus encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) <b>genes.</b> Electrostatic <b>repulsion</b> forces generated from both negatively charged retrovirus and QDs were neutralized by cationic Polybrene ®, forming colloidal complexes of QDs–virus. By examining the level of EGFP expression in 3 T 3 fibroblast cells treated with QDs-tagged retroviruses for 24 hours, the infectivity of retrovirus incorporated with QDs was shown to be only slightly decreased. Moreover, the imaging of QDs can be detected in the cellular milieu. In summary, the mild method developed here makes QDs-tagged virus a potential imaging probe for direct tracking the infection process and monitoring distribution of viral particles in infected cells...|$|R

This accession also contains the Vf gene. We mapped Vd 3, using SSR and DArT markers, on linkage group 1, {{at a distance of}} 6 cM from Vf <b>gene,</b> but in <b>repulsion</b> phase to Vf. Based on pedigree analysis and resistance tests, it could be deduced that 1980 - 015 - 25 had inherited Vd 3 from the founder D 3. This gene provides resistance to the highly virulent EU-NL- 24 strain of the race 7 of V. inaequalis. This strain has overcome the resistance from both Vf and Vg. However, Vd 3 has been not effective against the majority of other V. inaequalis strains we used in our disease test...|$|R
40|$|Net form net blotch, {{caused by}} the necrotrophic fungal {{pathogen}} Pyrenophora teres f. teres, is a destructive foliar disease of barley {{with the potential to}} cause significant yield loss in major production regions throughout the world. The complexity of the host–parasite genetic interactions in this pathosystem hinders the deployment of effective resistance in barley cultivars, warranting {{a deeper understanding of the}} interactions. Here, we report on the high-resolution mapping of the dominant susceptibility locus near the centromere of chromosome 6 H in the barley cultivars Rika and Kombar, which are putatively targeted by necrotrophic effectors from P. teres f. teres isolates 6 A and 15 A, respectively. Utilization of progeny isolates derived from a cross of P. teres f. teres isolates 6 A × 15 A harboring single major virulence loci (VK 1, VK 2, and VR 2) allowed for the Mendelization of single inverse gene-for-gene interactions in a high-resolution population consisting of 2976 Rika × Kombar recombinant gametes. Brachypodium distachyon synteny was exploited to develop and saturate the susceptibility region with markers, delimiting it to ∼ 0. 24 cM and a partial physical map was constructed. This genetic and physical characterization further resolved the dominant susceptibility locus, designated Spt 1 (susceptibility to P. teres f. teres). The high-resolution mapping and cosegregation of the Spt 1. R and Spt 1. K gene/s indicates tightly linked <b>genes</b> in <b>repulsion</b> or alleles possibly targeted by different necrotrophic effectors. Newly developed barley genomic resources greatly enhance the efficiency of positional cloning efforts in barley, as demonstrated by the Spt 1 fine mapping and physical contig identification reported here...|$|R
40|$|Doubled haploid (DH) {{breeding}} method is a rapid technique to produce homozygous lines from a segregating population. Gametoclonal variation {{has been documented}} in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar derived DH lines. Less is understood about the heritability of gametoclonal variation {{and the presence of}} gametoclonal variation in DH lines derived from crosses when compared to conventional derived single seed descent (SSD) lines. ^ Gametoclonal variation was identified in Chris DH lines for grain volume weight (GVW) and in Kitt DH lines for grain yield and GVW. When these DH lines were used as parents, F 2 progeny bulks did not show altered agronomic performance. Additionally, DH lines were crossed with SSD lines and parent-offspring regression of F 4 lines on F 3 lines showed significant broad sense heritability for low grain yield (H 2 = 0. 21, heritable gametoclonal variation) and earlier days to heading (H 2 = 0. 33, heritable within cultivar variation). ^ Gametoclonal variation may be present in DH lines derived from Pavon 76 x Chris, but its effects could not be separated from linkage and genotype x environments interactions. Population parameter evaluation showed that grain yield associated <b>genes</b> were <b>repulsion</b> phase linked and genotype x environment interactions influenced GVW distributions. For plant height, DH and SSD populations showed bimodal distributions. Gibberellic acid (GA) insensitive tests confirmed the presence of a single plant height gene. DH lines failed to segregate in the expected 1 short: 1 tall ratio. Thus, gametoclonal selection may have occurred during tissue culture process and resulted in higher frequency of short lines. ^ The previous two research projects assessed gametoclonal variation using anther culture derived DH lines. Gynogenetic (maternal) derived DH 2 ̆ 7 s may not have similar gametoclonal variation. Towards this point, factors affecting efficient gynogenetic haploid production were evaluated. Maize pollinated wheat plants were sprayed with either 2, 4 -D or 2, 4 -D + GA hormone solutions and higher numbers of embryos and plants were recovered than when pearl millet was used as a pollen source. Fresh pearl millet pollen was superior to pearl millet pollen stored in an ultra-low temperature freezer. ...|$|R
40|$|Although linkage disequilibrium, {{epistasis}} and inbreeding {{are common}} phenomena in genetic systems that control quantitative traits, theory development and analysis are very complex, {{especially when they}} are considered together. The objective {{of this study is}} to offer additional quantitative genetics theory to define and analyze, in relation to non-inbred cross pollinating populations, components of genotypic variance, heritabilities and predicted gains, assuming linkage disequilibrium and absence of epistasis. The genotypic variance and its components, additive and due to dominance genetic variances, are invariant over the generations only in regard to completely linked genes and to those in equilibrium. When the population is structured in half-sib families, the additive variance in the parents' generation and the genotypic variance in the population can be estimated. When the population is structured in full-sib families, none of the components of genotypic variance can be estimated. The narrow sense heritability level at plant level can be estimated from the parent-offspring or mid parent-offspring regression. When there is dominance, the narrow sense heritability estimate in the in F 2 is biased due to linkage disequilibrium when estimated by the Warner method, but not when estimated by means of the plant F 2 -family F 3 regression. The bias is proportional to the number of pairs of linked genes, without independent assortment, and to the degree of dominance, and tends to be positive when genes in the coupling phase predominate or negative and of higher value when <b>genes</b> in the <b>repulsion</b> phase predominate. Linkage disequilibrium is also cause of bias in estimates of the narrow sense heritabilities at full-sib family mean and at plant within half-sib and full-sib families levels. Generally, the magnitude of the bias is proportional to the number of pairs of genes in disequilibrium and to the frequency of recombining gametes...|$|R
40|$|Wheat scab, {{caused by}} Fusarium graminearum, is a {{destructive}} disease of wheat. Uncertainty about the inheritance of cultivar resistance {{and lack of}} reliable screening techniques have impeded progress in breeding resistant cultivars. In this study, components and inheritance of cultivar resistance were characterized, and factors influencing resistance expression were investigated. Wheat cultivars significantly differ in degree of resistance to scab spread within a spike when tested with different isolates of the fungus in different experiments. When single spikelets were inoculated, spread of scab within a spike was less frequent, later and slower in resistant cultivars than in susceptible cultivars. Measurement of scab spread within a spike is a stable characteristic by which resistance of a cultivar may be assessed. ^ Inheritance of cultivar resistance to spread of scab within a spike was investigated in F 1, F 2, and backcross populations of 11 wheat crosses and in F 5, F 6 and F 7 progenies of Ning 7840 /Clark. One to 3 major genes, depending on the cultivars, with possibly modifying genes conditioned resistance to scab. Additive effects accounted {{for most of the}} genetic variation although dominance and epistasis were detected. With bulked segregant analysis, 10 out of 1120 random decamer primers showed polymorphisms between bulked DNAs from the most resistant and the most susceptible F 6 families of Ning 7840 /Clark. Five polymorphic bands indicated a significant association with 2 resistance <b>genes,</b> either in <b>repulsion</b> or coupling. ^ Scab incidence increased and incubation period decreased as moist periods increased from 0 to 3 nights after inoculation. Scab severity was not affected by moist period during incubation, but affected by temperatures (14, 23, or 30 C) after incubation. Scab spread within a spike was greatest at 23 C. Moisture had no effect on scab spread. Resistant cultivars had consistently low severity under all conditions studied. In addition, both scab incidence and severity significantly increased as inoculum concentration increased. Scab incidence was more affected by moist period after inoculation, inoculum concentration, and inoculation method (injecting spores versus spraying spores) compared to severity. Flowering was the most susceptible stage for infection. ...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{cellular}} and molecular mechanisms governing axon guidance and synaptogenesis {{is a central}} issue in developmental neurobiology. The Drosophila embryonic central nervous system, with its simplicity and genetic accessibility, is an ideal model system to examine these problems. One signaling mechanism by which growth cones respond to guidance factors is the control of tyrosine phosphorylation. Genetic studies in Drosophila have shown that neural receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) are important regulators of motor axon guidance decisions. Chapters 2 and 3 of this thesis describe genetic studies of the RPTP gene DPTP 10 D. Removing DPTP 1 OD and DPTP 69 D causes axon pathfinding errors at the midline and within the longitudinal tracts. These RPTPs genetically interact with <b>genes</b> involved in <b>repulsion</b> from the midline, including Slit, Roundabout and Commissureless. Slit is a midline repulsive signal, while Roundabout is the receptor for Slit. The phosphatases {{are likely to be}} components of signaling pathways downstream of Roundabout. DPTP 10 D is also involved in growth cone guidance decisions in the embryonic neuromuscular system. Phenotypic analyses of RPTP mutant combinations show that DPTPlOD works together with other RPTPs to promote bifurcation of the SNa nerve and allow the ISNb nerve to separate from the common ISN pathway. DPTPlOD, however, has a competitive relationship with the other RPTPs in controlling growth of the ISM These results show that the functional relationships among the four neural RPTPs are complex. At individual choice points, RPTPs can have cooperative, collaborative, or antagonistic functions in controlling guidance. In Chapter 4, I describe an overexpression/misexpression P element screen for new genes involved in axon guidance. This screen allows identification and rapid cloning of genes that cause axon guidance defects when they are overexpressed in all neurons or all muscle fibers. One known axon guidance gene and several novel genes have already been identified in this screen, indicating that it may provide a powerful method to identify new genes that regulate axon guidance and synaptogenesis. There are also three Appendices in the thesis. Two of these are reviews that I coauthored. The third Appendix describes a genetic analysis of the RPTP substrate protein gp 150...|$|R

(some col.) 29 cmThe oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), is {{an important}} agricultural pest in the Pacific Basin and a constant threat to the United States mainland. The extensive economic losses caused by this polyphagous species have been the impetus for research directed towards developing effective non-toxic control measures. A library of genetic markers was constructed by isolating morphological variants {{in a series of}} mutagenesis trials using ethyl methane sulfonate and formaldehyde, and by screening of laboratory and geographic populations. Twenty markers were described, eye color: cherry, copper, gold-grey, Grape, mandarin red, white eye, and yellow eye; eye structure: amethyst, Azure, Furrow, matte, and notched eye; puparium color: melanistic and white puparium; puparium morphology: elongate puparium and robust puparium; and wing structure: crossveinless, curled, notch wing and small wing. The mode of inheritance of marker genes was determined by reciprocal single pair crosses between mutant and wild-type flies. The F 2 progeny numbers were analyzed by chi-square test for goodness of fit to proposed models for autosomal or sex-linkage, recessive or dominant inheritance. All genes were autosomal in nature. Furrow was inherited as a dominant gene, Grape and Azure as incompletely dominant genes and all others were inherited as recessive traits. F 2 progeny numbers from reciprocal crosses with the marker <b>genes</b> in the <b>repulsion</b> configuration were analyzed to assign 15 markers to the five autosomal linkage groups. Map distances were determined from recombinant F 2 progeny numbers from crosses in coupling. Total mapping units (m. u.) were equal to the mean recombination frequency times 100. The linear order of genes in linkage group A was given with mandarin red at position 0, robust puparium at 5. 4 m. u., melanistic at 14. 1 m. u., matte at 26. 7 m. u., and elongate puparium at 30. 2 m. u. Genes in linkage group C were mapped relative to the white puparium locus, amethyst at 23. 4 m. u. from white puparium, gold-grey at 6. 7 m. u. and white eye at 31. 2 m. u. Grape and small wing in linkage group D were 43. 2 m. u. apart. Yellow eye and notched eye were the only markers in linkage groups Band E, respectively.

40|$|Apple (Malus x domestica) {{is one of}} the {{important}} fruit crops of the world. It is mainly cultivated in temperate regions. Apple fruit contains many health beneficial compounds which may {{play an important role in}} reducing cancer cell proliferation and lowering the level of cholesterol. Apple production can suffer from several pests and diseases and among them scab is very important. Apple scab is a fungal disease caused by Venturia inaequalis. The pathogen is a facultative saprophyte that grows during the growing season subcuticularly on the host. Most of the present day high quality apple cultivars are susceptible to apple scab. The crop loss due to apple scab has been amount to more than 70 %. Fruit growers usually spray fungicides 15 times or more in a season to control the scab disease. To reduce the use of chemicals, it is absolute necessary to develop apple varieties with durable scab resistance. Conventional breeding in apple has some drawbacks such as long generation period, genetic drag and the self-incompatible sexual reproduction system. Therefore, stacking of more than one resistance gene by classical introgression breeding is inefficient. Genetic modification is an alternative option to improve the existing scab-susceptible varieties into scab-resistant ones. However, consumer acceptance of transgenic food in Europe is a problem. Therefore, we developed a genetic modification system with cisgenes and intragenes instead of transgenes. Cisgenes are genes from the plant itself or from crossable species with their natural introns and own regulatory elements in normal sense orientation. Intragenes are like cisgenes containing only functional parts of genes from the plant itself or from crossable species, however, these functional parts originate from different genes. All these genes or gene parts are belonging to the normal breeder’s gene pool. Transgenes are synthetic genes or (partly) origination from non-crossable species, like viruses and microorganisms. Transgenes are representing a new gene pool for plant breeding. GMO-regulations have been developed for transgenes. Societal research showed that consumer preference for cisgenic food is higher than for transgenic food. Cisgenic or intragenic plants can be developed by transferring the desired scab resistant genes into the scab-susceptible cultivar through Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Transformation aimed at cisgenesis or intragenesis should be done either without the use of selectable marker genes or by using selection markers first and eliminating them subsequently after selection of transformants. In this thesis almost all steps have been made to come to cisgenic apple plants with resistance to scab disease (chapter 2). Although many scab resistance genes have been identified and mapped, only Vf has been positionally cloned. Vf is a locus with four paralogs namely HcrVf 1 (Homologues of Cladosporium fulvum resistance genes of Vf region), HcrVf 2, HcrVf 3, and HcrVf 4. Only HcrVf 1 and HcrVf 2 are considered as being functional. In conventional breeding Vf inherits as a single locus so it is not possible to study the individual role of HcrVf 1 and HcrVf 2 in conferring resistance against scab using conventionally bred material. The present study was set up to study in depth the roles of HcrVf 1 and HcrVf 2 separately in conferring resistance to apple scab, using A. tumefaciens mediated transformation. Both isolated genes were regulated as cisgenes by their own promoter and terminator sequences. The two cisgenes were used in two different lengths of the 5 ’-upstream sequences, so with a short promoter (SP) and a long promoter (LP) i. e. 312 bp and 1990 bp for HcrVf 1 and 288 bp and 2000 bp for HcrVf 2. HcrVf 1 and HcrVf 2 were also combined with the apple rubisco promoter and terminator into intragenes because these regulatory elements were found to give high expression in plants. The HcrVf 1 and HcrVf 2 cisgenes and intragenes were inserted into the susceptible cv. ‘Gala’, using the marker free system pMF 1. Several apple transformants were selected for further characterization. Micrografting was carried out in order to take the ‘in vitro’ transformants to the greenhouse. This method proved to promote growth better than rooting of ‘in vitro’ transformants. Apple transformant ‘in vitro’ shoots were used as scions and grafted onto the apple seedling rootstocks. Micrografts were ready for further testing 4 to 5 weeks after grafting. At this stage the young leaves were collected for isolation of DNA and RNA. Southern hybridization was performed to check the inserted T-DNA copy number. For this, the selection marker gene nptII was used as a probe. Most of the transformants (17) were found to have a single T-DNA insert and seven transformants showed two T-DNA inserts. Subsequently, HcrVf gene expression in transformed lines was studied through quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) in relation to the natural HcrVf expression in the resistant cv. ‘Santana’. In case of HcrVf 1 transformants, expression by LP was significantly higher than by SP, while in HcrVf 2 transformants no significant difference between SP and LP could be demonstrated. Both HcrVf 1 and HcrVf 2 genes showed highest expression when regulated by the apple rubisco promoter and terminator. Two HcrVf 2 transformants, LPHcrVf 2 - 4 and PMdRbcHcrVf 2 - 12, showed the highest gene expression for the cisgene and intragene situation, respectively. Among HcrVf transformants, no significant correlation was observed between inserted gene copy number and gene expression level (Chapter 3). Micrografted cvs. ‘Santana’ (resistant control containing Vf through classical breeding), ‘Gala’ (susceptible control) and different micrografted apple transformants were tested for scab resistance against V. inaequalis isolate EU-B 05. The top four leaves were Summary 125 used for inoculation with V. inaequalis. Seventeen days after inoculation, the plants were scored for sporulation using a quantitative scale. All the HcrVf 1 transformants showed complete sporulation similar to the level in cv. ‘Gala’, indicating that HcrVf 1 is not giving resistance. On the other hand, 10 out of the 13 HcrVf 2 transformants showed resistance at levels that were statistically similar to cv. ‘Santana’. Two HcrVf 2 transformants, LPHcrVf 2 - 4 and PMdRbcHcrVf 2 - 12, showed the best resistance. A negative correlation between HcrVf 2 gene expression and sporulation was observed i. e. as gene expression increased there was a decrease in the fungal sporulation (Chapter 4). The results obtained by the scab experiment were used to select HcrVf 1 and HcrVf 2 transformants to check the resistance spectrum against different isolates of V. inaequalis. The plants were inoculated with four avirulent isolates of the pathogen and two isolates virulent to the resistant cv. ‘Santana’. The top two leaves were inoculated with fungal spores and the inoculated plants were scored for sporulation 21 days after inoculation. All the HcrVf 1 transformants showed heavy sporulation of all the isolates used and they were behaving like untransformed cv. ‘Gala’. The HcrVf 2 transformants were behaving like cv. ‘Santana’ indicating that the resistance coming from the Vf gene cluster is from HcrVf 2 alone (Chapter 5). In order to increase the durability of resistance against scab, it is desired to stack several resistance genes into apple cultivars either by classical breeding or by genetic modification. To use it in a cisgenic or intragenic approach, new scab resistance genes have to be identified in apple and cloned. In chapter 6 it is described how a novel scab resistance gene, Vd 3, has been identified and genetically mapped in the resistant selection “ 1980 - 015 - 025 ”. In the study we used the F 1 progeny 2000 - 012 that is derived from the crossing between the resistant parent 1980 - 015 - 025 and the susceptible parent 1973 - 001 - 041. Mainly DArT markers were used in this genetic mapping study. Other known markers, such as SSRs, P- 136 (RAPD marker), and Vf 2 ARD (RGA marker), were used for annotation of the linkage groups. The Vd 3 gene has been mapped 1 cM to the south of the Vf <b>gene</b> cluster in <b>repulsion</b> phase on linkage group 1. Paternity tests have indicated that clone 1980 - 015 - 025 has inherited the Vd 3 gene from founder accession D 3. This gene can provide resistance against the virulent isolate EU-NL 24, which can overcome the resistance of Vf and Vg. However, this gene cannot provide resistance against other isolates (Chapter 6). The results described in this thesis are of practical importance. Cisgenesis or intragenesis can be employed to provide multiple gene resistance against scab in apple without linkage drag problems as observed during classical introgression breeding. Our first potential cisgenic scab resistant ‘Gala’ plants with the HcrVf 2 gene are being developed which can be used in regions free of virulent isolates. The cisgenic approach is essential in rapid improving a crop such as apple where it takes many decades through conventional breeding...|$|R
