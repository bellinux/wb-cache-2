40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{by which the}} time-dependent average termination rate coefficient in an emulsion polymerization may be calculated as an appropriate average of the chain-length-dependent termination rate coefficients. The method {{takes advantage of the}} fact that the overall termination rate is dominated by terminations between rapidly moving short radicals and much slower long ones. This termination rate coefficient is suitable for use in the Smith-Ewart equations describing the compartmentalization of radicals in an emulsion polymerization. Rate data in emulsion polymerizations can be quantitatively interpreted if the kinetics fall into one of two categories: zero-one (showing compartmentalization; intraparticle termination is not rate-determining) or pseudo-bulk (no compartmentalization; intraparticle termination is rate-determining). The new method can be used to interpret rate data for systems <b>falling</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> <b>categories</b> and also can be used to find termination rate coefficients from Monte Carlo simulations of termination kinetics. The latter is especially useful for predicting and understanding kinetics in controlled radical polymerizations in disperse media. (C) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|While early {{blogging}} research {{focused on}} top-ranked blogs commenting on public events, recent research confirms that most blogs today concern the personal {{life of the}} blogger. The present article focuses on a particular case of blogs that <b>falls</b> in <b>between</b> <b>these</b> <b>categories.</b> In Sweden, personal blogs written by young women have dominated the ranking lists {{of the most popular}} blogs during recent years. This new phenomenon is approached through an analysis of the characteristics and content of 20 top-ranked blogs authored by young women. Through their popularity, these bloggers have come to introduce commercial and professional aspects of blogging that challenge the conventions of personal blogs. The ar - ticle analyses how the bloggers negotiate these conventions in self-presentations, postings and relations to readers and how they seek to perform a self through the blog that integrates different aspects of blogging. A crucial part of this process is identification with the gender conventions of “ordinary girls”...|$|R
40|$|The bulk of {{economic}} studies on income distribution {{focus on the}} poor and/or on the rich, mostly ignoring those who <b>fall</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> two <b>categories.</b> Research on the polarisation of incomes reverses this perspective, considering the middle-income group as a crucial element of analysis. The exploration of the income dynamics of the middle-income group is particularly relevant {{in the case of}} Italy. There, it has helped explaining the gap between the empirical evidence of stability in the main distributional indices and the worsening of confidence and expectations among Italian households since the 2000 s, already before the crisis. This paper investigates the drivers of mobility of the middle-income group in Italy during the recent recession, with the aim of assessing the changes in the vulnerability of this group to downward mobility. Our findings reveal a general impoverishment of the middle-income group due to the recession and highlight an increasing rigidity of the Italian social structure. Lower entry and exit rates between groups emerge after 2008, possibly due to a growing weakness of the welfare state and the increasing inability of families to cope with unforeseen financial difficulties.

However, the actual behaviour {{is known to}} <b>fall</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> two extreme <b>categories.</b> The use of partial strength connections has been encouraged by studies on the matter. It is proven that it reduces the steel weight in use and thus save the overall construction cost. This project is to analyze the behaviour of trapezoidal web beam profiled to the end plate connection. Comparison between the effect of trapezoidal web beam profiled to end plate connection and stiffener is made to predict the strength, stiffness and rotational capacity of the connections. Previous {{research shows that the}} trapezoidal web beam profiled will minimize the need of stiffeners. Six models have been analyzed in this project by using LUSAS 14. 0 by various type of beam. The dimension of beam is 150 x 200 x 1600 mm whereas for column is 200 x 200 x 1800 mm. The dimension for the end plate stiffener provided is 95 x 95 x 10 mm. Linear analysis is performed to obtain the deformed mesh, maximum stress and strain under axial load. In addition, a non-linear contact analysis is also done to obtain the relationship of the load-deflection at contact surfaces. The results show that the trapezoidal web beam profiled with end plate stiffener and extended end plate connection provide highest strength compared to others and with least deflection under loads...|$|R
