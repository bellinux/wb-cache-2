40|$|This study {{assesses the}} stock return {{performance}} of 131 firms <b>emerging</b> <b>from</b> Chapter 11. Using differing estimates of expected returns, we consistently {{find evidence of}} large, positive excess returns in 200 days of returns following emergence. We also examine the reaction of our sample firms' equity returns to their earnings announcements after emergence from Chapter 11. The positive and significant reactions suggest that our results are driven by the market's expectational errors, not mismeasurement of risk. The results provide an interesting contrast, but not a contradiction, to previous work that has documented poor operating performance for firms <b>emerging</b> <b>from</b> Chapter 11. 1 The Equity Performance of Firms <b>Emerging</b> <b>from</b> Bankruptcy With large corporate bankruptcies being commonplace during the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, {{there has been a}} notable {{increase in the number of}} firms <b>emerging</b> <b>from</b> bankruptcy (Altman (1993)).

5|$|Finally, at 8:00 am., some of Frederick's army <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> the woods, {{with most}} of Generalleutnant Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz's cavalry {{and the rest of}} his artillery; a short time later, the rest of the Prussians <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> the woods, and the Russians {{realized}} it was not a scouting party, but the main army. The Prussians stood ranked for battle, which now began in earnest. Finck's artillery park had been in place since dawn and, at 11:30 am, Moller initiated bombardment of the Russian position from the northern and northeastern ends of the Russian line (now the Russian left). In error, the Russian artillery had faced their batteries to the meadows beyond the Mühlberge, not the ravine, and had to be reset. For 30 minutes, the two sides bombarded each other.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{prior to}} the match itself came the opening {{ceremony}} for the final. The ceremony began with 64 members of the Rustavi Ensemble dance group performing a choreographed routine to {{a variation of the}} UEFA Champions League Anthem. At the culmination of the routine, the players <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> the tunnel, accompanied by Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli singing Il Gladiatore – a song based on Earth from the soundtrack to the film Gladiator – before Bocelli sang supporting vocals to the UEFA Champions League Anthem. Before they <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> their dressing room, manager Pep Guardiola played the Barcelona team a specially commissioned seven-minute film showing their best moments from the season interspersed with clips from the film Gladiator. The film culminated with the late Luciano Pavarotti's version of Nessun Dorma, and it left several of the players in tears. With his players motivated for the game, Guardiola said nothing as they emerged into the tunnel.|$|E
