40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of parity on linear trait types in Guzerá cows using multivariate techniques. Data were collected from 68 purebred Guzera females, young (1 st and 2 nd calving order) and adults (3 rd to 7 th calving order). Measurements were collected using a tape measure, a hypometer, a 40 cm <b>graduated</b> <b>ruler</b> and a 180 ° protractor. PRCOMP procedure of the R program was used for analyzing the main components. The variables related to rump (height, angularity, ileum and ischium length and width), body (length), udder (height of posterior ligament) and milk production were more important to explain the phenotypic variation in Guzerá cattle. Young Guzerá cows had lower body length, narrower rumps, better udder ligaments and lower milk yield than adult cows...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND—To {{be certain}} that the joint space width is {{abnormal}} {{in the case of}} hip joint pain when compared with the contralateral hip requires knowledge of physiological dissymmetry.  AIM OF THE STUDY—To assess interindividual variability and dissymmetry in pelvic radiological joint space width.  METHODS—Pelvic radiographs of subjects without hip joint disease. Measurement with a 0. 1  mm graduated magnifying glass and 0. 5  mm <b>graduated</b> flat <b>ruler</b> at the hip superointermediate site (vertical going through the femoral head centre). After randomisation of the side to measure, analysis of nine groups of 19  plain films by one investigator blind for the result of the contralateral side.  RESULTS—The difference between the left and right hip was plotted against the corresponding mean for all 171  normal subjects This shows the frequency and the limits of the asymmetry at each measurement site. The asymmetry is independent of interindividual variability of the joint space width and greater than the measurement error in most subjects.  CONCLUSION—This study confirms the interindividual variability of hip joint space width, shows the frequency of hip joint space asymmetry and defines its limit.    Keywords: hip joint; joint space width; measuremen...|$|R
40|$|Radio Opaque-Radiolucent Graduated Root-Canal Length Indicating Cone (GRCLIC) {{is a new}} {{innovative}} device being introduced {{for the first time}} in endodontics literature. GRCLIC can present more accurate measurement of the root canal length in conventional radiographs in endodontic and root canal treatment. Like many other dental and medical specialties, endodontics has evolved and changed over the years. The changes that have occurred in the past 10 years, however, have been of great magnitude and profundity. The microscope, ultrasonic units with specially configured tips, superbly accurate microchip computerized apex locators, flexible nickel-titanium files in rotary engines, and greater emphasis on microscopic endodontic surgery have totally changed the way endodontics and endodontic surgery are practiced. Every part of endodontic treatment is controlled by a measurement of the instrument's penetration depth into the canal, while the length is typically determined in millimeters. In this research, GRCLIC was used to enhance the more accurate root canal length determination. GRCLIC was made simply using a thin plastic or optic fiber graduated millimeter-wise with a heavy metal salt. The idea behind the GRCLIC technique was to present a new methodology which is actually a pre-exposure insertion of a simple <b>graduated</b> flexible <b>ruler</b> into the tooth canal instead of classic measurement methods. The main proved advantage of GRCLIC is decreasing mal-measurements which usually lead to treatment failures. GRCLIC enhances the success of endodontics treatment practices...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Advanced {{untreated}} {{dental caries}} can cause pain and discomfort and influence nutrition and growth in children. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate dental caries status (dft) and body mass index (BMI) and their relationship in preschool children in Babol. Materials and Methods: This descriptive-analytical, cross-sectional study was carried out on 600 healthy preschool children aged 3 ‒ 6 years in kindergartens of Babol. After measuring weight with a standard weighing machine (SECA) and height with a standard <b>graduated</b> <b>ruler,</b> BMI was calculated and entered in the curve of standards to determine percentages. In addition, dft was determined according to WHO criteria. Children with known systemic diseases were excluded from the study. Data was analyzed by qui-squared test and ANOVA. Results: Of 600 children, 206 (34. 3 %) children were caries-free. Regarding BMI percentages, 62 % of children were normal, 15. 3 % were overweight and at risk of being overweight, and 22. 7 % were underweight. The relationship between mean of BMI according to d and f was not significant but there was an increase in dental caries with an increase in body weight (p value = 0. 002); however, there was no significant relationship between weight and the number of fillings (p value = 0. 08). Conclusion: Under the limitations of this study, the least and highest number of decay processes and fillings were found in “underweight” and “at risk of overweight” children, respectively. There was a significant increase in caries rate with an increase in the mean of body weight. Key words: BMI, Index, Dental caries, Children, Preschoo...|$|E

Para a extra????o de carv??o mineral a c??u aberto s??o removidas espessas camadas de solo e rochas, o que acarreta uma s??rie de perturba????es visuais, fisiogr??ficas e topogr??ficas. A recomposi????o dessas ??reas, normalmente executada com m??quinas de grande porte, envolve a recoloca????o das camadas anteriormente removidas, constitu??das de diferentes materiais geol??gicos, e sobre estes ?? colocada uma camada denominada de terra vegetal, constitu??da do horizonte superficial do solo proveniente de ??reas pr??-mineradas. Esta composi????o ?? chamada de solo constru??do, apresentando normalmente caracter??sticas muito diferenciadas das do solo original, o que dificulta a revegeta????o, favorecendo, conseq??entemente, a sua degrada????o. Para avaliar a varia????o da taxa de infiltra????o de ??gua foram selecionados dois tipos de solos contru??dos [...] x (SC 1 e SC 2), respectivamente com 2 e 6 anos de idade de constru????o, e um solo natural (SN), localizado pr??ximo aos solos constru??dos, classificado como Argissolo Vermelho Eutr??fico t??pico. Este trabalho foi realizado na ??rea de minera????o de carv??o de Candiota-RS, pertencente ?? Companhia Riograndense de Minera????o-CRM. A taxa de infiltra????o foi avaliada ao longo de uma transe????o de 117 m a cada 3, 0 m de dist??ncia, durante um per??odo m??dio de 7, 5 h, at?? leitura constante, utilizando cilindros de PVC com di??metro interno de 0, 1425 m e altura de 0, 25 m, introduzido 0, 05 m no solo. As leituras foram realizadas utilizando uma r??gua graduada afixada no interior do cilindro ap??s se estabelecer uma carga hidr??ulica de 0, 09 m, mantida aproximadamente constrante ao longo do tempo. Ap??s an??lise dos resultados concluiu-se que: (a) a taxa b??sica de infiltra????o de ??gua nos solos constru??dos ?? baixa a m??dia e superior a do solo natural utilizado como refer??ncia, que ?? muito baixa; (b) a varia????o da taxa b??sica de infiltra????o de ??gua ao longo da transe????o nos solos constru??dos ?? muito alta, com valores extremos variando de muito baixo a muito alto no solo mais recente (SC 1) e de baixo a alto no solo mais antigo (SC 2); enquanto que a do solo natural ?? menor e mais homog??nea; (c) a baixa macroporosidade n??o permitiu estabelecer uma rela????o direta entre sua magnitude e a taxa de infiltra????o; (d) os par??metros de variabilidade espacial da taxa de infiltra????o de ??gua indicam uma fraca depend??ncia espacial, com uma tend??ncia dos solos constru??dos mostrarem uma flutua????o peri??dica da semivari??ncia ao longo da transe????o. The knowledgement of {{the water}} infiltration capacity {{and its relation to}} soil physical properties is of utmost importance to evaluate the soil degradation in mining areas and to propose alternatives to minimize its effects and keep a good soil and water quality. In order to extract the coal, thick layers of soil and rocks are removed, bringing a series of visual, topographic and physiographic disturbances. The reclamation of these areas, usually made with very large and heavy equipment, involves the replacement of the layers previously removed, composed of different geological materials, and the covering with a layer of topsoil, removed from pre-mined areas. This composes a man constructed soil (minesoil), which normally presents characteristics that are very different from the original soil, that makes the revegetation difficult, favoring, consequently, its degradation. In order to evaluate the variation {{of the water}} infiltration rate two different types of minesoils (SC 1 and SC 2) were selected and compared to a native soil located nearby, classified as an alfisol. The water infiltration rate was Evaluated along 117 m transect at 3. 0 m intervals, during an average 7, 5 h period, until constant measurement, using PVC cylinders with 0. 1425 m internal xii diameter and 0. 25 m height, inserted 0. 05 m into the soil. The measurements were done using a <b>graduated</b> <b>ruler</b> fixed in the internal walls of the cylinder interior after the establishment of a hydraulic head of 0. 09 m, maintained constant along the time. After the analysis of the results it was concluded that: (a) the minesoils water infiltration rate is low to medium and higher than the reference native soil, which is very low; (b) the variation of the water infiltration rate along the transect in the minesoils is very high, with extreme values ranging from very low to very high in the recently reclaimed soil (SC 1) and from low to high in the older minesoil (SC 2), while the variation in the native soil is lower and more homogeneous; (c) the low macroporosity did not allow to establish a direct relation between its magnitude and the water infiltration rate; (d) the spatial variability parameters of the water infiltration rate indicate a week spatial dependence, with a trend of the minesoils showing a periodic fluctuation of the semivariance values along the transect...|$|E
