He shows up at Linda's apartment and apologizes for having had her brother killed, but says Linda is partially to blame since she <b>hung</b> <b>around</b> with creeps. This angers Linda, who repeatedly screams that Victor should just go kill himself.|$|E
5|$|The event {{opened with}} a Shop of Horrors match between Abyss and Black Reign, which lasted 10 minutes and 13 seconds. In a Shop of Horrors match, all weapons are legal to use, a wrestler can not be counted out, and {{it can only be}} won by pinfall or submission. James Mitchell {{interfered}} on Reign's behalf during the encounter. Abyss won the contest by pinfall after slamming Reign into the mat with his maneuver, the Black Hole Slam. After the encounter, Abyss grabbed a key that <b>hung</b> <b>around</b> Reign's neck and used it to open a locked building on the stage, which unknowingly was occupied by an unknown wrestler. Reign and the unknown wrestler then proceeded to lock Abyss in the building and push it off the stage.|$|E

25|$|Parnell's {{personal}} {{political views}} remained an enigma. An effective communicator, he was skilfully ambivalent and matched his words depending on circumstances and audience {{though he would}} always first defend constitutionalism on which basis he sought to bring about change, though hampered thereat by the crimes that <b>hung</b> <b>around</b> the Land League and by the opposition of landlords aggravated by attacks on their property.|$|E
25|$|Mickey Dugan, {{better known}} as The Yellow Kid, was a bald, snaggle-toothed barefoot boy who wore an {{oversized}} yellow nightshirt and <b>hung</b> <b>around</b> in a slum alley typical of certain areas of squalor that existed in late 19th-century New York City. Hogan's Alley was filled with equally odd characters, mostly other children. With a goofy grin, the Kid habitually spoke in a ragged, peculiar slang, which was printed on his shirt, a device meant to lampoon advertising billboards.|$|E

Virginia running backs {{combined}} for 151yards on the ground while quarterback Jameel Sewell threw for 223yards with an interception and a touchdown. Despite being huge underdogs, Middle Tennessee <b>hung</b> <b>around</b> the entire game and led by one late due to a blocked extra point. Virginia's decisive scoring drive started from their own 20 with {{less than two minutes}} to go and no time outs.|$|E
25|$|Unusually the MCC were {{scheduled}} to play a minor game immediately before the First Test and travelled 80 miles inland to the large town of Toowoomba. Mike Smith won the toss, fielded and used 10 bowlers in the Queensland Country innings before they declared on 157/4, Gary Jennings making nearly half their runs with his 77. Bob Barber made 56 of his 80 run opening stand with Geoff Boycott, who <b>hung</b> <b>around</b> to make 48 not out in the MCC's 159/3 as they won by seven wickets.|$|E
25|$|The djed pillar {{was often}} used as amulets for {{the living and the}} dead. It was placed as an amulet near the spines of mummified bodies, which was {{supposed}} to ensure the resurrection of the dead, allowing the deceased to live eternally. The Egyptian Book of the Dead lists a spell which when spoken over a gold amulet <b>hung</b> <b>around</b> the mummy's neck, ensures that the mummy would regain use of its spine and be able to sit up. It was also painted onto coffins.|$|E

25|$|Believing Mayne's {{troops to}} {{be a serious}} threat, Victor marched against him. The Loyal Lusitanian Legion {{battalion}} defended the Alcántara Bridge for three hours. Then, the French artillery silenced their guns and a supporting battalion of militia took to its heels. The bridge was mined, but when Mayne ordered the charges to be detonated, its heavy construction withstood the explosion. Victor's infantry then rushed the incompletely demolished span. The French <b>hung</b> <b>around</b> the area for a few days but finally withdrew. The next action was the Battle of Talavera.|$|E

He played with Bobby Byrne in late 1942, then with Charlie Barnet for whom he wrote the classic {{arrangement}} of Skyliner. During his time in New York, he <b>hung</b> <b>around</b> the clubs on 52nd Street, listening to bebop trumpet master Dizzy Gillespie and other musicians, and immersing himself in the new music. Since he didn't {{have the money to}} actually go into the clubs, he would sneak into the kitchen and hang out with the bands, and he got to know many of the great beboppers.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, GSA {{estimated}} {{the costs of}} renovating the Hoover Building at between $850 million to $1.1 billion. Additional problems also became apparent that same year. A piece of the concrete façade came loose and fell onto the sidewalk on busy Pennsylvania Avenue NW. A contractor was hired to remove loose concrete from the exterior. Construction netting was <b>hung</b> <b>around</b> the upper floors to prevent additional pieces of concrete from crashing to the ground. The {{total cost of the}} concrete removal and safety netting installation was $5.9 million. In 2007, an architectural design and planning consultant reported that the cost of these renovations and the disruption to FBI work and staff were not justifiable. The consultant recommended building a new FBI headquarters.|$|E

25|$|India {{showed more}} {{determination}} {{than they had}} done in 5 days of test cricket before this one – 3 of them in an abject 10 wicket humiliation in Mumbai. First the tail wagged (if not in Australian proportions); the last two wickets added 58 runs {{in the company of}} VVS Laxman who batting at No.6 stroked a fluent and graceful 59. Raju scored an important 30 runs, and even Venkatesh Prasad <b>hung</b> <b>around</b> for a while as India chipped away at some of the deficit. Laxman was the last man out, a tad unfairly perhaps – replays showed the ball popped up off his arm – as India were bowled out for 171, 274 in arrears. As expected, Steve Waugh asked India to follow-on.|$|E
25|$|They did, just. Overnight on {{day three}} they were 74 for three, with two wickets taken by Umar Gul, as opener Daren Ganga fell in single {{figures for the}} second time in the match. Nightwatchman Fidel Edwards <b>hung</b> <b>around</b> for an hour in a {{partnership}} of 45 with Lara, and Lara added a further 137, but three wickets fell in the eleven overs before tea on day four, starting with Lara going lbw to part-timer Mohammad Hafeez, who bowled four overs in the game. Shivnarine Chanderpaul was caught off Shahid Nazir with the new ball, and West Indies made 291 after Mohammed's 15; Pakistan chased 13, though they did lose one wicket, opener Hafeez lbw to Corey Collymore for the latter's only wicket in the game.|$|E

The fact is, Barack Obama opted to remain in this minister's company for more than six years after that sermon until partially distancing himself just last week in the heat of a presidential race... What the analysts who are gushing over Obama's sentiments regarding race relations are missing is not only did Obama fail to accomplish the mission he needed to, he didn't even really try. He made no attempt to explain his relationship with Wright and why he <b>hung</b> <b>around</b> a man who habitually offered such hateful rhetoric. Obama instead offered a non-sequitur on race relations.|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} breakfast {{was over and}} the horses had been cared for, {{the rain had stopped}} and the sun was {{breaking}} through the eastern sky.

25|$|The {{battle for}} the Qatrabbul Gate had been a massive victory for the Baghdadis. Of the four {{thousand}} Samarrans stationed {{on the western side}} of the city, two thousand of them had been killed, with several of their heads being <b>hung</b> <b>around</b> Baghdad, and many others were taken prisoner. In Samarra, news of the defeat was met with rioting; many among the populace apparently considered the battle to be a sign of the weakness of al-Mu'tazz's forces. Muhammad b. 'Abdallah, however, refused to follow up on his victory. Rejecting the council of his advisors to press his advantage and pursue the fleeing soldiers, his only order after the battle was to have proclamation of victory drawn up and read in the Jama Mosque of the Round City. Meanwhile, Abu Ahmad's army, which is not mentioned as having participated in the battle that day, remained encamped on the eastern side. As a result, the siege of the city continued.|$|E
25|$|In the Daytona 500, Earnhardt started 9th. His car <b>hung</b> <b>around</b> mid-pack {{for most}} of {{the first quarter of the}} race. After a six-hour and 22-minute red flag, Earnhardt's car came alive, taking the lead with 70 laps remaining. He led 54 of the last 70 laps and he held off Denny Hamlin and Brad Keselowski to win his second Daytona 500, just 10 years after his first one. The {{following}} week at Phoenix, Earnhardt continued his momentum, finishing 2nd to Kevin Harvick. At Las Vegas, Earnhardt gambled on fuel in the remaining 40 laps, but he ran out of gas while leading on the last lap, finishing 2nd to eventual race winner Brad Keselowski. At Bristol, he was strong early, and had a chance to become the first driver since Richard Petty to start a season with four straight Top 2 finishes, until tire problems forced him to make an unscheduled stop, leaving him to finish 24th, four laps down.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Wilder and Chandler had {{intended}} to retain as much of Cain’s original dialogue as possible. It was Chandler who first realized that the dialogue from the novella would not translate well to the screen. Wilder disagreed and was annoyed that Chandler was not putting more of it into the script. To settle it, Wilder hired a couple of contract players from the studio to read passages of Cain’s original dialogue aloud. To Wilder's astonishment, Chandler was right and, in the end, the movie’s cynical and provocative dialogue was more Chandler and Wilder than it was Cain. Chandler also {{did a lot of}} fieldwork while working on the script and took large volumes of notes. By visiting various locations that figured into the film, he was able to bring a sense of realism about Los Angeles that seeped into the script. For example, he <b>hung</b> <b>around</b> Jerry's Market on Melrose Avenue in preparation for the scene where Phyllis and Walter would discreetly meet to plan the murder.|$|E
