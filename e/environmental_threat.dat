5|$|Mycena purpureofusca {{has been}} {{investigated}} for its potential to decolorize industrial dyes. These dyes, used in textile dyeing and printing processes, are difficult to degrade due to their highly structured organic compounds and pose a major <b>environmental</b> <b>threat.</b> The fungus mycelium produces high levels of laccase, an oxidoreductase enzyme. Laccases are widely used in biotechnology and industry due {{to their ability to}} break down various recalcitrant compounds. M.purpureofusca laccase efficiently breaks down Remazol Brilliant Blue R, an industrially important dye that is frequently used as a starting material in the production of polymeric dyes.|$|E

But the country's environmental problems are predominantly the result of abuse and mismanagement of natural resources promoted by political and economic priorities.

25|$|An {{immediate}} <b>environmental</b> <b>threat</b> is the shrinkage {{and drying}} {{out of the}} Lake Urmia located in outskirts of Western Tabriz. The lake has faced a grave crisis since the late 20th century. Water depth reduction, increasing water salinity to saturation level {{and the appearance of}} vast salt fields around the lake, are alarming indications of gradual total desiccation of a unique ecosystem. This occurred due to global warming and ever increasing demands for inadequate fresh water sources in the basin. It is feared in the near future low-lying clouds of airborne salt and minerals may hover over large areas around the lake, posing serious health hazards.|$|E

500|$|Although poor {{management}} of feral horses may pose an ecological and <b>environmental</b> <b>threat</b> {{in some parts}} of Australia, their management is made difficult by issues of feasibility and public concern. [...] Currently, management attempts vary, as feral horses are considered pests in some states, such as South Australia, but not others, including Queensland. There is also controversy over removal of Brumbies from National Parks. The primary argument in favour of the removal of Brumbies is that they impact on fragile ecosystems and damage and destroy endangered native flora and fauna.|$|E
500|$|Currently, Australia has {{at least}} 400,000 horses roaming the continent. [...] It is also {{estimated}} that, during non-drought periods, the feral horse population increases {{at a rate of}} 20 percent per year. Drought conditions and brushfires are natural threats. Despite population numbers, feral horses are generally considered to be a moderate pest. Where they are allowed to damage vegetation and cause erosion, the impact on the environment can be detrimental, and for that reason can be considered a serious <b>environmental</b> <b>threat.</b> [...] However, because they also have cultural and potential economic value, the management of Brumbies presents a complex issue.|$|E

40|$|Towards a transboundary democracy? Political {{responses}} to global <b>environmental</b> <b>threats.</b> Global <b>environmental</b> <b>threats</b> challenge the national {{state and the}} traditional understanding of democracy. Whereas many environmental problems transcend time and space, democracy is bound to the geographical borders of the national state {{as well as to}} its citizens/voters of today. The aim {{of this paper is to}} elaborate in what regards environmental problems challenge democracy and the sovereignty of national states, and critically discuss proposals for political reorganization. By analyzing two cases of global political mobilization against specific <b>environmental</b> <b>threats,</b> the possibilities for global {{responses to}} <b>environmental</b> <b>threats</b> are elucidated. By way of conclusion, the question is raised whether this kind of global alliances and actions implies a fragmentation of our understanding of the world, or if they are promising signs of a development towards global responsibility and cosmopolitan democracy.

[...] In regards to the aquatic environment, it is hard for one to perceive the favorable effects of properly disposing medication. [...] There also exists the plausibility that a person’s behavior will only be affected if there is a severe risk to themselves or humans as opposed to an <b>environmental</b> <b>threat.</b> [...] Even though there are serious threats of pharmaceutical pollution resulting in the feminization of certain fish, they have a lower priority because they are not easily understood or experienced by the general public. [...] In Jonathan P. Bound’s opinion, the provision of information about exactly how to go about disposing unused medication properly in conjunction with risk education may have a more positive and forceful effect.|$|E
2500|$|Leaded {{glass from}} CRTs is reused in car batteries, ammunition, and lead wheel weights, or sold to {{foundries}} as a fluxing agent in processing raw lead ore. Copper, gold, palladium, silver and tin are valuable metals sold to smelters for recycling. Hazardous smoke and gases are captured, contained and treated to mitigate <b>environmental</b> <b>threat.</b> These methods allow for safe reclamation of all valuable computer construction materials. Hewlett-Packard product recycling solutions manager Renee St. Denis describes its process as: [...] "We move them through giant shredders about 30 {{feet tall and}} it shreds everything into pieces {{about the size of}} a quarter. Once your disk drive is shredded into pieces about this big, it's hard to get the data off". An ideal electronic waste recycling plant combines dismantling for component recovery with increased cost-effective processing of bulk electronic waste. Reuse is an alternative option to recycling because it extends the lifespan of a device. Devices still need eventual recycling, but by allowing others to purchase used electronics, recycling can be postponed and value gained from device use.|$|E
