Tonight, we are going to celebrate 400 years of opera with some of my very favourite pieces. I've invited a few of my best friends along, and one or two of my best enemies.

Many central banking innovations, such as interest on reserves and large-scale asset purchases, aren’t adequately treated in standard textbooks. The following is adapted from a presentation made by the president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to the AEA National Conference on Teaching Economics and Research in Economic Education in San Francisco on June 1, 2011. <b>Good</b> <b>evening</b> <b>and</b> <b>welcome</b> to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

As Chairman Bernanke (2006) has noted, economics education is “a critical component of the Federal Reserve’s mission. ” You are the ones who teach this often confounding subject—not only to those who will follow careers in finance and economics, but also to future engineers, artists, and elementary school teachers. For our part, we at the Fed have an enormous stake in economics education. The Fed has often appeared to be clouded in mystery. People often misunderstand our mission and what we do.

As Chairman Bernanke has noted, economics education is “a critical component of the Federal Reserve’s mission. ” 2 You are the ones who teach this often confounding subject—not only to those who will follow careers in finance and economics, but also to future engineers, artists, and elementary school teachers. For our part, we at the Fed have an enormous stake in economics education. The Fed has often appeared to be clouded in mystery. People often misunderstand our mission and what we do. That’s been especially true these past few years. In response to the financial crisis and recession, we deployed an array of new monetary policy and lending tools that were not part of our standard playbook and not found in any textbook. That’s {{one of the reasons why}} we recognize the importance of good communication and transparency, through initiatives such as the Chairman’s periodic press conferences. It is essential that the public have a solid base of knowledge about economics and monetary policy that will allow people to make informed judgments about the Federal Reserve. We depend on educators like you to explain how the Fed works and how our policies affect the economy. We all benefit when the public understands what we do and why, so we are very grateful for the work you do. 1 I want to thank John Fernald, Eric Swanson, and Sam Zuckerman for their assistance in preparing these remarks...|$|E

50|$|Gyngell's media {{career began}} in the record industry, in the mid-1950s, when {{he was hired by}} Australian label Festival Records.

Gyngell is often credited as being the first person to appear on Australian television on 16 September 1956, when he spoke the words, 'Good <b>evening,</b> <b>and</b> <b>welcome</b> to television'. However, many people (possibly several hundred) had already appeared in various television test broadcasts in Australia prior to Gyngell, including performer Alan Rowe, comedy duo 'Ada & Elsie', 'Happy' Hammond, and Graham Kennedy.|$|R
