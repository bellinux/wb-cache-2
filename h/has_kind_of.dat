In an interview conducted the day Nevermind was released, Cobain stated the song was about his friends, explaining, [...] "We still feel as if we're teenagers because we don't follow the guidelines of what's expected of us to be adults [...] It also <b>has</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a teen revolutionary theme." [...] As Cobain did more interviews, he changed his explanation of the song and rarely gave specifics about the song's meaning. When discussing the song in Michael Azerrad's biography , Cobain revealed that he felt a duty [...] "to describe what I felt about my surroundings and my generation and people my age." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] was {{initially}} titled [...] "Lisa the Bully" [...] because {{the original idea}} for the episode, which the writers first pitched, saw Lisa becoming so fed up with Francine's behavior that she attempted to punch Francine. However, she would miss and accidentally punch Principal Skinner instead, resulting in her being sent to juvenile hall where she would make illegal jeans. According to The Simpsons show runner Mike Scully, when the staff members worked on the episode they decided to include a lot of observations they had made about how {{it is like to}} be the new student in school.

500|$|Futterman {{praised the}} return of Chenoweth's {{character}} April Rhodes, and The Wall Street Journal Raymund Flandez said that she [...] "brings such lightness, humor and zaniness that's endearingly button-nose cute". Fallon wrote, [...] "Chenoweth's every sly smirk, eyebrow tick, and note sung—well, that was my week's highlight." [...] Reiter was unenthusiastic: she acknowledged [...] "Chenoweth's amazing pipes", but added [...] "her character, which was thin to start with, <b>has</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> worn out its welcome". The subplot of Will thinking about going to Broadway with April was roundly criticized: both Meghan Brown of The Atlantic and Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle {{said there was no}} tension at all because the viewer knows that he will stay. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen called the entire scenario [...] "ludicrous", made even more so by the highly compressed time frame, and their dress rehearsal [...] "bizarre", criticisms echoed by Brown.|$|E

Every time we get the chance to work together I always try to do something a little different, you know. I hadn't seen her a do a real stripped down, really basic video. I got a taste of it when I did another video with her where she was a guest star, and I got her really stripped down in that but it was still in a Jamaican environment. I just wanted to put her in a really contemporary American environment and bring out the emotions in the song and the bittersweetness of it. Me and her were just vibing off that, and thought it would be really fun to do something just really simple. No visual effects, no gags. The whole strength of the video is on just the honesty of the piece, and that was sort of what we set out to do. Sometimes it's an important visual effect, today it's an important emotion." ...|$|E
500|$|Arnold Schwarzenegger, {{star of the}} {{preceding}} three films in the series, initially remarked that Terminator Salvation was [...] "a great film, I was very excited", but later reversed this position {{and said it was}} [...] "...awful. It tried hard, not that they didn't try, the acting and everything. It missed the boat." [...] Terminator series creator James Cameron considered it an [...] "interesting film" [...] that he [...] "didn't hate as much as I thought I was going to", and praised Sam Worthington's performance, but also said he would not return to the franchise: [...] " [...] <b>has</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> run its course [...] frankly, the soup's already been pissed in by other film makers". He also felt his two films were better than either of the later films. Linda Hamilton, who portrayed Sarah Connor in The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day and lent her voice to Terminator Salvation, wished the film [...] "all the best" [...] but expressed her opinion that the series [...] "was perfect with two films. It was a complete circle, and it was enough in itself. But there will always be those who will try to milk the cow".|$|E

He had visibly vented his anger in the cool down room, when he was seen throwing his podium cap back at Lewis Hamilton after Lewis threw it to him, an incident he later played down as [...] "just our typical games". Sebastian Vettel on the other hand was delighted with his performance, saying that the team had [...] "exceeded all expectations". Newly crowned world champion Hamilton called his third title [...] "the greatest moment of my life", thanking his father and his family for their support. Comparing the title win to his two previous ones, he said: [...] "the last two times were really climactic in the last race. This one still feels just as special if not more special [...] It <b>has</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> topped last year for me – it's equalling Ayrton [...] ". He described equalling his idol's title tally as [...] "a very humbling experience", saying that he felt [...] "very blessed". However, more friction appeared at Mercedes, when Nico Rosberg called Hamilton's manoeuvre at the start [...] "very, very aggressive". Hamilton in turn said of the incident: [...] "It was very close with Nico at the beginning. It wasn't intentional. We both braked deep and there is no grip there and he was turning and I wasn't turning." [...] The team's executive director Toto Wolff said that the incident would need to be discussed, a notion dismissed by Hamilton, who said: [...] "There is no need. Everyone has a right to an opinion but it doesn't matter. I won the race." ...|$|E
