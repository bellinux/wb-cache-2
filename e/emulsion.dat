40|$|Pharmaceutical {{delivery}} systems are developed {{to improve the}} physicochemical properties of therapeutic compounds. <b>Emulsions</b> are one of these drug delivering systems formulated using water, oils and lipids as main ingredients. Extensive data are usually generated on the physical and chemical characteristics of these oil-in-water and lipid <b>emulsions.</b> However, the oxidative tendency of <b>emulsions</b> is often overlooked. Oxidation impacts the overall quality and safety of these pharmaceutical <b>emulsions.</b> Additionally, introducing oxidatively unstable <b>emulsions</b> into biological systems further promotes oxidation in situ. Products of these reactions then continue to pose serious harm to cells and fuel other physiological oxidation reactions. Consequently, the increase of oxidation products leads to oxidative damage to biological systems. Thus, <b>emulsions</b> with lower lipid peroxidation are more stable and will reduce {{the negative effects of}} oxidation in situ. Preventive measures during the formulation of <b>emulsions</b> are important. Many naturally occurring and cost effective substances possess low oxidation tendencies and confer oxidative protection when used in <b>emulsions.</b> Additionally, certain preparatory methods should be employed to reduce or better control lipid peroxidation. Finally, <b>emulsions</b> must be evaluated for their oxidation susceptibility using the various techniques available. Careful attention to the preparation of <b>emulsions</b> and assessment of their oxidative stability will help produce safer <b>emulsions</b> without compromising efficacy...|$|R
5|$|Shoe polish {{consists}} of a waxy colloidal <b>emulsion,</b> a substance composed {{of a number of}} partially immiscible liquids and solids mixed together. It is usually made from ingredients including some or all of naphtha, lanolin, turpentine, wax (often Carnauba wax), gum arabic, ethylene glycol, and if required a colourant, such as carbon black or an azo dye (such as aniline yellow). It typically has a specific gravity of 0.8, is negligibly soluble in water, and is made of between 65 and 77% volatile substances—usually naphtha. The high amount of volatile substances means that the shoe polish will dry out and harden after application, while retaining its shine.|$|E
5|$|The {{photosensitivity}} of {{the silver}} halides allowed for their use in traditional photography, although digital photography, which does not use silver, is now dominant. The photosensitive <b>emulsion</b> used in black-and-white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin, possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity, developing, and tuning. Colour photography requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white silver image couples with a different dye component. The original silver images are bleached off and the silver is then recovered and recycled. Silver nitrate is the starting material in all cases.|$|E

His good reputation in Puerto Rico would survive his stay in the island nation for many years. In 1895, while Betances was living in Paris, the manufacturers of the <b>Emulsión</b> de Scott (a codfish liver oil product that is still sold today, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline in modern times), paid an endorsement fee to Betances to have him appear on advertisements on Spanish language magazines and newspapers all over New York City and the Caribbean, based on his solid reputation as a doctor.|$|E
40|$|Stability against demixing, {{rheology}} and microstructure of <b>emulsions</b> {{that were}} flocculated by depletion or bridging were compared. Flocculation by depletion and bridging was induced by {{addition of the}} polysaccharide carboxy-methylcellulose (CMC) to <b>emulsions</b> that were stabilised by ß-lactoglobulin (ß-lg) at pH 6. 7 and 3. 0, respectively. Depletion-flocculated <b>emulsions</b> generally have a lower initial demixing rates than bridging-flocculated <b>emulsions,</b> but after long times they are compressed to a higher oil content by gravity.

40|$|Food {{products}} often contain {{mixtures of}} incompatible water soluble macromolecules such as proteins and polysaccharides. When two aqueous solutions of incompatible macromolecules are mixed they separate into two phases each enriched {{in one of}} the two macromolecules. Contrary to oil-water (O/W) <b>emulsions,</b> water/water (W/W) <b>emulsions</b> cannot be stabilized by addition of surfactants and in food applications macroscopic phase separation is avoided by gelling one or both phases.

Such particle stabilized <b>emulsions</b> are also known as Pickering <b>emulsions</b> and have been studied extensively for O/W <b>emulsions.</b> Here the literature on particle stabilization of W/W <b>emulsions</b> is reviewed. The behavior of particle stabilized W/W <b>emulsions</b> is found to be quite different from that of O/W <b>emulsions</b> due to the much smaller interfacial tension and the much larger length scale at which the interface expresses itself.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the influence of (i) protein type, (ii) protein content, and (iii) viscosity of o/w <b>emulsions</b> on the deposition and clearance of oral oil coatings and after-feel perception. Oil fraction (moil/cm 2 tongue) and after-feel perception differed considerably between <b>emulsions</b> which do not flocculate under in mouth conditions (Na-caseinate) and <b>emulsions</b> which flocculate under in mouth conditions (lysozyme). The irreversible flocculation of lysozyme stabilized <b>emulsions</b> caused slower oil clearance from the tongue surface compared to <b>emulsions</b> stabilized with Na-caseinate. Protein content had a negative relation with oil fraction for lysozyme stabilized <b>emulsions</b> and no relation for Na-caseinate stabilized <b>emulsions</b> immediately after expectoration. Viscosity differences did not affect oil fraction, although the presence of thickener decreased deposition of oil on tongue.

5|$|Liquid {{fluorocarbons}} {{can hold}} {{large volumes of}} oxygen or carbon dioxide, more so than blood, and have attracted attention for their possible uses in artificial blood and in liquid breathing. Because fluorocarbons do not normally mix with water, they must be mixed into emulsions (small droplets of perfluorocarbon suspended in water) {{to be used as}} blood. One such product, Oxycyte, has been through initial clinical trials. These substances can aid endurance athletes and are banned from sports; one cyclist's near death in 1998 prompted an investigation into their abuse. Applications of pure perfluorocarbon liquid breathing (which uses pure perfluorocarbon liquid, not a water <b>emulsion)</b> include assisting burn victims and premature babies with deficient lungs.

5|$|The {{conventions}} of Moonlight are based, in part, on a unique mythology. Some {{parts of the}} mythology that are common include a sire, that is the vampire who turns a human into a vampire; though in the show the sire must teach him or her how to live as one. A vampire's bite {{is not enough to}} turn a human into a vampire; the human, when near death, must drink the sire's blood or have vampire blood in his or her system at the moment of death. The process of vampirization also affects their genetics, causing their DNA to be fundamentally altered to suit their bodies' new state. This makes genetic testing between vampires and their human relatives impossible unless the vampire has a sample of their own human DNA from before they were turned, such as a lock of hair. They must consume human blood to survive. They also develop psychic powers and can glimpse the future and the past. This ability, along with their night vision, is an extension of their heightened senses. Daylight does not kill vampires, but does make them progressively weaker. Silver and fire are toxic, whereas garlic, holy water and crucifixes are useless. A vampire's image cannot be captured with analogue cameras containing silver <b>emulsion</b> in the film; digital cameras are able to capture an image because they do not use silver <b>emulsion.</b> Though undead, vampires have a pulse, are not cold blooded (but still don't produce body heat as seen in episode 11 so as heat signature cameras won't see them), and cannot turn into a bat. The best ways to kill them are by decapitation or burning; a stake through the heart is painful but only causes paralysis. Moonlight vampires have many of the preternatural abilities as described in vampire mythology; they have superhuman strength and speed, they heal rapidly from any wound, they can defy gravity to a limited degree to perform parkour feats, their bite has hypnotic effects on weak-minded humans, and they are immortal. Their powers increase as they get older. Their blood has drug-like affects when consumed by humans; causing euphoria and temporarily heightened senses.|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} in the {{manufacture}} of a typical shoe polish is the melting of the wax with the highest melting point in an electric heater. Following this, all other waxes are added, usually by descending order of melting point. While this wax is held at a constant temperature, the emulsion—a mixture of the various oils and, if used, fats, is then heated separately, at around 85°C. The heated <b>emulsion</b> is then added to the waxes, along with distilled water. When the mixture reaches around 80°C, turpentine oil is added. This mixture is then mixed and continually stirred for half an hour. Dyes are added and mixed in turpentine oil if it is not a neutral polish. The mixed mass is reduced slowly to 50°C, and as its viscosity increases, it is poured through a closed funnel into a cooling chamber. The poured mass is allowed to settle slowly, providing uniform distribution. The process is considered straightforward and the required equipment is relatively easy to acquire. The cost of establishing shoe polish manufacturing facilities has been estimated at around $600,000 (as of 2005).|$|E

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of the present PhD thesis was to study some factors related to the choice of {{emulsifier}} (whey protein isolate or sodium caseinate) concentration, oil-phase volume fractions (10 - 50 %) and homogenization conditions (100 - 300 MPa) that could influence physical stability and lipid oxidation in nano/submicron oil-in-water <b>emulsions</b> by using a rotor-startor system (colloidal mill, CM, at 5000 rpm for 5 min) for obtaining the coarse <b>emulsions</b> and stabilized by ultra high-pressure homogenization (UHPH), in comparison to conventional homogenization (CH, 15 MPa). <b>Emulsions</b> were characterized for their physical properties (droplet size distribution, microstructure, surface protein concentration, emulsifying stability against creaming and coalescence, and viscosity) and oxidative stability (hydroperoxide content and TBARs) under light (2000 lux/m 2 for 10 days). The first study focused on using whey protein isolate (WPI) as emulsifier in different concentrations (1, 2 and 4 %) with a fixed oil concentration (20 %) of sunflower and olive oils (3 : 1). UHPH produced <b>emulsions</b> with lipid particles of small size in the sub-micron range (100 - 200 nm) and low surface protein with unimodal distribution in <b>emulsions</b> treated at 200 MPa using whey proteins at 4 %. Long term physical stability against creaming and coalescence was observed in UHPH <b>emulsions,</b> compared to those obtained by CM and CH. Oxidative stability of <b>emulsions</b> was also improved by UHPH compared to CM and CH, especially when 100 MPa was applied. All <b>emulsions</b> exhibited Newtonian behavior (n ≈ 1). These results led us to use the best conditions obtained in the previous work (4 % of protein concentration and pressure treatments of 100 and 200 MPa) to study the physical and oxidative stability of <b>emulsions</b> containing different oil-phase volume fractions (10, 30 and 50 %). Increasing the oil concentration from 10 to 50 %, in general, increased the particle size, decreased the surface protein concentration and resulted in {{a high degree of}} flocculation and coalescence, especially in <b>emulsions</b> treated at 200 MPa. All UHPH <b>emulsions,</b> except those treated at 100 MPa containing 10 % oil, and CH <b>emulsions</b> with 50 % oil displayed an excellent stability vs. creaming during storage at ambient temperature. The lowest oxidation rate was observed in UHPH <b>emulsions,</b> especially those containing 30 % oil. The third study was conducted on using sodium caseinate (SC) as emulsifier in different concentrations (1, 3 and 5 %) with a fixed oil concentration (20 %) of sunflower and olive oils (3 : 1). UHPH <b>emulsions</b> containing 1 % protein presented a high particle size (especially in <b>emulsions</b> treated at 100 MPa) but increasing the protein content to 3 and 5 % in UHPH <b>emulsions</b> reduced the particle size, and tended to change the rheological behaviour from Newtonian to shear thinning, improving the creaming and oxidative stabilities of <b>emulsions.</b> From the previous study, the best droplet breakdown, physical and oxidative stability were obtained with pressures in the range of 200 and 300 MPa and sodium caseinate (5 %). Therefore, the objective of the last study was to evaluating the <b>emulsions</b> containing different oil-phase volume fractions (10, 20, 30 and 50 %) treated by UHPH in the conditions above mentioned, in comparison to CH <b>emulsions</b> containing 1 and 5 % SC. Increasing the oil content to 50 % tended to produce <b>emulsions</b> with a gel structure such as a mayonnaise type product so, {{the results of this study}} focused only on <b>emulsions</b> containing 10, 20 and 30 % oil. CM and CH <b>emulsions</b> containing 1 % SC and different oil contents (10, 20 and 30 %), exhibited a Newtonian flow behavior with a slow creaming rate, whereas the oxidation rate was faster in these <b>emulsions.</b> On the other hand, high degree of flocculation with a shear thinning behavior, higher creaming rates, but low oxidation rates were observed in CH <b>emulsions</b> containing 5 %. UHPH-treated <b>emulsions</b> containing high oil contents (20 and 30 %) exhibited excellent creaming stability, and with a shear thinning rheological behavior only in <b>emulsions</b> containing 30 % oil. UHPH produced stable <b>emulsions</b> against oxidation, especially when high oil contents (20 - 30 %) were used. Increasing the oil concentration from 10 to 30 %, in general, resulted in an increase in the oxidative stability in all <b>emulsions,</b> except in CH <b>emulsions</b> containing 1 % of SC. <b>Emulsions</b> produced by both whey protein (4 %) and caseinate (5 %), and treated by UHPH have a good physical stability to flocculation, coalescence and creaming and also high stability to lipid oxidation, opening a wide range of opportunities in the formulation of <b>emulsions</b> containing bioactive components with lipid nature...|$|R

Oil-in-water <b>emulsions</b> were prepared to optimize oil content and surfactant concentration by investigating their effects on pour point, rheology and stability of <b>emulsions.</b> Effects of droplet size distribution in <b>emulsions</b> on their viscosity and stability were also examined along with discussion of interfacial properties, IFT and zeta potentials of <b>emulsions</b> at various surfactant concentrations.|$|R

UHPH produced <b>emulsions</b> containing lipid droplets in the sub-micron range (100 – 200 nm) and with low protein concentrations on droplet surfaces. Droplet size (d 3. 2, µm) was increased in CH and UHPH <b>emulsions</b> by increasing the oil concentration. CM <b>emulsions</b> exhibited Newtonian flow behaviour at all oil concentrations studied; however, the rheological behaviour of CH and UHPH <b>emulsions</b> varied from Newtonian flow (n ≈ 1) to shear-thinning (n ˂ 1) and thixotropic behaviour in <b>emulsions</b> containing 50 % oil. This was confirmed by the non-significant differences in the d 4. 3 (µm) value between {{the top and bottom}} of <b>emulsions</b> in tubes left at room temperature for nine days and also by a low migration velocity measured with a Turbiscan LAB instrument. UHPH <b>emulsions</b> showed significantly lower oxidation rates during 10 days storage in comparison to CM and CH <b>emulsions</b> as confirmed by hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). UHPH <b>emulsions</b> treated at 100 MPa were less oxidized than those treated at 200 MPa. The results from this study suggest that UHPH treatment generates <b>emulsions</b> that have a higher stability to creaming and lipid oxidation compared to colloid mill and conventional treatments...|$|R
