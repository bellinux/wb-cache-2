50|$|The first implantable arrays were {{microwire}} arrays {{developed in}} the 1950s. The first experiment involving {{the use of an}} array of planar electrodes to record from cultured cells was conducted in 1972 by C.A. Thomas, Jr. and his colleagues. The experimental setup used a 2 x 15 array of <b>gold</b> electrodes <b>plated</b> <b>with</b> <b>platinum</b> black, each spaced 100 µm apart from each other. Myocytes harvested from embryonic chicks were dissociated and cultured onto the MEAs, and signals up to 1 mV high in amplitude were recorded. MEAs were constructed and used to explore the electrophysiology of snail ganglia independently by Guenter Gross {{and his colleagues at the}} Center for Network Neuroscience in 1977 without prior knowledge of Thomas and his colleagues' work. In 1982, Gross observed spontaneous electrophysiological activity from dissociated spinal cord neurons, and found that activity was very dependent on temperature. Below about 30˚C signal amplitudes decrease rapidly to relatively small value at room temperature.|$|R

50|$|Claudius Ash {{followed}} his father into {{the profession of}} silversmithing and goldsmithing in the firm of Ash & Sons, 64 St James’s Street, Westminster. In about 1820 {{he was asked to}} apply his craftsmanship to making a set of dentures. Up to this time, the majority of false teeth were made from hippopotamus or walrus ivory that was prone to discolouring, or from human teeth extracted from dead bodies, including battlefield casualties (thus known as ‘Waterloo teeth’). Ash’s teeth, made of porcelain mounted on <b>gold</b> <b>plates,</b> <b>with</b> <b>gold</b> springs and swivels, were considered superior both aesthetically and functionally and laid the foundation of his new enterprise as Britain’s foremost manufacturer of dentures and dental appliances. Originally based in Broad Street (now Broadwick Street), London, the business expanded rapidly and by the mid-nineteenth century Claudius Ash dentures and dental equipment dominated the European market.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a tube-shaped ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) actuator with sectored elec-trodes and an integrated resistive strain-based displacement sen-sor. Tube or cylindrical shaped IPMC actuators, with the ability to provide multiple degrees-of-freedom motion, can be used to create active catheter biomedical devices and novel bio-inspired propulsion mechanisms for underwater autonomous systems. An experimental tube-shaped IPMC actuator is manufactured from a 40 -mm long Nafion polymer tube with inner diameter of 1. 3 mm and outer diameter of 1. 6 mm. The outer surface of the tube-shaped structure is <b>plated</b> <b>with</b> <b>platinum</b> metal via an electroless plating process. The platinum electrode on the tube’s outer sur-face is sectored into four isolated electrodes using a simple sur-face milling technique. A custom-designed strain sensor com-prised of 50 AWG ni-chrome wire is developed and attached to the tube’s surface to sense the bending motion of the tube actua-tor. The integrated sensor is low cost and practical, and it avoids the need for bulky external sensors such as lasers for measuring deflection and feedback control. Preliminary experimental re-sults are presented to demonstrate the performance of the IPMC tube actuator and integrated displacement sensor. ...|$|R
