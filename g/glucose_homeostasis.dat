25|$|In animals, {{this is a}} rate-controlling step of gluconeogenesis, {{the process}} by which cells {{synthesize}} glucose from metabolic precursors. The blood glucose level is maintained within well-defined limits in part due to precise regulation of PEPCK gene expression. To emphasize the importance of PEPCK in <b>glucose</b> <b>homeostasis,</b> over expression of this enzyme in mice results in symptoms of type II diabetes mellitus, by far {{the most common form of}} diabetes in humans. Due to the importance of blood <b>glucose</b> <b>homeostasis,</b> a number of hormones regulate a set of genes (including PEPCK) in the liver that modulate the rate of glucose synthesis.|$|E
25|$|PEPCK-C catalyzes an {{irreversible}} step of gluconeogenesis, {{the process}} whereby glucose is synthesized. The enzyme has therefore been {{thought to be}} essential in <b>glucose</b> <b>homeostasis,</b> as evidenced by laboratory mice that contracted diabetes mellitus type 2 {{as a result of}} the overexpression of PEPCK-C.|$|E
25|$|HMG-CoA reductase {{is active}} when blood glucose is high. The basic {{functions}} of insulin and glucagon are to maintain <b>glucose</b> <b>homeostasis.</b> Thus, in controlling blood sugar levels, they indirectly affect {{the activity of}} HMG-CoA reductase, but a decrease in activity of the enzyme is caused by an AMP-activated protein kinase, which responds {{to an increase in}} AMP concentration, and also to leptin (see 4.4, Phosphorylation of reductase).|$|E

25|$|While all neurons use glucose for fuel, certain glucose-sensing neurons {{alter their}} firing rates in {{response}} to rising or falling levels of glucose. These glucose-sensing neurons are concentrated primarily in the ventromedial nucleus and arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, which regulate many aspects of <b>glucose</b> <b>homeostasis</b> (especially the response to hypoglycemia), fuel utilization, satiety and appetite, and weight maintenance. These neurons are most sensitive to glucose changes in the 0.5–3.5mmol/L glucose range.|$|E
25|$|The insulin {{receptor}} (IR) is a transmembrane receptor that {{is activated}} by insulin, IGF-I, IGF-II and {{belongs to the}} large class of tyrosine kinase receptors. Metabolically, the insulin receptor {{plays a key role}} in the regulation of <b>glucose</b> <b>homeostasis,</b> a functional process that under degenerate conditions may result in a range of clinical manifestations including diabetes and cancer. Biochemically, the insulin receptor is encoded by a single gene , from which alternate splicing during transcription results in either IR-A or IR-B isoforms. Downstream post-translational events of either isoform result in the formation of a proteolytically cleaved α and β subunit, which upon combination are ultimately capable of homo or hetero-dimerisation to produce the ≈320 kDa disulfide-linked transmembrane insulin receptor.|$|E
25|$|Normal <b>glucose</b> <b>homeostasis</b> is {{controlled}} by three interrelated processes. These processes include gluconeogenesis (glucose production that occurs in the liver), uptake and utilization of glucose by the peripheral tissues of the body, and insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta islet cells. The presence of glucose in the bloodstream triggers the production and release of insulin from the pancreas' beta islet cells. The main function of insulin {{is to increase the}} rate of transport of glucose from the bloodstream into certain cells of the body, such as striated muscles, fibroblasts, and fat cells. It also is necessary for transport of amino acids, glycogen formation in the liver and skeletal muscles, triglyceride formation from glucose, nucleic acid synthesis, and protein synthesis.|$|E

25|$|This {{technique}} has been clinically researched since the mid-2000s. It involves the implantation of a duodenal-jejunal bypass liner between {{the beginning of}} the duodenum (first portion of the small intestine from the stomach) and the mid-jejunum (the secondary stage of the small intestine). This prevents the partially digested food from entering the first and initial part of the secondary stage of the small intestine, mimicking the effects of the biliopancreatic portion of Roux en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. Despite a handful of serious adverse events such as gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal pain, and device migration — all resolved with device removal — initial clinical trials have produced promising results in the treatment's ability to improve weight loss and <b>glucose</b> <b>homeostasis</b> outcomes.|$|E
25|$|In {{pancreatic}} β-cells, cAMP signaling, {{which can}} be activated by various extracellular stimuli including hormonal and neural inputs primarily through Gs-coupled receptors, is of importance for normal regulation of insulin secretion to maintain <b>glucose</b> <b>homeostasis.</b> Activation of cAMP signaling amplifies insulin secretion by Epac2-dependent as well as PKA-dependent pathways. Epac2-Rap1 signaling is critical to promote exocytosis of insulin-containing vesicles from the readily releasable pool. In Epac2-mediated exocytosis of insulin granules, Epac2 interacts with Rim2, which is a scaffold protein localized in both plasma membrane and insulin granules, and determines the docking and priming states of exocytosis. In addition, piccolo, a possible Ca2+ sensor protein, interacts with the Epac2-Rim2 complex to regulate cAMP-induced insulin secretion. It is suggested that phospholipase C-ε (PLC-ε), one of the effector proteins of Rap, regulates intracellular Ca2+ dynamics by altering the activities of ion channels such as ATP-sensitive potassium channel, ryanodine receptor, and IP3 receptor.|$|E

2500|$|The insulin receptor's {{endogenous}} ligands include insulin, IGF-I and IGF-II. The binding of ligand to the α-chains of the IR ectodomain induces {{structural changes}} within the receptor leading to autophosphorylation of various tyrosine residues within the intracellular TK {{domain of the}} β-chain. These changes facilitate the recruitment of specific adapter proteins such as the insulin receptor substrate proteins (IRS) in addition to SH2-B (Src Homology 2 - B [...] ), APS and protein phosphatases, such as PTP1B, eventually promoting downstream processes involving blood <b>glucose</b> <b>homeostasis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Beta {{cells are}} {{sensitive}} to glucose concentrations, also known as blood sugar levels. When the glucose level is high, the beta cells secrete insulin into the blood; when glucose levels are low, secretion of insulin is inhibited. [...] Their neighboring alpha cells, by taking their cues from the beta cells, secrete glucagon into the blood in the opposite manner: increased secretion when blood glucose is low, and decreased secretion when glucose concentrations are high. Glucagon, through stimulating the liver to release glucose by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, has the opposite effect of insulin. The secretion of insulin and glucagon into the blood {{in response to the}} blood glucose concentration is the primary mechanism of <b>glucose</b> <b>homeostasis.</b>|$|E

40|$|SummaryImbalances in <b>glucose</b> {{and energy}} <b>homeostasis</b> {{are at the}} core of the {{worldwide}} epidemic of obesity and diabetes. Here, we illustrate an important role of the TGF-β/Smad 3 signaling pathway in regulating <b>glucose</b> and energy <b>homeostasis.</b> Smad 3 -deficient mice are protected from diet-induced obesity and diabetes. Interestingly, the metabolic protection is accompanied by Smad 3 −/− white adipose tissue acquiring the bioenergetic and gene expression profile of brown fat/skeletal muscle. Smad 3 −/− adipocytes demonstrate a marked increase in mitochondrial biogenesis, with a corresponding increase in basal respiration, and Smad 3 acts as a repressor of PGC- 1 α expression. We observe significant correlation between TGF-β 1 levels and adiposity in rodents and humans. Further, systemic blockade of TGF-β signaling protects mice from obesity, diabetes, and hepatic steatosis. Together, these results demonstrate that TGF-β signaling regulates glucose tolerance and energy homeostasis and suggest that modulation of TGF-β activity might be an effective treatment strategy for obesity and diabetes...|$|R

40|$|Design and Methods—Skeletal muscle {{adipose tissue}} (AT) {{infiltration}} (myosteatosis) increases with aging and {{may contribute to}} the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). It remains unclear if myosteatosis is associated to <b>glucose</b> and insulin <b>homeostasis</b> independent of total and central adiposity. We evaluated the association between intermuscular AT (IMAT) in the abdominal skeletal muscles (total, paraspinal and psoas) and fasting serum <b>glucose,</b> insulin, and <b>homeostasis</b> model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in 393 non-diabetic Caucasian men aged 65 +.
