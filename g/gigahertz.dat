5|$|Many {{methods of}} {{decreasing}} the response time of ALFs have been developed. Even {{in the late}} 1980s, certain gases were used to catalyze the decay of the electrons of the vapor cell. In 1989, Eric Korevaar had developed his Fast ALF design which detected emitted fluorescence without photosensitive plates. With such methods employed, <b>gigahertz</b> frequencies are easily attainable.|$|E
25|$|The same {{principle}} {{is critical in}} all radio transmitters and receivers, and in computers where it creates a clock pulse. Both of these usually use a frequency multiplier to reach <b>gigahertz</b> ranges.|$|E
25|$|The fastest ever {{integrated}} circuit is announced by DARPA, achieving one terahertz (1012 Hz), or a trillion cycles per second. This is 150 billion cycles {{faster than the}} existing world record of 850 <b>gigahertz</b> set in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound {{is sound}} waves with {{frequencies}} {{higher than the}} upper audible limit of human hearing. Ultrasound {{is no different from}} 'normal' (audible) sound in its physical properties, except in that humans cannot hear it. Ultrasound devices operate with frequencies from 20 kHz up to several <b>gigahertz.</b>|$|E
25|$|Diathermy {{is used by}} some as {{a synonym}} for {{electrosurgery}} but in other contexts diathermy means dielectric heating, produced by rotation of molecular dipoles in a high frequency electromagnetic field. This effect is most widely used in microwave ovens or some tissue ablative devices which operate at <b>gigahertz</b> frequencies. Lower frequencies, allowing for deeper penetration, are used in industrial processes.|$|E
25|$|When first {{demonstrated}} in 2000, the composite material (NIM) {{was limited to}} transmitting microwave radiation at frequencies of 4 to 7 <b>gigahertz</b> (4.28–7.49cm wavelengths). This range is between the frequency of household microwave ovens (~2.45GHz, 12.23cm) and military radars (~10GHz, 3cm). At demonstrated frequencies, pulses of electromagnetic radiation moving through the material in one direction are composed of constituent waves moving in the opposite direction.|$|E
25|$|The saturnian {{radiation}} belts {{are generally}} much weaker {{than those of}} Jupiter and do not emit much microwave radiation (with frequency of a few <b>Gigahertz).</b> Estimates shows that their decimetric radio emissions (DIM) {{would be impossible to}} detect from the Earth. Nevertherless the high energy particles cause weathering of the surfaces of the icy moons and sputter water, water products and oxygen from them.|$|E
25|$|Although QCA solves {{most of the}} {{limitations}} of CMOS technology, it also brings its own. Research suggests that intrinsic switching time of a QCA cell is at best in the order of terahertz. However, the actual speed may be much lower, in the order of megahertz for solid state QCA and <b>gigahertz</b> for molecular QCA, due to the proper quasi-adiabatic clock switching frequency setting.|$|E
25|$|Independently, Charles Hard Townes, James P. Gordon, and H. J. Zeiger {{built the}} first ammonia maser at Columbia University in 1953. This device used stimulated {{emission}} in a stream of energized ammonia molecules to produce amplification of microwaves at a frequency of about 24.0 <b>gigahertz.</b> Townes later worked with Arthur L. Schawlow to describe {{the principle of the}} optical maser, or laser, of which Theodore H. Maiman created the first working model in 1960.|$|E
25|$|They {{dispensed}} with split-ring-resonators and instead used {{a network of}} L–C loaded transmission lines. In the metamaterial literature this became known as artificial transmission-line media. At that time it had the added advantage of being more compact than a unit made of wires and split ring resonators. The network was both scalable (from the megahertz to the tens of <b>gigahertz</b> range) and tunable. It also includes a method for focusing the wavelengths of interest.|$|E
25|$|One {{can think}} of MEMS {{resonators}} as small bells that ring at high frequencies. Small bells ring at higher frequencies than large bells, and since MEMS resonators are small they can ring at high frequencies. Common bells are meters down to centimeters across and ring at hundreds of hertz to kilohertz; MEMS resonators are {{a tenth of a}} millimeter across and ring at tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz. MEMS resonators have operated at over a <b>gigahertz.</b>|$|E
25|$|Athlon is {{the brand}} name applied {{to a series of}} x86-compatible {{microprocessors}} designed and manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). The original Athlon (now called Athlon Classic) was the first seventh-generation x86 processor. The original Athlon was the first desktop processor to reach speeds of one <b>gigahertz</b> (GHz). AMD has continued using the Athlon name with the Athlon 64, an eighth-generation processor featuring x86-64 (later renamed AMD64) architecture, and the Athlon II. AMD also uses the Athlon name for some of its series of APUs targeting the Socket AM1 desktop SoC architecture.|$|E
25|$|Phase-locked loops {{are widely}} {{employed}} in radio, telecommunications, {{computers and other}} electronic applications. They {{can be used to}} demodulate a signal, recover a signal from a noisy communication channel, generate a stable frequency at multiples of an input frequency (frequency synthesis), or distribute precisely timed clock pulses in digital logic circuits such as microprocessors. Since a single integrated circuit can provide a complete phase-locked-loop building block, the technique is widely used in modern electronic devices, with output frequencies from a fraction of a hertz up to many <b>gigahertz.</b>|$|E

25|$|Sirius offers car {{radios and}} home {{entertainment}} systems, {{as well as}} car and home kits for portable use. The Sirius receiver includes the antenna module and the receiver module. The antenna module picks up signals from the ground repeaters or the satellite, amplifies the signal and filters out any interference. The signal is then {{passed on to the}} receiver module. Inside the receiver module is a chipset consisting of eight chips. The chipset converts the signals from 2.3 <b>gigahertz</b> (GHz) to a lower intermediate frequency. Sirius also offers an adapter that allows conventional car radios to receive satellite signals.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory for}} this kind of {{avalanche}} transistor is described completely in the paper , which also shows that this semiconductor device structure is well suited for microwave power amplification. It can deliver several watts of radio frequency power at a frequency of several <b>gigahertz</b> and it also has a control terminal, the base. However, it is not widely used since it requires voltages exceeding 200 volts to work properly, while gallium arsenide or other compound semiconductor FETs deliver a similar performance while being easier to work with. A similar device structure, proposed more or less in the same period in the paper , was the IMPISTOR, being a transistor with IMPATT collector-base junction.|$|E
500|$|In supercomputers, {{the speed}} of light imposes a limit on how quickly data can be sent between {{processor}}s. If a processor operates at 1 <b>gigahertz,</b> a signal can only travel a maximum of about [...] in a single cycle. Processors must therefore be placed close to each other to minimize communication latencies; this can cause difficulty with cooling. If clock frequencies continue to increase, {{the speed of}} light will eventually become a limiting factor for the internal design of single chips.|$|E

The facility is intended to provide students and faculty access to RF technologies widely used in spaceflight operations, and will include satellite and spacecraft tracking.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{electronic}} systems include processors of various sorts that operate at hundreds of megahertz. [...] Typically, the clocks supplied to these processors come from clock generator PLLs, which multiply a lower-frequency reference clock (usually 50 or 100nbsp&MHz) {{up to the}} operating frequency of the processor. [...] The multiplication factor can be quite large {{in cases where the}} operating frequency is multiple <b>gigahertz</b> and the reference crystal is just tens or hundreds of megahertz.|$|E
2500|$|... 2.4 <b>gigahertz</b> Bluetooth {{connectivity}} is {{the most}} recent innovation in wireless interfacing for hearing instruments to audio sources such as TV streamers or Bluetooth enabled mobile phones. Current hearing aids generally do not stream directly via Bluetooth but rather do so through a secondary streaming device (usually worn around the neck or in a pocket), this bluetooth enabled secondary device then streams wirelessly to the hearing aid but {{can only do so}} over a short distance. This technology can be applied to ready-to-wear devices (BTE, Mini BTE, RIE, etc.) or to custom made devices that fit directly into the ear.|$|E
2500|$|In 1960, Cornell University {{astronomer}} Frank Drake {{performed the}} first modern SETI experiment, named [...] "Project Ozma", after the Queen of Oz in L. Frank Baum's fantasy books. Drake used a radio telescope [...] in diameter at Green Bank, West Virginia, to examine the stars Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani near the 1.420 <b>gigahertz</b> marker frequency, a region of the radio spectrum dubbed the [...] "water hole" [...] due to its proximity to the hydrogen and hydroxyl radical spectral lines. A 400 kilohertz band around the marker frequency was scanned, using a single-channel receiver with a bandwidth of 100 hertz. He found nothing of interest.|$|E
2500|$|Klystrons {{can produce}} far higher {{microwave}} power outputs than solid state microwave {{devices such as}} Gunn diodes. [...] In modern systems, they are used from UHF (hundreds of megahertz) up to hundreds of <b>gigahertz</b> (as in the Extended Interaction Klystrons in the CloudSat satellite). Klystrons {{can be found at}} work in radar, satellite and wideband high-power communication (very common in television broadcasting and EHF satellite terminals), medicine (radiation oncology), and high-energy physics (particle accelerators and experimental reactors). At SLAC, for example, klystrons are routinely employed which have outputs in the range of 50MW (pulse) and 50kW (time-averaged) at 2856MHz. The Arecibo Planetary Radar uses two klystrons that provide a total power output of 1MW (continuous) at 2380MHz.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory {{developed}} a maser to provide ultra-low-noise amplification of S-band microwave signals received from deep space probes. This maser used deeply refrigerated hydrogen to chill the amplifier {{down to a}} temperature of four kelvin. Amplification was achieved by exciting a ruby comb with a 12.0 <b>gigahertz</b> klystron. In the early years, it took days to chill and remove the impurities from the hydrogen lines. Refrigeration was a two-stage process with a large Linde unit on the ground, and a crosshead compressor within the antenna. The final injection was at [...] through a [...] micrometer-adjustable entry to the chamber. The whole system noise temperature looking at cold sky (2.7 kelvins in the microwave band) was 17 kelvins. This gave such a low noise figure that the Mariner IV space probe could send still pictures from Mars back to the Earth even though the output power of its radio transmitter was only 15 watts, and hence the total signal power received was only -169 decibels {{with respect to a}} milliwatt (dBm).|$|E
2500|$|The {{follow-on}} to META {{was named}} [...] "BETA", for [...] "Billion-channel Extraterrestrial Assay", and it commenced observation on October 30, 1995. The heart of BETA's processing capability consisted of 63 dedicated fast Fourier transform (FFT) engines, each capable of performing a 222-point complex FFTs in two seconds, and 21 general-purpose personal computers equipped with custom {{digital signal processing}} boards. This allowed BETA to receive 250 million simultaneous channels with a resolution of 0.5 hertz per channel. It scanned through the microwave spectrum from 1.400 to 1.720 <b>gigahertz</b> in eight hops, with two seconds of observation per hop. An important capability of the BETA search was rapid and automatic re-observation of candidate signals, achieved by observing the sky with two adjacent beams, one slightly {{to the east and}} the other slightly to the west. A successful candidate signal would first transit the east beam, and then the west beam and do so with a speed consistent with Earth's sidereal rotation rate. A third receiver observed the horizon to veto signals of obvious terrestrial origin. On March 23, 1999, the 26-meter radio telescope on which Sentinel, META and BETA were based was blown over by strong winds and seriously damaged. This forced the BETA project to cease operation.|$|E
2500|$|A {{microwave}} oven heats food by passing microwave radiation through it. [...] Microwaves are {{a form of}} non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation with a frequency higher than ordinary radio waves but lower than infrared light. [...] Microwave ovens use frequencies {{in one of the}} ISM (industrial, scientific, medical) bands, which are reserved for this use, so they do not interfere with other vital radio services. [...] Consumer ovens usually use 2.45 <b>gigahertz</b> (GHz)—a wavelength of —while large industrial/commercial ovens often use 915 megahertz (MHz)—. Water, fat, and other substances in the food absorb energy from the microwaves in a process called dielectric heating. Many molecules (such as those of water) are electric dipoles, meaning that they have a partial positive charge at one end and a partial negative charge at the other, and therefore rotate as they try to align themselves with the alternating electric field of the microwaves. Rotating molecules hit other molecules and put them into motion, thus dispersing energy. This energy, when dispersed as molecular vibration in solids and liquids (i.e. as both potential energy and kinetic energy of atoms), is heat. Sometimes, microwave heating is explained as a resonance of water molecules, but this is incorrect; such resonances occur only at above 1 terahertz (THz). Rather it is the lag in response of the polar water molecule to the impinging electromagnetic wave. This type of dielectric loss mechanism is referred to as dipole interaction.|$|E
2500|$|Hull's {{magnetron}} was not {{originally intended}} to generate VHF (very-high-frequency) electromagnetic waves. [...] However, in 1924, Czech physicist August Žáček (1886–1961) and German physicist Erich Habann (1892–1968) independently discovered that the magnetron could generate waves of 100 megahertz to 1 <b>gigahertz.</b> [...] Žáček, a professor at Prague's Charles University, published first; however, he published in a journal with a small circulation and thus attracted little attention. Habann, {{a student at the}} University of Jena, investigated the magnetron for his doctoral dissertation of 1924. Throughout the 1920s, Hull and other researchers around the world worked to develop the magnetron.(2) Japanese engineers: Hidetsugu Yagi, [...] "Beam transmission of ultra-short waves," [...] Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers, vol. 16, no. 6, pages 715-741 (1928). Magnetrons are discussed in Part II of this article. See also: (i) Kinjiro Okabe, , Journal of the Institute of Electrical Engineering of Japan, pages 284ff (March 1928); (ii) Kinjiro Okabe, [...] "On the short-wave limit of magnetron oscillations," [...] Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers, vol. 17, no. 4, pages 652-659 (1929); (iii) Kinjiro Okabe, [...] "On the magnetron oscillation of new type," [...] Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers, vol. 18, no. 10, pages 1748-1749 (1930). Most of these early magnetrons were glass vacuum tubes with multiple anodes. However, the two-pole magnetron, also known as a split-anode magnetron, had relatively low efficiency. The cavity version (properly referred to as a resonant-cavity magnetron) proved to be far more useful. In 1937–1940 a multi-cavity magnetron was built by the British physicist John Randall, together with a team of British coworkers, for the British and American military radar installations in World War II.|$|E
