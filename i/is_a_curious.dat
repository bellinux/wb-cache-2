25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> {{fact that}} amaurotic family idiocy, {{a rare and}} fatal disease of children, occurs mostly among Jews. The largest number of cases has been {{observed}} in the United States—over thirty in number. It was at first {{thought that this was}} an exclusively Jewish disease because most of the cases at first reported were between Russian and Polish Jews; but recently there have been reported cases occurring in non-Jewish children. The chief characteristics of the disease are progressive mental and physical enfeeblement; weakness and paralysis of all the extremities; and marasmus, associated with symmetrical changes in the macula lutea. On investigation of the reported cases, they found that neither consanguinity nor syphilitic, alcoholic, or nervous antecedents in the family history are factors in the etiology of the disease. No preventive measures have as yet been discovered, and no treatment has been of benefit, all the cases having terminated fatally.|$|E
25|$|Zimmer Comes to the Front With an Indoor GameCharley Zimmer, the good-natured and gentlemanly catcher of the Cleveland Club has invented and {{patented}} {{an indoor}} game of base ball {{that ought to}} make him a little fortune. It promises {{to become one of the}} greatest toys of the age. A regular game can be played. The ball is pitched from an ingenious device and goes straight over the plate. If a hit isn't made or the ball struck at all the 'catcher' gets it. All the 'players' are in position, and there are regular catches in the outfield and pick-ups in the infield. The bat <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> contrivance, and it takes good judgment to operate it. A fast or slow ball can be pitched, and the batter is liable to be 'fooled' by changes of pace. Nothing like it was ever seen before in toy games. The invention is to be shown in Hudson's window after Thanksgiving, and will surely attract great attention.|$|E

500|$|During {{this period}} Gaudí {{contributed to a}} group project, the Rosary of Montserrat (1900–1916).

500|$|As a symbol, the sea has {{for centuries}} {{played a role}} in {{literature}} and poetry. Sometimes, it is there just as a gentle background but often it introduces such themes as storm, shipwreck, battle, hardship, disaster, the dashing of hopes, or death. In his epic poem the Odyssey, written in the 8th century BC, Homer describes the ten-year voyage of the Greek hero Odysseus who struggles to return home across the sea's many hazards after the war described in the Iliad. The sea is a recurring theme in the Haiku poems of the Japanese poet Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694). In modern literature, sea-inspired novels have been written by the sailors Herman Melville, Joseph Conrad, and Herman Wouk. The psychiatrist Carl Jung argued that, in dream interpretation, the sea symbolizes the personal and the collective unconscious. Although the origin of life on Earth is still a matter of debate, naturalist Rachel Carson wrote in The Sea Around Us that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> situation that the sea, from which life first arose, should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life.

500|$|Buffy studies scholar Roz Kaveney {{states that}} estrangement from {{the self and}} others is the primary theme of the fourth season. To {{illustrate}} the absolute search for identity, the series writers created Adam, who is more truly alone than is anyone else. He is a creature assembled from a man, vampires, demons, and cutting edge cybernetic technology. Adam {{was not the first}} re-animated corpse to be presented in the series. [...] "Some Assembly Required" [...] in the second season also had a Frankenstein monster-like creation and [...] "Beauty and the Beasts" [...] in the third includes references to Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde; both touch on the misuse or abuse of science. Adam is a clear reference to Frankenstein's monster, who in the novel Frankenstein (1818) tells his creator that he is the [...] "Adam of your labours". Mary Shelley wrote the novel to highlight the problems progress, science, and industry create for humanity. Throughout the action, the monster constantly asks what he is and why he was created. Likewise, Adam escapes from 314 and makes his way out into the world, and much like Frankenstein's monster, he finds a little boy and asks the boy who and what he (Adam) is, then murders and dissects him. Adam <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> character, seeking the truth and pontificating on what he has learned, even if he gained the knowledge through heartless violence. Whedon wanted Adam to be inquisitive and introspective, directing George Hertzberg to [...] "find the stillness" [...] in the character. Roz Kaveney notes that Hertzberg's [...] "flawed but impressive performance" [...] includes Adam's interesting idiosyncrasy of pausing each time he speaks, as if he is creating meaning with his own words and must consider the implications of what he is saying. Author Nikki Stafford connects Adam's need to learn about the world around him to Frankenstein's monster: Adam must understand why other people are here and why he has emotions, a peculiarity of his creation as Dr. Walsh never encouraged others to question her. One Buffy studies writer draws comparisons between Dr. Walsh and Victor Frankenstein, both of whom build monsters out of body parts [...] "to compensate for human vulnerability". The moral of Shelley's novel is that what science can accomplish is not necessarily what it should.|$|E
500|$|One of the curiosities of {{the place}} is Hautville's Quoit, which, to save time, should also be looked for on {{approaching}} the village. (Enter iron gate on L. {{a few hundred yards}} before reaching tollhouse, and search backwards along the hedge bordering road.) It is a large stone, which legend says was hurled by Sir J. Hautville (whose effigy is in Chew Magna Church) from the top of Maes Knoll. The famous [...] "druidical remains" [...] will be found near the church. About 50yards from the entrance to the churchyard take a lane to the L. leading to an orchard: the stones will be observed in the field beyond (admission free, but field closed on Sundays). The [...] "remains" [...] consist of three contiguous circles. The first is of considerable area, and is marked out by twelve large stones, only three of which remain upright; a smaller circle of eight stones lies just beyond; and a third circle of eight will be found farther away in an orchard on the R. The two larger circles have each a few scattered stones thrown off as a kind of avenue. Standing apart from the circles <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> group of three stones huddled together in a garden abutting on the churchyard, from which they can be easily seen by looking over the W. boundary wall. These mystic rings probably had the same origin (whatever that may have been) as that of the more famous circle at Avebury in Wiltshire, with which they should be compared. The proximity of Maes Knoll is comparable with that of Silbury Hill. A ridiculous theory suggests that the monoliths were erected as a trophy after one of Arthur's victories. Arthur is connected to the site because a site in the nearby village of Camerley is reputed to be the location of Camelot in an oral tradition. The stones are of a reddish hue similar to that described in the Arthurian legend as connected to Camelot and to a sword that was seen in a stone near to Camelot. The country story is that a local wedding once took place on a Sunday, when the frivolous guests would insist on winding up with a dance. The penalty for a [...] "Sabbath" [...] thus [...] "profaned" [...] was the prompt transformation of the bridal party into stone. Hence the local appellation of [...] "The fiddlers and the maids".|$|E
500|$|Producer Jan Harlan {{stated that}} Kubrick [...] "would have applauded" [...] the final film, while Kubrick's widow Christiane also enjoyed A.I. Brian Aldiss admired {{the film as}} well: [...] "I thought what an inventive, intriguing, ingenious, {{involving}} film this was. There are flaws in it and I suppose I might have a personal quibble but it's so long since I wrote it." [...] Of the film's ending, he wondered how {{it might have been}} had Kubrick directed the film: [...] "That is one of the 'ifs' of film history—at least the ending indicates Spielberg adding some sugar to Kubrick's wine. The actual ending is overly sympathetic and moreover rather overtly engineered by a plot device that does not really bear credence. But it's a brilliant piece of film and of course it's a phenomenon because it contains the energies and talents of two brilliant filmmakers." [...] Richard Corliss heavily praised Spielberg's direction, as well as the cast and visual effects. Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, saying that it was [...] "wonderful and maddening." [...] Leonard Maltin, on the other hand, gives the film two stars out of four in his Movie Guide, writing: [...] " [...] intriguing story draws us in, thanks in part to Osment's exceptional performance, but takes several wrong turns; ultimately, it just doesn't work. Spielberg rewrote the adaptation Stanley Kubrick commissioned of the Brian Aldiss short story 'Super Toys Last All Summer Long'; [...] result <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>curious</b> and uncomfortable hybrid of Kubrick and Spielberg sensibilities." [...] However, he calls John Williams' music score [...] "striking". Jonathan Rosenbaum compared A.I. to Solaris (1972), and praised both [...] "Kubrick for proposing that Spielberg direct the project and Spielberg for doing his utmost to respect Kubrick's intentions while making it a profoundly personal work." [...] Film critic Armond White, of the New York Press, praised the film noting that [...] "each part of David’s journey through carnal and sexual universes into the final eschatological devastation becomes as profoundly philosophical and contemplative as anything by cinema’s most thoughtful, speculative artists– Borzage, Ozu, Demy, Tarkovsky." [...] Filmmaker Billy Wilder hailed A.I. as [...] "the most underrated film of the past few years." [...] When British filmmaker Ken Russell saw the film, he wept during the ending.|$|E
