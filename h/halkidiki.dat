2500|$|Across {{the border}} in Greece, Slavophones were seen as a {{potentially}} disloyal [...] "fifth column" [...] within the Greek state by both the US and Greece, and their existence as a minority was officially denied. Greeks were resettled in the region many of whom emigrated (especially to Australia) along with many Greek-speaking natives, because of the hard economic conditions after the Second World War and the Greek Civil War. Although there was some liberalization between 1959 and 1967, the Greek military dictatorship re-imposed harsh restrictions. The situation gradually eased after Greece's return to democracy, although even {{as recently as the}} 1990s Greece has been criticised by international human rights activists for [...] "harassing" [...] Macedonian Slav political activists, who, nonetheless, are free to maintain their own political party (Rainbow). Elsewhere in Greek Macedonia, economic development after the war was brisk and the area rapidly became the most prosperous part of the region. The coast was heavily developed for tourism, particularly on the <b>Halkidiki</b> peninsula.|$|E
