40|$|AbstractA map is a cell {{decomposition}} of a closed surface; it is regular if its automorphism group acts transitively on the flags, mutually incident vertex-edge-face triples. The {{main purpose of}} this paper is to establish, by elementary methods, the following result: for each positive integer w and for each pair of integersp≥ 3 and q≥ 3 satisfying 1 /p+ 1 /q≤ 1 / 2, there is an orientable regular map with face-size p and valency q such that every non-contractible simple closed curve on the surface meets the 1 -skeleton of the map in at least w points. This result has several interesting consequences concerning maps on surfaces, graphs and related concepts.

40|$|Research endeavors in {{architectural}} design {{date back to}} the foundations of building construction itself. Remarkably, the true limitations of design procedures stem from the confined boundaries preset in the mind of mankind. Even the perceptions an architect holds throughout the complex process of designing an architectural wonder, contributes to a fundamental impact on the performed procedures commonly applied. Research methodologies in architecture and design, tend to primarily focus on architectural visions, trends or the actual design features of a construction, and not on the person behind <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> <b>Following</b> efforts directed towards a trajectory that encircles the architect and his or her perception regarding architecture and design research, this work aims to highlight the views of many prominent architects whose architectural wonders have served as crucial milestones in history and influenced generations of people. A weave between an architect and her or his surroundings, cannot be treated as an isolated event. Puzzle pieces of gender roles, performatives, social influences, and insight regarding architectural research methods contribute to a larger architectural image and evolution. In order to establish the actual relations between architectural perspectives and words that support these, a chosen approach is to quote architects on issues considering architectural research endeavors. Similarly, underlying key points are elucidated with quotes that would communicate noteworthy aspects of adjacent theories...|$|R
