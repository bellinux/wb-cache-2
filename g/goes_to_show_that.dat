25|$|Of the New Testament, {{attempts}} at translation {{must have been}} made very early, and among the ancient versions of New Testament scripture, the Syriac in all likelihood is the earliest. It was at Antioch, the capital of Syria, that the disciples of Christ were first called Christians, and it seemed natural that the first translation of the Christian Scriptures should have been made there. The tendency of recent research, however, <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> Edessa, the literary capital, was more likely the place.|$|E
25|$|The {{attitude}} of the Legion's soldiers {{was similar to that}} of the Italian Battaglione Azad Hindoustan, which had been of dubious loyalty to the Axis cause—it was disbanded after a mutiny. In one instance, immediately prior to the first deployment of the Legion in the Netherlands in April 1943, after the departure of the 1st Battalion from Königsbrück, two companies within the 2nd Battalion refused to move until convinced by Indian leaders. Even in Asia, where the Indian National Army was much larger and fought the British directly, Bose faced similar obstacles at first. All of this <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> many of the men never possessed loyalty to the Nazi cause or ideology; the motivation of the Legion's men was to fight for India's independence. The unit did allegedly participate in atrocities, especially in the Médoc region in July 1944, and in the region of Ruffec and the department of Indre during their retreat, and in addition, some elements of the unit undertook anti-partisan operations in Italy.|$|E

I just fell in love with it; it gets under your skin. Woodside Petroleum are planning to build one of the world's biggest LNG (liquified natural gas) processing plants on the Kimberley coast, just north of Broome. They would be drilling for the gas out at sea and bringing it onshore at this plant, which would just be devastating for the region. The question everyone is asking is, why not process it offshore or pipe it to one of the mining towns down south that already have the infrastructure in place? Why ruin the Kimberley if there's an alternative? ...|$|E
500|$|Three main {{theories}} {{attempt to}} explain {{the reasons for the}} [...] "Hungarian land-taking". One argues that it was an intended military operation, prearranged following previous raids, with the express purpose of occupying a new homeland. This view (represented, for instance, by Bakay and Padányi) mainly follows the narration of Anonymous and later Hungarian chronicles. The opposite view maintains that a joint attack by the Pechenegs and the Bulgarians forced the Hungarians' hand. Kristó, Tóth and the theory's other followers refer to the unanimous testimony provided by the Annals of Fulda, Regino of Prüm and Porphyrogenitus on the connection between the Hungarians' conflict with the Bulgar-Pecheneg coalition and their withdrawal from the Pontic steppes. An intermediate theory proposes that the Hungarians had for decades been considering a westward move when the Bulgarian-Pecheneg attack accelerated their decision to leave the Pontic steppes. For instance Róna-Tas argues, [...] " [...] fact that, despite a series of unfortunate events, the Magyars managed to keep their heads above water <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> they were indeed ready to move on" [...] when the Pechenegs attacked them.|$|E

500|$|Since its broadcast, [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{garnered}} {{little to}} no scrutiny from viewers. Vitti has never gotten any questions about the episode, except from his sister-in-law who wanted him to explain the episode for his nephews. [...] " [...] My sister-in-law called me up saying that I {{needed to talk to}} my nephews about how this was wrong that Homer did", Vitti said. [...] "They watched it and had lots of questions for her. And she referred them all to me. So {{there are some people who}} are still bothered by it." [...] The little amount of scrutiny that the episode attracted took The Simpsons staff by surprise, as they anticipated that the episode would generate a lot of controversy. Instead, [...] "Blame It on Lisa", an episode which aired the previous week, caused an uproar in Brazil because of its depiction of the country. It became one of the biggest controversies the series has ever faced. [...] "It just <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> you never know what's going to be a problem", Jean said in the DVD commentary for [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's".|$|E
500|$|USA Todays Robert Bianco credits Monica and Chandler's {{relationship}} and their wedding in the episode [...] "The One With Monica and Chandler's Wedding" [...] with saving Friends. Prior to the episode, the show had [...] "appeared {{to be in}} serious danger of out-staying its welcome." [...] Although admitting that the overall episode [...] "is not one of Friends best", Bianco explained that [...] "The wedding changed all that, and in remarkable fashion." [...] While BuzzFeed ranked Monica and Chandler the 23rd best television couple, E! placed the couple second on its ranking of the greatest Friends couples, with author Sydney Bucksbaum writing, [...] "It's {{hard to imagine a}} time when Monica and Chandler weren't together, but it took them four seasons to actually get together. From then on, it was clear that they were meant to be." [...] Tim Gerstenberger of TV Overmind echoed this sentiment by ranking Chandler Monica's best boyfriend, awarding him an 'A' grade. Gerstenberger penned, [...] "I {{would not be able to}} face myself every day if I did not rank Chandler the best of Monica’s boyfriends from Friends. The two ended up getting married, which just <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> some one night stands are meant to last." [...] Monica and Ross' relationship was also influential. According to Kriti Tulsiani of IBNLive, the characters [...] "provide a perfect exception to the myth that one cannot find a best friend in their sibling particularly when they are of opposite sex ... they have broken all the conventional boundaries of a brother-sister relationship." [...] PopSugar ranked Monica and Ross fifth on the website's list of [...] "The 9 Best Sibling Relationships From '90s TV" ...|$|E
500|$|Following the song's {{release on}} January 23, 1985, {{as the second}} single from Like a Virgin, [...] "Material Girl" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. Author Rikky Rooksby, in his book The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, compared the song with those of Cyndi Lauper because of Madonna's shrill voice in the song. He added that the song was a [...] "pungent satire on the Reagan/Thatcher young-guns-go-for-it era. Which just <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> pop music and irony don't mix." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic said that [...] "Material Girl" [...] {{was one of the}} songs that made Madonna an icon, the other being [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] from the same album, both remaining as a definitive statement. He added that both tunes overshadow the rest of the record, [...] "because they are a perfect match of theme and sound." [...] Debby Miller from Rolling Stone, felt that the song portrayed Madonna as a more practical girl than previous female singers. Dave Karger from Entertainment Weekly, while reviewing the album in 1995, felt that the song came off a bit repetitious and immature when compared to the present context. Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly felt that the song provided then critics a way to criticize Madonna's work. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented that Madonna had [...] "defined a generation with hits like 'Material Girl'." [...] Alfred Soto from Stylus Magazine compared the song with [...] "Everything She Wants" [...] by Wham!. Michael Paoletta from Billboard commented that the song sustained a [...] "fevered dance-rock momentum." [...] Nancy Erlick from Billboard said that [...] "singer and team conquer once more with their irresistible assembly of new and used pop hooks." [...] In 2003, Madonna fans were asked to vote for their Top 20 Madonna singles of all time for a special issue of Q magazine dedicated to Madonna. [...] "Material Girl" [...] was allocated the 15th spot on the list.|$|E

During the offseason, I train three to five days a week, and then I train every day in the water.

2500|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a {{turnover}} in perspectives towards {{the causes of the}} Great famine {{in the mind of the}} Irish-American that can be traced: one that varies from a [...] "mourning religious view", seen in Archbishop Hughes' sermon, to a perspective that shifts the blame towards the British monarchy for its indifference and greed, seen in Cahill's speech in 1860. From that point on, all the following commemorative speeches on the Saint Patrick's Day invoked nationalist themes such as [...] "British hatred" [...] and [...] "heroic struggle" [...] and led the way for the creation of a [...] "new parade" [...] which gained in adherents and absorbed [...] "elements of American patriotism and full-fledged nationalism". The end result was such that the Irish-American community came to regard itself in the 1870s as a community that defined itself by dual loyalties on one hand, and in another as [...] "a unified common organism," [...] which gathered in strength on the basis that they had a common past, [...] "not a religious one but one that centered on the common Irish experience of British oppression and suffering". In other words, this <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the shifting character of commemorative rituals experienced during the Saint Patrick's parade have influenced the development of American culture in a larger sense, since it contributed to enriching its heritage and making of its Irish-American Diaspora a prideful concept to be celebrated and admired.|$|E
