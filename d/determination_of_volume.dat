50|$|Applications of a {{eudiometer}} {{include the}} analysis of gases and the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>volume</b> differences in chemical reactions. The eudiometer is filled with water, inverted so that its open end is facing the ground (while holding the open end so that no water escapes), and then submersed in a basin of water. A chemical reaction is taking place through which gas is created. One reactant is typically {{at the bottom of}} the eudiometer (which flows downward when the eudiometer is inverted) and the other reactant is suspended on the rim of the eudiometer, typically by means of a platinum or copper wire (due to their low reactivity). When the gas created by the chemical reaction is released, it should rise into the eudiometer so that the experimenter may accurately read the volume of the gas produced at any given time. Normally a person would read the volume when the reaction is completed. This procedure is followed in many experiments, including an experiment in which one experimentally determines the Ideal gas law constant R.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>volume</b> effects for {{correlation}} functions {{that depend on}} an external momentum. As a specific example, we consider finite volume nucleon current correlators, {{and focus on the}} nucleon magnetic moment. Because the multipole decomposition relies on SO(3) rotational invariance, the structure of such finite volume corrections is unrelated to infinite volume multipole form factors. One can deduce volume corrections to the magnetic moment only when a zero-mode photon coupling vanishes, as occurs at next-to-leading order in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. To deduce such finite volume corrections, however, one must assume continuous momentum transfer. In practice, volume corrections with momentum transfer dependence are required to address the extraction of the magnetic moment, or other observables that arise in momentum dependent correlation functions. Additionally we shed some light on a puzzle concerning differences in lattice form factor data at equal values of momentum transfer squared. Comment: 21 pages, 5 figures; discussion in Sect.

It can be used on problems that are not even continuous. DE assumes a population of candidate solution and creates a new candidate solution by combining existing ones in accordance to its formula.

40|$|Commission The <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> urban {{vegetation}} <b>volume</b> {{is getting}} more and more important within the frame of an ecologically orientated city planning. Conventional methods like the height categorization of typical kinds of vegetation followed by multiplication with the area are costly and complicated during survey but remain exact. Since there are several cities which already have laser scanner data for creating 3 -D city models the idea emerges of using this data for the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> urban vegetation <b>volume.</b> It is a problem that the date of survey of Digital Elevation Models (DEM) is not within the vegetation period and therefore interferes considerably with the survey <b>of</b> the vegetation <b>volume.</b> That’s why this paper deals with the question whether laser scanner data that has not been taken during the vegetation period allows a <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> vegetation <b>volume</b> with sufficient accuracy. Therefore laser scanner data has been compared to photogrammetrically determined vegetation height measurements. Despite a relatively high laser point density of one point per m it has to be considered that almost 80 % of the measurement points in the vegetation stock have been classified as ground points because the non-leaf tree branches have led to insufficient reflections. Even with the measurement data classified as non-ground points, the vegetation height has been underestimated by approximately 50 % on average. Thus the subtraction of the laser-based Elevation Model (DEM) and Surface Model (DSM) in vegetation areas leads to a sufficient underestimation <b>of</b> vegetation <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> up to 85 %. By applying correcting methods this error is to be corrected and might lead to a sufficiently exact and efficient <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> vegetation <b>volume</b> on the basis of laser scanner data of aerial flight times during non-vegetation periods.
