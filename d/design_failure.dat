5|$|The Bucknill Committee, {{which had}} been set up to {{investigate}} the loss of major warships, also produced a report. This report said that the lack of backup power sources was a major <b>design</b> <b>failure,</b> which contributed to the loss: Ark Royal depended on electricity for much of her operation, and once the boilers and steam-driven dynamos were knocked out, the loss of power made damage control difficult. The committee recommended the design of the bulkheads and boiler intakes be improved to decrease the risk of widespread flooding in boiler rooms and machine spaces, while the uninterrupted boiler room flat was criticised. The design flaws were rectified in the Illustrious- and Implacable-class carriers, under construction at the time.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1995, the Llama Mini-Max was introduced. It was {{produced}} in [...] 9mm Parabellum and 38 Super (8-round capacity), [...]40 S (7-round capacity) and [...]45 ACP (6-round capacity) with a 3.7-inch barrel. The overall length was 7.3 inches and the height 5.1 inches. Designed for concealed carry, it featured an extended safety lever, rounded hammer, Swartz safety, 3-dot sight, checkered neoprene grips and contoured trigger-guard. {{the use of a}} flared muzzle eliminated the traditional Llama barrel bushing and made disassemby easier. Standard 1911-type magazines could be used in the [...]45 ACP model, increasing capacity by one or two rounds. A wide range of finishes were available including matte blue, satin chrome, and two-tone. Initial reviews were disappointing citing mediocre accuracy and occasional malfunctions, but these may be related to quality control issues and ammunition choice rather than <b>design</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} two important issues in Case-based Design (CBD) : {{a structure of}} design cases and a process of design adaptation for handling <b>design</b> <b>failures.</b> The structure of design cases involves problem situation, design specification, design tasks, design solutions, causal explanation, past <b>design</b> <b>failures</b> as well as design performance.

50|$|Original {{equipment}} manufacturers undergo a thorough analysis {{to determine whether}} a device should be single-use or reusable. Factors in determining to label a device single-use include {{but are not limited to}} possible infection/sterility concerns and the risk of reduced efficacy. Depending on the device and its <b>design,</b> <b>failure</b> to completely clean a single-use device could lead to cross patient infection or there is the risk that the chemicals used to clean the device will themselves pose a risk to patients by being absorbed, for example, by the plastic from which the device is made and then subsequently leaching out into a patient's body. There can also be the risk of deterioration of the device when exposed to cleaning or sterilization processes which could lead to device malfunction. When a manufacturer designs and develops a product, it determines the materials used and how the device is labeled. In the U.S., to market a device as ‚Äúreusable‚Äù, a manufacturer must provide increased data requirements and invest the resources necessary to demonstrate to FDA that the product can be safely reprocessed at the hospital level. Unlike reusable devices, single-use devices are not sold with instructions on how they can be properly cleaned and sterilized nor have they been validated or tested for exposure to cleaning or sterilization processes, including chemical exposure and heat.|$|E
50|$|For any system, one of {{the first}} tasks of {{reliability}} engineering is to adequately specify the reliability and maintainability requirements allocated from the overall availability needs and, more importantly, derived from proper <b>design</b> <b>failure</b> analysis or preliminary prototype test results. Clear requirements (able to designed to) should constrain the designers from designing particular unreliable items / constructions / interfaces / systems. Setting only availability, reliability, testability, or maintainability targets (e.g., max. failure rates) is not appropriate. This is a broad misunderstanding about Reliability Requirements Engineering. Reliability requirements address the system itself, including test and assessment requirements, and associated tasks and documentation. Reliability requirements are included in the appropriate system or subsystem requirements specifications, test plans, and contract statements. Creation of proper lower-level requirements is critical.Provision of only quantitative minimum targets (e.g., MTBF values or failure rates) is not sufficient for different reasons. One reason is that a full validation (related to correctness and verifiability in time) of a quantitative reliability allocation (requirement spec) on lower levels for complex systems can (often) not be made as a consequence of (1) the fact that the requirements are probabilistic, (2) the extremely high level of uncertainties involved for showing compliance with all these probabilistic requirements, and because (3) reliability is a function of time, and accurate estimates of a (probabilistic) reliability number per item are available only very late in the project, sometimes even after many years of in-service use. Compare this problem with the continuous (re-)balancing of, for example, lower-level-system mass requirements in the development of an aircraft, which is already often a big undertaking. Notice that in this case masses do only differ in terms of only some %, are not a function of time, the data is non-probabilistic and available already in CAD models. In case of reliability, the levels of unreliability (failure rates) may change with factors of decades (multiples of 10) as result of very minor deviations in design, process, or anything else. The information is often not available without huge uncertainties within the development phase. This makes this allocation problem almost impossible to do in a useful, practical, valid manner that does not result in massive over- or under-specification. A pragmatic approach is therefore needed‚Äîfor example: the use of general levels / classes of quantitative requirements depending only on severity of failure effects. Also, the validation of results is a far more subjective task than for any other type of requirement. (Quantitative) reliability parameters‚Äîin terms of MTBF‚Äîare by far the most uncertain design parameters in any design.|$|E
