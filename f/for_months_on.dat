5|$|Secretary Stanton ordered McClellan {{to report}} to Trenton, New Jersey, for further orders, {{although}} none were issued. As the war progressed, there were various calls to return McClellan to an important command, following the Union defeats at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, as Robert E. Lee moved north {{at the start of}} the Gettysburg Campaign, and as Jubal Early threatened Washington in 1864. When Ulysses S. Grant became general-in-chief, he discussed returning McClellan to an unspecified position. But all of these opportunities were impossible, given the opposition within the administration and the knowledge that McClellan posed a potential political threat. McClellan worked <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>on</b> a lengthy report describing his two major campaigns and his successes in organizing the Army, replying to his critics and justifying his actions by accusing the administration of undercutting him and denying him necessary reinforcements. The War Department was reluctant to publish his report because, just after completing it in October 1863, McClellan openly declared his entrance to the political stage as a Democrat.|$|E

25|$|Bereft {{of further}} combat {{replacements}} for his hard-pressed Marauder battalions, Stilwell {{felt he had}} no choice but to continue offensive operations with his existing forces, using the Marauders as 'the point of the spear' until they had either achieved all their objectives, or were wiped out. He was also concerned that pulling out the Marauders, the only U.S. ground unit in the campaign, resulted in charges of favoritism, forcing him to evacuate the exhausted Chinese and British Chindit forces as well. When General William Slim, commander of British and Commonwealth forces in Burma, informed Stilwell that his men were exhausted and should be withdrawn, Stilwell rejected the idea, insisting that his subordinate commanders simply did not understand enlisted men and their tendency to magnify physical challenges. Having made his own 'long march' out of Burma under his own power using jungle trails, Stilwell found it difficult to sympathize with those who had been in combat in the jungle <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>on</b> end without relief. In retrospect, his statements at the time revealed a lack of understanding of the limitations of lightly equipped unconventional forces when used in conventional roles. Myitkyina and the dispute over evacuation policy precipitated a hurried Army Inspector General investigation, followed by U.S. congressional committee hearings, though no disciplinary measures were taken against General Stilwell for his decisions as overall commander.|$|E

500|$|Given that Gibraltar was a {{small town}} {{with only a few}} defences {{protecting}} it, the solution was to build a massive series of tunnels and chambers inside the natural protection of the Rock of Gibraltar. This [...] "town" [...] inside the Rock contained its own power station, water supply, and hospital. Some soldiers posted here would not {{see the light of day}} <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>on</b> end. Two Canadian engineer companies, the only soldiers with diamond-tipped drills and 5 British engineer companies, added some [...] of such tunnels, a feat thought impossible at the time. That was enough to hold all 30,000 troops on the rock. Today, the rock has more underground tunnels than roads.|$|E
500|$|<b>For</b> <b>months</b> <b>on</b> end Jeannette hardly {{moved at}} all; De Long {{recorded}} on March 2 that their position was almost precisely {{what it had}} been three months earlier. On May 5, the ship passed {{to the west of the}} 180° meridian, but two months later had retreated back to the other side of the line. [...] The summer brought no relief; although it briefly seemed possible in August that Jeannette might break free and find open water, this proved a false hope. The condition of Danenhower was a further source of anxiety. His syphilis began to take toll of his body, particularly his left eye which, despite Ambler's repeated operations—stoically endured, given the lack of anesthetic—left the navigator largely incapacitated and unable to perform his duties. On the last day of 1880 De Long wrote in his journal: [...] "I begin the new year by turning over a new leaf, and I hope to God we are turning over a new leaf in our book of luck".|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that in contrast to previous statements {{about the number of}} firings related to the scandal [...] "new internal documents show that the real number of people removed from their jobs is much smaller still: at most, three". The Department of Veterans Affairs did not dispute this number, but said that disciplinary action is being taken against over 100 other employees. Congressional Republicans were outraged. Representative Jeff Miller said. [...] "“Rather than disciplining bad employees, V.A. often just transfers them to other V.A. facilities or puts them on paid leave <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>on</b> end," [...] and [...] "“Everyone knows accountability is a major problem at the department." [...] Miller said that he would introduce new legislation to hasten the firing process. Raymond Kelley, legislative director for Veterans of Foreign Wars, said that “The government firing system is so cumbersome bad employees can continue to be paid for years,” and “We need to show them you can no longer hide just because you have a government job, unclog the middle management that appears {{to be part of the}} problem and get the right people in those positions.” ...|$|E

500|$|Chris Carabott of IGN gave a 9.3 out of 10 to [...] "I Do", {{describing}} it as [...] "delivering some key {{moments in the}} series' history and leaving viewers with a spectacular cliffhanger ending." [...] Carabott complimented Locke's scenes as [...] "short but nonetheless powerful" [...] and praised Matthew Fox's acting, saying he [...] "steals the show {{with one of his}} best performances to date". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Christine Fenno considered that the flashbacks [...] "weren't as exciting as the action on the island, but they were full of fun details" [...] and liked Jack's scenes at the operating room. Jonathan Toomey of AOL's TV Squad called [...] "I Do" [...] "an episode worthy of being called a mid-season finale", thinking that the romantic scenes between Kate and Sawyer worked for [...] "the tension that existed". [...] BuddyTV's Oscar Dahl considered [...] "I Do" [...] as [...] "a worthy end to Lost's truncated Fall season", having a good reaction to the cliffhanger and saying the episode [...] "set up incredible possibilities {{for the rest of the}} season". Not all reviews were positive, with Slant Magazines critic Andrew Dignan feeling it was [...] "lacking both the immediacy and urgency that keeps viewers clamoring <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>on</b> end", and being critical of the writing, particularly on most of the essential plot elements occurring in the final minutes.|$|E

For the average large company driver in the United States 6 weeks is the average, with each week out garnering the driver one day off. This accrues to a set maximum usually 6 or 7 days.

2500|$|Critic Steve Huey of AllMusic {{writes that}} the album's {{influence}} [...] "was felt more in spirit than in direct copycatting, as a catalyst rather than a literal musical starting point. However, its inspiring reimagining of what was possible in a rock context {{laid the groundwork for}} countless experiments in rock surrealism to follow, especially during the punk and new wave era." [...] In 2003, the album was ranked sixtieth by Rolling Stone in their list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time: [...] "On first listen, Trout Mask Replica sounds like raw Delta blues," [...] with Beefheart [...] "...singing and ranting and reciting poetry over fractured guitar licks. But the seeming sonic chaos is an illusion—to construct the songs, the Magic Band rehearsed twelve hours a day <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>on</b> end in a house with the windows blacked out. (Producer Frank Zappa was then able to record most of the album in less than five hours.)
