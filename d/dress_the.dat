5|$|In {{addition}} to working <b>dress,</b> <b>the</b> army {{has a number}} of parade uniforms for ceremonial and non-ceremonial occasions. The most-commonly-seen uniforms are No.1 Dress (full ceremonial, seen at formal occasions such as at the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace) and No.2 Dress (Service Dress), a brown uniform worn for non-ceremonial parades.|$|E
5|$|Avoiding {{stereotypes}} and labeling {{based on personal}} <b>dress,</b> <b>the</b> program uses polo shirts, t-shirts, and other articles of clothing like neckerchiefs as uniforms. Participants uniforms display the White Stag logo, which is a visible reminder of the program's founding vision articulated by Baden-Powell {{at the conclusion of}} the 1933 World Jamboree. The uniform reminds the individual wearing it of their commitment to the program's values. It instills self-esteem in the person and pride in the program. It eliminates class and socio-economic distinctions. Wearing a uniform improves member's behavior and lessens the impact on a person's personal wardrobe.|$|E
5|$|On May 10, 1999, Debra won the Women's Championship from Sable in an Evening Gown match. Usually, in an Evening Gown match, {{the woman}} who {{forcibly}} removes her opponent's dress wins. Because Sable removed Debra's dress, she therefore {{should have been the}} winner. Commissioner Shawn Michaels, however, ruled that he considered {{the woman who}} had lost her <b>dress</b> <b>the</b> winner, crowning Debra the new Women's Champion. Debra lost the Women's Title to Ivory on June 14, due to interference from Nicole Bass.|$|E

5|$|The statue {{that sits}} atop the Burnside Fountain is now {{commonly}} referred to as Turtle Boy. In the tradition of the Manneken Pis in Brussels, Turtle Boy has become an unofficial mascot for Worcester. Much of the local popularity of the statue is due to bawdy insinuations about how the boy and the turtle are portrayed. Anonymous members of the Worcester community sometimes <b>dress</b> <b>the</b> statue in festive clothes for holidays, local bands write crowd-pleasing songs about it, and the statue has even graced postcards of the city.|$|E
5|$|Christus frames his sitter in a {{rigid and}} {{balanced}} architectural setting. She is positioned within a narrow rectangular space, before a wainscotted wall. The image is {{divided by the}} horizontal parallel lines of her wainscot and blouse, which join at the inverted triangle formed by the neckline of her <b>dress.</b> <b>The</b> rendering of the background departs somewhat from contemporary conventions in portraiture: Christus sets the girl against a dark brown wall with little detail, {{in contrast to the}} elaborate interiors of Jan van Eyck, who is often regarded as Christus' master. It is defined entirely by its material, a wooden dado rail along the top and the wainscot that forms the lower portion. The wall sets her in a realistic interior, perhaps intended to represent a space within her home.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson was a Jacobite. The {{records of}} the Spalding Club include a soldier's letter which {{indicates}} it is likely Ferguson was willing to offer refuge to Jacobites {{who participated in the}} Battle of Culloden. Jacobite rebels captured from throughout Scotland were taken to stand trial at Carlisle Castle in 1746. Ferguson and fellow advocate Alexander Lockhart argued in their defence. Prosecutors showed little mercy, calling for the rebels to be executed by hanging. Since the prosecution assumed anyone dressed in tartan was guilty, Ferguson and Lockhart had their servants dress in tartan and appear along with the other defendants. They called each other to the stand to testify as to the whereabouts of the servants and proved that, despite their tartan <b>dress,</b> <b>the</b> defendants could not have taken part in the rebellion. Many were found guilty, but the tactic succeeded, as some of the accused were acquitted, including the Laird of Dunfallandy, a kinsman of Ferguson.|$|E

50|$|Dolores Gonzales (1907-1994) was a Mexican-American fashion {{designer}} based in Tucson, Arizona. She {{is best known}} for blending Native American and Mexican clothing traditions to create distinctive southwest resort wear dresses known as patio <b>dresses,</b> <b>the</b> fiesta <b>dresses,</b> (also known as <b>the</b> pejorative squaw <b>dress).</b> She founded <b>the</b> company Dolores Resort Wear that manufactured <b>dresses</b> for <b>the</b> American market, selling in upscale department stores across the country. He iconic design was appropriated and copied by other designers throughout the southwest becoming seminomas with mid-twentieth century regionalist fashion of the American Southwest. <b>The</b> <b>dress</b> design became <b>the</b> official <b>dress</b> of <b>the</b> American Square-dancing movement.|$|R
5|$|Robert Fletcher, costume {{designer}} {{for the previous}} Star Trek films, was responsible for The Search for Spocks wardrobe. Fletcher's job was to sketch outfits, choose the necessary fabrics, and complete the fittings for principal characters. He collaborated with costumer Jim Linn, who clothed extras and managed the logistics of cleaning, repairing, and tracking costumes. Most of the Starfleet uniforms had already been designed for the previous film, but Fletcher wanted to <b>dress</b> <b>the</b> main characters in civilian clothes. Fletcher developed a mythology behind each outfit; the stone ornaments on Sarek's robe, for instance, were intended to be representative of a Vulcan's level of consciousness. The costumer {{had the advantage of}} access to Paramount's store rooms, which contained literal tons of expensive fabrics.|$|E
5|$|Simonovich-Efimova died on 24 February 1948 in Moscow, Soviet Union. Posthumously, she was {{inducted}} into the International Academy of Puppeteers for her innovations in life-sized puppets. The couple are known as the Adam and Eve of Russian puppetry. She left a large legacy, including around 3,000 works, some of which are housed in a memorial workshop at their former home, though art historians mostly ignored her work {{until the end of the}} 20th century. Her works can be seen in the permanent collections of the Russian Museum, Tretyakov Gallery, the Tver Regional Art Gallery, among others. There have been posthumous solo exhibitions of her work in 1959, 1968 and 1975. In 2011, The Museum of Russian Art (TMORA) in Minneapolis, Minnesota included some of her ethnic paintings of women in their native <b>dress.</b> <b>The</b> following year, her 1935 book, Adventures of a Russian Puppet Theatre: Including Its Discoveries in Making and Performing with Hand-Puppets, Rod-Puppets and Shadow-Figures (English version) was reprinted by Martino Publishing. The Efimova crater on Venus is named after Simonovich-Efimova.|$|E
5|$|The Serjeants had {{for many}} centuries {{exclusive}} {{jurisdiction over the}} Court of Common Pleas, being the only lawyers allowed {{to argue a case}} there. At the same time they had rights of audience in the other central common law courts (the Court of King's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas) and precedence over all other lawyers. Only Serjeants-at-Law could become judges of these courts right up into the 19th century, and socially the Serjeants ranked above Knights Bachelor and Companions of the Bath. Within the Serjeants-at-Law were more distinct orders; the King's Serjeants, particularly favoured Serjeants-at-Law, and within that the King's Premier Serjeant, the Monarch's most favoured Serjeant, and the King's Ancient Serjeant, the oldest. Serjeants (except King's Serjeants) were created by Writ of Summons under the Great Seal of the Realm and wore a special and distinctive <b>dress,</b> <b>the</b> chief feature of which was the coif, a white lawn or silk skullcap, afterwards represented by a round piece of white lace {{at the top of the}} wig.|$|E

5|$|The diverse {{origins of}} Malagasy culture {{are evident in}} its {{tangible}} expressions. The most emblematic instrument of Madagascar, the valiha, is a bamboo tube zither carried to Madagascar by early settlers from southern Borneo, and is very similar in form {{to those found in}} Indonesia and the Philippines today. Traditional houses in Madagascar are likewise similar to those of southern Borneo in terms of symbolism and construction, featuring a rectangular layout with a peaked roof and central support pillar. Reflecting a widespread veneration of the ancestors, tombs are culturally significant in many regions and tend to be built of more durable material, typically stone, and display more elaborate decoration than the houses of the living. The production and weaving of silk {{can be traced back to}} the island's earliest settlers, and Madagascar's national <b>dress,</b> <b>the</b> woven lamba, has evolved into a varied and refined art.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to be born with some physical peculiarity, such as a caul, little wings or membranes beneath his armpits, a tail or teeth; or he was born an orphan. There were practices intended to preserve the supernatural power of the newborn dragon. In the region of Veles, Macedonia, twelve girls would pick cotton, spin yarn from it, weave a cloth from the yarn, made a shirt from the cloth, and finally <b>dress</b> <b>the</b> dragon boy in the shirt. As thought in the region of Leskovac, Serbia, such a boy would only then become able to defeat an ala, when three old women spun yarn, knitted a shirt, and dressed the child in it. All this had to be done in one day and one night, during which time the three women should not have spoken a single word. A similar custom was recorded in western Bulgaria, where it was also believed that the soul of the boy, while he slept in his cradle, left his body and walked around. If he was turned, he would die, as his soul could not return into his body.|$|E
5|$|The flag, when {{carried in}} a {{procession}} or parade or with another flag or flags, {{should be on the}} marching right or alone in the centre at the front. The flag may form a distinctive feature of the unveiling of a statue, monument, or plaque, but should never be used as the covering for the object. As a mark of respect to the flag, it should never be dipped to a person or thing, as opposed to regimental colours, organisational or institutional flags, which may be dipped as a mark of honour. During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag, or when the flag is passing in a parade or in a review, all persons present should face the flag and stand at attention. Those present in uniform should render the appropriate salute. When the flag is in a moving column, persons present will stand at attention or salute as the flag passes them. A dignitary may take the salute without a head <b>dress.</b> <b>The</b> flag salutation should be followed by the playing of the national anthem.|$|E
