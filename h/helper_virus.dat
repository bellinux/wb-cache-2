25|$|In 2008, Sputnik virophage was described, {{the first}} known virophage: it uses the {{machinery}} of a <b>helper</b> <b>virus</b> to reproduce and inhibits reproduction of that <b>helper</b> <b>virus.</b> Sputnik reproduces in amoeba infected by mamavirus, a relative of the mimivirus mentioned above and the largest known virus to date.|$|E
25|$|Safety: Although viral vectors are {{occasionally}} {{created from}} pathogenic viruses, they are modified {{in such a}} way as to minimize the risk of handling them. This usually involves the deletion of a part of the viral genome critical for viral replication. Such a virus can efficiently infect cells but, once the infection has taken place, requires a <b>helper</b> <b>virus</b> to provide the missing proteins for production of new virions.|$|E
2500|$|Zamilon {{does not}} appear to inhibit the ability of its <b>helper</b> <b>virus</b> to {{replicate}} significantly, nor to lyse its host amoebae cells. Although the <b>helper</b> <b>virus</b> formed a high proportion of abnormal virions in the presence of Zamilon, these were also observed at a comparable level in the virophage's absence. This is again unlike Sputnik, which reduces its helper virus's infectivity, inhibits its lysis of amoeba, and is associated with the generation of an increased proportion of abnormal Mimiviridae virions. Bernard La Scola and colleagues, who isolated both Sputnik and Zamilon, state that, if confirmed, this [...] "would question the concept of virophage", which has been considered to be differentiated from most other satellite viruses in having a deleterious effect on its <b>helper</b> <b>virus.</b>|$|E
40|$|Satellite RNAs (satRNAs) and {{satellite}} viruses {{depend on the}} replicase complexes provided by their cognate <b>helper</b> <b>viruses</b> and host plants for replication, pretending that {{they are part of}} the viral genomes. Although satRNAs {{and satellite}} viruses do not share significant nucleotide sequence similarity with the <b>helper</b> <b>viruses,</b> the essential cis-acting elements recognized by the replicase complexes must reside on their genomes, acting as the mimicry for the molecular pretenders. By understanding how this molecular mimicry deceives the <b>helper</b> <b>viruses</b> into supporting the satellites, a significant amount of knowledge of the basic requirements and mechanisms for replication of viruses and satellites has been obtained. Here we review the recent advances in understanding the effects of the cis elements at the termini of satRNAs and satellite viruses on their accumulation. Several well-characterized satellite/helper virus systems, representing the non-coding short satRNAs, mRNA-type long satRNAs, circular satRNAs and satellite viruses, are compared and contrasted. It is concluded that different satellites may adopt different strategies to exploit the replication/transcription/translation machineries of their <b>helper</b> <b>viruses,</b> and different mimicries may be implemented by the same molecular pretender for different biological functions...|$|R
40|$|The {{view that}} {{satellite}} RNAs (satRNAs) and satellite viruses are purely molecular parasites of their cognate <b>helper</b> <b>viruses</b> has changed. The molecular mechanisms underlying the synergistic and/or antagonistic interactions among satRNAs/satellite <b>viruses,</b> <b>helper</b> <b>viruses,</b> and host plants {{are beginning to}} be comprehended. This review aims to summarize the recent achievements in basic and practical research, with special emphasis on the involvement of RNA silencing mechanisms in the pathogenicity, population dynamics, and, possibly, the origin(s) of these subviral agents. With further research following current trends, the comprehensive understanding of satRNAs and satellite viruses could lead to {{new insights into the}} trilateral interactions among host plants, viruses, and satellites...|$|R
40|$|Virus {{satellites}} are widespread subcellular entities, present both in eukaryotic and in prokaryotic cells. Their {{modus vivendi}} involves parasitism {{of the life}} cycle of their inducing <b>helper</b> <b>viruses,</b> which assures their transmission to a new host. However, the evolutionary and ecological implications of satellites on <b>helper</b> <b>viruses</b> remain unclear. Here, using staphylococcal pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) as a model of virus satellites, we experimentally show that <b>helper</b> <b>viruses</b> rapidly evolve resistance to their virus satellites, preventing SaPI proliferation, and SaPIs in turn can readily evolve to overcome phage resistance. Genomic analyses of both these experimentally evolved strains as well as naturally occurring bacteriophages suggest that the SaPIs drive the coexistence of multiple alleles of the phage-coded SaPI inducing genes, as well as sometimes selecting for the absence of the SaPI depressing genes. We report similar (accidental) evolution of resistance to SaPIs in laboratory phages used for Staphylococcus aureus typing and also obtain the same qualitative results in both experimental evolution and phylogenetic studies of Enterococcus faecalis phages and their satellites viruses. In summary, our results suggest that <b>helper</b> and satellite <b>viruses</b> undergo rapid coevolution, which is likely to {{play a key role in}} the evolution and ecology of the viruses as well as their prokaryotic hosts...|$|R

2500|$|All known virophages are {{associated}} with helpers in the giant DNA virus family Mimiviridae. Zamilon is restricted in its range of helper viruses; it can be supported by viruses from [...] Mimivirus-like Mimiviridae lineages B and C, but not from lineage A.

2500|$|Zamilon is a virophage, a {{group of}} small DNA viruses that infect protists and require a <b>helper</b> <b>virus</b> to replicate; they are a type of {{satellite}} virus. Discovered in 2013 in Tunisia, infecting Acanthamoeba polyphaga amoebae, Zamilon most closely resembles Sputnik, the first virophage to be discovered. The name is Arabic for [...] "the neighbour". Its spherical particle is 50–60nm in diameter, and contains a circular double-stranded DNA genome of around 17kb, which is predicted to encode 20 polypeptides. A related strain, Zamilon 2, has been identified in North America.|$|E
50|$|Virusoids, {{while being}} studied in virology, are not {{considered}} as viruses but as subviral particles. Since they depend on <b>helper</b> <b>viruses,</b> they are classified as satellites.

40|$|Background Helper-dependent, or gutted, adenoviruses (Ad) lack viral coding sequences, {{resulting}} in reduced immunotoxicity compared with conventional Ad vectors. Gutted Ad growth requires a conventional Ad to supply replication and packaging functions in trans. Methods that allow high-titer growth of gutted vectors while reducing helper contamination, and which use safer <b>helper</b> <b>viruses,</b> will facilitate {{the use of}} gutted Ad vectors in vivo. Methods Replication-defective <b>helper</b> <b>viruses</b> were generated that are deleted for Ad E 1, E 2 b and E 3 genes, but which contain lox P sites flanking the packaging signal. Complementing Ad packaging cell lines (C 7 -cre cells) were also generated by transfecting 293 cells with the Ad E 2 b genes encoding DNA polymerase and pre-terminal protein, and with a cre-recombinase plasmid. Results We show that C 7 -cre cells allow efficient production of gutted Ad using ΔE 1 + ΔE 2 b + ΔE 3 <b>helper</b> <b>viruses</b> whose growth can be limited by cre- lox P-mediated excision of the packaging signal. Gutted Ad vectors carrying ∼ 28 kb cassettes expressing full-length dystrophin were prepared at high titers, similar to those obtained with E 2 b+ helpers, with a resulting helper contamination of < 1 %. Conclusions These new packaging cell lines and <b>helper</b> <b>viruses</b> offer several significant advantages for gutted Ad vector production. They allow gutted virus amplification using a reduced number of passages, which should reduce the chances of selecting rearranged products. Furthermore, the residual helper contamination in gutted vector preparations should be less able to elicit immunological reactions upon delivery to tissues, since E 2 b-deleted vectors display a profound reduction in viral gene expression.

2500|$|The minimal {{set of the}} {{adenoviral}} genes {{required for}} efficient generation of progeny AAV particles, was discovered by Matsushita, Ellinger et al. This discovery allowed for new production methods of recombinant AAV, which do not require adenoviral co-infection of the AAV-producing cells. [...] In the absence of <b>helper</b> <b>virus</b> or genotoxic factors, AAV DNA can either integrate into the host genome or persist in episomal form. In the former case integration is mediated by Rep78 and Rep68 proteins and requires the presence of ITRs flanking the region being integrated.

40|$|We have {{documented}} {{the effect of}} two nondefective <b>helper</b> <b>viruses,</b> reticuloendotheliosis virus A (REV-A) and chick syncytial virus (CSV) infection on bursal tissue. REV-A infection results in bursal atrophy, destroying both its structural and functional integrity. In contrast, the bursae in CSV-infected chicks, while reduced slightly in size, appear both structurally and functionally normal. REV-A-induced bursal atrophy is not a result of viral replication in the B-lymphocyte as (a) both viruses are capable of inducing, with equal efficiency, the formation of preneoplastic lesions containing proliferating B lymphocytes and (b) it appears that equivalent amounts of viral antigen are expressed in the bursae of chicks infected with either virus. We have examined the phenotype of tumors induced by the replication- defective virus REV-T when replicated by the two different <b>helper</b> <b>viruses,</b> REV-A and CSV. In REV-T(REV-A) -infected chicks, the majority of tumors that develop are negative for IgM expression. In contrast, the majority of tumors induced by REV-T(CSV) infection are IgM+. This finding is confirmed by recovery of IgM- cell lines from REV-T(REV-A) - infected chicks and IgM+ cell lines from REV-T(CSV) -infected chicks. In addition, repopulation studies show that bursal-derived cells that are IgM+ serve as target cells for REV-T(CSV) -induced lymphomas. This study demonstrates, therefore, that REV-T can induce IgM+, B cell lymphomas with high efficiency. We conclude that infections by the <b>helper</b> <b>viruses,</b> REV-A and CSV, differ dramatically in their effects on {{the composition of the}} population of cells that serve as targets for REV-T- induced neoplasia...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{complete}} {{replication of}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) in tissue culture was established using the JFH 1 isolate. To analyze determinants of HCV genome packaging and virion assembly, {{we developed a}} system that supports particle production based on trans-packaging of subgenomic viral RNAs. Using JFH 1 <b>helper</b> <b>viruses,</b> we show that subgenomic JFH 1 replicons lacking the entire core to NS 2 coding region are efficiently encapsidated into infectious virus-like particles. Similarly, chimeric <b>helper</b> <b>viruses</b> with heterologous structural proteins trans-package subgenomic JFH 1 replicons. Like authentic cell culture-produced HCV (HCVcc) particles, these trans-complemented HCV particles (HCVTCP) penetrate target cells in a CD 81 receptor-dependent fashion. Since HCVTCP production was limited by competition between the helper and subgenomic RNA and to avoid contamination of HCVTCP stocks with <b>helper</b> <b>viruses,</b> we created HCV packaging cells. These cells encapsidate various HCV replicons with high efficiency, reaching infectivity titers up to 106 tissue culture infectious doses 50 per milliliter. The produced particles display a buoyant density comparable to HCVcc particles and can be propagated in the packaging cell line but support only a single-round infection in naïve cells. Together, this work demonstrates that subgenomic HCV replicons are assembly competent, thus excluding cis-acting RNA elements in the core-to-NS 2 genomic region essential for RNA packaging. The experimental system described here should be helpful to decipher the mechanisms of HCV assembly and to identify RNA elements and viral proteins involved in particle formation. Similar to other vector systems of plus-strand RNA viruses, HCVTCP may prove valuable for gene delivery or vaccination approaches...|$|R

To identify host factors that might affect other key steps in AAV infection, we screened an siRNA library that revealed several candidate genes including the PHD finger-like domain protein 5 A (PHF 5 A), a U 2 snRNP-associated protein. Disruption of PHF 5 A expression selectively enhanced trans-gene expression from AAV by increasing transcript levels and appears to influence a step after second-strand synthesis in a serotype and cell type-independent manner. Genetic dis-ruption of U 2 snRNP and associated proteins, such as SF 3 B 1 and U 2 AF 1, also increased expression from AAV vector, suggesting the critical role of U 2 snRNP spliceosome complex in this host-mediated restriction.

Helper-Dependent (HD) Ads have been proposed as alternative vectors for gene therapy and vaccine development because they have an improved safety profile. To evaluate the potential of HD-Ad vaccines, we compared replication-competent (RC), first-generation (FG) and HD vectors for their ability to induce immune responses in mice. We show that RC-Ad 5 and HD-Ad 5 vectors generate stronger immune responses than FG-Ad 5 vectors. HD-Ad 5 vectors gave lower side effects than RC or FG-Ad, producing lower levels of tissue damage and anti-Ad T cell responses.

SatBaMV is a commonly found satRNA associated with Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) that infects diverse bamboo species in the field.

We found 3 distinct clades among the seven populations. Clade I is consisted of all satBaMV isolates, except for those from Dendrocalamus latiflorus in Taiwan and Bambusa vulgaris in India, which belong to Clades II and III, respectively. Interestingly, nucleotide diversity was lower for Clade I than II and III. However, the nucleotide diversity {{did not seem to}} depend on bamboo species or geographic location. Our population genetic analyses revealed the presence of excessive low-frequency polymorphic sites, which suggests that the satBaMV population was under purifying selection and/or population expansion. Further analysis of P 20, the only satBaMV gene that encodes a non-structural protein involved in the long-distance movement of satBaMV, showed evidence of purifying selection.
