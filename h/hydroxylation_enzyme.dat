40|$|Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit sollten &# 945;- bzw. &# 946;-Ionon durch selektive Hydroxylierung mittels Mikroorganismen zu 3 -Hydroxyiononen umgesetzt werden, um einen Baustein für die chemisch-enzymatische Synthese von Astaxanthin und Zeaxanthin zu liefern. Über 200 Streptomyceten-Stämme wurden auf ihre Fähigkeit hin untersucht, &# 946;- und/oder &# 945;-Ionon regio- und stereoselektiv zu den jeweiligen 3 -Hydroxy-Derivaten umzusetzen. Mit &# 946;-Ionon als Substrat zeigten 19 Stämme Umsetzung zu 4 -Hydroxy- und nicht zum gewünschten 3 -Hydroxy-&# 946;-ionon. Unter diesen 19 Stämmen setzten sechs &# 945;-Ionon zu 3 -Hydroxy-&# 945;-ionon um. S. fradiae Tü 27 zeigte mit 75 % die größte Umsatzrate. Aufgrund von GC- und NMR-Daten konnte gezeigt werden, daß die Hydroxylierung von racemischem &# 945;-Ionon [(6 R) -(-) / (6 S) -(+) ] nur die Bildung der zwei Enantiomere (3 R, 6 R) - und (3 S, 6 S) -Hydroxy-&# 945;-ionon ergab. Die enzymatische Hydroxylierung von &# 945;-Ionon durch die getesteten Streptomyceten-Stämme findet sowohl mit einer hohen Regio- als auch mit einer hohen Stereoselektivität statt. Um die Gene, die für diese Hydroxylase kodieren, zu isolieren, wurden P 450 -Genfragmente aus S. fradiae Tü 27 amplifiziert und sequenziert. Hier konnten zwei P 450 Genfragmente identifiziert werden. Die Isolierung der vollständigen P 450 -homologen Gene mit unterschiedlichen Methoden gelang jedoch nicht. Um nun eine Aussage darüber treffen zu können, ob eines der beiden P 450 -Genfragmente aus dem Stamm Streptomyces fradiae Tü 27 die Hydroxylase kodiert, die die selektive Hydroxylierung des &# 945;-Ionons katalysiert, wurden die P 450 homologen Gene durch Integrationsmutagenese inaktiviert. Die Mutanten wurden für die Umsetzung von &# 945;-Ionon eingesetzt. Während mit der Integrationsmutante GMP 450 - 27 Q eine Umsetzung zu 3 -Hydroxy-&# 945;-ionon stattfand, allerdings mit Nebenprodukt, konnte mit GMP 450 - 27 P keine selektive Hydroxylierung zu 3 -Hydroxy-&# 945;-ionon nachgewiesen werden. Somit scheint P 450 - 27 P für die selektive Hydroxylierung von &# 945;-Ionon verantwortlich zu sein. The aim of {{this work}} was the {{selective}} conversion of &# 945;- and/or &# 946;-ionone to 3 -hydroxy ionones by microbial transformation. These 3 -hydroxy ionones could supply valuable intermediates for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of astaxanthin and zeaxanthin. More than 200 Streptomyces strains were screened for their capacity to regio- and stereoselectively hydroxylate &# 946;- and/or &# 945;-ionone to the respective 3 -hydroxy derivatives. With &# 946;-ionone as the substrate, 19 strains showed conversion to 4 -hydroxy- and none showed conversion to the 3 -hydroxy-&# 946;-ionone as desired. Among these 19 strains six converted &# 945;-ionone to 3 -hydroxy-&# 945;-ionone. S. fradiae Tü 27 showed the highest hydroxylation activity (75). GLC and NMR analyses clearly established that hydroxylation of racemic &# 945;-ionone [(6 R) -(-) /(6 S) -(+) ] resulted in the exclusive formation of only the two enantiomers (3 R, 6 R) - and (3 S, 6 S) -hydroxy-&# 945;-ionone. Thus, the enzymatic hydroxylation of &# 945;-ionone by the Streptomyces strains tested proceeds with both high regio- and stereoselectivity. For {{the isolation of the}} gene encoding oforthis <b>hydroxylation</b> <b>enzyme,</b> P 450 gene fragments of three strains were amplified and sequenced. Two gene fragments from S. fradiae Tü 27 were identified but the isolation of the whole gene by different methods did not succeed. The two P 450 homologous genes of the strain S. fradiae Tü 27 were interrupted by integrationmutagenesis, to identify the P 450 gene fragment encoding for the hydroxylase which is responsible for the selective hydroxylation of &# 945;-ionone. With these mutants the biotransformation of &# 945;-ionone was tested. Whereas the mutant GMP 450 - 27 Q was capable to convert &# 945;-ionone to 3 -hydroxy-&# 945;-ionone, although with by-product, the mutant GMP 450 - 27 P &# 945;-ionone could not selectively convert &# 945;-ionone to 3 -hydroxy-&# 945;-ionone. Therefore, P 450 - 27 P seems to be responsible for the selective hydroxylation of &# 945;-ionone...|$|E
40|$|Nonlyphenols (NP) are {{becoming}} one of the most ubiquitous contaminants in U. S. waterways. NP was previsouly shown to increase the incidence while decreasing the latency of breast cancer in FVB/NJ MMTV neu mice. During these breast cancer studies, P 450 induction was measured. We therefore sought to determine cytochrome P 450 induction by NP in wild-type FVB/NJ mice; however, in our pilot study with male mice we saw nominal induction of P 450 s by Quantitative Real-Time PCR (Q-PCR), and downregulation of the Cyp 3 a subfamily by Western blot. Basal sexual dimorphic expression of P 450 s in mice and rats was previsouly published. The first aim {{of this study was to}} determine if FVB/NJ mice had sexual dimorphic expression of P 450 s measured in other mouse strains, and to determine the sexual dimorphic induction of P 450 s by NP. Mice treated with honey vehicle control, 25 mg/kg/day (males only), 50 mg/kg/day, or 75 mg/kg/day NP, or 100 μg/kg/day estradiol (E 2) (females only) for one week. No significant P 450 induction was measured at 25 mg/kg/day or with 100 ug/kg/day estradiol, suggesting the threshold for P 450 induction by NP in vivo is greater than 25 mg/kg, and P 450 alterations were not due to NP 2 ̆ 7 s estrogenicity. Eight of the ten P 450 s were female predominant, and sexual dimorphic induction of P 450 s by NP treatment was measured. These results were confirmed by Western blot and testosterone <b>hydroxylation</b> <b>enzyme</b> assays. Higher basal/induction of P 450 s in females, resulted in increased Zoxazolamine (ZOX) paralysis and decreased survival of ZOX-challenged males mice. The preferential induction of the Cyp 2 b subfamily compared to the Cyp 3 a subfamily, induction of Cyp 2 b 10 in both sexes, and v the decreased paralysis time in males and females by TCPOBOP (a known CAR-agonist), suggested activation of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). The second aim of this study was to determine whether NP can activate mouse and human CAR. Luciferase reporter assays utilizing HepG 2 cells, a liver cancer cell line, was used to determine NP activation of mouse CAR (mCAR) in vitro. NP activated mCAR at 1 μM, and was able to overcome androstanol inhibition of CAR’s basal activity; on the other hand human CAR (hCAR) assays were inconclusive. Wild-type (BL 6129) and CAR-null mice were treated with honey vehicle control, 50 mg/kg/day, 75 mg/kg/day NP, or 3 mg/kg TCPOBOP. Cyp 2 b 10, the biomarker for CAR activation, was induced in a CAR-dependent manner by NP measured by Q-PCR and Western blot. These results suggest NP activates mCAR in vivo. Cyp 2 b 10 induction by NP was measured by Q-PCR and Western blot in transgenic human CAR mice. Induction of CYP 2 B 6, the only CYP 2 B isoform expressed in humans, was measured in primary human hepatocytes from three donors. The induction of Cyp 2 b 10 in humanized mice and primary hepatocytes suggested NP activates hCAR in vivo. We determined NP activates mouse and human CAR, and causes sexual dimorphic induction of P 450 s. The final aim of this study was to determine CAR’s role in the maintenance of basal sexual dimorphic expression and induction of P 450 s by NP. Male and female wild-type (B 6129) and CAR-null mice were treated as previsouly described in aim two. Basal P 450 expression in this mouse strain was similar to FVB/NJ mice, though female P 450 expression was stunted in the BL 6129 strain. The BL 6129 strain mimiced human P 450 sexual dimorphic patterns, as the P 450 s measured are female predominant but not at the exaggerated levels seen in rats and FVB/NJ mice. CAR regulated the expression of Cyp 2 b 13 and Cyp 2 c 29 in male mice, while Cyp 2 b 10 and Cyp 2 c 29 were regulated in females to a lesser degree. NP induced Cyp 2 b 10, Cyp 2 c 29, and Cyp 3 a 11 in a CAR-mediated female specific vi manner; however TCPOBOP induced these P 450 s in both males and females. TCPOBOP and NP exhibited similar P 450 induction profiles in females but differed in males, suggesting a differential sensitivity of males to weak or moderate CAR activators such as NP. The ubiquitous environmental estrogen, NP, altered P 450 s in male and female mice, activated mouse and human CAR, and the sexual dimorphic sensitivity to NP is mediated in part through CAR. We hypothesize that NP exposure may have enocrine-independent effects mediated through the pregnane X receptor (PXR) and CAR in the liver. These results suggesr drug-drug interactions and decreased pharmaceutical efficacy could be more prevelant in women exposed to NP and other CAR partial agonists. Men may respond poorly to toxicant insult due to lower basal P 450 expression and P 450 induction of genes transcriptionally regulated by CAR. Two possible mechanisms for decreased sensitivity in men could be lower CAR expression, previsouly observed in male mice, and increased levels of androgens which repress CAR basal activity.

Our {{results showed that}} indole degradation was achieved in 28 days by a methanogenic consortium and 35 days by a sulfate-reducing consortium. During degradation under both conditions, two intermediates were isolated, purified and identified as oxindole and isatin (indole- 2, 3 -dione) suggesting that both methanogenic and sulfate-reducing bacteria use an identical degradation pathway. Degradation processes followed two steps of oxidation accomplished by hydroxylation and then dehydrogenation at 2 - and then 3 -position sequentially prior to the cleavage of the pyrrole ring between 2 - and 3 -positions. However, none of 1 -methylindole or 2 -methylindole was degraded under any conditions. 3 -Methylindole (3 -methyl- 1 H-indole, skatole) was transformed under methanogenic conditions and mineralized only under sulfate-reducing conditions.

Enzyme activity was optimal at 35 degrees C and pH 6. 8 - 8. 0. Under these conditions the mono-oxygenase exhibited an apparent Km for ecdysone of 7. 1 X 10 (- 7) M, a maximal specific activity of 1. 1 nmol/h per mg of protein and was competitively inhibited by 20 -hydroxyecdysone with an apparent Ki of 6. 3 X 10 (- 7) M. Enzyme activity was decreased {{in the presence of}} Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, EDTA and non-ionic detergents. The Malpighian tubule ecdysone 20 -mono-oxygenase was localized primarily in the subcellular fraction sedimenting at 7500 g and, on the basis of marker enzyme profiles, was assigned mainly to the mitochondria. NADPH was required for activity, although addition of NADH together with NADPH had a synergistic effect. NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 42) and an energy-dependent NAD(P) transhydrogenase (EC 1. 6. 1. 1.) appeared to be the major sources of reducing equivalents, with the contribution from the 'malic enzyme' (EC 1. 1. 1. 40) being less important. The monooxygenase was characterized as a cytochrome P- 450 -containing mixed-function oxidase from the inhibition patterns with metyrapone, CO and cyanide; CO inhibition was reversible with monochromatic light at 450 nm. However, the ecdysone 20 -mono-oxygenase shows much lower sensitivity to CO inhibition and to photodissociation of the CO-inhibited complex than do vertebrate cytochrome P- 450 -dependent hydroxylation systems.

The reaction appears to have broad substrate specificity; 1 -octyl, 2 -octyl, cyclohexyl, and cumyl hydroperoxides are all reduced at sig-nificant rates. The reduction of alkyl hydroperoxides is inhibited by cyanide, as is the hydroxylation of alkanes and fatty acids in the same enzyme system supplemented with the w-hydroxylase. Previous studies in this laboratory have shown that alkanes (1, 2) and fatty acids (3, 4) undergo <b>hydroxylation</b> in <b>enzyme</b> preparations of Pseudomonas oleovorans according to the equation: RCH 3 f DPNH + H+ + 02 +RCH 20 H + DPN+ + H 20.

Immuno-inhibition studies with an anti-peptide antibody against bovine CYP 3 A 4 confirmed the predominant role of CYP 3 A in testosterone hydroxylation in bovine liver, proving the usefulness of anti-peptide antibodies in defining the contribution of specific P 450 isoforms in drug metabolism in veterinary species...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{degradation}} of phenol, p-cresol, and m- and p-toluate by Alcaligenes eutrophus 345 has provided evidence that these compounds are metabolized via separate catechol meta-cleavage pathways. Analysis of the enzymes synthesized by wild-type and mutant strains and by strains cured of the plasmid pRA 1000, which encodes m- and p-toluate degradation, indicated that two or more isofunctional enzymes mediated several steps in the pathway. The formation of three catechol 2, 3 -oxygenases and two 2 -hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolases was indicated from {{an examination of the}} ratio of the specific activities of these enzymes against various substrates. Evidence for two 2 -hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenases, two 4 -oxalocrotonate isomerases and decarboxylases, and three 2 -ketopent- 4 -enoate hydratases was derived from the induction of these enzymes under different growth conditions. Each activity was detected when the wild type was grown in the presence of m-toluate, but not when grown with phenol (except for a hydratase) or p-cresol, whereas in strains cured of pRA 1000, growth with phenol or p-cresol, but not with m-toluate, induced these <b>enzymes.</b> <b>Hydroxylation</b> of phenol and p-cresol appears to be mediated by the same enzyme...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis {{was made of}} the effectiveness of three methods for the reconstitution of microsomal electron-transfer chains, namely, self-assembly, incorporation of electron carriers into liposomes (non-specific template) and incorporation into `ghosts' of microsomal vesicles (specific template). It was shown that when the `ghosts' of the microsomal vesicles were used as a specific template extra cytochrome b 5 and NADH-specific flavoprotein were incorporated into them, but cytochrome P- 450 and NADPH-specific flavoprotein were not incorporated into the membrane. As a result of the self-assembly and incorporation into liposomes all the electron carriers were present in the reconstituted membrane. Cytochrome P- 450 reactivation took place and the inactive form, cytochrome P- 420, was converted into the active form, cytochrome P- 450. Of the four <b>enzyme</b> <b>hydroxylation</b> systems studied, i. e. NADPH- and NADH-dependent p-hydroxylation of aniline, and NADPH- and NADH-dependent N-demethylation of dimethylaniline, only the NADH-dependent demethylation of dimethylaniline (60 % of the initial value) and NADH-dependent p-hydroxylation of aniline (30 % of the initial value) were reconstituted by self-assembly. NADPH oxidase and NADH oxidase activities were only properly reconstituted by self-assembly and incorporation into liposomes. In contrast, the NADPH-specific system of peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids was reconstituted by specific template-binding...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of aliphatic hydroxylation by cytochromes P 450 {{has been the}} subject of intense debate with several proposed mechanistic alternatives. Various cyclopropyl containing compounds (radical clocks), which can produce both unrearranged and ring opened products upon oxidation, have been key tools in these investigations. In this study, we introduce several cyclopropyl containing fatty acids 1 a- 4 a with which to probe the {{mechanism of}} P 450 s capable of fatty acid hydroxylation. The probes are shown to be capable of distinguishing radical from cationic intermediates due to the rapid equilibration of isomeric cyclopropyl cations. Ring opening of a radical intermediate in an oxidative transformation is expected to yield a single rearranged alcohol, whereas a cation isomerizes prior to ring opening, leading to two isomeric homoallylic alcohols. Oxidation of these probes by P 450 (BM 3) and P 450 (Biol) gives results consistent with a radical but not a cationic intermediate in fatty acid <b>hydroxylation</b> by these <b>enzymes.</b> Quantitation of the unrearranged and ring opened products gives remarkably homogeneous rates for oxygen rebound of (2 - 3) x 10 (10) s(- 1). The effects of introduction of a cyclopropane ring into a fatty acid upon the regiochemistry of hydroxylation are discussed...|$|R
30|$|Total {{polyphenols}} content (Table  2) {{was higher}} in open field grown seeds {{than in the}} greenhouse ones (301 vs. 254  mg g− 1 d.w., respectively). Moreover, polyphenols were more concentrated in the seeds obtained with {{the first and the}} second transplant (317  mg g− 1 d.w. as an average), whereas no significant differences were observed in the later cycles (250  mg g− 1 d.w. as an average). Notably, in our research, the seed polyphenols contents displayed opposite trends to the ones recorded for proteins and they fell in the range reported by [37]. These compounds reportedly show a positive correlation with the antioxidant activity [10, 38], whereas the correlation with temperature is controversial, as it resulted positive in banana and tomato [39, 40] but adverse in lettuce and watermelon [39, 41]. Phenylalanine ammonium-lyase (PAL) is considered the main enzyme in the phenyl-propanoid building pathway, catalyzing the l-phenylalanine turning into trans-cinnamic acid, which is the intermediate compound in phenolic biosynthesis [42]. This enzyme activity increases in response to thermal stress and it {{is considered one of the}} main cell acclimation symptoms against stress [43]. On the other hand, phenol oxidation is performed either by peroxidases (POD) or priority by polyphenols oxidases (PPO); the latter enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of o-diphenols to o-diquinons, as well as monophenols <b>hydroxylation</b> [44]. Both <b>enzymes</b> have been associated with physiological damage caused by thermal stress and, in fact, under high or low temperature stress these enzymes are activated, whereas the enzymes oxidizing the same compounds are inhibited [43, 44]. Accordingly, soluble phenolic compounds can accumulate as a mechanism of acclimation to overcome high or low temperature stress [39].|$|R
40|$|The {{aromatic}} {{amino acid}} hydroxylases phenylalanine hydroxylase (PheH), tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrH) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TrpH) utilize tetrahydropterin and molecular oxygen to catalyze aromatic <b>hydroxylation.</b> All three <b>enzymes</b> have similar active sites and contain an iron atom facially coordinated by two histidines and a glutamate. The three enzymes also catalyze the benzylic hydroxylation of 4 - methylphenylalanine. The intrinsic primary and ?-secondary isotope effects for benzylic hydroxylation and their temperature dependences are nearly identical {{for the three}} enzymes, suggesting that the transition states, the tunneling contributions and the reactivities of the iron centers are the same. When molecular oxygen and the tetrahydropterin are replaced by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), these <b>enzymes</b> catalyze the <b>hydroxylation</b> of phenylalanine to form tyrosine and meta-tyrosine with nearly identical second order rate constants. When the H 2 O 2 -dependent reaction is carried out with cyclohexylalanine or 4 -methylphenylalanine, the products are 4 -HO-cyclohexylalanine and 4 -hydroxymethylphenylalanine, respectively. These experiments provide further evidence that the intrinsic reactivities of the iron centers in these enzymes are the same. Wild-type PheH and the uncoupled mutant protein V 379 D exhibit normal and inverse isotope effects, respectively, with deuterated phenylalanines. When the reaction is monitored by stopped-flow absorbance spectroscopy, three steps are visible. The first step is the reversible binding of O 2, the second step is 5 - 7 fold faster than the turnover number, setting a limiting value for the rate constant for O 2 activation, and the last step is non-enzymatic. There is no burst in the pre-steady state formation of tyrosine. These {{results are consistent with}} formation of the new C-O bond to form tyrosine as the ratelimiting step of the reaction. The reaction of TrpH with both tryptophan and phenylalanine was studied by stopped-flow absorbance spectroscopy and rapid-quench product analysis. With either amino acid as substrate, four steps can be distinguished. The first step is the reversible binding of O 2 to the Fe(II) center; this results in an absorbance signature with a maximum at 420 nm. This O 2 complex decays with a rate constant that is 18 - 22 fold faster than the turnover number with either amino acid, setting a the lower limit for the rate constant for O 2 activation. The rate constant for the third step agrees well with the pre-steady state of formation of 5 -hydroxytryptophan or tyrosine from rapid-quench product analysis. The rate constant for the fourth step agrees well with the turnover number. Overall, these results show that O 2 activation is fast and turnover with each amino acid is limited by hydroxylation and release of a product, with the former step being about 4 -fold faster than the latter...|$|R
40|$|Cytochrome P 450 2 E 1 (CYP 2 E 1) is a {{mammalian}} {{member of}} the large P 450 gene superfamily. CYP 2 E 1 is active in the metabolism of many small hydrophobic substrates, including general anesthetics, muscle relaxants, precarcinogens, and organic solvents. CYP 2 E 1 is, however, active also in acetone <b>hydroxylation</b> and the <b>enzyme</b> is specifically regulated during conditions of fasting and during diabetic states, {{as well as by}} insulin. The pathway initiated by CYP 2 E 1 by acetone hydroxylation may contribute up to 10 % of gluconeogenetic demands. CYP 2 E 1 is further characterized by a pronounced oxidase activity, and can generate substantial amounts of oxygen free radicals. It was hypothesized that CYP 2 E 1 could contribute to oxygen toxicity during hyperoxia. Exposure of rats to 95 % oxygen, originally a model for Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome, lead to a 4 -fold induction of CYP 2 E 1 in liver and lung. A concomitant increase in NADPH dependent superoxide anion and H 202 generation was seen. In addition, pretreatment of rats with the CYP 2 E 1 inducer acetone aggravated the peroxidation of lipids, and decreased the survival time during hyperoxia. Next, we investigated the potential expression of CYP 2 E 1 in the rat central nervous system, and found the enzyme to be present in distinct groups of neurons and glial cells. CYP 2 E 1 mRNA and catalytic activity was detected, and CYP 2 E 1 could be induced 4 -fold by a low concentration of ethanol (25 mM) in cultured glial cells. Interestingly, the centrally acting muscle relaxant chlorzoxazone was oxidized with a Km of ~ 25 myM, which is lower than plasma concentrations of the drug (~ 60 myM) in humans. It was concluded that CYP 2 E 1 substrates may be metabolically activated in situ in the brain Following ischemic or mechanical brain injury, CYP 2 E 1 was induced in astrocytes in vivo, in the inflammatory phase. Addition of lipopolysaccharide or interleukin- 1 beta induced CYP 2 E 1 up to 7 -fold in cultured astrocytes. The induction was accompanied by an increase of CYP 2 E 1 mRNA, an unusual mode of induction for this enzyme. Because inflammatory factors are very potent down regulators of hepatic CYP 2 E 1, and P 450 s in general, the induction in astrocytes is tissue specific. This is, to my knowledge, the first example of such differential regulation among the drug-metabolizing P 450 s. Chlormethiazoie, an inhibitor of hepatic CYP 2 E 1 transcription and a potent neuroprotective agent, inhibited the CYP 2 E 1 induction jn astrocytes with an IC 50 of 5 myM. Phorbol ester was also found to be an inducer in astrocytes, but probably acted by stimulating differentiation. Since both phorbol ester and lipopolysaccharide stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in astrocytes, and both agents induced CYP 2 E 1 in a way that could be inhibited by genistein, it is suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation is a necessary step during induction. It is concluded that CYP 2 E 1 is inducible and active during inflammatory states in the lung and the brain and that CYP 2 E 1 is subject to pronounced tissue specificity in the regulation by interleukins. It is suggested that CYP 2 E 1 may be of importance for local energy provision in astrocytes, especially during inflammation...|$|R
