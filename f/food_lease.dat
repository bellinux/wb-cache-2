50|$|By 1949, John Sexton & Co. was {{operating}} branch warehouses in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Long Island City, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Territories {{served by a}} Sexton salesman, but too remote from a Sexton branch warehouse, received rail shipments directly from Chicago. The majority of Sexton manufacturing was still done at the Chicago facility. However, the chemical manufacturing plant had moved to Philadelphia. The coffee roasting and spice blending operations had moved to Pittsburgh. In 1950, Sexton Quality <b>Foods</b> <b>leased</b> a 130000 sq ft warehouse in San Francisco to support the established west coast sales force and to expand into California, Oregon and Washington.|$|R

After {{the loss of his}} wife, he and the management team thought that it was time that the convenience store chain is in for a change. In 2001, Minit Mart <b>Foods</b> <b>leased</b> its operations to Clark Retail, retaining ownership of the assets. In addition to Clark’s original 600 stores, that company also acquired several other chains in the Midwestern United States, mainly in Indiana and Illinois, growing to approximately 1,200 stores. Competition, however, was intense during that time, and Clark eventually ended up in bankruptcy. After filing for bankruptcy, Clark returned 37 stores to Minit Mart Foods Inc.|$|R

Sexton had outgrown the State Street location, so moved the company four blocks west {{to the corner of}} Lake and Franklin Streets (236 W. Lake Street). In 1908, Sexton Quality <b>Foods</b> <b>leased</b> the entire six-story building for a term of 10 years that expired April 1918. Prior to moving in, electric service and elevators were installed. A side note in Chicago real estate history, in 1885, J.B. Clow & Sons, a cast iron pipe manufacturer entered into a 99-year ground lease with landowner John Peacock at a rate of $3,000 per year with 4% annual increases. That same year, J.B. Clow & Sons constructed a six-story office building. In 1908, J.B. Clow & Sons relocated to a larger building at Harrison and the River and leased the building to John Sexton & Co. By 1909, John Peacock's widow sold the ground to George L. Thatcher for $173,000. John Sexton & Co. organized the building into sales, warehouse, manufacturing and laboratory. At the new location, Sexton expanded into the manufacture of pickles, relishes, spices and preserves. Company horses were stabled at a livery one mile west of the building.|$|R
50|$|The City of Chicago {{provided}} a start-up grant, and Strube Celery and Vegetable Company donated warehouse space. The Food Depository distributed 471,000 pounds of food from 22 food donors to 85 agencies {{in its first}} year of operation. The food bank’s supply grew when Illinois legislators passed a Good Samaritan law in 1981. The legislation protected food contributors from legal liabilities (Congress passed national legislation in 1996). Within a year food donors increased to 111, distribution to 6.1 million pounds and agencies to 375, and the <b>Food</b> Depository <b>leased</b> a more spacious warehouse.

50|$|Ayres {{encountered}} several {{challenges in}} establishing and operating the new discount store concept. First, Ayres needed {{to define a}} clear brand identity for the new subsidiary {{and its relationship to}} the L. S. Ayres store brand. Second, errors in selection of store locations posed challenges. Ayres built discount stores in areas of economic decline or in locations that were not yet sufficiently developed. Finally, Ayres's efforts to establish supermarkets adjacent to its discount stores proved unsuccessful. In fiscal year 1970, two years after their initial introduction, the Ayr-Way <b>food</b> stores, <b>leased</b> and operated by Scot-Lad Foods of Chicago, caused Ayres an after-tax loss of $320,000. Ayres sold its food stores to Scot-Lad Foods in 1970 and concentrated on Ayr-Way's general merchandise.|$|R
50|$|The farmer {{produces}} 1,500 <b>food</b> on land <b>leased</b> {{from the}} landlord. Of that 1,500, he retains 600 food to feed himself, his livestock, and any laborers he hires. He sells the remaining 900 {{in the market}} for $1 per unit of food. He keeps $300 ($150 for himself, $150 for his laborer) to buy non-farm goods (clothes, household goods, etc.) from the merchants and artisans. This produces $600 of net profit, to which Quesnay refers as product net.|$|R

On April 17, 2013, the Pirates and Cumberland County announced a five-year lease, with the option for another five years, {{to stay at the}} Cross Insurance Arena in Portland, though that was thrown into question due to a dispute over revenue from <b>food</b> sales (see <b>lease</b> dispute section below). Due to the dispute, the Pirates played their entire 2013-14 home schedule in Lewiston.|$|R
50|$|U.S. investors {{account for}} {{nearly two-thirds of the}} foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) in Honduras. The stock of U.S. direct investment in Honduras in 2005 was $402 million, up from $339 million in 2004. The overall flow of FDI into Honduras in 2005 totaled $568 million, $196 million of which was spent in the maquila sector. The United States continued as the largest contributor of FDI.

5000|$|With Weisfield's {{continuing}} {{to own the}} properties that Fred Meyer leased, this kept grocery sections leased to Associated Grocers (where Valu-Mart had a grocery section within the store). Most were converted into Mark-it Foods. A no frills discount store popular in the 1970s that allowed the customers to mark their own prices with a grease pencil as well as bag their own groceries. Stores also contained automotive repair sections which served as Good Year Tire Stores as well. The restaurants and beauty salons continued to keep their leases and operate as independent businesses that operated within the stores even after the Fred Meyer conversion (until Kroger acquired Fred Meyer and purchased the Valu-Mart properties). Some of the restaurants were converted to Eve's (Fred Meyer's dining brand) after the conversion. Some <b>food</b> departments were <b>leased</b> to Fred Meyer later on as remodeling happened in the late 1970s (with {{the exception of the}} Burien and Greenwood locations).|$|R
40|$|With {{over half}} of the world’s {{population}} living in urban settlements and an ongoing urbanization, cities today offer a unique opportunity to tackle climate change. Emissions of greenhouse gases derive from all products and services used, and in Sweden the average inhabitant emit 7 tons of greenhouse gases in carbon dioxide equivalents every year from privately acquired products and services, calculated from a consumption perspective. Long-term climate goals, and international climate agreements sets a limit of 1 - 2 tons. Lifestyle changes are important to achieve sustainable development, but planning practices today generally do not try to influence citizens’ consumption, and is presumed cannot affect inhabitants’ consumption of food, clothes, electronics, furniture, etc.   This thesis investigates how planning and the built environment can practically encourage more sustainable consumption patterns, and which of these practices would be suitable to implement in the current sustainability project of Norra Kymlinge. The study concludes that sustainable consumption patterns could be encouraged in Norra Kymlinge through: collaborative living, sharing infrastructure, green <b>leases,</b> <b>food</b> production, personal measurement, and semi self-built apartments. For future research, more quantitative studies on the topic are suggested. ...|$|R
5000|$|The San Diego Unified Port District {{was created}} in 1962 after the California State {{legislature}} passed Senate Bill 41 and the San Diego County Board of Supervisors certified it. The citizens, in 1964, approved a $10.9 million bond for capital improvements. Improvements included {{the development of a}} new air terminal, preparation for Harbor Island to be leased, and construction of a new cargo terminal in National City. In 1970, the first cruise ship to offer scheduled cruises out of San Diego, since the creation of the Port, began making 10-day trips to Mexico. In 1980, the Port in an effort to improve the ecological balance of the Bay completed a wildlife refuge in Chula Vista. In 1983, The San Diego Cruise Industry Consortium was formed to promote San Diego as a cruise destination and homeport. Then just three years later the B Street Pier Cruise Ship Terminal was officially dedicated. That same year, over 26,000 passengers embarked and disembarked at the terminal. In 1989, the Port-funded, $165 million, waterfront San Diego Convention Center opened. In 1990, The Pasha Group began importing vehicles (Isuzus) at the National City Marine Terminal. A total of 15,589 vehicle units were imported the first year. Pasha now imports over 400,000 vehicles annually. In 1993, the Port and Tenth Avenue Cold Storage Company celebrated the grand opening of San Diego's first on-dock cold storage facility, built for $11 million, at the Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal.
