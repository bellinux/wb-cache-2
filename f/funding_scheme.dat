Construction was expected to take six years, but a start date and <b>funding</b> <b>scheme</b> were never announced. The MBTA ultimately decided not to complete the design work necessary to build the Red/Blue Connector, as funding for constructing it {{was seen as an}} impossibility. The possibility of a public-private partnership (P3) to advance the project was studied in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Why {{does the}} Court not apply this clear law to these clear facts, and conclude, as I do, that the <b>funding</b> <b>scheme</b> {{here is a}} clear {{constitutional}} violation? The answer must be, in part, that the Court fails to confront the evidence {{set out in the}} preceding section. Throughout its opinion, the Court refers uniformly to Wide Awakes Christian viewpoint or its religious perspective, and in distinguishing funding of Wide Awake from the funding of a church, the Court maintains that Wide Awake is not a religious institution, at least in the usual sense. The Court does not quote the magazine's adoption of Saint Paul's exhortation to awaken to the nearness of salvation, or any of its articles enjoining readers to accept Jesus Christ, or the religious verses, or the religious textual analyses, or the suggested prayers. And so, it is easy for the Court to lose sight of what the University students and the Court of Appeals found so obvious, and to blanch the patently and frankly evangelistic character of the magazine by unrevealing allusions to religious points of view.|$|E

The Mandatory Provident <b>Fund</b> <b>Schemes</b> Authority (MPFA), up and running in September 2000, is charged with supervising the provision of MPF schemes - it registers schemes and ensures that approved trustees administer schemes prudently. The MPFA have powers to ensure compliance, including the ability to conduct inspections, audits and investigations, and also to impose sanction on a trustee in the event of breaches of the legislation.|$|R

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Chichen Itza project, Morley {{came across}} the {{drawings}} of a young artist and draftsperson, Tatiana Proskouriakoff, who as an unpaid excavator had accompanied a 1936–37 University of Pennsylvania Museum expedition to the Maya site of Piedras Negras. The quality of her reconstructive panorama drawings (depicting what the site [...] "might have looked like" [...] when in use) so impressed Morley that he determined to enroll her onto the Carnegie staff. However, this {{was in the midst of}} the Great Depression and funds for hiring were scarce; it was also not clear whether Morley had the appropriate authority to do so. After several entreaties, Morley again came up with an innovative <b>funding</b> <b>scheme</b> whereby he devised two campaigns to raise money by subscription to send Proskouriakoff to Copán and the Yucatán. These were successful, and in 1939, Proskouriakoff transferred onto the Carnegie payroll and was duly dispatched to Copán to gather data for reconstructive drawings of that site. Morley's support of Proskouriakoff was to prove fortuitous to Maya scholarship, as she went on to a lengthy and successful career with the Carnegie Institution and was lauded as one of the foremost Maya scholars of her time.|$|E
2500|$|Debate on a <b>funding</b> <b>scheme</b> {{turned in}} part {{on the issue of the}} pension. [...] Twice the nationalists urged the body to adopt a {{commuted}} pension scheme (one that would end after a fixed time, rather than lifetime), but it was rejected both times. [...] After the second rejection on February 4, a plot to further raise tensions began to take shape. [...] Four days later, Colonel Brooks was dispatched back to Newburgh with instructions to gain the army leadership's agreement with the proposed nationalist plan. [...] The army leadership was also urged by Gouverneur Morris to use its influence with state legislatures to secure their approval for needed changes. [...] On February 12, McDougall sent a letter (signed with the pseudonym Brutus) to General Knox suggesting that the army might have to mutiny by refusing to disband until it was paid. [...] He specifically told Knox to not make any direct steps, but that he should [...] "not lose a moment preparing for events." [...] Historian Richard Kohn is of the opinion that the purpose of these communications was not to foment a coup or military action against Congress or the states, but to use the specter of a recalcitrant army's refusal to disband as a political weapon against the antinationalists. [...] The nationalists were also aware of a significant cadre of lower-level officers who were unhappy with General Washington's leadership and had gravitated to the camp of Major General Horatio Gates, a longtime Washington rival. [...] These officers, Kohn believes, could be used by the nationalists to stage something that resembled a coup if necessary.|$|E
