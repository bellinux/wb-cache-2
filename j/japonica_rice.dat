Borlaug's colleagues at the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research also developed and introduced a high-yield variety of rice throughout most of Asia. Land devoted to the semi-dwarf wheat and rice varieties in Asia expanded from 200acres (0.8km²) in 1965 to over 40 million acres (160,000km²) in 1970. In 1970, this land accounted for over 10% of the more productive cereal land in Asia.|$|E
25|$|Morphological {{studies of}} rice phytoliths from the Diaotonghuan archaeological site clearly show the {{transition}} from the collection of wild rice to the cultivation of domesticated rice. The large number of wild rice phytoliths at the Diaotonghuan level dating from 12,000–11,000 BP indicates that wild rice collection was part of the local means of subsistence. Changes in the morphology of Diaotonghuan phytoliths dating from 10,000–8,000 BP show that rice had by this time been domesticated. Soon afterwards the two major varieties of indica and <b>japonica</b> <b>rice</b> were being grown in Central China. In the late 3rd millennium BC, there was a rapid expansion of rice cultivation into mainland Southeast Asia and westwards across India and Nepal.|$|E
30|$|The genetic {{diversity}} of six starch biosynthetic genes (Wx, SSI, SSIIa, SBEI, SBEIIa and SBEIIb) in indica and <b>japonica</b> <b>rices</b> opens {{an opportunity to}} produce a new variety with more favourable grain starch quality. However, there is limited information {{about the effects of}} these six gene allele combinations on starch structure and properties.

5000|$|Mochi is a {{multicomponent}} food {{consisting of}} polysaccharides, lipids, protein and water. Mochi has a heterogeneous structure of amylopectin gel, starch grains, and air bubbles. [...] This rice {{is characterized by}} its lack of amylose in the starch and is derived from short or medium <b>japonica</b> <b>rices.</b> The protein concentration of the rice is {{higher than that of}} normal short-grain rice, and the two also differ in amylose content. In mochi rice, the amylose content is negligible, which results in its gel-like consistency.|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{the quality}} of foreign <b>japonica</b> <b>rices</b> was {{evaluated}} in terms of prices relative to Japanese domestic retail prices. Then, retail prices, consumer benefit, and competitiveness among the foreign rices in the Japanese market were estimated assuming those rices were imported at prices based on their production and transportation costs. According to the results, rices produced in China are quite superior to rices grown in the United States. Further, a 700 percent of tariff, which was discussed in the GATT negotiation and assumed to be imposed on rices imported to Japan, appears to be too low for Chinese rices and too high for American rices.

40|$|There are two {{cultivated}} and twenty-one {{wild species}} of genus Oryza. O. sativa, the Asian cultivated rice is grown {{all over the}} world. The African cultivated rice, O. glaberrima is grown {{on a small scale}} in West Africa. The genus Oryza probably originated about 130 million years ago in Gondwanaland and different species got distributed into different continents with the breakup of Gondwanaland. The cultivated species originated from a common ancestor with AA genome. Perennial and annual ancestors of O. sativa are O. rufipogon and O. nivara and those of O. glaberrima are O. longistaminata, O. breviligulata and O. glaberrima probably domesticated in Niger river delta. Varieties of O. sativa are classified into six groups on the basis of genetic affinity. Widely known indica rices correspond to group I and japonicas to group VI. The so called javanica rices also belong to group VI and are designated as tropical japonicas in contrast to temperate japonicas grown in temperate climate. Indica and <b>japonica</b> <b>rices</b> had a polyphyletic origin. Indicas were probably domesticated in the foothills of Himalayas in Eastern India and japonicas somewhere in South China. The indica rices dispersed throughout the tropics and subtropics from India. The <b>japonica</b> <b>rices</b> moved northward from South China and became the temperate ecotype. They also moved southward to Southeast Asia and from there to West Africa and Brazil and became tropical ecotype. Rice is now grown between 55 N and 36 S latitudes.

40|$|The {{improvement}} of rice eating quality {{is a very}} important direction of rice breeding. Clearing the different genotype of rice eating quality provides the basis for the parent selection on breeding good eating quality rice. Using molecular marker detection technology, g enotypes of ten genes related to eating quality of 22 Shanghai important rice varieties,including conventional rice and hybrid parents were detected. The results showed that "Zixiangnuo 861 " rice contained many poor genotypes which might affect rice eating quality.

30|$|We {{have shown}} that for most {{domestication}} genes, the most primitive Formosan landraces contain the same sequence changes as many known modern cultivars. Both early japonica and indica accessions have exactly the same haplotypes for the loss-of-function sh 4, prog 1 and lg 1 genes. This fits very well with the hypothesis of a single de novo domestication followed by transfer of domestication genes between rice subpopulations through introgression (Choi et al. 2017; Choi and Purugganan 2018). However, {{it should be noted}} that there are two haplotypes for each of the two awn-related genes. For an 1, the early and modern japonica accessions have the TE-insertion type and four out of five indica accessions have a 1 -bp deletion. As to an 2, 9 out of 10 japonica accessions have a 29 -bp insertion while all 5 indica accessions have both a 29 -bp insertion and a 1 -bp deletion. To conclude, our study shows that the first rice landraces introduced to Taiwan thousands of years ago were domesticated <b>japonica</b> <b>rices.</b> They were neither wild nor domesticated de novo from wild rice.|$|R
50|$|Many crop cultivars show strong {{allelopathic}} properties, {{of which}} rice (Oryza sativa) {{has been most}} studied.

5000|$|Rice {{production}} {{is important to}} the food supply, with rice being a staple part of the Japanese diet. Japan is the ninth largest producer of rice in the world. The rice seasons in Northern Japan last from May-June to September-October. In central Japan, it is from April-May to August-October. In southern Japan the rice season is from April -May to August-September. About 85% of the 2.3 million farms in Japan plant rice yearly. Improved varieties of <b>japonica</b> <b>rice</b> are grown in almost all prefectures in the country. The most widely planted variety is Koshihikari.|$|E
30|$|All japonica accessions {{fall within}} a single cluster, colored in two {{different}} shades of red in Fig.  3. Accessions colored in lighter red include modern temperate <b>japonica</b> <b>rices</b> such as Nipponbare from Japan and TC 194, TNG 67 and TNG 72 from Taiwan; traditional temperate japonicas from Japan such as Kameji, Mansaka and Shinriki; and traditional Formosan accessions such as Nakabo, Purahaitairin, Muteka, Nakairitsu, Chuan No 4, Matara, Kabotsumame, Bohai, Montana and Rui Yan Shiang Mi. The traditional japonica landraces from the Philippines and Indonesia, generally classified as tropical japonica, occur in a single subcluster, colored in dark red. The awnless Formosan landrace Montana also occurs in that subcluster. It is still unclear whether the Formosan japonica landraces should be classified as temperate, tropical, or intermediate, but it is relevant to note that six Formosan japonica landraces forming a subcluster in Fig.  3 : Muteka, Nakairitsu, Chuan No 4, Matara, Kabotsumame, and Bohai, have markedly primitive characteristics: in particular relatively long awns (2 – 6  cm) and a relatively high degree of shattering. Moreover, the nested position of the tropical subcluster within the broader japonica cluster suggests that the tropical japonicas of the Philippines and Indonesia arose as an adaptation of temperate or Formosan japonicas to tropical conditions, rather than the reverse. Specifically, Fig.  3 suggests that certain Formosan japonica landraces like Rui Yan Shiang Mi are intermediate between Formosan japonicas and the tropical japonicas of the Philippines and Indonesia. This makes good linguistic sense since all the languages of the Philippines and Indonesia belong to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family, and Malayo-Polynesians are believed on linguistic and archaeological grounds to have expanded south of Taiwan in a single sea-borne migration c. 4000 BP. Under the phylogeny in Fig.  3, the first Malayo-Polynesian-speaking rice farmers travelled south with the japonica varieties cultivated in southern Taiwan c. 4000 BP: these included one landrace ancestral to Rui Yan Shiang Mi and to the tropical japonicas of the Philippines and Indonesia. That variety proved especially successful in the new environment, giving rise to the modern tropical <b>japonica</b> <b>rices</b> of the Philippines and Indonesia. We expect that if more japonica landraces from other Austronesian-speaking areas, such as Madagascar, were subjected to phylogenetic analysis, they would fall into the same tropical japonica subcluster.|$|R

40|$|The {{population}} structure of domesticated species {{is influenced by}} the natural history of the populations of predomesticated ancestors, {{as well as by the}} breeding system and complexity of the breeding practices exercised by humans. Within Oryza sativa, there is an ancient and well-established divergence between the two major subspecies, indica and japonica, but finer levels of genetic structure are suggested by the breeding history. In this study, a sample of 234 accessions of rice was genotyped at 169 nuclear SSRs and two chloroplast loci. The data were analyzed to resolve the genetic structure and to interpret the evolutionary relationships between groups. Five distinct groups were detected, corresponding to indica, aus, aromatic, temperate japonica, and tropical <b>japonica</b> <b>rices.</b> Nuclear and chloroplast data support a closer evolutionary relationship between the indica and the aus and among the tropical japonica, temperate japonica, and aromatic groups. Group differences can be explained through contrasting demographic histories. With the availability of rice genome sequence, coupled with a large collection of publicly available genetic resources, it is of interest to develop a population-based framework for the molecular analysis of diversity in O. sativa...|$|R

30|$|We have {{recently}} argued, {{contrary to the}} prevailing current opinion, that rice was only domesticated once [76]. This was based primarily on the following facts that: (1) the two main rice varietal groups, indica and japonica, have the same major allele for non-shattering [37]; (2) the absence of archaeobotanical evidence for two areas of domestication [16]; (3) the lack of evidence to support wild rice with indica- and japonica-like characteristics occurring in different geographic regions [61]; and (4) evidence that indica and <b>japonica</b> domesticated <b>rice</b> have the same time span since domestication [8].|$|R
