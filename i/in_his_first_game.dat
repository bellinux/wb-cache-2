5|$|Before the 2007 season, Alston {{competed with}} Ron Warner and Jabari Issa for a {{starting}} {{role on the}} Eskimos. He made the active roster and originally split time with Warner and Robert Brown as a defensive lineman. In August, Alston replaced Adam Braidwood as the starting defensive end, but he was injured with a hip pointer <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>game</b> in that role. He experienced nagging injury concerns {{for the remainder of}} the season. He finished the season with 11 tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble over six games. The Eskimos released Alston shortly after the end of the 2007. Head coach Danny Maciocia cited Alston's history of injuries as a factor in his release from the team.|$|E

Bure returned that season to appear in 39 games, managing 19 goals and 30 points.|$|E
5|$|Chu {{made his}} debut as a {{contestant}} on the January 28, 2014, episode of Jeopardy!, winning $37,200 <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>game.</b> On the January 29 episode, Chu made a Final Jeopardy! wager that {{caused him to}} tie fellow contestant Carolyn Collins. Chu claimed that he {{made the decision to}} wager for a tie not out of kindness but because of the advice of 2003 College champion Keith Williams, who claims that game theory favors wagering for a tie over the more common practice of wagering to win by a dollar. Chu defeated Collins on the January 30 episode.|$|E
