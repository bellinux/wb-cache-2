40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate the <b>horizontal</b> <b>pressures</b> on a cylindrical metal silo of corrugated walls and flat bottom with 1. 82 m diameter and 5. 4 m high, and to compare the values with those obtained theoretically by the ISO 11697, EP 433 and AS 3774 standards. The silo was symmetrically filled and constant speed with wheat cv. soft red for two different height/diameter ratios (H/D) and was unloaded through three orifices with a diameter of 71. 6 mm, one concentric and two eccentrics. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>pressures</b> were measured {{on the walls of the}} silo at three positions using hydraulic type pressure cells.

This has a negative effect on dams and subsequently their power stations, particularly those on rivers or within catchment areas with high siltation. Siltation can fill a reservoir and reduce its capacity to control floods along with causing additional <b>horizontal</b> <b>pressure</b> on the upstream portion of the dam.

25|$|In a {{barotropic}} atmosphere, where {{density is}} a function only of pressure, a <b>horizontal</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient will drive a geostrophic wind that is constant with height. However, if a horizontal temperature gradient exists along isobars, the isobars will be thicker. This causes {{the slope of the}} isobars to increase with height. This is illustrated in panel (b) of the figure to the left. Because isobars are steeper at higher elevations, the associated pressure gradient force is stronger there. However, the Coriolis force is the same, so the resulting geostrophic wind at higher elevations must be greater {{in the direction of the}} pressure force.|$|E

At the top of Mount Everest, the atmospheric pressure is approximately 0.333 atm, so by using the graph, the boiling point of Diethyl ether would be approximately 7.5°C versus 34.6°C at sea level (1 atm).|$|E

Since the problem is indeterminate, a number of potential failure surfaces must be analysed to identify the critical failure surface (i.e. the surface that produces the maximum or minimum thrust on the wall). Mayniel (1908) later extended Coulomb's equations to account for wall friction, symbolized by δ.

25|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{is the change}} in the {{amplitude}} or sign of the geostrophic wind due to a horizontal temperature gradient. The geostrophic wind is an idealized wind that results from a balance of forces along a horizontal dimension. Whenever the Earth's rotation plays a dominant role in fluid dynamics, as in the mid-latitudes, a balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure-gradient force develops. Intuitively, a horizontal difference in pressure pushes air across that difference in a similar way that the horizontal difference in the height of a hill causes objects to roll downhill. However, the Coriolis force intervenes and nudges the air towards the right (in the northern hemisphere). This is illustrated in panel (a) of the figure below. The balance that develops between these two forces results in a flow that parallels the <b>horizontal</b> <b>pressure</b> difference, or pressure gradient. In addition, when forces acting in the vertical dimension are dominated by the vertical pressure-gradient force and the gravitational force, hydrostatic balance occurs.|$|E
500|$|Surface {{temperature}} {{differences in}} turn cause pressure differences. A hot surface warms {{the air above}} it causing it to expand and lower the density and the resulting surface air pressure. The resulting <b>horizontal</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient moves the air from higher to lower pressure regions, creating a wind, and the Earth's rotation then causes deflection of this air flow due to the Coriolis effect. The simple systems thus formed can then display emergent behaviour to produce more complex systems and thus other weather phenomena. [...] Large scale examples include the Hadley cell while a smaller scale example would be coastal breezes.|$|E
60|$|There is {{one more}} very curious {{circumstance}} illustrative of the Venetian desire to obtain <b>horizontal</b> <b>pressure.</b> In all the Gothic staircases with which I am acquainted, out of Venice, in which vertical shafts are used to support an inclined line, those shafts are connected by arches rising each above the other, with a little bracket above the capitals, on the side where {{it is necessary to}} raise the arch; or else, though less gracefully, with a longer curve to the lowest side of the arch.|$|E

60|$|The reader must {{observe that}} the great {{sturdiness}} of {{the form of the}} bars, 5, 9, 17, 24, 25, is a consequence of the peculiar office of Venetian traceries in supporting the mass of the building above, already noticed in Vol. II.; and indeed the forms of the Venetian Gothic are, in many other ways, influenced by the difficulty of obtaining stability on sandy foundations. One thing is especially noticeable in all their arrangements of traceries; namely, the endeavor to obtain equal and <b>horizontal</b> <b>pressure</b> along the whole breadth of the building, not the divided and local pressures of Northern Gothic. This object is considerably aided by the structure of the balconies, which are of great service in knitting the shafts together, forming complete tie-beams of marble, as well as a kind of rivets, at their bases. For instance, at b, Fig. II., is represented the masonry of the base of the upper arcade of the Ducal Palace, showing the root of one of its main shafts, with the binding balconies. The solid stones which form the foundation are much broader than the balcony shafts, so that the socketed arrangement is not seen: it is shown as it would appear in a longitudinal section. The balconies are not let into the circular shafts, but fitted to their circular curves, so as to grasp them, and riveted with metal; and the bars of stone which form the tops of the balconies are of great strength and depth, the small trefoiled arches being cut out of them as in Fig. III., so as hardly to diminish their binding power. In the lighter independent balconies they are often cut deeper; but in all cases the bar of stone is nearly independent of the small shafts placed beneath it, and would stand firm though these were removed, as at a, Fig. II., supported either by the main shafts of the traceries, or by its own small pilasters with semi-shafts at their sides, of the plan d, Fig. II., in a continuous balcony, and e at the angle of one.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{includes the}} three major parts of the study: volume change, and lateral earth pressure due to suction change in expansive clay soils, and design of civil infrastructure drilled pier, retaining wall and pavement in expansive soils. The volume change model in expansive clay has been refined to reinforce realistic characteristics of swelling and shrinkage behavior of expansive clay soils. Refinements include more realistic design soil suction versus depth profiles and improved characterizations {{of the effects of}} soil cracking, overburden stress, and lateral earth pressure. The refined model also includes an algorithm of assigning suctionvolumetric water content curves and diffusivity through the soil. The typical lateral earth pressure distribution during wetting against a stationary wall is proposed. The proposed stationary retaining wall-soil system in expansive soils includes an upper movement active zone and a lower anchor zone. Mohr? s circles and failure envelopes are used to define the effective horizontal stress and shear failure in an unsaturated soil. The prediction of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>pressures</b> due to suction change in a soil is compared with the in situ measurement of natural <b>horizontal</b> <b>pressures</b> and the measurements from the large scale tests. It is found that agreement between the measured and predicted <b>horizontal</b> <b>pressures</b> is satisfactory. Case studies of axial and bending of the pier are presented with both uniform and non-uniform wetting. The pier case study for axial behavior shows a good agreement with a heave at ground surface and uplift forces. Three case studies for bending behavior of the pier and retaining wall are presented based on suction change. Pavement design program has been refined to extend the design capabilities into both flexible and rigid pavements supported by pavement treatments. The comparative case studies using both current and new methods in pavement design show that the current method criterion of 1 -inch is unnecessarily conservative. Furthermore, the current method does not provide a means of anticipating subgrade shrinkage that will result in longitudinal cracking {{along the edge of the}} pavement. The design calculations with both methods lead to the conclusion that neither the swelling movement, as in the current method, nor the total movement, as in the new method, is a reliable indicator of likely acceptable pavement performance. Instead, all of these case studies show that it is important to use the predicted history of the present serviceability index and the international roughness index as the proper design guideline for an acceptable treatment of the subgrade of an expansive soil...|$|R

Basic conclusion: (1) the subsoil vibrations cause two types of changes of the horizontal pressures: stable changes which are observed when the model vibrations finish and cyclic of short duration (brief) changes; (2) the subsoil vibrations either generate stable increase or stable decrease of the pressures from before vibrations or do not generate any essential stable change; (3) the cyclic dynamic changes of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>pressures</b> depend on the direction of the silo wall displacements and they are the function of the values of these displacements...|$|R
