50|$|Hansgrohe SE is a German {{sanitary}} fittings manufacturer. It {{was founded by}} Hans Grohe in 1901, in Schiltach, Germany. Hansgrohe {{is one of the}} world’s largest shower head, <b>hand</b> <b>shower</b> and faucet suppliers, next to competitors such as Grohe and KOHLER. Principal shareholder is the Masco Corporation, Taylor, Michigan, United States.|$|E
50|$|Hansgrohe has {{registered}} about 2500 patents {{until the}} end of 2015. Among the most important inventions are: automatical drainage systems (1934), the wallbar (1953), the <b>hand</b> <b>shower</b> with an adjustable water jet (1968), the kitchen faucet with pull-out handspray (1984) as well as technologies to reduce the waterflow through air addition (2004) and activating / deactivating the water flow with a push-button (2011). In 2015, Hansgrohe held 24 patents, 180 designs and 93 brands.|$|E

After the whole team (except Geoff) visit Turtle Island Recycling in Toronto's Port Lands to find recycled wood for their framing needs, Geoff is noticeably unimpressed; very few 2x4 wood was found, and the rest had to be milled into 2x4s. A round of slim pickings by Gordie and Michelle on the second day leads Geoff to commission the junk hotline, which yields immediate results: a tip from a home which had recently torn out their bathroom has given the team the bathroom sink and tub they need, though Michelle is critical of the [...] "baby bathing station" [...] and the <b>hand</b> <b>shower.</b> In the end, thanks to Cam and Ross, the framing is complete, and none of the money is spent.|$|E

30|$|Radar {{images have}} been used for {{precipitation}} nowcasting. Different techniques are based on correlation of successive images [8], on tracking the centroid of an object [9], and on the use of numerical prediction of wind advection [10]. Classical optical flow methods can estimate the motion of objects comparing a couple of subsequent images [11, 12]. Some multi-frame techniques have also been introduced, in order to enhance robustness to noise and improve the discriminating capabilities of the algorithm [13, 14]. When applied to precipitation forecasting [15, 16], optical flow techniques track rainfall objects assuming that they remain constant in intensity (brightness constancy condition). On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>shower</b> clouds and the fine structure of stratiform rain bands can develop in a few minutes [17]. Their identification is not possible with classical optical flow techniques and their prediction is very difficult and requires detailed local information (which could be detected with X-band radars).|$|E
40|$|Between March and May 2006, a Texas {{hospital}} identified five Mycobacterium mucogenicum bloodstream infections among hospitalized oncology patients using fluorescence high-performance {{liquid chromatography}} analysis of mycolic acids. Isolates from blood cultures were compared to 16 isolates from environmental sites or water associated with this ward. These isolates were further characterized by hsp 65, 16 S rRNA, and rpoB gene sequencing, hsp 65 PCR restriction analysis, and molecular typing methods, including repetitive element PCR, random amplified polymorphic DNA PCR, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of large restriction fragments. Three of five patient isolates were confirmed as M. mucogenicum and were in a single cluster as determined by all identification and typing methods. The remaining two patient isolates were identified as different strains of Mycobacterium phocaicum by rpoB sequence analysis. One of these matched an environmental isolate from a swab of a <b>hand</b> <b>shower</b> in the patient's room, while none of the clinical isolates of M. mucogenicum matched environmental strains. Among the other 15 environmental isolates, 11 were identified as M. mucogenicum and 4 as M. phocaicum strains, {{all of which were}} unrelated by typing methods. Although the 16 S rRNA gene sequences matched for all 14 M. mucogenicum isolates, there were two each of the hsp 65 and rpoB sequevars, seven PCR typing patterns, and 12 PFGE patterns. Among the seven M. phocaicum isolates were three 16 S rRNA sequevars, two hsp 65 sequevars, two rpoB sequevars, six PCR typing patterns, and six PFGE patterns. This outbreak represents the first case of catheter-associated bacteremia caused by M. phocaicum and the first report of clinical isolates from a U. S. hospital. The investigation highlights important differences in the available typing methods for mycobacteria and demonstrates the genetic diversity of these organisms even within narrow confines of time and space...|$|E

50|$|To {{reduce the}} itching, an {{application}} of anti-itch cream containing hydrocortisone, calamine, or benzyl benzoate is often used (though calamine has been shown not to be effective). Hydrogen peroxide and capsaicin cream has also been effective. Another good way to relieve itching is to apply heat—either by using a <b>hand</b> held <b>shower</b> with water hot as one can stand, or by heating the bite with a hair dryer. The heat method will relieve itching for about four hours and will require repeating.|$|R

An integrative literature review was performed using six databases in June 2013. The descriptors AIDS and Hygiene were used, in Portuguese, English or Spanish. A total of 682 articles were found and 16 were selected. Personal hygiene practices were identified, such as <b>hand</b> washing, <b>showers,</b> tooth brushing and quitting smoking. Food hygiene practices involved washing food and kitchen utensils, using treated water, conserving and cooking food. Environmental hygiene took into account raising domestic animals, control of disease vectors, household cleanliness, waste disposal and basic sanitation. In conclusion, these specific hygiene interventions can be applied to the general population and, especially, to people with HIV/AIDS, due to immunosuppression...|$|R

30|$|For {{the elderly}} who live {{independently}} {{in their own}} residence, home service robots can play as a social companion to collaborate and interact with the elderly. One important communication channel in human daily life is the sound, which includes voice and non-voice. Therefore, it is desirable to equip home service robots with sound processing capability. The robot needs {{to know where the}} sound sources are located even when multiple sound sources exist. This can help the robots respond to human commands and events more accurately. Furthermore, it is very important for the home service robots to understand the sound events that are generated by human’s daily activities such as cooking, drinking, washing <b>hands,</b> having <b>shower,</b> using a toilet, sounds associated with anomalous behaviours such as falling on the floor. Sound event recognition helps the robot not only monitor elderly’s activities but also detect anomalies happening in their home. Such a human-aware capability frees the robot to do its daily routine work, while being {{able to take care of}} the elderly more proactively and effectively.|$|R
30|$|Similarly, {{in order}} to {{evaluate}} autonomous sound event classification, two speakers simultaneously played the voice sound and the event sound. The SNRs between the event sound and the voice sound are approximately 0, 3, 6, and 9  dB. We tested the SVM-based SER with 20 classes of sound events (boiling water, frying fries, making coffee, washing dishes, teapot whistle, filling water glass, washing hands, brushing teeth, soaping <b>hands,</b> having <b>shower,</b> washing machine, flushing toilet, drying hair, eating snack, glass dropping, door opening, yawning, coughing, laughing, others). The average accuracy rates of sound event recognition with respect to SNRs are shown in Fig.  14. In the first experiment, clean event sounds in the ASCC SoundLib were used as the training data. The testing results without sound separation are very poor with average accuracy rates below 60  %. In the second experiment, the results are better when the sound separation is applied. These separated event sounds are labelled by the human and then used for training in the third experiment. The results are improved significantly.|$|R
5000|$|Sharpe was {{described}} {{in at least three}} books by former wrestling personalities; Dynamite Kid, Hulk Hogan and Gary Michael Cappetta, and by longtime WWF wrestler/commentator Gorilla Monsoon, as having shown characteristics of obsessive-compulsive disorder, as evidenced by a preoccupation with cleanliness that caused him to spend hours washing his <b>hands</b> or <b>showering</b> at arenas and meticulously folding and re-folding his clothing. According to Cappetta, Sharpe's behavior earned him the nickname [...] "Mr. Clean" [...] among his co-workers. At a televised house show in the Boston Garden in March 1986, Monsoon even joked to fellow commentator Lord Alfred Hayes that Sharpe had the first match of the night at a previous Boston show, and was still in the showers when they locked up later that night forcing him {{to spend the night in}} the arena. During his WWF career, many of their commentators also noted that other than his obsessive cleaning, Sharpe was also obsessed with physical fitness and that if he wasn't in the ring or in the showers, he would be working out.|$|R

40|$|A new {{wastewater}} {{recovery system}} has been developed that combines novel biological and physicochemical components for recycling wastewater on long duration human space missions. Functionally, this Alternative Water Processor (AWP) would replace the Urine Processing Assembly on the International Space Station and reduce or {{eliminate the need for}} the multi-filtration beds of the Water Processing Assembly (WPA). At its center are two unique game changing technologies: 1) a biological water processor (BWP) to mineralize organic forms of carbon and nitrogen and 2) an advanced membrane processor (Forward Osmosis Secondary Treatment) for removal of solids and inorganic ions. The AWP is designed for recycling larger quantities of wastewater from multiple sources expected during future exploration missions, including urine, hygiene (<b>hand</b> wash, <b>shower,</b> oral and shave) and laundry. The BWP utilizes a single-stage membrane-aerated biological reactor for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification. The Forward Osmosis Secondary Treatment (FOST) system uses a combination of forward osmosis (FO) and reverse osmosis (RO), is resistant to biofouling and can easily tolerate wastewaters high in non-volatile organics and solids associated with <b>shower</b> and/or <b>hand</b> washing. The BWP has been operated continuously for over 300 days. After startup, the mature biological system averaged 85 % organic carbon removal and 44 % nitrogen removal, close to stoichiometric maximum based on available carbon. To date, the FOST has averaged 93 % water recovery, with a maximum of 98 %. If the wastewater is slighty acidified, ammonia rejection is optimal. This paper will provide a description of the technology and summarize results from ground-based testing using real wastewate...|$|R

(Word had got around quickly that an Orthodox priest was to visit the area.) Seraphim and Makarii stayed in the mill from dawn to dusk, confessing the sinners. Negrich also arrived from his school. Negrich and I had never made any effort to hear confessions, and Father Makarii was glad of this, since it gave him {{an opportunity to make}} a few dollars from the confessors. Father Makarii was very tight with a penny, and constantly speculated where he could get a free meal. He had a hearty appetite, nor was he one to ‘toss a drink over his shoulder’, and so with both <b>hands</b> he <b>showered</b> blessings on all people, good and bad, while whispering quotations from the Bible. The Bishop’s service began with Negrich’s and my assistance. It was natural that my mill would have to be cleansed of evil spirits, and therefore the mill had to be consecrated, which Seraphim did, precisely according to the Missal. However, as Seraphim knew all the ritual by heart, he did not even glance at the Missal. Father Makarii, glad that Seraphim did not call on him to assist with the service, stationed himself behind the altar, where he munched noisily on wafers, drinking them down with wine. During the service, Bachinsky’s choir from Ethelbert sang, with fine cantors participating.” ...|$|R
40|$|The Hyperfiltration Wash Water Recovery (HWWR) subsystem, {{designed}} to offer low-power high-volume wash water purification for extended mission spacecraft, {{is discussed in}} terms of preprototype design and configuration. Heated wash water collected from the <b>shower,</b> <b>hand</b> wash, and laundry flows into a temperature-controlled (374 K) waste storage tank. Two parallel 25 micron absolute filters at the tank outlet remove large particles from the feed stream. A positive displacement feed pump delivers wash water to the hyperfiltration module at a constant flow rate of 0. 20 lpm with discharge pressure variations from 4181 - 7239 Kpa. The hyperfiltration membrane module is a single-pass design including 36 porous stainless steel tubes, and is {{designed to}} provide an approximate water recovery rate of 90 percent. Permeate and brine water flows are monitored by flow meters, and removal of urea and ammonia is achieved by adding 15 percent NaOCl solution to the permeate fluid stream.

60|$|If (argued I to myself) this unnatural {{custom of}} theirs be a sin {{offensive}} to Heaven, {{it belongs to}} the Divine Being, who alone has the vindictive power in his <b>hands,</b> to <b>shower</b> down his vengeance upon them. And perhaps he does so, in making them become one another's executioners. Or, if not, if God thinks these doings just, according to the knowledge they conceive, what authority have I to pretend to thwart the decrees of Providence, which has permitted these actions for so many ages, perhaps from almost the beginning of the creation? They never offended me, what right have I then to concern myself in their shedding one another's blood: And, indeed, I have since known, they value no more to kill and devour a captive taken in war, than we do to kill an ox or eat mutton. I then concluded it necessarily followed, that these people were no more murderers than Christians, who many times put whole troops to the sword, after throwing down their arms.--Again I considered, that if I fell upon them, I should be as much in the wrong as the Spaniards, who had committed the greatest barbarities upon these people who had never offended them in their whole lives; as if the kingdom of Spain was eminent for a race of men without common compassion to the miserable, a principal sign of the most generous temper: these considerations made me pause, and made me think I had taken wrong measures in my resolution: I now argued with myself, it was better for me never to attack, but to remain undiscovered as long as I possibly could; that an opposite conduct would certainly prove destructive; for as it was scarcely to be supposed I could kill them all, I might either be overpowered by the remaining, or that some escaping, might bring thousands to my certain destruction. And, indeed, religion took their part so much as to convince me how contrary it was to my duty to be guilty of shedding human blood, innocent as to my particular, whatever they are to one another: that I {{had nothing to do with}} it, but leave it to the God of all power and dominion, as I said before, to do therein what seemed convenient to his heavenly wisdom. And, therefore, on my knees I thanked the Almighty for delivering me from blood guiltiness, and begged his protection that I might never fall into their hands.|$|R
