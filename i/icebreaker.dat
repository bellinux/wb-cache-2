5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Jupiter served with the Channel Fleet {{and then as a}} guard ship on the River Tyne. She was dispatched to Russia in February 1915 to serve as an <b>icebreaker,</b> clearing a route to Arkhangelsk while the regular <b>icebreaker</b> was undergoing a refit. She underwent her own refit later in 1915 and once completed, was transferred to the Suez Canal Patrol. She returned to England late 1916, and spent the remainder of the war based at Devonport. She was scrapped in 1920.|$|E
5|$|On 6 March, Bismarck {{received}} {{the order to}} steam to Kiel. On the way, the ship was escorted by several Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters {{and a pair of}} armed merchant vessels, along with an <b>icebreaker.</b> At 08:45 on 8 March, Bismarck briefly ran aground on the southern shore of the Kiel Canal; she was freed within an hour. The ship reached Kiel the following day, where her crew stocked ammunition, fuel, and other supplies and applied a coat of dazzle paint to camouflage her. British bombers attacked the harbour without success on 12 March. On 17 March, the old battleship , now used as an <b>icebreaker,</b> escorted Bismarck through the ice to Gotenhafen, where the latter continued combat readiness training.|$|E
5|$|The first ship {{to reach}} Pine Island Glacier's ice shelf, in Pine Island Bay, was the USS/USCGC Glacier in 1985. This ship was an <b>icebreaker</b> {{operated}} by the U.S. Coast Guard. The mission, known as Deep Freeze, had scientists on board who took sediment samples from the ocean floor.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the first}} {{diesel-electric}} <b>icebreakers</b> {{were built in}} the 1930s, <b>icebreakers</b> were either coal- or oil-fired steam ships. Reciprocating steam engines were preferred in <b>icebreakers</b> due to their reliability, robustness, good torque characteristics, and ability to reverse the direction of rotation quickly. During the steam era, the most powerful pre-war steam-powered <b>icebreakers</b> had a propulsion power of about [...]|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, several other countries began to operate purpose-built <b>icebreakers.</b> Most were coastal <b>icebreakers,</b> but Canada, Russia, and later, the Soviet Union, also built several oceangoing <b>icebreakers</b> of around 10,000 ton displacement.|$|R
50|$|<b>Icebreakers</b> keep 23 {{ports open}} for traffic even in winter. The ports in Gulf of Bothnia need <b>icebreakers</b> in average six months a year, while in Gulf of Finland <b>icebreakers</b> {{are needed for}} three months a year.|$|R
5|$|Hessen was recommissioned on 1 April 1937 {{and served}} in the Kriegsmarine through World War II. On 31 March 1940, Hessen acted as an <b>icebreaker</b> for the {{auxiliary}} cruisers , , and , on their trip from Kiel to the North Sea. She and her control ship, Blitz, were ceded to the Soviet Union in 1946. She recommissioned on 3 June 1946 as Tsel, and continued to operate as a target ship until scrapped in 1960.|$|E
5|$|The {{operational}} {{plan called for}} strict radio silence to ensure surprise could be maintained. This required Meendsen-Bohlken to have total tactical and operational control of his ship; shore-based commands {{would be unable to}} direct the mission. On 16 August, Admiral Scheer and her destroyer escort left Narvik on a course to pass to the north of Novaya Zemlya. Upon entering the Kara Sea, she encountered heavy ice; in addition to searching for merchant shipping, the Arado floatplane was used to scout paths through the ice fields. On 25 August, she encountered the Soviet <b>icebreaker</b> Sibiryakov. Admiral Scheer sank the <b>icebreaker,</b> but not before she sent a distress signal. The German ship then turned south, and two days later, arrived off the port of Dikson. Admiral Scheer damaged two ships in the port and shelled harbor facilities. Meendsen-Bohlken considered sending a landing party ashore, but firing from Soviet shore batteries convinced him to abandon the plan. After breaking off the bombardment, Meendsen-Bohlken decided to return to Narvik. She reached port on 30 August without having achieved any significant successes.|$|E
5|$|Hessen {{was one of}} the few {{obsolete}} battleships Germany {{was permitted}} to retain under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. She served as a coastal defense ship in the 1920s and early 1930s, though she was withdrawn from front-line service in 1934. The following year, the ship was converted into a radio-controlled target. During World War II Hessen served in this capacity, while also working as an <b>icebreaker</b> in the Baltic and North Seas. The ship was ceded to the Soviet Union in 1946 after the end of the war and, renamed Tsel, served until scrapped in 1960.|$|E
5000|$|Project 21900 and Project 21900M <b>icebreakers</b> (also {{referred}} as LK-16) are {{a series of}} five Russian <b>icebreakers.</b> Two project 21900 <b>icebreakers</b> (Moskva and Sankt-Peterburg) were built at Baltic Shipyard in Saint Petersburg in 2008 and three project 21900M <b>icebreakers</b> were built at Vyborg Shipyard in Vyborg and at Arctech Helsinki Shipyard in Helsinki. Two of the new vessels (Vladivostok and Murmansk) were entered service in 2015 and the last one (Novorossiysk) in 2016. The construction of the 21900M class <b>icebreakers</b> was conducted under the Federal Target Programme [...] "Development of the Transport System of Russia (2010 - 2015)".|$|R
50|$|The Hope <b>Icebreakers</b> were a Canadian Junior {{ice hockey}} team. They {{played in the}} Pacific International Junior Hockey League {{and the town of}} Hope from the 2003-2008 seasons, after which they were {{approved}} by BC hockey to move to Mission, BC, Canada. They subsequently changed their name to the Mission <b>Icebreakers.</b> The <b>Icebreakers</b> have a Sasquatch logo.|$|R
50|$|Various river <b>icebreakers,</b> from smaller {{vessels to}} nuclear-powered shallow draft <b>icebreakers</b> Taymyr-class Vaygach and Taymyr, {{are also in}} service in the large rivers of the Russian arctic.|$|R
5|$|This {{judgement}} did {{not remove}} {{the potential for}} disputes, as ice could be washed downstream along rivers, resulting in arguments over the ownership of the displaced ice. In some states it was made illegal to damage the uncut ice belonging to another businessman, but arguments could still become nasty. In the winter of 1900–01, for example, disputes between the Pike and North Lake Company and its rival the Wisconsin Lakes Ice and Cartage Company over the rights to harvest ice resulted in pitched battles between workers and the deployment of a steamship <b>icebreaker</b> to smash competing supplies.|$|E
5|$|Four Canadian Navy ships {{headed to}} the Gulf Coast of the United States, {{carrying}} relief supplies {{to help in the}} aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, were slowed down trying to avoid Hurricanes Nate and Ophelia. The convoy included a destroyer, two frigates, and an <b>icebreaker,</b> and developed a plan to travel between the two hurricanes to minimize damage to their cargo. Crews, anticipating potentially rough seas and gusty winds even with the averted course, secured onboard supplies such as generators, chainsaws, diapers, and cots. The genesis of Tropical Storm Nate continued the unprecedented levels of tropical activity during the 2005 hurricane season; when it developed on September5, it was the earliest in any season that the fourteenth named tropical cyclone formed, surpassing the previous record held by an unnamed storm during the 1936 season.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Humble Oil and Refining Company sent a {{specially}} fitted oil tanker, the , {{to test the}} feasibility of transporting oil via ice-breaking tankers to market. The Manhattan was fitted with an ice-breaking bow, powerful engines, and hardened propellers before successfully traveling the Northwest Passage from the Atlantic Ocean to the Beaufort Sea. During the voyage, the ship suffered damage to several of its cargo holds, which flooded with seawater. Wind-blown ice forced the Manhattan to change its intended route from the M'Clure Strait to the smaller Prince of Wales Strait. It was escorted back through the Northwest Passage by a Canadian Coast Guard <b>icebreaker,</b> the CCGS John A. Macdonald. Although the Manhattan transited the Northwest Passage again {{in the summer of}} 1970, the concept was considered too risky. A pipeline was thus the only viable system for transporting the oil to the nearest port free of pack-ice, almost 800 miles (1,300km) away at Valdez.|$|E
50|$|Project 21900 <b>icebreakers</b> Moskva and Sankt-Peterburg are 114 m long {{overall and}} have a moulded breadth of 27.5 m. While Project 21900M <b>icebreakers</b> Vladivostok, Murmansk and Novorossiysk are {{slightly}} longer at 119.8 m, {{they have the same}} beam as well as the same design draught, 8.5 m, which corresponds to a displacement of about 10,000 tons. The general layout of the vessels is somewhat similar, with the largest difference being the helideck, which in Project 21900 <b>icebreakers</b> is located behind the superstructure and in Project 21900M <b>icebreakers</b> on the forecastle.|$|R
25|$|In November 2012, Fennica and {{her sister}} ship became the first Finnish <b>icebreakers</b> to sail through the Northern Sea Route when the vessels {{returned}} to Finland for the 2012 icebreaking season. During the transit, the multipurpose <b>icebreakers</b> were escorted by Russian nuclear-powered <b>icebreakers</b> Rossiya and Vaygach. In 2013, Fennica and Nordica returned to Finland via the Northern Sea Route for the second time.|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} of the Finnish multipurpose <b>icebreakers</b> began in the mid-1980s when the Finnish National Board of Navigation launched a project to find secondary uses for the new vessels it was planning to build {{as a replacement for}} some of the oldest <b>icebreakers.</b> Until then the Finnish <b>icebreakers</b> had been designed solely for escort operations in ice-infested waters and their specialized hull form was not suitable for open water. As a result the existing <b>icebreakers</b> had an effective operational time of only three to five months per year and spent the summer season moored at Katajanokka in Helsinki. A multipurpose application of the new <b>icebreakers</b> would thus result in a better utilization of the vessels and, assuming they were chartered by a commercial third party during the summer, improve the economics of the state-owned fleet.|$|R
5|$|The Siegfried-class {{ships were}} {{obsolete}} by {{the outbreak of}} World War I, and saw only limited service in their intended role before they were withdrawn from active duty. The ships then served {{in a variety of}} secondary duties, including barracks ships, target ships, {{and in the case of}} Beowulf, an <b>icebreaker</b> in the Baltic Sea. All six ships were struck from the naval register on 17 June 1919, days before the Treaty of Versailles was signed. Five of the ships were sold for scrapping immediately after they were struck from the register (with Hildebrand being lost in transit), but Frithjof was purchased by a shipping company, and converted into a freighter. She served in this capacity until she too was scrapped in 1930.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Braunschweigs {{bridge was}} rebuilt and enlarged. The year {{followed}} the same pattern as the previous one, with visits to foreign ports in July; Braunschweig stopped in Helsinki, Finland and Gothenburg, Sweden during her trip. Joint maneuvers were held again in August and September, after which Püllen left the ship. On 15 October, VAdm Hans Zenker, then the Oberbefehlshaber der Seestreitkräfte (O.d.SCommander of Naval Forces), reorganized the fleet structure, disbanding the North Sea and Baltic commands and replacing them with organizations based on ship type. Braunschweig was now assigned to the Linienschiffsdivision (Battleship Division), where she served as Zenker's flagship. The division also included the battleship Hannover. In February and March 1924, the ship served as an <b>icebreaker</b> in the Baltic. The usual cruise abroad in July 1924 ventured further than in previous years, with a trip into the Atlantic. Braunschweig stopped in A Coruña from 6 to 13 July. Fleet maneuvers followed {{at the end of}} August, and at their conclusion, the fleet anchored off Sassnitz for a naval review for Admiral Paul Behncke, the retiring Chef der Admiralität (Chief of the Admiralty). Zenker was promoted to replace Behncke, who was in turn replaced by now-VAdm Mommsen, who again made Braunschweig his flagship. Further exercises were held from 29 September to 5 October.|$|E
5|$|The {{first quarter}} of 1907 {{followed}} the previous pattern and, on 16 February, the Active Battle Fleet was re-designated the High Seas Fleet. From the end of May to early June the fleet went on its summer cruise in the North Sea, returning to the Baltic via the Kattegat. This {{was followed by the}} regular cruise to Norway from 12 July to 10 August. During the autumn maneuvers, which lasted from 26 August to 6 September, the fleet conducted landing exercises in northern Schleswig with the IX Corps. The winter training cruise went into the Kattegat from 22 to 30 November. In May 1908, the fleet went on a major cruise into the Atlantic instead of its normal voyage in the North Sea, which included a stop in Horta in the Azores. The fleet returned to Kiel on 13 August to prepare for the autumn maneuvers, which lasted from 27 August to 7 September. Division exercises in the Baltic immediately followed from 7 to 13 September. In February 1909, Zähringen was employed as an <b>icebreaker</b> for the ports of the western Baltic.|$|E
5000|$|Polar-class <b>icebreakers</b> , [...] {{are heavy}} <b>icebreakers</b> {{operated}} by the United States Coast Guard (USCG). These cutters, specifically designed for icebreaking, have reinforced hulls, special icebreaking bows, and a system that allows rapid shifting of ballast to increase {{the effectiveness of their}} icebreaking. The vessels conduct Arctic and Antarctic research and are the primary <b>icebreakers</b> that clear the channel into McMurdo Station for supply ships. All are homeported in Seattle, Washington.|$|R
50|$|The number, {{type and}} {{location}} of the propellers depends on the power, draft and intended purpose of the vessel. Smaller <b>icebreakers</b> and icebreaking special purpose ships {{may be able to}} do with just one propeller while large polar <b>icebreakers</b> typically need up to three large propellers to absorb all power and deliver enough thrust. Some shallow draught river <b>icebreakers</b> have been built with four propellers in the stern. Nozzles may be used to increase the thrust at lower speeds, but they may become clogged by ice. Until the 1980s, <b>icebreakers</b> operating regularly in ridged ice fields in the Baltic Sea were fitted with first one and later two bow propellers to create a powerful flush along the hull of the vessel. This considerably increased the icebreaking capability of the vessels by reducing the friction between the hull and the ice, and allowed the <b>icebreakers</b> to penetrate thick ice ridges without ramming. However, the bow propellers are not suitable for polar <b>icebreakers</b> operating in the presence of harder multi-year ice and thus have not been used in the Arctic.|$|R
