25|$|Ahmed Bedier’s {{involvement}} in civil liberties began after the September 11 attacks in 2001. The St. Petersburg Times called his mosque {{for a response}} to the attack. Bedier shared his views on what <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a young Muslim in America after 9/11. This led to volunteer work with the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in public relations. In December 2003, when CAIR opened a Tampa office, Bedier became the director.|$|E

Psychiatrist Donald Lunde, who interviewed Kemper at length during adulthood, wrote that with these murders, [...] "In his way, [...] had avenged the rejection of both his father and his mother." [...] Kemper's crimes were deemed incomprehensible for a 15-year-old to commit, and court psychiatrists diagnosed him as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia before sending him to the criminally insane unit of the Atascadero State Hospital.|$|E

500|$|By the 1960s, a {{less severe}} view was being {{taken of the}} Edwardian era. In 1966 the critic Frank Howes wrote that Elgar {{reflected}} the last blaze of opulence, expansiveness and full-blooded life, before World War I swept so much away. In Howes's view, there was a touch of vulgarity in both the era and Elgar's music, but [...] "a composer is entitled to be judged by posterity for his best work. ... Elgar is historically important for giving to English music {{a sense of the}} orchestra, for expressing what <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be alive in the Edwardian age, for conferring on the world at least four unqualified masterpieces, and for thereby restoring England to the comity of musical nations." ...|$|E

It'll be big, it'll probably be one of the bigger Beyoncé music videos ever done. And, I can say that I think the song is unbelievable. The Gaga thing took me by surprise, 'cause I've done videos for probably 15 years, and I had forgotten what <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have a video premiere and have it be anticipated and have it explode. And yeah I hope the same for Beyoncé, but I don't know if that's gonna happen. It is a fantastic song, so I really hope that song catches for her, and I think the video's gonna be really fun and cool and different for her." ...|$|E
500|$|Charlie Jane Anders of io9 {{believed}} that {{some elements of}} the film were deliberate self-references to Michael Bay's own sense of under-appreciation after the backlash to the second film: [...] "After {{a few hours of}} seeing Shia get dissed, overlooked and mistreated, the message becomes clear: Shia, as always, is a stand-in for Michael Bay. And Bay is showing us just what <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> deal with the ocean of Haterade—the snarking, the Razzie Award, the mean reviews—that Revenge of the Fallen unleashed." [...] She {{went on to say that}} the film's frequent, often jarring shifts in tone were an intentional endorsement of Michael Bay's own filmmaking style. [...] "Tone is for single-purpose machines. Consistency is for Decepticons. Michael Bay's ideal movie shifts from action movie to teen comedy to political drama with the same well-lubricated ease that his cars become men. By the time you've finished watching, you will speak Michael Bay's cinematic language." ...|$|E

500|$|After The Game {{signed with}} the G-Unit, he {{recorded}} nine songs with fellow American rapper 50 Cent in his home studio in Farmington, Connecticut, {{and then went back}} to Los Angeles, California to complete the album with American record producer Dr. Dre. While continuing the recording sessions on the album, he began working with rapper and record producer Kanye West on a song, where Kanye did the chorus. However, the song was left on the cutting room floor. The Game also was working on the album for his inspiration goals about reviving what <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be involved in this whole hip hop scene in the West Coast, which was overshadowed over these past few years by these artists between the East to the South. In 2005, in the interview with Vibe magazine, 50 Cent stated that he was brought in by the Interscope Records to work on the album, claiming that {{was on the verge of}} being shelved and The Game was being dropped from the label. However, in the interview with Funkmaster Flex, The Game said that his status was never uncertain that he would be dropped from the label. 50 Cent also claimed that he wrote six songs of The Documentarys eighteen tracks—"Hate It or Love It", [...] "How We Do", [...] "Church for Thugs", [...] "Special", [...] "Higher", and [...] "Westside Story"—and didn't receiving any proper credit for his work. The Game denied those claims, saying that 50 Cent only wrote two songs on the album.|$|E
500|$|After spring {{training}} in 1983, the California Angels assigned McLaughlin to minor league camp in Casa Grande, Arizona. He was eventually {{assigned to the}} Triple-A Edmonton Trappers, but was called up to the majors in June after pitcher Bruce Kison {{was placed on the}} disabled list. McLaughlin made his season debut with the Angels on June 7, against the Chicago White Sox, pitching 1 innings, giving up one earned run. When asked what <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be back in the majors, McLaughlin responded, [...] "I'm just thankful the Angels gave me this an opportunity {{to get back in the}} big leagues [...] I always knew I could pitch but I had been labeled a trouble-maker". McLaughlin commented that the personnel on his previous teams felt he had an attitude problem, but that he did not want that to affect him while playing with the Angels, and that it was [...] "in the past". He picked up his first win of the season on July 1, against the Kansas City Royals. McLaughlin was optioned to the minor leagues in August. After hearing the news, McLaughlin was reportedly furious at the Angels front office staff and even threatened to retire. However, McLaughlin continued to play in the California minor league system, and even returned to the majors in September. In the minors that year, he played for the Triple-A Edmonton Trappers and the Double-A Beaumont Golden Gators, going a combined 5–4 with a 4.26 ERA in 26 games in 96 innings pitched. With the Angels, McLaughlin compiled a 2–4 record with a 5.17 ERA, and 45 strikeouts in 16 games, seven of which were starts.|$|E
500|$|The next day, {{the family}} convinces them to marry while they're in Sitka. [...] After Margaret realizes how close Andrew's family is, she becomes upset, gets on Andrew's boat, and speeds away with him. She tells him {{she has been}} alone since she was sixteen years old after her parents died and had {{forgotten}} what <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have a family. She lets go of the helm and stumbles {{to the back of}} the boat. Andrew makes a sharp turn to avoid hitting a buoy, and Margaret falls out of the boat. Andrew quickly turns the boat around and saves her because she can't swim. At the wedding ceremony, Margaret confesses the truth about the wedding to the guests, including Gilbertson, who informs her she has twenty-four hours to leave for Canada. Margaret returns to the Paxton home to pack her things. Andrew rushes to their room only to find Margaret has already left, leaving the aforementioned book manuscript with a note of praise and a promise to publish it. Gertrude attempts to comfort Andrew and asks approvingly if he is going to go after her. As he rushes out to find Margaret, another argument arises between him and Joe. Annie fakes a heart attack and convinces them to reconcile before she [...] "passes away". After she succeeds in getting things moving again, she owns up to faking the heart attack as it was the only means to get their attention. Andrew's parents realize he really loves Margaret. He goes to New York and tells Margaret he loves her in front of the entire office staff. They kiss, then go to Gilbertson and inform him they are again engaged, but for real this time. The film ends with Gilbertson asking questions (some of them irrelevant) not only to Andrew and Margaret, but also Joe, Grace, Annie and Ramone.|$|E
5000|$|It {{dawned on}} me when I was being fitted for my {{traveling}} uniform that I was about to represent my country. When that hit home {{it was a very}} proud moment in my life.

It wasn't until we all gathered at the airport that I got the real rush of excitement because there I was, this sixteen year-old kid about to take off and play cricket in a strange country, and from what we had been told it would be in conditions like we had never experienced before. We were all excited with the prospect of taking on the South Africans and we had been told about the wickets being bouncy and fast, similar to the WACA strip in Perth.|$|R

She has stated that her parents [...] "raised [...] Jewish {{as much as they}} could," [...] although religion was suppressed in the Soviet Union. On her second day in Los Angeles, Kunis was enrolled at Rosewood Elementary School, not knowing a word of English. She later recalled: [...] "I blocked out second grade completely. I have no recollection of it. I always talk to my mom and my grandma about it. It was because I cried every day. I didn't understand the culture. I didn't understand the people. I didn't understand the language. My first sentence of my essay to get into college was like, 'Imagine being blind and deaf at age seven.'

The Disney film thrilled Groening as a kid, {{and was one of}} the reasons he was first interested in animation and cartooning. In One Hundred and One Dalmatians, the puppies watch cartoons on television several times; the idea of a cartoon within a cartoon thrilled Groening, and said that this idea inspired him to create The Itchy & Scratchy Show, a fictional television show within the Simpsons universe.|$|R
500|$|The {{following}} year Affleck played a romantic lead in Terrence Malick's experimental drama To the Wonder. Malick, {{a close friend}} of Affleck's godfather, had first met with the actor in the 1990s to offer advice about the plot of Good Will Hunting. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian enjoyed [...] "a performance of dignity and sensitivity," [...] while The New Yorker 's Richard Brody described Affleck as [...] "a solid and muscular performer" [...] who [...] "conveys a sense of thoughtful and willful individuality". Affleck's performance as a poker boss was considered a highlight of the poorly-reviewed thriller Runner Runner (2013). Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times remarked that it was [...] "one killer of a character, and Affleck plays him like a Bach concerto—every note perfectly played." [...] Also in 2013, Affleck hosted the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live for the fifth time since 2000, becoming a member of the Five Timers Club. He then pushed back production on his own directorial project to star as a husband accused of murder in David Fincher's psychological thriller Gone Girl (2014). Fincher cast him partly because he understood what <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be misrepresented by tabloid media: [...] "What many people don’t know is that he's crazy smart, but since he doesn’t want that to get awkward, he downplays it. I think he learned how to skate on charm." [...] David Edelstein of New York Magazine noted that Fincher's controlled style of directing had a [...] "remarkable" [...] effect on Affleck's acting: [...] "I never thought I’d write these words, but he carries the movie. He's terrific." [...] Justin Chang of Variety found Affleck [...] "perfectly cast": [...] "It's a tricky turn, requiring a measure of careful underplaying and emotional aloofness, and he nails it completely." [...] In 2015, Affleck and Damon's Project Greenlight was resurrected by HBO for one season.|$|E

2500|$|Beatty cast Keaton {{after seeing}} her in Annie Hall, {{as he wanted}} to bring her natural {{nervousness}} and insecure attitude to the role. The production of Reds was delayed several times following its conception in 1977, and Keaton almost left the project when she believed {{it would never be}} produced. Filming finally began two years later. In a 2006 Vanity Fair story, Keaton described her role as [...] "the everyman of that piece, as someone who wanted to be extraordinary but was probably more ordinary ... I knew what <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be extremely insecure." [...] Assistant director Simon Relph later stated that Louise Bryant was one of Keaton's most difficult roles, and that [...] " [...] almost got broken." ...|$|E

Richard Marcus, of Music Review, stated [...] "I think I'm being quite honest when I say I've not heard anything like this disc before. ... <b>It</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> listening <b>to</b> the soundtrack from some wonderfully anarchic musical. Something set in a basement night club in Paris during the decadent desperate period just before a war, any war. ... Theatre is Evil is far more dangerous than the music you normally hear, but it lets you know you're alive." [...] Kate Mossman, of The Guardian, wrote [...] "Theatre Is Evil feels like {{sitting on the bed}} of your tattooed, far cooler cousin 30 years ago, while she tells you 'all you need to know' about music." [...] Adam Rathe, of Spin, wrote [...] "If Theatre Is Evil does anything, it should make clear that Amanda Palmer's not just a fundraiser par excellence but someone who's energized enough people with her work to be able to create exactly the kind of record that makes people love music in the first place." ...|$|R
50|$|Herek {{claimed that}} {{functionalism}} was attractive as {{an approach to}} attitude theory because <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> “common sense” <b>to</b> most people and possessed the potential to integrate other attitude theories such as Ajzen & Fishbein’s (1980) theory of reasoned action, or Sears et al.’s (1980) symbolic politics (Herek, 1987), but because Smith (1956) and Katz (1960) failed to create accurate and consistent methodologies in their seminal studies, functionalism {{was never able to}} get off the ground and develop a comprehensive theory able to predict conditions under which specific attitude functions would dominate (Herek, 1987). To create an empirical functional theory, Herek first developed two different methodologies to quantify and group different functions of attitudes.|$|R
2500|$|The Memphis Tour {{was held}} during February and March 2008.

After the first concert {{of the tour}} Sebastian spoke to Stuart Bocking from radio station 2UE about what <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be on stage with the MGs, [...] "There were so many moments when I just {{had to take a}} step back and think 'This is unbelievable'. Like the history that is behind me, and I'm singing these songs. You know they start playing Dock Of The Bay, and the guys that played it are on the stage. You know the guy who wrote the song with Otis Redding is playing guitar. The same with Midnight Hour and Knock on Wood. All these songs that I keep starting. These guys played on the original and wrote the songs, and were the sound that created them." [...] During the interview Sebastian said he had just received a message from Dunn saying, [...] "Thank you for inviting me on this tour. I'm having the time of my life and it's an honour to play with you." ...|$|E

But when the song ended with video footage of the gladiators knocking over a saintly-looking Madonna statue, the tone changed. Madonna has built a career by playing with what we hold sacred, whether it's crucifixes or underground dance crazes. Now the only sacred thing she's tearing down is Madonna herself." ...|$|R
5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. <b>It</b> would have <b>felt</b> silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> we needed <b>to</b> change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|R
