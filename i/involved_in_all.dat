5|$|Despite these grand designs Domitian was {{determined}} to govern the Empire conscientiously and scrupulously. He became personally <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> branches of the administration: edicts were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced. According to Suetonius, the imperial bureaucracy never ran more efficiently than under Domitian, whose exacting standards and suspicious nature maintained historically low corruption among provincial governors and elected officials.|$|E
5|$|He became {{personally}} <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> {{branches of}} the government and successfully prosecuted corruption among public officials. The dark side of his censorial power involved a restriction in freedom of speech, and an increasingly oppressive attitude toward the Roman Senate. He punished libel with exile or death and, due to his suspicious nature, increasingly accepted information from informers to bring false charges of treason if necessary.|$|E
5|$|Indiana, a {{free state}} and the boyhood home of Abraham Lincoln, {{remained}} {{a member of the}} Union during the American Civil War. Indiana regiments were <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> the major engagements of the war and almost all the engagements in the western theater. Hoosiers were present in the first and last battles of the war. During the war, Indiana provided 126 infantry regiments, 26 batteries of artillery, and 13 regiments of cavalry to the cause of the Union.|$|E

5|$|Osorkon ruled {{during one}} of the most chaotic and {{politically}} fragmented periods of ancient Egypt, in which the Nile Delta was dotted with small Libyan kingdoms and principalities and Meshwesh dominions; as the last heir of the Tanite rulers, he inherited the easternmost parts of these kingdoms, the most <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> the political and military upheavals that soon would afflict the Near East. During his reign, he had to face the power, and ultimately submit himself—to the Kushite King Piye during Piye's conquest of Egypt. Osorkon IV also {{had to deal with the}} threatening Neo-Assyrian Empire outside his eastern borders.|$|E
5|$|Bache {{had long}} {{cherished}} the wish of bringing Liszt to London, which Liszt had last visited in 1841 while still a touring virtuoso, and Liszt knew that whatever standing his music had {{in that city}} had {{in large part to}} do with Bache's efforts. At least in part to repay the debt he felt he owed Bache, Liszt accepted Bache's invitation to attend celebrations in April 1886 to commemorate Liszt's 75th birthday. These celebrations included the foundation of a Liszt piano scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music, a performance of his oratorio The Legend of Saint Elizabeth led by Alexander Mackenzie in St. James's Hall, an audience with Queen Victoria and a public reception in Liszt's honour at the Grosvenor Gallery. Bache was <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> four of these events, which were highly successful; by popular demand, Saint Elizabeth had to be repeated at the Crystal Palace.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{managed the}} first tour of Trial by Jury, which {{stopped at the}} Theatre Royal in Dublin, Ireland, in September 1875. While there, he met a young Scottish actress, Susan Couper Black, who used the stage name Helen Lenoir. She became fascinated by his vision for {{establishing}} a company to promote English comic opera and gave up her next engagement to join his theatrical organisation as his secretary. Well-educated, with an organisational ability, business acumen, focus on detail and diplomatic skills that surpassed even Carte's, Lenoir gradually became intensely <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> of his business affairs. Carte and Lenoir married in 1888, {{three years after the}} death of his first wife.|$|E

5|$|Domitian's {{approach}} to government was less subtle {{than his father}} and brother. Once Emperor, he quickly dispensed with the Republican facade and transformed his government more or less formally into the divine monarchy he believed it to be. By moving the centre of power to the imperial court, Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. He became personally <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> branches of the administration: edicts were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced. Nevertheless, Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had virtually excluded non-Flavians from public office, Domitian rarely favoured his own family members {{in the distribution of}} strategic posts, admitting a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, and assigning men of the equestrian order to run the imperial bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|One of {{his best}} seasons was the 2008–09 season, in which he scored {{seventeen}} league goals and made nine assists. As well as finishing as the club's top scorer, he was named Player of the Season {{for the second year}} running, as Watford finished 13th. Smith made his 300th appearance for Watford in the penultimate game of the season, a 3–2 win away to Coventry City. He started the 2009–10 season in similar form, and was <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> of Watford's first seven league goals, scoring two and assisting the other five. This was despite ongoing transfer speculation linking Smith with Reading—managed by former Watford manager Brendan Rodgers—as well as other Premier League and Championship clubs, and Watford manager Malky Mackay confirming that the club was considering an offer for him.|$|E
5|$|Heroes of Mana was {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by Takeo Oin, and written by Masato Kato. Ishii had previously produced or directed all of the previous Mana games, while Kato also wrote the stories for Children of Mana (2006) and Dawn of Mana (2006). The game was developed by Brownie Brown, who previously helped develop Sword of Mana (2003). Ishii created the overall design, and Brownie Brown worked directly with him to implement it. As the series creator, Ishii {{felt it was important}} to be directly <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> stages of development. Heroes of Mana was created as an RTS game to complement the other titles in the World of Mana project, which all offer a spin on the original Seiken Densetsu formula. Ishii stated that it was also to help expose Japanese gamers to real-time strategy games, a genre that is relatively obscure in Japan, while simultaneously satisfying players abroad with an RTS for an unconventional console, as most real-time strategy games are released for personal computers. To match this mission, the game was designed for more casual players than the typical fan of the traditionally role-playing game series. The Nintendo DS was chosen as the platform partially due to the system's multiplayer potential as well as giving the sensation of touching the game. The team found developing an RTS for the Nintendo DS to be difficult, and had to start development over at one point. Although prior to the World of Mana project Ishii has said that the games in the series are only thematically connected, Heroes is explicitly set as a prequel to Seiken Densetsu 3 (1995), depicting battles between the nations present in that game. It is set one generation prior to Seiken Densetsu 3, with some characters noted as the parents of characters in the other game.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1999, a live {{production}} of Blue's Clues toured the U.S. to positive reviews. Johnson compared the show's audience participation {{with that of}} The Rocky Horror Picture Show. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances. The creators of the TV show were <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> aspects of the live show, aiming to translate the bond between the TV show's audience and its cast to the stage and to provide young audiences with their first theatrical experience. The creators chose Jonathan Hochwald as the live show's producer, Gip Hoppe as its director, and Dave Gallo as its set designer. Neither Hoppe nor Gallo had any previous experience in children's theater. Nick Balaban and Michael Rubin, who wrote the music for the TV show, composed the live show's soundtrack. The producers were concerned with children's response to the host, who was played by Tom Mizer (a different actor than {{the host of the}} TV show), but his young audience enthusiastically accepted and embraced him. Actors were encouraged to improvise and respond to the audience, which resulted in changes throughout the show's run. The show's script included humor that both children and their parents could enjoy.|$|E
5|$|The Powerpuff Girls Movie was {{released}} in the United States on July 3, 2002, by Warner Bros. and Cartoon Network. The movie, a prequel to the series, {{tells the story of}} how the Powerpuff Girls were created, and how Mojo Jojo became a supervillain. After Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup were created by Professor Utonium to help the city against crime, they end up only causing chaos in Townsville. Down about how everyone refers to them as freaks, they turn to Mojo Jojo, a monkey who says he is there to help make people like them again. Unknown to the girls, Mojo Jojo was Professor Utonium's lab chimp helper who was mutated as a cause from the Powerpuff Girls being made and has become super smart as a result and jealous of them. Mojo Jojo ends up tricking the girls into helping him make a machine to mutate other chimps. Seeing what they have done the kids run away in shame but come back after seeing Professor Utonium in trouble, and Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup end up beating Mojo Jojo and his army of mutated smart chimps and saving the day, thus becoming Townsville's new defenders. The movie received a rating of 63% at Rotten Tomatoes and received some criticism for the violence <b>involved.</b> <b>In</b> <b>all,</b> the movie grossed $16 million worldwide with an $11 million budget.|$|E
