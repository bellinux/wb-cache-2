40|$|Abstract. Poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) {{is a kind}} of {{biodegradable}} materials. In {{this paper}} PBS foaming materials is prepared by physical foaming method of one-step compression molding. The influences of blowing agent and nucleating agent, the foaming temperature and foaming time on the cellular morphology of PBS foaming materials have been studied. The results showed that when the foaming temperature was 160 ˚C, the blowing agent content was 5 parts, the foaming pressure was higher than 10 MPa, and the foaming time was 20 minutes with nucleating agent addition, the cellular morphology and mechanical properties of the foaming materials were better. The results showed that the foaming technology influenced greatly on the properties of foam of PBS materials. The expansion ratio had a small drop when the temperature increased. The addition of nucleator talc and <b>foaming</b> <b>aids</b> urea increased first then decreased the expansion ratio of the PBS foaming materials...|$|R

Foam balloons are used frequently for advertising purposes, since they can be manufactured easily {{in the form of}} company symbols.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{endoscope}} with aided lens {{was designed}} for observation of fire-fighting foam. Firstly, water-proof and corrosion-resistant endoscope was completed according to the <b>foam’s</b> characteristics. Then, <b>aided</b> lens for clear observation was designed corresponding to the endoscope’s lens system. Secondly, the fire-fighting foam was produced using low expansion foam extinguishing system and observed through endoscope with aided lens. Finally, the data were analyzed considering the foam’s drainage process.

40|$|Objective: Demonstrate plate tectonic principles, plate {{boundary}} interactions and the geometry and relative motions of faulting of geologic layers using 3 -D foam models. The <b>foam</b> models <b>aid</b> in visualization {{and understanding of}} plate motions and faulting because the models are three-dimensional, concrete rather than abstract descriptions or diagrams, can be manipulated by the instructor and the students, and the models can show the motions of the plates and faults through time {{in addition to the}} three-dimensional configuration of the plates or layers. The fault and {{plate boundary}} models shown here illustrate relatively simple motions and geologic structures. Although these models are accurate representations of real Earth faulting and plate tectonic structures and motions, the spherical shape of the Earth and the complexity of geological features caused by varying rock types and rock properties and geological development over many millions or hundreds of millions of years, result in significant complexity and variability of actual fault systems and plate tectonic boundaries...|$|R
40|$|Open cell Al foams {{have been}} made by infiltrating molten Al into preforms made from porous salt spheres. Infiltration has been {{effected}} using simple pressure-assisted vacuum investment casting where the maximum infiltration pressure difference was less than 36 psi. The preform and resulting foam density decreased with increasing compaction pressure and the foam density increased with increasing infiltration pressure. For low pressure infiltration, and high density preforms, salt dissolution was rapid due to the porous nature of the salt spheres. Infiltration of molten Al occurred into the beads and, for high density preforms and higher infiltration pressures, the volume of metal in the beads exceeded that in the cell walls, drastically decreasing the NaCl dissolution rate. A simple approach is shown whereby the data from mercury porosimetry can be used to predict the resulting <b>foam</b> density, thereby <b>aiding</b> the design of preform and beads structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{maintaining}} a lower specific {{engine oil temperature}} is essential in enhancing the longevity of the oil and of the engine and its components. By decreasing the engine oil temperature the oil is able to perform its job more efficiently. It is proposed to use the carbon foam, with its exceptional thermal management capabilities, to aid in reducing and stabilizing the engine oil temperature during steady state operation. Also, {{it is possible to}} use the carbon foam to heat the engine oil during startup to reduce emissions and possibly engine wear. The mesophase pitch derived carbon foam, developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is a material that offers excellent thermal management capability. The foam has an open cell structure (0. 98 fraction open porosity) with graphitic ligaments aligned parallel to the cell walls. The alignment of the graphitic ligaments in a three dimensional array gives the foam homogeneous thermal properties, unlike graphite fibers. The bulk thermal conductivity of the foam has been measured to be 175 W/m{center_dot}K, placing it on the level of 6061 aluminum, which has a bulk thermal conductivity of 180 W/m{center_dot}K. Copper has a bulk thermal conductivity over two times higher, at 400 W/m{center_dot}K. The proposed research will entail using the carbon foam, with its excellent thermal management capabilities, as a cooling and heating medium for engine oil, or in other words an oil temperature regulator. The <b>foam</b> will <b>aid</b> in maintaining a specific oil temperature during steady state operation and in heating of the engine oil at startup. Being able to maintain a consistent oil temperature will ensure better operation of engine oil, by extending the life of the oil and engine. All Parties will conduct research efforts {{in order to determine the}} best utilization of the carbon foam in managing engine oil temperatures...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} {{study has been}} conducted to investigate characteristics of upward forward smoldering combustion of an unretarded polyurethane foam in a forced oxidizer flow. Experiments are done in a small-scale, vertically oriented smoldering cylindrical apparatus. The oxidizer is forced through the igniter which is contact with the bottom surface of foam in a certain volume flow rate. A constant power to igniter is applied until the temperature of foam at 30 mm reached 300 °C which make smoldering can propagate itself interior the <b>foam</b> without the <b>aid</b> of igniter. The temperature histories of foam are measured by 14 type-K thermocouples. The gas and condensate released during smoldering are also analyzed by GC and GC/MS respectively. It is shown that the smoldering propagation rate and heat rate of fuel both increase when the smolder front propagates {{from the bottom of}} fuel to upper. During the smolder process, concentration of oxygen is below to 0. 5 %, concentrations of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide reach up to 5 % and 7. 6 %, respectively. The ruselts also show that more than 73 compounds are identified which including alcohol, ethers and olycyclic aromatic compounds...|$|R
40|$|Foam {{flooding}} as {{a mechanism}} to enhance oil recovery has been intensively studied and {{is the subject of}} multiple research groups. However, limited stability of surfactant-generated foam in presence of oil and low chemical stability of surfactants in the high temperature and high salinity of an oil reservoir are among the reasons for foam EOR not being widely applied in the field. Unlike surfactants, nanoparticles, which are shown to be effective in stabilizing bulk foam, are chemically stable {{in a wide range of}} physicochemical conditions. Recent studies suggest that synthesized nanoparticles with altered surface properties can <b>aid</b> <b>foam</b> generation and increase foam stability in porous media. In this paper, the focus lies on a silica-based nanoparticle that is available in large quantities and can be processed economically without separate surface treatment, which gives it the potential to become a practical solution in the field. The research is primarily conducted by performing core-flooding experiments under varying conditions to quantitatively assess and compare the potential of the nanoparticle-enhanced foam. Two types of reservoir rocks have been investigated: sandstone and carbonate rocks. It is observed that by adding even low concentrations of nanoparticles to a near-CMC surfactant solution, the foam viscosity considerably increases.

2500|$|The {{conversion}} of dissolved carbon dioxide to gaseous carbon dioxide forms rapidly expanding gas bubbles in the soda, which pushes the beverage contents {{out of the}} container. Gasses, in general, are more soluble in liquids at elevated pressures. Carbonated sodas contain elevated levels of carbon dioxide under pressure. The solution becomes supersaturated with carbon dioxide when the bottle is opened, and the pressure is released. Under these conditions, carbon dioxide begins to precipitate from solution, forming gas bubbles. Normally, this process is relatively slow, because the activation energy for this process is high. The activation energy for a process like bubble nucleation depends on where the bubble forms. It is highest for bubbles that form in the liquid itself (homogeneous nucleation), and lower if the bubble forms on some other surface (heterogeneous nucleation). When the pressure is released from a soda bottle, the bubbles tend to form {{on the sides of}} the bottle. But because they are smooth and clean, the activation energy is still relatively high, and the process is slow. The addition of other nucleation sites provides an alternative pathway for the reaction to occur with lower activation energy, much like a catalyst. For instance dropping grains of salt or sand into the solution lowers the activation energy, and increases the rate of carbon dioxide precipitation. The physical characteristics of Mentos (surface roughness, easy dissolution into the liquid, etc.) have the effect of drastically reducing the activation energy for carbon dioxide bubble formation, so that the nucleation rate becomes exceedingly high. The activation energy for the release of carbon dioxide from Diet Coke by addition of Mentos has been found to be 25 kJ mol−1. This formation of gaseous carbon dioxide within the water, which due to hydrogen bonding and its high surface tension wants to maintain a connected matrix of molecules, causes the water to foam, ultimately generating the [...] "jet"—or [...] "geyser"—or eruption-like nature of the effusion. The <b>foaming</b> is <b>aided</b> by the presence of chemicals like potassium benzoate and aspartame in Diet Coke, and gelatin and gum arabic in the Mentos candy, all which influence the nature of water's surface tension and degree to which it can foam.|$|R
40|$|This thesis reports {{research}} {{work in the}} development of biodegradable foams in block forms based on wheat flour for cushion packaging application. A novel concept of Regular Packing and Stacking (RPS) was developed for production of macro-composites block foams that combines extrusion foaming of starch <b>foams</b> with selfadhesion <b>aided</b> by application of water to produce block foams with a network of reinforcing interfaces. The structure and material properties of the foams can be manipulated through control of foam cell structure and the interface network. Parameters controlling the evolution of cell structures including processing conditions and additives were systematically studied using a twin-screw extruder. Under constant screw speed and controlled feed rate, high barrel temperature profiles with appropriate water contents were found to result in finer cell structure foams. Short length reverse screw with tight pitch was found more effective to produce fine cell foams. Addition of 22 micron talc powder at 1 wt% was found effective as a nucleating agent. Addition of flax fibre resulted in fine cell and high strength foams. The key variables in design and operation of a RPS machine were investigated. A pultrusion technique has been employed to reform the extruded foam strands to modify their shape and density and facilitate self-adhesion. Uniform wetting was achieved by using water absorbent fabrics to apply water in a controlled manner. Foam strands were then bonded to form macro-composite block foams. A RPS demonstration machine was successfully developed. The key factors affecting the macro structure and performances of the RPS block foams were investigated in great detail. Extruded foam strands were anisotropic and this feature was utilised in the design of RPS block foams to manipulate their properties in different strands' orientations. Thicker interfaces formed a network within the RPS block foams, which was found to make a significant contribution to the strengthening of the RPS foams (by a factor of 3). High humidity conditioning of the RPS foams was found an efficient way to control density and refine cell structure of the foams which could increase foam density by a factor of 3. 5 and compressive strength by a factor of 10. This work has made significant contributions {{to the development of a}} novel technology for processing of block foams based on starch foam and understanding of extrusion foaming process, structure and properties of the starch materials. The research results paved the way for the industrial development of biodegradable block foams for cushion packaging application, which are based on renewable resources and are bio-compostable and thus facilitate reduction of landfill at the end of their intended service life.

40|$|Besides the low weight, good thermal {{conductivity}} and high porosity open-cell foam structures exhibit very good mechanical damping properties. Especially the damping properties promise interesting applications, e. g. in the automotive and transportation fields. However, {{up to now}} metal foam’s material models are inaccurate. In addition, there is a missing understanding of the mechanical properties’ scatter hindering the large scale application of open-cell foams in automotive serial production. Current literature offers only limited information {{about the influence of}} the foam struts’ imperfection, cross-sectional form, and microstructure. In order to close this current research gap, the process and design parameter, and the chemical composition were systematically varied during the production of open-cell precision-cast aluminium foams. The foams were analysed in regard to their micro- und macroscopic deformation behaviour during compression test; and their microstructure and strength, as well. If foam cells are arranged stochastical there is a little influence of missing struts on the compression strength. Due to the initiation of a high number of micro cracks notched struts lead to a smooth stress plateau and a slight decrease of the compression strength. The strength of open-cell, bending-dominated foams is significantly increased by a triangular cross-sectional form of the struts due to its higher bending stiffness. The use of a ductile basic material for highly porous foams leads to a continuously increase of their stress plateau during compression due to strain hardening. In this case, the compression strength is mainly determined by the foam’s relative density and can be calculated with the Gibson-Ashby-model. Due to the supporting effect of collapsed struts the compression strength of less porous, ductile foams differ from the prediction of the Gibson-Ashby-model. With decreased porosity the energy absorption efficiency is decreased. At a strut diameter of < 260 µm in precision-cast metal foams there is one grain per strut; secondary phases are located between the dendrite arms and around the dendrite leading to an increased number of phases next the struts’ surface. By an increase of the amount of eutectic phases the overall phases’ distribution is more homogeneous leading to a less oscillating stress plateau. Polygonal, spiky phases lead to a more distinctive peak stress and a discontinuous stress plateau progression. If secondary phases are rounded, e. g. by alloying, there is a continuous transition between the linear-elastic section to a smoother stress plateau. Small, plate-shaped secondary phases increase the density-normalised compression strength accompanied by a slight increase of the command variable’s scatter. The present work contributes {{to the understanding of the}} systematic influence of the (micro-) structure on the deformation and compression strength of open-cell, precision-cast <b>foams.</b> With the <b>aid</b> of the developed models the compression strength of these foams can be calculated precisely...|$|R
