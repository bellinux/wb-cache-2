5|$|Bellerophon {{was briefly}} {{refitted}} in January 1810, after {{which she was}} anchored at the Nore. She then resumed her blockade duties in the North Sea, serving under a succession of commanders. Warren was succeeded by Captain John <b>Halsted</b> on 23 August, and he by Captain Augustus Brine on 5 November. Brine's command lasted until February 1813, during which time Bellerophon remained with the North Sea blockading squadron. Captain Edward Hawker arrived to take over command on 11 February 1813, and preparations were made for Bellerophon to become the flagship of Vice-Admiral Sir Richard Goodwin Keats, the newly appointed Governor of Newfoundland. Bellerophon transported Keats to St. John's, and then sailed south to Bermuda as a convoy escort. Returning to St John's in the summer, she captured several American ships, including the 16-gun privateer Genie. She {{spent the rest of}} the year patrolling off Cape Race, before returning to Britain with a convoy in November. 1814 was spent on similar duties: Bellerophon escorted a convoy to St John's between April and June, and then patrolled off Cape Race until December. She then moved to the Nore, and on 9 April 1815 Hawker was superseded by Captain Frederick Lewis Maitland.|$|E

40|$|Recently, we {{isolated}} dehydroipomeamarone, a new sesquiterpenoid from {{sweet potato}} (Ipomoea batatas Lam.) root tissue infected with Ceratocystis fimbriata (Ell. et <b>Halst.).</b> The {{purpose of this}} investigation was to determine whether dehydroipomeamarone was a precursor in the biosynthetic pathway of ipomeamarone. The incorporation of acetate- 2 - 14 C into ipomeamarone was markedly inhibited by the presence of dehydroipomeamarone. Radioactive dehydroipomeamarone was efficiently converted into ipomeamarone, and the compound was biosynthesized earlier than ipomeamarone according to a time course analysis of the production of the terpenoid. These results support the notion that dehydroipomeamarone is an immediate precursor of ipomeamarone. On the other hand, the production of ipomeamarone was slightly lessened in the presence of dehydroipomeamarone. Thus, the marked reduction of acetate- 2 - 14 C incorporation into ipomeamarone by dehydroipomeamarone may result from both isotopic dilution and an inhibitory effect by exogenous dehydroipomeamarone...|$|R
