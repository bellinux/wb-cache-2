Subsequently, Granada TV personality Johnathan Routh (of Candid Camera fame) recorded a game with the original players {{at the same place}} for his show 'Nice Time'. There is a reference to the sport which predates this- originating in the fertile imagination of Michael Bentine, who had a show called It's a Square World, on the BBC. A skit in one episode had explorers stumble across a group of natives playing the sport in the darkest reaches of the English countryside. The episode aired some time between 1960 and 1964, when the show was originally broadcast.|$|R
