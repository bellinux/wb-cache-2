25|$|American {{political}} scientist Peter Roman’s {{work on the}} subject led him to believe that Cuba’s “grassroots democracy” goes beyond the power to vote freely for one of several candidates representing both pro or anti-socialist positions. He argues that at the “people level” democracy exists in Cuba today and that this democracy has been strengthened during the 1990s by conscious decisions made at the top. Roman also writes that the historical origins of contemporary Cuban democracy are {{the ideas of the}} centrality of unity and consensus, and the rejection of a distinction between political and civil society. Thus, unanimous votes in representative bodies do not represent, as critics charge, imposition by the PCC, but rather legitimate consensus worked out in lengthy discussion at several levels. British political professor Steve Ludlum wrote in his paper “Participation is key to Cuba’s democracy” that “Two models of democracy competed for support in nineteenth century Europe. The one we know is based on <b>indirect</b> <b>representation</b> by professional politicians controlled by party factions. The other model, associated with Rousseau’s concept of the ‘general will’ and made famous by the Paris Commune of 1870”. Ludlum likens Cuba’s local participation to the latter model.|$|E

The counties, the towns, and the seaports, accurately enough represented the only interests then existing; that is say,--the landed, the shop-keeping or manufacturing, and the mercantile. But for a century past, at least, this division has become notoriously imperfect, some of the most vital interests of the empire being now totally unconnected with any English localities. Yet now, when the evil and the want are known, we are to abandon the accommodations which the necessity of the case had worked out for itself, and begin again with a rigidly territorial plan of representation! The miserable tendency of all is to destroy our nationality, which consists, in a principal degree, in our representative government, and to convert it into a degrading delegation of the populace. There is no unity for a people but in a representation of national interests; a delegation from the passions or wishes of the individuals themselves is a rope of sand. Undoubtedly it is a great evil, that there should be such an evident discrepancy between the law and the practice of the constitution in the matter of the representation. Such a direct, yet clandestine, contravention of solemn resolutions and established laws is immoral, and greatly injurious to the cause of legal loyalty and general subordination {{in the minds of the}} people. But then a statesman should consider that these very contraventions of law in practice point out to him the places in the body politic which need a remodelling of the law. You acknowledge a certain necessity for <b>indirect</b> <b>representation</b> in the present day, and that such representation has been instinctively obtained by means contrary to law; why then do you not approximate the useless law to the useful practice, instead of abandoning both law and practice for a completely new system of your own? ...|$|E

The movement that resulted from this demand led to the Heidelberg meeting of 5 March 1848, which in turn led to the Vorparlament of 31 March - 5 April in the Frankfurt Paulskirche. Bassermann participated in both events, where, together with other moderate liberals, he could work towards ensuring that the majority of those present regarded the creation of a constitution in consultation with the German Confederation and in the context of a national constitutional assembly as the highest priority, and not the formation of a revolutionary government as demanded by Hecker und Struve.

40|$|Parallel machine scheduling, {{also known}} as {{parallel}} task scheduling, involves the assignment of multiple tasks onto the system architecture’s processing components (a bank of machines in parallel).

The completion time of the last job to leave the system, known as the makespan (Cmax), {{is one of the most}} important objective functions to be minimized, because it usually implies high utilization of resources, but other important objectives must be also considered. These problems are known in the literature [9, 11] as unrestricted parallel machine scheduling problems.

This project investigates how such consolidation of memories occurs during sleep. In 4 studies participants will keep a daily diary and will also produce reports of their dreams, either at home or in the sleep laboratory. How dream content is related to events from waking life will be studied. Incorporations of waking life events into dreams can be literal replications of events, <b>indirect</b> <b>representations,</b> or even metaphors. The timescale of incorporations will be examined, aiming to replicate the dream-lag effect, in which events from 5 - 7 days before the dream are incorporated as frequently as events from 1 - 2 days before the dream, with a dip in incorporations on days 3 - 4. This effect may indicate an approximately week-long memory processing function for sleep. Because Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (REM) is thought to be especially important for the consolidation of emotional memories, the project differentiates REM dreams from non-REM dreams, and emotional from neutral memories. The project also tests whether specific experimenter induced experiences are incorporated into dreams in a delayed manner, and uses a direct behavioural test of how memory consolidation occurs across several periods of sleep...|$|R
