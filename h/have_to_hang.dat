25|$|Ed Harris did not {{actually}} breathe the fluid. He held his breath inside a helmet full of liquid while being towed 30 feet (10 m) {{below the surface of}} the large tank. He recalled that the worst moments were being towed with fluid rushing up his nose and his eyes swelling up. Actors played their scenes at 33 feet (11 m), too shallow a depth for them to need decompression, and rarely stayed down for more than an hour at a time. Cameron and the 26-person underwater diving crew sank to 50 feet (17 m) and stayed down for five hours at a time. To avoid decompression sickness, they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> from hoses halfway up the tank for as long as two hours, breathing pure oxygen.|$|E

6000|$|... "You'd {{get home}} {{in the middle of}} the afternoon, I suppose, and you'd drive up to the house, and the servant would open the door, and you'd go in.

60|$|It says {{much for}} Archie's pre-occupation {{that his first}} thought, as, after a few {{scattered}} drops, as though the clouds were submitting samples for approval, the whole sky suddenly began to stream like a shower-bath, {{was that this was}} simply an additional infliction which he was called upon to bear, On top of all his other troubles he would get soaked to the skin or <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> about in some doorway. He cursed richly, and sped for shelter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I have, these ten years. Very often, {{night after}} night, my clothes will be {{wringing}} wet.

[...] Nelson agreed that this was done on the Moredon trips too.|$|R

[...] His eyes looked along the ranks, making it plain that he addressed them all. [...] "I desire that Colonel Bishop should have his life. One reason is that I require him as a hostage.

Wouldn't you like to do that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Augustus {{looked as}} though he were detected, and stammered out some {{question}} about his mother and the carriage; but Miss Furnival did not for a moment lose her easy presence of mind.

6000|$|... "There {{is always}} {{something}} serious {{the matter with}} a person of my age," [...] said Miss Panney, [...] "and as for Dr. Tolbridge's visits to me doing him any harm, it is all stuff and nonsense.

6000|$|As they parted at Euston Square, Phineas {{asked his}} friend some little nervous {{question}} as to the best mode of making a first entrance into the House.

50|$|With {{casualties}} mounting, Moorhead made up {{his mind}} to fall back to Betong, with permission from divisional headquarters.

50|$|Being filmed on {{the water}} (in the Polish Lake District Masuria), and largely within the {{confines}} of a sailboat and liferaft, the film was technically difficult.

6000|$|He meditated upon Bert for a time. [...] "So far as I can judge, Smallways," [...] he said, [...] "the Prince will {{probably}} want to throw you overboard--next time he thinks of you. He certainly will if he sees you.... After all, you know, you came als Ballast.... And we shall have to lighten ship extensively pretty soon. Unless I'm mistaken, the Prince will wake up presently and start doing things with tremendous vigour.... I've taken a fancy to you. It's the English strain in me. You're a rum little chap. I shan't like seeing you whizz down the air.... You'd better make yourself useful, Smallways. I think I shall requisition you for my squad. You'll have to work, you know, and be infernally intelligent and all that. And you'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> about upside down a bit. Still, it's the best chance you have. We shan't carry passengers much farther this trip, I fancy. Ballast goes over-board--if we don't want to ground precious soon and be taken prisoners of war. The Prince won't do that anyhow. He'll be game to the last." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} {{once when}} we had been having a long spell of wet weather, and the low-lying plain about Los Alamos was getting flooded, she came to visit my mother and told her reassuringly that the rain would not last much longer. St. Anthony was the saint she was devoted to, and she had taken his image from its place in her bedroom and tied a string round its legs and let it down the well and left it there with its head in the water. He was her own saint, she said, and after all her devotion to him, and all the candles and flowers, this was how he treated her! It was all very well, she told her saint, to amuse himself by causing the rain to fall for days and weeks just {{to find out whether}} men would be drowned or turn themselves into frogs to save themselves: now she, Dona Pascuala, was going to find out how he liked it. There, with his head in the water, he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> in the well until the weather changed.|$|E
60|$|Of {{course you}} know a cannon down there would be quite light. Even in shallow water, where men go down with a diving-dress, they grow so light that they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> weights about their necks, and have their boots loaded with twenty pounds of lead--as I know to my sorrow. And with all this, and the helmet, which is heavy enough of itself to any one {{up here in the}} thin air, they are carried about like gossamers, and have to take every kind of care not to be upset and stood upon their heads. I went down once in the dress, and speak from experience. But if we could get down for a moment near where the fishes are, we should be in a tight place. Suppose the water not to crush us (which it would), we should pitch about in every kind of direction; every step we took would carry us as far as if we had seven-league boots; and we should keep flying head over heels, and top over bottom, like the liveliest clowns in the world.|$|E
