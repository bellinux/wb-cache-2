40|$|Setting up an {{enterprise}} requires enthusiasm, creativity and perseverance, while afterwards the gradual expansion {{of a company}} calls instead for management skills like efficiency, efficacy and reliability. Since both personality and management skills are decisive factors in determining success, personal skills connected to an entrepreneurial spirit should be taught early on and cultivated up to university level, {{where it will be}} possible concentrating on the acquisition of management skills. Recently, the European Commission has revealed that most member states are involved in several ways in promoting the teaching of entrepreneurship within their own educational systems. Our research starts from the Oslo conference and agenda on "Entrepreneurship Education in Europe: Fostering <b>Entrepreneurial</b> <b>Mindsets</b> through Education and Learning", highlighting the main experiences in Europe and their outcomes regarding the promotion of entrepreneurship in education. The main research objective is to define an educational model to support students in the development both of personal qualities and attitudes and of formal knowledge and skills. The model will adopt entrepreneurial environments based on social educational games. Entrepreneurial networking is more than just collaboration since it stimulates the ability to find and create new relationships, the ability and the know how to identify the key competencies that can be useful in developing <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>mindsets...</b>|$|R
30|$|Finally, it is {{important}} to emphasize that the current model explicitly excludes changes in attitudes of individuals over time. The key change that emerges from the Spanish case is in the distribution of skills in the working population shifting to the right, almost certainly reflecting improvements in education.

Consulting these approaches, the following seams to be particularly crucial: action-/project-based learning, individual and collaborative (team) experiential learning, interdisciplinary grouping, enhancing entrepreneurial skills and knowledge, key qualifications (creativity, autonomy, responsibility, risk-taking), conceptual and informal learning, critical thinking, reflection, meta-cognition, working with innovative ideas, demythologization, learning through "fun", and student-company-university collaboration/networks...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSince 1992, {{there has}} been {{development}} of a triple helix of university-industry-government in the jewellery industry to produce middle management for original equipment manufacturing (OEM), which is mostly typical in Thai industry. To promote the export market, jewellery manufacturers needed to develop added-value products {{along the lines of}} an original brand manufacturing (OBM) model. Thai government policy has been to promote research and innovation in universities for transfer to industry and subsequent development of innovative products and brand image. Hence, new materials and innovative technologies needed to be delivered to the Thai jewellery industry. However, there were struggles with OEM to develop a brand image among the mindsets of workers. Therefore, the innovation-branding development concept was introduced in small- to medium-sized enterprises. University business incubators were introduced as a scientific classroom-based activity of material science program focusing on gems and jewellery to develop interpersonal skills and <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>mindsets.</b> This paper reports on the development of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>mindsets</b> in this environment and the diffusion of marketing and technological concepts in the industry. A dummy company was established, and it selected innovations from universities for students to role-play brand manufacturers, selling products in international trading fairs. These activities began in 2009 and the careers of the key persons involved have been followed. Data was collected on the success of their careers as entrepreneurs after graduation. The results show that they are eager and persistent to do the business and develop their own brand right after graduation. Some characteristics such as engagement, social responsibilities, participative behaviour and honesty in business were displayed...|$|R

40|$|Original paper can {{be found}} at : [URL] Copyright Industrial Marketing and Purchasing GroupPurpose of the Paper & Literature Addressed : This paper explores the often very {{difficult}} task of changing business mindsets of the dominant business entrepreneur. Often, these changes are being driven by the dramatic increase in ambiguity and uncertainty in the enterprises??? current marketplace, forcing them to seek help from business advisors, or taking up opportunities to work with Higher Education Institutions on Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs). The key focus of this paper is around evaluating the approaches to guiding business entrepreneur???s to change their business model, and evolving their enterprise towards being entrepreneurially and enterprise-driven. Existing literature on <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>mindsets</b> often talk about the challenges to their values, attitudes and behavior (Brown and Proudlove 2008), and how this can both act as an enabler and barrier to change (Herbert 2000). The challenges to change mindsets is often down to two factors; convincing the business entrepreneur that the marketplace dynamics have changed (Laczniak and Lusch 1997), and that adopting a new business model is important for survival and growth of their enterprise (Pina e Cunha, da Cunha et al. 2001). Research Method : A case study approach is used to investigate the issues identified above. Six case studies were chosen to exemplify the key enablers and barriers to delivering value from Knowledge Transfer Partnerships. The study draws on data collected over ten years of working with Small- to Mediumsized Enterprises (SMEs) on knowledge/technology transfer projects, often over several years. Research Findings : The level of success achieved from these knowledge/technology transfer projects can be directly linked to the correct identification of the business <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>mindsets</b> and the enterprises??? current business model and strategic orientation. The findings reveal the challenges when entrepreneur and intrapreneur mindsets towards business model changes diverge, and are unreconcilable...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © Senate Hall Academic Publishing 2008 The {{focus of}} this paper is on <b>Entrepreneurial</b> Global <b>Mindset,</b> an {{important}} cognitive capability and a source of sustainable competitive advantage for an international new venture. Developing a global mindset means acquiring a set of specific competencies. We put forward a definition of <b>entrepreneurial</b> global <b>mindset</b> and a model linking global mindset and its constituents to competencies and effective task performance. Based on the available evidence regarding what constitutes a global mindset in entrepreneurs and which mindset-related competencies are trainable rather than innate, we suggest that some of these competencies can and should be taught as part of the entrepreneurship education curriculum. We propose entrepreneurship education and training strategies geared toward stimulation of international entrepreneurship and increasing the probability of success of international new ventures.

40|$|Part 3 : Section 2 : Sustainable and Responsible InnovationInternational audienceDrawing {{upon the}} policy {{literature}} and empirical work, this paper proposes an ecological {{model in which}} entrepreneurial skills are {{a critical part of}} the human infrastructure needed to fuel national Digital Economy and Innovation strategies. While many countries around the world reference the importance of building a “culture of innovation” and some countries, such as Israel, are seen as having this deeply embedded, there are few definitions and fewer empirical studies assessing this. We suggest that the prevalence of individuals with <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>mindsets</b> and a willingness to take risks will drive economic growth and development but that developing this is easier said than done, as complex factors shape values and aspirations. While University-based incubators have long been seen as important parts of the innovation ecosystem, we provide a case study of a unique incubator, Ryerson University’s Digital Media Zone (Toronto, Canada), and suggest that it not only offers short term outcomes but also offers a model that is critical to fostering a culture of innovation. We conclude that {{more needs to be done}} in Canada to promote this culture of innovation and that it needs to begin long before students reach university...|$|R

40|$|Societies {{around the}} globe respond to the {{contemporary}} technological and economic change by defining entrepreneurship and innovation as core principles for future competitive advantage. Does this rise of the “entrepreneurial society” also imply that entrepreneurial personalities are becoming increasingly widespread and powerful in political leadership? Joseph A. Schumpeter already argued that highly influential entrepreneurs are unique and show a certain personality pattern that {{can be described as}} being not only high in creativity and change orientation but also high in competitiveness and rule-breaking. It is interesting to ask whether such Schumpeterian personalities indeed play an increasingly important role in political leadership, given that daily routines of policy leaders, at least at first glance, usually require rather non-entrepreneurial strategies such as careful, risk-averse diplomacy. To address this question, we first survey the existing literature on personality and political leadership. We further present a novel personality analysis of an influential business leader that recently made a transition to political leadership: Donald J. Trump, the incumbent US president. Employing a language-based, computerized method of analyzing Twitter statements, we compare his online personality to the online personality of other influential entrepreneurs and business managers, who do not engage in political leadership. The results indicate that Trump is indeed distinct in that he shows stronger features of a Schumpeterian personality. However, he is also comparatively high in Neuroticism. We discuss these findings focusing on the potential implications of a concentration of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>mindsets</b> in political leadership...|$|R

Against this backdrop the authors seek to contribute to the graduate skills debate. They will demonstrate that delivering employment-ready graduates ignores the demands of a radically altered world of work in the face of the government's response to the latest economic crisis. While its primary focus is on the supply side (graduates) the authors are cognisant of the market research industry, which itself is facing external pressures to shift from a milieu of data gathering to a future of intelligent insight providers. We then go on to present the development of a new type of university, which has actively sought to reduce its dependency on traditional funding sources. Finally, we present a model of a research facility at one university that has successfully engaged with the local and regional business community to the benefit of its student workforce. In doing so, it has helped to develop over 70 graduate researchers, with <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>mindsets,</b> who have all gone on to secure enterprising futures...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge and {{creativity}} have always {{played a key}} role in the economy and New Zealand is rapidly moving towards a knowledge-based strategy for growth. Increasing prominence has been given to the role of New Zealand’s universities in stimulating economic growth through industry related research, technology commercialisation, high-tech spin-offs, and nurturing <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>mindsets.</b> Universities are notoriously difficult to change; however the society and culture in which they operate are adapting and accommodate change at a faster pace. Universities in New Zealand have made efforts to see social, government and corporate relationships evolve, however, there are still issues to be addressed and difficulties to be overcome with respect to orthodox disciplines and procedures that need to evolve within the university to facilitate the transition. This paper draws on existing literature related to tri-lateral networks and hybrid organisations to inform the development of a new initiative focused on developing a research system that cuts across both organisational and disciplinary boundaries. The new initiative brings together business, government, researchers, students, and the wider community from the South Auckland region. The initiative is intentionally adaptive, fluid and transient in order to accommodate multiple models of co-evolution of knowledge. The paper sheds new light on the evolving role of university and outlines a future direction for the initiative and a range of measures that can be used to evaluate its successes by presented the initial stages of a longitudinal case study of an emerging initiative. It frames a computational agent-based simulation where alternative architectures can be benchmarked in their capacity to promote entrepreneurial activity...|$|R
