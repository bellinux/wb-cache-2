500|$|The enamel lies {{flush with}} the gold surfaces; it was a {{preparation}} of finely ground glass paste applied with great care to the prepared recessed areas, and then fired. Different colours of enamel meet {{each other with a}} neat boundary, which was achieved by firing one colour with a retaining border of <b>gum</b> <b>tragacanth</b> before adding the next. The difficulty was increased by the application of tints of a different colour to a base shade of enamel before firing, so that the added colour blends gradually into the background colour {{around the edges of the}} tinted area. This is especially used on [...] "flux", or colourless enamel, as in the ground areas, rocks and trees. Flux was also used for flesh areas as on a gold background it darkens slightly when fired to a suitable colour for skin. The rouge clair or [...] "ruby glass" [...] red, used so effectively here, was made by adding tiny particles of copper, silver and gold to the glass; here scientific tests have shown that copper was used. After firing the enamel was polished {{flush with the}} surrounding metal. The technique had been known to the Ancient Romans (see the Lycurgus Cup, also in the British Museum), but was lost at the end of the Middle Ages until the 17thcentury. The added cylinders use opaque enamel, except for the red on the Tudor roses, which is translucent rouge clair, of a similar composition to the original reds. Translucent enamel is more fragile than opaque, and medieval survivals in good condition are very rare.|$|E
60|$|The {{nuisance}} {{of keeping}} a scrap-book is: 1. One never has paste or <b>gum</b> <b>tragacanth</b> handy; 2. Mucilage won't stick, or stay, 4 weeks; 3.

My idea is this: Make a scrap-book with leaves veneered or coated with gum-stickum of some kind; wet the page with sponge, brush, rag or tongue, and dab on your scraps like postage stamps.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{presence}} of gluten proteins in rice flour leads to some problems for patients of celiac; a digestive autoimmune disease. Consumption of a non-gluten regime can decrease {{the effects of}} this disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} produce a non-gluten cake with an appropriate quality and high nutritional value by using rice flour, quinoa flour, Persian <b>gums,</b> and <b>Tragacanth.</b> Methods: The effect of addition of Persian <b>gums,</b> <b>Tragacanth,</b> and a combination of both of these compounds at levels of 0. 5, 1, and 1. 5 % on texture, color, and sensory characteristics of these cakes was evaluated in this study. Results: The results showed that solidity and viscosity factors were elevated by addition of gum to cake. Using of gums in cakes leads to moisture maintenance inside the cake texture and thus improves mastication property. Furthermore, the results of porosity evaluation showed that addition of Persian <b>gums</b> and <b>Tragacanth</b> decreases the size and increases the number of gas cells inside the cake texture and improves porosity. The best porosity was related to the sample containing 1. 5 % Persian <b>gum</b> and <b>Tragacanth.</b> The treatment that contained 0. 75 % Persian gum and 0. 75 % Tragacanth had the highest acceptability among consumers. Conclusions: Results showed that Persian and <b>Tragacanth</b> <b>gums,</b> whether used independently or in combination, can improve the quality and organoleptic characteristics of gluten-free cakes...|$|R

They also have interesting therapeutic properties; for example gum arabic is antitussive and anti-inflammatory.

40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{quality of}} cakes made of wheat flour {{depends on the}} {{quantity}} and quality of its gluten proteins; however, these proteins may have side effects for some people, including the patients with celiac, and the only way to cure this disease is to take a lifelong gluten-free diet. Materials and Methods: This research aims to produce gluten- free cake by using rice flour and xanthan and <b>tragacanth</b> <b>gums,</b> including two treatments of xanthan gum (0. 5 & 1 %), two treatments of <b>tragacanth</b> <b>gum</b> (0. 5 & 1 %), four combination treatments of xanthan <b>gum</b> and <b>tragacanth,</b> and one control treatment (without gum). The effects of <b>tragacanth</b> and xanthan <b>gums</b> on the texture characteristics, moisture content, water activity (aw), color, volume, apparent density, and porosity of the resulting cake were investigated. The data obtained were analyzed by the use of factorial experiments with three replications (3 * 3) and a Completely Randomized Design (CRD). Results: The results showed that the treatments containing gum have less texture stiffness compared to the control. Among the treatments, those having the combination of 0. 5 % tragacanth and 1 % xanthan gum hold the maximum content of moisture. The L component amount of gluten-free cake samples was increased compared to the control while the rate of a and b components was decreased. The maximum amount of aw is related to the 0. 5 % treatment tragacanth and 1 % xanthan, and the lowest aw belongs to the control. Apparent and bulk density has a difference with the control, and the minimum amount and the maximum amount belong to the treatment containing 1 % tragacanth and the control, respectively. Conclusions: Samples containing 1 % xanthan and 0. 5 % tragacanth could be desirable due to less texture stiffness, maximum content of moisture and aw, high color score, minimum density, and better keeping quality during the storage period.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to find newly {{structured}} biopolymer blends bearing those adjustable features able to produce innovative materials. Apart from cellulose derivatives (cellulose carbamate and carboxymethyl cellulose), mannans (guar gum, locust bean <b>gum,</b> and <b>tragacanth</b> <b>gum),</b> xylan, starch (cationized), -carrageenan, and xanthan were chosen as blend polysaccharides for cellulose as matrix. In order to study their integration into the cellulose skeleton, fibers were shaped from three different solvents: NaOH by a special wet-spinning process, as well as N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) and 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate (EMIMac) via Lyocell technology. The structure and morphologies of the fibers were analyzed by X-ray wide-angle scattering and atomic force microscopy. Hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties were determined by means of a contact angle, as well as moisture content and water retention values, while the surface properties throughout zeta-potential mea surements. Being very different processes, the wet spinning in NaOH solution and the dry-wet spinning are deeply impacted by the types of solvent and polysaccharide. The X-ray results for NMMO fibers revealed the highest orientation compared with EMIMac having the lowest orientation of NaOH fibrous types. AFM images also show the lowest surface roughnesses for NMMO and EMIMac fibers. The moisture content and water retention values support these trends, while the water contact angle results show insignificant differences between the samples from EMIMac and NaOH, even though the values calculated for NMMO fibers were the lowest...|$|R
