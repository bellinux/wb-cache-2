50|$|Oxygen {{exists as}} a ground state triplet state, which is {{relatively}} unreactive and needs free radicals or very electron-rich substrates such as deprotonated lignin phenolic groups. The production of these phenoxide groups requires that <b>delignification</b> with oxygen {{be carried out}} under very basic conditions (pH >12). The reactions involved are primarily single electron (radical) reactions. Oxygen opens rings and cleaves sidechains giving a complex mixture of small oxygenated molecules. Transition metal compounds, particularly those ofiron, manganese and copper, which have multiple oxidation states, facilitate many radical reactions and impact oxygen <b>delignification.</b> While the radical reactions are largely responsible for <b>delignification,</b> they are detrimental to cellulose.Oxygen-based radicals, especially hydroxyl radicals, HO•, can oxidize hydroxyl groups in the cellulose chains to ketones, and under the strongly basic conditions used in oxygen <b>delignification,</b> these compounds undergo reverse aldol reactions leading to cleavage of cellulose chains.

50|$|Chemical pulps, such {{as those}} from the kraft process or sulfite pulping, contain much less lignin than {{mechanical}} pulps, (<5% compared to approximately 40%). The goal in bleaching chemical pulps is to remove essentially all of the residual lignin, hence the process {{is often referred to}} as <b>delignification.</b> Sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) was initially used to bleach chemical pulps, but was largely replaced in the 1930s by chlorine.

50|$|Using {{hydrogen}} peroxide to delignify chemical pulp requires more vigorous conditions than for brightening mechanical pulp. Both pH and temperature are higher when treating chemical pulp. The chemistry {{is very similar}} to that involved in oxygen <b>delignification,</b> in terms of the radical species involved and the products produced.

50|$|Pulp mills {{are almost}} always located near large bodies of water due to their former {{substantial}} demands. <b>Delignification</b> of chemical pulps released considerable amounts of organic material into the environment, particularly into rivers or lakes. The wastewater effluent {{can also be a}} major source of pollution, containing lignins from the trees, high biological oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), along with alcohols, chlorates, heavy metals, and chelating agents. Reducing the environmental impact of this effluent is accomplished by closing the loop and recycling the effluent where possible, as well as employing less damaging agents in the pulping and bleaching processes. The process effluents are treated in a biological effluent treatment plant, which guarantees that the effluents are not toxic in the recipient.|$|E
50|$|The brownstock {{from the}} blowing {{goes to the}} washing stages where the used cooking liquors are {{separated}} from the cellulose fibers. Normally a pulp mill has 3-5 washing stages in series. Washing stages are also placed after oxygen <b>delignification</b> and between the bleaching stages as well. Pulp washers use counter current flow between the stages such that the pulp moves {{in the opposite direction}} to the flow of washing waters. Several processes are involved: thickening / dilution, displacement and diffusion. The dilution factor is the measure of the amount of water used in washing compared with the theoretical amount required to displace the liquor from the thickened pulp. Lower dilution factor reduces energy consumption, while higher dilution factor normally gives cleaner pulp. Thorough washing of the pulp reduces the chemical oxygen demand (COD).|$|E

Typically, <b>delignification</b> requires several hours at [...] Under these conditions lignin and hemicellulose degrade to give fragments that are soluble in the strongly basic liquid. The solid pulp (about 50% by weight of the dry wood chips) is collected and washed. At this point the pulp is known as brown stock because of its color.

30|$|Enzymatic <b>delignification</b> is the {{application}} of enzymatic extracts and purified or semi-purified ligninolytic enzymes to realize the lignin degradation. Enzymatic <b>delignification</b> employs commercial or native ligninolytic enzymes [63]. Laccase is the most utilized enzyme followed by MnP and LiP; nevertheless, mixtures {{of two or three}} ligninolytic enzymes have been used for some <b>delignification</b> pretreatments. In those cases, the synergetic relationship between the ligninolytic enzymes improved biomass <b>delignification</b> [64, 65]. In wheat straw, ligninolytic enzymes generated a reduction in the cellulose conversion during the saccharification process. To avoid cellulases’ inhibition, ligninolytic enzymes were deactivated before the saccharification process [66]. Similar to fungal <b>delignification,</b> alkali pretreatments have been used in enzymatic <b>delignification</b> as an initial pretreatment to facilitate the <b>delignification</b> process [66]. Enzymatic processes achieved similar <b>delignification</b> percentages than microbial pretreatment.

40|$|For a <b>delignification</b> {{reaction}} to occur, cooking chemicals must be {{transported to the}} reaction site. After fragmentation reactions in the lignin structure, lignin fragments need to be solubilised in order to diffuse out of the fibre wall and complete the complicated <b>delignification</b> reaction. Despite major research efforts, there are still several aspects of this complex process that are not fully understood. This study {{is part of a}} larger investigation aimed at increasing the knowledge of the reaction kinetics of a kraft cook. In the present paper, different aspects of reaction kinetics of <b>delignification</b> and approaches to the modelling of kraft <b>delignification</b> are discussed. In the experimental part, the effect of active chemical concentrations on the reaction kinetics of <b>delignification</b> of Scots pine (Pinus silvestris) was investigated at five temperature levels. Cooks with the addition of an industrial softwood black liquor and increased sodium ion concentration were also performed. To minimise the influence of mass transport on the reaction rates, wood meal was used as a substrate and all cooks were conducted at a high liquor-to-wood ratio (200 : 1) to minimise the deviation from initial bulk concentrations. The rate of <b>delignification</b> in the kraft cook increased with increasing hydrosulphide ion and hydroxide ion concentrations. An increase in sodium ion concentration retarded the rate of <b>delignification,</b> while an increase in concentration of dissolved kraft lignin in the cooking liquor increased the <b>delignification</b> rate during the main part of the cook. These results qualitatively resemble many of the results found in the literature. Indications of the influence of covalent bonds between lignin and carbohydrates on the <b>delignification</b> rate are shown and discussed.
