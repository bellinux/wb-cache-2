40|$|Abstract: The options {{markets and}} earlier studies take the Black-Scholes Generalized Model (BSG) as the {{practical}} model and develop more prospering. However, BSG is {{also based on}} many assumptions and constrains such that derivatives valuation with this model shows miss-pricing seriously, especially while compared with the market prices in foreign exchange options market. In order to overcome the drawbacks derived from BSG, we employ the proposed options pricing model through enhanced neural-fuzzy-based inference systems (ENFIS) in options pricing and then compared with the BSG. The evidence from empirical studies is using the <b>euro</b> foreign exchange <b>options</b> listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The performance valuating comparisons were focused in the research period from 2002 to 2005. The {{results show that the}} ENFIS framework is superior to the BSG no matter in error degree or in the interpretation capability.

The evaluation of the solutions was based on the calculated parameters: a monetary value reflecting the energy cost of the analyzed buses and the ecological effect of the reduced emissions from the Euro VI bus and the electric bus compared with the Euro III vehicle. The ecological effect resulting from the use of the electric bus was determined taking into account emissions from fossil fuels (coal, natural gas) and biomass. The method of cost analysis was used to evaluate the solution of replacing older buses with new ones (with different types of propulsion).

40|$|One {{section of}} the Greek left converged on a {{strategy}} of default and exiting the euro, together with restructuring the economy through devaluation, nationalization of the banks and the renationalization of public utilities, industrial policies etc. At the intellectual level this approach gained powerful support {{from a number of}} Greek academics working abroad. At the political level the exit strategy was promoted as a central policy plank by the extra-parliamentary left, especially Antarsya, but also found a strong, albeit minority, support within some sections of Syriza (see Kouvelakis, 2011, p. 30) 1. The forces coalescing around the exit strategy obviously had internal differences and we cannot hope to do justice to all the nuances here. Rather we shall focus on the arguments as presented by those providing the intellectual gravitas to the exit strategy. The exit strategy has two main elements. The first relies on a deconstruction of any argument that the EU provides any privileged terrain for left wing strategies. The second relies on showing how debt default and withdrawing from the euro provide the indispensable starting point for such strategies. Thus the first report published in 2010 from the Research in Money and Finance Group, based in SOAS, argued that the “good <b>euro</b> ” <b>option</b> (for instanc...|$|R
40|$|We fit the {{volatility}} fluctuations of the S&P 500 index well by a Chi distribution, {{and the distribution}} of log-returns by a corresponding superposition of Gaussian distributions. The Fourier transform of this is, remarkably, of the Tsallis type. An option pricing formula is derived from the same superposition of Black-Scholes expressions. An explicit analytic formula is deduced from a perturbation expansion around a Black-Scholes formula with the mean volatility. The expansion has two parts. The first takes into account the non-Gaussian character of the stock-fluctuations and is organized by powers of the excess kurtosis, the second is contract based, and is organized by the moments of moneyness of the option. With this expansion we show that for the Dow Jones <b>Euro</b> Stoxx 50 <b>option</b> data, a Delta-hedging strategy is close to being optimal. ...|$|R

40|$|Background and aims: The Belgian Social Security Institute (hereafter INAMI) {{proposes a}} list of {{conditions}} to {{be considered as a}} prerequisite for reimbursement of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) measurements. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the proposed criteria for identifying osteoporosis, and to gauge how useful they are for more rational application of densitometry tests. Methods: 3748 Caucasian women aged at least 50 years old were recruited consecutively from an outpatient university center, from the database of which all relevant data corresponding to the INAMI list of clinical factors, as well as patients' age, weight and height, were collected. BMD measurements using dual X-ray absorptiometry were reported at the spine and hip regions. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated through measures of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). Additionally, from ROC analysis, benchmark values for age and body mass index were identified and then, used alone and in combination with the INAMI test, were applied to define various screening strategies. For each of them, associated costs per osteoporotic patient detected were estimated. Cost estimates refer only to the costs associated with the densitometric procedure {{from the perspective of the}} reimbursement health authorities. Results: Applying INAMI criteria for detecting osteoporosis at any of the considered sites yielded sensitivity of 68. 9 %, specificity of 50. 7 %, PPV of 42. 9 % and NPV of 57. 3 %. Comparison of incremental costs per patient of the different strategies revealed that, with 67. 1 <b>Euros,</b> the <b>option</b> of opening BMD coverage to women on the basis of the INAMI conditions would be more cost-effective than mass screening (90. 1 Euros) or applying the age criterion alone (70. 2 Euros). However, the BMI condition seems to act as a better indicator of risk than the INAMI criteria in those meeting the age condition (35. 4 Euros). Conclusions: The accuracy of the INAMI proposal turns out to be quite unsatisfactory, and did not adequately cover the population at risk of osteoporosis. From a resource allocation perspective, the best strategy by far would be to recommend using concomitantly INAMI, age and BMI-selective criteria. Some adaptations could enhance the usefulness of the INAMI proposals as a selective approach for BMD referral and reimbursement. © 2004, Editrice Kurtis...|$|R
500|$|True Finns {{have said}} that Finland should not financially support the European Financial Stability Facility that led to bailouts for Ireland and Greece. Timo Soini asked: [...] "How come they (the European Union) can't see the euro doesn't work?" [...] The party {{manifesto}} {{said that they would}} support a capital gains tax increase from 28% to 30% and an increased tax on alcohol. The party also opposed mention of Finland's EU membership in the constitution and want to cut social welfare for immigrants. Soini also suggested Finland should unilaterally withdraw from the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and some other international commitments and that giving up the <b>euro</b> was an <b>option.</b> While speculating about a possible ministerial portfolio he later backed down on commitments when journalists asked him if the issues would be True Finns' demands in any possible government formation talks, citing the proposals as his personal opinion and not necessarily incorporated into a prospective government policy programme. He continued to maintain that the EU membership issue in the constitution would be a threshold for their participation in government formation talks. Helsingin Sanomat suggested that these demands could prove detrimental to a chance for True Finns to join a governing coalition. The True Finns also support the continuation of social welfare benefits. The party's support for the benefits along with its stance on the EU bailouts was also seen as one reason for its growth in popularity {{at a time when the}} country was facing welfare cuts by the government. The True Finns' vice-chairman Vesa-Matti Saarakkala said that [...] "the True Finns will not participate in a coalition government with any party ready to give further loan guarantees". This stance on the EU's bailout was read by The Wall Street Journal as detrimental to the euro zone's attempt to reassure bond investors that it would not face debt problems. It also said that a good showing for the True Finns could threaten Portugal's EU-sponsored bailout.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the comparative magnitude of disturbances in intraday data for exchange traded foreign exchange (FX) options. An in-depth {{time series analysis}} on the frequency and extent of discrepancies in the disturbances is conducted. The {{purpose of this study}} is twofold. First, using intraday data and trading volume, this study attempts to determine whether both put-call parity and lower boundary conditions consistently hold for exchange traded options written on U. S. dollar denominated <b>options</b> on the <b>Euro</b> trading on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX). Second, this study attempts to investigate the magnitude of any discrepancies that may exist due to a temporary cessation of either put-call parity or lower boundary conditions. Intraday (tick-by-tick) bid prices, ask prices, and trading volume on U. S. dollar denominated European style call options and put <b>options</b> on the <b>Euro</b> are obtained. <b>Option</b> data is collected through a Structured Query Language (SQL) request from the Bloomberg database. Corresponding tick-by-tick spot rates for the underlying exchange rate are obtained for the same time period. Tick-by-tick 3 -month Treasury bill rates are obtained to for use as the relevant risk-free interest rate. The primary data set spans an approximate one month period from 11 / 1 / 2011 to 12 / 6 / 2011. Call and option pricing data for near-the-money exercise prices are obtained for options expiring in December 2011, January 2012, February 2012, March 2012, June 2012, and September 2012. A total of 7, 212 ticks (minutes) are analyzed for the conversion strategy and 7, 209 ticks are analyzed for the reversal strategy. The data is structured into an unbalanced panel data set (cross-sectional time series data) using put-call pairs as the cross sectional units and ticks as the time-series unit. To test the efficiency of the foreign exchange options market, lower boundary and put-call parity conditions were tested on tick-by-tick currency option data. Analysis shows that lower boundary conditions hold for the overwhelming majority of options, with less than 0. 0001 % of violations for the observed options. A more detailed econometric analysis was prepared to test the put-call parity condition for currency options. A fixed effects model specification is used to describe the put-call parity relationship. Based on the analysis, it is possible to obtain arbitrage profits in the short run through the use of either a conversion or reversal strategy even after accounting for transaction costs. Taking the first differences of the variables resulted in a model with stationary variables and statistically significant estimators. The inclusion of dummy variables for moneyness did not add significant explanatory power to the deterministic put-call parity relationship. For both first differences of conversion and reversal strategies, the large t-statistics for the slope coefficients and intercept terms indicate a rejection of the null hypothesis, H 0 : λ 0 = 0 and λ 1 = 1 after adjusting for standard error. This implies that once transaction costs are adjusted for, put-call parity does not hold. However, the intercept term is only very slightly negative, and the intercept term is only slightly less than one in both cases. This implies that when put-call parity is violated, arbitrage profit should be relatively small...|$|R
