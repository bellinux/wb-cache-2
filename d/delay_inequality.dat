In contrast to that theorem, we stress that the next theorem does not require the existence of auxiliary functions (as in condition (2.5)) and, moreover, the nonexistence of solutions of type (I) and (II) is ensured by means of only one condition.|$|E
30|$|It is {{well known}} that the theory of {{differential}} inequalities {{plays an important role in}} the qualitative and quantitative studies of differential equations [1 – 3]. In recent years, various inequalities have been established such as the Halanay inequalities in [4 – 6], the <b>delay</b> <b>inequalities</b> in [7 – 10], and the impulsive differential inequalities in [11 – 13]. Using the linear inequality techniques, many results have been done on the stability and dynamical behavior for differential systems, see [4 – 13] and the references cited therein. For example, [11] presents an extended impulsive <b>delay</b> Halanay <b>inequality</b> and deals with the global exponential stability of impulsive Hopfield neural networks with time delays. In [13], the authors establish a <b>delay</b> differential <b>inequality</b> with impulsive initial conditions and derive some sufficient conditions ensuring the exponential stability of solutions for the impulsive differential equations. However, linear differential inequalities do not work in the studies for nonlinear differential equations. With the development of the theory on nonlinear differential equations (e.g., see [14, 15]), it is necessary to study the corresponding nonlinear differential inequalities. In [16], the authors develop a new nonlinear <b>delay</b> differential <b>inequality</b> that works well in studying a class of nonlinear delay differential systems. Indeed, nonlinear <b>delay</b> differential <b>inequalities</b> with impulses are seldom discussed in the literature. Therefore, in further researches of nonlinear systems, it is beneficial to obtain some new nonlinear impulsive <b>delay</b> differential <b>inequalities.</b> Our goal in this article is to do some investigations on such problems.|$|R
