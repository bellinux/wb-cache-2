5|$|The city's {{architectural}} planning authorities {{continue to}} take full account of these priorities. Special attention is given both to climate issues and efforts to ensure maximum application of low-energy standards. Priorities include sustainable drainage systems, recycling rainwater, green roofs and efficient waste management solutions. In city planning, streets and squares are to be <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> cycling and walking rather than driving.|$|E
50|$|The hotel {{included}} an open <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> airflow throughout {{the building and}} keep it cool; its primary feature was an open rotunda at the center that extended from the first to the fourth floors and culminated in a domed skylight.|$|R
50|$|In both {{online and}} {{face-to-face}} tutoring, similarities {{lie in the}} areas of group dynamics, need for roles within the group and <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> in-group interaction.

5|$|Any rider {{may take}} {{unlimited}} trips {{of up to}} 30 minutes, measured from when the bike is withdrawn from a dock to when it is returned. (If a destination station is full, riders can use the kiosk to get 15 more free minutes to return the bike to another location.) Longer trips incur fees for each additional half-hour {{on a scale that}} rises from $1.50 to $8.00. These prices are <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> short trips from place to place instead of longer leisure rides.|$|E
5|$|The Cycle Center is <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> bicycle {{commuting}} to Millennium and Grant Parks {{as well as}} to work and other nearby downtown locations, such as the Art Institute of Chicago. It represents two major initiatives by the mayor: to promote cycling and to make the city greener. By supporting cycling as an alternate form of transportation, it will help reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality and promote the health benefits of cycling.|$|E
5|$|The General Douglas MacArthur Foundation {{presents}} the MacArthur Cadet Awards {{in recognition of}} outstanding cadets within the Association of Military Colleges and Schools of the United States. The MacArthur Award is presented annually to seniors at these military schools. The award is <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> cadets to emulate the leadership qualities shown by General Douglas MacArthur, {{as a student at}} West Texas Military Institute and the U.S. Military Academy. Approximately 40 schools are authorized to provide the award to its top cadet each year.|$|E
25|$|<b>To</b> <b>encourage</b> {{participation}} in racing and also engage the restoration process which remained true {{to the spirit}} of the original design, the 12 Metre class association introduced a handicapping system to allow 12 Metres of all ages to race together on a more equal footing.

5|$|In Giants: Citizen Kabuto, players take on {{the roles}} of three {{humanoid}} races: gun-toting Meccaryns, magic-wielding Sea Reapers, and the gigantic Kabuto. Each player is assigned direct control of a single character. The game's developers, Planet Moon Studios, created this <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> players <b>to</b> focus on the action {{and not to be}} burdened with micromanagement. Players can customize the controls, which are largely the same for each race, with slight differences for abilities.|$|R
5|$|The city of Gifu is {{currently}} promoting the Slow Life City Initiative, {{which is similar}} to, but more comprehensive than, the slow food initiative. It is <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> residents to lead a slower lifestyles and provide {{an alternative to the}} fast-paced life of the modern world. Major elements of this campaign include more dependence on locally grown food; traditional culture and arts; and activities to increase citizens’ participation in their community. In addition to slow food, Gifu also hopes to include slow industry (traditional crafts), slow education (studying quality of life), and slow tourism (represented by cormorant fishing).|$|E
5|$|During the inter-war years Calshot {{was taken}} over by the Royal Air Force, {{becoming}} RAF Calshot. It was used as the School for Naval Co-operation and Aerial Navigation from 1918 onwards and began housing the Seaplane Training Squadron in 1931. The 1895 battery was demolished to create additional space for the growing station, and a narrow-gauge railway constructed along the spit. Parts of the castle moat were concreted over to provide parking for planes. Calshot twice hosted the Schneider Trophy air races over the Solent, the last two in the sequence of popular international events <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> the development of new, high-speed technology. The Empire Air Day events were also held at Calshot, attracting 1,000 visitors in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Although Hergé {{wanted to}} send Tintin to the United States, Wallez ordered him to set his {{adventure}} in the Soviet Union, acting as anti-socialist propaganda for children. The result, Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, was serialised in Le Petit Vingtième from January 1929 to May 1930. Popular in Francophone Belgium, Wallez organised a publicity stunt at the Gare du Nord station, following which he organised {{the publication of the}} story in book form. The story's popularity led to an increase in sales, so Wallez granted Hergé two assistants. At Wallez's direction, in June he began serialisation of the second story, Tintin in the Congo, <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> colonial sentiment towards the Belgian Congo. Authored in a paternalistic style that depicted the Congolese as childlike idiots, in later decades it was accused of racism, however at the time was un-controversial and popular, and further publicity stunts were held to increase sales.|$|E

5|$|Some space opera {{doctrines of}} Scientology are only {{provided}} by the church to experienced members, who church leaders maintain {{are the only ones}} able to correctly understand them. Several former members of the church have exposed these secret documents, leading to lengthy court battles with the church, which failed to keep the secret. Critics of the church have noted that some of the narratives are scientifically impossible, and have thus assailed the church as untrustworthy for teaching them. The space opera teachings have also been satirized in popular culture. Scholars of religion have described the space opera narratives as a creation myth <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> reverence of Hubbard as a supreme messenger. Several academics have drawn attention to the similarity of the space opera myths to themes of the 1950s Cold War culture in which they were constructed.|$|E
5|$|The {{new town}} of Caernarfon was {{populated}} by English settlers, particularly from nearby Cheshire and Lancashire, {{and the town}} walls were in part <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> immigrants and royal officials to settle there in safety. The town of Caernarfon did not prove a successful settlement, however; by 1298 it had only 59 burgage tenementsproperties paying rent to the kingmaking it far less prosperous than either neighbouring Conwy or Beaumaris, and the situation did not improve during the 14th century. In 1400 Welsh prince Owain Glyndŵr rose in rebellion against English rule, but despite attempts to take Caernarfon in 1403 and 1404, the town's defences held out. The ascension of the Tudor dynasty to the English throne resulted in {{a change in the}} way Wales was administered. The Tudors were Welsh in origin, and their rule lessened hostilities between the Welsh and English, reducing the need to maintain Caernarfon's castle and walls and easing the restrictions on Welsh access to the townthe Welsh were finally allowed to live inside Caernarfon in 1507.|$|E
5|$|The {{new town}} of Conwy was {{populated}} by English settlers, particularly from nearby Cheshire and Lancashire, {{and the town}} walls were in part <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> immigrants to settle there in safety. The town of Conwy was only modestly successful, however; by 1312 it had 124 burgage tenements – properties paying rent to the king – making it more successful than neighbouring Caernarfon, but less so than Beaumaris. Welsh residents appear to have slowly arrived inside the town during the 14th century, and even then were subject to considerable suspicion. Protecting the town remained a priority and during this period the constable charged with {{the security of the}} castle was also the mayor of Conwy, although protecting the town walls was probably the duty of the citizens rather than the forces attached to the castle. The walls were guarded by crossbowmen, and improved firing positions for them were built into the town walls {{at the start of the}} 14th century.|$|E

5|$|Grand Forks has {{an active}} sister city program <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> {{cultural}} and economic exchanges. Grand Forks' first sister city was Ishim in the Soviet Union. The relationship with the Siberian city formally began in 1984 during the Cold War. Sometime in the late 1990s, however, political and economic turmoil in Russia ended the relationship. While the relationship with Ishim faded, Grand Forks found a new sister in Awano, Japan. An informal relationship began in 1994 when the school districts of both cities began exchanging students. In 1998, the two formally proclaimed themselves sister cities. The most concrete evidence {{of the relationship between}} the two is a Japanese rock garden in Grand Forks' Sertoma Park and a sculpture of an American bison in an Awano park. However, the annexation of Awano by the larger city of Kanuma has led to the end of the sister city relationship. Grand Forks' relationship with Dickinson, North Dakota, began in 2002, when delegations from each city visited the other. Grand Forks Mayor Michael Brown has said he thinks having friends in western North Dakota, which typically has diverging interests from eastern cities, could help at the state legislature. Sarpsborg, Norway, became a sister city in 2005 following several exchanges among leaders from both cities. The city became interested in building a relationship with Sarpsborg because many Grand Forks residents have Norwegian heritage.|$|E

5000|$|Enthusiast reports {{describe}} the TIM used by Intel as low-quality, and {{not up to}} par for a [...] "premium" [...] CPU, with some speculation that this is by <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> sales of prior processors. Further analyses caution that the processor can be damaged or void its warranty if home users attempt to remedy the matter. The TIM has much lower thermal conductivity, causing heat to trap on the die. Experiments with replacing this TIM with a higher-quality one or other heat removal methods showed a substantial temperature drop, and improvements to the increased voltages and overclocking sustainable by Ivy Bridge chips.|$|R
