40|$|Abstract: Largely as a {{response}} to critiques of top-down development and of a growing awareness of the low effectiveness of aid absorption in poor countries, the international donor community has recently adopted with enthusiasm and determination a new approach to fight poverty, called the community-based development approach (CBD). Such an abrupt shift in aid strategies is questionable, not because the approach is wrong (the opposite is actually the case), but because massive injections of aid funds in CBD projects, the entry into the field of numerous agencies with little or no experience in participatory development, as well as the pressing need for quick and visible results, threaten to undermine its effectiveness in reducing poverty. The cause for worry comes from the ‘elite capture’ problem that risks deflecting {{a large portion of the}} resources devoted to CBD into the hands of powerful groups dominating target communities. On the basis of a game-theoretical model, the main aim of the paper is to discuss the use of sequential and conditional <b>disbursement</b> <b>procedures</b> as a way of surmounting such a problem, and to examine how the share of CBD aid reaching the poor is influenced by various elements of the aid environment, including the pressure of competition among donor agencies and the availability of aid funds. Multilateral reputation mechanisms and intra-community competition for leadership are also assessed as possible alternatives to sequential <b>disbursement</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{third and}} most {{important}} question was the determinants of credit rationing of SMEs. Out of the sampled 200 SMEs, 111 of them applied for loan and 89 did not apply for the loan from formal FIs. Descriptive statistics {{was used to examine}} the credit rationing category’s firms. 111 firms applied for the loan, out of total 96 received loan and 15 of them were rejected. Again, out of the 96 firms 50 received full amount applied for but 46 of the firms received less than the amount requested. Firms received lesser amounts than desired for their risky ventures (33  %), lack of sound financial statement (28  %), business sector bias (17  %) and lack of collateral (14  %). Using DEM, we also categorize firms based on their response to a qualitative question. So as per DEM, 25  % of the firms were unconstrained non-borrowers, 28  % unconstrained borrowers, 19  % quantity rationed borrowers and 28  % risk rationed borrowers. After DEM, we employed multinomial logit regression to see the determinants of credit ration of SMEs. The result shows that education, firm age, marital status, initial outlay, the number of employees and education do not have any impact on credit rationing. Age and gender of the owners of the firms, the status of the house, heads of household, workplace and household size have the impact on credit rationing. From the discussion in our study, the issues that we raised in terms of policy from the descriptive results and cross analysis are: interest rate, application cost, the number of paper documents, rigid rules and regulations, loan <b>disbursement</b> <b>procedure,</b> loan amount and duration, collateral, financial statement, project feasibility, risk management techniques and irretrievable risky business.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} in the {{aftermath}} of the global economic crisis, the centralized international monetary architecture or the global financial safety net (GFSN) set up at the Bretton Woods conference is evolving towards a more decentralized multilayered safety net comprising (i) the G 20 at the apex as an overarching institution, (ii) multilateral financial safety nets (MFSNs) established under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), (iii) bilateral financial safety nets (BFSNs) among central banks, (iv) regional financial safety nets (RFSNs) established in various regions of the world, and (v) national financial safety nets (NFSNs) or reserve accumulation by individual countries. The most significant factor explaining this evolution is financial globalization and the increased incidence of capital account crisis. As in many other regions of the world, Asia has established the ASEAN+ 3 RFSN, comprising the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) and ASEAN+ 3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO), for crisis prevention and management.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to assess {{international}} donors’ attempts to use aid to promote peace in Sri Lanka. International donors have on several occasions {{made it clear that}} they will apply peace conditionality in order to propel the peace process forward. What is clear, however, is that the strategy has not been successful: the peace process derailed already in April 2003, and the situation continued to deteriorate throughout 2003 and 2004. Today, five years after the signing of the CFA, the peace process hangs in the balance of a fragile no-war-no-peace situation. This thesis is based on the presupposition that peace conditionality can be an important pacifying tool. On that basis, the purpose of the thesis is to assess why donors’ strategy has not had the intended effects in Sri Lanka. Why have donors not been able to buy peace? Have donors’ intentions to link aid to peace been carried out in practice? And if yes, why have the specific strategies and approaches failed? The analysis shows that donors increased disbursements to Sri Lanka as the peace process seemed to be moving in the right direction. However, donors failed to link aid disbursements to developments in the peace process once the situation on the ground deteriorated. In other words, donors were willing to dangle the carrot, but they were never willing to apply the stick. Donors did certainly note the poor state of the peace process, but this was not reflected in actual disbursements. Sri Lanka did largely receive the aid that was promised at the donor conferences in Oslo and Tokyo, despite the failure by the parties to comply with the conditions attached to <b>disbursements.</b> Unclear <b>procedures</b> and mechanisms reduced donors’ ability to implement peace conditionality. The vagueness of the conditions made it difficult for donors to assess to what extent the parties complied, and monitoring soon became a sensitive issue. Furthermore, the institutional set-up of donors made it difficult to respond promptly and flexibly to developments in the peace process. Most importantly, however, the analysis shows that major donors were unwilling to prioritise peace over other foreign policy goals. It was more important for donors to preserve the good relationship with the parties, or to combat terrorism, than it was to enforce the conditions attached to disbursements. The application of the stick did not fit into the broader relationship between the donors and the conflicting parties, and donors consequently made little effort to enforce the conditions attached to disbursements. Peace conditionality in Sri Lanka was only attempted in a half hearted way...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT A students’ Loan {{scheme is}} one among many {{alternatives}} for financing {{higher education in}} various countries around the world. Tanzania {{is one of the}} countries that have been practicing loan scheme system for financing higher education sub-sector. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the performance of the students’ loan scheme in Tanzania basing on the views of the stakeholders, mostly higher education students who are the main beneficiaries of the scheme. Some university students at the University of Dar es Salaam, the policy makers and policy implementers in the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology and the Higher Education Student Loan Board respectively, were identified for the study. The study was guided by two research questions. These are: what is the performance of higher education student loan scheme in terms of the procedures for loan application and money disbursement; and does the student loan scheme contain the structures for loan recovery to the extent of being able to recover the loan? A qualitative strategy has been used in this study. Multiple methods were used for data collection, namely semi-structured interview, group discussion and documentary analysis. Twelve students of different academic years of study and student leaders at the student organization level, two policy makers and two policy implementers were interviewed. Twenty students were involved in a focused group discussion. And various documents including policy documents, guidelines and website documents were analyzed. Data collected was analyzed by induction process. The findings show that the loan scheme in Tanzania is partly not performing well in terms of application <b>procedures,</b> <b>disbursement</b> of funds to students and loan recovery. Therefore to make the loan scheme perform at the convenience of the stakeholders, it is recommended that the government should decentralize the HESLB to district level (establish the district offices). By doing so some services such as distribution and collection of loan application forms and means-testing can be done at the district offices. In addition, it is recommended that the loan application forms can also be stationed at Advanced Secondary Schools to make it easy for the applicants to access them as most of the applicants are students from these schools...|$|R
