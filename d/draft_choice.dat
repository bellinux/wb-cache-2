50|$|Vancouver {{would make}} a trade with the Los Angeles Lakers, as the Grizzlies would acquire Anthony Peeler and George Lynch along with the Lakers second round <b>draft</b> <b>choices</b> in 1997 and 1998 for Vancouver's second round <b>draft</b> <b>choices</b> in 1997 and 1998. Peeler would start 57 games for the Grizzlies in the 1996-97 season and finish third in team scoring {{averaging}} 14.5 points per game.|$|R
5|$|Before the 1994 season, Reeves named Dave Brown, who {{had been}} a #1 {{supplemental}} <b>draft</b> <b>choice</b> in 1992, the Giants starting quarterback. Though Brown led the Giants to wins in their first three games, they lost their next seven. The Giants recovered to win their last six games of the season, but missed the playoffs. During the winning streak, they never allowed more than 20 points in a game.|$|E
5|$|Though he {{was drafted}} by the Rangers in 1989, Miller opted to go to {{university}} and complete his degree. It was {{while he was at}} university that Miller was traded by the Rangers. On January 17, 1991, he was sent to the Quebec Nordiques along with the Rangers 5th round <b>draft</b> <b>choice</b> (Bill Lindsay) in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft for Joe Cirella.|$|E
5|$|The New York Mets drafted Humber {{with the}} third overall <b>draft</b> <b>choice</b> in that year's amateur draft.

50|$|On October 31, 1987, the Los Angeles Rams traded Eric Dickerson to the Indianapolis Colts in a three team trade {{involving}} the Buffalo Bills. The Rams sent Dickerson to the Colts for six <b>draft</b> <b>choices</b> and two players. Buffalo obtained {{the rights to}} Cornelius Bennett from Indianapolis. Buffalo sent running back Greg Bell and three <b>draft</b> <b>choices</b> to the Rams, while Indianapolis added Owen Gill and three of their own draft picks to complete the deal with the Rams.|$|R
5|$|After the 1973 {{season the}} team fired Webster, who later {{admitted}} {{his heart was}} never in head coaching, and said he more enjoyed life as an assistant. They hired retired star defensive end Andy Robustelli to run their football operations, and he picked Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger as the team's head coach. Arnsparger had built an enviable reputation as {{the architect of the}} Dolphins defense which helped the team to two Super Bowl championships. Robustelli traded their 1975 first round <b>draft</b> <b>choice</b> to the Cowboys (who used it to select Hall of Fame defensive lineman Randy White) for quarterback Craig Morton {{in the middle of the}} 1974 season.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1999 {{season the}} Giants signed quarterback Kerry Collins. Collins {{had been the}} first-ever <b>draft</b> <b>choice</b> of the {{expansion}} Carolina Panthers and {{in his second season}} led the Panthers to the NFC Championship game. However, problems with alcohol, conflicts with his teammates and questions about his character led to his release from the Panthers. Mike Ditka, coach of the New Orleans Saints signed him after his release; however the experiment failed and Collins was released again. Although many people, including Sports Illustrated football beat writer Peter King questioned the wisdom of Accorsi and the Giants giving Collins a US$16.9 million contract, especially when there was little interest for Collins's services league-wide, Accorsi was confident that Collins was a wise investment.|$|E
5|$|Before the season, Toronto won the NBA Draft Lottery {{and were}} awarded the 1st overall {{pick in the}} 2006 NBA draft. To prepare for their <b>draft</b> <b>choice,</b> the Raptors traded Rafael Araújo for Kris Humphries and Robert Whaley, and traded Matt Bonner, Eric Williams and a second round pick for Rasho Nesterovič and cash considerations. The 1st overall pick was used to select Italian Andrea Bargnani, making him the first European drafted number one overall. Maurizio Gherardini was hired as the club's {{vice-president}} and assistant general manager, making him the first European elevated to an NBA executive job. Promising small forward Charlie Villanueva was traded for point guard T. J. Ford and cash considerations, while Chris Bosh was rewarded with a three-year extension.|$|E

5|$|Phil's {{parents are}} Elizabeth (Liz) and Paul Pressey. Together they have four children: Ashley, Angela, Paul Jr. (known by his middle name of Matthew) and Phillip. Paul was an NCAA {{basketball}} All-American, National Invitation Tournament Champion, NBA All-Defensive Team selection, JUCO National champion and a first round NBA <b>Draft</b> <b>choice.</b> Phil was teammates with {{his older brother}} Matt for two years at Missouri. , Matt is playing with the Plymouth Raiders in the British Basketball League. Their older sister Angie was an All-American volleyball player for the California Golden Bears. Pressey wore cornrows throughout his high school basketball career. Pressey was a childhood friend and AAU teammate of Alex Oriakhi who transferred from Connecticut after playing for the 2010–11 national champion Huskies team to join the 2012–13 Tigers.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers signed their first-ever {{free agents}} in January: former Birmingham Americans and Nebraska guard Tom Alward, Denver Broncos and Notre Dame {{defensive}} end Pete Duranko, and Chicago Bears wide receiver Wayne Wheeler. Having not selected a {{quarterback in the}} veteran allocation draft, they addressed that need in their first-ever trade, a deal to get local favorite Steve Spurrier from the San Francisco 49ers. The former Heisman Trophy winner was obtained for a second-round <b>draft</b> <b>choice</b> {{and two of the}} veteran draftees, Bruce Elia and Willie McGee. An earlier attempt to obtain a quarterback failed when the team sent a future draft pick to the Saints for backup quarterback Larry Cipa, only to waive him when he failed his physical. The Buccaneers also used a third-round pick to obtain defensive back Mike Washington from the Baltimore Colts.|$|E
5|$|The Giants regressed to an 8–8 {{record in}} 1998. The {{strength}} of the team during the season was their defense, which featured two Pro Bowlers in Armstead and Strahan. However, the offense continued to struggle. Dave Brown had been released before the season and replaced by Kanell and Kent Graham. However, neither quarterback provided Pro Bowl-caliber play. Before the 1999 season, the Giants signed quarterback Kerry Collins. Collins had been the first–ever <b>draft</b> <b>choice</b> of the Carolina Panthers, and in his second season, {{led them to the}} NFC Championship game. However, problems with alcohol abuse, conflicts with his teammates, and questions about his character led to his release from the Panthers. Although many people questioned the wisdom of Accorsi and the Giants giving Collins a $16.9 million contract, Accorsi was confident in Collins' abilities.|$|E

50|$|After waiving Stewart, the Cowboys {{threatened}} to waive the other Vikings players {{that came in}} the Herschel Walker trade, {{in order to get}} all of the conditional draft picks. Head coach Jimmy Johnson eventually had second thoughts on the February 1 deadline and traded three future <b>draft</b> <b>choices</b> (third-round and tenth-round in 1990 and a third-round in 1991) to the Vikings for the right to retain the original full package of <b>draft</b> <b>choices,</b> plus Issiac Holt, Jesse Solomon and David Howard.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, he didn't start {{because there}} were {{conditional}} draft picks attached to the Vikings traded players and the Dallas Cowboys wanted the selections instead of keeping Holt and the others. Head coach Jimmy Johnson eventually had second thoughts on the February 1 deadline and traded three future <b>draft</b> <b>choices</b> (third-round and tenth-round in 1990 and a third-round in 1991) to the Vikings {{for the right to}} retain the original full package of <b>draft</b> <b>choices,</b> plus Holt, Jesse Solomon and David Howard.|$|R
5|$|The late preseason saw {{a wave of}} signings {{of players}} cut by other teams, {{particularly}} the Bengals and Colts. Signees included Isaac Hagins, Danny Reece, Dave Green, and Jack Novak, with Ira Gordon and camp standout Jim Cagle among those waived to make roster space for them. Running back Charlie Davis was also obtained via trade. The moves left the team with nine former Bengals on their roster, a situation they expected, as they knew that Bengals owner Paul Brown had more young talent than {{he would be able}} to keep on his team. Linebacker Richard Wood was obtained from the New York Jets for a future <b>draft</b> <b>choice,</b> with injury-plagued running back Harold Hart placed on injured reserve to make roster space for him. Wood was the final roster addition of the preseason, and became the fifth ex-USC player on the roster.|$|E
5|$|As the D-League season wound down, Rice {{emerged as}} a sleeper <b>draft</b> <b>choice</b> for the 2013 NBA draft. His {{performances}} ended up helping him go from {{the possibility of being}} undrafted to being taken as early as the late first round. He was one of 60 players invited to the NBA Draft Combine. On June 27, 2013, Rice was selected with the 35th overall pick of the NBA Draft by the Philadelphia 76ers, but was traded to the Washington Wizards for the 38th and 54th selections, {{which turned out to be}} Nate Wolters and Arsalan Kazemi, respectively. He became the fourth player with D-League experience to be drafted and at 35th overall was the highest D-League veteran to have been drafted to that point. However, P. J. Hairston became the first D-League first-rounder when he was drafted 26th in the 2014 NBA draft to eclipse this record.|$|E
5|$|As {{the season}} concluded, the obvious {{standout}} <b>draft</b> <b>choice</b> for both leagues was Alabama quarterback Joe Namath. The Houston Oilers, {{in last place}} in the AFL East, had the number-one pick for the AFL. Both the Oilers and Jets realized that the Jets had a far better chance of signing Namath in competition with the NFL team which drafted him (as it turned out, the St. Louis Cardinals, formerly the Chicago Cardinals), and the Jets were able to acquire the number-one pick. Neither the Jets nor the Cardinals could sign Namath until Alabama played its {{final game of the}} season, the Orange Bowl, on January 1, 1965. Both the Jets and Cardinals negotiated with Namath's attorney, and when the price got too high for the Cardinals, the Giants secretly acquired Namath's NFL rights. Longtime Jets coach Walt Michaels admitted many years later that the Jets had signed Namath days before the game. On January 2, 1965, the Jets held a press conference to announce Namath's signing.|$|E
