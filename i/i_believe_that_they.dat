2500|$|The {{feeling of}} the day about the {{slaughter}} among supporters of the Parliamentary cause is well brought out in a contemporary London newspaper. [...] "The enemy, for aught I can learn, desired no quarter, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had but little offered them. You must remember what they were: they were most of them Papists; therefore our muskets and our swords did show but little compassion, and this house being at length subdued, did satisfy for her treason and rebellion by {{the blood of the}} offenders".|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, Arno Press {{released}} a nine-volume compilation of The Ladder in hardback {{as part of}} their series [...] "Lesbians and Gay Men in Society, History, and Literature" [...] with a short foreword by Barbara Grier. Speaking to journalist and historian Rodger Streitmatter about The Ladder, Grier commented that [...] "no woman ever made a dime for her work, and some ... worked themselves into a state of mental and physical decline on behalf of the magazine." [...] She felt that [...] "most of [...] (the editors) believed that they were moving the world with their labors, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were right".|$|E
2500|$|Annan {{initially}} {{refused to}} delay the mission. Expressing Israeli sentiment that the world ignored its victims, Ben-Eliezer said: [...] "In the last month alone, 137 people were slaughtered by Palestinians and nearly 700 wounded. Is there any one who is investigating that?" [...] Saeb Erekat accused Israel of [...] "trying to sabotage the mission. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have a big thing to hide." [...] On April 25, the UN agreed to postpone {{the arrival of the}} team by two days, and acceded to an Israeli request that two military officers be added to the team. Annan said talks with Israel had been, [...] "very, very constructive and I'm sure we'll be able to sort out our differences". Peres said that a delay would give the Israeli cabinet the opportunity to discuss the mission before the team arrived.|$|E
5000|$|During the MPs {{expenses}} scandal newspapers {{reported on}} Hoban's £12,000 furniture bill including £35 on a toilet-roll holder, £10 on a chrome shower rack and £79 on four silk cushions on his second-home allowance. Hoban said, [...] "At the time I made these claims <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were reasonable {{and within the}} spirit of the rules." ...|$|R

2500|$|There is a {{fish that}} is still unmentioned, which it is {{scarcely}} advisable to speak about on account of its size, because it will seem to most people incredible. There are only a very few who can speak upon it clearly, because it is seldom near land nor appears where it may be seen by fishermen, and I suppose {{there are not many}} of this sort of fish in the sea. Most often in our tongue we call it hafgufa ("kraken" [...] in e.g. Laurence M. Larson's translation). Nor can I conclusively speak about its length in ells, because the times he has shown before men, he has appeared more like land than like a fish. Neither have I heard that one had been caught or found dead; {{and it seems to me}} as though there must be no more than two in the oceans, and I deem that each is unable to reproduce itself, for <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are always the same ones. Then too, neither would it do for other fish if the hafgufa were of such a number as other whales, on account of their vastness, and how much subsistence that they need. It is said to be the nature of these fish that when one shall desire to eat, then it stretches up its neck with a great belching, and following this belching comes forth much food, so that all kinds of fish that are near to hand will come to present location, then will gather together, both small and large, believing they shall obtain their food and good eating; but this great fish lets its mouth stand open the while, and the gap is no less wide than that of a great sound or bight, And nor the fish avoid running together there in their great numbers. But as soon as its stomach and mouth is full, then it locks together its jaws and has the fish all caught and enclosed, that before greedily came there looking for food.|$|E

60|$|The {{worst of}} the storm was done, but for a while the {{darkness}} was so dense {{that we could not}} move, nor, indeed, was I inclined to leave the safety of the hillside where the lightning was never known to strike, and venture down to the iron-stone.

Examples of [...] "reformed characters" [...] were frequently pointed out to me--indeed, our village, situate {{a few miles from}} a small seaport town, seemed to be peculiarly rich in such. They were, from all accounts, including their own, persons who had formerly behaved with quite unnecessary depravity, and who, at the time I knew them, appeared to be going to equally objectionable lengths in the opposite direction. They invariably belonged to one of two classes, the low-spirited or the aggressively unpleasant. <b>They</b> said, and <b>I</b> <b>believed,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were happy; but I could not help reflecting how very sad they must have been before they were happy.|$|R
