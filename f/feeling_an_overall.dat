40|$|It {{has been}} my {{experience}} that parents are willing and open to express their voices to promote and advocate for music therapy services for their terminally ill children. By listening to parents' voices when providing care for terminally ill children, much {{can be done to}} ease the suffering of children and families {{at the end of life}} (Widger & Wilkins, 2004). My music therapy masters research at the University of Melbourne with Dr. Katrina McFerran will investigate bereaved parents' experiences of music therapy with their terminally ill child. This inquiry unfolded through my music therapy work with several children and families within hospice and palliative care. Parents have reflected that music therapy was a vital component in their child's care at the end of life. As one mom commented, "I don't care what anyone says, it has made a world of a difference. " In order to further explore parents' experiences of music therapy, in-depth interviews will be conducted and transcripts will be analyzed using phenomenological strategies. It has been reported that parents find the interview process helpful in working through grief. They have also reported <b>feeling</b> <b>an</b> <b>overall</b> eagerness to share their child's story in order to provide input that might assist other families in the future (Widger & Wilkins, 2004). This article will describe pediatric palliative and hospice care, discuss parents as advocates for their terminally ill children, portray the use of music therapy within pediatrics, and share an example of music therapy with Jack...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to understand the role of the family on the sexual experiences of adolescents from urban, disadvantaged settings in Baltimore and Johannesburg. Data were collected as part of the WAVE study, a global study of disadvantaged youth in five cities. Qualitative data were based on key informant interviews, a Photovoice exercise, community mapping, focus groups and in-depth interviews with adolescents. Quantitative data were gathered from an ACASI survey that was administered to approximately 450 - 500 adolescents per site. Results from the qualitative data revealed that while parents were viewed as important sources of information for sexual and reproductive health, they were often not present in the adolescents' lives. This lack of parental presence was perceived to result in adolescents <b>feeling</b> <b>an</b> <b>overall</b> lack of adult support and guidance. The impact of parental presence and support on adolescent sexual experience was further examined from the quantitative data and revealed a complex picture. In both Baltimore and Johannesburg, female adolescents who were raised by other relatives were less likely to report having had sex compared to those raised by two biological parents, which was not observed for males. In Johannesburg, female adolescents who were paternal orphans were less likely to have had sex compared to non-orphans; the opposite was true among males. Finally, in both sites, female adolescents who had been exposed to violence were more likely to have had sex compared to those who had not; for males, there was no significant relationship. The study demonstrates the powerful influence of both context and gender for understanding the influences of the family on adolescent sexual behaviors. Programs aiming to reduce adolescent sexual risk behaviors the need to understand the complex influences on risk behaviors in different settings and in particular, the role of mothers and fathers. Prevention strategies need to also understand and incorporate gender-specific messages and interventions in order to address the high risk of sexual behaviors among adolescents in these settings...|$|E
40|$|Eighty-six patients, {{each with}} {{hemiparesis}} {{caused by a}} single stroke, were studied to assess the changes in sexual life experienced after {{the onset of the}} illness. Clinical data were collected, and a questionnaire concerning both sexual behavior and feelings about sexuality was administered to the patients and their spouses. Twenty-four couples were eliminated from further analysis because of a discrepancy between husband and wife in the answers concerning sexual behavior after stroke. A marked decline in sexual activity after stroke was found in both genders; other aspects of sexual behavior underwent fewer changes. The felling of <b>an</b> <b>overall</b> change in sexual life was reported more frequently by male patients. Most patients' spouses reported the <b>feeling</b> of <b>an</b> <b>overall</b> psychological change in their partners and the <b>feeling</b> of <b>an</b> <b>overall</b> change in sexual life after the onset of the illness. No significant associations were found between clinical features and changes in sexual life. This study confirms that cerebrovascular accidents are generally followed by some important alterations in sexual life. Clinical factors do not seem to {{play a crucial role in}} determining these changes, which may be better explained in terms of maladjustment attributable to psychologic and interpersonal factors...|$|R

The lines are clearer and depths more definable. The upper tier is farthest away from the congregation, reaching toward heaven. The clarity adds to its sense of order and peace. It is farther for the congregation to reach. There is no direct link between this heaven for the congregation except through Petronilla who has passed from the earth and is greeted by the Christ.|$|R
