40|$|A novel {{approach}} for computer color matching is proposed. In {{contrast to the}} existing computer color matching processes, this approach does not need the database of colorants with their absorption and scattering coefficients in order to predict the <b>dyeing</b> <b>recipe</b> and correct it.

The basic aim has been to predict recipe for reproducing desired color by using only three primary subtractive colors: Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow, {{then be able to}} correct it dynamically for a reproduction close to the target.

40|$|The dyeing of {{polyester}} with {{disperse dyes}} has been practiced {{for the last}} 60 years. Nevertheless, the <b>dyeing</b> <b>recipe</b> is typically decided by experience based on dye house experts’ judgment. This study aims to provide a fundamental understanding of the overall polyester dyeing process, from dye uptake by fibre in a microscopic view, via analysis of the coloration of dyed product, to the operational optimization of the actual process. Through such an understanding, a better process for obtaining {{a product of the}} desired quality can be developed. For this, bench scale dyeing experiments were carried out in a specially designed dyeing tank and dye uptake by the fibre was monitored by dye solution sampling. The dye uptake rate was related to the structure and properties of polyester. Plasticizing effect of one common carrier and solubilizing effect of surfactants were investigated individually. These effects on the dye uptake rate were related to the color evenness and the color of the final product based on the analysis on the final coloration in the CIE L*a*b* Colorspace. Similar monitoring system on dyeing cotton with reactive dyes was also carried out, showing the capability of the experimental setup for various situations. With the understanding on the impact of various effects {{on the quality of the}} dyed product, several schemes for process improvement have been proposed. For polyester dyeing, the duration at the highest temperature is reduced by 12 minutes, which is significant in energy saving. For cotton dyeing, the overall dye uptake is increased from 60 % to 63 %. The washing efficient is also improved, which helps saving one sixth of liquor in the washing process. These promising results prove that the experimental setup is capable of enhancing the dyeing process in a systemic way...|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) {{printing}} {{refers to}} a group of digitally controlled, additive manufacturing technologies increasingly used to fabricate customised objects from a range of possible materials, including food ingredients, using a digital image file representing the object. A novel variation on 3 D food printing is being developed to customise the appearance of foods with an embedded 3 D colour image by the selective blending of primary colorants. This capability is beyond what is needed usually for the coloration of bulk, single food matrices. In this thesis, non-food techniques of colorimetric matching (used in computer match prediction) and colour gamut mapping (from cross-media colour reproduction), were investigated as potential methods for <b>dye</b> <b>recipe</b> computation by the new 3 D colour food printer. The aim was to develop a model for transforming image RGB data to <b>dye</b> <b>recipe</b> data, taking into account the variable effects of food properties. The two techniques were applied to the problem of matching a set of standard tile colours using a set of primary colorants in model food substrates. Kubelka-Munk (K-M) blending equations underlying both techniques were developed for blends of Brilliant Blue, Ponceau 4 R (red) and Tartrazine (yellow) food dyes when added to a microwave-baked cake and to four variants of a wheat starch gel. Validation of the model for the cake blends was shown the by ΔE*ab, 10 differences between computed and measured L* 10 a* 10 b* 10 colours falling within range of a visually acceptable match (three ΔE*ab, 10 units). For some of the gel blends, the ΔE*ab, 10 differences reached five units. <b>Dye</b> <b>recipes</b> computed by a modified colorimetric matching algorithm to match target tile colours with cake colours at times called for negative quantities, or totals that exceeded the legal limits for foods containing dyes, indicating that the target colour was outside the range (gamut) of the cake-dye system. In these <b>recipes,</b> individual negative <b>dye</b> quantities were increased to zero, and totals scaled back to within the legal limit, retaining relative dye proportions. This resulted in close differences between tile and cake before scaling (with computed ΔE*ab, 10 values of less than three units for as many as eight of the twelve target colours) becoming much larger after scaling (up to 39 ΔE*ab, 10 units), though visual inspection of the colour pairs suggested that the matches might be closer. The gamut of perceived colours from a coloured food is not only constrained by legal restrictions on dye addition, but dependent on the properties of the food itself, such as its background colour (seldom white) and the light-scattering effects of surface texture. Compared with colour images, foods are likely to have a more limited colour gamut, the size of which is expected to vary with changes in formulation and processing. Gamut mapping techniques were used to investigate {{the extent to which the}} target tile colours themselves needed to be scaled back before matching solutions and corresponding <b>dye</b> <b>recipes</b> could be computed. Using four samples of the gel that differed only in their level of (artificial) browning, including white, the impact of browning on the colour gamut was determined. Using the cake, solutions from gamut mapping were compared with those from colorimetric matching. A gamut of discrete colours is treated as a continuous volume in colour space. In the absence of a published gamut calculation for coloured foods, a technique was developed to compute a mesh of points on the colour gamut boundary. Boundary colours were computed using dye blends not exceeding the legal limit, and spaced such that ΔE*ab, 10 did not exceed three units. This method was applied to the white (non-textured) gel containing dye blends, to generate a ‘base’ gamut. The absorption behaviour of each dye was found to be largely consistent among the white and browned gels which enabled quick computation of colour gamuts for the brown gels by substituting the absorption spectrum of a brown gel for that of the white in the K-M equation. The colour gamut was found to decrease in size and to shift position with increased gel browning. The dye blends that were used to compute the colour gamut boundary for the whitened gel were combined with the absorption spectrum for the cake to compute the gamut boundary for the cake colours. All colour gamuts were specific to the standard D 65 illuminant and 10 degree standard observer. In the investigation of the effects of browning, colour gamut mapping began with the initial replacement of each tile colour with a colour from the white gel gamut. All colours were replaced gradually by a darker, and often less chromatic, colour, as the level of browning in the gel was increased. As a result of the reduction in gamut size with increased gel browning, the difference between tile colours and their replacement targets in each of the reduced gamuts was smaller for tile colours having ‘brown’ characteristics (such as Orange, Red and Yellow) than they were for blue-, pink- and green- coloured tiles. Larger increases in total dye quantity with increased gel browning were needed for the latter group of colours than for the former. For most colours an increase in the relative proportion of the darkest <b>dye</b> in the <b>recipe</b> was also needed. The actual dye quantities computed for each replacement colour depended on the availability of mesh points in the region of colour space in which the tile was located. Colour gamut mapping required a heavier computational load than the colorimetric matching technique to provide solutions for tile colours in the cake-dye gamut. Although not always giving solutions in the same angular region of colour space as the tile colours, colorimetric matching was able to produce similar ΔE*ab, 10 differences between tile colour and best cake match as did colour gamut mapping, for not necessarily more or less total dye. Two forms of a generalised algorithm are proposed for the computation of <b>dye</b> <b>recipes</b> by the 3 D colour food printer. One algorithm is modelled on a workflow for cross-media colour reproduction. A series of transformations that account progressively for the effect of individual characteristics of the food printing substrate on the achievable gamut from dye blends is incorporated into the main series of transformations that transcribes RGB image data to <b>dye</b> <b>recipe</b> data. In the other algorithm, modelled on colorimetric matching, it is the progressive effect of each individual characteristic on the light-absorption characteristics of the un-dyed food printing substrate that is accounted for, and incorporated into the main matching workflow...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the project}} was the {{development}} and testing of techniques for the elimination/minimization of the two most critical pollutants of the textile industry: Dyestuffs and sizing agents. The project was carried out in cooperation with 7 German and 7 Brazilian companies. The techniques, used for the elimination/degradation of dyestuffs, were: precipitation/flocculation/flotation, aerobic reactor, aerobic/anaerobic reactor, nanofiltration, chemical oxidation. They were tested in combination with representatives of 11 different types of dyestuff. The techniques realized a reduction of color of 90 % to 99, 9 %, of COD by > 80 % and of Nitrogen of > 90 %. The residual color is below the German DFZ-standards (Anhang 38). The reuse of the purified wastewater is possible, e. g. for rinsing or for the preparation of <b>dye</b> <b>recipes.</b> Limits are due to the salt content, which can be reduced further by reverse osmosis. Economy studies revealed under consideration of the expenses for water (2 R$/m" 3) and thermal energy a return on investment of around 2 years. The recovery of sizing agent was carried {{out for the first time}} in combination with starch based size formulations. This requires carboxymethylized types of starches (CMS), which were manufactured by two Brazilian suppliers on basis of Mandioca and corn. The exclusion of biological degradation requires certain measures during desizing and the storage of the desize liquor and of the regenerate. The recovery tests were carried out with CMS/PVA blends 80 / 20 within 6 cycles and with pure CMS within 10 sycles. The warps, sized with the regenerate, ran equally well as the ones, sized with the standard size formulation. The ROI for an UF-plant is between 0. 8 and 2. 0 years. (orig.)

40|$|The {{excellence}} in quality of Biella wool fabric, provided {{from the last}} 40 years one of first position in {{all over the world}} for the "Biella textile district". In the last decade competition of developing countries became ruthless regarding the common textile like wool for a lot of reason, first of all cheaper labor. Industries started to move production over there but, fortunately, the know-how has remained here. For these reasons, since the past 10 years the world of textile, especially in Europe and USA, is moving to another kind of textile and garments dimension: the Technical Textile. Aramids are, since 90 's, the most important technical textile for protection garments, and in Biella district a lot of factories started to handle them. Since some factories started to produce yarn and fabric for protective garments, the need to dye them has come. The market nowadays requires, even for protective goods, not only the conventional coloration with which the fiber is produced in large scale by manufacturers, but all the typical color ranges of other common textile fibers. Nomex® fiber is probably the most important m-aramid used for this scope and its <b>dyeing</b> <b>recipes</b> are well known. However, Nomex® is not easily available for factories due to particular commercial agreements, and is very expensive. Other branded m-aramid fibers exist on the market having same technical properties of Nomex® but, unfortunately, not exactly the same dyeability.

40|$|A legal {{ideology}} {{emerged in}} the 1870 s that celebrated contract as the body of law with the particular purpose of facilitating the formation of productive exchanges that would enrich {{the parties to the}} contract and, therefore, society as a whole. Across the spectrum of intellectual property, courts used the legal fiction of implied contract, and a version of it particularly emphasizing liberty of contract, to shift control of workplace knowledge from skilled employees to firms while suggesting that the emergence of hierarchical control and loss of entrepreneurial opportunity for creative workers was consistent with the free labor ideology that dominated American thinking on the subject of work. Based on original archival research, this paper explores the stories behind two influential court decisions about employee inventions in the 1890 s. In one, a court held that <b>dye</b> <b>recipes</b> were trade secrets owned by a Philadelphia textile mill rather than the human capital of skilled dyers. In the other, a court upheld a contract assigning future patents to the Duke tobacco companies of North Carolina. The paper examines the disjuncture between the rhetoric and doctrine of the court decisions, which assimilated notions of employee dependence and loyalty with the new laissez faire contract, and the norms of the business world in which creative workers operated. It tells the neglected story of how new legal rules transformed entrepreneurship and what that meant for creative workers. These cases, and others like them, rejected the nineteenth century notion that skilled workers and inventive employees were to use their knowledge and ingenuity entrepreneurially. Henceforward, employee knowledge and creativity were deemed to be transferred by an employment contract from employee to firm. The transformation of the employment contract dramatically changed the nature of entrepreneurship by employees, making it much more difficult for inventors to parlay their technical knowledge and business acumen into a successful firm as had been the model of business development to that point. Independent inventors who negotiated carefully for control of their intellectual property rights could remain entrepreneurial. Others would have to pin their hopes on the fortunes of their corporate employers...|$|R

There is now increasing interest and research in historical Chinese costume and textiles to identify their dye sources. Through our research, we aim to improve understanding of the use of dyes in a wider context by studying further the practical regulations of dyeing and the influence of social factors. This research also aims to establish a methodology for the chemical identification analysis of historical Chinese dyes by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) with different detection methods. The historical and archaeological dyes for our research are being collected from museums and archaeological institutes in both China and the UK. So far, 56 samples of various colour shades have been collected from 23 provenanced costumes and textiles belonging to the imperial family and officials of different ranks. Based on historical Chinese dyeing treatises from the 14 th to 19 th centuries, twelve common Chinese dyes and two mordants of historical significance have been selected and used to dye silk in the laboratory for analytical references. Initial chemical analysis was carried out by UPLC with Photo Diode Array detection (UPLC-PDA) and UPLCPDA-mass spectrometry. A database of the chemical composition of reference dyes has been created. The change of their chemical composition during ageing was being studied. Historical samples are being analysed by UPLC-PDA in a semi-quantitative study of the dye sources. This enables relationships between different dyes and practical regulations for their use in the historical costumes and textiles to be studied, such as difference and communalities between the dyes used for yarns for patterns, and those used for fabrics for grounds and linings. The change in use of dyes over time and geographical areas will be discussed.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how the knowledge about natural dyes survived the introduction of aniline dyes to Norway {{in the last quarter}} of the nineteenth-century. How this happened involved women, for there was a great campaign to keep the traditional colors alive for the continued use in woven cloth, coverlets, tapestries and folk costumes. At the beginning of the nineteenth century great efforts were made by women to restore and re-design traditional folk costumes; they were therefore in a position to keep the dye knowledge in the face of industrial competition. There was a country-wide search to gather <b>dye</b> <b>recipes</b> from people who lived in remote areas where traditional life remained unchanged well into the twentieth-century. The Norwegian folk costume is today enjoying a “renaissance”. Woollen skirts and jackets in different colors are richly embroidered with natural dyed silk or wool in a wide range of colors. Woven woollen ribbons in natural dyes are often used as belts or decoration. All of the color in a costume, which is worn with embroidered blouses or shirts and lavish silver jewelry, derives from the embroidery which varies in pattern and style from one region to another. At any big event in Norway, crowds in their folk costumes create a colourful display you can see from a great distance. What is very exciting is that the fashion industry has become aware of natural dyes as a trendsetting form of embellishment. A special effort has been made since the spring 2007 Oslo Fashion Week to promote awareness of dyes, and environmental and ethic issues. The Norwegian Home Arts and Crafts Association (Husfliden) has kept alive empirical knowledge about natural dyes by sponsoring workshops all over the country. I have also lived abroad and studied dyeing elsewhere. Those influences came back with me to Norway. My own work in natural dyes involves innovations in technique which can be seen in how I manipulate the dye and also the fabric. I describe this as “stunt dyeing”. So you can see that the traditions and the folk costumes have had an influence on me. I have also adapted my own work to reflect the woman I am, where I have lived and worked, and also to show how past and present come together for me in natural dyes...|$|R

They contain natural colouring matter which is generally non-allergic, non-toxic, non-carcinogenic and non-hazardous to the user and environment. Common drawbacks of natural dyes are their non-uniform shades and poor to moderate colourfastness. In this research project, solvent extracted dyes from alkanet (Alkana tinctoria), cutch (Acacia catechu), madder (Rubia tinctorum) and ready to use dyes from marigold flower (Tegetes erecta L) and Turkey red (Rubia cordifolia) have been applied on cotton fabric through pad-steam dyeing procedure. To evaluate the possibility of increasing their colour fastness, various dyeing auxiliaries (mordants, UV absorbers, cationizing agents, crosslinkers, etc.) have been applied by pre-treatment and post-treatment techniques. Metallic mordants included aluminium sulphate, copper sulphate, ferric chloride, potassium dichromate and hydrated potassium aluminium sulphate or alum. Better fastness (wash, light, crocking), colour coordinates (lightness, chroma, hue and colour strength) as well as improvement in tensile strength was achieved with postmordanting of copper sulphate on most of these dyes. Pre-mordanting of potassium dichromate brutally damaged the tensile strength of the alkanet dyed sample. Cationization of cotton with quaternary ammonium compound (Albafix WFF) has improved the fastness properties, tensile strength as well as relative colour strength (K/S) of cotton dyed with alkanet, cutch and marigold flower dyes. Post-padding of reactive UV absorber based on oxalanilide (UV-SUN) and UV absorber Rayosan C (heterocyclic compound) greatly increased the light fastness of cotton fabric, dyed with these dyes. Similarly, post-treatment of soft polyurethane emulsion (Dicrylan) has enhanced the light and wash fastness as well as retained the tensile strength of natural dyed cotton. The use of crosslinkers could not bring further enhancement in the K/S value of cotton dyed with alkanet and generally, they yielded lighter shade. Cutch root extract yielded variety of beautiful brown shades with different mordants. It made an excellent demonstration of the colour fastness and tensile strength of cotton. Improved fastness properties and tensile strength have resulted from the postpadding of crosslinkers i. e., Knittex (modified dihydroxyethylene urea) and Fixapret F ECO (modified dimethyloldihydroxyethylene urea) on cutch dyed cotton. Pre-treatments of most of the metallic mordants have decreased the tensile strength of Turkey red dyed cotton to a great extent. Madder was the least successful dye in terms of fastness and tensile properties. The post-padding of crosslinkers glyoxalmonourein (Fixapret CPF) on marigold flower dyed sample imparted good fastness properties in addition to improving the tensile strength of the fabric. However, the shade of sample was lighter (pale yellow) than the other dye formulations. Among the two types of treatments, post padding proved significantly better in most of the <b>dyeing</b> <b>recipes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Arraiolos {{tapestries}} {{are probably}} one of the richest artistic Portuguese expressions in terms of textile heritage. It is difficult to date the beginning of the production of rugs in Arraiolos, but they were already produced in the late 1600 ’s as they are listed in the inventories of Portuguese aristocratic households {{in the beginning of the}} 18 th century. This study is integrated in project “REMATAR- Rediscovering the Materials of Arraiolos Tapestries” (PTDC/HAH/ 64045 / 2006) which intends to obtain systematized information on the composition, structure and degradation processes of these tapestries, and to use this data to improve conservation methodologies. The gathered data on natural dyes and mordants used in tapestries dated from different periods will hopefully allow the establishment of a time scale of materials usage. The tapestries studied belong to the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga (MNAA) which the most complete and representative Arraiolos collection. Wool, linen and hemp were the most important fibres used in the making of Arraiolos tapestries. The richness of colours displayed by some of the Arraiolos tapestries denotes the likely use of a wide variety of dyes. However, only a few dye sources used worldwide to dye wool are described in the few bibliographic reports on Arraiolos making. Dye identification is usually done by extraction of the dyed fibre followed by high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (LC-DAD) and coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of the extract. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), techniques enable the comparison of the fibers length, thickness, cross section and surface analysis. SEM combined with energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX) can be used to give information on degradation processes and also on the mordants. Several procedures are available in the literature to extract dyes from wool and a study was performed to evaluate which is the most adequate for the different classes of natural dyes. Samples taken from a 17 th century rug (nr 88 from the MNAA collection, dimensions 294 x 168 cm) were extracted using optimized developed extraction procedures and analyzed by LC-DAD and LC-DAD-MS in order to identify the natural dyes. Microanalysis by SEM-EDX and μ-PIXE was done to identify the fibres used and assess their degradation; mordant analysis was done by 2 D elemental mapping. The results on the historic samples show that hemp and linnen were used for the support (warp threads) and wool for the weaving. Weld (for the yellows and greens), indigo (for the blues and greens) and cochineal (for the reads) were used to dye the wool fibres. Cochineal dye was never referred by Rivara in his reference <b>dye</b> <b>recipe</b> book probably because it describes the Arraiolos manufacture in later periods, when tapestries had lost richness of patterns and colours. In general, the wool fibres display the typical scale structure of wool with no obvious disruptions of morphology. However, in some cases, the wool fibres present roughened surfaces with loss of scale structure, transversal cracking and longitudinal splitting which is indicative of wear and biological degradation. With exception to blue dyed fibres, EDX analysis showed the presence of aluminium (and, in some cases, other metallic minor elements) evenly distributed over the fibres which is consistent to the use of alum as mordant...|$|R
