Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy and managed by the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is focused on developing technologies to capture, separate, and store CO 2 {{in order to reduce}} greenhouse gas emissions without adversely affecting energy use or hindering economic growth. NETL envisions having a technology portfolio of safe, cost-effective, greenhouse gas capture, transport, and storage technologies that will be available for commercial deployment. The Carbon Storage Program involves three key technology development elements: (1) Core Research and Development (R&D), (2) Infrastructure, and (3) Global Collaborations. The integration of these elements is addressing technological and marketplace challenges. The <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>element</b> of DOE's Carbon Storage Program is focused on R&D initiatives to advance geologic CO 2 storage commercialization. The <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>element</b> highlights DOE's awareness of the importance of addressing CO 2 mitigation on a regional level to most effectively manage differences in geology, climate, population density, infrastructure, and socioeconomic development. This element includes a series of geologic CO 2 storage field tests through the Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (RCSP) Initiative, as well as small-scale geologic CO 2 storage field testing efforts used to augment and build on the RCSP field test accomplishments. The <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>element</b> also includes crosscutting projects funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) that complement the existing Carbon Storage Program's efforts to develop carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) infrastructure in the United States. These ARRA-supported efforts include the establishment of seven CCUS training centers and nine geologic site characterization projects throughout the United States. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage and other clean coal technologies can {{play a critical role in}} mitigating CO 2 emissions while supporting U. S. energy security. DOE's Carbon Storage Program has positioned the United States on a path toward ensuring that these enabling technologies will be available to effect broad CCUS deployment. NETL is helping to promote widespread CCUS deployment through the Carbon Storage Program's <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>element,</b> which to date has: (1) safely and efficiently injected and stored close to more than three million metric tons of CO 2 across nearly 22 active or completed field projects; (2) generated lessons learned from those field projects and documented them in best-practices manuals; (3) refined national CO 2 storage assessments through characterization field projects; and (4) trained nearly 3, 000 students through the Regional Carbon Sequestration Training Centers. Even though NETL's Carbon Storage R&D Program is {{being implemented}} through several different initiatives, it should be viewed as an integrated whole, with many of the goals and objectives transitioning from one initiative to the next...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{bachelor}} thesis is to assess the conservation status of the critical <b>infrastructure</b> <b>element,</b> in this case medical operations centre of the Emergency Medical Service of the Pilsner region. Firstly, the work deals with situations of the imminent danger of the building {{on the basis of}} emergency or crisis situations, which are based on the risk analysis. This risk analysis {{is a part of the}} Emergency Plan of the Pilsen Region, which has been prepared by the Fire Brigade of the Pilsner region. On the basis of local investigations there are evaluated some current measures in the context of already existing documents, namely the processed crises preparedness plan. These most probable "classic risks" are then further elaborated including evacuation as a typical measure for some of them. In the next section this Bachelor thesis has focused on the "new threats", mainly on a violation of a cyber security, with an assessment of the current state of backup systems and their own security, storage and the backup of the electronic data. Analyzing the current hardware and software of the operating medical centres and related infrastructure network, there are identified configurations of some individual elements, their relationships and especially their security. Some remedial measures are suggested in case of the unsatisfactory situation. The benefit of this work is the inclusion of results of the investigation related to cyber security in the current crisis preparedness plan, which has not included this issue yet. The results and conclusions of this bachelor thesis are therefore used to improve crisis preparedness of Emergency Medical Services of Pilsen region in terms of the protection of the critical <b>infrastructure</b> <b>element...</b>|$|E

More precisely, we detect and analyze cyber-threat infrastructures {{for the purpose of}} unveiling key players (owners, domains, IPs, organizations, malware families, etc.) and the relationships between these players. To this end, we propose metrics to measure the badness of different <b>infrastructure</b> <b>elements</b> using graph theoretic concepts such as centrality concepts and Google PageRank. In addition, we quantify the sharing of <b>infrastructure</b> <b>elements</b> among different malware samples and families to unveil potential groups that are behind specific attacks. Moreover, we study the evolution of cyber-threat infrastructures over time to infer patterns of cyber-criminal activities.

40|$|As {{electronic}} voting enters {{the stage of}} real-world implementations, digital signature cards emerge as a basic <b>infrastructure</b> <b>element</b> for e-voting. The paper focuses on three main functions of such cards: (i) Authentication and (as National ID Card also) identification, (ii) as a storage media and (iii) as a secure processing environment. These properties enable protocols for secure e-voting, which guarantees the General Voting Principles. However, the diffusion of digital signature cards is still relatively low and in many cases, electronic vote casting has to be implemented without such cards. The paper reports on a test election conducted in Austria in May 2003 using a protocol designed for digital signature cards, which was adapted to a case, where such cards are not (yet) available. The necessary adaptations clearly show the importance of digital signature cards for secure e-voting...|$|E
