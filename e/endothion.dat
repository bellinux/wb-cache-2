Eight ounces of 50 % emulsifiable concentration of M. G. K. repellent 874 was mixed into the Rogor solution and applied with it to the 2 acres of crop. Both crops were sprayed before bees from nearby apiaries commenced to visit them. Bees collected nectar and pollen extensively from the crops which were of maximum attractiveness. No repellency was exhibited by the Rogor-M. G. K. repellent 874 mixture or by the <b>Endothion.</b> Rogor proved highly toxic to field bees, althought brood was not affected.
