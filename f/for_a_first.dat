5|$|After {{receiving}} the post-field goal kickoff, the Florida State offense began another drive. After an incomplete pass {{and a short}} rush, Weatherford completed a 12-yard pass <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> down as time expired in the quarter. After 15minutes of play, the score was tied 33, but Drew Weatherford had begun driving Florida State offense down the field.|$|E
5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Tennessee {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Tech's kickoff was returned to the Tennessee 13-yard line, and Peyton Manning returned to the field to lead the Volunteers' offense. The first play {{of the second half}} was an eight-yard run by James Stewart, which was followed by a six-yard run by Stewart <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> down at the Tennessee 27-yard line. Another Stewart run was followed by two short completions from Manning, and the Volunteers had another first down at the 37-yard line. Tennessee's next play was negated by an offensive pass interference penalty against the Volunteers, who were pushed back to the 22-yard line by the penalty. Though Manning gained 22 yards with a third-down pass, Tennessee was unable to gain enough yards <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> down and punted. During the kick, Tennessee committed a penalty and had to kick again after the five-yard penalty was assessed. The punt was fair caught at the Tech 25-yard line, and the Hokies began their first offensive possession of the second half with 10:14 remaining in the third quarter.|$|E
5|$|Before Glöckner's 2003 {{article on}} the origin of the Magnificat, and for some authors still after that, it was {{generally}} assumed that Bach had composed his Magnificat in the quiet time of Advent 1723 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> performance at the Christmas vespers. For that performance Bach composed four laudes, songs of praise partly in German, partly in Latin to be inserted at certain points in the E-flat major version of the Magnificat. The E-flat major version of the Magnificat including these interpolations is known as BWV 243a.|$|E

5|$|Bryan Still fielded the Tennessee kickoff and {{returned}} it to the 19-yard line of Virginia Tech. After a short pass, DeShazo threw his second interception of the game. Tennessee defender John Summers returned the catch to the Tech 19-yard line, and backup quarterback Branndon Stewart returned to the game for Tennessee's offense. James Stewart took the first play of the Volunteers' drive, an eight-yard gain, then backup Jay Graham entered the game {{and ran to the}} five-yard line <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> down. After the next play—, a two-yard run by Graham—Tennessee committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty, pushing the Volunteers back to the 17-yard line. Branndon Stewart completed a pass to tight end David Horn, pushing Tennessee back to the three-yard line, but not gaining enough <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> down. Tennessee kicker John Becksvoort returned to the game, and his 19-yard field goal attempt was good, giving the Volunteers a 4516 lead with 9:41 to go in the game.|$|E

5|$|Florida State's kickoff was fielded {{inside the}} Virginia Tech five-yard line and {{returned}} to the Tech eight-yard line. Tech gained five yards on two running plays, then Noel completed a 15-yard pass to Davis <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> down at the Tech 28-yard line. Noel and Jones each carried the ball, together gaining enough <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> down at the Tech 39-yard line. A completed pass and a short run by Jones resulted in another first down, this time at the 50-yard line. Florida State committed a five-yard offsides penalty, but the Hokies were unable to gain a first down on the Seminoles' side of the field. Rather than attempt to convert another fourth down, the Hokies punted the ball.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's post-score kickoff {{sailed through}} the end zone for a touchback, and Tech's offense began its first drive of the quarter from its 20-yard line. Tech's first play of the quarter was a 15-yard {{completed}} pass by Noel <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> down. That was followed by an 11-yard run by Jones for another first down. After an incomplete pass, Noel ran <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> down at the State 41-yard line. Inside Florida State territory, gaining ground became much more difficult. The next three plays netted Tech only nine yards, setting up a critical fourth-and-one play. With Virginia Tech outside field goal range and trailing, the Hokies needed another first down to move within potential scoring range. But on fourth down, Jones was stopped for no gain on a running play, and the Hokies turned the ball over on downs. The play later was cited as the game's turning point.|$|E
5|$|Following the turnover, Clemson {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 28-yard line. Simmons ran the ball straight ahead for an eight-yard gain, gained one yard on a run, then Kelly ran <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> down at the 40-yard line. On first down, Simmons completed an 18-yard pass to Gardner at the Tech 42-yard line. Simmons then completed a six-yard pass before throwing a shovel pass to Kelly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> down at the Tech 32-yard line. An incomplete pass was followed by six-yard toss and a pass to Watts at the 12-yard line. Simmons ran out of bounds for a two-yard loss, then completed a touchdown pass to Gardner. The extra point kick was good, and Clemson closed Virginia Tech's lead to 3420 with 7:19 remaining.|$|E

Following the play, the Volunteers completed a penalty, advancing {{the ball to the}} Tennessee 22-yard line. Two short runs advanced the Hokies to the 19-yard line, then Druckenmiller completed a 10-yard pass to Freeman <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> down. On the next play, Druckenmiller connected with Still for a nine-yard touchdown pass. The extra point was good, and Tennessee's lead was cut to 4523, but with only 4:13 remaining in the game, the game seemed out of reach for the Hokies.|$|E

5|$|Nebraska {{began its}} {{possession}} at its five-yard line after the returner was tackled for a three-yard loss and the Cornhuskers were assessed six yards of penalties during the return. Frost threw an incomplete pass, Schuster ran for four yards, then Frost completed a 14-yard pass to Shevin Wiggins <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> {{down at the}} Nebraska 23-yard line. Frost continued the drive by earning nine yards on an option, then Schuster picked up three yards for another first down. Sims followed this by gaining 22 yards and two first downs on the next three plays. Frost then completed a 17-yard throw to Jeff Lake <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> down at Tech's 26-yard line. Just outside Tech's red zone, however, the drive petered out. Sims was stopped for a short loss, Frost ran for eight yards, and threw an incomplete pass, causing a fourth down. Kris Brown kicked his second field goal of the game, this time a 37-yard kick, which was successful. With 7:52 remaining in the game, Nebraska had a 3421 lead.|$|E

5|$|Tech {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 16-yard line, and Casey completed a quick 14-yard pass to Purdham <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> down. But Tech was unable to gain another first down, and after four plays were stopped short, Tech turned the ball over to Miami after Casey threw an incomplete pass on fourth down. Miami {{received the}} ball with 1:24 remaining and ran a series of inconsequential plays to draw down the clock and bring the game to an end. Miami earned the win, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Tech's drive {{began with}} a {{completed}} pass for no gain to Evans. This {{was followed by a}} five-yard run by Evans and a 23-yard pass from Taylor to tight end Greg Boone <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> down at the Tech 48-yard line. Taylor then completed a nine-yard pass to Boone. After two plays were stopped for no gain, Taylor ran two yards <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> down, keeping the drive alive. With time running out in the first half, Taylor completed a nine-yard pass to Boone, then ran six yards <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> down at the Cincinnati 26-yard line. The Hokies then called another timeout to stop the clock with three seconds remaining in the quarter. Tech kicker Dustin Keys returned to the game, and as time expired in the first half, he kicked a 43-yard field goal that gave the Hokies a 10–7 lead.|$|E
5|$|Texas' post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech four-yard line. A two-yard run was followed by an 11-yard carry by Ken Oxendine who earned a first down at the Tech 17-yard line.

Texas committed a five-yard offsides penalty, then a long pass downfield fell incomplete. Two more plays failed to gain a first down, and the Hokies punted.|$|E
