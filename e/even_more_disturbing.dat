25|$|Latour, {{moving along}} muddy forest trails amid snow and sleet squalls, fell badly behind schedule. At 10:00am, his column was still {{well to the}} rear of Kollowrat's corps. By this time, the gunfire from Kienmayer's and Kollowrat's combats could be clearly heard to the front. <b>Even</b> <b>more</b> <b>disturbing</b> were sounds of battle from the south. Latour made the {{extraordinary}} decision to divide the divisions of Feldmarschall-Leutnants Prince Friedrich of Hessen-Homburg and Friedrich Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen into small task forces. He sent one infantry battalion and six cavalry squadrons to the north to look for Kienmayer. One battalion and four squadrons marched south to find Kollowrat. After advancing the bulk of his column to the village of Mittbach, Latour sent two battalions and two squadrons to assist Schwarzenberg's attack and three battalions and an artillery battery to help Kollowrat. This left him with only three battalions and six squadrons.|$|E

The Hollywood Reporter Frank Scheck described the film as [...] "one of the most audacious, iconoclastic horror films in recent years". Mark Schilling (The Japan Times) praised Shiina and Ishibashi's acting, but noted that [...] "among the film's few irritants is a smarmy, snarly bad guy turn by Renji Ishibashi as Asami's wheelchair-bound ballet instructor. He {{is a reminder of}} where too many other Miike films have headed – straight for the video racks".

The physician {{must recognize that}} the premenstruum—the {{four days before the}} onset of the menses—is a `high risk' phase for women. They may demonstrate somatic and psychological complaints such as irritability, aggression, tension, anxiety, depression, lethargy, insomnia, poor coordination and concentration. Psychological disturbances can range from self-deprecation and the feeling that `everything is too much' to pronounced feelings of oppression and depression. Psychiatric patients may become <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>disturbed</b> at this time. Recent reviews on PMS have studied its etiology and its possible connection to hormone imbalance, but to date there is no complete explanation for the syndrome's psychological symptoms. The most promising treatments for the psychological symptoms of PMS are pyridoxine (although there are conflicting reports about it), antidepressants, benzodiazepines if anxiety and tension dominate, and ongoing psychotherapy for severe cases...|$|R

After his death, the BUF government abolished the monarchy and placed the Royal Family under house arrest in Balmoral Castle until they were expatriated to Switzerland in September 1939.

40|$|AbstractIn {{photosynthetic}} organisms, carotenoids (carotenes and xanthophylls) {{are important}} for light harvesting, photoprotection and structural stability {{of a variety of}} pigment–protein complexes. Here, we investigated the consequences of altered carotenoid composition for the functional organization of photosynthetic complexes in wild-type and various mutant strains of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Although it is generally accepted that xanthophylls do not play a role in cyanobacterial photosynthesis in low-light conditions, we have found that the absence of xanthophylls leads to reduced oligomerization of photosystems I and II. This is remarkable because these complexes do not bind xanthophylls. Oligomerization is <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>disturbed</b> in crtH mutant cells, which show limited carotenoid synthesis; in these cells also the phycobilisomes are distorted despite the fact that these extramembranous light-harvesting complexes do not contain carotenoids. The number of phycocyanin rods connected to the phycobilisome core is strongly reduced leading to high amounts of unattached phycocyanin units. In the absence of carotenoids the overall organization of the thylakoid membranes is disturbed: Photosystem II is not formed, photosystem I hardly oligomerizes and the assembly of phycobilisomes remains incomplete. These data underline the importance of carotenoids in the structural and functional organization of the cyanobacterial photosynthetic machinery...|$|R

These disturbances are often sec-ondary to medical illness and/or medication use or are due to specific problems such as sleep dis-ordered breathing, periodic limb movements in sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances. The prevalence of sleep disordered breathing and periodic limb movement in sleep increases with age. The circadian rhythm tends to advance with age, causing older people to awaken early in the morning. Insomnia is often caused by pain associated with medical illness. Insomnia can also be caused by stimulating medications. In institutionalized elderly, sleep becomes <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>disturbed</b> and fragmented than in community-dwelling older adults.

Charlotte chastises Humbert for sending Lolita candy while she is away. He imagines not only standing up to Charlotte, but also killing her because he cannot bear the thought of being stuck with her; however, he realizes that he does not have the stomach to kill her, and that his dream of being rid of her will not be (“Farewell, Little Dream”). Charlotte admits that Lolita will not be coming home, and going right to boarding school. Humbert stands up to her, and she gives in. Charlotte finds Humbert’s journal, in which he has written about how much he loves Lolita, and hates Charlotte.

Sloan writes a biography of Victor entitled, [...] "Lord of The Banner", which implicates Dorian (Strasser, onward) in his death. Dorian is deeply offended by this and wages war on Sloan. Sloan plants seeds of intrigue in Viki's mind, and Viki goes to the Llanview police requesting they reopen the investigation on her father's death.
