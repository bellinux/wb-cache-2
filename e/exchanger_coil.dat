50|$|Air-source {{heat pumps}} are more popular in milder winter climates where the {{temperature}} is frequently {{in the range of}} 40-55 °F (4-13 °C), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil,</b> which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. A heat pump system will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} a water based thermal store {{for use in a}} {{domestic}} central heating system has been investigated theoretically, experimentally and numerically. The transient operation of the store during both the space heating and domestic hot-water modes of operation have been investigated separately. Heat transfer correlations in terms of Nusselt and Rayleigh numbers have been developed in order to predict the natural convection heat transfer coefficient for the outside surface of the horizontal axis finned tube heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil</b> located within the store. These heat-transfer correlations can predict the value of the heat transfer coefficient with an accuracy of better than 5 % and are in good agreement with existing heat transfer correlations developed for the same geometry of finned tubes and modes of heat transfer. The effect of the water flow rate in the heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil</b> on the internal heat transfer coefficient is also investigated. This flow rate should be above 4 litre/minute to achieve a high rate of heat-transfer from the wall of the heat exchanger to the water in the pipe. A detailed investigation of the use of horizontal and vertical baffles to increase the effectiveness of heat delivery in the domestic hot water mode has been carried out. Some improvements can be achieved by the use of a horizontal flat plate located {{in the middle of the}} store. This plate, when correctly sized enhances stratification and hence improves the effectiveness of heat recovery. Vertical plate arrangements and a rectangular duct situated around the upper heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil</b> were found to be ineffective. However, due to an increased velocity of the water around the heat exchanger, the external heat transfer coefficient of the heat exchanger was increased by 12 %. The comparison of experimental observations with computer simulations of the development of the thermocline in the store during the space heating mode of operation showed the presence of a jet in the bottom region of the store at the return inlet. The jet induces a significant amount of mixing in the store which reduces the effectiveness of heat recovery. Correlations in terms of Richardson number and effectiveness of heat delivery have been developed to characterize the effect of this jet. An inlet arrangement designed to achieve a Richardson number exceeding 3 significantly reduces the mixing created by the jet and can increase the amount of heat delivered in the space heating mode by approximately 5 %...|$|E
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} based on an industry-sponsor project {{involving}} a novel waste heat-to-electricity conversion system. This proprietary system utilizes thermal energy from a low temperature heat sources to produce torque that drives an electric generator to produce electricity. The system needs to be studied through scientific research to help with optimizing the product development, component design, and overall system performance. The main objectives of this study are to develop simulation tools (numerical model) that will allow to simulate the thermo-fluid processes in various system components and to use this numerical model to study the heat transfer and phase-change processes along with the work interactions. In {{the first part of this}} study, a novel numerical model was developed using the commercial CFD software Fluent. The novelty of this model was its capability to simultaneously simulate the phase-change and moving boundary processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such integrated model has been developed. The model coupled the Mixture model and the Dynamic Mesh model via developed user-defined functions. However, due to the limitations of the CFD software, the investigations were restricted to the fundamental heat transfer and phase-change processes in the lower vessel and the associated heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil</b> which undergoes the boiling process, along with the piston movement in the vessel. The heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil</b> is one of the key components of the system where the primary phase change process takes place and its design has a direct impact on the overall system performance. Thus, the main focus on the second part of this study was on a detailed investigation of the phase-change process in the heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil</b> and its design improvement as well as the type of the working fluid. The investigation of the working fluid involved four volatile substances: methanol, ethanol, pentane and butane. Due to the low boiling point and low latent heat pentane was recommended as the best substance among the four. Its low boiling point also allows the system to extract heat at lower waste heat temperatures. The study of the heat exchange and phase-change processes in the heat exchanger and the vessel involved a detailed investigation of these processes, which include the spatio-temporal variations of the flow patterns and the mixture quality. Various heat exchanger geometries and configurations were considered. A common feature observed in all these configurations was the presence of a cyclic process inside the heat exchanger tube where the low quality mixture (heavy fluid) near the bottom of the vessel enters from one end of the heat exchanger and the high quality mixture (light fluid) escapes in the form of jet into the vessel from the other end of the tube. It was found that the speed of the jet increased with an increase in the surface area of the heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil.</b> The impact of heat exchanger geometry and configuration on the flow patterns and the mixture quality as well as the piston movement is presented and discussed in detail. These results will be utilized by Dyverga to improve the heat exchanger design. The novel model developed in this study will serve as a valuable tool for Dyverga to further study various thermo-fluid processes in all other system components and for the system optimization...|$|E

A factor was included for analyzing systems operating at low (10 - 101. 3 kPa) pressure to reduce gas leakage and structural mass (e. g., inflatable greenhouses for space application). The expected close relationship between temperature and relative humidity was observed, along with the importance of heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil</b> temperature and air circulation rate. The presence of plants in closed habitats results in increased water flux through the system. Changes in pressure affect gas diffusion rates and surface boundary layers, and change convective transfer capabilities and water evaporation rates. A consistent observation from studies with plants at reduced pressures is increased evapotranspiration rates, even at constant vapor pressure deficits. This suggests that plant water status is a critical factor for managing low-pressure production systems. The approach suggested should help space mission planners design artificial environments in closed habitats...|$|E

40|$|A coiled finned-pipe heat {{exchanger}} {{was employed to}} extract heat rapidly, at temperatures in excess of 30 Â° C, from a 90 -litre hot-water charged tank; the water being initially at a temperature of approximately 80 Â° C. Free-convective buoyancy movements of the water around the outside of this coiled pipe (immersed in the store) occur {{as a result of}} initially-cold water (at ~ 20 Â° C) being forced internally through the {{heat exchanger}}'s pipe. For the most rapid rate of heat extraction, the axis of the heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil</b> should be oriented horizontally, and the heat exchanger's inlet arranged to be at the lowest level. Increasing the rate of water being passed through the heat exchanger's pipe resulted in a reduction of the heat exchanger's quality effectiveness, but a rise in the thermal store's recuperation effectiveness. The latter was due to the reduced level of mixing between the ascending warm streams and the descending colder streams. The development of the thermal boundary layer adjacent to the tank's wall was beneficial in deflecting the centrally descending stream of relatively colder water (which comes off the heat exchanger's pipe) to drive the ascending warmer water onto the heat exchanger, which is located near {{the surface of the water}} in the tank. ...|$|E

The objective was to predict the trajectories followed by particles exiting the turbine. Experiments had shown that the heat exchanger soils, which lie downstream of the turbine, would be ruptured by particles traveling {{in the order of}} 360 ft/sec. An axisymmetric solution of the flow was obtained from the work of Lin et. al., who used INS 3 D to obtain the solution.

40|$|AbstractGas coolers are heat {{rejection}} heat exchangers in vapour compression refrigeration systems that use carbon dioxide (CO 2) as refrigerant. The design of gas coolers {{has a significant}} influence {{on the performance of}} CO 2 refrigeration systems as it determines to a large extent the gas cooler/condenser pressure and the power consumption of the system. This paper investigates local refrigerant and air heat transfer coefficients in plain fin-and-tube gas cooler coils using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling. The aims were to provide insights into the variation of the local heat transfer rates in the coil and determine the influence of a) design enhancements {{such as the use of}} slit fins and b) to develop correlations for overall refrigerant and air heat transfer coefficients to be used in CO 2 refrigeration component and system modelling. The results from the model which was validated against experimental measurements showed that a horizontal slit on the fin between the first and second row of tubes can lead to an increase in the {{heat rejection}} rate of the gas cooler by between 6 % and 8 %. This in turn can lead to smaller heat exchanger heat transfer area for a given heat rejection capacity or lower high side pressure and higher efficiency for the refrigeration system.

A variant form of the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) change-detection algorithm is determined to be appropriate for detecting power transients which are used by the NILM to uniquely identify the start-up of electric end-uses.

40|$|In 2012 London Underground {{successfully}} installed two new innovative cooling technologies at Green Park and Oxford Circus. These cooling systems utilise bespoke platform {{air handling}} units (AHU’s) designed by London Underground for specific application in a tunnel environment. The units intake warm air dissipated by the trains as they stop at the stations. The air is cooled as it passes through specially designed water based cooling coils and then exhausted from the units directly onto the platforms where passengers are waiting. Building on this initial success London Underground has implemented a new R&D project to assess design options {{for the next generation}} of AHUs with the focus being on reducing whole life costs of future installations. One particular aspect of this R&D project was to investigate cleaning of the internal components of the units, which are subjected to air borne dust particles and therefore prone to performance losses. The aim of this investigation was to identify design options which reduce the maintenance requirements of the units and the need for regular track access, whilst maintaining the high cooling performance, thus providing significant cost savings to London Underground.

40|$|A 76 mm outlet {{diameter}} radial swirler with 8 mm vane depth {{was investigated in}} a 140 mm combustor diameter condensing 20 kW ultra-low NOx boiler. The aim was to show that small turbulent flames could achieve compact ultra-low NOx water heating. Low NOx was achieved using lean well mixed low flame temperature combustion with a 0. 7 equivalence ratio (Ø). Thermal NOx formation was also minimised by cooling the flame downstream of the swirler outlet. A water cooled heat transfer coil was traversed into the flame to determine how close to the swirler exit the heat transfer could occur, without a major increase in the combustion inefficiency. This was shown to be 70 mm from the radial swirler throat outlet. Rapid fuel and air mixing was achieved using fuel injection through {{the wall of the}} 76 mm swirler outlet throat, assisted by a 41 mm diameter outlet orifice at the exit of the 76 mm internal diameter wall fuel injector. This created swirling flow with higher axial velocities and a more concentrated high turbulence region downstream of the orifice outlet. A 4 mb burner pressure loss was used, which is typical of domestic forced draught combustion systems. The air inlet temperature was 400 K, which is typical of reverse air flow cooled combustion chambers at domestic water heater conditions. The strong swirling flow interaction with the heat <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil</b> give an 89 % thermal efficiency with the front of the coil 70 mm from the swirler outlet. The emissions measurements showed that the combustion inefficiency was below 0. 1 %, the CO/CO 2 ratio < 0. 001 and the NOx emissions were 5 ppm at 0 % oxygen with the heat exchanger at 70 mm from the radial swirler outlet.

Any process design that allows {{for the elimination of}} discharge points and the reduction of emissions at a major source can affect the strategic planning for the facility. This can provide critical flexibility, especially in fast-paced markets. Such a process design and implementation were undertaken at a ceramic capacitor manufacturing facility. This facility utilizes multiple small-scale solvent drying processes that emit volatile organic compounds (VOC's). These exhausts could be recirculated for the purposes of emission point elimination, heat recovery and solvent reuse. The aim was to create an environmental control process which would pay for itself within two to three years. An assessment of the alternatives was completed and standard HVAC-type condensation was selected. The unit operations for the proposed process consisted of a high efficiency air-to-air heat <b>exchanger,</b> cooling <b>coil</b> and a chiller. The air passing across the heat <b>exchanger</b> and <b>coil</b> would begin to dehumidify. In addition, solvents contained in the air stream would begin to condense to some equilibrium level and would be absorbed in the condensing water. Eventually, since there would be no addition of water in the process, the level of water in the condensate would fall off dramatically. A prototype unit capable of handling three ovens with a total air flow of 1200 ft 3 /min (cfm) was installed. The unit performed as expected with the exception that condensate concentrations remained low. Product testing was undertaken to ensure that returning air containing a low level of solvent would not adversely affect drying operations or product qualities. No adverse effects were found. Monitoring of the air stream verified solvent levels well below 5 % of the lower explosive limit. Finally, a large-scale unit was constructed capable of handling up to 171 ovens at up to 68, 000 cfm at a cost of $ 1. 2 M. At current levels of integration, cost avoidance (savings) performance is within 2 % of predicted values. Projected payback is 18 months.
