The grade of <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> is defined as an index which shows the strength of connection of a grain and a grain, and is usually estimated by bending strength. There are many papers about the relationship between the grade of a <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> and the <b>grinding</b> performance. Relationship between the grade of a <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> and the <b>grinding</b> performance is almost clear. Also, the relationship between mechanical properties of a <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> and the grade is also clear. On the other hand, since the grain layer of a super abrasive <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> is thin, it is difficult to apply the conventional evaluation test of the grade. The evaluation method of the grade which can be adapted the super abrasive <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> is not established. In addition, since the grade of a super abrasive <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> is a manufacture manufacturer's original standard, there is a minute difference by manufacturer. The super abrasive <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> as well as the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> is conjectured that the grade influences the grinding performance.

5000|$|The {{electrochemical}} grinding process combines traditional electrochemical machining and grinding processes to remove material from a workpiece. A <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is used as}} a cutting tool as a cathode and the workpiece is an anode. During the process, electrolytic fluid, typically sodium nitrate, is pumped into the space between the workpiece and the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel.</b> Other electrolytes used include sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and sodium chlorate. This electrolytic fluid will cause electrochemical reactions to occur at the workpiece surface which oxidize the surface, thereby removing material. As a consequence of the oxidation which occurs, layers of oxide films will form on the workpiece surface, and these need to be removed by the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel.</b> A couple schematics of the process are provided below.Abrasive materials, either diamond or aluminum oxide, are bonded to the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> which allows the wheel to remove the oxide layers on the workpiece surface by abrasive action. Appropriate materials used for electrolyte fluid and the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> abrasives are summarized in the table below.Most material removal is by the electrochemical reactions which occur at the workpiece surface. Five percent or less of the material removal is carried out by the abrasive action of the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel.</b> The fact that most material is not removed by abrasive action helps increase the life of the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel,</b> that is, the tool {{will take a long time}} to wear down.

As the wheel cuts, it periodically releases individual grains of abrasive, typically because they grow dull and the increased drag pulls them out of the bond.

2500|$|Thread {{grinding}} {{is done on}} {{a grinding}} machine using specially dressed <b>grinding</b> <b>wheels</b> matching {{the shape of the}} threads. The process is usually used to produce accurate threads or threads in hard materials; a common application is ball screw mechanisms. There are three types: center-type grinding with axial feed, center-type infeed thread grinding and centerless thread grinding. Center-type grinding with an axial feed is the most common of the three. It is similar to cutting a thread on a lathe with a single-point cutting tool, except the cutting tool is replaced with a grinding wheel. Usually a single ribbed wheel is used, although multiple ribbed wheels are also available. To complete the thread multiple passes are commonly required. Center-type infeed thread grinding use a grinding wheel with multiple ribs that is longer than the length of the desired thread. First, the grinding wheel is fed into the blank to the full thread depth. Then the blank is slowly rotated through approximately 1.5 turns while axially advancing through one pitch per revolution. Finally, the centerless thread grinding process is used to make head-less set screws in a similar method as centerless grinding. The blanks are hopper-fed to the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheels,</b> where the thread is fully formed. Common centerless thread grinding production rates are 60 to 70 pieces per minute for a [...] long set screw.|$|E
