The water in which it sank is 4,000 feet <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> where the Titanic sank. He attempted to determine whether it had been sunk by the British or was scuttled by its own crew. Three weeks after the expedition however, personal tragedy struck him when his 21-year-old son, Todd, who had aided him in the search, was killed in a car accident.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known predecessor to {{the bass}} drum was the Turkish davul, a cylindrical drum that featured two thin heads. The heads were stretched over hoops and then {{attached to a}} narrow shell. To play this instrument, a person would strike {{the right side of}} the davul with a large wooden stick, while the left side would be struck a rod. When struck, the davul produced a sound much <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of the other drums in existence. Because of this unique tone, davuls were used extensively in war and combat, where a deep and percussive sound was needed to ensure that the forces were marching in proper step with one another. The military bands of the Ottoman Janissaries in the 18th century were one of the first groups to utilize davuls in their music; Ottoman marching songs often had a heavy emphasis on percussion, and their military bands were primarily made up of davul, cymbal and kettle drum players.|$|E

500|$|Washington {{also claimed}} that American University cut off {{contact with him}} after he punched Tomjanovich. However, {{this appears to be}} a {{misrepresentation}} of certain events. When he tried to become athletic director of American in 1995, the school offered to hire him as assistant to the athletic director, since Washington had no front office experience. When confronted about this Washington stated: [...] "I didn't see why I couldn't be the AD so they could use my name out front and then have someone with more experience be my assistant." [...] John Feinstein and others have suggested that the most lasting damage caused by the fight between Washington and Tomjanovich has been to Washington's self-image, and his supposed refusal to accept responsibility for his actions in that fight.

500|$|Journalists likened Fez {{rotation}} mechanic to the 2D–3D {{shifts of}} games like Echochrome, Super Paper Mario, and Crush. Early in development, Fish himself {{said that the}} idea is [...] "nothing mind-blowing" [...] and that the game {{could have been made}} [...] "at any point in the last 15 years". Polygon Gies preferred how Echochrome used the perspective mechanic, and Tom McShea of GameSpot considered Fez mechanic a gimmick. Matt Miller of Game Informer thought that Fez realized the mechanic's potential better than other perspective-shifting games, and further commended Fez puzzle design and pacing up until the endgame. Miller also compared its story to that of the novella Flatland, whose protagonist similarly discovers the complexities of another dimension. 1UP.com Parish said that Fez rotation mechanic was <b>deeper</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of Super Paper Mario and not as dependent on M. C. Escher themes as Echochrome. Edge felt that the mechanic was [...] "far less self-conscious" [...] and [...] "more harmonious" [...] than in Endochrome and Crush. The magazine wrote that Fez indoor puzzles were its best. Eurogamer Welsh compared the game's [...] "wraparound platforming" [...] to the 1980s game Nebulus and described the rotation mechanic as among the console generation's [...] "most unusual technical challenges".|$|E

2500|$|The Yak-8 was an {{improved}} {{version of the}} Yakovlev Yak-6. It was slightly enlarged but retained its predecessor's mixed construction and general layout. The wooden semi-monocoque forward and central fuselage sections were skinned with a [...] layer of plywood both inside and outside. The rear fuselage was made from a tubular steel framework covered by fabric. The two-spar wooden wing was made in a single piece with fabric-covered ailerons. The main undercarriage retracted rearwards into {{the rear of the}} engine nacelles, but the castoring tailwheel was non-retractable. Two [...] Kossov M-12 engines were originally intended to be used, but they were unavailable and the [...] Shvetsov M-11FM had to be used instead.

30|$|Clift et al. (2015) {{estimated}} {{the amount of}} subsidence that would be anticipated based {{on the degree of}} subsidence that occurred prior to the onset of seafloor spreading, which would normally be considered the syn-rift period (> 30  Ma). This prediction was made based on the uniform extension model of McKenzie (1978) with the timing of the onset of seafloor spreading used {{as the end of the}} time of maximum continental extension. The results of this analysis suggested that the center of the basin had experienced beta factors of 2.7 – 3.4. If such values are realistic then it is possible to predict the long-term post-rift, thermal subsidence that occurred after extension ceased. Figure  5 shows that the predicted post-rift subsidence results in a basin that is substantially less <b>deep</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> actually observed today. Indeed, the predicted curves begin to diverge from the reconstructed depth to basement starting around 20  Ma and now amount to more than 1  km of anomaly of the unloaded basement depth.|$|R
