500|$|In 1994, Conran {{set up a}} bluescreen in {{his living}} room and began {{assembling}} the tools he would need to create his movie. He was not interested in working his way through the system and instead wanted to follow the route of independent filmmakers like Steven Soderbergh. Initially, Kerry and his brother had nothing more than [...] "just a vague idea of this guy who flew a plane. We would talk about all the obvious things like Indiana Jones and all the stuff we liked." [...] Conran spent four years making a black and white teaser trailer in the style of an old-fashioned movie serial on his Macintosh IIci personal computer. Once he was finished, Conran showed it to producer Marsha Oglesby, who was a friend of his brother's wife and she recommended that he let producer Jon Avnet see it. Conran met Avnet and showed him the trailer. Conran told him that he wanted to make it into a movie. They spent two or three days <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the tone of the movie.|$|E
500|$|Watch the Throne {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 76, based on 42 reviews. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club wrote that [...] "exhilarating messiness and go-for-broke spontaneity infect Jay-Z and push him outside his comfort zone {{and into a}} realm of intense emotional reflection." [...] Pitchforks Tom Breihan felt that it [...] "works best when Jay and Kanye are <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> how great they are," [...] adding that [...] "Kanye is this album's obvious guiding force ... He displays levels of unequaled audacity." [...] Claire Suddath of Time called it [...] "a beautifully decadent album by two of hip-hop's finest artists—men {{with a lot of}} things to say and a lot of money to spend." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph praised West's [...] "attention to detail" [...] and found their [...] "wit and absurdity [...] entirely suited to the epic scale of productions." [...] Kitty Empire of The Observer stated, [...] "Some find this sort of branded gloating distasteful, but at their best both rappers can still make you laugh." [...] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times deemed it [...] "a cocksure, fiery, smart, if problematic, collaboration that showcases the pair's distinct lyrical skills." [...] Julian Benbow of The Boston Globe observed [...] "an undeniable synergy that they embraced for this project." [...] AllMusic editor Andy Kellman called it [...] "an audacious spectacle of vacuous pomposity as well as one of tremendous lyrical depth." ...|$|E

I'm talking about what they see on TV and on the Internet. I'm {{concerned}} about the drug culture, I'm concerned about the pornography, the violence, the sex, the perversions that they see day in and day out. I {{want to make sure that}} every computer that goes into a home in the future, has a button there, or a place for the citizen, the parent, to be able to block all of that pornography from their kids' Internet screen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pitchfork stated [...] "T.I. {{has always}} been a great rapper, warm and fluid and confident, his loose elastic voice winding under tracks with force and finesse. Before every other {{mainstream}} rapper was talking about drugs, he was doing it with a weary lived-in authority, proudly defiant and sheepishly defensive at the same time, bragging about getting money but lamenting the fact that he only had one way to do it. But great rappers don't always make great albums, and every one of T.I.'s previous full-lengths had a fatal flaw: desperate grabs at radio love, grossly insincere sex-jams, cobbled-together non-cohesion, or all three. Last summer, I thought Young Jeezy's [...] (2005) was the album T.I. should've made. Young Jeezy isn't half the rapper that T.I. is, but his album-- stunning in its focus and monolithic swagger and deeply nihilistic in worldview-- had more cinematic sweep than anything his progenitor had ever done." [...] Matt Cibula of PopMatters described the album as a stunning classic saying that [...] "Clifford “T.I.” Harris is one of America’s greatest songwriters. I’m not <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> hip-hop, either—even if you add in all the other genres that people go all gaga over, T.I. strides this narrow world like a colossus. No one is smarter, no one constructs tighter songs, and no one has more ways to score. This is proven over and over again on King. T.I. is the whole package: gritty, smooth, smart, dangerous, introspective, and wise. And while it’s pretty early in 2006 to talk about albums of the year, this record says it’s time to start talking." [...] Stylus Magazine noted [...] "T.I.’s path to a self-made mythology hinges not just on his ability to trumpet himself, but to make his locale and history vital. King, T.I.’s latest, proves, among other things, that his legacy is tied into his town, and his town, Atlanta, is the true Southern metropolis: primal, spiritual, refined, and delicate at the same time. New Orleans may have the painful religious symbolism, Memphis the working-class spirit, and Houston the expansive, halting sound, but Atlanta is the melting pot of bourgeoisie, aristocracy, and neighborhood hustlers. Lil Wayne may be the chaperone of this coast, but T.I. is the CFO. Song to song production is generally top-shelf. From barn-burning “Top Back” to the slyly tender “Gone,” every chime chimes when it’s supposed to, every snare clacks right into place. Individually, Grand Hustle in-house rising star Toomp gobbles up the lion’s share of the praise: the cataclysmic “What You Know” and ostentatious “Bankhead” both soar. Mannie Fresh and Just Blaze inlay T.I.’s lines with velveteen strings and swirling drums respectively. King isn’t complacent enough to act like all the wars are fought and all the gods are dead; T.I. sees his legacy and city very much up for grabs. A city, a scene and his legacy are unfinished, and while King won’t be T.I.’s last, or, hopefully, best section of his mosaic, it’s the perfection of his aesthetic thus far." ...|$|E
