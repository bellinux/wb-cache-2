To fund this, the host solicits donations from sympathetic corporations such as Barclays, Fiat Automobiles, GlaxoSmithKline, Heinz, Nokia and Xerox.|$|E

25|$|The problem—which also {{exists in}} the State Senate—can be boiled down to a single {{overarching}} issue: The Assembly speaker has too much power. He controls everything, from the legislation that can be voted on to how his normally docile members vote on it. He <b>decides</b> <b>what</b> the Assembly will accept in a state budget. He negotiates secretly {{with the other two}} leaders to hammer out important, expensive and far-reaching laws. And he ignores the wishes of less-exalted lawmakers.|$|E
25|$|Usually, the bowler <b>decides</b> <b>what</b> type of {{delivery}} to bowl next, without consultation or even informing any {{other member of}} his team. Sometimes, the team captain will offer advice or even issue a direct order regarding what deliveries to bowl, based on his observations of the batsman and the strategic state of the game. Another player who occasionally offers advice to the bowler is the wicket-keeper, since he has a unique view of the batsman and {{may be able to}} spot weaknesses of technique.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 {{the current}} {{championship}} structure was adopted, whereby {{the winners of}} the Leinster and Munster championships advanced to the All Ireland semi finals, and the 2 losers of the provincial finals advance to 2 quarter finals.

The new qualifier structure, has provided more games and has given hope to the 'weaker' teams, as a defeat in the first round no longer means the end of a county's All-Ireland ambitions.|$|E

25|$|Although Malagasy {{women have}} {{increasingly}} begun to use contraceptives, both oral and injected, those used are not enough; only 1.5 {{percent of women}} use implanted contraceptives. The abortion rate is estimated at 1 in 10, with 24 percent of women having undergone an abortion. Fifteen percent of married women wishing to use contraceptives {{have no access to}} family planning initiatives.

25|$|Bakunin {{argues that}} oppressors receive {{authority}} from religion. Religious {{people are in}} many cases obedient to the priests, because many religious people believe that the statements of priests are based on direct divine revelation or scripture. The obedience to divine revelation or scripture is considered as the ethical criteria by many religious people, because God is considered as the omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being. Therefore, each statement which is considered derived from an infallible God cannot be criticized by humans. According to this religious way of thinking, humans cannot know by themselves what is just, but that only God <b>decides</b> <b>what</b> is good or wrong. People who disobey the “messengers of God” are threatened with punishment in hell.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, {{others argue}} that the poem focuses mostly on the opinions, actions, and {{abilities}} of men. For example, on the surface, it appears that Bertilak's wife is a strong leading character. By adopting the masculine role, she {{appears to be an}} empowered individual, particularly in the bedroom scene. This is not entirely the case, however. While the Lady is being forward and outgoing, Gawain's feelings and emotions are the focus of the story, and Gawain stands to gain or lose the most. The Lady [...] "makes the first move", so to speak, but Gawain ultimately <b>decides</b> <b>what</b> is to become of those actions.

500|$|In {{obscuring}} reality, truth becomes unclear. As {{literary critic}} Mireille Rosello notes, {{it is the}} President who <b>decides</b> <b>what</b> is true, denying any other opinion, even if other characters witness an event with their own eyes or ears. Unlike {{the characters in the}} novel, readers are aware that the characters are relying on a notion of truth or reality that no longer exists under the dictatorship of the President. [...] "Truth" [...] does not exist before the President puts it into words, and even at that, the only [...] "truth" [...] under dictatorial rule is the words the President is speaking at any given momentone cannot even safely repeat the President's versions of events. The characters are thus left unaware of what constitutes the [...] "truth".|$|E

We're just absorbing all the words thrown at us from the TV and regurgitating them back." [...] Frustration with the George Bush administration and its foreign policy influenced the record with Rhys claiming that he feels qualified to address the subject as United States foreign policy [...] "effectively <b>decides</b> <b>what</b> the foreign policy is in the UK".|$|E

500|$|In combat mode, {{the screen}} changes to a {{top-down}} mode with dimetric projection, where the player <b>decides</b> <b>what</b> actions the characters will take in each round. These actions are taken immediately, rather than after all commands {{have been issued}} as is standard in some RPGs. Optionally, the player can let the computer choose character moves for each round. Characters and monsters may make an extra attack on a retreating enemy that moves next to them. If a character's hit points (HP) fall below zero, {{he or she must}} be bandaged by another character or the character will die. The game contains random encounters, and game reviewers for Dragon magazine observed that random encounters seem to follow standard patterns of encounter tables in pen and paper AD game manuals. They also observed that the depictions of monsters confronting the party [...] "looked as though they had jumped from the pages of the Monster Manual." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{previously}} {{announcing his}} international retirement following the 2014 World Cup, Pirlo reversed his decision, and under new Italy manager, and Pirlo's former Juventus manager Antonio Conte, Pirlo {{returned to the}} Italian squad. On 10 October, Pirlo started in Italy's second Euro 2016 qualifying match, which ended in a 2–1 home win over Azerbaijan, overtaking Zoff with his 113th appearance for Italy. Pirlo assisted Chiellini's first goal of the match from a corner kick. In August 2015, Pirlo was called for Italy's Euro 2016 qualifying matches against Malta and Bulgaria in September; he appeared in Italy's 1–0 home victory over Malta on 3 September, becoming the first MLS player to represent Italy; this was his final international appearance. In total, Pirlo made four appearances under Conte, as Italy qualified for Euro 2016 on 10 October in a 3–1 win over Azerbaijan. On 23 May 2016, Pirlo, along with fellow MLS compatriot Giovinco, was left off of Conte's 30-player shortlist for Italy's Euro 2016 squad. Regarding their omission, Conte commented in a press conference: [...] "When you make a certain choice and go to play in certain leagues, you do so taking it into account that they could pay the consequences from a footballing viewpoint". In response to Conte's comments, Pirlo stated to Sky Italia: [...] "I have spoken to Conte {{and there is no}} disappointment on my part, he knows {{what he has to do}} and what he should not do. We had discussions during the season and both parties made their own decisions. He is the coach and it's only right he makes his decisions and <b>decides</b> <b>what</b> is best for him.
