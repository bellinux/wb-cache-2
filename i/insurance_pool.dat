25|$|One {{historical}} {{problem with}} the U.S. system was known as job lock, in which people become tied to their jobs for fear of losing their health insurance. This reduces {{the flexibility of the}} labor market. Federal legislation passed since the mid-1980s, particularly COBRA and HIPAA, has been aimed at reducing job lock. However, providers of group health insurance in many states are permitted to use experience rating and it remains legal in the United States for prospective employers to investigate a job candidate's health and past health claims as part of a hiring decision. Someone who has recently been diagnosed with cancer, for example, may face job lock not out of fear of losing their health insurance, but based on prospective employers not wanting to add the cost of treating that illness to their own health <b>insurance</b> <b>pool,</b> for fear of future insurance rate increases. Thus, being diagnosed with an illness can cause someone to be forced to stay in their current job.|$|E

There are 35 state high-risk <b>insurance</b> <b>pools</b> across the country serving approximately 200, 000 people. The U. S. Congress is considering various proposals to expand high risk pool coverage as part of health care reform to cover people with pre-existing conditions. However, data suggest that high risk pools as currently proposed will not adequately meet the needs of those with potentially serious health conditions. Many risk pool enrollees fall into a gray area between being chronically ill, but able to work at least part-time, and being disabled to the point of qualifying for federal disability programs and their accompanying health care coverage. As Congress astutely noted in its 1999 Ticket to Work legislation, moving just one half of one percent of people off of disability programs and back into the workforce would result in $ 3. 5 billion in federal savings. Preventing one-half of one percent of people from being added to the disability rolls would result in an additional net savings of $ 3. 5 billion to the federal government. 1 Current High Risk Pool Costs and Coverage In 2008, lawmakers called for the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to examine the abilit...|$|R
