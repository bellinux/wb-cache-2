5|$|Kiarostami's complex sound-images and {{philosophical}} approach have caused frequent comparisons with mystical filmmakers such as Andrei Tarkovsky and Robert Bresson. Irrespective of substantial cultural differences, much of western writing about Kiarostami positions {{him as the}} Iranian equivalent of such directors, by virtue of universal austere, spiritual poetics and moral commitment. Some draw parallels between certain <b>imagery</b> <b>in</b> Kiarostami's films with that of Sufi concepts.|$|E
40|$|The use {{of remote}} sensing data from LANDSAT (ERTS) <b>imageries</b> <b>in</b> identifying, {{evaluating}} and mapping land use {{patterns of the}} Haor area in Bangladesh was investigated. Selected cloud free imageries of the area for the period 1972 - 75 were studied. <b>Imageries</b> <b>in</b> bands 4, 5 and 7 were mostly used.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} availability of high-spatial-resolution remote sensing imageries {{and with the}} observed limitations of pixel-based techniques, the development and testing of geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) techniques for image classification have {{become one of the}} main research areas in geospatial science. This paper examines and compares the classification performance of a pixel-based method and an object-based method as applied to high- (QuickBird satellite image) and medium- (Landsat TM image) spatial-resolution <b>imageries</b> <b>in</b> the context of urban and suburban landscapes. For the pixel-based classification, the maximum-likelihood supervised classification approach was employed. And for the object-based classification, the pixel-based classified maps were integrated with a set of image segments produced using various calibrations. The results show evidence that the object-based method can produce classifications that are more accurate for both high- and medium-spatial- resolution <b>imageries</b> <b>in</b> the context of urban and suburban landscapes...|$|R

5|$|Around 180 BCE the Indo-Greek king Agathocles issued some coinage bearing {{images of}} deities {{that are now}} {{interpreted}} as being related to Vaisnava <b>imagery</b> <b>in</b> India. The deities displayed on the coins appear to be Vishnu's avatars Balarama-Sankarshana with attributes consisting of the Gada mace and the plow, and Vasudeva-Krishna with attributes of the Shankha (conch) and the Sudarshana Chakra wheel. According to Bopearachchi, the headdress {{on top of the}} deity is actually a misrepresentation of a shaft with a half-moon parasol on top (chattra).|$|E

5|$|Both {{the frames}} and {{pictorial}} {{areas of the}} diptych are heavily inscribed with lettering and phrases in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for inscriptions, which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative while also functioning {{in a manner similar}} to the commentaries often seen on the margins of medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and <b>imagery</b> <b>in</b> unison.|$|E
5|$|Building on {{his late}} 1950s {{drawings}} of comic strips characters, Look Mickey marks Lichtenstein's first full employment of painterly techniques to reproduce almost faithful representations {{of pop culture}} and so satirize and comment upon the then developing process of mass production of visual <b>imagery.</b> <b>In</b> this, Lichtenstein pioneered a motif that became influential not only in 1960s pop art but continuing {{to the work of}} artists today. Lichtenstein borrows from a Donald Duck illustrated story book, showing Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck during a fishing mishap. However, he makes significant alterations to the original source, including modifying the color scheme and perspective, while seeming to make statements about himself.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Landsea {{noted that}} the efforts to reanalyze the Atlantic {{hurricane}} database {{will not be able}} to recover observations of open ocean tropical cyclones that were just never taken. Researchers cannot assume that the Atlantic tropical cyclone database presents a complete depiction of frequency of events before the advent of satellite <b>imagery</b> <b>in</b> the mid-1960s. Moreover, newly available advanced tools and techniques are also contributing toward monitoring about one additional Atlantic tropical cyclone per year since 2002. Thus large, long-term 'trends' in tropical cyclone frequency are primarily manifestations of increased monitoring capabilities and likely not related to any real change in the climate in which they develop.|$|E

5|$|Damage was {{heaviest}} in Myanmar {{where the}} storm moved ashore, and winds of 157km/h (98mph) were reported. Widespread areas reported winds of 40km/h (25mph). The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission estimated {{that up to}} 500mm (20in) of precipitation fell along the Bay of Bengal coast in Myanmar and Bangladesh. There were reports of waves 15m (50ft) in height along the coast. A high storm surge and coastal flooding inundated four towns in Rakhine State, causing damage to water systems. Flooding was visible on satellite <b>imagery</b> <b>in</b> the days following the cyclone. Eight townships in the state were affected, five of them severely.|$|E
5|$|In Buah Rindu, Amir {{shows an}} {{affinity}} for using traditional Malay poetic forms such as the quatrain, but unlike the highly fixed traditional forms, he mixes the rhyming patterns. The text is dominated by terms related to love and searching, and according to Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw the collection is united by a theme of longing. Johns states that the <b>imagery</b> <b>in</b> Buah Rindu is dependent on traditional Malay literature, and that Amir's terminology is heavily influenced by classical Malay poetry. The author's use of language is also notably coloured by Javanese terms and ideas, and another source of influence appears to be Indian literature, with references to Hindu gods and goddesses.|$|E
5|$|Jackson began storyboarding {{the series}} with Christian Rivers in August 1997 and {{assigned}} his crew to begin designing Middle-earth {{at the same}} time. Jackson hired long-time collaborator Richard Taylor to lead Weta Workshop on five major design elements: armour, weapons, prosthetics/make-up, creatures, and miniatures. In November 1997, famed Tolkien illustrators Alan Lee and John Howe joined the project. Most of the <b>imagery</b> <b>in</b> the films is based on their various illustrations.

5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans celebrated phallic {{festivals and}} built a shrine with an erect phallus to honor Hermes, {{messenger}} of the gods. Those figures {{may be related to}} the ancient Egyptian deity Min who was depicted holding his erect phallus. Figures of women with a phallus for a head have been found across Greece and Yugoslavia. Phallic symbolism was prevalent in the architectural tradition of ancient Babylon. The Romans, who were deeply superstitious, also often used phallic <b>imagery</b> <b>in</b> their architecture and domestic items. The ancient cultures of many parts of the Far East, including Indonesia, India (such as the Lingam), Korea and Japan, used the phallus as a symbol of fertility in motifs on their temples and in other areas of everyday life.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Christine {{originated}} from a tropical wave over Africa in late-August. As it neared the Atlantic Ocean, the wave spawned a tropical depression at 14.0°W, {{over the country}} of Guinea, on August25. The formation of this depression was farther east than any other tropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic hurricane basin, although storms may have gone undetected {{prior to the start}} of satellite <b>imagery</b> <b>in</b> the 1960s. This record would not be approached by any other storm until Hurricane Jeanne in 1998, which formed at 17.4°W. This was unlike most cyclone producing waves which travel several hundred miles over water before spawning a depression. Tracking nearly due west, the depression moved over water several hours later and bypassed the Cape Verde Islands on August 27.|$|E

5|$|Early on 20 January, the BOM {{upgraded}} the low to {{a tropical}} cyclone, {{at which time}} it was given the name Magda. However, there is uncertainty whether the system actually obtained this strength or if it strengthened hours later. At {{the time of the}} upgrade, Magda featured deep convection over its centre, but banding features extended a little more than halfway around the circulation. Later that day, the small cyclone underwent a period of rapid intensification as an eye feature became apparent in satellite <b>imagery.</b> <b>In</b> response to an approaching trough, Magda tracked towards the southeast. Around 2100UTC, the JTWC issued their first advisory on Magda, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 08S. Over the following several hours, the eye feature became increasingly defined, allowing the storm to intensify into a severe tropical cyclone by 0000UTC on 21 January. Upon reaching this strength, Magda attained ten-minute sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph) and a barometric pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg). However, shear abruptly increased hours later, causing the low-level circulation of Magda to become displaced from the deepest convection.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} that the Atlantic {{hurricane}} basin has been thoroughly studied since 1851, {{there was only one}} other storm prior to Hurricane Fred to attain Category 3 intensity south of 30°N and east of 35°W. This storm was Hurricane Frances in 1980. Frances attained major hurricane status farther south and east than Fred; however, Fred was the strongest of the two, peaking with estimated winds of 120mph (195km/h) and a minimum pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg). Just over a year later, this intensity record was broken by Hurricane Julia, which attained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a pressure of 948mbar (hPa; 27.99inHg) at 17.7°N and 32.2°W, becoming the easternmost-forming Category4 hurricane on record. In one of the NHC's discussions on Hurricane Fred, it was mentioned that due to the unusual location of a storm of its intensity, the hurricane would likely have gone unnoticed before the advent of satellite <b>imagery</b> <b>in</b> the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Only six {{tropical}} cyclones {{were observed}} in the Eastern Pacific during this season, which is well below the 1949–2006 average of 13 per year. Of the six tropical cyclones, two only attained hurricane status. In addition, none of the tropical cyclones became a major hurricane, which is Category 3 or greater on Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Although it is an oddity for no major hurricanes to occur during a season since the satellite era began, nearly all hurricane seasons during this time period lacked a major hurricane. However, {{it is likely that}} other tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific basin in 1949 went operationally unnoticed, due to lack of modern technology such as satellite <b>imagery.</b> <b>In</b> addition to the six tropical cyclones, another tropical cyclone developed in the Eastern Pacific basin, but was included in the Atlantic basin hurricane database, rather than the Eastern Pacific. Most of the seven tropical cyclones did not differentiate in intensity during the duration, with the exception of Hurricane Six. The first two tropical cyclones of the season formed in quick succession in during mid-June, however, the months of July and August went dormant in terms of tropical cyclogenesis. The last five tropical cyclones, including the additional storm, also developed in a quick sequence, all of which forming from in a span of 17 days. By October 1, all tropical cyclonic activity had completely ceased.|$|E

40|$|Mental {{imagery is}} used {{extensively}} by musicians {{as well as}} by athletes in sport. As performers, musicians and athletes strive to achieve excellence. Preparation is an essential precursor to performance and the use of mental imagery is a common method of achieving this state. In the sport psychology literature an applied model of imagery use has been proposed, the model suggests that the sport situation (i. e. training, competing, rehabilitation) will dictate the function of imagery used (e. g. arousal regulation, skill rehearsal), and this in turn will impact the outcome (e. g. feelings of efficacy, technique). Relevant mental <b>imagery</b> research <b>in</b> sport and music is reviewed, making links across the disciplines in an attempt to inform research and practice.
