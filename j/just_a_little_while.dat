5|$|After Picard is {{returned}} to the schoolroom, the lead Ferengi threatens to harm the children if Riker does not unlock the computer and teach his lieutenant how to operate the Enterprise. Riker pretends to instruct the Ferengi officer, but only spouts deliberately meaningless technobabble as he unlocks the computer console in Picard's schoolroom. With command functions enabled, Picard is able to activate a transporter safety function. With help from Worf's son, Alexander Rozhenko (Brian Bonsall), Guinan, and Ro, they use communication badges to trap most of the Ferengi on a transporter pad with their weapons disarmed and the exit blocked by a force field. Once {{most of them are}} detained, the children and Riker are able to overpower the remaining members and retake the Enterprise. After the events, the transporter is used to return Picard, Guinan, and Keiko to their adult states. Ro, buoyed by her experience, decides to remain a child for <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> longer and draw some pictures, something she never did during her childhood.|$|E

5000|$|The {{theory can}} be easily applied to the whole of existence, except for the theory itself. When doing so, we {{seemingly}} disprove it: either it is a mistake, or {{we do not know}} it. Therefore, Cimrman created a revolutionary solution: Cimrman's [...] "Step-Aside".

Irène was an easier prey than Lydie. She was his wife and her ambitions were bound up with his; her mistrust only came from jealousy, and jealousy in a woman is so easily conquered momentarily, if she be beautiful and young and the man ardent and unscrupulous.|$|R
40|$|The {{community}} of destinies, {{as well as}} the varied historical meetings along the time between notable Spanish representatives and representatives of the African continent have exercised a profound influence over several aspects of the Hispanic-African cultural confluences.

She was described as well-dressed, about 22 years of age, with protruding teeth and a [...] "cultured" [...] voice and she identified herself as [...] "Julia Otis". After listening to the Moroneys' problems, she asked Catherine if she could take Mary Agnes to California with her, <b>just</b> for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while,</b> adding that she would be unrecognisable and [...] "fat as a butterball".

Amanda leaves Rebecca and the Abbey of St. Anne in 853; as a departure gift, Rebecca gives Amanda {{a piece of her}} crystal The Methuselah Stone, something she had done before with some of her other pupils.

40|$|Strange {{as it may}} seem, the gray, oppressive USSR {{was founded}} on a fairy tale.

And <b>just</b> for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while,</b> in the heady years of the late 1950 s, the magic seemed to be working. Red Plenty is about that moment in history, and how it came, and how it went away; about the brief era when, under the rash leadership of Khrushchev, the Soviet Union looked forward to a future of rich communists and envious capitalists, when Moscow would out-glitter Manhattan and every Lada would be better engineered than a Porsche. It’s about the scientists who did their genuinely brilliant best to make the dream come true, to give the tyranny its happy ending. Red Plenty is history, it’s fiction, it’s as ambitious as Sputnik, as uncompromising as an Aeroflot flight attendant, and as different from what you were expecting as a glass of Soviet champagne...|$|R

60|$|The boys {{went into}} the woods, and got pawpaw branches, and came back and fought the {{bumblebees}} till they drove them off.

40|$|Technology is an {{innovation}} that can offer much {{to facilitate a}} transformative social studies approach. The paper discuss-es the potential for technology in social studies teacher edu-cation by providing survey and interview results and models and examples for successful integration. The suggestion is that technology can provide opportunities for empowering students and teachers, but meaningful, student-centered critical constuctivist approaches are vital. The model pre-sented includes modeling and applying, reflecting, involving students actively, and developing a community of learners with a technology focus throughout the entire social studies education experience.

500|$|The tour {{concluded}} with the November 22, 2009, show at HSBC Arena in Buffalo, New York. [...] Fans came {{from far away}} and the show dominated {{the feel of the}} city that day. [...] The full album played was Springsteen's first, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., which he wryly said [...] "was the miracle. This was the record that took everything from way below zero to ... one." [...] The performance of it was dedicated to his first manager and producer, Mike Appel, who was present in the audience, and featured quite rare renditions of [...] "Mary Queen of Arkansas" [...] and (the first ever with the E Street Band) [...] "The Angel". [...] Other rarities peppered the 34-song, nearly 3½-hour night, including Chuck Willis's [...] "(I Don't Want to) Hang Up My Rock and Roll Shoes" [...] and, to mark Steven Van Zandt's birthday, totally obscure outtake [...] "Restless Nights" [...] (supposedly Van Zandt's favorite Springsteen song) and a now-unusual second song from the current album, [...] "Surprise Surprise". [...] Near the end he said, [...] "So we're gonna say goodbye, but <b>just</b> for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> ... <b>a</b> very <b>little</b> <b>while</b> ..." [...] The tour finished not with the emotional statement in song that some other Springsteen tours have in the 2000s, but instead with John Fogerty's [...] "Rockin' All Over the World".|$|R

But wouldn't they suffer more if he did not confront this conflict as his hard training dictated? He was almost afraid to turn and look at Lucy. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> before he had promised her forbearance. So his amaze was great when she faced him, violet eyes ablaze, to clasp him, and creep close to him, with lingering traces of fear giving way to woman's admiration and love.|$|E

You see, the odor of that perfume which he had thrown at Reddy Fox <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> before was very, very strong there, and Jimmy knew that until that had {{disappeared}} no one would come near the place because it was so unpleasant for every one. To Jimmy himself it wasn't unpleasant at all, and he couldn't understand why other people disliked it so. He had puzzled over that a great deal. He was glad that it was so, because on account of it every one treated him with respect and took special pains not to quarrel with him.|$|E
50|$|Juliette is {{rushed to}} the hospital, where the doctor tells her {{that she has to}} cancel the tour immediately. Avery shows up at the hospital, but leaves when Noah comes in. Juliette, though, tracks him down and tells him if he wants to be the baby's father, he'll need to let her be a part of his life as well. Avery, though, tells Juliette that he will get to be the baby's father on his terms. Juliette later reveals her {{pregnancy}} to the media as why she's cancelling her tour, and admits that Avery is the father when a reporter asks. Around the one-year anniversary of her mother's death, Juliette has flashbacks of her childhood. At the CMA's Juliette meets Avery's parents; his mom adores her while his father doesn't. When walking back to her seat she overhears his dad saying that he doesn't think that she and Avery will make good parents and brings up her past. Avery vows that they won't be like their parents. Juliette tells him that they are having a girl. Weeks after the CMA's, Juliette asks Avery to move in with her after the baby is born <b>just</b> for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while.</b> Avery later asks Juliette to marry him, she says yes, and they have a judge marry them. After canceling her baby shower, Juliette's water breaks while arguing with Rayna. She is {{rushed to the}} hospital where she has her baby girl, Cadence. After having Cadence, Juliette is more focused on her career than the baby and neglects her. Emily is concerned and informs Avery.

[...] Mickey and his car both sit {{next to each other}} feeling jealous and grumpy about being teased by Mortimer. Meanwhile, Mortimer is still doing his bullfighting thing. His first {{attempts}} went well, mostly by making the bull charge into the fences around its pen, but when Mortimer sees the pen's gate open and as he's about to do a second one, he immediately yelps, runs away and flees in his sports car, leaving Minnie to deal with the bull alone. The bull chases Minnie. Mickey realizes that Minnie is in danger and calls for his car. As soon as his car turns up, Mickey jumps inside and goes off to save Minnie Mouse from the angered bull. He goes round in a circle creating a dust cloud so that it confuses the bull. Minnie sees Mickey driving around in his car and then jumps in where she is safe and sound. Then Mickey asks Minnie if Mortimer is her new boyfriend. But Minnie politely denies this and tells him that he is just one of her old friends who <b>just</b> came for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while.</b> Then Mickey and Minnie Mouse both shake hands.|$|R
6000|$|But is it so? If {{the mass}} of common men are incurably {{patriotic}} and belligerent why is there a note of querulous exhortation in nearly all patriotic literature? Why, for instance, is Mr. Rudyard Kipling's [...] "History of England" [...] so full of goading and scolding? And very significant indeed to any student of the human outlook was the world-response to President Wilson's advocacy of the League of Nations idea, in its first phase in 1918, before the weakening off and disillusionment of the Versailles Conference. <b>Just</b> for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> it seemed that President Wilson stood for a new order {{of things in the}} world, that he had the wisdom and will and power to break the net of hatreds and nationalisms and diplomacies in which the Old World was entangled. And while he seemed to be capable of that, while he promised most in the way of change and national control, then it was that he found his utmost support in every country in the world. In the latter half of 1918 there was scarcely a country anywhere in which one could not have found men ready to die for President Wilson. A great hopefulness was manifest in the world. It faded, it faded very rapidly again. But that brief wave of enthusiasm, which set minds astir with the same great idea of one peace of justice throughout the earth in China and Bokhara and the Indian bazaars, in Iceland and Basutoland and Ireland and Morocco, was indeed a fact perhaps more memorable in history even than the great war itself. It displayed a possibility of the simultaneous operation of the same general ideas throughout the world quite beyond any previous experience. It demonstrated that the generality of men are as capable of being cosmopolitan and pacifist as they are of being patriotic and belligerent. Both moods are extensions and exaltations beyond the everyday life, which itself is neither one thing nor the other. And both are transitory moods, responses to external suggestion.|$|R
