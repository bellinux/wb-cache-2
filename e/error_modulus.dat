40|$|Abstract- The paper {{presents}} {{a prototype of}} EIS analyzer, which uses digital potentiostat/galvanostat. The separate paths and AD converters were used for sampling DC and AC components of signals proportional to current through and voltage across the impedance of the measured object. The converters are controlled by different processors, which performs functions tightly connected with realization of two tasks of EIS analyzer: potentiostat/galvanostat controlling and impedance measuring. In order to decrease {{the influence of the}} real-life parameters of used operational amplifiers and the parasitic capacitances on the error of impedance measurement, the correction taking those parameters into account has been used in the algorithm for determination of impedance parameters of the measured objects. Performed tests proved benefits appearing from correction implemented in the algorithm.

40|$|We re-analyze the {{detectability}} {{of large}} scale dark flow (or local bulk flow) {{with respect to}} the CMB background based upon the redshift-distance relation for Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia). We made two independent analyses: one based upon identifying the three Cartesian velocity components; and the other based upon the cosine dependence of the deviation from Hubble flow on the sky. We apply these analyses to the Union 2. 1 SN Ia data and to the SDSS-II supernova survey. For both methods, results for low redshift, z 0. 05 is inconclusive. Based upon simulated data sets, we deduce that the difficulty in detecting a dark flow at high redshifts arises mostly from the observational error in the distance modulus. Thus, even if it exists, a dark flow is not detectable at large redshift with current SN Ia data sets. We estimate that a detection would require both significant sky coverage of SN Ia out to z = 0. 3 and a reduction in the effective distance <b>modulus</b> <b>error</b> from 0. 2 mag to ≲ 0. 02 mag. We estimate that a greatly expanded data sample of ∼ 10 ^ 4 SN Ia might detect a dark flow as small as 300 km s^- 1 out to z = 0. 3 even with a distance <b>modulus</b> <b>error</b> of 0. 2 mag.

The test employed a cylindrical aluminum AA 2024 -T 351 test specimen. Participants measured elastic modulus and 0. 2 % offset yield strength, YS(0. 2 % offset), using an extensometer attached to the specimen. The repeatability and reproducibility of the yield strength measurement, expressed as coefficient of variations were cv(sub r) = 0. 011 and cv(sub R) = 0. 020 The reproducibility of the test across the laboratories was among the best that has been reported for uniaxial tests.

When the stationary slowness direction is found, all quantities standing in the Green's function such as the slowness vector, polarization vector, phase and energy velocities and principal curvatures of the slowness surface can readily be calculated. The formulae for the exact and asymptotic Green's functions are numerically checked against closed-form solutions for isotropic and simple anisotropic, elastic and viscoelastic models.

In the double-transition model the Constitution data shows deviation outside 1 sigma from LCDM model at low (z < 0. 2) and middle (0. 2 < z < 0. 4) redshift bins whereas no such deviations are noticeable in the Union and Union 2 data.

The observed results at Ikunomake it clear that changes of maximum tilt direction and principal strain axis have occurredsystematically. These phenomena suggest time changes of stress field in the northwesternpart of Kinki District. To confirm these stress changes, in Jan. 1988, measurement of three-dimensional absolutecrustal stress was made using hydro-fracturing methods in three boreholes near the observa-tion station. In Aug. 1988, using the same boreholes, the measurements of absolute stresswere again made repeatedly. Then, stress changes were estimated and further, strainchanges were calculated through the stress-strain relation in the two-dimensional modeling. The obtained data were finally comparative-studied with those data obtained by the exten-someters. Because of the fact that absolute stress values themselves are low, measurements werenot very accurate. On the other hand, the amounts of observed strain changes, due to cavityeffect and inhomogeneity of rock in the observational tunnel, lead to noticeable errors ofanalysis.

40|$|More than 250 plugs from {{outcrops}} {{and three}} nearby boreholes in an undisturbed reef of Miocene (Tortonian) age were quantitatively analyzed for texture, mineralogy, and acoustic properties. We measured the P- and S-waves of carbonate rocks under dry (humidified) and brine-saturated conditions at 10 MPa effective pressure with an ultrasonic pulse transmission technique (1 MHz). The data set was {{compared with an}} extensive database of petrophysical measurements {{of a variety of}} rock types encountered in carbonate sedimentary sequences. Two major textural groups were distinguished on the basis of trends in plots of compressional-wave velocity versus Poisson's ratio (a specific ratio of P-wave over S-wave velocity). In granular rocks, the framework of depositional grains is the main medium for acoustic-wave propagation; in crystalline rocks, this medium is provided by a framework of interlocking crystals formed during diagenesis. Rock textures are connected to primary depositional parameters and a diagenetic overprint through the specific effects on Poisson's ratio. Calculating acoustic velocities using Gassmann fluid substitution modeling approximates measured saturated velocities for 55 % of the samples (3 % error tolerance); however, it shows considerable <b>errors</b> because shear <b>modulus</b> changes with saturation. Introducing brine into the pore space may decrease the shear modulus of the rock by approximately 1. 4 GPa or, alternatively, increase it by approximately 1. 4 GPa. This change in shear modulus is coupled with the texture of the rock. In granular carbonates, the shear modulus decreases; in crystalline and cemented carbonates, it increases with saturation. The results demonstrate the intimate relationship between elastic behavior and the depositional and diagenetic properties of carbonate sedimentary rocks. The results potentially allow the direct extraction of granular and crystalline rock texture from acoustic data alone and may help predict rock types from seismic data and in wells. © 2008 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This study focused on the reduced platen compression (RPC) test of cancellous bone in the rodent proximal tibia. The objective was to improve methods for this mechanical test, specifically in the areas of specimen location, specimen preparation, and platen sizing. Analytical studies were utilized to assess the effect of platen size and shape on the resultant values obtained for elastic modulus of cancellous bone induced by compression. RPC specimens are made from transverse slices of the proximal tibial metaphysis. The specimen location was determined using radiographic methods in which the distance from the proximal end of the bone to the distal extent of the growth plate was measured. Using this distance, 2 -mm thick specimens were cut from the metaphysis and then platen sized for testing. Three platen sizing methods, which were based on various imaging methods, were studied. The cancellous bone was then tested under compression to failure. Three-dimensional finite element models of the specimens under the loading scenario were created with the ANSYS package. The models incorporated specimen geometry in the cross-sectional plane and through the thickness of the sample. The models were used to conduct parametric studies of the effects of platen size and shape on the percent <b>error</b> in elastic <b>modulus</b> as determined by the reduced platen compression test. Based on this study, several improvements to the reduced platen compression test were recommended. An improved method for specimen location was developed, however, it requires a corrective distance to account for the tissue not present in the radiograph analysis. The specimen preparation included minor changes like gripping fixtures, to ensure precise cuts. In platen sizing, {{it was found that the}} best-fit endocortical circle method is best suited for the proximal tibia compared with previous methods. The finite element models of the RPC specimen provided support for the use of an anatomically shaped platen in experiments and a foundation for further study. Recommendations for future study include using advanced technology like rapid prototyping, and custom shaped platens to enhance RPC testing...|$|R
