5|$|<b>Draught</b> <b>beer</b> from a {{pressurised}} keg using a lever-style dispenser and a spout is {{the most}} common method of dispensing in bars around the world. A metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide (CO2) gas which drives the beer to the dispensing tap or faucet. Some beers may be served with a nitrogen/carbon dioxide mixture. Nitrogen produces fine bubbles, resulting in a dense head and a creamy mouthfeel. Some types of beer can also be found in smaller, disposable kegs called beer balls. In traditional pubs, the pull levers for major beer brands may include the beer's logo and trademark.|$|E
5|$|Draught beer's {{environmental}} impact can be 68% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences. A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, {{shows that the}} CO2 emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer {{is estimated to be}} 2.5 square metres (26 square feet). Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage and disposal of waste can be over 45% of a bottled micro-brew beer's CO2 emissions. Where legal, the use of a refillable jug, reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport <b>draught</b> <b>beer</b> from a store or a bar, rather than buying pre-bottled beer, can reduce the {{environmental impact}} of beer consumption.|$|E
5|$|By 1980 all {{apart from}} the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland had {{effectively}} completed their programs. In the United Kingdom the breakdown of voluntary metrication in the mid-1970s coincided with the United Kingdom's obligations {{as part of the}} EEC to adopt the metric system, resulting in legislation to force metrication in certain areas and the Eurosceptic movement adopting an anti-metrication stance and the United Kingdom seeking a number of derogations from the relevant EEC directives. Once the metrication of most consumer goods was completed in 2000, aspects of British life, especially in government, commerce and industry used SI. Although imperial units are widely encountered in unregulated areas such as the press and everyday speech, SI or units approved for use alongside SI are used in most areas where units of measure are regulated. High-profile exceptions include the sale of <b>draught</b> <b>beer,</b> the sale of milk in returnable containers, and United Kingdom road signs. Irish road signs (road distances and speeds) were converted to metric units during {{the first decade of the}} 21st century; otherwise, the situation in Ireland is similar to that in the United Kingdom.|$|E

50|$|With the {{exception}} of TSB, the <b>draught</b> <b>beers</b> are filtered, kegged and served under pressure.|$|R
25|$|The United Kingdom avoided {{having to}} comply with the 1989 European Units of Measurement Directive (89/617/EEC), which {{required}} all member states to make the metric system compulsory, by negotiating derogations (delayed switchovers), including for miles on road signs and for pints for <b>draught</b> <b>beer,</b> cider, and milk sales.|$|E
25|$|As one of {{the most}} {{recognisable}} Guinness advertisements of the 1990s, Anticipation has been mimicked or parodied in a number of more recent Guinness campaigns, including the Irish Waiting spot in 2004 promoting cans of Guinness <b>draught</b> <b>beer,</b> and director JJ Keith's British Eskimo commercial, which was part of an extended campaign promoting Guinness Extra Cold in summer 2004 and 2005.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally <b>draught</b> <b>beer</b> {{came from}} wooden barrels, also called casks. In the 1950s these {{began to be}} {{replaced}} by metal casks of stainless steel or aluminium, mainly for quality reasons as they could be sterilised and the beer was therefore less likely to spoil, but also for economic reasons. An additional benefit of the switch to metal casks was that staling from oxygen in the air could be reduced. Subsequently, in the early 1960s a form of metal cask, known as a keg, was introduced which allowed for more efficient cleaning and filling in the brewery.|$|E

25|$|It is {{said that}} the Francesinha was invented in the 1960s. Daniel da Silva, a {{returned}} emigrant from France and Belgium, tried to adapt the croque-monsieur to Portuguese taste. Other versions date the Francesinha to the 19th century. It is a very popular dish in Porto and {{is associated with the}} city, although it can be sometimes found elsewhere in Portugal. A classic francesinha meal would include the sandwich, surrounded on a bed of chips doused in the famous , and complemented with a fino, literally meaning thin or fine, which in this context refers to <b>draught</b> <b>beer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The United Kingdom {{completed}} its official partial {{transition to the}} metric system in 1995, with some imperial units still legally mandated for certain applications such as <b>draught</b> <b>beer</b> and cider, road-signs, and therefore the speedometers on vehicles sold in the UK must be capable of displaying miles per hour. Even though the troy pound was outlawed in the UK in the Weights and Measures Act of 1878, the troy ounce may still {{be used for the}} weights of precious stones and metals. The original railways (many built in the Victorian era) are a big user of imperial units, with distances officially measured in miles and yards or miles and chains, and also feet and inches, and speeds are in miles per hour, although more recent systems are metric, and London Underground uses metric.|$|E
25|$|Metrication in the United Kingdom {{began in}} the mid-1960s. Initially this {{metrication}} was voluntary and by 1985 many traditional and imperial units of measure had been voluntarily removed from use in the retail trade. The Weights and Measures Act of 1985 formalized their removal for use in trade, though imperial units were retained for use on road signs and the most common imperial weights such as the foot, inch, pound, ounce, gallon and pint continued {{to be used in}} the retail trade for the sale of loose goods or goods measured or weighed in front of the customer. Since 1 January 2000 it has been unlawful to use imperial units for weights and measures in retail trade in the United Kingdom except as supplementary units or for the sale of <b>draught</b> <b>beer</b> and cider by the pint or milk that is sold in returnable containers.|$|E

Aluminium concentrations of the bottled, canned and <b>draught</b> <b>beers</b> varied so slightly that an examination of statistically significant differences of the aluminium contents was dispensed with.|$|R

25|$|The European Union {{used the}} Units of Measure Directive {{to attempt to}} achieve a common system of weights and {{measures}} and to facilitate the European Single Market. Throughout the 1990s, the European Commission helped accelerate the process for member countries to complete their metric conversion processes. Among them is the United Kingdom where laws in some or all contexts mandate or permit many imperial measures, such as miles and yards for road-sign distances, road speed limits in miles per hour, pints of beer, and inches for clothes. The United Kingdom secured permanent exemptions for the mile and yard in road markings, and (with Ireland) for the pint (Imperial) of <b>draught</b> <b>beer</b> sold in pubs (see Metrication in the United Kingdom). In 2007, the European Commission also announced that (to appease British public opinion and to facilitate trade with the United States) it was to abandon the requirement for metric-only labelling on packaged goods, and to allow dual metric–imperial marking to continue indefinitely.|$|E
500|$|... noitulovE {{was well}} {{received}} by critics within the advertising and television industries, and was predicted {{to win the}} 2006 Cannes Lions Film Grand Prix, one of the advertising industry's highest awards. Advertising Age said of the piece: [...] "A flawless DGI production to an irresistible piece of music propelling a brilliant, astonishingly witty new iteration of a longstanding, unique positioning. This isn't just great advertising; it is perfect advertising." [...] Gastón Bigio, Executive Creative Director for Del Campo Nazca Saatchi & Saatchi remarked on the campaign {{in the run-up to}} the festival, saying [...] "noitulovE is, in my opinion, the best. [...] This execution is absolutely incredible, as is the production."

After the three received Gold Lions in the Film category, they were shortlisted by the judges as contenders for the Grand Prix. Ultimately, the honour went to noitulovE.

A lot of the jurors felt that it was not only a stand-alone, remarkable ad, but also a triumphant return for a fabulous campaign."
