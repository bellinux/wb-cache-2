5000|$|Many methods may be {{employed}} to mitigate or prevent {{the damage caused by}} expansive soils. When it comes to foundations, one solution is to extend building foundations to a depth where they are below the zone of water content fluctuation. This supports them when the soil shrinks, and anchors them when the soil swells. Another solution is to remove the pre-existing <b>expansive</b> <b>soil</b> {{and replace it with a}} non-expansive soil, but if the depth of the <b>expansive</b> <b>soil</b> is too deep, this option is very expensive. Maintaining a constant soil moisture is another solution, which sometimes may be achieved by allowing rainwater to properly drain away from the property, fixing areas around structures that have poor drainage qualities, fixing pipe leaks, avoiding over-watering nearby plants, and by planting trees some distance away from any structure. Yet another solution is a process called soil stabilization, in which additional materials are added to the soil to limit its ability to shrink and swell. Materials for stabilization include cement, resins, fly ash, lime, pozzolana, or lime-pozzolana mixture, depending on the site conditions and the project goals.|$|E

40|$|<b>Expansive</b> <b>soils</b> {{generally}} pose {{a significant}} geological hazard, which causes damage to civil infrastructure that could amount to billions of rand every year. Traditionally, <b>expansive</b> <b>soils</b> have been mapped and characterized using {{methods such as}} X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and standard engineering tests such as Atterberg limits.

Notwithstanding the significance of remote sensing techniques and their applications in mapping <b>expansive</b> <b>soils,</b> research in this field is at its infancy in South Africa. The {{purpose of this study is}} to map <b>expansive</b> <b>soils</b> by use of multi-disciplinary techniques i. e., identify <b>expansive</b> <b>soils</b> using field observations, laboratory techniques and multispectral remote sensing. Soil samples (53) were collected from Brits in the North West Province. The soil samples were classified into swelling and non-swelling soils using laboratory-based techniques. In this regard, a) X-ray Diffraction (XRD) was used for mineralogical identification and classification, b) Atterberg limits tests were used to estimate swell potential of soils and support soil classification, and c) spectroscopic measurements of soil were acquired under laboratory conditions using a hand-held Analytical Spectral Device (ASD). Results show that <b>expansive</b> <b>soils</b> are dominant in the study area, with smectite being the most dominant clay mineral. Analysis of malleability demonstrated that soil plasticity varies from non-plastic to very high plasticity. Soils with medium to very high plasticity are in majority. Using an ASD that collects data in the 350 - 2500 nm wavelength region, swelling soils were identifiable in the SWIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Mean reflectance spectra of swelling and non-swelling soils were used to map these soils on ASTER imagery, using SAM classifier. In spite of the difficulties of acquiring enough ASTER images, mapping of <b>expansive</b> <b>soils</b> using remotely sensed imagery demonstrated potential of studying the distribution of <b>expansive</b> <b>soils</b> as well aid in geotechnical investigations with inherent spatial-temporal resolution merits.

Soils that experience swell/shrink problems in the UK are typically found in the south and east of the country, notably around London, corresponding to the drier parts of the UK.
