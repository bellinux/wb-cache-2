6000|$|... 'I {{dare say}} they're {{all right in}} their way, but with these foreigners you don't feel they're gentlemen. I don't know what it <b>is,</b> but <b>there's</b> <b>something,</b> <b>you</b> understand, don't you? And I do like {{a man to be}} a gentleman. I thank God I'm an Englishman!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Richard, <b>is,</b> <b>there</b> not <b>something</b> <b>you</b> can do?" [...] she cried, when, I had got {{her back}} in the little parlour in Gloucester Street; [...] "father has argued and, pleaded and {{threatened}} in vain. I thought,--I thought perhaps you might help him." ...|$|R
60|$|RICHARD. Because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> in <b>you</b> that I respect, {{and that}} makes me desire to have you for my enemy.|$|R
6000|$|... "In a moment, father. It's so {{fascinating}} to watch these country {{people with their}} baskets. Look! <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> can't beat in New York, anyhow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{sounds more}} like the school of Wetmore. That's what you say, Alma. Well, if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> wished me to be, I could be it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Elsie was {{genuinely}} amused. [...] "What {{is the meaning}} of this fervor. Has <b>there</b> <b>been</b> <b>something</b> between <b>you</b> and Captain Maynard in the past?" ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. [Taken aback for {{a moment}} by the {{finality}} of her tone, suddenly fronts MALISE] Then <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> between <b>you</b> and this fellow.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> else <b>you</b> are wishing for, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> not? I fancy every {{officer and}} {{man in the}} {{regiment}} is wishing for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her for a moment. [...] "That will not be necessary," [...] he said. [...] "But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> can do. Have you a pistol?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eugène," [...] she expostulated, [...] "we are too {{old friends}} to talk always in veiled phrases. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> {{have to say}} to me. I am listening." ...|$|R
60|$|CONFUCIUS. I forgot. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> for <b>you</b> {{to do this}} morning. You {{have to go to}} the Record Office {{to receive}} the American barbarian.|$|R
60|$|DEARTH. Oh, you. He made {{no bones}} about it; said <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> about <b>you</b> that made him want uncommonly to have you down here.|$|R
6000|$|... "Billy, you're dearer {{to me than}} {{anything}} else in the world. You know that. We're sharing each other's lives, only, just now, <b>there's</b> <b>something</b> you're not sharing. Every time your knuckles <b>are</b> sore, <b>there's</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> don't share. If you can't trust me, you can't trust anybody. And, besides, I love you so that {{no matter what you do}} I'll go on loving you just the same." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You told me <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> wished me to do, and, {{though it}} was difficult, it is done," [...] she said. [...] "My holding will be sown with wheat this spring." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will do it}} gladly, Terence; faith, it is {{a comfort}} to find that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> can't do." [...] And so, with much {{laughter}} and fun, the meal was eaten.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a {{good deal}} in that, as you say,' Logan admitted. 'But decent people will think the whole {{speculation}} shady. How are you to get round that? <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> have forgotten.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you wish}} to puzzle me? Do you know her? But, in truth, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something.</b> Again <b>you</b> are pale as that statue. Rely on Paul Carlos; tell him the grief." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it can't {{be as bad}} as all that!" [...] cried Columbine. [...] "Oh, I knew--I knew <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something....</b> Ben, <b>you</b> mean even at best now--he'll be a--" [...] She broke off, {{unable to}} finish.|$|R

6000|$|... "All {{the money}} {{which has been}} taken this morning is in the drawer, and unless <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> more <b>you</b> {{want to say to}} me I will go, as I made an {{engagement}} down town for ten o'clock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> more <b>you</b> would like, Francisco. Remember that I {{have told}} you that I regard you as a son, and {{therefore}} I wish you to speak to me, as frankly as if I was really your father." ...|$|R
5000|$|Theresa May {{has stated}} her regret that, for health reasons, she and Philip {{have not been}} able to have children; she said in one {{interview}} that, [...] "You look at families all the time and <b>you</b> see <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>there</b> that <b>you</b> don't have".|$|R
6000|$|... "Scold me, dear," [...] said Mrs. Davilow, her {{delicate}} worn face flushing with delight. [...] "But I wish <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> could eat after your ride--instead of these scraps. Let Jocosa {{make you a}} cup of chocolate in your old way. You used to like that." ...|$|R
60|$|CRICHTON (wondering {{a little}} at himself for saying it). I won't give you up. It is strange that one so common should attract one so fastidious; but so it <b>is.</b> (Thoughtfully.) <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> about <b>you,</b> Tweeny, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a je ne sais quoi about you.|$|R
50|$|If {{you try to}} {{encourage}} more openness, and at first others are unresponsive or hesitant to participate, consider asking someone you trust after the meeting if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that <b>you</b> might have missed or could have done differently to achieve the desired result".|$|R
6000|$|... "He wrote, you know, {{and said}} that he had been staying with the Deloras on their estate, and he begged that I should call upon your uncle here. Now I have had a cable from him. Felicia, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> wrong. <b>You</b> shall read the cable for yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a word. Indeed {{it was not}} I {{who told}} papa. It was Peter. Peter said that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> between <b>you</b> and him, and papa asked me. I told papa {{that he was in}} love with you. That was true at any rate. You won't deny that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She knows, too, that he {{does not}} know it?" [...] This {{question}} Cecilia answered only by some sign. [...] "I fancied that it might be so. I thought that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> between <b>you</b> which had been kept from him. Why, why have you been,--shall I say so foolish?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{judge was}} looking at Father Brown with level and {{piercing}} eyes. [...] "You are a most extraordinary witness," [...] he said; [...] "but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> about <b>you</b> that makes me think {{you are trying to}} tell the truth. Well, who was the man you saw in the passage?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> {{can do for}} us. We want to fill up our {{cart with}} the sort of stuff you take to market--apples and pumpkins, and things of that sort. If we had gone to buy them {{anywhere}} else, <b>there</b> might have <b>been</b> questions asked. From what the doctor said you can let us have some." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are such}} a strange person," [...] she murmured. [...] "You aren't {{a little bit like}} any of the men I've ever known, any of the men I have ever cared to have as friends. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> about <b>you</b> {{altogether}} different.
