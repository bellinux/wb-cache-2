Result {{of a study}} {{as reported by the}} Directorate General of Communicable Disease Control, Ministry of Health, indicated that the poisoning are frequently caused by sea fish especially <b>tuna</b> fish (<b>Auxis</b> <b>thazard).</b> That's why Health Ecology Research Centre has done another research to find a safe way how to cook sea fish especially tuna fish for safe consumption. This research was conducted from June 1997 until March 1998. The samples consisted of <b>tuna</b> fish (<b>Auxis</b> <b>thazard)</b> and kembung fish (Rastrelliger spp) bought from Fish Auction in Cilincing and Cilincing market. The fishes were carried in an ice box to be analized in the laboratory and prepared in different cooking methods: fresh steamedfish, fish cooked in coconut milk, fried fish and grilled fish. Measurement of histamine levels were done by the Mopper Method and observation of microflora for fungi and bacteria, to know wich way of cooking fish was related to the lowest histamine level. By analizing histamine level it was found that fresh steamed fish contained the lowest histamine (tuna 6, 34 ppm, kembung 3, 91 ppm),fish cooked in coconut milk (tuna 8, 11 ppm, kembung 5, 20 ppm), fried fish (tuna 14, 86 ppm, kembung 13, 18 ppm) and grilled fish (tuna 31, 12 ppm, kembung 19, 49 ppm). It has been proven that the histamine level of cooked fresh fish is less than 50 ppm (US Food and Drug Administration/FDA s, allowable concentration). The conclusion of this research : to cook fresh fish is the best and that fish must be handled carefully. The rotary histamin content was lowest in fresh steamed fish, followed by fish cooked in coconut milk, fried fish and grilled fish. The kinds of fungi found were : Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus ochraceus, Khamir and Rhizopus sp. In the cooked fish we did not find any pathogenic bacteria. </p...|$|R

By mid 1980 s the purpose-built second generation vessels that replaced the converted sailing vessels increased the catch by threefold. However, further rapid increase in catch was slow until late 1990 s with third generation fibreglass (FRP) vessels joining the fleet. Catches then doubled from 1996 to 2006. Private sector investments in post-harvest sector are driving the most recent phase of fishery expansion. These include the additional collection and storage facilities, tuna canneries and the rapidly growing fresh tuna export business.

Studies on fish behavior using Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) are good complement where data is limited. A study using semi-structured interview (n = 46) and three focus group discussions (n = 39 participants) to record fishers' knowledge and observations on the behavior of different fish species around anchored FADs was conducted. This particularly focused on attraction, retention, and departure behavior of fishes in identified FAD sites. Based on the fishers' knowledge, tuna schools are attracted to anchored FADs at 10 km distance. In anchored FADs, tuna form schools segregated by species and size. There was no relationship between the attraction distance and the reported school size and the various waiting times for fish to aggregate below the FADs. There was no variation between the species present at day or night time although fishers have reported a distinction of species found near the surface (0 - 10 m) and those found at other depths (11 - 20 m).

In this experiment, <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> were divided into 3 groups, group 1 was soaked for 30 minutes in water, group 2 soaked for 30 minutes in a solution of ethyl acetate extract of leaf jatropha with a concentration of 1 %, and group 3 was soaked for 30 minutes in a solution of methanol extract of leaf jatropha with a concentration of 1 %. After that, <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> stored {{at room temperature for}} 5 hours, then analyzed the number of bacterial colony with total plate count method (TPC), number of histamine-forming bacteria and histamine levels. The results showed that the value of TPC the <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> its soaked in water are log 6. 68 (cfu / g), soaked in a solution of ethyl acetate extract are log 4. 94 (cfu / g) and soaked in a solution of methanol extract are log 5. 61 (cfu / g). The number of histamine-forming bacteria in the <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> its soaked in water are log 5. 62 (cfu / g), soaked in a solution of ethyl acetate extract are log 4. 40 (cfu / g) and soaked in a solution of methanol extract are log 5. 54 (cfu / g). histamine levels of the <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> its soaked in water are 17. 73 mg / kg, soaked in a solution of ethyl acetate extract are 11. 07 mg / kg and soaked in a solution of methanol extract are 14. 02 mg / kg. Thus, the ethyl acetate extract of leaves of Jatropha is more effective to inhibiting the growth of histamine-forming bacteria and inhibit the formation of histamine in fresh <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> that stored for 5 hours at room temperature...|$|R
40|$|Both <b>Auxis</b> <b>thazard</b> and A. rochet appear {{almost always}} in mixed schools and rarely as {{independent}} schools, in the Ceylon waters. The relative {{proportion of the}} two species, entering the fishery each year, is dependent more on the size compositions of these species and of the other species in the mixed schools than on area or season. Seasonal and annual variations in the catch rate of those species are discussed. The relative densities of distribution of the frigate mackeiels around Ceylon are given. Size and season of entry of these species into the troll and driftnet fisheries have also been determined. Selectivity of {{the different types of}} geais used in Ceylon waters is also discussed in relation to these two species...|$|R
40|$|Potential {{fishing ground}} mapping of {{skipjack}} and <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> was determined based on sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration. The objectives of study were {{to analyze the}} temporal and spatial variability of SST and chlorophyll-a and it 2 ̆ 7 s relationship on potential fishing ground. Chlorophyll-a concentration and SST were derived from Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors using SeaDAS image processing software. Catch data of skipjack and <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna</b> collected from Lampulo fishing base, Banda Aceh from January 2006 until November 2007. Linier regression was used to analysis relationship between catch Perunit effort (CPUE) of fish and oceanographic parameters. The analysis of SST and chlorophyll-a concentration showed the temporal and spatial variations in northern part of Aceh seawaters. Both of Chlorophyll-a concentration and SST have positive relationship on CPUE of skipjack and <b>frigate</b> <b>tuna...</b>|$|R
40|$|Dr. J. F. Aldrin, Sous Direction de Pêche, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, {{during an}} {{extensive}} survey of tropical Atlantic Tunnies, discovered {{the presence of}} Cyclopoid Copepods of the family Bomolochidae in the nasal fossae of three species of tunnies, viz., Euthynnus alleteratus (Rafinesque), <b>Auxis</b> <b>thazard</b> (Lacépède) and Sarda sarda (Bloch). The material was placed into my hands for study by mediation of Dr. R. Repelin, Director, Centre de Recherches Océanographiques, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. The material from Euthynnus alleteratus and <b>Auxis</b> <b>thazard</b> has been described below. From Sarda sarda I have sofar seen only two male specimens, that I cannot possibly distinguish from the males {{of one of the}} species observed in Euthynnus alleteratus. I will await the discovery of female specimens in the nasal fossae of Sarda sarda before dealing with the material from this host. I want to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. R. Repelin and Dr. J. F. Aldrin for kindly supplying me with this interesting material. Parabomolochus anonymus nov. spec. (fig. 1 - 6) Material examined. — Gulf of Guinea, off Abidjan, Côte d'lvoire, leg. Dr. J. F. Aldrin, 12 adult, partly ovigerous females from the nasal fossae of Euthynnus alleteratus (Rafinesque) (type host). An ovigerous female of 932 μ length has been selected the holotype; the drawings of the external appearance have been taken from this specimen. The remaining females vary in length between 1000 and 1150 μ and have been labelled as paratypes. One of the paratypes, a non-ovigerous female of 1030 μ length, has been dissected and the appendages mounted. All specimens and the slides are in the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie, Leiden, the Netherlands. Description. — Adult female, total length 932 μ. The greatest diameter o...|$|R
