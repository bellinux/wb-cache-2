40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} the subcellular metabolite levels in spinach protoplasts is described. The protoplasts are disrupted by centrifugation through a nylon net, releasing intact chloroplasts which pass through a layer of silicone oil into perchloric acid while the remaining cytoplasmic components remain over the oil and are simultaneously quenched as acid is centrifuged into them. Cross-contamination is measured and corrected for using ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate as a chloroplastic marker and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase as a cytoplasmic marker. A method for separation of intact protoplasts from the medium by silicone oil centrifugation is described, which allows a correction {{to be made for}} the effect of free chloroplasts and broken protoplasts. Methods for inhibiting chloroplast photosynthesis, without inhibiting protoplasts, are presented. It is demonstrated that ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate, ATP, ADP, AMP, inorganic phosphate, hexose phosphate, triose phosphate, fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate, and 3 -phosphoglycerate can be reliably recovered in the subcellular fractions isolated from protoplasts, and measured by <b>enzymic</b> substrate <b>analysis...</b>|$|R

In addition, analysis of the mitochondria by sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed no differences between control tissue and liver from patients with alcoholic liver disease. These results do not indicate that there is significant mitochondrial damage in ALD. The raised mitochondrial matrix enzymes may represent an adaptive response to the ethanol load...|$|E

The polysaccharide was homogeneous by ultracentrifugal analysis and gel filtration on Sepharose CL- 6 B, molecular weight 330, 000. The structure of pea xyloglucan was examined by fragmentation <b>analysis</b> of <b>enzymic</b> hydrolysates, methylation <b>analysis,</b> and precipitation tests with fucose- or galactose-binding lectins. The polysaccharide was composed of equal amounts of two subunits, a nonasaccharide (glucose/xylose/galactose/fucose, 4 : 3 : 1 : 1) and a heptasaccharide (glucose/xylose, 4 : 3), which appeared to be distributed at random, but primarily in alternating sequence. The xyloglucan:cellulose complex was examined by light microscopy using iodine staining, by radioautography after labeling with [3 H]fucose, by fluorescence microscopy using a fluorescein-lectin (fucose-binding) as probe, and by electron microscopy after shadowing. The techniques all demonstrated that the macromolecule was present in files of cell shapes, referred to here as cell-wall `ghosts,' in which xyloglucan was localized both on and between the cellulose microfibrils. Since the average chain length of pea xyloglucan was many times the diameter of cellulose microfibrils, it could introduce cross-links by binding to adjacent fibrils and thereby contribute rigidity to the wall...|$|R

40|$|Seventeen {{patients}} with intractable sciatica due to prolapse of a lumbar disc, treated by intradiscal injection of chymopapain (chemonucleolysis) were studied.

This was not detected in four patients undergoing routine discography. <b>Enzymic</b> <b>analysis</b> of urinary glycosaminoglycan after chemonucleolysis suggested that the increase in levels was largely due to an increase in the amounts of chondroitin sulphate present, probably resulting from proteoglycan breakdown in the intervertebral disc. Eight of the patients treated by chemonucleolysis underwent serial computed tomography (CT). One month after the injection the only change seen was a loss of definition of the disc prolapse, which could be interpreted as a loss of turgidity in the disc as a result of proteoglycan breakdown by chymopapain. By six months the CT of those patients whose symptoms had improved showed that the degree of disc prolapse was usually less marked and the disc margin more clearly defined, suggesting that by this stage anatomical remodelling had occurred...|$|E
40|$|Two {{membrane}} {{preparation containing}} glucan synthase activity {{were obtained by}} lysis of regenerating sphaeroplasts (enzyme A) or mechanical breakage (enzyme B) of yeast (Candida albicans) cells. The reaction products of both enzymes (glucans A and B respectively) were characterized as linear beta- 1, 3 -linked glucans {{on the basis of}} chemical and <b>enzymic</b> <b>analysis.</b> In addition, two pools of glucan could be distinguished in glucan A preparations {{on the basis of their}} susceptibility to an exoglucanase.

At least some of the performed chains of glucan A, but not those of glucan B, showed a free reducing terminal. Glucan A preparations were endowed with endoglucanase activity, which, under appropriate conditions, released glucose, laminaribiose and laminaritriose. These sugars were also found in cell-wall autolysates. On the basis of the origin of both enzyme preparations it is suggested that glucan molecules are synthesized while they are bound to a non-glucan acceptor that is subsequently excised, presumably by cell-wall-associated glucanases...|$|E
40|$|The type, {{amount and}} fine {{chemical}} composition of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) present both in human normal myometrium and uterine leiomyoma have been studied. GAGs were fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, isolated by gel-permeation chromatography on Sepharose CL- 6 B and characterized using electrophoresis in cellulose acetate membranes, specific <b>enzymic</b> treatments and <b>analysis</b> by high-performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE). No statistical intrabatch differences in total GAG content in both tissues were identified, whereas significant interbatch differences between normal myometrium and uterine leiomyoma were recorded. Hyaluronan (HA), chondroitin sulphate (CS), dermatan sulphate (DS), heparan sulphate (HS) and keratan sulphate (KS) {{were identified in}} both tissues. Statistically significant (P {{less than or equal}} to 0. 001) differences in uterine leiomyoma in the content of HA (- 27. 7 %), DS (+ 158. 5 %), KS (+ 116. 4 %) and HS (- 52. 5 %), as compared to normal myometrium, were determined. Despite the differences in the amount of GAGs, no significant differences in the fine chemical composition of CS and DS were identified. It is worth noting that DS of both tissues is constructed by glucuronic acid-containing long repeats separated by a few iduronic acid residues. The results of this study suggest that the development of uterine leiomyoma is closely related to quantitative changes at the GAG level. The increase of DS and KS may well be related to increased neosynthesis of fibrotic connective tissue, whereas the decrease of HA and the unaltered amounts of CS may also indicate benign tumors of low growth rate.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of Na+, alpha-aminoisobutyrate was transported by saturable and non-saturable processes into R 3230 AC mammary tumour cells isolated by <b>enzymic</b> treatment. Eadie-Hofstee <b>analysis</b> for the saturable process gave a curvilinear plot, suggesting that transport occurred {{by more than one}} carrier. In the absence of Na+, alpha-aminoisobutyrate was also transported by both saturable and non-saturable processes. This Na+-independent saturable process gave a linear plot according to Eadie-Hofstee analysis: V, 708 +/- 105 pmol/min per 5 X 10 (6) cells; Km, 0. 36 +/- 0. 33 mM (mean +/- S. E. M.). Subtracting alpha-aminoisobutyrate entry in the absence of Na+ from total alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake (in {{the presence}} of Na+) showed {{the presence of}} another saturable process (Na+-dependent), accounting for 75 % of total alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake. This component gave a linear Eadie-Hofstee plot: V, 2086 +/- 213; Km, 1. 75 +/- 0. 16 alpha-(Methylamino) isobutyrate, a substrate specifically taken up by the A system, inhibited 80 % of alpha-aminoisobutyrate entry. The presence of both alhpa-(methylamino) isobutyrate and phenylalanine inhibited alpha-aminoisobutyrate entry completely. 2 -Aminobicyclo[2. 2. 1]heptane- 2 -carboxylate, an analogue specifically taken up by the Na+-independent system, inhibited completely the Na+-independent entry of alpha-aminoisobutyrate. In the presence of Na+, the distribution ratio, which is defined as the amino acid concentration in the intracellular space divided by that in the incubation medium for alpha-aminoisobutyrate, at 90 min was 19, {{and in the absence of}} Na+ at 60 min was 5. These concentrative processes were sensitive to the metabolic inhibitor pentachlorophenol. The Na+-dependent, but not the Na+-independent, alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake was increased in cells from diabetic rats. This was primarily due to an increase in the V for the Na+-dependent component (164 %) with no effect on the Km. We conclude, therefore, that alpha-aminoisobutyrate entry into cells from this mammary tumour is mediated by two transport systems, one Na+-dependent and another Na+-independent. Furthermore, the Na+-dependent component of alpha-aminoisobutyrate is sensitive to alterations of insulin in vivo...|$|R

MCII mast cells (a factor-dependent bone-marrow-derived murine mast cell line) produce significant amounts of leukotriene C 4 (LTC 4) (70 ng/ 10 (6) cells) on cross-linking of Fc epsilon RI. Using <b>enzymic</b> and immunochemical <b>analysis</b> we found that cPLA 2 is the predominant form of this enzyme in MCII mast cells (0. 2 micrograms/mg of total protein) and other forms (i. e. secretory PLA 2 or Ca 2 + independent cytosolic PLA 2) could not be detected. Therefore MCII mast cells represent an excellent cellular model {{for the study of}} the biochemical mechanism(s) responsible for Fc epsilon RI-induced activation of cPLA 2 and the involvement of cPLA 2 in Fc epsilon RI-mediated production of LTC 4. After activation of Fc epsilon RI by cross-linking, cPLA 2 in MCII mast cells exhibited a decreased electrophoretic mobility and its enzyme activity was increased 3 -fold. Treatment with phosphatase reversed both the altered electrophoretic mobility and the enhanced enzyme activity demonstrating that they were the result of Fc epsilon RI-induced phosphorylation. On cross-linking of Fc epsilon RI, cPLA 2 was phosphorylated within 30 s and appeared to be an early substrate for Fc epsilon RI-activated protein kinases in MCII mast cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation may be a critical component in this process, as genistein, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases, blocked the activation of cPLA 2. Using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies we observed that the activating phosphorylation was not on tyrosine residues of cPLA 2, indicating that tyrosine kinases participate upstream in the signalling cascade that couples Fc epsilon RI to cPLA 2. We conclude that in MCII mast cells cPLA 2 is activated by kinase-dependent mechanisms and may be responsible for Fc epsilon RI-induced mobilization of arachidonic acid for the generation of LTC 4...|$|R

Results of <b>enzymic</b> <b>analysis</b> provided here suggest that a previously defined deficiency of aspartase (AspA) accounts for this phenomenon rather than an elevated oxaloacetate pool. The only known distinction between most sequenced isolates of aspA from Y. pestis and the active gene in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (the immediate progenitor of Y. pestis) is a single base transversion (G?CAT?A) causing replacement of leucine (encoded by UUG) for valine (encoded by GUG) at amino acid position 363. The gene from Y. pestis KIM possesses a unique second transversion (G?CAT?A) at amino acid 146 causing substitution of aspartic acid (encoded by GAU) with tyrosine (encoded by UAU). We show in this study that Y. pestis expresses aspA as cross-reacting immunological material (CRIM). Functional and inactive aspA of Y. pseudotuberculosis PB 1 and Y. pestis KIM, respectively, were then cloned and expressed in AspA-deficient Escherichia coli.

In the absence of L-cysteine, hepatocytes produced oxalate from 2 mM glycollate {{at a rate of}} 822 +/- 42 nmol/ 30 min per 10 (7) cells. The addition of L-cysteine to the incubation medium at 1. 0, 2. 5 and 5. 0 mM lowered oxalate production by 14 +/- 2, 25 +/- 3 (P < 0. 05) and 38 +/- 3 % (P < 0. 01) respectively. These reductions were accompanied by almost stoichiometric increases in the levels of the adduct: 162 +/- 6, 264 +/- 27 and 363 +/- 30 nmol/ 30 min per 10 (7) cells. Adduct formation is therefore confirmed as the primary mechanism by which L-cysteine decreases oxalate production from glycollate.

To a lesser extent, ADPR underwent conversion into a compound that was identified as ADP-ribulose (ADPRu), on the basis of m. s., n. m. r. spectroscopy and <b>enzymic</b> <b>analysis.</b> ADPRu was also susceptible to degradation by the dinucleotide pyrophosphatase, which was partially purified from erythrocyte lysates and characterized with respect to its substrate specificity. Isomerization of ADPR to ADPRu was markedly enhanced by ATP. Incubation of unsealed haemoglobin-free erythrocyte membranes with labelled ADPR did not cause any transformation of this nucleotide and resulted in its trichloroacetic acid- and formic acid-resistant binding to a number of membrane cytoskeletal proteins. These proteins include spectrin, glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (Ga 3 PDH), three proteins of molecular masses 98, 79 and 72 kDa, which apparently comigrate with bands 3, 4. 1 and 4. 2 respectively, and two additional proteins of molecular masses 58 and 41 kDa. Acid-resistant binding of ADPR, as well as of NAD+, to Ga 3 PDH was confirmed for the enzyme purified from human erythrocytes...|$|E
40|$|The alpha subunit {{of human}} {{chorionic}} gonadotrophin was reduced with dithiothreitol followed by carboxymethylation with iodoacetic acid. The modified glycoprotein was hydrolysed with trypsin to give various peptides, {{the identities of}} which were established, and glycopeptides. The glycopeptides were separated by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography; they were subjected to component analysis and were found to represent the two carbohydrate moieties in the parent glycoprotein. Sequential removal with glycoside hydrolases of monosaccharide units from the glycopeptides demonstrated (1) that galactose, mannose, glucosamine (2 -amino- 2 -deoxyglucose) and neuraminic acid (5 -amino- 3, 5 -dideoxy-glycero-galacto- 2 -nonulosonic acid) residues possess the D configurations, (2) that the glucosamine units are N-acetylated and (3) {{the order of the}} monosaccharide units in the chain, the neuraminic acid units being furthest from the peptide backbone of the subunit and substituting the D-galactose units. Methylation analysis of the glycopeptides by adaptation of the Hakomori technique demonstrated that: (4) D-galactose, D-mannose and N-acetylglucosamine (2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose) units exist in the pyranose forms; (5) the D-galactopyranose units are linked in the 1 and 6 positions; (6) the D-mannopyranose units exist in several forms, one in a terminal non-reducing position, one as 1, 2 -linked residues and some as 1, 6 -linked branch points; (7) the N-acetylglucosamine units are 1, 6 -linked. On the basis of the results of methylation and <b>enzymic</b> <b>analysis,</b> structures are proposed for the carbohydrate moieties and the assignments are compared with other data previously obtained by periodate-oxidation studies [Kennedy et al. (1974) Carbohydr. Res. 36, 369 - 377]...|$|E
40|$|The blood-perfused choroid plexuses {{from the}} lateral ventricles {{of the sheep}} were used to {{determine}} the nature of sugar exchanges between blood and cerebrospinal fluid (c. s. f.). There was a net entry of sugars from blood to c. s. f. at all concentrations of sugars which were used and this net entry was seen when the sugars were measured either directly by <b>enzymic</b> <b>analysis</b> or by the use of isotopically labelled sugars. From competition experiments the order of affinity of the transporting system from both blood to c. s. f. and c. s. f. to blood was the same, i. e. 2 -deoxy-D-glucose much greater than D-glucose greater than 3 -O-methyl-D-glucose much greater than D-galactose. The transport of sugars from c. s. f. to blood and blood to c. s. f. consists in both cases of a non-saturable and a saturable component. However, the affinity of the two systems is markedly different, the blood to c. s. f. being a system of low affinity and high capacity while that of the c. s. f. to blood has a high affinity and a low capacity. The concentration of glucose in the newly formed c. s. f. was estimated from the rate of c. s. f. secretion and the net flux of glucose across the choroid plexus. The concentration of glucose in this fluid was some 45 - 60 % of that in plasma and so the low glucose concentration observed in bulk c. s. f. would appear to be a result of the entry process and not that of cerebral metabolism...|$|E
40|$|A mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. which lacks leaf starch was {{isolated}} by screening for plants {{which did not}} stain with iodine. The starchless phenotype, confirmed by quantitative <b>enzymic</b> <b>analysis,</b> {{is caused by a}} single recessive nuclear mutation which results in a deficiency of the chloroplast isozyme of phosphoglucomutase. When grown in a 12 -h photoperiod, leaves of the wild-type accumulated substantial amounts of starch but lower levels of soluble sugars. Under these conditions, the mutant accumulated relatively high levels of soluble sugars. Rates of growth and net photosynthesis of the mutant and wild-type were indistinguishable when the plants were grown in constant illumination. However, in a short photoperiod, the growth of the mutant was severely impaired, the rate of photosynthesis was depressed relative to the wild-type, and the rate of dark respiration, which was high following the onset of darkness, exhibited an uncharacteristic decay throughout the dark period. The altered control of respiration by the mutant, which {{may be related to the}} relatively high levels of soluble carbohydrate that accumulate in the leaf and stem tissue, is believed to be partially responsible for the low growth rate of the mutant in short days. The depressed photosynthetic capacity of the mutant may also reflect a metabolic adaptation to the accumulation of high levels of soluble carbohydrate which mimics the effects of alterations in source/sink ratio. The activities of sucrose phosphate synthase and acid invertase are significantly higher in the mutant than in the wild-type whereas ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity is lower. This suggests that the activities of these enzymes may be modulated in response to metabolite concentrations or flux through the pathways...|$|E
40|$|Chondroitinases {{are very}} {{important}} tools for the identification and structural analysis of proteoglycans. <b>Enzymic</b> <b>analysis</b> with Flavobacterium heparinum chondroitinases has shown that chondroitin sulphate and dermatan sulphate structures are modified in many human diseases, suggesting a diagnostic value for these enzymes. Furthermore, it was recently shown that F. heparinum chondroitinases AC and B inhibit tumoural cell growth, invasion and angiogenesis. Due to the increasing importance of F. heparinum chondroitinases, we investigated optimized conditions for preparation and assay of chondroitinases AC, B and C. the Dimethylmethylene Blue assay was modified and fully developed to measure the chondroitinase activities of crude extracts of F. heparinum. This method estimates chondroitin sulphate or dermatan sulphate depolymerization upon the digestion of chondroitinase, and was compared with A(232), which measures the unsaturated products formed. Trypticase was the best culture medium, both for bacterial growth and enzyme induction. the chondroitinases were solubilized by ultrasound under conditions that do not completely disrupt the cells, suggesting that they are located at the periplasmic space. Maximum chondroitinase induction occurred {{in the presence of}} 0. 2 - 1. 0 g/l chondroitin sulphate. Chondroitin sulphate-degraclation products were also inducers, but heparin and heparan sulphate were not. Chondroitinases AC, B and C were separated from each other by hydrophobic-interaction chromatography on Phenyl-Sepharose HP. When contaminant proteins were first removed from crude extract by Q-Sepharose, the chondroitinases could be purified to homogeneity in this phenyl-Sepharose chromatographic step.

40|$|The role of {{hexokinase}} in carbohydrate degradation in isolated, intact chloroplasts was evaluated. This {{was accomplished}} by monitoring the evolution of 14 CO 2 from darkened spinach (Spinacia oleracea), maize (Zea mays) mesophyll, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplasts externally supplied with 14 C-labeled fructose, glucose, mannose, galactose, maltose, and ribose. Glucose and ribose were the preferred substrates with the Chlamydomonas and maize chloroplasts, respectively. The rate of CO 2 release from fructose was about twice that from glucose in the spinach chloroplast. Externally supplied ATP stimulated the rate of CO 2 release. The pH optimum for CO 2 release was 7. 5 with ribose and fructose and 8. 5 with glucose as substrates. Probing the outer membrane polypeptides of the intact spinach chloroplast with two proteases, trypsin and thermolysin, decreased 14 CO 2 release from glucose about 50 % but had little effect when fructose was the substrate. Tryptic digestion decreased CO 2 release from glucose in the Chlamydomonas chloroplast about 70 %. 14 CO 2 evolution from [1 - 14 C]-glucose- 6 -phosphate in both chloroplasts was unaffected by treatment with trypsin. <b>Enzymic</b> <b>analysis</b> of the supernatant (stroma) of the lysed spinach chloroplast indicated a hexokinase active primarily with fructose but with some affinity for glucose. The pellet (membranal fraction) contained a hexokinase utilizing both glucose and fructose but with considerably less total activity than the stromal enzyme. Treatment with trypsin and thermolysin eliminated more than 50 % of the glucokinase activity but {{had little effect on}} fructokinase activity in the spinach chloroplast. Tryptic digestion of the Chlamydomonas chloroplast resulted in a loss of about 90 % of glucokinase activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which proglycosyn (LY 177, 507) stimulates glycogen synthesis in isolated hepatocytes [Harris, R. A., Yamanouchi, K., Roach, P. J., Yen, T. T., Dominiani, S. J. & Stephens, T. W. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 13674 - 13680] has been investigated. When incubated {{in the presence of}} hepatocytes, proglycosyn was metabolized to an O-demethylated glucuronidated derivative, as determined by fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry and <b>enzymic</b> <b>analysis.</b> This metabolite accumulated almost linearly inside the cells to reach a concentration of approximately 3 mumol/g protein after 50 min, without apparent release into the medium. In confirmation of previous work, proglycosyn decreased the level of phosphorylase a and increased that of synthase a in hepatocytes. Washing of cells incubated with proglycosyn for 30 min considerably decreased the concentration of the drug without significantly modifying the intracellular concentration of the metabolite and the activation state of glycogen synthase. Several compounds bearing structural analogy with proglycosyn were also tested for their effect on glycogen metabolism. At millimolar or submillimolar concentrations, resorcinol, m-anisidine, phenol, 3 -hydroxyacetophenone, and 3 -acetamidophenol, although not 4 -acetamidophenol, stimulated the incorporation of [14 C]glucose into glycogen, decreased the level of phosphorylase a and increased the level of synthase a. In the case of phenol, the effect on the glycogen enzymes paralleled the intracellular accumulation of phenylglucuronide. Furthermore, ethanol and D-galactosamine, which decreased the conversion of phenol to phenylglucuronide and the intracellular concentration of phenylglucuronide, counteracted the effect of phenol on the synthase and on the phosphorylase. From these results, it is suggested that the effect of proglycosyn and of simpler phenol derivatives is mediated by glucuronidated metabolites, which act on an intracellular target...|$|E
40|$|In bakers' yeast, an {{immediate}} alcoholic fermentation begins when a glucose pulse {{is added to}} glucose-limited, aerobically grown cells. The mechanism of this short-term Crabtree effect was investigated via a comparative <b>enzymic</b> <b>analysis</b> of eight yeast species. It was established that the fermentation rate of the organisms upon transition from glucose limitation to glucose excess is positively correlated {{with the level of}} pyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4. 1. 1. 1). In the Crabtree-negative yeasts, the pyruvate decarboxylase activity was low and did not increase when excess glucose was added. In contrast, in the Crabtree-positive yeasts, the activity of this enzyme was on the average sixfold higher and increased after exposure to glucose excess. In Crabtree-negative species, relatively high activities of acetaldehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1. 2. 1. 4 and EC 1. 2. 1. 5) and acetyl coenzyme A synthetase (EC 6. 2. 1. 1), in addition to low pyruvate decarboxylase activities, were present. Thus, in these yeasts, acetaldehyde can be effectively oxidized via a bypass that circumvents the reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol. Growth rates of most Crabtree-positive yeasts did not increase upon transition from glucose limitation to glucose excess. In contrast, the Crabtree-negative yeasts exhibited enhanced rates of biomass production which in most cases could be ascribed to the intracellular accumulation of reserve carbohydrates. Generally, the glucose consumption rate after a glucose pulse was higher in the Crabtree-positive yeasts than in the Crabtree-negative yeasts. However, the respiratory capacities of steady-state cultures of Crabtree-positive yeasts were not significantly different from those of Crabtree-negative yeasts. Thus, a limited respiratory capacity is not the primary cause of the Crabtree effect in yeasts. Instead, the difference between Crabtree-positive and Crabtree-negative yeasts is attributed to differences in the kinetics of glucose uptake, synthesis of reserve carbohydrates, and pyruvate metabolism...|$|E
