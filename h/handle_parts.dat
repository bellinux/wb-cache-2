40|$|AbstractRobot {{grippers}} {{are employed}} to <b>handle</b> <b>parts</b> in automated assembly operations. In conventional foundry assembly, such grippers {{are dedicated to}} large volume production of standard parts. However, due to varying customer preferences {{in the recent years}} of increased global competition, the foundry industry needs to cope with rapid market changes by increasingly relying on flexible automated assembly lines which are capable of handling a wide variety of parts in small to medium volume and variety. These flexible automated lines require flexible grippers to <b>handle</b> <b>parts</b> which are otherwise not safe to be handled by human operators. This paper discusses various handling methods for hazardous foundry parts. The paper presents an extensive literature review for handling such cast parts and sand cores and their respective shortcomings dependent on the delivery methods.

30|$|In {{terms of}} the handle length l, a longer handle length {{contributes}} to less deformation along the Y direction, and the curvature has a local maximum when l is approximately 5 mm. For the fixation angle ϕ, a larger fixation angle contributes to larger curvature during deformation and does not affect deformation in the Y direction. Shorter fixation distance L' between the <b>handle</b> <b>parts</b> transfers the circular arc deformation along the Y direction. From {{the nature of this}} mechanism, the fixation parts must be placed closer to the face than the nob attach to the eyelid, and it is more difficult to attach the nob to the eyelid when deformation in the Y direction is larger. The fixation parts and the ELGM deformation loci must be closer in order to maintain contact with the eyelid. In this case, from the results of this deformation analysis and exploratory prototyping, we prepare a prototype with l = 5 mm, ϕ = 50 °, and L' = 38 mm for use in the following experiments.|$|E

40|$|Industrial robots, due {{to their}} great speed, {{precision}} and cost‐effectiveness in repetitive tasks, now tend {{to be used in}} place of human workers in automated manufacturing systems. In particular, they perform the pick‐and‐place operation, a non‐value‐added activity which at the same time cannot be eliminated. Hence, minimum time is an important consideration for economic reasons in the trajectory planning system of the manipulator. The trajectory should also be smooth to <b>handle</b> <b>parts</b> precisely in applications such as semiconductor manufacturing, processing and handling of chemicals and medicines, and fluid and aerosol deposition. In this paper, an automated trajectory planner is proposed to determine a smooth, minimum‐time and collision‐free trajectory for the pick‐and‐place operations of a 6 ‐DOF robotic manipulator in the presence of an obstacle. Subsequently, it also proposes an algorithm for the jerk‐ bounded Synchronized Trigonometric S‐curve Trajectory (STST) and the ‘forbidden‐sphere’ technique to avoid the obstacle. The proposed planner is demonstrated with suitable examples and comparisons. The experiments show that the proposed planner is capable of providing a smoother trajectory than the cubic spline based trajectory...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a Feature Recognition system developed using a previously trained Artificial Neural Network. The part description {{is taken from}} a B-rep solid modeller's data base. This description refers only to topological information about the faces in the part {{in the form of}} an Attributed Adjacency Graph. A set of heuristics is used for breaking down this compound feature graph into subgraphs, that correspond to simple features. Special representation patterns are then constructed for each of these subgraphs. These patterns are presented to a Neural Network which classifies them into feature classes: pockets, slots, passages, protrusions, steps, blind slots, corner pockets, and holes. The scope of instances/variations of these features that can be recognised is very wide. A commercially available neural network modelling tool was used for training. The user interface to the neural network recogniser has been written in Pascal. The program can <b>handle</b> <b>parts</b> with up to 200 planar or curved faces. The performance of the recogniser in terms of speed is far better than that of any other rule-based system due to the Neural Network approach employed. The basic limitation is that of the heuristics used to break down compound features into simple ones which are fed to the ANN, but this is still a step ahead compared to other approaches.

40|$|No concise legal {{framework}} exists in Greece which foresees {{any kind of}} Metropolitan Governance. Several organisms exist, mostly owned / controlled by the state, which <b>handle</b> <b>parts</b> of the metropolitan activity (OASA - public transports, EYDAP - drinking water, sewage, ESDKNA - garbage manage, etc), but nobody is controlling - coordinating. The existence of the Super-Prefecture of Athens - Piraeus (which is composed of 2 separate Prefectures - Athens and Piraeus), {{does not seem to}} help at all, as it doesn't have practically any competences, but it's compressed between the Municipalities {{on one side and the}} Region / Central Government on the other. The last years several models have been proposed - Metropolitan Prefecture, Metropolitan Municipality, Metropolitan Associations, etc, but no decision has been made yet. In the present paper i will show that a hybrid of Metropolitan Governance already exists in the Greater Athens Area and than only minor legal adjustments are needed to achieve the goal. The creation of ASDA in 1988 by the nine municipalities of West Athens, who cover a large part of the metropolitan area, showed firstly that the municipalities had perceived that some problems are common and they have to be dialled commonly and secondly the existing possibilities. In his 18 years of functioning ASDA can be considered as a public organisation with metropolitan competences, although that is not explicit in the legislation about development associations, because he advanced solutions to problems concerning the whole West Athens Area. I will show how the voluntarily cooperation of the 9 municipalities, in the beginning, 10 after, allowed them to face problems, which could have been faced only at a metropolitan level. In conclusion I will show that what is needed is not a new legal entity, but the reinforcement of existing legal forms of municipal cooperation and of the Prefecture and the absorption of the existing metropolitan wide organisations by the Prefecture. ...|$|E
40|$|Vision {{seems to}} occur {{effortlessly}} and without mistakes. As a result, {{it is easy}} to lose sight of the complex representational mechanisms going on under the hood. In macaque monkeys, the brain region thought to be the ultimate mediator of object recognition is the inferotemporal cortex (IT). The purpose of this dissertation was to investigate how IT neurons <b>handle</b> <b>parts</b> of objects, both in a context wherein parts interfere with one another as well as a context in which certain parts aren’t readily perceived. We broke this down into three distinct projects, outlined below. The first project was concerned with the behavioral phenomenon known as crowding, in which clutter causes peripheral objects to devolve into an unintelligible jumble. We are the first to develop a task that was conducive to concurrent behavior and neuronal recordings in monkeys. To demonstrate relevance of our task, we turned to a hallmark of crowding: that what matters is the eccentricity and spacing between objects, not object size. Having demonstrated this, we were set to proceed to neuronal recordings. Our primary question was whether crowding quantitatively reduced the strength of IT neuronal selectivity or alternatively whether crowding induced a qualitative change to the neuronal code. Our results support the latter hypothesis. We then asked additional follow-up questions regarding size-sensitivity and adjacency of part-part interactions. Overall, our results were incompatible with a pooling model of crowding and consistent with models based on attention, texture, or source confusion. The final experiment was concerned with whether certain parts of compound objects were preferentially represented over others. To do this we recorded IT spiking activity while monkeys viewed composite shapes made up of overlapping outlines, as well as all the possible constituent closed parts created by the overlap. Humans tend to only perceive the simpler shapes originally used to create the composite, but the same was not true of IT neurons. Instead, they represented the composite more like its external contour than any other part, especially in the initial phase of the response...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} an attempt to {{evaluate}} the status of meat hygiene in four slaughterhouses (Alkadaro, Ghanawa, Alhuda and Assabaloga) in Khartoum State. These slaughterhouses are working inthe field of local and export oriented carcasses. The assessment was based on isolation and identification of bacteria from mutton intended for export (fresh, chilled and after unloading at airport). Assessment was also based on infrastructure of these slaughterhouses (availability and condition of a diagnostic laboratory, number and condition of refrigerators, condition of slaughter halls, number of veterinarians, technicians and laborers, application of hygienic measures to inspect and <b>handle</b> <b>parts</b> of slaughtered animals, and determination of reasons of condemnation of livers, lungs, hearts and heads, which may have impact on carcass contamination). A total of 175 swab samples were made from four areas of the carcass at three stages: at the slaughter hall (75 swabs), from cold carcasses (50 swabs) and after unloading at Khartoum airport (50 swabs). Swabs were taken only from mutton of Assabaloga slaughterhouse because at that time the other slaughterhouses were not working for export. The swabs were subjected to aerobic culture using appropriate media and then identification of isolates. The isolates were identified according to their microscopic, cultural and biochemical properties. Staphylococcus epidermidis(16 %),Micrococcus luteus(10. 7 %),Kurthia zopfil(8 %),Micrococcus roseus (6. 7 %) andMicrococcus kristinae(2. 7 %) were isolated from fresh carcasses. Kurthia zopfil (16 %), Aerococcus viridans (14 %), Micrococcus varians (12 %), Micrococcus kristinae (12 %), Micrococcus luteus(10 %) and Micrococcus roseus (6 %) were isolated from chilled carcasses. Kurthia zopfil(22 %),Micrococcus varians (14 %), Micrococcus luteus(14 %),Micrococcus kristinae(10 %), Aerococcus viridans (10 %) and Staphylococcus epidermidis(4 %) were isolated from carcasses after unloading at the airport. The least contamination was in the fresh carcasses and the highest was in carcasses after unloading at the airport. From a retrospective data of the year 2007 obtained from the four slaughterhouses, reasons for condemnation of major organs at post-mortem, xi calculated from the total number of animals slaughtered in this year, were: abscess in heads (0. 3 % – 5. 0 %), fasciola in livers (0. 0 % - 2. 0 %), necrosis in livers (1. 6 % – 10 %), pneumonia in lungs (0. 6 % – 5. 0 %), cysticerci in hearts (0. 0 % - 5. 0 %) and adhesion in hearts (0. 1 % – 0. 2 %). These reasons, as stated by the authorized veterinarians in these slaughterhouses, are almost the same as those prevailing during the period of sampling in this study (April, 2008 to May, 2009). Each of the slaughterhouses had acceptable diagnostic laboratory, clean, spacious and well ventilated slaughter hall (s), reasonable number ofrefrigerators, which were of good condition, and reasonable number of veterinarians and assisting cadre. The temperature of the refrigerated vehicles was 3 °C - 4 °C and the carcasses temperature was 2 °C - 3 °C and all transporting vehicles were in good condition. There was no bad odor inthe refrigerated carcasses and no separation of liquids. This study concluded that meat hygiene status in these slaughterhouses was good and the isolated bacteria were eithernon-pathogenic or oportunistic pathogens, and it is unlikely that these bacteria werefrom infected organs at post mortem examination, but from pitfalls in application of hygienic measures during skinning and handling of organs and carcasses...|$|E
