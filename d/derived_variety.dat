50|$|Pusa 1121 is an {{essentially}} <b>derived</b> <b>variety</b> evolved {{through the process}} of hybridization over a long breeding process. The variety of basmati rice was developed by Padma Shri, Vijay Pal Singh and his student Ashok Kumar Sarial. This variety of rice is known for its extraordinary kernel (grain) length, which can be as much as 8.2 mm for a single grain, the longest-ever known released cultivar in the world. It has very high kernel elongation ratio ranging from 2 to 2.5, i.e. length of cooked rice kernel/length of uncooked kernel. When cooked, the rice does not turn sticky, possesses minimum breadth-wise expansion, and is aromatic with intermediate alkali-spreading value and amylose content.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Variety {{protection}} is of high relevance for the horticultural community and juridical cases {{have become more}} frequent in a globalized economy due to essential derivation of varieties. This applies equally to Calluna vulgaris, a vegetatively propagated species from the Ericaceae family that belongs to the top-selling pot plants in Europe. We therefore analyzed the genetic diversity of 74 selected varieties and genotypes of C. vulgaris and 3 of Erica spp. by means of RAPD and iSSR fingerprinting using 168 mono- and polymorphisms. The same data set was utilized to generate a system to reliably identify Essentially <b>Derived</b> <b>Varieties</b> (EDVs) in C. vulgaris, which was adapted from a method suggested for lettuce and barley. This system was developed, validated and used for selected tests of interest in C. vulgaris. Results As expected following personal communications with breeders, a very small genetic diversity became evident within C. vulgaris when investigated using our molecular methods. Thus, a dendrogram-based assay to detect Essentially <b>Derived</b> <b>Varieties</b> in this species is not suitable, although varieties are propagated vegetatively. In contrast, the system applied in lettuce, which itself applies pairwise comparisons using appropriate reference sets, proved functional with this species. Conclusion The narrow gene pool detected in C. vulgaris may be the genetic basis for juridical conflicts between breeders. We successfully tested a methodology for identification of Essentially <b>Derived</b> <b>Varieties</b> in highly identical C. vulgaris genotypes and recommend this for future proof of essential derivation in C. vulgaris and other vegetatively propagated crops. </p...|$|R

40|$|To get the {{protection}} for essentially <b>derived</b> <b>variety,</b> the initial variety {{must be a}} protected first, because the dependence can onlyexist in relation to protected variety. While determining whether a variety is EDV or not, {{it is to be}} noted that, an EDV can bedirectly derived from the initial variety or from any variety that itself is predominantly derived from the initial variety. Hencethere can be "cascade" of derivations. In determining the cascade of derivation, {{it should be noted that}} each EDV shall only bedependent on one, the protected initial variety; a cascade of dependence shall not exist. This principle of dependence has beenintroduced to better protect the breeder of the initial variety and not those having made just derivations. More recently, based onthe general opinion of its members, ISF moved to the definition of only one threshold that would divide the scale of conformityinto two parts: below the threshold there would be no presumption of essential derivation, above the threshold there would bepresumption of essential derivation and the burden of proof of non predominant derivation would fall on the breeder of theputative essentially <b>derived</b> <b>variety.</b> The threshold will certainly vary from species to species, depending on the existing geneticvariability within the species and the established breeding procedures. To eliminate the ‘copycat breeding’ or ‘cosmetic breeding’,the concept of ‘essential derivation’ was included in the revised UPOV convention Act (UPOV, 1991). This paper thereforefocuses on the imminent challenges to the breeders and the responsibilities they need to shoulder to respect and promote the IPand plant variety protection in India to usher in an era of incentives and benefit sharing for the plant breeders...|$|E

40|$|Derived {{varieties}} play {{an essential}} role in the theory of hyperidentities. In [11] we have shown that derivation diagrams are a useful tool in the analysis of derived algebras and varieties. In this paper this tool is developed further in order to use it for algebraic constructions of derived algebras. Especially the operator S of subalgebras, H of homomorphic irnages and P of direct products are studied. Derived groupoids from the groupoid N or (x,y) = x'∧ y' and from abelian groups are considered. The latter class serves as an example for fluid algebras and varieties.

Final comparisons were made using 26, 874 SNPs after discarding SNPs with insufficient data quality or vulnerability to ascertainment bias. Inbred lines developed in the United States or in western Europe that had been previously published to establish SSR-based thresholds provided the means to determine equivalent SNP-based protocols. Use of 3072 SNPs selected to provide even genomic coverage according to genetic and physical maps provided robust, precise, high discrimination among inbred lines with consistent zonal classification with up to 20 % missing data. Comparisons of intercepts and slopes for SSR and SNP inbred pairwise distance data translated the 82 % SSR green-orange similarity threshold to 91 % using SNPs and the 90 % SSR orange-red threshold to 95 % using SNPs.

40|$|The {{concept of}} Essentially derived {{varieties}} (EDVs) {{was introduced in}} the UPOV 1991 act to protect the interests of the breeder of the initial variety. When a variety is considered as an EDV, authorisation for commercial exploitation is needed from the breeder of the initial variety. There is considerable debate going on about which approaches to use for determining essential derivation and also which thresh-olds should be used in the different plant species. For determining whether a variety should be considered essentially derived from an existing variety two conceptually different approaches can be taken. The first one is based on genetic conformity, the second is more a forensic approach. For the implementation of the EDV concept using the conformity approach it is important that similarities between unrelated varieties can clearly be separated from essentially derived varieties. In the forensic approach the high genetic similarity between original variety and mutant is taken as a starting point. The basic idea is to calculate the probability that a second, putatively <b>derived,</b> <b>variety</b> would have a profile identical to the initial variety, given an independent breeding history. Both approaches will be illustrated and ways to implement the EDV concept will be discusse...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} genetic {{conformity}} {{lies at the}} basis of the definition of essential derivation, or the process of using a protected variety (or 'initial variety', IV) as the base to develop another similar variety (the essentially <b>derived</b> <b>variety,</b> EDV). Methods based on morphology, biochemistry or on molecular markers can be used to estimate genetic conformity. In this study, the capability of AFLP(R) (1) markers to provide a reliable and meaningful estimate of genetic conformity of different varieties was investigated in diploid perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne spp.), an allogamous species whose varieties are genetically heterogeneous. Twelve accessions with known breeding lineage, comprising five closely related groups, were included in the study. For the set of test accessions analysed, the AFLP protocol accurately reproduced the same relationships as were evident from examining their morphology and both these results were consistent with the relationships known to exist within the different test groups. Principal components analysis as well as cluster analysis associated unambiguously the IV and the EDV accessions.

40|$|A {{sample set}} of {{registered}} perennial ryegrass varieties {{was used to}} compare how morphological characterisation and AFLP® (AFLP® is a registered trademark of Keygene N. V.) and STS molecular markers described variety relationships. All the varieties were confirmed as morphologically distinct, and both the STS and AFLP markers exposed sufficient genetic diversity to differentiate these registered ryegrass varieties. Distances obtained by each of the approaches were compared, with special attention given to the coincidences and divergences between the methods. When correlations between morphological, AFLP and STS distances were calculated and the corresponding scatter-plots constructed, the variety relationships appeared to be rather inconsistent across the methods, especially between morphology and the molecular markers. However, some consistencies were found for closely related material. An implication could be that these molecular-marker techniques, while not yet suited to certain operations in the traditional registration of new varieties, could be suitable methods for investigating disputable distinctness situations or possible EDV (EDV= essentially <b>derived</b> <b>variety.</b> An EDV is a variety being clearly distinct from, but conforming in the expression of the essential characteristics of, an ¿initial variety' (IV) from which it is found to have been predominantly derived) relationships, subject to establishing standardised protocols and statistical techniques.

A combination of color and texture analysis was used as input parameter and then analyzed in the next step using the artificial neural network (ANN) to determine input parameter that has the highest accuracy level. The experiment was conducted at Merauke Experiment Station, Papua Institute for Agriculture Assessment Technology from May to July 2011. The materials used were milled rice of varieties Basmati 370, Inpari 1, and Sintanur that were previously grown at Sukamandi Experiment Station of the Indonesian Center for Rice Research (ICRR). All samples were qualified as grade 1 based on SNI 6128 : 2008.

Previously associated markers with different wheat trait are also not available in any database. Limitations of in vitro SSR discovery can be overcome by genome-wide in silico mining of SSR.

Chromosome-wise SSR calling for all the three sub genomes along with choice of motif types is provided in addition to the primer generation for desired marker. We report here a database of highest number of SSRs (476, 169) from complex, hexaploid wheat genome (~ 17 GB) along with previously reported 268 SSR markers associated with 11 traits.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{extending}} intellectual property protection to agriculture {{in developing countries}} has met with counterclaims for granting farmers' rights. Developing countries are currently attempting to fulfill these demands by evolving new IPR regimes that simultaneously {{protect the rights of}} breeders and farmers. What are the possible implications of establishing such a system of multiple rights on the utilization and exchange of genetic resources among various actors? Could the attempt to distribute ownership rights to various stakeholders pose the threat of an ‘anticommons,' where resources are underutilized due to multiple ownership? The answers to these questions have important implications for the future of agricultural growth in developing countries. India {{is one of the first}} countries in the world to have passed a legislation granting rights to both breeders and farmers under the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001. The law emerged from a process that attempted to incorporate the interests of various stakeholders, including private sector breeders, public sector institutions, non-governmental organizations and farmers, within the property rights framework. India's Act allows four types of varieties to be registered reflecting the interests of actors: New Variety, Extant Variety, Essentially <b>Derived</b> <b>Variety</b> and Farmers' Variety. Although this multiple rights system aims to equitably distribute rights, it could pose problems of overlapping claims and result in complicated bargaining requirements for utilization of varieties. A potential implication is an ‘anticommons tragedy' where too many parties independently posses the right to exclude giving rise to underutilization of resources. India and other developing nations, in seeking to achieve the important goal of recognizing farmers' rights, must not overlook the need for promoting exchange of agricultural resources. India's Plant Variety and Farmers' Right Act is significant both in the domestic and international context as several other countries are trying to establish similar legislations. Advanced nations must recognize that compelling developing countries to grant breeders rights could result in systems that run counter to their interests. Developed and developing countries must make a concerted effort to ensure that emerging IPR regimes do not restrict stakeholder access to genetic resources. breeders rights, india, intellectual property, South Asia,...|$|E
