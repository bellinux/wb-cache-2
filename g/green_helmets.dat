25|$|For several decades, the Eagles' {{colors were}} kelly green, silver, and white. In 1954, the Eagles, {{along with the}} Baltimore Colts, became the second team ever in the NFL to put a logo on their helmets, with silver wings on a kelly green helmet. In 1969, the team wore two helmet versions: Kelly green with white wings in road games, and white with kelly green wings at home. From 1970 to '73, they wore the white helmets with Kelly green wings {{exclusively}} before switching back to Kelly <b>green</b> <b>helmets</b> with silver wings. By 1974, Joseph A. Scirrotto Jr. designed the silver wings took on a white outline, and this style on a kelly green helmet became standard for over two decades.|$|E

2500|$|The Oregon uniform {{underwent}} {{a radical change}} for the 1999 season, where new, Nike-designed gear featuring a redesigned [...] "O" [...] emblem with solid <b>green</b> <b>helmets</b> and jerseys with lightning yellow letters were revealed. This began a period of unusually non-uniform standards for a typical college football team. Since 1999, Oregon has completely revised its uniform appearance roughly every three seasons. The frequent uniform changes and their typically flashy uniform have provoked some controversy. Fans of a more traditional approach to college football tend to ridicule each new uniform as it is released, [...] while younger fans and players—in particular, potential Oregon athletes—react more favorably to the flashy nature of the livery.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, the helmet's {{background}} color was changed from white to red, primarily to help Bills quarterback Joe Ferguson distinguish them more readily from {{three of their}} division rivals at that time, the Baltimore Colts, the Miami Dolphins, and the New England Patriots, who all also wore white helmets at that point. Ferguson said [...] "Everyone we played had white helmets at that time. Our new head coach Kay Stephenson {{just wanted to get}} more of a contrast on the field that may help spot a receiver down the field." [...] (The Patriots now use a silver helmet, the Colts have since been realigned to the AFC South, and the New York Jets, who switched to <b>green</b> <b>helmets</b> after the 1977 season, have since switched back to white helmets.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In One Day International cricket and Twenty20 International cricket, {{the team}} wears uniforms usually {{coloured}} green and gold, the national colours of Australia. There {{has been a}} variety of different styles and layouts used in both forms of the limited-overs game, with coloured clothing (sometimes known as [...] "pyjamas") being introduced for World Series Cricket in the late 1970s. The sponsors' logos (the Victoria Bitter for Home ODIs, KFC for Home Twenty20s and Qantas for Away ODIs and Away Twenty20) are prominently displayed on the shirts and other gears. The Current Home ODI Kit consists of green as the primary colour and gold as the secondary colour. The Away Kit is the opposite of the Home Kit with gold as the primary colour and green as the secondary colour. The Home Twenty20s uniform consists of black with the natural colours of Australia, green and gold strips. However, since Australia beat New Zealand in MCG in the 2015 Cricket World Cup wearing the gold uniform, it has also become their primary colour, with the hats used being called 'floppy gold', formerly known as 'baggy gold', a limited-overs equivalent to a Baggy Green. Until the late 2000s, in the ODIs, Australia wore yellow helmets, before switching to <b>green</b> <b>helmets.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Eskimos {{had their}} jerseys remodelled for the 2012 season {{and brought back}} the <b>green</b> <b>helmets</b> that were worn for the Labour Day game and rematch in 2008. The <b>green</b> <b>helmets</b> were worn with the away jerseys and {{marked the first time}} in {{franchise}} history that a helmet other than gold was worn as a regular facet of the uniform. It was also the first time in franchise history that two different helmets were worn for home and away uniforms. The team also stopped alternating pant and jersey combinations during this season, using consistent home and away looks all year long. However, during the following season, on August 24, 2013, the Eskimos returned to the all-green combination of <b>green</b> <b>helmets,</b> jerseys, and pants that had not been worn since 2008. The Eskimos first wore their gold helmets with their away uniforms for a regular season game on October 19, 2014 and wore them again in the post-season on November 23, 2014 with matching gold pants. Gold helmets were worn with away uniforms in three of eight regular season games in 2015. In 2014, the team introduced their Signature series alternate uniforms, which was the second alternate uniform to be worn in team history (not including throwback jerseys).|$|E

5000|$|After World War II, Barclay's {{headquarters}} were {{relocated to}} Union City, New Jersey. Despite the inroads of plastic toy soldiers, Barclay kept manufacturing theirs in metal.
