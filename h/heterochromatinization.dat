The following physiological indexes were determined: arterial blood pressure, pulse frequency, and frequency of breathing. The physical stress produced by the dosed physical activity causes the considerable increase of degree of <b>heterochromatinization</b> in the cell nuclei of human buccal epithelium.

40|$|Chromosomes of {{schistosome}} parasites among digenetic flukes have {{a unique}} evolution because they exhibit the sex chromosomes ZW, which are {{not found in the}} other groups of flukes that are hermaphrodites. We conducted molecular cytogenetic analyses for investigating the sex chromosome evolution using chromosome paint analysis and BAC clones mapping. To carry this out, we developed a technique for making paint probes of genomic DNA from a single scraped chromosome segment using a chromosome microdissection system, and a FISH mapping technique for BAC clones. Paint probes clearly identified each of the 8 pairs of chromosomes by a different fluorochrome color. Combination analysis of chromosome paint analysis with Z/W probes and chromosome mapping with 93 BAC clones revealed that the W chromosome of Schistosoma mansoni has evolved by at least four inversion events and <b>heterochromatinization.</b> Nine of 93 BAC clones hybridized with both the Z and W chromosomes, but the locations were different between Z and W chromosomes. The homologous regions were estimated to have moved from the original Z chromosome to the differentiated W chromosome by three inversions events that occurred before W heterohcromatinization. An inversion that was observed in the heterochromatic region of the W chromosome likely occurred after W <b>heterochromatinization.</b> These inversions and <b>heterochromatinization</b> are hypothesized to be the key factors that promoted the evolution of the W chromosome of S. mansoni...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{which is}} the first {{karyotype}} analysis of Hypostomus iheringii, nine specimens collected in Córrego da Lapa (tributary of the Passa-Cinco River) showed a diploid number of 80 chromosomes. Silver nitrate staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with an 18 S rDNA probe revealed the presence of multiple nucleolus organizer regions (NORs) (chromosome pairs 13, 20, and 34). FISH with a 5 S rDNA probe showed that this cistron was only present in chromosome pair 2. When the karyotypes of individual animals were compared, unique heterochromatic polymorphisms were detected on chromosome pairs 1 and 5. Specifically, specimens had heterochromatic blocks (h+h+) on both chromosomes, one chromosome with heterochromatic blocks (h+h-) or chromosomes that lacked heterochromatic blocks (h-h-). Considering that heteromorphic pattern is not correlated with variation in size, the process of <b>heterochromatinization</b> might act on the long arms of these chromosomes. In summary, all chromosomal markers indicate that the karyotype of H. iheringii is highly differentiated and that the <b>heterochromatinization</b> of chromosomal segments may have contributed to its karyotypic differentiation...|$|E

Microarray analysis now shows that this enzyme may operate as a master regulator that inactivates numerous early-embryonic genes by bringing about <b>heterochromatinization</b> of methylated histone H 3 K 9 and de novo DNA methylation. Genetic studies in differentiating embryonic stem cells demonstrate that a point mutation in the G 9 a SET domain prevents <b>heterochromatinization</b> but still allows de novo methylation, whereas biochemical and functional studies indicate that G 9 a itself is capable of bringing about de novo methylation through its ankyrin domain, by recruiting Dnmt 3 a and Dnmt 3 b independently of its histone methyltransferase activity.

It is a result of CGG repeat expansion in the 5 ′ untranslated region (5 ′ UTR) of the FMR 1 gene. This gene encodes the FMRP protein that is involved in neuronal development. Repeat expansion leads to <b>heterochromatinization</b> of the promoter, gene silencing, and the subsequent absence of FMRP. To date, there is no specific therapy for the syndrome. All treatments in clinic practice provide symptomatic therapy. The development of drug therapy for Fragile X syndrome treatment is connected with the search for inhibitors of enzymes that are responsible for <b>heterochromatinization.</b> Here, we report a weak transcriptional activity of the FMR 1 gene and the absence of FMRP protein after Fragile X syndrome cell lines treatment with two FDA approved inhibitors of histone deacetylases, romidepsin and vorinostat. We demonstrate that romidepsin, an inhibitor of class I histone deacetylases, does not activate FMR 1 expression in patient cell cultures, whereas vorinostat, an inhibitor of classes I and II histone deacetylases, activates a low level of FMR 1 expression in some patient cell lines...|$|E

40|$|A {{transgenic}} gpt+ Chinese hamster {{cell line}} (G 12) {{was found to}} be susceptible to carcinogenic nickel-induced inactivation of gpt expression without mutagenesis or deletion of the transgene. Many nickel-induced 6 -thioguanine-resistant variants spontaneously reverted to actively express gpt, as indicated by both reversion assays and direct enzyme measurements. Since reversion was enhanced in many of the nickel-induced variant cell lines following 24 -h treatment with the demethylating agent 5 -azacytidine, the involvement of DNA methylation in silencing gpt expression was suspected. This was confirmed by demonstrations of increased DNA methylation, as well as by evidence indicating condensed chromatin and <b>heterochromatinization</b> of the gpt integration site in 6 -thioguanine-resistant cells. Upon reversion to active gpt expression, DNA methylation and condensation are lost. We propose that DNA condensation and methylation result in <b>heterochromatinization</b> of the gpt sequence with subsequent inheritance of the now silenced gene. This mechanism is supported by direct evidence showing that acute nickel treatment of cultured cells, and of isolated nuclei in vitro, can indeed facilitate gpt sequence-specific chromatin condensation. Epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the actions of some nonmutagenic carcinogens, and DNA methylation changes are now known to be important in carcinogenesis. This paper further supports the emerging theory that nickel is a human carcinogen that can alter gene expression by enhanced DNA methylation and compaction, rather than by mutagenic mechanisms...|$|E

Considering that African {{swine fever virus}} (ASFV) intranuclear phase of infection is poorly understood, viral interplay with subnuclear domains and chromatin architecture were addressed. Nuclear speckles, Cajal bodies, and promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) were evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot. Further, efficient PML protein knockdown by shRNA lentiviral transduction {{was used to determine}} PML-NBs relevance during infection. Nuclear distribution of different histone H 3 methylation marks at lysine’s 9, 27 and 36, heterochromatin protein 1 isoforms (HP 1 α, HPβ and HPγ) and several histone deacetylases (HDACs) were also evaluated to assess chromatin status of the host. Our results reveal morphological disruption of all studied subnuclear domains and severe reduction of viral progeny in PML-knockdown cells. ASFV promotes H 3 K 9 me 3 and HP 1 β foci formation from early infection, followed by HP 1 α and HDAC 2 nuclear enrichment, suggesting <b>heterochromatinization</b> of host genome. Finally, closeness between DNA damage response factors, disrupted PML-NBs, and virus-induced heterochromatic regions were identified. In sum, our results demonstrate that ASFV orchestrates spatio-temporal nuclear rearrangements, changing subnuclear domains, relocating Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Rad- 3 related (ATR) -related factors and promoting <b>heterochromatinization,</b> probably controlling transcription, repressing host gene expression, and favouring viral replication...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal and {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder with identified genetic causes representing a significant minority of all cases. A GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) mutation within the C 9 ORF 72 gene {{has recently been}} identified as the most frequent known cause of ALS. The expansion leads to partial <b>heterochromatinization</b> of the locus, yet mutant RNAs and dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) are still produced in sufficient quantities to confer neurotoxicity. The levels of these toxic HRE products positively correlate with cellular toxicity and phenotypic severity across multiple disease models. Moreover, the degree of epigenetic repression inversely correlates with some facets of clinical presentation in C 9 -ALS patients. Recently, bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) {{have been used to}} generate transgenic mice that harbor the HRE mutation, complementing other relevant model systems such as patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). While epigenetic features of the HRE have been investigated in various model systems and post-mortem tissues, epigenetic dysregulation at the expanded locus in C 9 -BAC mice remains unexplored. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we sought to determine whether clinically relevant epigenetic perturbations caused by the HRE are mirrored in a C 9 -BAC mouse model. We used complementary DNA methylation assessment and immunoprecipitation methods to demonstrate that epigenetic aberrations caused by the HRE, such as DNA and histone methylation, are recapitulated in the C 9 -BAC mice. Strikingly, we found that cytosine hypermethylation within the promoter region of the human transgene occurred in a subset of C 9 -BAC mice similar to what is observed in patient populations. Moreover, we show that partial <b>heterochromatinization</b> of the C 9 HRE occurs during the first weeks of the mouse lifespan, indicating age-dependent epigenetic repression. Using iPSC neurons, we found that preventing R-loop formation did not impede <b>heterochromatinization</b> of the HRE. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these observations provide further insight into mechanism and developmental time-course of epigenetic perturbations conferred by the C 9 ORF 72 HRE. Finally, we suggest that epigenetic repression of the C 9 ORF 72 HRE and nearby gene promoter could impede or delay motor neuron degeneration in C 9 -BAC mouse models of ALS/FTD...|$|E

The results obtained indicated that the rate of replication fork movement slows down and the inter-origin distance becomes shorter during the precommitment and commitment periods before cells stop proliferating and accumulate in G 1.

Yeast Hir 3 p has weak homology to CABIN 1, a fourth member of the human complex, suggesting that Hir 3 p and CABIN 1 may be orthologs. Here we show that HIRA and CABIN 1 interact at ectopic and endogenous levels of expression in cells, and we isolate the quaternary HIRA/UBN 1 /CABIN 1 /ASF 1 a (HUCA) complex, assembled from recombinant proteins. Mutational analyses {{support the view that}} HIRA acts as a scaffold to bring together UBN 1, ASF 1 a, and CABIN 1 into a quaternary complex. We show that, like HIRA, UBN 1, and ASF 1 a, CABIN 1 is involved in <b>heterochromatinization</b> of the genome of senescent human cells. Moreover, in proliferating cells, HIRA and CABIN 1 regulate overlapping sets of genes, and these genes are enriched in the histone variant H 3. 3.

This dominant effect can be very strong, as inactivation is detectable when {{as many as three}} trans copies of the gene are present. We show that pteridine reductions coincide with similar reductions in the accumulation of brown mRNA. The dominant effect is suppressed by certain altered structural configurations of the brown region, suggesting that somatic pairing is involved in the phenomenon.

40|$|AbstractIn female mammals a “random choice” {{mechanism}} decides {{which of}} the two X chromosomes will be inactivated. It has been postulated that Xist is crucial for <b>heterochromatinization</b> and thus functions downstream of the choice mechanism. Here we report that females heterozygous for an internal deletion in the Xist gene, which includes part of exon 1 and extends to exon 5, undergo primary nonrandom inactivation of the wild-type X chromosome. The Xist gene, therefore, not only has a role in chromatin remodeling, but also includes an element required for X chromosome choosing. In conflict with the prevailing view of how choosing occurs, the element identified by the deletion plays a positive role in the choice mechanism and forces a reassessment of how X chromosome choosing is thought to occur...|$|E

The long-held hypothesis that this gene silencing is associated with an altered chromatin structure received direct support only recently. Another gene-silencing phenomenon in Drosophila, although similar in its phenotype of variegation, {{has been shown to}} be associated with euchromatic sequences and is dependent on developmental regulators of the Polycomb group (Pc-G) of gene products. One model proposes that the Pc-G products may cause a local <b>heterochromatinization</b> that maintains a repressed state of transcription of their target genes. Here, we test these models by measuring the accessibility of white or miniwhite sequences, in different contexts, to the Escherichia coli dam DNA methyltransferase in vivo.

Parental genomes were spatially separated within the hybrid nucleus, and pearl millet chromatin destined for elimination occupied peripheral interphase positions. Structural reorganization of the paternal chromosomes occurred, and mitotic behavior differed between the parental chromosomes. We provide evidence for a novel chromosome elimination pathway that involves the formation of nuclear extrusions during interphase in addition to postmitotically formed micronuclei.

Our work demonstrates that a subtle mutation in pRB that cripples its ability to interact with chromatin regulators impairs <b>heterochromatinization</b> and repression of E 2 F-responsive promoters during senescence.

However, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms that govern the expression of this locus. Here we have identified a putative DNA replication origin at the INK 4 /ARF locus that assembles a multiprotein complex containing Cdc 6, Orc 2 and MCMs, and that coincides with a conserved noncoding DNA element (regulatory domain RDINK 4 /ARF). Targeted and localized RNA-interference-induced <b>heterochromatinization</b> of RDINK 4 /ARF results in transcriptional repression of the locus, revealing that RD INK 4 /ARF is a relevant transcriptional regulatory element. Cdc 6 is overexpressed in human cancers, where it might have roles in addition to DNA replication 3 - 5. We have found that high levels of Cdc 6 result in RDINK 4 /ARF-dependent transcriptional repression, recruitment of histone deacetylases and <b>heterochromatinization</b> of the INK 4 /ARF locus, and a concomitant decrease in the expression of the three tumour suppressors encoded by this locus. This mechanism is reminiscent of the silencing of the mating-type HM loci in yeast by replication factors 6. Consistent with its ability to repress the INK 4 /ARF locus, Cdc 6 has cellular immortalization activity and neoplastic transformation capacity in cooperation with oncogenic Ras. Furthermore, human lung carcinomas with high levels of Cdc 6 are associated with low levels of p 16 INK 4 a. We conclude that aberrant expression of Cdc 6 is oncogenic by directly repressing the INK 4 /ARF locus through the RD INK 4 /ARF element. Â© 2006 Nature Publishing Group. S.

Surprisingly, even placental mammals show differences in the initiation of XCI in terms of Xist regulation and the timing to acquire dosage compensation.

Here, we show that slowing replication forks by depleting nucleotide pools with hydroxyurea (HU) can also give rise to both transient and permanent epigenetic instability of a reporter locus, BU- 1, in DT 40 cells. HU induces stochastic formation of Bu- 1 low variants in dividing cells, which have lost the H 3 K 4 me 3 present in untreated cells. This instability is potentiated by an intragenic G quadruplex, which also promotes local H 2 Ax phosphorylation and transient <b>heterochromatinization.</b> Genome-wide, gene expression changes induced by HU significantly overlap with those resulting from loss of the G 4 -helicases FANCJ, WRN, and BLM. Thus, the effects of global replication stress induced by nucleotide pool depletion can be focused by local replication impediments caused by G quadruplex formation to induce epigenetic instability and changes in gene expression, a mechanism that may contribute to selectable transcriptional changes in cancer...|$|E

40|$|Cancer is major disease causing {{worldwide}} human death {{which is}} related to different epigenetic dysregulation. One of the major dysregulation is overexpression of histone deacetylase (HDAC) including, HDAC 1, HDAC 4, HDAC 6 and HDAC 7. HDAC upregulation leads to histone deacetylation at the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes and promote histone 3 lysine 9 methylation helping in <b>heterochromatinization,</b> leading to abnormal changes in chromatin pattern followed by tumorigenesis. In this project novel HDAC inhibitor finding will focus a new light on cancer therapy. Our normal diet of fruits and vegetables, contain different bioactive compounds like sulforephine, allyl disulfite and butyrate, which have anti-cancerous property. Insilco study illustrate that these bioactive compound inhibit HDAC 4, 7 and 6 by binding with the active site of HDAC enzyme. This HDAC-bioactive compound complex become inactive and fails to remove acetyl group from histone tail which helps in cancer inhibition. Further experimental research will confirm the evidence of these novel inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|<b>Heterochromatinization</b> at {{the silent}} mating-type loci HMR and HML in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is {{achieved}} by targeting the Sir complex to these regions via a set of anchor proteins that bind to the silencers. Here, we have identified a novel heterochromatin-targeting factor for HML, the protein Sum 1, a repressor of meiotic genes during vegetative growth. Sum 1 bound both in vitro and in vivo to HML via a functional element within the HML-E silencer, and sum 1 {Delta} caused HML derepression. Significantly, Sum 1 was also required for origin activity of HML-E, demonstrating a role of Sum 1 in replication initiation. In a genome-wide search for Sum 1 -regulated origins, we identified a set of autonomous replicative sequences (ARS elements) that bound both the origin recognition complex and Sum 1. Full initiation activity of these origins required Sum 1, and their origin activity was decreased upon removal of the Sum 1 -binding site. Thus, Sum 1 constitutes a novel global regulator of replication initiation in yeast...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we present}} {{and develop the}} {{hypothesis}} that the derepression of endogenous retrotransposable elements (RTEs) – genomic parasites – is an important and hitherto under-unexplored molecular aging process that can potentially occur in most tissues. We further envision that the activation and continued presence of retrotransposition contribute to age-associated tissue degeneration and pathology. Chromatin is a complex and dynamic structure that needs to be maintained in a functional state throughout our lifetime. Studies of diverse species have revealed that chromatin undergoes extensive rearrangements during aging. Cellular senescence, an important component of mammalian aging, has recently been associated with decreased <b>heterochromatinization</b> of normally silenced regions of the genome. These changes lead to the expression of RTEs, culminating in their transposition. RTEs are common in all kingdoms of life, and comprise close to 50 % of mammalian genomes. They are tightly controlled, as their activity is highly destabilizing and mutagenic to their resident genomes. Keywords aging; anti-retroviral therapy; cellular senescence; retrotranspositio...|$|E
