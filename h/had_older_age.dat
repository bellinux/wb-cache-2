40|$|INTRODUCTION: Behavioral {{disturbances}} {{in patients with}} Alzheimer's disease (AD) are ill-defined conditions. We hypothesize that the many behavioral disturbances hitherto described and studied might be grouped into few syndromes with separate determinants and correlates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 162 consecutive patients with probable AD admitted to a dementia unit were assessed by the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). RESULTS: Factor analysis was carried out on NPI subscales, leading to three syndromes: 'mood', 'psychotic' and 'frontal'. Patients with the 'psychotic' syndrome were older, <b>had</b> <b>older</b> <b>age</b> at dementia onset, had poorer cognition, were more often males, and had faster rate of dementia progression. Patients with the 'frontal' syndrome had higher education, longer disease duration, and slower rate of progression. DISCUSSION: Some combinations of behavioral disturbances occur more frequently together and might represent separate behavioral syndromes. Different clinical correlates of the syndromes suggest separate etiologies...|$|E
40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} vision function index and falls-related factors in patients with age-related cataract. METHODS:Ninety-six patients with age-related cataract were interviewed using a seven-item visual function questionnaire(VF- 7), then classified into poor, moderate, or good visual function group. The differences {{of the three groups}} on visual acuity, balance and mobility function, cognition, depressive symptoms, self-reported fear of falling were analyzed. RESULTS:The patients in poor visual function group <b>had</b> <b>older</b> <b>age,</b> tendency to depression, was more afraid of falling, compared with groups with higher score in VF- 7, and they had worse visual acuity, performed worse on all balance and mobility tests. CONCLUSION:Poor visual function is related to worse visual acuity, weaker balance and mobility performance in patients with age-related cataract. The VF- 7, as a simple and convenient self-reported method, {{can be used as a}} falling risk monitoring in patients with age-related cataract...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Cerebrovascular {{complications}} are severe events following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). This study {{aimed to}} observe the clinical and neuroimaging features and possible risk factors of in-hospital cerebrovascular complications in the patients who underwent OLT. Patients and methods We retrospectively reviewed 337 consecutive patients who underwent 358 OLTs. Cerebrovascular complications were determined by clinical and neuroimaging manifestations, and the possible risk factors were analyzed in the patients with intracranial hemorrhage. Results Ten of 337 (3. 0 %) patients developed in-hospital cerebrovascular complications (8 cases experienced intracranial hemorrhage and 2 cases had cerebral infarction), and 6 of them died. The clinical presentations were similar to common stroke, but with rapid deterioration at early stage. The hematomas on brain CT scan were massive, irregular, multifocal and diffuse, {{and most of them}} were located at brain lobes and might enlarge or rebleed. Infarcts presented lacunar and multifocal lesions in basal gangliar but with possible hemorrhagic transformation. The patients with intracranial hemorrhage <b>had</b> <b>older</b> <b>age</b> and a more frequency of systemic infection than non-intracranial hemorrhage patients. (P = 0. 011 and 0. 029, respectively). Conclusion Posttransplant cerebrovascular complications have severe impact on outcome of the patients who received OLT. Older age and systemic infection may be the possible risk factors of in-hospital intracranial hemorrhage following OLT. </p...|$|E

40|$|Angioedema is {{an abrupt}} {{swelling}} of the skin, mucous membrane, or both including respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. This study aimed to report an experience of angioedema in a university hospital with respect to etiologies, clinical features, treatment, and outcome. One hundred and five patients were enrolled. About half had angioedema without urticaria. The common sites of involvement were periorbital area and lips. Forty five patients (49 %) had systemic symptoms. The {{most common cause of}} angioedema was allergic angioedema. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced angioedema and idiopathic angioedema were detected in 20 % and 18 %, respectively. Among patients with allergic angioedema, 41. 7 % were caused by food, 39. 6 % by drugs. Thirty seven patients (39 %) had recurrent attacks of angioedema. Mean standard deviation (SD) number of attacks in patients with recurrent angioedema was 3. 9 (2. 7) (ranging from 2 to 10 times). Patients who <b>had</b> <b>older</b> <b>age</b> and multiple sites of skin involvement had tendency to have systemic symptoms. Copyright Â© 2007 Kanokvalai Kulthanan et al.

40|$|Background. Long-term {{outcomes}} (mortality and health-related {{quality of}} life) of sepsis have risen as important indicators for health care. Pulmonary infection and abdominal infection {{are the leading}} causes of sepsis. However, few researches about long-term outcomes focused {{on the origin of}} sepsis. Here we aim to study the clinical differences between pulmonary-sepsis and abdominal-sepsis and to investigate whether different infection foci were associated with long-term outcomes. Methods. Patients who survived after hospital discharge were followed up by telephone interview. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed using the EuroQol 5 -dimension (EQ 5 D) questionnaire. Results. Four hundred and eighty-three sepsis patients were included, 272 (56. 3 %) had pulmonary-sepsis, and 180 (37. 3 %) had abdominal-sepsis. The overall ICU and one-year mortality rates of the cohort were 17. 8 % and 36. 1 %, respectively. Compared with abdominal-sepsis, pulmonary-sepsis patients <b>had</b> <b>older</b> <b>age,</b> higher APACHE II, higher ICU mortality (31. 7 % versus 12. 6 %), and one-year mortality (45. 4 % versus 24. 4 %), together with worse QoL. Age, septic shock, acute renal failure, fungus infection, anion gap, and pulmonary infection were predictors for one-year mortality and pulmonary infection was a risk factor for poor QoL. Conclusions. Pulmonary-sepsis showed worse outcome than abdominal-sepsis. Pulmonary infection is a risk factor for one-year mortality and QoL after sepsis...|$|E
40|$|Background: An {{outbreak}} of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) {{has been reported}} in Hong Kong. We investigated the viral cause and clinical presentation among 50 patients. Methods: We analysed case notes and microbiological findings for 50 patients with SARS, representing more than five separate epidemiologically linked transmission clusters. We defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera samples. We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked. Findings: Patients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years. Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints. When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild. Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and <b>had</b> <b>older</b> <b>age,</b> lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease. A virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from two patients. By use of serological and reverse-transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with SARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus. Interpretation: A coronavirus was isolated from patients with SARS that might be the primary agent associated with this disease. Serological and molecular tests specific for the virus permitted a definitive laboratory diagnosis to be made and allowed further investigation to define whether other cofactors play a part in disease progression. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: Reassess the {{diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in patients treated with anti-cholinesterases dispensed by High Cost Drug stores (Exceptional Drugs Program). Methods: A prospective study to reassess {{the diagnosis}} of probable Alzheimer's Disease was conducted (AD). The patients were submitted to the protocol of dementia investigation at the Neurogeriatric Outpatient Clinic of the Teaching Hospital de Base de SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto. Groups were classified using the criteria of the National Institute of Neurologic and Communicative Diseases and Vascular Cerebral Accident and Alzheimer Disease Related Association (NINCDS-ADRDA). The study was completed by applying the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD). The significance level was set at 5 %. Results: 106 patients participated, selected randomly {{from a group of}} 390 patients contacted when receiving their medication at the High Cost Drug store. Two groups were formed: the first, containing 52 patients who fulfilled criteria for AD (FC Group); and a second, with 54 patients not fulfilling criteria (NFC). The FC Group <b>had</b> <b>older</b> <b>age,</b> worse performance on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and poorer performance on the DAD. Also, treatment time was longer and drugs doses higher in the FC Group. Conclusion: Study results showed a high number of patients using anti-cholinesterases that did not fulfill the diagnosis criteria for probable AD. Comparison of the two groups revealed different behavior between them, corroborating the hypothesis of inadequate inclusion of the NFC Group patients in the Exceptional Drugs Program...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although {{inflammation}} has {{a defined}} role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the link between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) parameters of disease activity and atherosclerotic findings are not defined. Objective: To investigate the association between subclinical carotid atherosclerosis and clinical/laboratorial parameters of RA systemic inflammatory activity. Methods: Seventy-one RA patients were consecutively selected and compared to 53 healthy controls. Smoking, diabetes and hypertension were excluded, {{as well as the}} use of statins or fibrates. B-mode carotid ultrasound was performed in all subjects. CRP, ESR and fibrinogen were determined in both groups. Clinical assessment of RA activity included DAS 28 and SDAI. Correlation between plaques and intima-media thickness (IMT) of common carotid arteries and inflammatory parameters was evaluated. Results: Carotid plaques were more prevalent in RA patients than in controls (14. 1 % vs. 1. 9 %, p= 0. 02) and marginally increased IMT was observed (0. 72 +/- 0. 17 vs. 0. 67 +/- 0. 15 mm, p= 0. 07). RA patients with plaques <b>had</b> <b>older</b> <b>age</b> (p= 0. 001) and increased IMT (p< 0. 001), but low SDAI (p= 0. 025) compared to those without plaques. RA patients with plaques had also longer disease duration, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p= 0. 06). No significant correlations were found between IMT and ESR (p= 0. 80), CRP (p= 0. 75), fibrinogen (p= 0. 94), HAQ (p= 0. 89) and DAS 28 (p= 0. 13). Conclusions: Carotid atherosclerosis is more frequently detected in RA but its prevalence was not correlated with isolated inflammatory markers measurement or noncumulative activity scores. These findings reinforce the need to evaluate subclinical atherosclerosis in RA patients, and to find predictors of atherosclerotic lesions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Background: Therapy {{intensification}} (TI) is {{the most}} important factor in bloodÂ pressure control among the adherent patients. The TI is the physician prescription behavior toÂ add the item(s) and/or the dosage of hypertensive medicine when the patients' BP was â¥ 10 mmHgÂ above the target. Comorbid patients have 10 mmHg lower BP target. Aims: to evaluate the effectÂ of comorbidity on TI score and blood pressure control; and to correlate the variables of TI and BPÂ control. Method: retrospective cohort study done in 4 hospitals in Yogyakarta for 5 months. TheÂ subjects of age > 18 years, hypertensive out-patient covered with Askes insurance, and â¥ 1 visitÂ with uncontrolled BP were included. Hemodialysis subjects were excluded. Subjects wereÂ grouped into with/without comorbid. The BP profile was analyzed with T-test, repeatedmeasurement Anova, and odds ratio. Results: subjects consisted of without (WO) (n= 268) vs. Â with comorbid (W) (n= 401) patients. Comorbid subjects <b>had</b> <b>older</b> <b>age,</b> more male proportionÂ and more visits (p 0. 05); the final SBP: worse BP control 20. 9 (WO) vs. 16. 2 % (W), notÂ controlled in all visits 38. 1 vs. 45. 9 %, improved 17. 5 vs. 23. 9 %, and good controlled in all visitÂ  23. 5 vs. 13. 2 %; proportion of subjects reached BP target 40. 7 % (WO) vs. 37. 4 % (W) (p> 0. 05);Â the different of final minus target SBP: (-) 9. 0 Â± 18. 5 vs. (-) 13. 9 Â± 17. 4 mmHg (p< 0. 05); correlationÂ between TI and variables of SBP (p< 0. 05) with the coefficient (r) at 0. 4 - 0. 6 (medium). Â Conclusion: comorbidity had no effect on TI score; but subjects with comorbid had worse BPÂ control (p< 0. 05); TI score correlated in medium level with SBP.

40|$|Spontaneous {{dissection}} of cervical arteries (sCAD) is a {{major cause}} of ischemic stroke in young patients, with an incidence varying from 1. 7 to 3 / 100, 000 /year for extracranial internal carotid artery (ICAD) and 1 to 1. 9 / 100, 000 /year for extracranial vertebral artery (VAD). Reliable epidemiological data on stroke incidence related to sCAD are scarce in Italy. This study aims to evaluate the incidence, clinical features, and outcome of cerebrovascular events related to sCAD and spontaneous intracranial arteries dissections (sIAD) in the city of Pisa (Italy). We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients admitted between December 1997 and June 2015 with a diagnosis of stroke, TIA, or Bernard-Horner syndrome due to acute cervical or intracranial artery dissection. Considering that our hospital collects presumptively all patients hospitalized with sCAD coming from the referral geographical area, data may provide a good approximation to real incidence of sCAD in our population. Clinical and radiological features, acute treatment and outcome were collected. Seventy-seven cases were included (mean age 48. 1 Â± 10. 4 Â years, range 23 - 77, 72. 7 % males), 66 residents in the district of Pisa. Crude incidence rate of cerebrovascular events due to intra or extracranial dissection was 1. 88 / 100, 000 /year. The incidence of ICAD was 0. 80 / 100, 000 /year and 0. 43 / 100, 000 /year for VAD. Stroke occurred in 76. 6 % of patients. VAD was more prone to cause ischemic stroke and present with cervical pain or focal signs (pÂ <Â  0. 01) than ICAD group, which <b>had</b> <b>older</b> <b>age</b> at onset. sIAD were more frequent in the posterior circle (pÂ =Â  0. 01) and more associated with ischemic lesions.

40|$|Clinical use of CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scoring {{systems for}} {{predicting}} AF following cardiac surgery {{have been reported}} in previous studies and demonstrated well-validated predictive value. We sought to investigate whether the two scoring systems are effective for predicting new-onset of AF following cardiac valve surgery and to demonstrate its potential utility of clinical assessment. Medical records of all patients underwent cardiac valve surgeries during the period of January 2003 and December 2013 without preoperative AF at the cardiac center of our university were reviewed. The main outcome end point of our study was the early new-onset of AF following cardiac valve surgery. There were overall 518 patients involved in this study, with 234 (45. 17 %) developed POAF following valve surgery. Patients with POAF <b>had</b> <b>older</b> <b>age</b> (P= 0. 23) and higher BMI (P= 0. 013) than those without POAF. History of heart failure (P= 0. 025), hypertension (P= 0. 021), previous stroke or TIA (P= 0. 032), coronary artery disease (P= 0. 001), carotid artery disease (P= 0. 024) and preoperative medication of statins (P= 0. 021) were significantly more recorded in POAF group. Patients with POAF also had higher LAD (P= 0. 013) and E/e' ratio (P< 0. 001). The CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores were significantly higher in patients with POAF (P= 0. 002; P< 0. 001), and under univariate and multivariate regression analysis the CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores were significant predictors of POAF (P= 0. 001; P< 0. 001). Based on stratification of CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores, the Kaplan-Meier analysis obtained a higher POAF rate on patients with higher stratification of CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores (P< 0. 001; P< 0. 001). In conclusion, CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores were directly associated with the incidence of POAF following valve surgery and a higher score was strongly predictive of POAF...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{dialysis}} patients, {{coronary angiography}} (CA) predicts major adverse coronary events (MACE) better than non-invasive tests. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate in such patients the relationship between coronary atherosclerotic damage shown by angiography and MACE, during an average follow-up period of more than 5 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Coronary angiography was performed in 63 dialysis patients (mean age 56 Â± 12 years, 49 men); 37 subjects awaiting kidney transplantation had no history of cardiac disease, whereas the remaining 26 patients had clinical evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD). During a follow-up period of 62 Â± 20 months (range 12 - 109), all the MACE were recorded. Statistical analysis was carried out by dividing the patients into two groups, those who had MACE (MACE group) and those who were free of cardiac events (FCE group). Severe CAD on CA was defined as luminal stenosis â¥ 75 % in at least one vessel. Logistic regression analysis and Cox regression analysis were carried out in order to evaluate which variable was associated with MACE. RESULTS: At the end of follow-up, 17 subjects had MACE and severe CAD was shown in the epicardial arteries of 31 patients (49 %). Compared to the FCE group, the MACE group <b>had</b> <b>older</b> <b>age</b> (65 Â± 10 vs 53 Â± 11 years, P = 0. 002), lower diastolic blood pressure (79 Â± 7 vs 85 Â± 7 mmHg, P = 0. 0037), higher prevalence of CAD (82 vs 30 %, P = 0. 0002) and cerebrovascular disease (41 vs 15 %, P = 0. 0278). Coronary artery damage was higher in the MACE group than in the FCE group. Logistic and Cox regression analyses showed that age was the only variable independently associated with MACE (OR 1. 109 95 % CI 1. 022 - 1. 204, P = 0. 0133, hazard ratio 1. 066 95 % CI 1. 010 - 1. 125, P = 0. 02, respectively). After removal of age from the model, MACE were independently associated with haemodynamic stenosis of coronary arteries (OR 7. 429 95 % CI 1. 829 - 30. 173, P = 0. 005, hazard ratio 5. 992 95 % CI 1. 655 - 21. 698, P = 0. 006, respectively). Event-free survival was much better in the 37 renal transplant candidates with no history of CAD than in the 26 patients who had clinical evidence of CAD. CONCLUSIONS: This observational study confirms that in dialysis patients coronary atherosclerotic damage shown by angiography is strongly related to MACE and that age and severe CAD are major risk factors for MACE...|$|E
