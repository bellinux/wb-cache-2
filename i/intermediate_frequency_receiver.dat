Because of the use of CSD and multiplier block, the hardware resources can be greatly reduced. Using the system coefficients and wordlength information so obtained, a system for generating the corresponding VHDL codes was also developed. Automatic hardware synthesis is then employed to target the design to different platforms. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is evaluated by the realization of a digital <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>receiver</b> in field programmable gate arrays.

The zero <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>receiver</b> architecture has now become popular as it has both economic and size advantages over the traditional superheterodyne architecture. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a popular multi-carrier modulation technique {{with the ability to}} provide high data rates over echo ladened channels.

Unfortunately, OFDM is very sensitive to the carrier frequency offset (CFO) that is introduced by the downconversion process.

A blind CFO recovery algorithm based upon characteristics of the received signal's power spectrum is proposed. The algorithm's error performance is mathematically analyzed, and the theoretical results are verified with simulations. Simulation shows that the performance of the proposed algorithm agrees with the mathematical analysis. A number of other CFO recovery techniques are compared to the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm performs well in comparison and does not suffer from many of the disadvantages of existing blind CFO recovery techniques.

40|$|Introduction Digital <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Frequency</b> (IF) <b>receivers</b> are {{achieving}} a widespread use, also in satellite applications. By means of this paradigm the received RF spectrum is moved down to IF, and digitization {{occurs at the}} low IF. Thereafter, digital signal processing techniques are used to extract the signal.

In particular, a great deal of work has been carried out recently to study computationally feasible methods to reduce the sample rate before demodulation and detection [1], [2]. If we focus on timing recovery, conventional methods work with two or four samples per symbol, whether we talk of ad-hoc methods or we refer to maximum-likelihood based schemes [3], [4]. In any case, the number of samples per period is tried to keep at a minimum. The aim of this work is to analyze the timing recovery issue in IF-sampled systems, for whi...|$|R

As the technology scales and wireless standards become ever more challenging, the {{issues related to}} time-varying dc offsets, the second-order nonlinearity, and flicker noise become more critical. In this paper, we propose a new architecture of a superheterodyne RX that attempts to avoid such issues. By exploiting discrete-time (DT) operation and using only switches, capacitors, and inverter-based gm-stages as building blocks, the architecture becomes amenable to further scaling. Full integration is achieved by employing a cascade of four complex-valued passive switched-cap-based bandpass filters sampled at 4 × of the local oscillator rate that perform IF image rejection. Channel selection is achieved through an equivalent of the seventh-order filtering. A new twofold noise-canceling low-noise transconductance amplifier is proposed. Frequency domain analysis of the RX is presented by the proposed DT model. The RX is wideband and covers 0. 4 - 2. 9 GHz with a noise figure of 2. 9 - 4 dB.

40|$|Wireless {{communication}} forms nowadays a key technology. The trend here {{is obviously}} the growing digitalization of the circuits. At {{the same time}} the processing power expectations for mobile applications are increasing. The permanent race in the industry for the smallest process technology paves the way for these goals. On the other side there are numerous applications with a special attention on low power consumption and an economical implementation rather than a high clock frequency. In particular medical and sensor applications need power and area efficient radio systems. Here the production volumes are lower in comparison to portable radio or mobile communication applications. Thus for commercial reasons older CMOS technologies with moderate structural sizes are used. The low initial costs for these technologies makes low volumes economically feasible. An optimal receiver structure depends upon requirements of the communication standards. The high frequency input signal is mixed after a first amplification either directly into the baseband (homodyne) or it is processed on one or more <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequencies</b> (heterodyne). The complexity of the architecture and the circuit together with the costs, the power consumption and the ease of integration are the main decision criteria with the choice of the receiver structure. With further developments in circuit design technologies other receiver architectures became interesting, as well. In particular the homodyne receiver and the <b>receiver</b> with low <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency</b> (Low-IF <b>receiver)</b> experienced a far spreading in modern radio systems. The Low-IF receiver can be regarded as a middle course between the heterodyne and the homodyne architectures. Actually this receiver is heterodyne.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method of receiving of utilizable frequency bands. USE - Broadband low-intermediate frequency-dual-receiver e. g. high-precision such as dual receiver, global positioning system (GPS) -dual receiver, Galileo-dual-receiver, Glonass-dual receiver and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) -dual receiver, and single band-receiver, for receiving utilizable frequency bands {{in a field of}} a communication technology, for satellite-supported positioning, a position determining system and a navigation system e. g. GPS-satellite navigation system and Galileo-satellite navigation system. ADVANTAGE - The <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency</b> filter device filters the <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency</b> signals that are generated by the mixing device in an efficient manner. The receiver is designed in such a manner that only one frequency synthesizer is required to produce the local oscillator signals, thus enabling simultaneous receiving of the two utilizable frequency bands to save resources regarding switching cost and power consumption, and hence reducing the cost of resources...|$|R
