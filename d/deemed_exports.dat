40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "To protect its national security and foreign policy interests, the United States controls exports of civilian technologies that have military uses. U. S. firms {{may be required to}} obtain a license from the Department of Commerce before exporting these "dual-use" technologies from the United States to many other countries, including countries of concern. Since Commerce regulations also deem domestic transfers of controlled dual-use technologies to citizens of these countries to be exports, Commerce may require firms that employ foreign nationals working with these technologies in this country to obtain "deemed" export licenses. The firms should, in many cases, hold a deemed export license, and the foreign nationals should have an appropriate visa classification, such as an H- 1 B specialized employment classification. Commerce issues deemed export licenses to firms that employ or sponsor foreign nationals after consulting the Departments of Defense, State, and Energy. Deemed export licenses are generally valid for 2 years and comprise almost 10 percent of all export licenses approved by Commerce. In fiscal year 2001, Commerce approved 822 deemed export license applications and rejected 3. Most of the approved licenses allowed foreign nationals from countries of concern to work with advanced computer, electronic, or telecommunication and information security technologies in the United States. To better direct its efforts to detect possible unlicensed <b>deemed</b> <b>exports,</b> in fiscal year 2001 Commerce screened thousands of applications for H- 1 B and other types of visas submitted by foreign nationals overseas. From these applications, it developed 160 potential cases for follow-up by enforcement staff in the field. However, Commerce did not screen thousands of H- 1 B change-of-status applications submitted domestically to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for foreign nationals already in the United States. In addition, Commerce could not readily track the disposition of the 160 cases referred to field offices for follow-up because it lacks a system for doing so. Commerce attaches security conditions to almost all licenses to mitigate the risk of providing foreign nationals with controlled dual-use technologies. However, according to senior Commerce officials, Commerce staff do not regularly visit forms to determine whether these conditions are being implemented because of competing priorities, resource constraints, and inherent difficulties in enforcing several conditions. ...|$|E

40|$|The federal <b>deemed</b> <b>export</b> rules {{prohibit}} {{certain individuals}} from receiving {{any information about}} certain technologies without the required license, even if those individuals are otherwise authorized {{to work within the}} United States. In other words, employers who deal with technology or software subject to export control may be considered to be illegally exporting such technology or software, simply by allowing certain foreign nationals to work with or gain information about the restricted items. This article will attempt two moderately simple tasks and one more difficult. The first task is to identify the tensions that exist between the <b>deemed</b> <b>export</b> rules and the federal anti-discrimination statutes, creating awareness about potential issues that might arise if employers use general human resources advice, while neglecting <b>deemed</b> <b>export</b> requirements. Second, the article will attempt to demonstrate how employers who want to become involved in the complex <b>deemed</b> <b>export</b> regime can do so, consistent with the federal anti-discrimination statutes. While concern exists that employers complying with the <b>deemed</b> <b>export</b> rules may be placing themselves in violation of Title VII and IRCA, this article argues that, in most cases, employment screenings for <b>deemed</b> <b>export</b> requirements should not yield liability under either Title VII or IRCA. The third task is more complex. To comply with <b>deemed</b> <b>export</b> law, an employer must obtain an employee-specific export license prior to making the restricted technology available to the foreign national. The required licenses often take months to obtain, and, it may be difficult or impossible for employers to obtain such licenses for certain employees. To comply with the <b>deemed</b> <b>export</b> requirements in a hiring or promotion context, the employer would be required to limit an employee 2 ̆ 7 s job responsibilities to non-export controlled work or to place the foreign national employee on unpaid leave until the government made its decision on whether to issue the license. This places the employer in the position of leaving certain tasks unperformed or requiring other employees to take on additional job responsibilities during the interim, causing project delays. Once an employer becomes involved in the <b>deemed</b> <b>export</b> regime, it has responsibilities to ensure that the employee 2 ̆ 7 s access to technology remains within the granted license and that all of the conditions of the license continue to be met. This article argues that, consistent with the federal anti-discrimination statutes, employers should be able, in certain instances, to choose not to hire, assign, or promote certain foreign nationals, simply because to do so would trigger the employer 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in the legally perilous, complex, and uncertain <b>deemed</b> <b>export</b> regime. Additionally, the article argues that employers should be allowed to engage in a cost-benefit analysis regarding whether the value added by particular job positions merits involvement with the <b>deemed</b> <b>export</b> regime. To be clear, this article does not advocate that all employers begin to consider national origin or country of citizenship when hiring. Nor does it advocate that an employer should {{be able to use the}} <b>deemed</b> <b>export</b> rules as a pretext for discrimination based on national origin or citizenship. Rather, the article demonstrates that neither Title VII nor IRCA prohibit an employer from refusing to hire an individual, if the reason for that decision is a desire to avoid becoming involved in the <b>deemed</b> <b>export</b> regime...|$|R

40|$|Plastic is an {{engineered}} material used {{to manufacture}} {{a wide variety}} of products to meet the domestic demand in Bangladesh as well as some products are exported. The plastic industry has emerged as an important industrial sector in the country during the last two decades. At present there are 3000 plastic manufacturing units, 98 % of which belong to the Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Domestic market size is Tk 7, 000 crore. Per capita consumption of plastics in Bangladesh is 5 kg per year. The plastic sector constitutes 1. 0 of GDP and provides employment for half a million people. Total export earning for both direct and <b>deem</b> (RMG accessories) <b>exports</b> is about US $ 337 million. An in-depth study of the plastic sector reveals multi-dimensional constraints and an excellent prospect for future growth. Major constraint in the plastic sector is the lack of an institutional arrangement dedicated to this sector, in order to provide supporting services such as skilled manpower, testing facilities for quality control, innovative technology and consultancy services. The availability of cheap labor and the fast developing plastic wastes recycling industry due to rising cost of petroleum (raw material of polymers) provide Bangladesh potential advantage of competitiveness in the global market...|$|R
40|$|The term export cartels denotes {{agreements}} between companies {{operating in the}} same industry which aim at restricting (or even eliminating) mutual competition in export of the goods (or services) offered on one or more foreign markets. Such dealings are coordinated between independent companies and replace their unconstrained decisions on export of goods or services to foreign markets with an arrangements on prices, production volume or other business parameters. Not all cooperation {{agreements between}} exporters can be <b>deemed</b> to involve <b>export</b> cartel definition. Furthermore, not all export cartels are detrimental per se or even {{from the standpoint of}} importing country. Increased productivity and competition-friendly impact on the export in the source country may also prove beneficial for the consumers of the importing country. This is notably true of the cartels of innovative character that aim at research and development cooperation (R&D cartels). However some forms of cartelizing, both domestic and exporting, bring about particularly negative consequences for the operation of markets (the so-called „hardcore cartels”). The paper examines different forms of the various cartels, presents their typology and analyzes their activities worldwide, providing examples of their operations on the world market. It also explains the rationale behind their establishment and consequences of their operation from the standpoint of competition regulations...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the vast deposit of {{resources}} and human endowments in ECOWAS region, gains from trade have really been marginal in the region. ECOWAS members have poor performance in export of dynamic products; they remained commodity dependent in its exports, leading to transfer of economic gains across border. Over 90 % of the region’s export is primary products with very little value-added which accentuated from commodity price and demand inelasticity resulting in terms of trade losses and volatile foreign earnings. Based on these facts, the study tries to investigate the impact of export diversification and composition on GDP growth and GDP per capita respectively. This was achieved using econometric analyses involving co-integration technique and a panel least square technique {{for the period of}} 1975 - 2009 and 1990 - 2007 respectively in 15 ECOWAS states. The study was <b>deemed</b> significant, as <b>export</b> diversification and manufacturing value-added index induced a positive and significant impact on per capita income growth. The study found high skewness of ECOWAS to commodity export in the period observed but a vertical diversification of product base would emanates more spill-over and surplus gains from the regions endowments. The conclusive finding centred on that fact that it is not how much that is exported that matters but very important is what is exported as regions with less specialization and more diversified exports generally experienced higher economic growth rates and contributed much more to overall exports. Notable recommendation for ECOWAS policy makers is the need to develop domestic processing capability and see export as originating from domestic sufficiency. ...|$|R
