40|$|To {{study the}} {{influence}} of pick working angles on cutting performance of auger miner’s aiguille, aiguilles with different pick working angles were developed and their performance were tested on coal cutting test-bed. Cutting performance evaluation system of the aiguille was established first, and then evaluation indexes such as average load, load fluctuation coefficient, and specific energy were analyzed by statistical method. The research indicates that the torque and specific energy of the aiguille decrease first and then increase with increased pick working angles. The <b>feed</b> <b>resistance</b> decreases {{with the increase in}} two working angles. The energy consumed by the <b>feed</b> <b>resistance</b> is very small relative to the total energy and can be ignored.

40|$|Introduction: The Post-traumatic Feeding Disorder {{has been}} {{introduced}} to define clinical evidence characterized by intense anticipatory anxiety of the child {{at the sight of}} food and great distress if the child is encouraged to eat by the caregiver; these children often show clinical history of actual unpleasant events namely of highly food or oral traumatic experiences due to medical treatments. Objective: To identify variables and interactive features of the maternal and child psychological profile in the context of some types of feeding disorders: Post-Traumatic Feeding Disorder, Infantile Anorexia and Food Sensory Aversions. Methodology: Sample: The sample consisted of 80 mother-infant dyads (age range of children: 17 - 36 months). Tools and procedures: Observing mother-child interaction during feeding was assessed using the following coding systems: Feeding Scale and <b>Feeding</b> <b>Resistance</b> Scale. The mother's psychological profile was assessed through the Psychiatric Symptom Checklist and Eating Attitude Test. The psychological profile of the child was assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist 1 ½- 5. Results: Interactive variables: There were significant differences between all clinical groups examined and the control group to scores of Feeding Scale. In particular, children with Posttraumatic Feeding Disorder obtained higher average scores in all dimensions of <b>Feeding</b> <b>Resistance</b> Scale. Risk indicators in the psychological functioning of mothers: mothers of children with Post-traumatic Eating Disorder get average scores higher anxiety than mothers of children with Infantile Anorexia. Risk indicators in the psychological functioning of children: Children with Post-traumatic Feeding Disorder obtained higher average scores in Externalizing syndromes (aggressive behavior) than other clinical groups and control. Discussion and Conclusions: The results of our study confirm the specific clinical features of emotional dysregulation in children with Post-traumatic Feeding Disorder and the interconnections between psychological of mothers' and children's profile...|$|R
40|$|A recent {{increase}} in the number of belt feeder downtime events at the Client’s sites and a changing economic environment has prompted the need for a better understanding of belt feeder resistance loads occurring at site. A better understanding of the loads actually occurring at site will be used to make recommendations on how the current design process could be improved. The Bruff and TUNRA methods currently used for belt feeder design were reviewed and used to predict the pressure of the belt feeder hydraulic drive system for a range of initial fill bin levels. Trials were then carried out at one of the Client’s iron ore sites to verify these design predictions over a range of bin levels. The results of the trial indicate that the current design methods significantly over-predict belt <b>feed</b> <b>resistance.</b> These prediction methods also fail to predict the relationship between initial start-up pull out force and initial fill bin level. The results suggest that an arched stress field is partially formed in the hopper during the filling process resulting in significantly lower initial pull-out forces. This implies that a smaller drive system could have been used for this particular application, potentially resulting in significantly reduced installation costs. The results do not, however, provide enough evidence to be able to confidently state that the pull-out force on a belt feeder in a different application would also be significantly less than the TUNRA prediction. Further trials need to be done, and the results from this project have shown that further investigation is warranted...|$|E
40|$|Colletotrichum sublineola is an {{aggressive}} fungal pathogen that causes anthracnose in sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]. The obvious symptoms of anthracnose are leaf blight and stem rot. Sorghum, the fifth most widely grown cereal crop in the world, {{can be highly}} susceptible to the disease, most notably in hot and humid environments. In the southeastern United States the acreage of sorghum has been increasing steadily in recent years, spurred by growing interest in producing biofuels, bio-based products, and animal <b>feed.</b> <b>Resistance</b> to anthracnose is, therefore, of paramount importance for successful sorghum production in this region. To identify anthracnose resistance loci present in the highly resistant cultivar ‘Bk 7 ’, a biparental mapping population of F 3 : 4 and F 4 : 5 sorghum lines was generated by crossing ‘Bk 7 ’ with the susceptible inbred ‘Early Hegari-Sart’. Lines were phenotyped in three environments and in two different years following natural infection. The population was genotyped by sequencing. Following a stringent custom filtering protocol, totals of 5186 and 2759 informative SNP markers were identified in the two populations. Segregation data and association analysis identified resistance loci on chromosomes  7 and 9, with the resistance alleles derived from ‘Bk 7 ’. Both loci contain multiple classes of defense-related genes based on sequence similarity and gene ontologies. Genetic analysis following an independent selection experiment of lines derived from a cross between ‘Bk 7 ’ and sweet sorghum ‘Mer 81 - 4 ’ narrowed the resistance locus on chromosome  9 substantially, validating this QTL. As observed in other species, sorghum appears to have regions of clustered resistance genes. Further characterization of these regions will facilitate the development of novel germplasm with resistance to anthracnose and other diseases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Environmental {{transmission}} of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and resistance gene determinants originating from livestock {{is affected by}} their persistence in agricultural-related matrices. This study investigated the effects of administering subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials to beef cattle on the abundance and persistence of resistance genes within the microbial community of fecal deposits. Cattle (three pens per treatment, 10 steers per pen) were administered chlortetracycline, chlortetracycline plus sulfamethazine, tylosin, or no antimicrobials (control). Model fecal deposits (n = 3) were prepared by mixing fresh feces from each pen into a single composite sample. Real-time PCR {{was used to measure}} concentrations of tet, sul and erm resistance genes in DNA extracted from composites over 175 days of environmental exposure in the field. The microbial communities were analyzed by quantification and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified 16 S-rRNA. Results The concentrations of 16 S-rRNA in feces were similar across treatments and increased by day 56, declining thereafter. DGGE profiles of 16 S-rRNA differed amongst treatments and with time, illustrating temporal shifts in microbial communities. All measured resistance gene determinants were quantifiable in feces after 175 days. Antimicrobial treatment differentially affected the abundance of certain resistance genes but generally not their persistence. In the first 56 days, concentrations of tet (B), tet (C), sul 1, sul 2, erm (A) tended to increase, and decline thereafter, whereas tet (M) and tet (W) gradually declined over 175 days. At day 7, the concentration of erm (X) was greatest in feces from cattle fed tylosin, compared to all other treatments. Conclusion The abundance of genes coding for antimicrobial resistance in bovine feces can be affected by inclusion of antibiotics in the <b>feed.</b> <b>Resistance</b> genes can persist in feces from cattle beyond 175 days with concentrations of some genes increasing with time. Management practices that accelerate DNA degradation such as frequent land application or composting of manure may reduce the extent to which bovine feces serves as a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{excitation}} current intensity on the mechanical properties of ZL 205 A castings solidified under a traveling magnetic field was studied. The {{results of the}} experiment indicate that the excitation current intensity of the traveling magnetic field has a great influence on the mechanical properties of the ZL 205 A castings. When the excitation current intensity is 15 A, the tensile strength and elongation of ZL 205 A alloy castings increase 27. 2 % and 67. 7 %, respectively, {{compared with those of}} the same alloy solidified under gravity. The improvement of mechanical properties is attributed to the decrease of micro-porosity in the alloy. Under the traveling magnetic field, the feeding pressure in the alloy melt before solidification can be enhanced due to the electromagnetic force. Moreover, the melt flow induced by the traveling magnetic field can decrease the temperature gradient. The <b>feeding</b> <b>resistance</b> will be increased because the temperature gradient decrease. So traveling magnetic field has an optimum effect on feeding...|$|R

However, while many studies on terrestrial plants identified eliciting signals and the response cascade to resistance, the knowledge on inducible marine macroalgal defense is lagging far behind and is often restricted to the mere recognition of its presence. This study is the first to accurately quantify the temporal dynamics, i. e. the time lag of induction and relaxation, of antifeeding defense in a marine macroalga, Fucus vesiculosus, from the Baltic Sea. Time lag of induction and reduction of induced <b>feeding</b> <b>resistance</b> were assessed via feeding assays, because the identities of defensive compounds are still unknown. Our results demonstrate that F vesiculosus induced defense 10 - 14 days after the onset of grazing by the isopod Idotea baltica. Defenses were relaxed within 2 - 4 days after cessation of grazing. Thus, defense seems to be deployed sparingly and just long enough to avoid substantial loss of tissue. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Plants {{respond to}} {{herbivory}} with the induction of resistance, mediated by distinct phytohormonal signaling pathways and their interactions. Phloem feeders {{are known to}} induce plant resistance via the salicylic acid pathway, whereas biting-chewing herbivores induce plant resistance mainly via the jasmonate pathway. Here, we show that a specialist caterpillar (biting-chewing herbivore) and a specialist aphid (phloem feeder) differentially induce resistance against Pieris brassicae caterpillars in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. Caterpillar <b>feeding</b> induces <b>resistance</b> through the jasmonate signaling pathway {{that is associated with}} the induction of kaempferol 3, 7 -dirhamnoside, whereas aphid <b>feeding</b> induces <b>resistance</b> via a novel mechanism involving sinapoyl malate. The role of sinapoyl malate is confirmed {{through the use of a}} mutant compromised in the biosynthesis of this compound. Caterpillar-induced resistance is associated with a lower cost in terms of plant growth reduction than aphid-induced resistance. A strong constitutive resistance against P. brassicae caterpillars in combination with a strong growth attenuation in plants of a transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion mutant of WRKY 70 (wrky 70) suggest that the WRKY 70 transcription factor, a regulator of downstream responses mediated by jasmonate-salicylic acid signaling cross talk, is involved in the negative regulation of caterpillar resistance and in the tradeoff between growth and defense. In conclusion, different mechanisms of herbivore-induced resistance come with different costs, and a functional WRKY 70 transcription factor is required for the induction of low-cost resistance...|$|R

50|$|The {{study of}} rabbit {{genetics}} is mainly due to medical researchers, fanciers, and the fur and meat industries. Each {{of these groups}} have differing interests and needs for genetic information. In biomedical research community and pharmaceutical industry, rabbits are used to produce antibodies, test toxicity of consumer products, and as a model organism. Among rabbit fanciers, the fiber/fur industry, the genetics of coat color and hair properties are paramount. The meat industry selects for disease <b>resistance,</b> <b>feed</b> conversion ratio, and reproduction potential.|$|R
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether there is a differential stimulation of the contractile myofibrillar and the cellular sarcoplasmic proteins after ingestion of protein and how this is affected by resistance exercise. Fasted (FAST) muscle protein synthesis was measured in seven healthy young men with a primed constant infusion of l-[ring- 13 C 6]phenylalanine. Participants then performed an intense bout of unilateral resistance exercise followed by the consumption of 25 g of whey protein to maximally stimulate protein synthesis. In the rested (FED) leg myofibrillar (MYO) protein synthesis was elevated (P 0. 05). In contrast, MYO protein synthesis in the exercised (FED-EX) leg was stimulated above FAST at 1, 3 and 5 h (∼ 100, 216, and 229 %, respectively; P < 0. 01) with the increase at 5 h being greater than FED (P < 0. 01). Thus, the synthesis of muscle contractile proteins is stimulated by both <b>feeding</b> and <b>resistance</b> exercise early (1 h) but has a greater duration and amplitude after resistance exercise. Sarcoplasmic (SARC) protein synthesis was similarly elevated (P < 0. 01) above FAST by ∼ 104 % at 3 h in both FED and FED-EX suggesting SARC protein synthesis is stimulated by feeding but that this response is not augmented by resistance exercise. In conclusion, myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic protein synthesis are similarly, but transiently, stimulated with protein <b>feeding.</b> In contrast, <b>resistance</b> exercise rapidly stimulates and sustains the synthesis of only the myofibrillar protein fraction after protein ingestion. These data highlight the importance of measuring the synthetic response of specific muscle protein fractions when examining the effects of exercise and nutrition...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{ventilation}} {{and respiratory}} mechanics were made {{before and after}} tube feeding in 24 infants. In 12 infants with the respiratory distresssyndrome tidal volume tended to fall after feeding; as the respiratory rate increased after feeding; as the respiratory rate increased after feeding, minute ventilation remained unchanged. Hypoventilation is therefore unlikely to {{be the cause of}} hypoxaemia after <b>feeding.</b> Compliance, <b>resistance,</b> and the work of breathing showed no changes after feeding. In 12 healthy infants feeding had no effects on pulmonary function. There was a slight rise in compliance and a tendency for work of breathing to fall after feeding. Respiratory rate, tidal volume, and minute ventilation remained unchanged. There was therefore no evidence of adverse effects of feeding on any of the factors measured. It is suggested that hypoxaemia without hypoventilation after feeding in infants with pre-existing respiratory distress syndrome might be attributable to a reduction in functional residual capacity associated with a greater extent of airways closure than before feeding...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} thirty years, the Single European Market (SEM) has been the core {{business}} of the European Union, and enormous progress has been achieved in both ‘widening’ the economic activities covered by EU legislation and ‘deepening’ the acquis to overcome emerging gaps in integration in areas already covered by legislation. And yet, empirical evidence indicates that market integration has stalled on many fronts and, more importantly, that the expected economic benefits from integration in terms of higher growth of incomes, jobs, and productivity have fallen short of expectations, notably in the long-established EU- 15 member states. The situation has not improved after {{the introduction of the}} euro. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review the main developments in SEM legislation and regulatory activities over the past three decades; summarize the results of the SEM programme in market integration, highlighting the areas where gaps appear more important; and discuss the impact of economic integration within the SEM, including aspects that play an important role in <b>feeding</b> popular <b>resistance</b> to integration...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—High-fat diets (HFDs) {{are known}} to induce in-sulin resistance. Previously, we showed that 3, 5 -diiodothyronine (T 2), {{concomitantly}} administered to rats on a 4 -week HFD, pre-vented gain in body weight and adipose mass. Here we investi-gated whether and how T 2 prevented HFD-induced insulin resistance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—We investigated the biochemical targets of T 2 related to lipid and glucose homeosta-sis over time using various techniques, including genomic and proteomic profiling, immunoblotting, transient transfection, and enzyme activity analysis. RESULTS—Here we show that, in rats, HFD <b>feeding</b> induced insulin <b>resistance</b> (as expected), whereas T 2 administration prevented its onset. T 2 did so by rapidly stimulating hepatic fatty acid oxidation, decreasing hepatic triglyceride levels, an...|$|R
40|$|Skeletal {{muscle is}} {{critical}} for human health. Protein <b>feeding,</b> alongside <b>resistance</b> exercise, is a potent stimulus for muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and is a key factor that regulates skeletal muscle mass (SMM). The main purpose of this narrative review was to evaluate the latest evidence for optimising the amino acid or protein source, dose, timing, pattern and macronutrient coingestion for increasing or preserving SMM in healthy young and healthy older adults. We used a systematic search strategy of PubMed and Web of Science to retrieve all articles related to this review objective. In summary, our findings {{support the notion that}} protein guidelines for increasing or preserving SMM are more complex than simply recommending a total daily amount of protein. Instead, multifactorial interactions between protein source, dose, timing, pattern and macronutrient coingestion, alongside exercise, influence the stimulation of MPS, and thus should be considered in the context of protein recommendations for regulating SMM. To conclude, on the basis of currently available scientific literature, protein recommendations for optimising SMM should be tailored to the population or context of interest, with consideration given to age and resting/post resistance exercise conditions...|$|R
40|$|Hemangiomas are {{the most}} common tumors of skin and soft tissues in children. In recent years, the number of {{patients}} suffering hemangiomas becomes increasing. Aim: to evaluate the efficacy of non-selective (3 -blockers in treatment of hemangiomas in infants with short duration of the disease. Materials and methods. Propranolol, a non-selective (3 -blocker, was chosen as a medication. Observed group was composed of 5 infants aged 1 year. Starting dosage of propranolol was 2 - 4 mg, with hemodynamic parameters being controlled before and after the drug administration. Target dosage was 2. 0 - 2. 5 mg/kg. Results. All children had a distinct clinical improvement after 1 week of propranolol treatment. In 4 infants Doppler mode ultrasound scan of hemangiomas demonstrated the hollowing of a <b>feeding</b> vessel. <b>Resistance</b> index was reduced in 4 infants. Shrinking of hemangiomas was stated in 2 infants during ultrasound scanning. All infants continue to be observed by surgeons and pediatricians. The drug is well-tolerated. Adverse effects during the treatment with propranolol have not be noticed, both during the in-patient and out-patient phase. Conclusion. Using propranolol as the first-line drug opens new possibilities in the conservative therapy of hemangiomas when surgical intervention is not possible...|$|R

The resistant strain developed faster and had increased survival on Bt maize {{relative to a}} susceptible strain. Results from reciprocal crosses of the resistant and susceptible strains indicated that inheritance of resistance was nonrecessive. No fitness costs were associated with resistance alleles {{in the presence of}} two entomopathogenic nematode species, Steinernema carpocapsae Weiser and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar.

40|$|The cJun NH(2) -terminal kinase isoform JNK 1 is {{implicated in}} the {{mechanism}} of obesity-induced insulin <b>resistance.</b> <b>Feeding</b> a high-fat diet causes activation of the JNK 1 signaling pathway, insulin resistance, and obesity in mice.

Emerging research indicates that JNK 1 plays multiple roles in the regulation of insulin resistance, including altered gene expression, hormone/cytokine production, and lipid metabolism. Together, these studies establish JNK 1 as a potential pharmacological target for the development of drugs that might be useful for the treatment of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cross-contamination of feed {{with low}} {{concentrations}} of antimicrobials can occur at production, transport and/or farm level. Concerns are rising about possible {{effects of this}} contaminated <b>feed</b> on <b>resistance</b> selection in the intestinal microbiota. Therefore, an experiment with pigs was set up, in which intestinal and fecal concentrations of chlortetracycline (CTC), doxycycline (DOX) and sulfadiazine-trimethoprim (SDZ-TRIM) were determined after administration of feed containing a 3 % carry-over level of these antimicrobials. Results: The poor oral bioavailability of tetracyclines resulted in rather high concentrations in cecal and colonic content and feces at steady-state conditions. A mean concentration of 10 mg/kg CTC and 4 mg/kg DOX in the feces was reached, which is higher than concentrations that were shown to cause resistance selection. On the other hand, lower mean levels of SDZ (0. 7 mg/kg) and TRIM (< limit of detection of 0. 016 mg/kg) {{were found in the}} feces, corresponding with the high oral bioavailability of SDZ and TRIM in pigs. Conclusions: The relation between the oral bioavailability and intestinal concentrations of the tested antimicrobials, may be of help in assessing the risks of cross-contaminated feed. However, future research is needed to confirm our results and to evaluate the effects of these detected concentrations on resistance selection in the intestinal microbiota of pigs...|$|R
