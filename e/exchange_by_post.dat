Its website claimed to sell Manchukuo postage stamps, but when a Ming Pao columnist enquired with them about the possibility of purchasing them, a spokesperson stated that the items were sold out. It also issued what it referred to as [...] "loyalty bonds". Its activities led the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, Greece's Hellenic Capital Market Commission, and Spain's Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores to issue public warnings about it in February 2008 to emphasise {{that it is not a}} body permitted to offer investment services.|$|R
50|$|Employees of the Cuban {{state and}} of state {{enterprises}} are paid their basic salary in CUP, with some paid a performance-dependent bonus in CUC. Staple {{goods and services}} not oriented towards foreigners are usually paid in CUP. 'Luxury' goods and services, including most imported goods and anything intended for consumption by foreigners, are generally paid for in CUC. Since around 2014, most state shops which previously accepted only CUC have accepted either currency, with <b>exchange</b> charts <b>posted</b> <b>by</b> the tills.

40|$|We study {{models that}} combine search, {{monetary}} <b>exchange,</b> price <b>posting</b> <b>by</b> sellers, and buyers with preferences that differ across random meetings - say, because sellers in different meetings produce different varieties {{of the same}} good. We show how these features interact to influence the price level (i. e., the value of money) and price dispersion. First, price-posting equilibria exist with valued fiat currency, which is not true in the standard model. Second, although both are possible, price dispersion is more common than a single price. Third, perhaps surprisingly, we prove generically there cannot be more than two prices in equilibrium. Money; Price levels...|$|R

In addition, students’, teachers’ and course coordinators’ perceptions about the discussion forum as an activity in an e-learning environment that can successfully contribute to FPEL curriculum writing and study skills goals and teaching approaches were examined with regard to the attainment of learning outcomes (LOs). Data were collected by interviewing teachers and course coordinators, conducting an online survey for students, monitoring students’ participation in forum activities and analyzing the policy documents related to writing and study skills components of FPEL 0560 course. The results of the study corroborate some significant findings of the previous work in the field, and clearly demonstrate that Moodle forums support writing fluency, allow students more time for developing ideas and working on their writing and study skills’ assignments. Additionally, forums foster a sense of purpose and community, as well as contribute to communication skills’ development of language learners through online language learning environment by responding to online assignments, inviting feedback, commenting on/grading other students’ comments, seeking and providing help with purposes of enhancing, reinforcing and researching...|$|R
