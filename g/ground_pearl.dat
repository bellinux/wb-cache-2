50|$|The Margarodidae {{or ground}} pearls (cottony cushion scales, giant coccids, giant scale insects) are {{a family of}} scale insects within the {{superfamily}} Coccoidea. Members of the family include the Polish cochineal and Armenian cochineal (genus Porphyrophora) and the original <b>ground</b> <b>pearl</b> genus, Margarodes. Beginning in 1880, a number of distinct subfamilies were recognized, with the giant coccis (the Monophlebidae) being the first. Although Maskell proposed a new family, many continued to regard the monophlebids as a mere subfamily for many years, and the Margarodidae classification continued to be polyphyletic through the 20th Century. Since then, taking the advice of Koteja several subfamilies and tribes have been elevated into their own families such as Matsucoccidae and Xylococcidae. The pared-down family of Margarodidae (Margarodidae sensu stricto or Margarodidae s. s.) is monophyletic.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the technical viability substitution of corn by Pearl Millet in an isometrics way for growing pigs rations, it was carried out at the Animal Science Department of the University of Lavras (UFLA) two metabolism assays and one performance trial. The metabolism assays were conducted by utilizing 12 crossbred (LD x LW) barrows (31. 80 ± 2. 20 kg/BW) for the feed stuffs (ground corn, <b>ground</b> <b>pearl</b> millet and whole grain) and 10 barrows (42. 10 ± 2. 10 kg/BW) for rations with 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % substitution of corn by <b>ground</b> <b>pearl</b> millet. The pigs were distributed in metabolism cages. The experiment was in a completely randomized block design and the evaluation period was used as split-plots. A total feces collection and oxide ferric as a marker were used in both metabolism assays. A total of 120 crossbred (LD x LW) barrows and gilts with an average weight of 30. 69 ± 1. 2 kg/BW, were utilized in the performance trial. The experiment was in a randomized block design, with five treatments and twelve replicates, the experimental unit was represented by pens with two pigs (1 barrows and 1 gilt). The metabolism data from both <b>ground</b> <b>pearl</b> millet and whole showed no significant differences (P> 0. 05) for apparent digestibility of nutrients as well as energetic values. In average, the DDM, ADCP, DP, DE and ME of pearl millet were 87. 14 %; 86. 25 %; 11. 49 %; 3166 kcal kg- 1 and 3040 kcal kg- 1, respectively. The substitution of <b>ground</b> <b>pearl</b> millet at maximum 100 % showed no significant differences (P> 0. 05) on the digestibility coefficients of Crude Protein and Nitrogen Retention.

40|$|A {{principal}} praga da videira no Brasil, Eurhizococcus brasiliensis, tem dificultado o cultivo, não só pelos danos causados e falta de controle eficaz, mas principalmente pela falta de informações sobre a interação com a videira. Existem várias hipóteses de como a pérola-da-terra mata uma videira, mas até o momento nenhuma teoria pôde ser comprovada. Com o objetivo de avançar no conhecimento da interação pérola-da-terra x videira, avaliou-se a anatomia de ninfas e tecidos radiciais infestados, comparou-se o desenvolvimento vegetativo e a fisiologia de plantas sadias e infestadas, desenvolvendo-se análises nas fases de viveiro e vinhedo adulto. Para melhor monitorar as alterações ocasionadas, as avaliações envolvendo tecidos foliares de plantas infestadas, foram subdivididas em folhas assintomáticas, cloróticas e necróticas. Observou-se até 3 estiletes em ninfas de pérola-da-terra e estes podem medir duas vezes o tamanho do corpo da pérola-da-terra. Na sua fase adulta a pérola-da-terra pode formar uma carapaça protetora, onde se percebe uma proliferação de tecido parenquimático na base, resultante de um meristema lateral reativo à presença do inseto. Contudo, a parte superior e principal da cápsula, que recobre a cochonilha é formada por uma secreção, possivelmente polissacarídica e protéica, de origem não vegetal. No segundo ano de cultivo no viveiro a pérola-da-terra reduziu drasticamente o desenvolvimento vegetativo de mudas da cv. Cabernet Sauvignon (Vitis vinifera). Em plantas adultas da cv.

With the aim of advancing the knowledge of the interaction between the <b>ground</b> <b>pearl</b> x grapevine, the present work was evaluated the anatomy of the nymphs and the infested root tissues and compared the healthy and infested plants growing at the initial and the adult stages. In order to monitor the effects in leaves, leaves tissues from infested plants were subdivided into nonsymptomatic, with chlorosis and with necrosis leaves.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>ground</b> <b>pearl,</b> Eurhizococcus brasiliensis, is {{considered}} an important pest of vineyards in southern Brazil, with affected plants exhibiting leaf chlorosis, reduction in vigor, fading, and death. This study evaluated the quality of hardwood cuttings produced from plants infected (I) and not infected (NI) by <b>ground</b> <b>pearl.</b> 'Paulsen 1103 ' (Vitis berlandieri × Vitis rupestris) plants were grown for 29 months in brick-built raised beds either infested or not infested by ground pearl; then, 12 one-year-old branches with a maximum of 12 buds each were cut from each plant, subdivided into three portions (4 buds cutting- 1), and subjected to destructive and nondestructive testing. DDestructive testing comprised determining fresh and dry weight, length, internode diameters, and percentage of starch. Nondestructive testing comprised assessing the potential for bud sprouting and shoot development. Each mother plant in the I and NI beds was considered a replicate, {{with a total of}} 360 cuttings per treatment. It was observed that cuttings from infected plants had significantly lower (P< 0. 05) internode diameter, length, and fresh and dry weight than those of the uninfected plants. The percentage of starch content of the cuttings did not differ significantly. All cuttings showed the same percentage (100 %) of bud breaking and no changes in growth and development of seedlings regardless of source.

O experimento foi instalado em área naturalmente infestada pela praga, avaliando-se a resistência dos genótiposmediante a contagem do número de insetos presentes nas raízes, peso seco das plantas (parte aérea + raízes) e mortalidade após três anos. Todas as cultivares de V. rotundifolia apresentaram baixo índice de infestação pela pérola-da-terra, maior vigor e menor mortalidade quando comparadas ao porta-enxerto 101 - 14.
