500|$|Malone {{credited}} Howarth's versatility {{with the}} reason he was cast as Todd. [...] During a February 1993 interview with Soap Opera Digest (SOD), Howarth stated he was surprised he won the part. [...] "I really don't know how I made it," [...] he said. He met a One Life to Live casting director two years previously, while performing in a New York play, but, when the role of Todd opened up, he [...] "auditioned <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> else". He [...] "made it to callbacks, and [...] got the part". Howarth said, [...] "I was hired... to plant drugs in Jason Webb's jacket. All I knew was that my first name was Todd. I don't know what happened next. They called me in again and suddenly I had a last name 'Manning.' Then I get called to read another day." ...|$|E

[...] "Between Andrea Dworkin and Kitty MacKinnon, they've written so many books, and they mention my name and all that, but financially they've never helped me out. When I showed up with them for {{speaking}} engagements, I'd always get five hundred dollars or so. But I know they made a few bucks off me, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> else."

5000|$|In {{light of}} Bereman's {{decision}} not to field a team, TeamTennis decided before the season {{that no matter what}} record the Loves posted, they would be placed last among the eight teams in the standings. The players were paid a salary instead of being eligible for prize money based on their performance. However, their matches counted in the records of the other seven teams. The Loves' first match was a loss to the eventual 1983 champion Chicago Fyre on July 20. Player-coach Syd Ball said, [...] "It's unfortunate we can't play any home matches. But we knew before we hit a ball in Chicago what the situation was. We accepted the fact we won't share in the prize money. We're looking at it as a good workout session that will stand us in good stead in any tournaments coming up. We have a compact little program. We haven't had any wins yet, but we had a super tiebreaker against Dallas. We <b>just</b> <b>like</b> spoiling <b>everybody</b> else's record." ...|$|R
2500|$|Critics have disputed Ehrlich's main thesis about {{overpopulation}} and {{its effects}} on the environment and human society, and his solutions, {{as well as some of}} his specific predictions made since the late 1960s. One criticism concerns Ehrlich's allegedly alarmist and sensational statements and inaccurate [...] "predictions". Ronald Bailey of Reason Magazine has termed him an [...] "irrepressible doomster... who, as far as I can tell, has never been right in any of his forecasts of imminent catastrophe." [...] On the first Earth Day in 1970, he warned that [...] "n ten years all important animal life in the sea will be extinct. Large areas of coastline will have to be evacuated because of the stench of dead fish." [...] In a 1971 speech, he predicted that: [...] "By the year 2000 the United Kingdom will be simply a small group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million hungry people." [...] "If I were a gambler," [...] Professor Ehrlich concluded before boarding an airplane, [...] " [...] I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000." [...] When this scenario did not occur, he responded that [...] "When you predict the future, you get things wrong. How wrong is another question. I would have lost if I had had taken the bet. However, if you look closely at England, what can I tell you? They're having all kinds of problems, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> else." [...] Ehrlich wrote in The Population Bomb that, [...] "India couldn't possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980." ...|$|E

30|$|This {{model of}} {{interaction}} is enforced by Government decree No. 218, which stipulates {{the creation of}} research maps for every state corporation and requires them to provide funding for universities in accordance with these roadmaps. In a case whereas sellable product is the outcome of such collaborations, the state promised to reimburse expenses incurred by the corporations concerned. The State can co-finance the joint R&D projects of the universities and companies in a ratio of 1 : 1, so {{that means that the}} government can provide a subsidy equal to the sum the company spends on this project. At this juncture, the business often invests into the projects their assets rather than ready money: ‘The government themselves understand that nobody is going to put out forty million rubles <b>just</b> <b>like</b> that, <b>everybody</b> shows everything they can find - depreciation of equipment, intellectual property and whatever … And the main idea is that the State provides the university with money and they go through with the development [together with the company - authors] and later with the commercialization’l.|$|R
5000|$|Anya's irrational fear of rabbits (leporiphobia) is {{established}} {{for the first time}} in the Season Four Halloween episode [...] "Fear, Itself", in which she appears in a bunny costume after Xander tells her to come to the party as something [...] "scary". Her phobia becomes a running joke for the remainder of the series. In [...] "The Gift", Anya sees a stuffed rabbit in the basement of The Magic Box (while looking for the Dagon Sphere with Xander), causing her to scream and exclaim, [...] "Who would put something like that there?!" [...] In [...] "Once More, With Feeling", Anya sings, [...] "Bunnies aren't <b>just</b> cute <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> supposes. They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses, and what's with all the carrots? What do they need such good eyesight for anyway?", a verse reminiscent of Willow's speech about spiders ("Nightmares"). In [...] "Tabula Rasa", while suffering from memory loss, she repeatedly casts a spell that does nothing more than cause rabbits to appear in increasing numbers. The phobia also manifests itself in her final moments. As the final battle approaches, Andrew Wells suggests she [...] "picture happy things: a lake, candy canes, bunnies..." [...] The change is drastic and instantaneous. She confidently raises her sword, saying grimly, [...] "Bunnies. Floppy, hoppy, bunnies." ...|$|R

6000|$|The Duc de Chambertin-Pommard was a {{small but}} lively relic of a really aristocratic family, the members of which were nearly all Atheists up {{to the time of}} the French Revolution, but since that event (beneficial in such various ways) had been very devout. He was a Royalist, a Nationalist, and a {{perfectly}} sincere patriot in that particular style which consists of ceaselessly asserting that one's country is not so much in danger as already destroyed. He wrote cheery little articles for the Royalist Press entitled [...] "The End of France" [...] or [...] "The Last Cry," [...] or what not, and he gave the final touches to a picture of the Kaiser riding across a pavement of prostrate Parisians with a glow of patriotic exultation. He was quite poor, and even his relations had no money. He walked briskly to all his meals at a little open cafe, and he looked <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> else.|$|E
60|$|The {{fortunes}} of the trade unions are interwoven with the industries they serve. The more highly organised trade unions are, the more clearly they recognise their responsibilities; the larger their membership, the greater their knowledge, the wider their outlook. Of course, trade unions will make mistakes, like everybody else, will do foolish things, and wrong things, and want more than {{they are likely to}} get, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> else. But the fact remains that for thirty years trade unions have had a charter from Parliament which up to within a few years ago protected their funds, and gave them effective power to conduct a strike; and no one can say that these thirty years were bad years of British industry, that during these thirty years it was impossible to develop great businesses and carry on large manufacturing operations, because, as everybody knows perfectly well, those were good and expanding years of British trade and national enrichment.|$|E
25|$|Maggie is a {{character}} that appears in Arthur Miller's partially autobiographical play, After the Fall. She is both {{one of his most}} criticised and controversial characters, and one of his most famous ones. She is a thinly veiled version of Marilyn Monroe, Miller's former wife, and thus her suicide attempts after her and Quentin's divorce, and her depression is from reality. This {{is one of the reasons}} that reviews upon its first release were generally negative, owing to the similarities between fact and fiction. However, academic scholars find her to be one of the best, if not the best, of Miller's creations, as the play presents readers with a superb portrait of a woman facing a mental crisis. It also shows Monroe in comparison to the reasons for her marriage to Miller- for example, the fact that Miller took her seriously, and was ready to treat her as more than <b>just</b> an object, <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> else. Miller also highlights his own feelings after Monroe's death by showing Quentin's, and his regret that he had been unable to save her from herself.|$|R

5000|$|... "Maggie's Farm" [...] is {{described}} by Salon.com critic Bill Wyman as [...] "a loping, laconic look at the service industry." [...] Music critic Tim Riley described it as the [...] "counterculture's war cry," [...] but he also notes that the song has been interpreted as [...] "a rock star's gripe to his record company, a songwriter's gripe to his publisher, and a singer-as-commodity's gripe to his audience-as-market." [...] However, AllMusic's William Ruhlmann also notes that [...] "in between the absurdities, the songwriter describes what sound like real problems. 'I got a head full of ideas/That are drivin' me insane,' he sings in the first verse, and given Dylan's prolific writing at the time, that's not hard to believe. In the last verse, he sings, 'I try my best/To be <b>just</b> <b>like</b> I am/But <b>everybody</b> wants you/To be <b>just</b> <b>like</b> them,' another comment that sounds sincere." [...] One of the critical responses to the song, favored by many contemporary fans, is that of film director Todd Haynes. In his Dylan biopic I'm Not There, the song debuts at the Newport Folk Festival, with Dylan and his band firing machine guns at the crowd. At {{the conclusion of the}} performance, Haynes' Dylan declares to a cartoonish folk-protest audience: [...] "I'm sorry for everything I've done, and I hope to remedy it soon." ...|$|R

To a certain extant, I don't mind admitting, seeing that we're being frank with one another, you two gentlemen have got us--that's to say, my employer--in a cleft stick. Frankly, those articles are beginning to attract attention, and if they go on there's {{going to be}} a lot of inconvenience for my employer. That's clear, I reckon. Well, now, here's a square proposition. How much do you want to stop those articles? That's straight. I've been frank with you, and I want you to be frank with me. What's your figure?

[...] "She's {{actually}} delighted when anyone writes her name up in a take-notice for all she pretends to be so mad. But I'm afraid that is an uncharitable speech. Mrs. Allan says we should never make uncharitable speeches; but they do slip out so often before you think, don't they? I simply can't talk about Josie Pye without making an uncharitable speech, so I never mention her at all. You may have noticed that. I'm trying {{to be as much}} like Mrs. Allan as I possibly can, for I think she's perfect. Mr. Allan thinks so too. Mrs. Lynde says he just worships the ground she treads on and she doesn't really think it right for a minister to set his affections so much on a mortal being. But then, Diana, even ministers are human and have their besetting sins <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> else. I had such an interesting talk with Mrs. Allan about besetting sins last Sunday afternoon. There are just a few things it's proper to talk about on Sundays {{and that is one of}} them.

6000|$|Picture us, my dear, afloat in {{the very}} oddest ship you can imagine. It's not the ship, {{so much as the}} people. One does come across queer sorts as one travels. I must say I find it hugely amusing. There's the manager of the line--called Vinrace--a nice big Englishman, doesn't say much--you know the sort. As for the rest--they might have come {{trailing}} out of an old number of Punch. They're like people playing croquet in the 'sixties. How long they've all been shut up in this ship I don't know--years and years I should say--but one feels as though one had boarded a little separate world, and they'd never been on shore, or done ordinary things in their lives. It's what I've always said about literary people--they're far the hardest of any to get on with. The worst of it is, these people--a man and his wife and a niece--might have been, one feels, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> else, if they hadn't got swallowed up by Oxford or Cambridge or some such place, and been made cranks of. The man's really delightful (if he'd cut his nails), and the woman has quite a fine face, only she dresses, of course, in a potato sack, and wears her hair like a Liberty shopgirl's. They talk about art, and think us such poops for dressing in the evening. However, I can't help that; I'd rather die than come in to dinner without changing--wouldn't you? It matters ever so much more than the soup. (It's odd how things like that do matter so much more than what's generally supposed to matter. I'd rather have my head cut off than wear flannel next the skin.) Then there's a nice shy girl--poor thing--I wish one could rake her out before it's too late. She has quite nice eyes and hair, only, of course, she'll get funny too. We ought to start a society for broadening the minds of the young--much more useful than missionaries, Hester! Oh, I'd forgotten there's a dreadful little thing called Pepper. He's just like his name. He's indescribably insignificant, and rather queer in his temper, poor dear. It's like sitting down to dinner with an ill-conditioned fox-terrier, only one can't comb him out, and sprinkle him with powder, as one would one's dog. It's a pity, sometimes, one can't treat people like dogs! The great comfort is that we're away from newspapers, so that Richard will have a real holiday this time. Spain wasn't a holiday. [...] .|$|E
