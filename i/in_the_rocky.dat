5|$|Hygrophorus olivaceoalbus creates mycorrhizae with conifers. In the West Coast of the United States, {{associations}} are most common with Sitka spruces and giant redwoods. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountains it associates with Engelmann spruce and blue spruce, and in northeast North America with hemlocks. It usually favours acidic and chalky ground with mosses in higher altitudes {{as well as}} conifer forests and occasionally mixed forests. The fruit bodies are often found singly, but may also grow in clusters.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, the {{hurricane}} resulted in $3million in damage (1992USD, $4.7million 2011USD). It also left 5,000people homeless, and {{was responsible for}} three fatalities.

5|$|In {{the eastern}} United States, with its {{significant}} rainfall, wildfires {{are relatively small}} and have rarely posed great risk to life and property. As white settlements moved further west into drier areas, the first large scale fires were encountered. Range fires on the Great Plains and forest fires <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountains were far larger and more destructive than what had ever {{been seen in the}} east. A number of catastrophic fire events over the years greatly influenced fire management policies.|$|E
5|$|Leccinum manzanitae is edible, and its {{taste is}} {{sometimes}} rated highly, although others {{have described the}} flavor as bland. Drying the mushroom may improve the flavor. One field guide advises caution when selecting this species for the table, as there have been poisonings reported with similar-looking mushrooms found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountains and Pacific Northwest region of the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Bohemian waxwing has a {{circumpolar}} distribution, breeding {{in northern}} regions of Eurasia and North America. In Eurasia, its northern nesting limit is {{just short of}} the treeline, roughly at the 10°C July isotherm, and it breeds south locally to about 51°N. Most birds breed between 60–67°N, reaching 70°N in Scandinavia. The North American subspecies breeds in the northwestern and north central areas of the continent, its range extending southwards beyond the US border <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountains.|$|E

5|$|The Colorado potato beetle {{was first}} {{observed}} in 1811 by Thomas Nuttall and was formally described in 1824 by the American entomologist Thomas Say. The beetle were collected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountains {{where they were}} feeding on the buffalo bur, Solanum rostratum. The genus Leptinotarsa is assigned to the chrysolmelid beetle tribe Doryphorini (located in subfamily Chrysomelinae), which it shares with four other genera: Calligrapha, Labidomera, Proseicela, and Zygogramma.|$|E
5|$|The Hunger Games {{takes place}} in a nation known as Panem, {{established}} in North America after the destruction of the continent's civilization by an unknown apocalyptic event. The nation consists of the wealthy Capitol and twelve surrounding, poorer districts under the Capitol's dictatorial control. The Capitol exploits the districts for their natural resources and cheap labour. District12 is located in the coal-rich region that was once Appalachia, while the Capitol is located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The female has, on average, a {{narrower}} black back band, slightly duller upperparts and buffer underparts than the male. Her cap may be gray, but many females have black caps and cannot be reliably {{distinguished from the}} male in the field. In the northeastern United States, at least 10% of females have black caps, but the proportion rises to 40–80% <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountains, Mexico and the southeastern U.S. Juveniles {{are similar to the}} adult, but duller plumaged.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} usually {{found in the}} spring, often on duff under {{conifers}} shortly after the snow melts. In North America, {{where it has been}} noted to occur only between March and July, it is widespread <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountains and the Pacific Northwest. C.fulgens has been collected in Britain, and possibly arrived there from imported infected seeds. It has also been collected from Japan, Sweden, The Netherlands, and Turkey. It is listed on the Red List of protected species in Slovakia.|$|E
5|$|In the Atlantic, Irene {{produced}} moderate {{rainfall and}} winds along its path, although impact was greatest in Nicaragua where it moved ashore as a hurricane. A total of 96homes were destroyed, and 1,200people were left homeless. The rainfall resulted in widespread flooding, killing {{three people in}} Rivas. In neighboring Costa Rica, Hurricane Irene caused more than $1million (USD) in damage to the banana crop. Later, the remnants of Hurricane Olivia produced rainfall in the southwest United States. Flooding was reported near Yuma, Arizona, which closed a major highway, and the moisture produced snowfall in higher elevations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Late in its duration, Hurricane Olivia brought {{increased}} moisture {{into the}} southwest United States. More than 2inches (50mm) of rainfall were reported across Arizona and New Mexico. Light precipitation was also reported in western Texas and southeastern California. The National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings throughout the region. Near Yuma, Arizona, thunderstorms caused three major power outages and produced flooding {{that resulted in}} the closure of a portion of U.S. Route 95. In Navajo and Pinal counties, the rainfall damaged roads, bridges, sewers, and homes, which amounted to about $250,000 in repair work for the state of Arizona. The storm's moisture also produced locally heavy snowfall in higher elevations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountains.|$|E

5|$|Marcy Cottrell Houle wrote Wings for My Flight in {{the several}} decades {{following}} a major {{decline in the}} peregrine falcon population, which occurred between 1950 and 1970. During the 1930s and 1940s, an estimated 1000 breeding pairs of peregrine falcons inhabited the western United States and Mexico, coupled with 500 pairs in the eastern U.S. By the 1970s, no peregrine falcons were discovered east of the Rocky Mountains, and in the west, peregrine falcon populations had declined by 80 to 90 percent. By 1975, {{the year in which}} the events of Wings for My Flight take place, only 324 pairs of peregrine falcons were known to reside in North America, with only seven pairs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rocky</b> Mountains region, and one at Chimney Rock, a prominent rock formation in southwestern Colorado.|$|E
5|$|McConnell {{graduated}} from the University of Colorado as a Doctor of Medicine in 1925 and completed an internship at Denver General Hospital.

She was appointed Denver's city toxicologist in 1926 and became an assistant pathologist in 1927, working alongside deputy coroner George Bostwick and city pathologist W. S. Dennis.

Io's location within one of Jupiter's most intense radiation belts precluded a prolonged close flyby, but Galileo did pass close by shortly before entering orbit for its two-year, primary mission studying the Jovian system. Although no images were taken during the close flyby on 7 December 1995, the encounter did yield significant results, such as the discovery of a large iron core, similar to that found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocky</b> planets of the inner Solar System.|$|E
