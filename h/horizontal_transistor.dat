40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{application}} of macroporous silicon (MpSi) to the fabrication of transistors: Four different FET transistor structures are proposed using MpSi as the base material. These devices have been studied by simulation, and their characteristics are shown herein. The proposed structures include JFET, MOSFET, and trio de-like devices; in this study, we have considered both vertical and horizontal structures. For the vertical case, the proposed devices use the MpSi tubes to create the channel, filling them with a semiconductor and using the bulk silicon as a cylindrical gate all around. In contrast, for the <b>horizontal</b> <b>transistors,</b> the MpSi structure is used as the channel medium, while the conductor-filled pores serve as the controlling gate, thus obtaining a trio de-like device. The use of MpSi allows one to obtain large transistor arrays of extremely high density, thus obtaining {{a large amount of}} parallel devices in a moderate-to-small device area. Even more, pore engineering introduces a degree of freedom {{in the design of the}} transistor characteristics. We show that the proposed devices have a low threshold voltage and can support large currents. Finally, the behavior of these structures is studied for different geometries.

40|$|We {{report a}} method for making <b>horizontal</b> wrap-gate {{nanowire}} <b>transistors</b> with up to four independently controllable wrap-gated segments. While the step up to two independent wrap-gates requires {{a major change in}} fabrication methodology, a key advantage to this new approach, and the horizontal orientation more generally, is that achieving more than two wrap-gate segments then requires no extra fabrication steps. This is in contrast to the vertical orientation, where a significant subset of the fabrication steps needs to be repeated for each additional gate. We show that cross-talk between adjacent wrap-gate segments is negligible despite separations less than 200 nm. We also demonstrate the ability to make multiple wrap-gate transistors on a single nanowire using the exact same process. The excellent scalability potential of <b>horizontal</b> wrap-gate nanowire <b>transistors</b> makes them highly favorable for the development of advanced nanowire devices and possible integration with vertical wrap-gate nanowire transistors in 3 D nanowire network architectures...|$|R

Among nanomaterials developed to date, nanowires in particular have high aspect ratios, surface areas, and very small diameters on a sub- 100 -nm scale. Thus, they are ideal building blocks for probing single cell activity on a submicron scale. Notably, few studies have probed electrical activity (i.e., action potential) in an extracellular mode by using <b>horizontal</b> nanowire <b>transistors</b> [7, 21]. Probing the neural activity in an intracellular mode is also promising because the nanowire size is sufficiently small to provide an intracellular interface with neural cells without cell damage [22, 23].

The active transistor region is {{built in the}} defect-free sidewall of 900 -nm-wide n-hills on a (110) wafer.

The active transistor region is processed in the sidewalls of the n-hill, which makes this structure attractive for the integration with pillar-like CMOS with minimum process additions. HCBT technology is simple with 5 lithography masks. The active n-hills are isolated by newly developed chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) and etch back of oxide.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} two substantial {{problems of}} organic electronic devices: the controllability and adjustability of performance, and the integration using scalable, high resolution patterning techniques for planar thin-film transistors and novel vertical transistor devices. Both problems {{are of particular}} importance {{for the success of}} transparent and flexible organic electronics in the future. To begin with, the static behavior in molecular doped organic pin-diodes is investigated. This allows to deduce important diode parameters such as the depletion capacitance, the number of active dopant states, and the breakdown field. Applying this knowledge, organic pin-diodes are designed for ultra-high-frequency applications and a cut-off-frequency of up to 1 GHz can be achieved using optimized parameters for device geometry, layer thickness, and dopant concentration. The second part of this work is devoted to organic thin-film transistors, high resolution patterning techniques, as well as novel vertical transistor concepts. In particular, fluorine based photo-lithography, a high resolution patterning technique compatible to organic semiconductors, is introduced fielding the integration of organic thin-film transistors under ambient conditions. However, as it will be shown, <b>horizontal</b> organic thin-film <b>transistors</b> are substantially limited in their performance by charge carrier injection. Hence, down-scaling is inappropriate to enlarge the transconductance of such transistors. To overcome this drawback, a novel vertical thin-film transistor concept with a vertical channel length of ∼ 50 nm is realized using fluorine based photo-lithography. These vertical devices can surpass the performance of planar transistors and hence are prospective candidates for future integration in complex electronic circuits...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to perform a comprehensive simulation study of the statistical variability in well scaled fully depleted ultra thin body silicon on insulator (FD-UTB SOI) at nanometer regime. It describes the design procedure for template FDUTB SOI transistor scaling and the impacts of statistical variability and reliability the scaled template transistor. The starting point {{of this study is}} a systematic simulation analysis based on a welldesigned 32 nm thin body SOI template transistor provided by the FP 7 project PULLNANO. The 32 nm template transistor is consistent with the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductor (ITRS) 2009 specifications. The wellestablished 3 D ‘atomistic’ simulator GARAND has been employed in the designing of the scaled transistors and to carry out the statistical variability simulations. Following the foundation work in characterizing and optimizing the template 32 nm gate length transistor, the scaling proceeds down to 22 nm, 16 nm and 11 nm gate lengths using typically 0. 7 scaling factor in respect of the <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>transistor</b> dimensions. The device design process is targeted for low power applications with a careful consideration of the impacts of the design parameters choice including buried oxide thickness (TBOX), source/drain doping abruptness (σ) and spacer length (Lspa). In order to determine the values of TBOX, σ, and Lspa, it is important to analyze simulation results, carefully assessing the impact on manufacturability and to consider the corresponding trade-off between short channel effects and on-current performance. Considering the above factors, TBOX = 10 nm, σ = 2 nm/dec and Lspa = 7 nm have been adopted as optimum values respectively. iv The statistical variability of the transistor characteristics due to intrinsic parameter fluctuation (IPF) in well-scaled FD-UTB SOI devices is systematically studied for the first time. The impact of random dopant fluctuation (RDF), line edge roughness (LER) and metal gate granularity (MGG) on threshold voltage (Vth), on-current (Ion) and drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL) are analysed. Each principal sources of variability is treated individually and in combination with other variability sources in the simulation of large ensembles of microscopically different devices. The introduction of highk/ metal gate stack has improved the electrostatic integrity and enhanced the overall device performance. However, in the case of fully depleted channel transistors, MGG has become a dominant variability factor for all critical electrical parameters at gate first technology. For instance, σVth due to MGG increased to 41. 9 mV at 11 nm gate length compared to 26. 0 mV at 22 nm gate length. Similar trend has also been observed in σIon, increasing from 0. 065 up to 0. 174 mA/μm when the gate length is reduced from 22 nm down to 11 nm. Both RDF and LER have significant role in the intrinsic parameter fluctuations and therefore, none of these sources should be overlooked in the simulations. Finally, the impact of different variability sources in combination with positive bias temperature instability (PBTI) degradation on Vth, Ion and DIBL of the scaled nMOSFETs is investigated. Our study indicates that BTI induced charge trapping is a crucial reliability problem for the FD-UTB SOI transistors operation. Its impact not only introduces a significant degradation of transistor performance, but also accelerates the statistical variability. For example, the effect of a late degradation stage (at trap density of 1 e 12 /cm 2) in the presence of RDF, LER and MGG results in σVth increase to 36. 9 mV, 45. 0 mV and 58. 3 mV for 22 nm, 16 nm and 11 nm respectively from the original 29. 0 mV, 37. 9 mV and 50. 4 mV values in the fresh transistors...|$|R
