5|$|Copper is an {{essential}} trace element in plants and animals, but not all microorganisms. The human body contains copper {{at a level of}} about 1.4 to 2.1mg per kg of body mass. Copper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound to albumin.

Ceruloplasmin also carries the copper that is excreted in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source. Copper in the body normally undergoes <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>circulation</b> (about 5mg a day, vs. about 1mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The case-fatality for {{intentional}} self-poisoning in {{the rural}} developing world is 10 - 50 -fold higher than that in industrialised countries, mostly because {{of the use of}} highly toxic pesticides and plants. We therefore aimed to assess whether routine treatment with multiple-dose activated charcoal, to interrupt enterovascular or <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>circulations,</b> offers benefit compared with no charcoal in such an environment. METHODS: We did an open-label, parallel group, randomised, controlled trial of six 50 g doses of activated charcoal at 4 -h intervals versus no charcoal versus one 50 g dose of activated charcoal in three Sri Lankan hospitals. 4632 patients were randomised to receive no charcoal (n= 1554), one dose of charcoal (n= 1545), or six doses of charcoal (n= 1533); outcomes were available for 4629 patients. 2338 (51 %) individuals had ingested pesticides, whereas 1647 (36 %) had ingested yellow oleander (Thevetia peruviana) seeds.

25|$|Inactivation of {{estradiol}} includes {{conversion to}} less-active estrogens, such as estrone and estriol. Estriol {{is the major}} urinary metabolite. Estradiol is conjugated in the liver to form estrogen conjugates like estradiol sulfate, estradiol glucuronide and, as such, excreted via the kidneys. Some of the water-soluble conjugates are excreted via the bile duct, and partly reabsorbed after hydrolysis from the intestinal tract. This <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>circulation</b> contributes to maintaining estradiol levels.|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol is {{oxidized}} by {{the liver}} into {{a variety of}} bile acids. These, in turn, are conjugated with glycine, taurine, glucuronic acid, or sulfate. A mixture of conjugated and nonconjugated bile acids, along with cholesterol itself, is excreted from the liver into the bile. Approximately 95% of the bile acids are reabsorbed from the intestines, and the remainder are lost in the feces. The excretion and reabsorption of bile acids forms the basis of the <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>circulation,</b> which is essential for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats. Under certain circumstances, when more concentrated, as in the gallbladder, cholesterol crystallises and is the major constituent of most gallstones (lecithin and bilirubin gallstones also occur, but less frequently). Every day, up to 1 g of cholesterol enters the colon. This cholesterol originates from the diet, bile, and desquamated intestinal cells, and can be metabolized by the colonic bacteria. Cholesterol is converted mainly into coprostanol, a nonabsorbable sterol that is excreted in the feces. A cholesterol-reducing bacterium origin has been isolated from human feces.|$|E
25|$|Unconjugated {{hyperbilirubinaemia}} in {{a newborn}} {{can lead to}} accumulation of bilirubin in certain brain regions (particularly the basal nuclei) with consequent irreversible damage to these areas manifesting as various neurological deficits, seizures, abnormal reflexes and eye movements. This type of neurological injury is known as kernicterus. The spectrum of clinical effect is called bilirubin encephalopathy. The neurotoxicity of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia manifests because the blood–brain barrier has yet to develop fully, and bilirubin can freely pass into the brain interstitium, whereas more developed individuals with increased bilirubin in the blood are protected. Aside from specific chronic medical conditions {{that may lead to}} hyperbilirubinaemia, neonates in general are at increased risk since they lack the intestinal bacteria that facilitate the breakdown and excretion of conjugated bilirubin in the faeces (this is largely why the faeces of a neonate are paler than those of an adult). Instead the conjugated bilirubin is converted back into the unconjugated form by the enzyme β-glucuronidase (in the gut, this enzyme is located in the brush border of the lining intestinal cells) and a large proportion is reabsorbed through the <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>circulation.</b>|$|E
40|$|Fasting is {{associated}} with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in several species, including the horse. Studies in ponies showed that a 3 -day fast decreased plasma clearance of bilirubin, cholic acid, and sulfobromophthalein (BSP). Since these organic anions are conjugated with different substrates, {{it is possible that}} observed differences in plasma clearance result from a general decrease in hepatic conjugating capacity during the animals&# 39; fasting. To test this hypothesis, the effects of a 3 -day fast on plasma clearance of IV injected BSP (4. 4 to 5. 1 mg/kg), which is conjugated to glutathione, and indocyanine green (ICG; 0. 8 to 1. 1 mg/kg), which is not conjugated, were studied in 10 healthy horses and 2 ponies with diverted <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>circulations</b> (indwelling T tubes). Blood samples were obtained for 30 minutes after injection, and bile samples from ponies were obtained for 3 hours. Fasting increased plasma bilirubin concentration in all animals studied (from 1. 03 +/- 0. 337 mg/dl in control animals to 3. 49 +/- 1. 01 mg/dl in fasted animals). Kinetic values of ICG disappearance were determined from single exponential functions, and those for BSP were determined from both single and curvilinear (2 -exponential) functions. Plasma clearance of BSP in fed horses (8. 65 +/- 1. 02 ml X min- 1 X kg- 1) was greater than clearance of ICG (3. 54 +/- 0. 67 ml X min- 1 X kg- 1), results similar to those reported in dogs, cats, rats, and persons. Fasting significantly decreased fractional plasma disappearance rate of both BSP (- 36 %) and ICG (- 58 %) and similarly reduced plasma clearance (BSP,- 48 %; ICG,- 55 %).

40|$|Abstract: Animal {{and human}} {{clinical}} {{studies have demonstrated}} the ability of dietary food proteins to modulate endogenous lipid levels during abnormal lipid metabolism (dyslipidemia). Considering the susceptibility of proteins to gastric proteolytic activities, the hypolipidemic functions of proteins are possibly due, in part, to their peptide fragments. Food-derived peptides may directly modulate abnormal lipid metabolism in cell cultures and animal models of dyslipidemia. The peptides are thought to act by perturbing intestinal absorption of dietary cholesterol and <b>enterohepatic</b> bile acid <b>circulation,</b> and by inhibiting lipogenic enzymatic activities and gene expression in hepatocytes and adipocytes. Recent evidence indicates that the hypolipidemic activities of some peptides are due to activation of hepatic lipogenic transcription factors. However, detailed molecular mechanisms and structural requirements of peptides for these activities are yet to be elucidated. As hypolipidemic peptides can be released during enzymatic food processing, future studies can explore the prospects of combating metabolic syndrome and associated complications using peptide-rich functional food and nutraceutical products...|$|R

High-dose continuous intravenous penicillin G has been reported to be of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with cephalosporins show promise. There is some evidence that intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of death cap poisoning. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by hepatocytes, thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis.

40|$|Bile {{formation}} {{is a vital}} function of the liver, which is impaired in cholestasis. The secretion of bile depends on the structural and functional integrity of transport systems in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. The polarized hepatocyte has highly specialized transporters located on the basolateral- (sinusoidal-) and the canalicular-(apical-) domain. Vectorial hepatocellular secretion of bile acids from blood into bile is a major mechanism for both hepatic bile formation and ongoing <b>enterohepatic</b> bile acid <b>circulation.</b> Two highly specialized proteins regulate bile acid uptake and secretion in the hepatocyte: Ntcp on the basolateral membrane is responsible for import and BSEP on the apical domain is the principal exporter for bile acids into bile. Impairment of bile acid transport can occur upon infections or exposure to drugs, as wellas in autoimmune, metabolic or genetic disorders. The research described in this thesis aims at defining components reponsible for cholestasis of sepsis and to investigate mechanisms of adaptation employed by the liver cell in response to accumulation of biliary constituents as occurs in cholestasis. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is glucuronidated by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) to its {{pharmacologically}} inactive 7 -O-glucuronide metabolite (MPAG). MPAG is excreted {{into the}} bile via the multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP 2 /ABCC 2), which {{is essential for}} <b>enterohepatic</b> (re) <b>circulation</b> (EHC) of MPA(G). METHODS: The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MRP 2 (G- 1549 A, G- 1023 A, A- 1019 G, C- 24, G 1249 A, C 3972 T and G 4544 A) and UGT 1 A 9 (C- 2152 T, T- 275 AandT 98 C) genes and MPA pharmacokinetics in 95 renal allograft recipients at days 7, 42, 90, and 360 after transplantation. In addition to mycophenolate mofetil, all patients received tacrolimus and corticosteroids as immunosuppression. RESULTS: At day seven after transplantation, in the absence of the MRP 2 C- 24 T SNP, mild liver dysfunction was associated with significantly lower MPA dose-interval exposure and higher MPA oral clearance, while liver dysfunction did not affect MPA pharmacokinetics in patients with the MRP 2 C- 24 T variant. A similar effect is noted for the C- 3972 T variant, which is in linkage disequilibrium with C- 24 T. At later time points after transplantation the MRP 2 C- 24 T SNP was associated with significantly higher dose-corrected MPA trough levels. Patients with the MRP 2 C- 24 T variant had significantly more diarrhea in the first year after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: The MRP 2 C- 24 T and C- 3972 T polymorphisms protect renal transplant recipients from a decrease in MPA exposure associated with mild liver dysfunction. Furthermore, this study suggests that the C- 24 T SNP is associated with a lower oral clearance of MPA in steady-state conditions. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We posed six {{clinical}} questions (CQ) on preoperative biliary drainage {{and organized}} all pertinent evidence regarding these questions. CQ 1. Is preoperative biliary drainage necessary {{for patients with}} jaundice? The indications for preoperative drainage for jaundiced patients are changing greatly. Many reports state that, excluding conditions such as cholangitis and liver dysfunction, biliary drainage is not necessary before pancreatoduodenectomy or less invasive surgery. However, the morbidity and mortality of extended hepatectomy for biliary cancer is still high, and {{the most common cause}} of death is hepatic failure; therefore, preoperative biliary drainage is desirable in patients who are to undergo extended hepatectomy. CQ 2. What procedures are appropriate for preoperative biliary drainage? There are three methods of biliary drainage: percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD), endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) or endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD), and surgical drainage. ERBD is an internal drainage method, and PTBD and ENBD are external methods. However, there are no reports of comparisons of preoperative biliary drainage methods using randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Thus, at this point, a method should be used that can be safely performed with the equipment and techniques available at each facility. CQ 3. Which is better, unilateral or bilateral biliary drainage, in malignant hilar obstruction? Unilateral biliary drainage of the future remnant hepatic lobe is usually enough even when intrahepatic bile ducts are separated into multiple units due to hilar malignancy. Bilateral biliary drainage should be considered in the following cases: those in which the operative procedure is difficult to determine before biliary drainage; those in which cholangitis has developed after unilateral drainage; and those in which the decrease in serum bilirubin after unilateral drainage is very slow. CQ 4. What is the best treatment for postdrainage fever? The most likely cause of high fever in patients with biliary drainage is cholangitis due to problems with the existing drainage catheter or segmental cholangitis if an undrained segment is left. In the latter case, urgent drainage is required. CQ 5. Is bile culture necessary in patients with biliary drainage who are to undergo surgery? Monitoring of bile cultures is necessary for patients with biliary drainage to determine the appropriate use of antibiotics during the perioperative period. CQ 6. Is bile replacement useful for patients with external biliary drainage? Maintenance of the <b>enterohepatic</b> bile <b>circulation</b> is vitally important. Thus, preoperative bile replacement in patients with external biliary drainage is very likely to be effective when highly invasive surgery (e. g., extended hepatectomy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma) is planned...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The case {{fatality}} for intentional self-poisoning {{in rural}} Asia is 10 – 30 {{times higher than}} in the West, mostly due to the use of highly toxic poisons. Activated charcoal is a widely available intervention that may – if given early – bind to poisons in the stomach and prevent their absorption. Current guidelines recommend giving a single dose of charcoal (SDAC) if patients arrive within an hour of ingestion. Multiple doses (MDAC) may increase poison elimination at a later time by interrupting any <b>enterohepatic</b> or enterovascular <b>circulations.</b> The effectiveness of SDAC or MDAC is unknown. Since most patients present to hospital after one hour, we considered MDAC to have a higher likelihood of clinical benefit and set up a study to compare MDAC with no charcoal. A third arm of SDAC was added to help determine whether any benefit noted from MDAC resulted from the first dose or all doses. Methods/design We set up a randomised controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of superactivated charcoal in unselected adult self-poisoning patients admitted to the adult medical wards of three Sri Lankan secondary hospitals. Patients were randomised to standard treatment or standard treatment plus either a single 50 g dose of superactivated charcoal dissolved in 300 ml of water or six doses every four hours. All patients with a history of poison ingestion were approached concerning the study and written informed consent taken from each patient, or their relative (for unconscious patients or those 72 hrs post-ingestion, and previous recruitment. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality; secondary outcomes included the occurrence of serious complications (need for intubation, time requiring assisted ventilation, fits, cardiac dysrhythmias). Analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis; the effects of reported time to treatment after poisoning and status on admission will also be assessed. Discussion This trial will provide important information on the effectiveness of both single and multiple dose activated charcoal in the forms of poisoning commonly seen in rural Asia. If charcoal is found to be effective, {{it should be possible to}} make it widely available across rural Asia in an affordable formulation.
