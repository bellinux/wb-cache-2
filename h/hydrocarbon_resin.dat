It has the chemical stabilizing property to acid and alkaline, viscosity adjusting and thermal stabilizing, Generally, the petroleum resins are not used independently, but have to be used together with other kinds of resins as promoters, adjusting agents and modifiers in hot-melt adhesive, pressure-sensitive adhesive, hot melt road marking paint, rubber tires and so on.|$|E
40|$|Several {{thermoanalytical}} {{methods were}} used to assess the compatibility of EBA (copolymer of ethylene and n-butyl acrylate) hot melts containing tackifiers of different nature (pentaerythritol rosin ester, polyterpene resin, aliphatic <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>resin,</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>resin,</b> and cycloaliphatic-aromatic <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>resin).</b> The influence of the compatibility of EBA hot melts on their rheological, viscoelastic, and adhesion properties to polar (aluminum foil) and nonpolar (polypropylene film) substrates were analyzed. The viscosity and shear thinning at 160 °C of EBA hot melts varied significantly by changing the tackifier nature; however, at 180 °C all EBA hot melts showed similar viscosities and shear thinning was absent because of the rupture of physical interactions between their components. EBA copolymer showed broad tackifier compatibility, even though aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon resins were less compatible. Compatibility was assessed by softening point and cloud point measurement, and dynamical mechanical thermal analysis. The most compatible EBA hot melts were obtained with rosin ester, polyterpene and cycloaliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon tackifiers and they showed the highest tack and adhesion. On the contrary, the less-compatible EBA hot melts were obtained with aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon tackifiers, and they showed the lowest adhesion. EBA containing aliphatic hydrocarbon tackifier was exceptional because of even being incompatible, it showed high tack. Financial support by REPSOL (Móstoles, Madrid, Spain) is acknowledged...|$|E

40|$|This study {{concerns}} the silica reinforcement of styrene–butadiene rubber compounds for passenger car tire treads, {{with the objective}} of gaining greater insight into the beneficial effects of oligomeric resins. The major tire performance factors predicted are rolling resistance and (wet) skid resistance measured on a laboratory scale. Three types of resins were tested: a polyterpene, a terpene-phenolic, and a pure vinyl-aromatic <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>resin,</b> at various concentrations, namely, 2, 4, and 6 parts per hundred of rubber (phr). Laboratory scale dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), Mooney viscosity, cure meter, and tensile and hardness tests were used to assess the behavior of these resins in the rubber and to characterize the processibility of the compounds. The DMA shows that the resins and rubber compounds are partially compatible for the low resin quantities used. The tan δ loss factor versus temperature was used as an indication for wet skid and rolling resistance. The shift to a higher temperature in the tan δ peak, due to the contribution of the tan δ peak shift of the resins, is the reason for improved wet skid performance. A maximum improvement of about 35 % in the wet skid region (0 °C– 30 °C) is found. The improved tan δ at 60 °C, indicative for rolling resistance, accounts for reduced interaction between filler particles. This is also confirmed by a decrease in the Payne effect. A maximum improvement of about 15 % is found in the rolling resistance temperature range, dependent on the particular choice of the resin...|$|E
40|$|Neste trabalho, o {{principal}} objetivo foi avaliar a influência de uma resina hidrocarbônica hidrogenada (RHH), de baixo peso molecular e alta temperatura de transição vítrea (Tg) na estrutura e propriedades finais de blendas de polipropileno (PP) com diferentes teores de comonômero etileno. As blendas foram preparadas a partir de um concentrado de PP/RHH e utilizando extrusora dupla-rosca. Os filmes foram obtidos em extrusora de matriz tubular descendente. Um estudo preliminar, em reômetro rotacional, foi realizado para determinar as temperaturas em que todas as blendas têm a mesma viscosidade, para que os filmes sejam obtidos em condições equivalentes de processamento para comparação das propriedades finais. Os resultados mostraram que a adição da RHH ao PP diminui a viscosidade em função do baixo peso molecular dessas resinas e da miscibilidade com o PP no estado fundido. Pela análise mecânico-dinâmica foi comprovada a miscibilidade da RHH com o PP. O estudo realizado pelo DSC mostrou à influência da RHH no comportamento térmico do PP. A cristalinidade do PP nas blendas aumenta com o aumento do teor de RHH. A temperatura de fusão e de cristalização para as blendas com homopolímero de polipropileno (i-PP) diminuíram, enquanto que, para as blendas de polipropileno randômico (PP-R) com maior teor de etileno, foi o comportamento oposto. Também foram avaliadas a espessura de lamela, a largura de pico de fusão e o t 1 / 2 de cristalização não-isotérmica. Pela microscopia ótica foi observada a diminuição da velocidade de cristalização e do diâmetro do esferulito com a adição da RHH ao i-PP. As propriedades dos filmes de PP foram afetadas pela RHH. Os filmes das blendas apresentaram incremento no módulo secante sem modificações nas propriedades óticas. As propriedades de barreira melhoraram significativamente, obtendo a redução de até 49 % na permeabilidade ao oxigênio e 31 % na permeabilidade ao vapor d’água com a adição de 20 % de RHH. In this work, {{the main}} {{objective was to}} evaluate {{the influence of a}} hydrogenated <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>resin</b> (RHH), low molecular weight and high glass transition temperature (Tg), in the structure and final properties of blends of polypropylene (PP) with different amounts of ethylene comonomer. The blends were prepared from a masterbatch of PP / RHH by using twin-screw extruder. The films were obtained in descending tubular extruder die. A preliminary study, in rotational rheometer, was conducted to determine the temperatures at which all blends have the same viscosity, in order to obtain films in equivalent processing conditions for proper comparison of final properties. The results showed that addition of RHH to PP decrease the viscosity because of the low molecular weight of these resins and the miscibility with the PP in the melt. Dynamic mechanical analysis was confirmed the miscibility between PP and RHH. The study by DSC showed the influence of RHH on the thermal properties of PP. It was observed that increasing the RHH content, the crystallinity of the PP in the blend also increases. It was observed a decreasing in melting and crystallization temperatures for the blends with polypropylene homopolymer (i-PP), while blends of random polypropylene (PP-R) with higher ethylene content, presented the opposite behavior. Also the lamella thickness, width of melting peak and t 1 / 2 non-isothermal crystallization were evaluated. In i-PP homopolymer blends with RHH, by using optical microscopy, it was observed that the rate of crystallization and spherulite diameter decreased with the increasing of the amount of RHH. The film properties of PP were affected by the presence of RHH. It was an increase in the secant modulus of the films without any change in optical properties. It was found significant improvement in barrier properties. With the addition of 20 % RHH, reduction in oxygen permeability was achieved until 49 % and water vapor permeability, 31 %...|$|E

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{an evaluation of}} potential alternatives for BF 3 removal from synthetic <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>resins</b> at Neville Chemicals Europe (NCE). NCE produces 30 kt. <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>resins</b> each year. In 6 kt. of these resins BF 3 {{is used as a}} catalyst. BF 3 is a lewis acid that is toxic and causes corrosion to the process equipment. For these two reasons it is necessary to remove the BF 3 from the resin mixture. Currently the BF 3 is neutralized with NaOH and then separatedfrom the liquid mixture by using the difference in density in a sinktank. The removal efficiency of this process is unknown, however it is known that not all of the BF 3 is removed this way. This report is a survey of alternative technologies for this process. Several technologies are described and discussed on how the technology works, the removal rate of BF 3 from the resin mixture and implementation possibilities for this case. The removal technologies that are reviewed are: contact with an anhydrous solid inorganic oxide (alumina mesh), moving through a bed of silica, removal by calcination, contact with diaryl ketone or an amine (benzophenone), heating the liquid to reflux, contacting the resin mixture with superheated inert solvent and contact with acrylic fibers. Finally the alternative technologies are compared to each other and the existing technology and an advice is formulated for further development. Four conditions are stated on which the alternatives are valued; (1) the removal rate is known, (2) a removal efficiency as high as possible to retain the quality of the resin and minimize corrosion, preferably 100 %, (3) the resin should not be damaged or polluted in the removal process, (4) the removal process should be industrial applicable. After the analyses it becomes clear that there are just two technologies that render a removal rate of 100 %, these are removal by silica and removal by acrylic fibers. The removal by silica {{is the only one that}} is industrial applicable so the advise is to further develop this technology for implementation at NCE for removal the removal of BF 3 from synthetic <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>resins.</b> ...|$|R
30|$|It is {{well known}} that crude oil is a complex mixture {{containing}} paraffins, aromatic <b>hydrocarbons,</b> <b>resins,</b> and asphaltenes. Among them, paraffins are considered as a major challenge, especially for the upstream petroleum industry. The solubility of high-molecular paraffins is strongly related to the temperature. With the decreasing temperature, these paraffins tend to precipitate and form stable wax crystals. The wax crystals will deposit on the pipe wall and/or transport with fluids, which would reduce the flowability of crude oils and plug pipelines or seize equipments, leading to costly downtime and expensive remediation techniques (Bacon et al. 2010; Bello et al. 2006).|$|R
40|$|Polypropylene (PP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} polymers in use. It is a cheap commodity plastic, yet useful for manufacturing a range of versatile products. One of the prominent applications of PP is the production of biaxially oriented PP film (BOPP), which became an irreplaceable material for food and tobacco packaging and a substrate for printing the Australian banknotes. The ultimate properties of polymer products are the result of a combination of factors, such as molecular structure of the resin and processing conditions. Understanding the influence of these factors on the final polymer properties would allow cost-effective development of more efficient technologies for manufacturing high quality products. Rheology was found to be the most useful tool for assessing the interrelations between several aspects of molecular structure (more precisely, molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, MW and MWD) and the processability of polypropylene. As a science of flow and deformation, rheology studies the various aspects of deformation that occur during the BOPP processing. Shear flow dominates during the extrusion of the PP melt, while the extensional deformation dominates when it&# 039;s being blown into a bubble and stretched. In the work presented here, several PP grades, including homo-polymers, co-polymers and blends, were characterised in terms of MW, MWD, shear and extensional rheology. Additionally, differential scanning calorimetry was used to determine the thermal properties of the grades and to provide information on the morphology of the materials at different temperatures. Gel-permeation chromatography was a method of choice to study the polymers&# 039; MWD; moreover, by coupling the viscometer to the refractive index detector, it was possible to study the long-chain branching (LCB). None of the PP grades showed presence of LCB. The shear rheological characterisation was performed in both steady and dynamic mode. The steady shear measurements provided the most relevant data for prediction of the polymer melt behaviour under processing conditions. However, dynamic or oscillatory shear measurements produced a large set of data useful for estimation of the linear visco-elastic properties that can be related to their MWDs. Extensional rheology of PP was also carefully studied by measuring the transient extensional viscosity, also known as the stress growth coefficient, &eta; + E (t). All measurements were conducted in such a way that would provide the most possible precision and accuracy. The error analysis was performed for all the rheological measurements. All tests were repeated several times in order to verify the repeatability. Wherever possible, the reproducibility of measurements was determined as well, by comparing the data obtained from different instruments. This was especially important in case of GPC analysis, which is a calibration-based technique and also for extensional rheometry, which is not a well-established method yet. Furthermore, it was attempted to estimate the MWD of several PP homo-polymer grades from their steady shear viscosity curves, by inversion of blending laws. The resulting curves were much narrower than the GPC curves and did not retain the information on the broadness of distribution. The dynamic shear data were also utilised to estimate the MWD. First, the relaxation time spectra for polymer grades were calculated from their dynamic moduli, G&# 039; and G&quot;. A recently developed analytical relationship between relaxation spectrum and MWD was then applied to the commercial PP grades for the first time. The obtained distribution curves were narrower than the GPC ones, but they preserved their relative position and breadth, i. e. they could be used for comparison between grades. This provides a basis for the future work in utilisation of rheological measurement for MWD determinations. Many correlations between rheological parameters and MW averages and polydispersities have been formerly known. Most common of them were tested and discussed for their reliability and practicality for polymer grades used in BOPP processing. The use of such correlations, e. g. between Mw and zero shear viscosity or between the degree of shear thinning and polydispersity, can provide an assistance for engineers involved in polymer processing. Blending PP with an amorphous <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>resin</b> - hydrogenated oligo-cydopentadiene (HOCP), has been recently shown to improve final BOPP properties, such as gas permeability. The use of a commercial modifier, EPI that consists of 50 wt% PP and 50 wt% HOCP, for blending with different PP grades, was studied here for the first time. Rheological and morphological characterisation of the blends was performed and the correlation between miscibility and the rheological behaviour was drawn. It was found that two factors were highly significant: -the concentration of the oligomeric resin, HOCP, which lowered the viscosity and dictated the onset of phase separation and -the MWD compatibility of the PP grade with the polypropylene pre-blended in EPI. Extensional rheological measurements were conducted with PP grades in different morphological states, controlled by temperature. Strain hardening was found for PP stretched from the semi-molten state, which exists at temperatures slightly lower than its melting point, Tm. The extensional viscosity index, EVI was introduced in this study as a measure of strain hardening for polypropylene and a practical tool for relating the results of extensional rheological measurements to processability of PP grades at different conditions. The results were supported by shear rheological, GPC, DSC and optical microscopy testings, where any of the listed methods by itself was not sufficient to predict the behaviour of semi-molten PP under extensional deformation. It was shown that the factors that dominate the processability of polymers in industrial processing and their interrelationships are very complex. By identifying the key parameters of interest for a specific process (e. g. extensional viscosity, strain, strain rates, temperature, shear viscosity etc. in case of film blowing) it may become possible to develop models that predict the processing behaviour of the polymer grades. This work provides a basis for developing such models...|$|E

40|$|The Austin Chalk is an impure "onshore" chalk {{that was}} {{deposited}} on a ramp marginal to the Gulf of Mexico during the Late Cretaceous. Basinal chalks are organic rich, commonly containing 0. 5 - 5. 0 % amorphous, sapropelic kerogen derived from marine organic matter with only trace amounts of terrestial kerogen. Less organic matter was deposited and perserved in oxygenated shallow water, and fresh-water diagenesis oxidized the organic matter on outcrop. In each sample, the kerogen {{is concentrated in}} microstylolites, with organic fluids segregated in micropores in the chalk. The bitumen from the Austin Chalk contains geochemical fossils characteristic of plankton and algae: steranes, triterpanes, isoprenoids (particularly pristane and phytane), and even-carbon numbered C(, 15) -C(, 22) n-alkanes. These geochemical fossils become less abundant with increasing burial depth, due to the generation of hydrocarbons during catagenesis. The kerogen darkens and becomes condensed and aromatic as the H/C atomic ratio decreases and hydrocarbons are liberated from the kerogen and from asphaltenes. Saturated hydrocarbons, particularly C(, 12) -C(, 26) n-alkanes and isoalkanes and single-ring cycloalkanes, increase more rapidly than aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> and <b>resins.</b> Kerogen alteration and hydrocarbon generation are unaffected by the mineral composition of the chalk, suggesting that the dominant controls on the rate of alteration and the composition of hydrocarbons generated are the type of organic matter and thermal history of the rocks.

The Austin Chalk reservoirs petroleum sourced within the formation and petroleum that has migrated into the chalk from elsewhere in the chalk and the underlying Eagleford Formation.

The method is built {{on the basis of}} calculation the physico-chemical characteristics and the group composition of vacuum distillate according to the fractional composition and density considering with high content of saturated hydrocarbons in the fraction.

5000|$|Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers, low-performance, the {{low-cost}} {{and most}} common {{material for the}} glue sticks (e.g., the light amber colored Thermogrip GS51, GS52, and GS53). They provide sufficient strength between 30 and 50 °C but are limited to use below 60-80 °C and have low creep resistance under load. The vinyl acetate monomer content is about 18-29 percent by weight of the polymer. High amounts of tackifiers and waxes are often used; an example composition is 30-40% of EVA copolymer (provides strength and toughness), 30-40% of tackifier resin (improves wetting and tack), 20-30% of wax (usually paraffin-based; reduces viscosity, alters setting speed, reduces cost), and 0.5-1% of stabilizers. Fillers can be added for special applications. Can be formulated for service temperatures ranging from −40 to +80 °C, and for both short and long open times and {{a wide range of}} melt viscosities. High stability at elevated temperatures and resistance to ultraviolet radiation, which can be further enhanced with suitable stabilizers. High vinylacetate content can serve for formulating a hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesive (HMPSA). EVA formulations are compatible with paraffin. EVA was the base for the original hot melt composition. The composition of the copolymer influences its properties; increased content of ethylene promotes adhesion to nonpolar substrates such as polyethylene, while increased content of vinyl acetate promotes adhesion to polar substrates such as paper. Higher ethylene content also increases mechanical strength, block resistance, and paraffin solubility. Higher vinyl acetate content provides higher flexibility, adhesion, hot tack, and better low-temperature performance. Adhesive grade EVA usually contains 14-35% vinyl acetate. Lower molecular weight chains provide lower melt viscosity, better wetting, and better adhesion to porous surfaces. Higher molecular weights provide better cohesion at elevated temperatures and better low-temperature behavior. Increased ratio of vinyl acetate lowers the crystallinity of the material, improves optical clarity, flexibility and toughness, and worsens resistance to solvents. EVA can be crosslinked by, e.g., peroxides, yielding a thermosetting material. EVAs can be compounded with aromatic <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>resins.</b> Grafting butadiene to EVA improves its adhesion. Its dielectric properties are poor due to high content of polar groups, the dielectric loss is moderately high. Polypropylene HMAs are a better choice for high-frequency electronics. EVAs are optically clearer and more gas and vapor permeable than polyolefins. Nearly half of EVA HMAs is used in packaging applications. Cryogenic grinding of EVAs can provide small, water-dispersible particles for heat-seal applications. EVA can degrade primarily by loss of acetic acid and formation of a double bond in the chain, and by oxidative degradation. EVA can be compounded into a wide range of HMAs, from soft pressure-sensitive adhesives to rigid structural adhesives for furniture construction.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to describe and assess the main results in the process of bioremediation of 479 m 3 of petroleum residuals spilled on the soil and restrained into four deposits of fuel on the coastal zone of “Punta Majagua”, Cienfuegos. The volume of hydrocarbons spilled and contained into the tanks was determined by means of their previous mixture with fertile ground in a ratio of 3 / 1. The hydrocarbons were disposed in a bioremediation area of 115 m X 75 m built in situ. In turn 54, 5 m 3 of BIOIL - FC were applied, which were fermented in an industrial bioreactor of 12000 L. An initial sampling was carried out registering values of total hydrocarbons (HTP) higher than 41880 mg/kg, with high concentrations of Saturated <b>hydrocarbons,</b> aromatics, <b>resins,</b> asphaltens (SARA). Three subsequent samples were taken with a sampling interval of 0, 45, 90 and 120 days of the application. An average concentration of 1884. 57 mg/kg of total hydrocarbons was obtained at 120 days with an average removal rate of 94. 8 %, moreover values of 94. 6 %, 90. 78 %, 86. 99 % y 79. 9 % of SARA were respectively reported...|$|R
5000|$|Doelter {{reported}} the following composition for the samples which were extracted in 1874 (air-dry basis): 78.25% carbon, 8.14% hydrogen, 13.19% oxygen and 0.42% sulfur. The specific gravity was determined 1.133. The sample was in alcohol sparingly soluble in benzene. Doelter noted a certain similarity of the analyzed sample resin to Walchowit, gave the resin {{but because of}} the opposite Walchowit significantly higher oxygen content and because of some differing physical properties has its own name. He has classified Duxit in the category of Retinite fossil resins. Already {{in the middle of the}} 20th century, Duxit was known as the [...] "Resinous bitumen".Modern methods of investigation, such as the infrared spectroscopy shows that duxit is not a pure resin, but a mixture of saturated <b>hydrocarbons</b> and plant <b>resins</b> and waxes.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} offormulation components on the physical, {{mechanical and}} optical properties of hot melt thermoplastic road markings was studied. To minimize {{the number of}} experiments, mixture method {{was used as an}} effective tool for experimentaldesign. Binder (rosin ester and <b>hydrocarbon</b> based <b>resins),</b> pigment (TiO 2), filler (talc) and plasticizer (long oil alkyd resin and dibutyl phthalate) were taken into consideration as the key factors at different levels. A range offormulations were prepared by melt blending of variables and other required components. Softening point temperature (Tsp) and its changes (ΔTsp), Taber abrasion resistance, color difference (ΔE) before and after exposure to the accelerated weathering conditions and heat stability test, were chosen as the key responses. A window of optimum end-use properties of thermoplastic road marking formulations was narrowed down within the range of desired responses in quadratic model using DX v. 7. 1. 3 program. The results showed that the optimized formulations were very close to those from the regression analysis, and the mixture experimental design was an effectual method to optimize the composition of a thermoplastic road marking formulation with respect to its properties. The precision of the model was evaluated by preparing two samples in the optimized window and comparing the predicted and actual properties. The results showed a good agreement between the proposed model and experimental measurements...|$|R
40|$|We study {{chemical}} {{aging in}} "COOEE bitumen" using molecular dynamic simulations. This model bitumen {{is composed of}} four realistic molecule types: saturated <b>hydrocarbon,</b> resinous oil, <b>resin,</b> and asphaltene. The aging reaction is modelled by the chemical reaction: " 2 resins → 1 asphaltene". Molecular dynamic simulations of four bitumen compositions, obtained by a repeated application of the aging reaction, are performed. The stress autocorrelation function, the fluid structure, the rotational dynamics of the plane aromatic molecules, and the diffusivity of each molecule, are determined for the four different compositions. The aging reaction causes a significant dynamics slowdown, which is correlated to the aggregation of asphaltene molecules in larger and dynamically slower nanoaggregates. Finally, {{a detailed description of}} the role of each molecule types in the aggregation and aging processes is given. Comment: 36 pages, 15 figure...|$|R
40|$|Crude oil is a naturally-occurring liquid mixture, {{composed}} of hydrocarbons {{as well as}} oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur-containing compounds. While previous research {{has been able to}} identify broad differences between classes of crude oil, the elucidating the structure of compounds within oils remains elusive, especially for heavier compounds. To determine the composition of Boscan, a heavy crude oil, SARA fractionation was performed to separate the sample into 4 different classes of chemical compounds: saturated <b>hydrocarbons,</b> aromatic compounds, <b>resins,</b> and asphaltenes. A sample of oil was chromatographically separated on activated alumina using solvents of increasing polarity. Each fraction was analyzed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Several series of hydrocarbons were seen in each fraction, separated by m/z and polarity. GC-separated isomers were seen in several of the samples. While all samples emitted between 320 and 540 nm, the wavelength of maximum emission changed between fractions, exhibiting redshifted and blueshifted spectra. This correlates well with crude oil samples found in the literature, which emit between 400 nm and 500 nm range, attributable to large conjugated aromatic structures (with a minimum of three rings) ...|$|R
