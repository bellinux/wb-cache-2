40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{cytotoxicity}} of chlordane (industrial product as insecticide), the effect on oxidative phosphorylation in rat liver mitochondria was studied. The respiration rate. RCI and ADP/O ratio were inhibited by chlordane related compounds, {{and the degree of}} inhibition was in the descending order of trans-chlordane, cis-chlordane, heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide. Of the indexes indicating various respiratory activities, state 3 respiration was the most sensitively inhibited by these compounds, suggesting their energy transfer inhibition. However, electron transport was also inhibited by high concentrations of chlordane constituents. The inhibitory effect of the chlordane constituents on respiratory activity varied depending on the species of respiratory substrate, suggesting site specificity of these compounds. Trans-chlordane, cis-chlordane and heptachlor stimulated Mg(2 +) ATPase activity and inhibited DNP-stimulated ATPase activity. <b>Heptachlorepoxide,</b> a metabolic product of heptachlor, has less effect on mitochondria than heptachlor...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{residues}} of 17 organochlorine {{pollutants in}} coral reef skeleton (Acropora sp.) collected from 20 different locations in April 1999 from Egyptian Red Sea Coast {{were analyzed by}} GC. The pollu-tants studied were α-, β-, γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCHs), Cyclo-dienes (heptachlor, aldrin, dieldrin, <b>heptachlorepoxide)</b> as well as sum DDT (p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD, and p,p'-DDT) and seven individual poly-chlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) congeners. The concentrations of sum DDT were in a range from 1 to 12 ng g 1 with an average 6 ng g 1. The highest DDT concentrations were recorded at Sharm El-Maya (St. No. 11), whereas the PCB levels ranged from 6. 2 to 48. 3 ng g 1 with an average 18. 9 ng g 1 and HCHs level ranged from 0. 8 to 14. 5 ng g 1 with an average 4 ng g 1. The PCBs were dominant in most studied locations. The present results indicate low to moderate PCBs and pesticides contamination {{in most of the}} studied coral reef samples...|$|E
40|$|The {{degree of}} {{contamination}} and pollution of some rivers in Western Nigeria by organochlorine and polychlorinated Pesticide Residues were investigated. The oirganochlorine and polychlorinated pesticides analysed showed total DDT (Dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane), ranged from ND – 0. 3953 ppb. Aldrin and lindane were {{detected in the}} range of 0. 0029 – 0. 1904 ppb and 0. 0067 – 0. 6341 ppb respectively. Total Polychlorinated biphenyl’s (PBB) level; ranged from ND – 8. 9916 ppb. Other Organochlorine Pesticides analysed gave varying levels of <b>heptachlorepoxide,</b> (range ND – 0. 0037 ppb), hexachlorobenzene (range ND – 0. 0092 ppb), endosulfan (range ND – 0. 0851 ppb) and dieldrin (range 0. 0049 – 0 : 6590 ppb) respectively. The organochlorine and polychlorinated pesticide residue peaks were identified by comparison with some reference mixed standard run under the same conditions.

30|$|Within the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) {{for some}} {{chemicals}} in biota (EQSbiota) have been set, and measures {{have to be}} taken by the member states if an EQS is exceeded [2]. The European Commission has strengthened the significance for monitoring bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms by amending the EQS directive in August 2013 [3]: The directive states that ‘very hydrophobic substances accumulate in biota and are hardly detectable in water even using the most advanced analytical techniques. For such substances, EQS should be set for biota‘. As a consequence, in addition to hexachlorobenzene, hexachlorobutadiene and mercury, EQSbiota have been set for eight new priority substances or substance groups. These include polybrominated diphenyl ethers, fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, dicofol, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and its derivatives, dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), as well as heptachlor and <b>heptachlorepoxide.</b> EQS for new priority substances {{have to be taken}} into account for monitoring programs that have to be submitted by the end of 2018 and have to be complied with by the end of 2027.|$|E
40|$|Chlordane {{is widely}} used as an anti-termite {{pesticide}} for wooden houses. Pest control operators {{as well as the}} residents of chlordane treated houses might become sick through the exposure to the chemical. The chlordane concentration in the air and soil after the treatment was examined. The Chlordane concentration in the blood of pest control operators was also examined. A 40 % emulsion of chlordane was used together wigh a 2 % pestrolum emulsion as a sprinkling pesticide. Its constituents as determined by GC-ECD were in the descending order of trans-chloirdane, trans-nonachlor, cis-chlordane, γ-chlordene, heptachlor and cis-nonachlor. The Chlordane concentration in the air was the highest immediately after the treatment, and decreased gradually with the lapse of time. Heptachlor was the largest, and cis-nonachlor the smallest constituent of chlordane detected in the air. On the contrary, cis-nonachlor was the largest, and heptachlor the smallest contituent in the soil. This suggests that the exposure dose of heptachlor may be extreme. <b>Heptachlorepoxide</b> and oxychlordane as metabolites, and trans-nonachlor and cis-nonachlor were detected in the blood of pest control operators.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of persistent toxic substances (PTS) in China and possibly their regional transport in the Yellow and East China Seas region was studied. Organochlorines in atmospheric gas-phase and particulate matter {{were collected by}} high-volume sampling (filters and polyurethane foams) during 2 weeks in June 2003 (dry season) simultaneously at a Yellow Sea coastal site in an urban area, Qingdao, China, and a rural island site, Gosan, Jeju Island, Korea. Using GC methods, the samples were analysed for 9 persistent organic pollutants (POPs) regulated under the global POP convention, namely aldrin, chlordane (cis- and trans-isomers CC and TC), DDT and metabolites (o,p 0 -DDT, p,p 0 -DDD, and p,p 0 -DDE), dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), mirex and PCB (congeners number 28, 52, 101, 153 and 180), and for hexachlorocyclohexane (a-, b- and g-isomers), a PTS and now considered for regulation under the convention, too.

40|$|I exposed rats to chlordane (industrial product) and {{measured}} {{the concentration of}} chlordane in various tissues of rats over time. Exposure to chlordane for 3. 5 hours appoximated the exposure to chlordane in a house a hundred days after treatment for termites. However, chlordane and metabolites were detected in all the tissues of rats. The concentration of chlordane in various tissues showed highest level one hour after exposure. After that, heptachlor, γ-chlordane, trans-chlordane and cis-chlordane were excreted fast, while trans-noachlor and cis-nonachlor were excreted extremely slowly. The metabolites of chlordane (<b>heptachlorepoxide</b> and oxichlordane) showed the highest level one after exposure in the various tissues, and after that they were excreted slowly. Chlordane had the highest level in the adipose tissue and the second highest level in the liver, kidney, lung, pectoral muscle and heart. In the spleen and brain it showed a relatively low level. The lowest level was in the blood. As for Biological Harf Life (B. H. L.), {{the number of days}} in the secondary excretion in the adipose tissue of chlordane excreted late was as follows: trans-nonachlor 38. 5 days, cis-nonachlor 16. 5 days, and metabolites 16. 9 days.

40|$|Abstract: Catfish (Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus) and mullet (Liza grandisquamis) were sampled from Lagos Lagoon and Agboyi Creek and {{analysed}} for alpha-BHC, beta-BHC, lindane, delta-BHC, heptachlor, <b>heptachlorepoxide</b> (B), aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, endrin aldehyde, endrin ketone, cis-chlordane, trans-chlordane, endosulfan 1, endosulfan 11, endosulfan sulphate, methoxychlor, p,p´-DDE, p,p´-DDD and p,p´-DDT. Sampling was conducted four {{times at the}} designated sites {{during the dry season}} months of December 2008 and February 2009 and the wet season months of May and September 2009. The muscle tissues and organs of the finfishes were subjected to cold extraction with petroleum ether/acetone (1 : 1 v/v) mixture and clean-up on silica gel adsorbents. A gas chromatograph coupled with electron capture detector (GC-ECD) was used to detect and determine the organochlorines. The residue levels of the fishes were higher in the Lagos Lagoon than in Agboyi Creek while a higher concentration of the residues was observed during the dry season. The female fishes accumulated higher organochlorines than the male fishes. The order of residue accumulation in the organs of the fishes was gills > livers > large intestines > small intestines > kidneys > muscles. The dietary surveys indicated that the amount of fishes consumed ranged from 20 to 200 g/day, with a mean value of 40 g/day. The estimated daily intakes of the organochlorines were within the acceptable daily intakes while the levels of residues in the fishes were within the permissible residue limits...|$|E
40|$|The chlorohydrocarbon {{pesticides}} (CHPs) (principally DDT, dieldrin, hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) including lindane, chlordane, heptachlor and <b>heptachlorepoxide,</b> aldrin and hexachlorobenzene (HCB)) {{were used}} extensively in Australia during the 1960 s and 1970 s. These were progressively {{banned from the}} 1970 s with DDT being totally banned in 1987. The levels in marine waters {{are believed to have}} progressively declined as indicated by water in the Brisbane River, which consistently fell from maximum concentrations of about 1. 7 姯l in 1972 - 1973 to not detectable in 1986 - 1987. In some urban areas sediment concentrations, up to 1700 姯kg dry weight, were recorded in the early 1990 s which may reflect the reworking and exposure of older more contaminated material. Fish exhibited consistent occurrence of DDT, HCH, dieldrin and HCB through the 1970 s to the 1990 s. Maximum concentrations of DDT and dieldrin occurred generally in the 1970 s at 40. 3 and 8. 8 姯g wet weight, and minimums in the 1990 s at 2. 4 and 0. 041 姯g wet weight respectively. Inputs of dialdrin from sewage and DDT from the broad environment, reflected by the calculated daily human uptake in the diet, were shown to decline with half-lives of 1. 1 - 1. 5 and about 3 years respectively. This evidence suggests that banning of the CHPs has greatly reduced the inputs into the marine environment with consequent reductions in concentrations in biota but there is the occasional occurrence of relatively high concentrations.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of persistent toxic substances (PTS) in China and possibly their regional transport in the Yellow and East China Seas region was studied. Organochlorines in atmospheric gas-phase and particulate matter {{were collected by}} high-volume sampling (filters and polyurethane foams) during 2 weeks in June 2003 (dry season) simultaneously at a Yellow Sea coastal site in an urban area, Qingdao, China, and a rural island site, Gosan, Jeju Island, Korea. Using GC methods, the samples were analysed for 9 persistent organic pollutants (POPs) regulated under the global POP convention, namely aldrin, chlordane (cis- and trans-isomers CC and TC), DDT and metabolites (o,p’-DDT, p,p’-DDD, and p,p’-DDE), dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), mirex and PCB (congeners number 28, 52, 101, 153 and 180), and for hexachlorocyclohexane (α-, β- and γ-isomers), a PTS and now considered for regulation under the convention, too. At the coastal site additionally o,p’-DDE and -DDD, β-endosulfan, isodrin, <b>heptachlorepoxide</b> and d-HCH, and at the island site additionally p,p’-DDT and the PCB congeners number 77, 81, 114, 118, 123, 126, 138, 156, 167, 169, 170 and 189 were analysed. 9 samples were collected at the coastal and 15 (for PCBs 5) at the island site. Long-range advection pathways were determined based on analysed back-trajectory calculations. The mean concentrations of DDT and its metabolites, HCB, HCH, and PCB at the coast were in the 100 - 1000 pg m- 3 range. Higher concentrations prevailed during night-time. The levels were in general lower at the island site, but not for DDT. Local sources are likely. PCBs were even 2 orders og magnitude lower, suggesting that PCBs {{are not subject to}} regional transport but elevated concentrations in air are limited to the source areas. Organochlorine pesticide levels on the other hand were seemingly determined by regional transport over mainland China rather than by emissions in the coastal area. The currently used pesticides mirex and chlordane were found at elevated levels, i. e. 79 (6. 6 - 255) and 36 (< 6 - 71) pg m- 3, respectively, at the coast but not over the island. The POPs pesticides aldrin, dieldrin and eldrin, never registered in China, were mostly found at < 10 pg m- 3 except for eldrin at the coastal site (up to 400 pg m- 3) and aldrin at the island site (up to 50 pg m- 3) ...|$|E
