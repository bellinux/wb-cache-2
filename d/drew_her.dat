5|$|Selphie was {{the second}} {{character}} that Nomura drew, after Squall, intentionally giving her an impractical hairstyle. When he first designed Selphie, Nomura <b>drew</b> <b>her</b> in overalls; however, he realized {{that none of the}} characters would be wearing a skirt. In the end, he gave Selphie a mini-skirt and let Quistis have pants. In the Kingdom Hearts series, Nomura included a younger version of Selphie as a resident of Destiny Islands, and uses a jump rope instead of nunchaku. She is voiced by Mayuko Aoki in the Japanese version, and by Molly Marlette in the English version.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino {{was born}} on April 21, 1980, in Shiga Prefecture, Japan, as the younger of fraternal twin girls and the second of three children. As a child, she {{originally}} dreamed of becoming an astronaut. Hoshino confessed she was not too interested in school, often making excuses to avoid taking classes. Additionally, she added that would often practise drawing {{in the middle of}} the classes which gave her doubts when she had to erase them. She <b>drew</b> <b>her</b> first manga at twenty-one. In 1998, Hoshino moved to Tokyo. She dreamed of bringing her mother to the city and was able to in 2006. After graduating from high school, Hoshino did not know what career should she follow as she was offered the work of joining video game companies. Ultimately, she decided to become a manga author despite her fears of the difficulty it takes.|$|E
5|$|Under French law, both Sally and James {{could have}} petitioned for their freedom, as the 1789 revolutionary {{constitution}} in France abolished slavery in principle. Hemings had {{the legal right}} to remain in France as a free person; if she returned to Virginia with Jefferson, it would be as a slave. According to her son Madison's memoir, Hemings became pregnant by Jefferson in Paris. She was about 16 at the time. She agreed to return with him to the United States based on his promise to free their children when they reached the age of 21 years. Hemings' strong ties to her mother, siblings and extended family probably <b>drew</b> <b>her</b> back to Monticello.|$|E

5|$|Sarah's {{success as}} a leader of the {{opposition}} only intensified the Queen's animosity towards the Marlboroughs. Although she could not dismiss Sarah from Anne's service, Mary responded by evicting Sarah from her court lodgings at the Palace of Whitehall. Anne responded by leaving the court as well, and Sarah and she went to stay with their friends Charles Seymour, the sixth Duke of Somerset, and Elizabeth, the Duchess of Somerset at Syon House. Anne continued to defy the Queen’s demand for Sarah’s dismissal, even though an incriminating document signed by the Earl of Marlborough supporting the recently exiled James II and his supporters had been discovered. This document is likely to have been forged by Robert Young, a known forger and disciple of Titus Oates; Oates was famous for stirring a strongly anti-Catholic atmosphere in England between 1679 and the early 1680s. The Earl was imprisoned in the Tower of London. The loneliness Sarah suffered during these events <b>drew</b> <b>her</b> and Anne closer together.|$|E
5|$|Seeing Arnaud felled by gunfire, Magruder, who {{was wearing}} body armor, stepped back and <b>drew</b> <b>her</b> sidearm. However, before she could return fire, Logan then shot six bullets at her, one of which struck her in the head, mortally {{wounding}} her. Logan then went over to Arnaud and, while standing over his body, shot him four more times, injuring his liver and inducing severe internal bleeding. Arnaud would die from severe gunshot-induced blood loss at the scene, but the mortally wounded Magruder was able to call for assistance over her radio at 9:34p.m. Logan's father, {{who was in the}} house's master bedroom, had heard the gunshots, and thinking that the deputies had shot him, went over to see what had happened. Instead, he saw Logan leaving the house with a firearm in hand, and saw that the two deputies had been shot. Logan's father then called 9-1-1 via telephone at 9:39p.m. to report the shooting to authorities. Emergency medical technicians arrived and removed Arnaud and Magruder were removed from the house via stretchers, with Magruder being airlifted via medical helicopter to the Prince George's Hospital Center, with CPR being applied on her while en route. However, she would be pronounced dead at the hospital before midnight.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, when Fox was 16, {{her mother}} {{submitted}} several photographs {{that she had}} taken of her daughter in lingerie to The Sunday People newspaper's Girl of the Year amateur modelling contest.

25|$|Zina Young {{joined the}} Mormon Exodus to the Rocky Mountains, {{arriving}} in the Salt Lake Valley in September 1848. In Utah Territory, she would raise her two Jacobs sons, her daughter, and the four children of Brigham Young and Clara Ross with fierce independence and strength. She resisted {{the loss of her}} independence as Brigham <b>drew</b> <b>her,</b> physically and socially, into his vast household, and found herself very lonely once there. She relied heavily upon kinship ties to her brothers and sister {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
25|$|There {{followed}} {{some years}} of penury and struggle which are recounted in her autobiography published in 1934 She worked variously {{as a house}} maid, sold matches and hired a barrel organ to entertain crowds on Armistice Day in 1918 earning a meagre living for several years. In 1923, she spotted an opportunity with the long queues that used to form outside London theatres and cinemas and hired out chairs and stools for the waiting patrons to sit on, thereby earning the sobriquet 'Peggy the Chair Lady'. Her enterprise <b>drew</b> <b>her</b> into a criminal underworld that flourished {{in the aftermath of}} the Great War.|$|E

25|$|Other {{indication}} of his passionate nature concerns an affair he {{is believed to}} have had with the English socialite Lady Ottoline Morrell, beginning when they first met in July or August 1898. Ottoline was then an unmarried 25-year-old member of the privileged London social scene, while being at the same time slightly contemptuous of it. Her intellectual and spiritual interests <b>drew</b> <b>her</b> to more mature men, such as Herbert Asquith, particularly if they had a reputation for iconoclasm. She and Axel Munthe were drawn to each other, and managed to spend significant private time together on Capri.|$|E
25|$|Although Fossey {{had always}} been an {{exemplary}} student, she had difficulties with basic sciences including chemistry and physics, and failed her second year of the program. She transferred to San Jose State College where {{she was a member}} of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority to study occupational therapy, receiving her bachelor's degree in 1954. Initially following her college major, Fossey began a career in occupational therapy. She interned at various hospitals in California and worked with tuberculosis patients. Fossey was originally a prizewinning equestrian, which <b>drew</b> <b>her</b> to Kentucky in 1955, and a year later took a job as an occupational therapist at the Kosair Crippled Children's Hospital in Louisville.|$|E
25|$|Five {{years later}} Ho {{published}} her third book, The Clay Marble. This time she <b>drew</b> <b>her</b> {{inspiration from the}} interaction with Cambodian refugees during her relief work on the Thai-Cambodian border. Once again, she presented a strong female protagonist, a twelve-year-old girl named Dara {{who was one of}} the thousands of refugees escaping to the border at the end of the Khmer Rouge regime when Vietnam invaded the country. She also employed the theme of family unity in the face of adversity, as Dara persuaded her elder brother not to join the army but to return with family, sans their father, to restart life back at home.|$|E

25|$|In May 1568 Mary, Queen of Scots fled to England, {{and flung}} herself on Elizabeth's protection. She had found refuge in Carlisle Castle, and the {{delicate}} duty of {{taking charge of}} the fugitive was entrusted jointly to Knollys and to Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton. On 28 May Knollys arrived at the castle, and was admitted to Mary's presence. At his first interview he was conscious of Mary's powerful fascination. But to her {{requests for an interview}} with Elizabeth, and for help to regain her throne, he returned the evasive answers which Elizabeth's advisers had suggested to him, and he frankly <b>drew</b> <b>her</b> attention to the suspicions in which Darnley's murder involved her.|$|E
500|$|Yet {{another version}} is {{presented}} by the Metropolitan Museum of Art (the Met) in their 1966 catalogue of French holdings, including September Morn. According to this telling, Chabas completed the painting over three summers at Lake Annecy, though his peasant model served only {{as the basis for}} the figure's body. The head was based on a sketch of a young American, Julie Phillips, which Chabas had completed upon observing her and her mother dining in Paris; finding her profile to his liking, he silently <b>drew</b> <b>her,</b> then introduced himself and [...] "apologized for his presumption".|$|E
500|$|The {{third and}} final episode in the series, , was {{released}} in 2006. Composed entirely by Kajiura, her style shifted from that of Episode II to be darker, with a larger focus on rhythm and less use of background vocals. The soundtrack {{has been described as}} [...] "melancholy" [...] and [...] "piano-driven". Despite moving from composing only the cinematic tracks in Episode II to composing the whole score for Episode III, Kajiura says that the difficulty of each game's score was about the same. She primarily <b>drew</b> <b>her</b> inspiration for the music from the game's artwork and her conception of the world the game was set in.|$|E

500|$|Emma {{is portrayed}} by actress Jayma Mays. In the third season episode [...] "Asian F", Hannah Spiros plays an eight-year-old Emma. Prior to her casting in Glee, Mays was already an {{established}} actress {{in both the}} television and film industry, but had little theatrical experience. In casting Glee, series creator Ryan Murphy sought actors who could identify with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Auditioning actors with no theatrical experience were required to prove they could sing and dance as well as act, and Mays auditioned with the song [...] "Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me" [...] from The Rocky Horror Show. Asked what originally <b>drew</b> <b>her</b> {{to the role of}} Emma, Mays said: ...|$|E
500|$|On 24January 1981, Hoe spotted Agnes at {{a nearby}} church and lured her to the flat. [...] The trio plied her with food and drink that was laced with Dalmadorm. [...] After Agnes became groggy and fell asleep, Lim sexually abused her. [...] Near midnight, the trio smothered Agnes with a pillow and <b>drew</b> <b>her</b> blood, {{drinking}} and smearing it on a portrait of Kali. [...] Following that, they drowned the girl by holding down her head in a pail of water. [...] Finally, Lim used his electro-shock therapy device to [...] "make doubly sure that she was dead". [...] They stuffed her body in a bag and dumped it near the lift at Block 11.|$|E
500|$|To {{demonstrate}} that the character is not perfect, Woolverton described [...] "a little wisp of hair that keeps falling in her face," [...] which was the only direction she used to describe Belle's physical appearance. Wanting Belle to be significantly different and more European in appearance than Ariel, the animators <b>drew</b> <b>her</b> with fuller lips, narrower eyes and darker eyebrows, which were inspired by the facial features of British actresses Vivien Leigh and Audrey Hepburn. More statuesque than most Disney princesses, Belle's appearance was inspired by that of American actress Jennie Garth. The animators also used photographs of Hollywood actresses Natalie Wood, Elizabeth Taylor and Grace Kelly for reference. Baxter studied the art of French impressionist Edgar Degas, a painter known for his portraits of ballerinas, whose work inspired the animator to incorporate [...] "graceful, swan-like movements" [...] into Belle's performance.|$|E
