25|$|For 1984, all Delta 88s {{were now}} Royale or Royale Brougham models. Styling {{highlights}} included new grille inserts {{and red and}} amber taillights replacing the red lenses. At mid-year, a new Royale Brougham LS {{was added to the}} 88 line almost simultaneous to the introduction of a new and downsized 1985 front-wheel drive Ninety-Eight. With the Ninety-Eight being downsized and converted to front-drive, the Royale Brougham LS model of the 88 was now the largest and most luxurious rear-wheel drive car offered by Oldsmobile. Custom Cruiser wagons continued with the same styling changes found on other 88 models.

25|$|The stadium {{does not}} have a {{retractable}} roof, though one was considered initially. Such a roof was cited to add $100 million to the total budget and none of the parties (Twins, Hennepin County or Minnesota Legislature) were willing to pay for that cost. Much like other northern cities with outdoor professional baseball (i.e. Chicago, Detroit, Boston, Cleveland, New York), the weather in Minneapolis during a 162-game baseball season and playoffs can vary from early-spring snow to rain and hot, humid weather. The Metrodome was climate-controlled, and thus, protected the baseball schedule during the entire time that it had been the venue for the Minnesota Twins. However, many Twins fans and baseball purists argue that this same sterile, climate-controlled environment creates a less-than-desirable atmosphere for watching baseball. The architect also tested the feasibility of <b>heated</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{general layout}} of the House was largely {{untouched}} from the previous non-celebrity series. The living room and bedroom had no noticeable changes. There were several single beds in the same room, with one double bed, meaning that two housemates (Leo and Donny) had to share. The bathroom is much smaller than previous versions and the toilet and shower were no longer fitted with cameras. The dining room table was moved inside, and the kitchen fully equipped with modern conveniences. Outside the garden was a three-jet hot tub with a farmyard seating area. The bridge to Nowhere was still present, leading to a sitting area with <b>heated</b> <b>seats</b> and the topiary man. A workout area was situated just off the kitchen area. Inside the House {{there was also a}} fax machine built into the wall. On day 24 this was used to post viewers' questions to the housemates. Meanwhile, the Diary Room was identical to the previous summer's Big Brother, with an oversized gold chair and padded walls, the only change being the addition of yellow lights facing the walls.|$|E

50|$|High-tech {{toilet seats}} may include many features, {{including}} a <b>heated</b> <b>seat,</b> a bidet, and a blow drier. High-tech seats are {{most common in}} Japan, where a seat with integrated bidets is colloquially called a Washlet, after a leading brand. Electrically <b>heated</b> toilet <b>seats</b> have been popular in Japan since the 1970s. Since Japanese bathrooms are often unheated, the toilet seat sometimes doubles as a space heater. Integrated bidets date from around 1980, and have since become very popular in Japan, and are becoming more common in most other developed countries.|$|R
