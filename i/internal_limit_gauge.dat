40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the selectivity {{and strength of}} intraoperative trypan blue staining during removal of epiretinal membranes (ERMs) and the <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane. Methods: Based on intraoperative videos, 51 consecutive chromovitrectomies in 51 patients with macular holes, macular pucker, vitreomacular traction syndromes, or persistent macular edema were retrospectively studied. Fifteen subjects underwent trypan blue, 14 indocyanine green, and 22 brilliant blue G chromovitrectomy. The main outcome measure was the color contrast between stained <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane or ERM and the underlying unstained tissue by means of objective, quantitative, semiautomated chromaticity difference measurements. Results: Trypan blue stains both ERM and the <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane (average chromaticity scores 8. 51 and 7. 09, respectively; P = 0. 48). <b>Internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane chromaticity scores were similar for trypan blue (7. 09) and brilliant blue G (6. 81; P = 0. 71) but clearly higher for indocyanine green (15. 81; P = 2. 45 · 10 − 5).

40|$|Idiopathic macular hole is a {{full-thickness}} defect of the neurosensory retina {{which can}} be treated by three-port vitrectomy. The pathogenesis is not understood completely, but tangential traction of the vitreous and retinal surface may cause opening of a macular hole. Vitrectomy with or without <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane peeling may relieve the tangential traction. The anatomical success rate is 58 - 85 % without <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane peeling and 88 - 95 % with <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane peeling. A high success rate was achieved in patients who had surgery within 6 months of the onset of symptoms. Among the complications were retinal breaks, retinal detachment, retinal pigment epitheliopathy, and visual field defect, the most serious complication. Temporal visual field defect can be eliminated by reducing the fluid-gas exchange time and stabilizing intraocular pressure during surgery.

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} macular retinal ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness changes after Brilliant Blue G-assisted <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane peeling for idiopathic macular hole repair using a high-resolution spectral-domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (SD-OCT). Methods. 32 {{eyes from}} 32 patients with idiopathic macular holes who underwent vitrectomy with <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane peeling between January 2011 and July 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. GCIPL thickness was measured before surgery, and at one month and at six months after surgery. Values obtained from automated and semimanual SD-OCT segmentation analysis were compared (Cirrus HD-OCT, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). Results. No {{significant differences were found}} between average GCIPL thickness values between preoperative and postoperative analysis. However, statistical significant differences were found in GCIPL thickness at the temporal macular quadrants at six months after surgery. Quality measurement analysis performed by automated segmentation revealed a significant number of segmentation errors. Semimanual segmentation slightly improved the quality of the results.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness changes in eyes undergoing trypan blue-assisted macular surgery using optical coherence tomography- 3. This is a prospective noncomparative, interventional, and observational case series of 35 eyes of 35 consecutive patients (15 eyes with macular hole, 14 eyes with idiopathic macular pucker, and 6 eyes with tractional diabetic macular edema) who underwent pars plana vitrectomy and peeling of the epiretinal membrane and/or <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane assisted with 0. 1 mL of 0. 15 % trypan blue. Methods: The quantitative analysis of the peripapillary RNFL by optical coherence tomography was performed before surgery and 6 months postoperatively in both eyes of the same patient. The main outcome measures were significant changes in RNFL thickness (overall and by quadrant). Results: Optical coherence tomography assessment of the macular status at 6 months postoperatively showed closure of all macular holes and improvement in foveal contour in all cases of macular pucker or most cases of diabetic macular edema. Dissociated RNFL at the area of <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane removal was observed in 9 eyes. No statistical significant changes in the mean RNFL thickness overall or by quadrant were observed after surgery. Conclusion: Trypan blue-assisted peeling of macular epiretinal membranes and/or <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane does not induce significant changes in RNFL thickness as measured by optical coherence tomography- 3. <b>Internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane peeling may induce visible changes of the inner retinal surface possibly because of microdefects on macular nerve fiber layers.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of a 66 -year-old man with a history of high myopia and who was {{referred}} for acute decreased visual acuity of the right eye. Fundus examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a mild epiretinal membrane (ERM) and splitting of retinal layers. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed with intravitreous triamcinolone injection, posterior hyaloid and ERM peeling, and 12 % perfluoropropane (C 3 F 8) gas tamponade. After remaining asymptomatic for 17 months, the patient reported a new episode of sudden decreased visual acuity in his right eye, and OCT showed recurrent myopic foveoschisis (MF). He underwent vitrectomy and <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane (ILM) peeling. Six months later, the patient&# 8217;s best corrected visual acuity had improved to 20 / 25. Optical coherence tomography showed a remarkably improved macular anatomy, with residual traction along the inferotemporal arcade, which was attributed to the vessel stiffness itself. We conclude that removing the <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane is a challenging maneuver in myopic foveoschisis, even with staining approaches. Although myopic foveoschisis may be resolved without peeling the <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane, its removal should be considered if the condition recurs...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE:: To {{evaluate}} the incidence, clinical features, and outcomes of macular hole formation after pars plana vitrectomy with <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane peeling {{for the management}} of epiretinal membrane. METHODS:: Retrospective consecutive chart review of 423 cases. RESULTS:: Eleven subjects developed postoperative macular holes (incidence 2. 6 %; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 5 - 4. 6 %). Two of the 11 subjects developed central macular holes (incidence 0. 5 %; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 1 - 1. 7 %) while 9 had eccentric (nonfoveal) macular holes (incidence 2. 1 %; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 1 - 4. 0 %). Seven of the 9 eccentric macular holes were < 115 μm in diameter, 7 were determined to be along the margin of the <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane peel, and 8 were either in the superior or temporal macula. The two central macular holes were closed with subsequent pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade. There was no association between macular hole formation and age, gender, preoperative visual acuity, axial length, and preoperative central macular thickness. Overall, a 0. 2 or more improvement in logMAR was associated with pseudophakia and poorer preoperative acuity on univariate and multivariate analysis, whereas increased preoperative central macular thickness was associated with improved outcomes on univariate but not multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION:: Postoperative macular hole formation is an infrequent sequela to pars plana vitrectomy with <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane peeling for epiretinal membrane. In our cohort, eccentric macular holes tended to be small, located {{along the edge of the}} <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane peel, and were not visually significant. © by Opthamic Communication Society, Inc.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the reliability of}} surgeons in estimating <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane peeling area during epiretinal membrane surgery and to evaluate their ability to remove a predetermined <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane surface. Methods: One senior surgeon and two junior surgeons were asked to reach a target <b>internal</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane peeling surface (ILMPS) with an eccentricity of 1 optic disk diameter (centered on the fovea) in patients undergoing epiretinal membrane surgery. The ILMPS was measured on video recordings during epiretinal membrane surgery with no dye and then after brilliant blue G staining. Results: Thirty patients were included. Median (interquartile range) ILMPS was 9. 3 mm(2) (5. 7 - 16. 3 mm(2)) and 7. 4 mm 2 (3. 7 - 16. 4 mm(2)) before and after brilliant blue G, respectively (P = 0. 17). The ILMPS was significantly larger in eyes operated by the senior surgeon than in those operated by the junior surgeons (P = 0. 01). The senior surgeon reached the target ILMPS more often than the junior surgeons: 87 % versus 47 %, respectively (P = 0. 02).
