2500|$|The Mk VB(trop) (or type 352) {{could be}} {{identified}} by the large Vokes air filter fitted under the nose; the reduced speed of the air to the supercharger had a detrimental effect {{on the performance of}} the aircraft, reducing the top speed by 8mph (13km/h) and the climb rate by 600ft/min (3.04m/s), but the decreased performance was considered acceptable. This variant was also fitted with a larger oil tank and desert survival gear behind the pilot's seat. A new [...] "desert" [...] camouflage scheme was applied. Many VB(trop)s were modified by 103 MU (Maintenance Unit-RAF depots in which factory fresh aircraft were brought up to service standards before being delivered to squadrons) at Aboukir, Egypt by replacing the Vokes filter with locally manufactured [...] "Aboukir" [...] filters, which were lighter and more streamlined. Two designs of these filters can be identified in photos: one had a bulky, squared off <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> while the other was more streamlined. These aircraft were usually fitted with the wide blade Rotol propeller and clipped wings.|$|E

50|$|The 1982 CR480 {{had about}} 52 {{horsepower}} and was quite light for its horsepower, at about 226 pounds. Magnesium parts {{were used for}} weight saving and the bike had a hand-riveted air-box/air <b>filter</b> <b>housing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Air {{is drawn}} into the engine through two air filters located above each {{cylinder}} head. The amount of the air is metered by two hot film mass air flow sensors B2/6&7. On Sprinter models, a single air <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> is mounted upon brackets {{on top of the}} engine.|$|E

50|$|The new 2015 Toyota HiLux {{receives}} {{a slightly different}} version of the single VVT-i engine, with the only change being a removal of an air intake baffle tank being replaced by a conventional air <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> to intake pipe to surge tank style. The new intake pipe now contains resonators. Power output is unchanged.|$|E

50|$|A third {{common type}} of wrench {{utilizes}} a metal or plastic cup that is shaped much like a socket. The cup {{is placed on the}} end of the filter, which engages the knurling. A socket or wrench is then used to loosen the filter. Volkswagen Group and BMW cars require this type of wrench to remove their filters (or the lid of the <b>filter</b> <b>housing,</b> where a non-cartridge filter is used).|$|E
50|$|When {{installed}} in the BMW E30, a two-piece oil pan with a removable front sump was fitted to the M42. In this two-piece arrangement, the upper oil pan casting incorporates the oil pump's supply passage, and is sealed to the crankcase oil <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> with a paper gasket. This can cause problems, because thermal cycles and engine vibration tend to loosen the six 10mm upper pan mounting bolts inside the motor.|$|E
5000|$|The GA16DNE is a Mexican-specification 1.6 litre (1597 cc) engine, which {{produces}} [...] The main {{differences between the}} DE and DNE are: the DNE has no VTC and no ECCS plenum.

50|$|The <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> {{consists}} of two metal or plastic cylinders sitting {{one on top of}} the other. The upper one has a lid and can be filled with impure water. In the bottom of the upper cylinder are one or more holes fitted with porcelain filter columns. The water is forced through the filters by gravity, and then trickles down to the lower cylinder where it is stored and tapped off as required.|$|E
50|$|The M90 {{engine is}} a lower {{performance}} SOHC engine {{that was based}} on the M88/1. It utilizes the same block from the M88 and maintains the same bore and stroke, but borrows its head from the BMW M30 engine family. Different years of M90 engines used both Bosch Motronic and Bosch L-Jetronic engine management systems.Typically identified by a white L painted on the block behind the oil <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> and coolant water passages {{on the side of the}} block.|$|E
50|$|These filters use sand as the {{filtering}} medium. Sand filters {{look like}} large balls and they hold hundred {{of pounds of}} sterile sand. Water flows {{into the top of}} the <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> and makes its way down through the sand bed where the sharp edges of the sand catch the particulates. On a micron-to-micron comparison, sand filters remove the least amount of dirt - particles as small as 20 to 25 microns. However, sand filters certainly are efficient enough to keep just about any pool clean.|$|E
50|$|Abutting {{the upper}} {{reservoir}} to its north are {{the ruins of}} a <b>filter</b> <b>house,</b> which purified water for domestic purposes. The incoming water flowed through a concoction of charcoal and sandstone before it was channeled via an aqueduct to the lower reservoir.|$|R
40|$|The tilt {{after-effect}} (TAE) {{is thought}} to be a manifestation of gain control in mechanisms selective for spatial orientation in visual stimuli. It has been demonstrated with luminance-defined stripes, contrast-defined stripes, orientation-defined stripes, and even with natural images. Of course, all images can be decomposed into a sum of stripes, so it should not be surprising to find a TAE when adapting and test images contain stripes that differ by 15 Â° or so. We show this latter condition is not necessary for the TAE with natural images: adaptation to slightly tilted and vertically <b>filtered</b> <b>houses</b> produced a ârepulsiveâ bias in the perceived orientation of horizontally <b>filtered</b> <b>houses.</b> These results suggest gain control in mechanisms selective for spatial orientation in natural images...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} other notable {{buildings}} in the village. The former Wesleyan chapel on Mill Lee Road was built in 1817 and now serves as the offices for Bradfield Parish Council. Just across the road is another former Wesleyan chapel which was built in 1899 to replace its counterpart. It closed in 1993 and was sold for residential use. Also on Mill Lee Road are the former water board <b>filter</b> <b>houses</b> which <b>filtered</b> water from the Agden, Dale Dike and Strines reservoirs in Bradfield Dale. The <b>filter</b> <b>houses</b> were built in 1913 and extended in 1953 before being closed in 1995 when a new water treatment works was opened in the Loxley Valley. The buildings are derelict and unused at present. The Bradfield village hall, situated on the Memorial Field was completely rebuilt recently and re-opened in 2006.|$|R
