5000|$|In {{the early}} 1900s Ethel Standiford-Mehlingan was an {{experimental}} photographer and artist {{and owner of}} the Standiford Studio in Louisville, Kentucky. She was commissioned by Louisville artist and art patron Eleanor Belknap Humphrey to create an autochrome <b>diascope</b> of her two oldest children. Both the autochrome photograph of the Humphrey children and the <b>diascope</b> mirror viewing device, which closes into itself in a leather-bound case similar in size and appearance to a book, are well preserved and still viewable in 2015. Ethel Standiford-Mehlingan later moved her Louisville enterprise Standiford Studios to Cleveland, Ohio [...] and it is not known if any other examples of her autochrome diascopes still exist.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{difficult}} to manufacture and relatively expensive, Autochromes were {{relatively easy to}} use and were immensely popular among enthusiastic amateur photographers—at least, among those who could bear the cost and were willing to sacrifice the convenience of hand-held [...] "snapshooting" [...] in black-and-white. Autochromes failed to sustain the initial interest of more serious [...] "artistic" [...] practitioners, largely due to their inflexibility. Not only did the need for <b>diascopes</b> and projectors make them extremely {{difficult to}} publicly exhibit, they allowed {{little in the way of}} the manipulation much loved by aficionados of the then-popular Pictorialist approach.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{production}} series featured several improvements. The {{most important of}} these was the fitting of the APX 4 turret, equipped with the longer SA 35 gun, which had a far better antitank-capacity, with about twice the original armour penetration. Due to the longer rounds the ammunition load decreased to 108 rounds. The new turret also had PPLR X 160 episcopes instead of Chrétien <b>diascopes</b> and was fitted with a S 190 G attachment point on the roof above the back hatch, to use the reserve machine gun as an AA-weapon. Analogous to the Char B1 bis designation for the similarly improved second Char B1 version, some internal unit documents in 1940 began to refer to the second series as the [...] "Char D2 bis", but this was never an official name.|$|R
50|$|The APX-R turret was {{the same}} {{standard}} type as used on the R35 and R40 tanks, made of 40 mm cast steel and armed with the short 37 mm SA 18 gun, which had a maximum armour penetration of only 23 mm. Traverse of the turret was with a handwheel. The commander sat in a saddle suspended from the turret.The tank carried about 100 rounds for the gun, and 2,400 rounds for the coaxial 7.5 mm Reibel machine gun - the 37 mm ammunition racked on the left hand side of the hull, the 7.5 mm ammunition {{on the right side}} in fifteen circular magazines with 150 rounds each; a final magazine was to be at the ready on the machine-gun itself. The turret had a rotating cupola with a PPL RX 180 P visor but there was no hatch in the cupola though its top could be lifted a bit for better ventilation. Apart from the cupola there were protected vision devices, a binocular periscope and <b>diascopes,</b> to the front beside the gun and to each side. For access there was a hatch {{at the back of the}} turret. When opened, the commander could sit on it for better observation, but this left him very vulnerable and slow to reach the gun. The alternative was to fight closed-up, observing through the vertical slits or the visor of the hatchless cupola. The Cavalry liked neither this arrangement nor the weak gun. The latter problem was lessened somewhat by enlarging the breech so that special rounds with a larger charge could be used. This increased muzzle velocity to about 600 m/s and maximum penetration to about 30 mm. Only a small part of the tanks with the Cavalry alone were modified however, because it greatly increased barrel wear. In the Spring of 1940 the original <b>diascopes</b> of the Chrétien type were gradually replaced with episcopes, offering more protection.|$|R
50|$|Edis {{took her}} first {{autochrome}} portrait in 1912 and became {{known for her}} colour photography. Edis patented her own <b>diascope,</b> a device for viewing autochromes which allowed them to be backlit. Edis won a medal with her autochrome, Portrait Study, at the Royal Photographic Society's 1913 exhibition, and became {{a fellow of the}} Society the next year.|$|E
50|$|Ethel Standiford-Mehlingan (1871 - 1963) was {{an artist}} and {{photographer}} born in Jackson County, Kentucky, in the late 19th century. She studied {{to be a teacher}} but instead apprenticed to a photographer. By 1901 she owned and operated the Standiford Photographic Studio in Louisville, Kentucky. In {{the early part of the}} 20th century she experimented with early photographic techniques such as the autochrome Lumiere and photo-viewing devices such as the <b>diascope.</b> An example of her early photography is the autochrome Lumiere <b>diascope</b> of two of the children of Eleanor Silliman Belknap Humphrey.Standiford-Mehlingan moved the Standiford Photographic Studio from Louisville to Cleveland, Ohio in 1919, locating first in the Gage Gallery of Fine Arts, then in the Chilcote Building (1925), and subsequently in the Hickox Building at 1030 Euclid Avenue, where she worked into the 1930s. She was awarded prizes for her photographs of Cleveland's elite of the 1920s and 1930s at the Cleveland Museum of Art exhibitions. A collection of her work, including photographic portraits of important citizens of Cleveland, is held by the Western Reserve Historical Society. One of her portraits and a statement about the portrait may be found in The American Annual of Photography.|$|E
5000|$|Stereoscopic Autochromes were {{especially}} popular, the combined color and depth {{proving to be}} a bewitching experience to early 20th Century eyes. Usually of a small size, they were most commonly viewed in a small hand-held box-type stereoscope. Larger, non-stereoscopic plates were most commonly displayed in a <b>diascope,</b> which was a folding case with the Autochrome image and a ground glass diffuser fitted into an opening on one side, and a mirror framed into the other side. The user would place the <b>diascope</b> near a window or other light source so that light passed through the diffuser and the Autochrome, and the resulting back-lit, dark-surrounded image would be viewed in the mirror. Slide projectors, then known as magic lanterns and stereopticons, were a less common but especially effective display technique, more suitable for public exhibitions. Unfortunately, projection required an extremely bright and therefore hot light source (a carbon arc or a 500 watt bulb were typical) and could visibly [...] "fry" [...] the plate if continued for {{more than two or three}} minutes, causing serious damage to the color. More than a few surviving Autochromes suffer from such [...] "tanning" [...] and conventional projection is not a recommended means of displaying these irreplaceable images today.|$|E
50|$|However, on 5 November Jean Restany, {{head of the}} Renault design bureau, {{decided to}} rebuild the {{prototype}} anyway. On 26 January 1937 the rangefinder was received, but it proved, with a width of 160 centimetres, simply too wide for a chassis that itself was no wider than 170 centimetres, though {{an attempt was made}} to place it in a wooden dummy turret. On 2 April a commission of artillery officers visited Renault and these suggested to use the smaller standard rangefinder used by machine-gun units that had a base of 125 centimetres. This was built in a steel cupola, that also featured a central pair of binoculars and binocular <b>diascopes</b> at the sides and back, that could be protected by armoured shutters. On 22 June Renault offered to sell this vehicle for the discount price of ₣ 150,000 (mock-up included). On 31 July the Army agreed; the contract was signed on 7 October 1937.|$|R
50|$|This ST2 turret had a {{very complex}} {{geometry}} with many shot traps. This was partly caused by the large protruding <b>diascopes</b> at the sides, but also a result of forcing the commander to operate in three height levels: he had to stretch himself to observe his surroundings via the cupola, had a forward observation hatch that he could look through while standing in a normal position and had to crouch to operate the 47 mm SA34 gun {{to the right of}} him and the coaxial 7.5 mm machine gun to the left. The lower level had its own extension, where extra room had been found {{in the front of the}} turret to bring the machine gun forward, while retracting the main gun, thus improving balance even further. Needless to say, the army was very critical of this general arrangement, but it could not be rejected as deliveries were already greatly delayed: the first replacement turrets were fitted only in early 1936.|$|R
50|$|It was {{considered}} to rebuild the original production series as flamethrowers and a single prototype had already been modified in this way; on 27 September 1939 a first batch of fifteen had been ordered and on 23 April 1940 {{it was decided to}} modify all vehicles. Nevertheless, there was a parallel plan, irreconcilable with the flame thrower project, to uparm them all. In September 1939 two of the five vehicles used at the central driver school (ECC) were experimentally fitted with the longer gun, leaving three tanks to be employed for training. In the winter of 1940 it became apparent that France would have for the immediate future a lack of really powerfully armed tanks; at that moment the organic strength of SOMUA S35 or Char B1 units was just about three hundred. Adding 49 vehicles — the flamethrower prototype could not be easily turned into a standard tank again — would thus represent a not inconsiderable reinforcement of the battle tank fleet. It was accordingly decided to indeed modify the existing APX 1 turrets of the vehicles into the APX 1A version, a process that had already taken place to bring the original 34 Char B1 tanks up to Char B1 bis standard. The APX 1A retained the original protruding <b>diascopes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Eleanor {{requested}} {{a portrait of}} her young son Edward Cornelius Humphrey and his little sister Alice from the Standiford Studio in Louisville, Kentucky. This portrait, now in a private Humphrey collection, is a rare example of an antique photography process called autochrome which used a reflected mirror view inside a viewer called a <b>diascope.</b> The Autochrome Lumière process is described in Wikipedia's History of photography and Lumiere Brothers. The photographer of the autochrome of the Humphrey children was Ethel Standiford-Mehlingan, an experimental photographer and artist who later moved her Louisville enterprise Standiford Studios to Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E
5000|$|During the {{production}} run several modifications would be made, {{such as the}} fitting of lifting hooks. The first thirty vehicles had two more primitive periscopes on the turret roof, a Chrétien <b>diascope</b> on its front and simple vision slits with armoured shutters on its sides; their drivers too had to use vision slits instead of an episcope. They also lacked a silencer and had semi-circular cut-outs at the wheel plate edges. From about the 111th vehicle (or fourth production batch) onward, several changes were introduced, including the fitting of an armoured ventilator covering {{on top of the}} turret, a factory plate with the name [...] "Panhard" [...] on the nose and a new softer factory camouflage pattern with the brown and bronze green spots no longer separated by black lines. From the 270th vehicle onwards stowage boxes were constructed on the back fenders, obscuring the pointed form of the engine compartment. The last turrets produced also had a backward pointing episcope for the commander, instead of a vision slit.|$|E
50|$|First IVR {{congress}} in Berlin 1910:In May 1910, the first IVR Congress {{was held in}} Berlin at the Preußisches Herrenhaus (Prussian House of Lords). The Congress was attended by about 70 participants and 20 accompanying wives - mostly, but not all, Germans. The academic program, consisting of about 10 lectures, focused on basic questions of the philosophy of Law. Both founding fathers Kohler and Berolzheimer gave programmatic lectures: Kohler gave one on „Aufgaben und Ziele der Rechtsphilosophie“ („Tasks and Aims of Philosophy of Law“) and Berolzheimer on „Der Methodenstreit in der Rechtsphilosophie der Gegenwart“ („Dispute over Method in current Philosophy of Law“). Interestingly, there was a lecture, given by Walter Pollack, which was presented using a <b>diascope</b> ("Lichtbilderdemonstration"). The social program of the first congress was quite modest: a welcoming evening at the Palace Hotel and two afternoon receptions {{at the home of}} Mr. and Mrs. Kohler and Mr. and Mrs. Fürstenberg (the latter having a grand villa in western Berlin, in Grunewald). In 1910 as well, Kohler was dean of the faculty of law, celebrating the jubilee of the University‘s founding. Under the eagis of dean Kohler, American president Roosevelt and the German Emperor were granted Honorary Doctors.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{bacterial}} effects of ErCr:YSGG laser irradiation and its dependence of the working tip angulation. Also the morphologic changes of the lasered areas are valued with scanning electron microscopy. After cleansing and shaping extracted single root human teeth to ISO 40, longitudinal section dentin slices of different thicknesses (0, 1 mm, 0, 15 mm, 0, 3 mm, 0, 5 mm, 1 mm) were sterilized and inoculated with 0, 001 ml of an enterococcus faecalis suspension. The contralateral side of the dentin slices were irradiated under an acute angle of 5 ° using the ErCr:YSGG laser (lambda= 0, 00278 mm) adjusted to 12, 5 mJ at which a control group served unlasered. The bacteria were then removed from the dentin slices using vibration in 1 ml sterile and isotonic NaCl-solution and cultured on Columbia-agar. In spite of the small energy of 12, 5 mJ there was found a significant bacterial reduction till the dentin slice of 0, 5 mm. The dependence of the working tip angulation of 5 degree and 90 degree was examined with sterile <b>diascopes</b> to assume equal conditions. It was proved a significant difference. The scanning electron microscopy examination shows almost clean areas without bacterial debris or smear layer. The openings of the dentinal tubules were clearly visible. The intertubular dentin seemed to be ablate more than the peritubular dentin...|$|R
50|$|In 1932 the Char D1 was {{the most}} — indeed the only — modern tank matériel {{available}} to the French Army. Therefore, {{it was out of}} the question to delegate this type to the role of mere infantry support. It now should function as the Char de Bataille, with the main task of fighting enemy armour, as was shown by the choice for a 47 mm gun and the presence of radio sets. The ten NC31s were used for driver training; the other vehicles were allocated to three battalions, one each in 507, 508 and 510 RCC, the elite tank units. As the threat of war steadily increased, first through Soviet military build-up and then because of Germany's rearmament, the modern equipment was supposed to show to foreign powers that France was still a force to be reckoned with. For the regiments receiving the new tank, it was a grave disappointment however. The main reason for this, besides the fact that the obsolete Renault FT turrets had to be used for the first four years, lay in its very poor mechanical reliability. In March 1934, when 110 vehicles had been delivered, it was reported that seventeen of these were already worn out and had to return to the factory for a complete rebuild; of the remaining 93, 62 were non-operational because of major defects. The burn-through of brakes and transmissions was common; the armour plates were bent out of shape because the chassis was not stiff enough, their rivets regularly snapping. The fundamental cause of this was that the Renault design team tended to solve the problem of how to combine low weight with low cost by applying weak components of inferior steel quality: other Renault designs as the AMR 33, AMC 35 and Char D2 suffered from comparable problems. In 1935 a large maintenance programme was started to improve the Char D1's mechanical reliability; but when in March 1936 the elite units had to hurry to the German border in reaction to the Rhineland Crisis, it became painfully obvious how poor their readiness still was. The new ST2 turret only worsened the situation: the glass of the <b>diascopes</b> was discovered to shatter by mere driving; there was no AP-shot available, except for about twenty tanks equipped with the naval 47 mm gun, fitted because the regular SA34 was in short supply; the munition racks hadn't yet been changed to hold the larger rounds. The SA34 was too weak a gun anyway; but the turret was too small to be adapted to the much more powerful 47 mm SA35. Analysis of the events led the Army to conclude that it should rid itself as soon as possible of the troublesome matériel. Even though some modifications were implemented, such as a changed antenna base that did not obstruct turret rotation, early 1937, when newer types were available, all Char D1s in mainland France were phased out, with the exception of the NC31s.|$|R
50|$|In 1938 the turrets {{also were}} delivered. As there {{was now a}} surplus of fifteen, these were used on fortifications: {{thirteen}} of these on coastal defence pillboxes; another two turrets were installed on pillboxes at Remouchamps where a fortress was initially intended to be built, but {{due to the lack}} of funds only two casemates were constructed. The turrets were equipped by Belgium with a different armament: instead of the French SA 35 gun, a Belgian FRC 47 mm gun was fitted; this closely related type had a barrel that was 15 mm shorter. Also the machine gun was different: an optionally coaxial 7,65mm rechambered Hotchkiss (Maxim) 08/15 MG. The Belgian turrets were produced at Nantes as the APX2 B, which had the <b>diascope</b> on the left side moved to the facet behind, because the drum magazine for the 7.65mm Maxim 08/15 machine gun made it impossible to look through it in the original position. Older sources incorrectly claim that a 13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine gun was fitted. An armour plate was welded over the hole. They were rebuilt at Ghent by the SEM (Société d'Électricité et de Mécanique Van den Kerckhove & Carels) between September 1939 and February 1940.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{contribute}} to the development of a new methodology to address agro-ecosystem information various concepts have been tested in practice in the context of the Experimental Unit <b>Diascope.</b> During this development, rigorous and appropriate terminology was gradually released to enable effective integration of knowledge to manage the complexity of information from agro-ecosystems. This data base is developped as a semantic-conceptual basis to describe any data from agro-ecosystems in the context of a systemic approach. This allows open exchanges across disciplines related to agronomy and environmental sciences, and includes socio-economic concerns with the objective of sustainable agriculture...|$|E
