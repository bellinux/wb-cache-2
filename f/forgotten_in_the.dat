5|$|Different {{estimates}} exist of {{the amounts}} of indium contained within the ores of other metals.

40|$|Thinking {{and remembering}} can cause <b>forgetting.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> context of remembering, {{retrieving}} one item {{can cause the}} forgetting of other items (Anderson, Bjork, & Bjork, 1994). A similar phenomenon has been observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of creative problem solving—attempting to generate a target associate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Remote Associates Test (RAT) can cause the forgetting of inappropriate associates (Storm, Angello, & Bjork, 2011). Experiment 1 examined whether this problem-solving-induced forgetting is cue dependent or cue independent by manipulating the cues used at final test. Whereas some participants were tested on the inappropriate associates using the same cues that were used during problem solving, other participants were tested using new, or independent, cues. Problem-solving-induced <b>forgetting</b> was observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same-cue condition, but not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new-cue condition. Experiment 2 replicated the overall absence of problem-solvinginduced <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new-cue condition and found that individual differences <b>in</b> cue-independent <b>forgetting</b> did not predict problem-solving performance on a separate set of RAT problems.

40|$|When {{people are}} cued to forget a {{previously}} studied {{list of items}} and {{to learn a new}} list instead, such cuing typically leads to forgetting of the first list, and to memory enhancement of <b>the</b> second. <b>In</b> two experiments, we examined such listwise directed <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> children (and adults), using a forget cue that placed either high emphasis or low emphasis on <b>the</b> need to <b>forget.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> low-emphasis condition, (adult-like) List- 1 <b>forgetting</b> was present <b>in</b> fourth graders, but not in first graders (and kindergartners); <b>in</b> contrast, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> highemphasis condition, (adult-like) List- 1 forgetting was present from first grade on. Only fourth graders showed (adult-like) List- 2 enhancement, regardless of task instruction. The finding that first graders showed List- 1 <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-emphasis condition only points to a production deficiency in first graders’ directed forgetting, suggesting that the children are capable of intentional forgetting but fail to do so spontaneously. The finding that first graders showed List- 1 forgetting without List- 2 enhancement suggests that the two directed-forgetting effects are mediated by different processes with different developmental trajectories...|$|R
5|$|Barbauld's {{career as}} a poet ended {{abruptly}} in 1812 {{with the publication of}} Eighteen Hundred and Eleven, which criticised Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars. She was shocked by the vicious reviews it received and published nothing else in her lifetime. Her reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative years.

5|$|Barely {{five years}} after {{upgrades}} were completed in 1888, it was suggested the fort be demolished. Debates over the fort lingered on between the Colonial Defence Committee in London, and the Local Defence Committee in Singapore for nearly a decade. The fort was finally rendered obsolete and abandoned in 1901 when the guns were removed. Instead of destroying the fort, the British thought it simpler to bury it, which was done sometime after World War I. A portion of a bastion was still visible above ground well into the 1960s, when a public park was built atop the fort for the fast-growing Katong suburbs. In the late 1960s, the bastion was finally buried when land reclamation in the East Coast took place, and its memory was soon <b>forgotten</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ensuing decades.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} two {{experiments}} designed {{to examine how}} the similarity of retrieval-practised and not-retrieval-practised items influences the amount of retrieval-induced forgetting. Participants studied categorised item lists with each category consisting of exemplars from two different semantic subcategories. Using both the retrieval practice paradigm (Experiment 1) and the output interference paradigm (Experiment 2) {{we found that the}} retrieval of a subset of the studied items impaired the subsequent recall of the nonpractised items if the two types of items were fairly dissimilar to each other (same category but different subcategory) but did not induce impairment if the two types of items were highly similar (same category and subcategory). These results indicate that a high degree of similarity of practised and nonpractised items can eliminate retrieval-induced forgetting. They also suggest that <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> retrieval practice paradigm and <b>forgetting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> output interference paradigm are mediated by the same mechanisms.

5|$|In 1388 he {{returned}} to Rome, possibly hoping that the accusations against him had been <b>forgotten</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> meanwhile. He was arrested, tried and imprisoned, but was released after Urban VI's death in October 1389 and the general amnesty granted by the new pope, Boniface IX. Leaving Rome, Paul went {{to the court of}} Amadeus VII of Savoy. There he presented himself as a distant relative to the Count—a claim likely relying on his tenuous links to the Palaiologoi, who in turn were remotely linked to the House of Savoy via Empress Anna of Savoy, Amadeus VII's great-aunt—and as a victim of papal persecution on account of his support for the Avignon papacy. Paul's claims of kinship were dubious, but Amadeus was moved by the plight of a fellow Avignon supporter, and accepted him as the legitimate Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. He provided Paul with money and an escort of twelve horses and twelve servants, and sent him on to the papal court of Avignon.|$|E

Later she became disillusioned with the new tile manufacturer and, with her time and money increasingly occupied by the running of the Watts Gallery, she lost interest in the project, and only five further tablets were added during her lifetime.|$|E

5|$|Old-style serif typefaces by Garamond and {{his colleagues}} finally fell out of use {{altogether}} {{with the arrival of}} what is now called the Didone style of printing in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, promoted by the Didot family in France and others. This favoured a much more geometric, constructed style of letter which could show off the increasingly refined paper and printing technologies of the period. Mosley comments: The upheavals of the Revolution coincided with the major shift in the style of printing types that is associated with the family of Didot, and the stock of old materials abruptly lost its value, except as scrap. Punches rust, and the copper of matrices is recyclable.

5|$|Some {{interest}} in Forster's life and revolutionary actions was revived {{in the context}} of the liberal sentiments leading up to the 1848 revolution. But he was largely <b>forgotten</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Germany of Wilhelm II and more so in the Third Reich, where {{interest in}} Forster was limited to his stance on Poland from his private letters. Interest in Forster resumed in the 1960s in East Germany, where he was interpreted as a champion of class struggle. The GDR research station in Antarctica that was opened on October 25, 1987, was named after him. In West Germany, the search for democratic traditions in German history also lead to a more diversified picture of him in the 1970s. The Alexander von Humboldt foundation named a scholarship program for foreign scholars from developing countries after him. His reputation as one of the first and most outstanding German ethnologists is indisputable, and his works are seen as crucial in the development of ethnology in Germany into a separate branch of science.|$|E
5|$|The Bengalee, a reformist newspaper, {{presents}} a rare {{view of the}} true victim Elokeshi being <b>forgotten</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> debate of the trial and sympathy towards Nobin.

In one play, Elokeshi's character is debated by village wives and prostitutes. The wives vilify Elokeshi as an unchaste woman, question her devotion for Nobin and express the belief that a woman cannot be raped without her consent. The prostitutes empathise with Elokeshi, another victim of male lust and lament her fall from grace, which for them illustrates the brittle status of a wife. Some plays depict Elokeshi as having no choice but to surrender to the mahants lust on her father's command. Such plays concentrate more on scenes where Elokeshi gives in to her father's orders than on the depiction of rape.|$|E
