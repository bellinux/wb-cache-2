5|$|Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman co-produced {{most of the}} Eon films until 1975, when Broccoli {{became the}} sole producer. The single {{exception}} during this period was Thunderball, on which Broccoli and Saltzman became executive producers while Kevin McClory produced. From 1984 Broccoli was joined by his stepson Michael G. Wilson as producer and in 1995 Broccoli stepped aside from Eon {{and was replaced by}} his daughter Barbara, who has co-produced with Wilson since. Broccoli's (and until 1975, Saltzman's) <b>family</b> <b>company,</b> Danjaq, has held ownership of the series through Eon, and maintained co-ownership with United Artists since the mid-1970s. The Eon series has seen continuity both in the main actors and in the production crews, with directors, writers, composers, production designers, and others employed through a number of films.|$|E
5|$|Mauricio González-Gordon y Díez, Marquis of Bonanza (18 October 1923 – 27 September 2013) was a Spanish sherry {{maker and}} a conservationist. Most {{of his life}} he worked for the <b>family</b> <b>company,</b> González Byass, where he {{increased}} its exports to a worldwide level. His family estate was located in the wetland region called Doñana in southern Spain and was threatened by drainage efforts in the early 1950s. González-Gordon with the help of researchers and international support managed to preserve the site, {{while at the same time}} donating some of his family land to the conservation effort. Afterward, González-Gordon became one of the founders of the Spanish Ornithological Society in 1954. His conservation efforts for Doñana culminated in the creation of the Doñana National Park in 1969. The area was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994.|$|E
40|$|Many {{overseas}} studies {{discussed the}} topic of corporate governance and performance in <b>family</b> <b>companies,</b> however, {{few studies have been}} conducted in Malaysia. The objective {{of this paper is to}} examine the board mechanisms and <b>family</b> <b>companies</b> performance using three performance indicators (Tobin's Q, Earnings Per Share & Operating Cash Flow). The sample size is 189 <b>family</b> <b>companies</b> listed on Bursa Malaysia from 2003 to 2007. The findings from this study reveal that some of the board mechanisms influence family companies' performance. This study evidenced that <b>family</b> <b>companies</b> with a large board size, low directors' expertise and duality leadership contribute to higher family companies' performance. However, this study found that the academic qualification of directors does not influence firm performance. Therefore, generally, regulators and investors need to be sensitive to the fact that <b>family</b> <b>companies</b> do have differences in corporate governance practices compared to non-family companies...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{whether and how}} family ownership enhances or damages firm value using a sample of Canadian companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) 1999 to 2007. We identify <b>family</b> <b>companies</b> as firms in which the founder or founding family hold more than 20 percent of outstanding shares and are the largest shareholders, or firms in which family members work as CEOs and/or serve as Chairman {{of the board of}} directors. In addition, we construct a sample of matching firms which are in the same industry, have a similar size as the <b>family</b> <b>companies,</b> and whose sales range within +/- 25 percent of the sales of <b>family</b> <b>companies.</b> We use Tobin's Q and return on asset (ROA), measured by either net income or EBITDA divided by total assets, as proxies of firm value. Our results suggest that <b>family</b> <b>companies</b> are generally superior to non-family companies. In addition, we find that control-enhancing mechanisms which are often employed by <b>family</b> <b>companies</b> add values to companies. Furthermore, we find that agency conflicts between ownership and management are more costly than those between majority and minority shareholders, suggesting that family ownership helps resolve the agency conflicts between ownership and management and in turn enhances firm value. Finally, we find that <b>family</b> <b>companies</b> with founders as CEOs outperform those with descendants as CEOs...|$|R

5|$|Poulenc's wealthy family {{intended}} him for {{a business}} career in the Rhone Poulenc <b>family</b> <b>company</b> and did not allow him to enrol at a music college. Largely self-educated musically, he studied with the pianist Ricardo Viñes, who became his mentor after the composer's parents died. Poulenc soon came {{under the influence of}} Erik Satie, under whose tutelage he became {{one of a group of}} young composers known collectively as Les Six. In his early works Poulenc became known for his high spirits and irreverence. During the 1930s a much more serious side to his nature emerged, particularly in the religious music he composed from 1936 onwards, which he alternated with his more light-hearted works.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} {{was built on}} the site of derelict farm buildings. There were different designers for different parts of the service area, with Owen Williams as the coordinating architect. An ornate design for a footbridge by Clough Williams-Ellis was rejected in favour of a more functional and conservative modernist design by Owen Williams. When the services opened the new buildings were incomplete so the food was served from temporary sheds. The original plan had been for trucks to use this service station and for cars to use Newport Pagnell. In practice, however, both service areas were unrestricted. The first owners of the services were Blue Boar Limited, a <b>family</b> <b>company</b> that owned a nearby petrol station on the A5. Although the official name has always been Watford Gap, the services were colloquially called Blue Boar for some time after opening.|$|E

He died on 27 September 2013 in his hometown of Jerez de la Frontera at the age of 89. His family claims that the last thing he drank was a Tío Pepe, the most famous brand of the family business. His death occurred at the Asisa clinic where he had spent his last couple of weeks. The memorial service was held at the San Juan Bautista de La Salle church on 28 September.|$|E

He was the fifth {{generation}} of the family to chair the company.

During this period González-Gordon managed to expand the business by exporting all over the world, including to the United States, United Kingdom, China and East Asia. After his time as president he continued to serve as an advisor to his son, Mauricio Junior, who took over his position. Apart from his work at González Byass González-Gordon also diverted some of his time towards the regulatory council of the sherry making industry, serving for 24 years.|$|E
