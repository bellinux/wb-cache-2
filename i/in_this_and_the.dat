25|$|When {{it became}} known that the western alliance's own {{pressing}} needs would prevent them from supplying the Scandinavian countries with armaments, Norway, wanting access to those arms, decided {{that it would be}} more advantageous {{to be a member of}} NATO and resigned from the talks. Denmark was still willing to enter into an alliance with Sweden, but the Swedes saw few advantages <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> proposal failed. Norway and Denmark subsequently became signatory parties to the North Atlantic Treaty and members of NATO, while Sweden remained neutral.|$|E

2500|$|The {{civil parish}} of Acton {{was on the}} eastern edge of the Forest of Mondrem in the Bronze Age, giving rise to the name Actune, meaning [...] "oak town", for the {{predominant}} pedunculate oaks. A Roman road from Middlewich to Whitchurch passed immediately to the north of the parish, but there is little evidence of settlement. An area north of Acton village was enclosed in the 8th and 9th centuries, and ancient field systems can be discerned elsewhere <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> adjacent modern civil parishes.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{model of}} {{epigenetic}} function is the [...] "trans" [...] model. In this model, {{changes to the}} histone tails act indirectly on the DNA. For example, lysine acetylation may create a binding site for chromatin-modifying enzymes (or transcription machinery as well). This chromatin remodeler can then cause changes {{to the state of}} the chromatin. Indeed, a bromodomain — a protein domain that specifically binds acetyl-lysine — is found in many enzymes that help activate transcription, including the SWI/SNF complex. It may be that acetylation acts <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> previous way to aid in transcriptional activation.|$|E

2500|$|After {{graduating in}} 1872, Sturgis entered the legal profession, {{becoming}} a barrister of the Inner Temple in 1876. During the same four years, he distinguished {{himself as a}} footballer, playing for the amateur team the Wanderers when they won the FA Cup in 1873. [...] As all the other players <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> previous Cup Final were either English, Irish or Scottish, Sturgis was the first American to appear in, let alone play on the winning side of, an F.A. Cup Final. [...] He also played for the Old Etonians, and in the FA Cup Semi-final against Oxford University at The Oval on 19 February 1876, he scored the only goal for the public school old boys {{to take them to}} their second consecutive final, against the Wanderers. [...] He played in the final at The Oval. Sturgis also played for the Gitanos football club and at county level for Middlesex.|$|E
2500|$|In the First Test at Brisbane he took 5/167 {{on a flat}} wicket in Australia's 645 and {{suffered}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> next three Tests as the England captain Wally Hammond set stereotyped defensive fields and was loath to take advice. In the Second Test at Sydney Wright (1/169) “bowled beautifully with the most wretched luck”, in one over [...] "On four occasions Hammond, usually most undemonstrative, threw {{his hands in the}} air as the ball beat Bradman and shaved the stumps, and in between these near dismissals there was a confident appeal for leg before wicket. [...] "He continually rapped the pads with his straight one, and when the decision went against him, his face clouded with puzzled dismay." [...] In the Third Test at Melbourne Bradman tried to hit a straight ball to leg, but missed and was hit {{on the top of his}} pads plumb in front of the stumps. Wright and Evans appealed, but Bradman was given not out. However, a cameraman took a series of photographs of the delivery and [...] "the camera appears to give a different verdict".|$|E
