The biggest inspiration for the episode, however, came from the fact that Davis wished to have an episode wherein he would interact solely with Gillian Anderson. He later noted, [...] "if they're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a scene with Gillian, I'll just have to write one myself."

Oli Welsh of Eurogamer praised the game's puzzles for providing numerous [...] "eureka" [...] moments to the player and considered the title as the video game analog of the Goldberg Variations, but felt that the narrative atop the puzzles was [...] "self-involved and wilfully obscure", and believed {{that it could have been}} omitted, as Blow and his team [...] "needn't have tried to make a puzzle out of art when he had already, so beautifully and so successfully, made art out of puzzles". Justin McElroy of Polygon gave the game an 8/10 rating, describing it as [...] "uplifting but frustrating"; he criticized the length of time involved in solving certain puzzles while expressing concern that less-patient players would take shortcuts.

He wrote him a letter, and Norm responded with [...] "If you're ever in Chicago, drop me a line and we'll give you a tour", so 2 weeks later he booked a flight and got {{a tour of the}} new Bally factory in Bensenville. After lunch Norm offered to drive him back to the airport, but John said [...] "I'm not going back, you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a job". After Norm realized he wasn't joking around, he agreed to hire him. They hired him as a technician in engineering because he had experience troubleshooting games with a Pinball router in Toronto that had about 350 games. One of the designs John had come up with on his own while still in Toronto was Alice in wonderland, which would later become a theme he would revisit.In 1989 he arrived at the new office, Jokerz! was still on test, and his first project was Ice Castle (which never got produced). He shared an office with another designer, and eventually was begged to work on World Cup Soccer 94 because nobody else wanted to tackle that theme. This is the only pinball design that had to be finished by someone else, other than being a family emergency or an accident (see Dennis Nordman's motorcycle accident on Elivra and the party monsters).He would go on to working on four other titles before Williams shut down the pinball division. Theatre of Magic was originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be licensed as David copperfield but they never finalized the license.

60|$|The editor {{passed away}} too, not long after, {{and the thing}} that he had {{inspired}} altogether ceased to be. He was a man of a certain sardonic power, and used it rather fiercely and freely, with a joy probably more apparent than real in the pain it gave. In my last knowledge of him he was much milder than when I first knew him, and I have the feeling that he too came to own before he died that man cannot live by snapping-turtle alone. He was kind to some neglected talents, and befriended them with a vigor and a zeal which he would have been the last to let you call generous. The chief of these was Walt Whitman, who, when the Saturday Press took it up, had as hopeless a cause with the critics {{on either side of the}} ocean as any man could have. It was not till long afterwards that his English admirers began to discover him, and to make his countrymen some noisy reproaches for ignoring him; they were wholly in the dark concerning him when the Saturday Press, which first stood his friend, and the young men whom the Press gathered about it, made him their cult. No doubt he was more valued because he was so offensive in some ways than he would have been if he had been in no way offensive, but it remains a fact that they celebrated him quite as much as was good for them. He was often at Pfaff's with them, and the night of my visit he was the chief fact of my experience. I did not know he was there till I was on my way out, for he did not sit at the table under the pavement, but at the head of one farther into the room. There, as I passed, some friendly fellow stopped me and named me to him, and I remember how he leaned back in his chair, and reached out his great hand to me, as if he were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it <b>me</b> for good and all. He had a fine head, with a cloud of Jovian hair upon it, and a branching beard and mustache, and gentle eyes that looked most kindly into mine, and seemed to wish the liking which I instantly gave him, though we hardly passed a word, and our acquaintance was summed up in that glance and the grasp of his mighty fist upon my hand. I doubt if he had any notion who or what I was beyond the fact that I was a young poet of some sort, but he may possibly have remembered seeing my name printed after some very Heinesque verses in the Press. I did not meet him again for twenty years, and then I had only a moment with him when he was reading the proofs of his poems in Boston. Some years later I saw him for the last time, one day after his lecture on Lincoln, in that city, when he came down from the platform to speak with some handshaking friends who gathered about him. Then and always he <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> the sense of a sweet and true soul, and I felt in him a spiritual dignity which I will not try to reconcile with his printing in the forefront of his book a passage from a private letter of Emerson's, though I believe he would not have seen such a thing as most other men would, or thought ill of it in another. The spiritual purity which I felt in him no less than the dignity is something that I will no more try to reconcile with what denies it in his page; but such things we may well leave to the adjustment of finer balances than we have at hand. I will make sure only of the greatest benignity in the presence of the man. The apostle of the rough, the uncouth, was the gentlest person; his barbaric yawp, translated into the terms of social encounter, was an address of singular quiet, delivered in a voice of winning and endearing friendliness.|$|R
