5000|$|Orogeny is {{the primary}} {{mechanism}} by which mountains are built on continents. The word [...] "orogeny" [...] comes from Ancient Greek ( [...] , [...] "mountain" [...] + [...] for [...] "creation, origin"). Though it was used before him, the term was employed by the American geologist G.K. Gilbert in 1890 to describe the process of mountain building as distinguished from <b>epeirogeny.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In geology, epeirogenic {{movement}} (from Greek epeiros, land, and genesis, birth) is upheavals or depressions of land exhibiting long wavelengths {{and little}} folding apart from broad undulations. The broad central parts of continents are called cratons, and {{are subject to}} <b>epeirogeny.</b> The movement {{may be one of}} subsidence toward, or of uplift from, the centre of the Earth. The movement is caused by a set of forces acting along an Earth radius, such as those contributing to isostasy and faulting in the lithosphere.|$|E
50|$|The {{study of}} {{diastrophism}} encompasses the varying {{responses of the}} crust to tectonic stresses. These responses include linear or torsional horizontal movements (such as continental drift) and vertical subsidence and uplift of the lithosphere (strain) in response to natural stresses on Earth’s surface such as the weight of mountains, lakes, and glaciers. Subsurface conditions also cause subsidence or uplift, known as <b>epeirogeny,</b> over large areas of Earth’s surface without deforming rock strata. Such changes include the thickening of the lithosphere by overthrusting, changes in rock density of the lithosphere caused by metamorphism or thermal expansion and contraction, increases in {{the volume of the}} asthenosphere (part of the upper mantle supporting the lithosphere) caused by hydration of olivine, and orogenic, or mountain-building, movements.|$|E
50|$|With the Pan-African orogeny and {{following}} this orogenic episode, shallow marine sediments formed in Late Vendian. The {{influence of the}} orogenic episode is evident {{at the base of}} the Vendian sediments. Deposition of shallow marine sediments covered large areas in Iran during Paleozoic (e.g., Alborz, East of Iran, Zagros). There is strong stratigraphic evidence that transition from Vendian to Lower Cambrian was a progressive one, without hiatuses; there is no evidence for any orogenic or epeirogenic movements in Iran at this time (e.g., south of Zanjan, Valiabad Chalus, Shahin Dezh). Early Cambrian started with an alternation of shale, phosphate-bearing limestone, and dolomite sitting conformably and transitionally over Vendian dolomites. Transition from Soltanieh Formation to Barut, Zaigoon, and Laloon Formations is very difficult to recognize in the field. Middle Cambrian is characterized by uplift and regression; however, a renewed progression at this time led to the deposition of Mila and Kuhbonan Formations, consisting of limestone, dolomite, and shale, over older units. These formations bear trilobites and brachiopods of Middle and Late Cambrian. In some areas, the Late Cambrian carbonate facies turns transitionally into Ordovician graptolite shales, known as Lashkarak Formation in Alborz, Shirgasht Formation in Central Iran and Ilbeyk and Zardkuh Formations in Zagros. In Kalmard area, Ordovician sediments are sitting on the Vendian sediments through an angular unconformity. In Late Ordovician, most parts of Iran were affected by epeirogenic movements; this coincides with Caledonian orogeny in Europe and some other parts of the earth. The <b>epeirogeny</b> caused a distinct hiatus at the Ordovician-Silurian boundary. Where present, the Silurian rocks in Iran consist mainly of limestone, sandstone, shale and volcanic materials, known as Niur Formation in Central Iran. The Lower Devonian rocks have been reported from several localities in Central Iran (e.g., Tabas, Sourian, Kerman, Zagros); however, they seem to be missing in Alborz and parts of Zagros. Upper Devonian is characterized by marine transgression, particularly in Alborz, that extends into Lower Carboniferous. With exception of Tabas area, no record of Middle Carboniferous marine deposits has yet been discovered in Iran. Upper Carboniferous deposits are not significantly present in Iran and have only been identified in several localities from index goniatites. After a general regression and a distinct hiatus in Upper Carboniferous, Permian marine transgression deposits cover most parts of Iran (e.g., Alborz, Zagros, Central Iran); The Permian sediments are represented by Dorood sandstones, Ruteh and Nesen limestones in Alborz.|$|E

40|$|The marine {{inundation}} of Australia {{during the}} Early Cretaceous, and its subsequent exposure during the generally Late Cretaceous global sea-level high, form {{an example of}} continental <b>epeirogeny.</b> <b>Epeirogeny</b> is relative vertical motion of a continent or part of a continent with respect to other continents when this motion is unaccompanied by folding or faulting. The general features of the Cretaceous history have long been recognized by Australian geologists. Over the years, John Veevers of Macquarie University has published extensively on the Phanerozoic history of Australia, and most recently has placed the Cretaceous vertical motion into context of the plate-tectonic evolution of the region (Veevers et al., 1991). Understanding the cause of <b>epeirogeny</b> has always been difficult, since vertical motion, particularly vertical motion on a regional scale, is not {{a direct consequence of}} plate tectonics. The Mesozoic and Cenozoic vertical motion of Australia is of interest to geodynamics for two reasons. First, the vertical motion is not only simple in its spatial and temporal character, but it is also relatively “easy” (at least in comparison to other regions around the world) to infer quantitatively. Second, the vertical motion occurred not so far back in geologic time, so there is the prospect of relating this motion to plate-tectonic evolution and present day bathymetry, geoid, and lateral mantle structure. The time has now come to reassess the Cretaceous motion in the context of recent advances in mantle dynamics. Broad-scale vertical motions of the Earth's surface can be predicted from geodynamic models - models which can be tested with bathymetry, gravity, and seismology. ...|$|E
40|$|Computational geodynamics {{is leading}} to the {{synthesis}} of plate tectonics and mantle convection into a unified dynamic model. Coupled models of plates and thermal convection quantitatively show both eustatic and epeirogenic controls on long-term uplift and subsidence of Earth's surface from regional to global scales. Eustasy and <b>epeirogeny</b> {{can no longer be}} viewed as mutually exclusive hypotheses explaining continental stratigraphy-both arise with nearly equivalent amplitudes, but with complex phase offsets, by the same system of global convection. Dynamic models assist in the interpretation of the stratigraphic record, which has long been known to show that continents undergo both eustatic and epeirogenic motions...|$|E
40|$|North American Phanerozoic cratonic strata {{comprise}} six transgressive/regressive sequences {{separated by}} interregional unconformities. The mechanism of {{formation of the}} sequences and their bounding unconformities remain uncertain. Although eustasy probably contributed, it cannot have acted alone in their formation, as testified by syn-depositional faulting and post-depositional tilting of strata. We have developed a three-dimensional stratigraphic model which incorporates vertical motions from dynamic topography, background cratonic subsidence, eustasy, denudation, mixed carbonate and elastic deposition, Airy isostasy in response to loading and unloading, and mechanical compaction. The model {{has been used to}} test possible contributions of eustasy, <b>epeirogeny</b> and background subsidence to patterns of cratonic strata. The results demonstrate the potential of dynamic topography to account for observed long-wavelength tilting. They also demonstrate the importance of background subsidence on the craton in providing accommodation space to accumulate and preserve the observed thicknesses of stratigraphic sequences...|$|E
40|$|Oxygen isotopic {{compositions}} {{of upper}} Miocene (9. 2 m. y.) lacustrine limestone from northwestern Wyoming range from - 21. 5 to - 35. 2 % (PDB) {{and are the}} lightest yet reported for a non-marine carbonate sequence. These values require that lake water was greatly depleted in 18 O relative to modern meteoric precipitation and indicate that most inflow was sourced as meltwater from glaciers in the adjacent Gros Ventre range. Assessment of climatic factors influencing the isotopic composition of global meteoric water indicates either that nearly all of Miocene precipitaaion in the southern Rocky Mountains was derived from large lake systems in the Snake River Plain and northern Great Basin to the west, or that Gros Ventre catchment elevations were up to 2300 m higher than at present. Because erosion rates in modern alpine regions suggest that subaerial denudation could only account for up to 1200 m of post-Miocene elevation reduction, any additional lowering must reflect the influence of post-Laramide <b>epeirogeny</b> during Basin and Range extentional tectonism. Lacustrine isotopic data therefore provide boundary conditions on the timing and magnitude of changes in late Cenozoic paleoclimate, topography, hydrology, and tectonism in the western Wyoming portion of the Rocky Mountains...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the putative Pliocene–Quaternary removal of mantle lithosphere {{from beneath the}} southern Sierra Nevada region using a synthesis of subsidence data from the Great Valley, and geomorphic relations across the Sierra Nevada. These findings are {{used to test the}} results and predictions of thermomechanical modeling of the lithosphere removal process that is specific to the Sierra Nevada, as presented in an accompanying paper referenced here as Part I. Our most successful thermomechanical model and the observational data that it explains are further bundled into an integrated physiographic evolution–geodynamic model for the three-dimensional epeirogenic deformation field that has affected mainly the southern Sierra Nevada–San Joaquin Basin region as a result of underlying mantle lithosphere removal. The coupled Sierra Nevada mountain range and Great Valley basin are recognized as a relatively rigid block (Sierra Nevada microplate) moving within the San Andreas–Walker Lane dextral plate juncture system. Our analysis recognizes that the Sierra Nevada possessed kilometer-scale local and regional paleotopographic relief, and that the Great Valley forearc basin possessed comparable structural relief on its principal stratigraphic horizons, both dating back to the end of Cretaceous time. Such ancient paleorelief must be accounted for in considering late Cenozoic components of uplift and subsidence across the microplate. We further recognize that Cenozoic rock and surface uplift must be considered from the perspectives of both local <b>epeirogeny</b> driven by mantle lithosphere removal, and regional far-field–forced <b>epeirogeny</b> driven by plate tectonics and regional upper-mantle buoyancy structure. Stratigraphic relations of Upper Cretaceous and lower Cenozoic marine strata lying on northern and southern Sierra Nevada basement provide evidence for near kilometer-scale rock uplift in the Cenozoic. Such uplift is likely to have possessed positive, and then superposed negative (subsidence) stages of relief generation, rendering net regional rock and surface uplift. Accounting for ancient paleorelief and far-field–driven regional uplift leaves a residual pattern whereby ∼ 1200 m of southeastern Sierra crest rock and similar surface uplift, and ∼ 700 m of spatially and temporally linked tectonic subsidence in the southern Great Valley were required in the late Cenozoic by mantle lithosphere removal. These values are close to the predictions of our modeling, but application of the model results to the observed geology is complicated by spatial and temporal variations in the regional tectonics that probably instigated mantle lithosphere removal, as well as spatial and temporal variations in the observed uplift and subsidence patterns. Considerable focus is given to these spatial-temporal variation patterns, which are interpreted to reflect a complex three-dimensional pattern resulting from the progressive removal of mantle lithosphere from beneath the region, as well as its epeirogenic expressions. The most significant factor is strong evidence that mantle lithosphere removal was first driven by an east-to-west pattern of delamination in late Miocene–Pliocene time, and then rapidly transitioned to a south-to-north pattern of delamination in the Quaternary...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that Cenozoic <b>epeirogeny</b> of the African continent is moderated by convective circulation of the mantle. Nevertheless, the {{spatial and temporal}} evolution of Africa's “basin-and-swell” physiography is not well known. Here we show how continental drainage networks {{can be used to}} place broad constraints on the pattern of uplift through space and time. First, we assemble an inventory of 710 longitudinal river profiles that includes major tributaries of the 10 largest catchments. River profiles have been jointly inverted to determine the pattern of uplift rate as a function of space and time. Our inverse model assumes that shapes of river profiles are controlled by uplift rate history and modulated by erosional processes, which can be calibrated using independent geologic evidence (e. g., marine terraces, volcanism and thermochronologic data). Our results suggest that modern African topography started to develop ∼ 30 Myr ago when volcanic swells appeared in North and East Africa. During the last 15 – 20 Myr, subequatorial Africa was rapidly elevated, culminating in the appearance of three large swells that straddle southern and western coasts. Our results enable patterns of sedimentary flux at major deltas to be predicted and tested. We suggest that the evolution of drainage networks is dominated by rapid upstream advection of signals produced by a changing pattern of regional uplift. An important corollary is that, with careful independent calibration, these networks might act as useful tape recorders of otherwise inaccessible mantle processes. Finally, we note that there are substantial discrepancies between our results and published dynamic topographic predictions...|$|E

It is also a key to understanding long-term landform evolution processes operating over most of the continental surface and their control onto the sediment routing system. We study the surface evolution of West Africa over three erosion periods (~ 45 – 24, ~ 24 – 11 and ~ 11 – 0 Ma) recorded by relicts of three subcontinental-scale lateritic paleolandsurfaces whose age is bracketed by 39 Ar/ 40 Ar dating of lateritic K-Mn oxides. Denudation depths and rates compiled from 380 field stations show that despite heterogeneities confined to early-inherited reliefs, the subregion underwent low and homogeneous denudation (~ 2 – 20 m Ma – 1) over most of its surface whatever the considered time interval. This homogeneity is further documented by a worldwide compilation of cratonic denudation rates, over long-term, intermediate and modern Cenozoic time scales (10 0 – 10 7 yr). These results allow defining a steady state cratonic denudation regime that is weathering-limited, i. e., controlled by the thickness of the (lateritic) regolith available for stripping. Steady state cratonic denudation regimes are enabled by maintained compartmentalization of the base levels between river knick points controlled by relief inheritance. Under such regimes, lowering of base levels and their fossilization are primarily imposed by long-term eustatic sea level fall and climate rather than by <b>epeirogeny.</b> The expression of steady state cratonic denudation regimes in clastic sedimentary fluxes remains to be investigated.

Coeval episodes of sedimentation documented within adjacent Paleozoic to Mesozoic basins of southern Tanzania and the Congo basin of the Democratic Republic of Congo indicate {{that most of the}} cooling in the basement rocks in Tanzania was linked to erosion. Basement samples were from an exploration borehole located within the craton and up to 2200 [*]m below surface. Surface samples were also analyzed. AFT dates range between 317 [*]±[*] 33 [*]Ma and 188 [*]±[*] 44 [*]Ma. Alpha (Ft) -corrected AHe dates are between 433 [*]±[*] 24 [*]Ma and 154 [*]±[*] 20 [*]Ma.

The later exhumation is well detected proximal to the East African Rift (70 [*]Ma). Thermal histories combined with the estimated geothermal gradient of 9 °C/km constrained by the AFT and AHe data from the craton and a mean surface temperature of 20 °C indicate removal of up to 9 [*]±[*] 2 [*]km of overburden since the end of Paleozoic. The correlation of erosion of the craton and sedimentation and subsidence within the Congo basin in the Paleozoic may indicate regional flexural geodynamics of the lithosphere due to lithosphere buckling induced by far-field compressional tectonic processes and thereafter through deep mantle upwelling and <b>epeirogeny</b> tectonic processes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Congo Basin is {{characterized}} by an extensive and relatively thick (ca. 1 km) succession of Jurassic-Cretaceous sedimentary sequences that preserves a unique record of the tectonic and climatic evolution of central Africa during the main period of break-up of Gondwana {{and the emergence of}} the Indian and South Atlantic Oceans. New facies analysis and detailed correlations of these ‘Congo’ sequences are described from field observations in the southwestern Congo Basin and by re-logging cores and well logs from four deep boreholes drilled {{in the center of the}} basin in the 1950 s and 1970 s. The lowermost Upper Jurassic sequence (the Stanleyville Group) records a short marine incursion of the proto-Indian Ocean into the northern Congo Basin, and is in turn overlain to the south by widespread aeolian dune deposits (the Lower Kwango Group), which correlate well with other Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous aeolian sequences in Namibia and eastern Brazil, attesting to a giant ‘Sahara-like’ paleo-desert across central West Gondwana, just before the separation of Africa from South America. U-Pb detrital zircons geochronology from this aeolian sequence in the Congo Basin dates mid-Silurian (ca. 430 Ma), Permian-Triassic (ca. 240 and 290 Ma) and Jurassic (ca. 190 Ma) magmatic zircons, here proposed to have been sourced from abundant volcanic activity along the proto-Andes, in southernmost Gondwana. Two successive middle Cretaceous lacustrine sequences in the center of the Congo Basin (the Loia and Bokungu Groups), first analcime-rich and episodically anoxic, and then more carbonated, are interpreted to record an episode of basin stagnation following the eruption of the Paraná-Etendeka Large Igneous Province and a subsequent hot/humid climate maximum during the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean.

40|$|Geoecodynamics {{integrates}} relevant {{concepts and}} knowledge {{from the earth}} and life sciences into a cross-disciplinary synthesis. Within the encompassing framework of earth. system science, the concepts and methods of (palaeo-) geoecodynamics are obtained from biogeography, geomorphology, genomics,. structural geology, tectonics, geochronology, sedimentology, palaeoecology and evolutionary biology. The analytical strengths of this cross-disciplinary science are enabled by phylogeography and ecology. Positioning the earth and life sciences in a novel association to study life as an earth surface process, geoecodynamics deciphers details of biodiversity dynamics to resolve tenures of landforms. Explorations of the genomic record of earth history forms the epistemic core of geoecodynamics, and quantifying species' tenures in dynamic landscapes hold the keys to unravelling hitherto unobtainable details of landscape evolution. The metaphor of a palimpsest emphasizes that landscapes preserve complex archives of landform dynamics, and that these previously untapped repositories of evolutionary history can now be deciphered. Here, interrogations of the genomic record are structured in a palaeoecological framework to quantify interlinked tenures of species; their archives of DNA variation constitute this evidence for landform dynamics preserved in the palimpsest. The concept of the phylogeographic record defines how a unique envelope of genomic variation can reveal when formative (e. g. tectonic) events shaped the interrelated tenures of a landform and its associated species. It is especially the phylogeographic records of ecological specialists (stenotopic species) that preserve coevolutionary signatures, which, constrained by molecular clocks, reveal where and when formative events modified the palimpsest. We show, by way of an example from the central Kalahari Plateau, that geoecodynamics can quantify, with tight fidelity and a precision as low as 0. 1 kyr, how the tempo and mode of landscape dynamics has interacted with earth's systems, through linking phylogeographic records of mammals and fishes to decipher subtle tectonic events in the Kalahari <b>epeirogeny.</b> Pursuing these insights to their obvious conclusion, geoecodynamics allows deep probing into the solid earth to connect the tempo and mode of landscape evolution with mantle convection...|$|E
40|$|Despite the century-long {{recognition}} of regional <b>epeirogeny</b> along the middle Atlantic passive margin, relatively {{few studies have}} focused on understanding postrift uplift mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that epeirogenic uplift of the central Appalachian Piedmont and subsidence of the Salisbury Embayment represent first-order, flexural isostatic processes driven by continental denudation and offshore deposition. Our results show that regional epeirogenic processes, present on all Atlantic-type passive margins, are best resolved by specific stratigraphic and geomorphic relationships, rather than topography. A simple one-dimensional geodynamic model, constrained by well-dated Baltimore Canyon trough, Coastal Plain, and lower Susquehanna River (piedmont) stratigraphy, simulates flexural deforamtion of the U. S. Atlantic margin. The model represents the passive margin lithosphree as a uniformly thick elastic plate, without horizontal compressive stresses, that deforms flexurally under the stress of strike-averaged, vertically applied line loads. Model results illustrate a complex interaction among margin stratigraphy and geomorphology, the isostatic repsonse to denudational and depositional processes, and the modulating influence of exogenic forces such as eustasy. The current elevation, with respect to modern sea level, of fluvial terraces and correlateive Coastal Plain deposits or unconformities is successfully predicted through the synthesis of paleotopography, eustatic change, and margin flexure. Results suggest that the middle U. S. Atlantic margin landward of East Coast Magnetic Anomaly is underlain by lithoshpere with an average elastic thickness of 40 km (flexural rigidity, D = 4 X 10 (exp 23) N m), the margin experience an average, long-term denudation rate of approximately 10 m/m. y., and the Piedmont has been flexurally upwaped between 35 and 130 meters in the last 15 m. y. Long term isostatic continental uplift resulting rom denudation and basin subsidence resulting rom sediment loading are accomodated primately by a convex-up flexural hinge, physiographically represented by the Fall Zone. Our results elucidate an inherent danger in using topography alone to constrain late-stage passive margin deformation mechanisms. Only through careful synthesis of field stratigraphic and geomorphic elements such as fluvial terraces, Coastal Plain deposits, and offshore stratigraphy can age control be extended from the offshore depositional setting to the erosionally dominated continent. This sudy demonstrates that despite a relatively subdued topography, the middle U. S. Atlantic margin experiences progressive flexural isostatic deformation similar to that proposed for high-relief margins characterized by great escarpments. Thus margin topographic diversity remains a function of other factors, such as lithospheric composition and/or structure, supracrustal stratigraphy and structure, degree of drainage integration, drainage divide migration and climate...|$|E
40|$|Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) is {{a global}} and {{long-term}} process in the Earth, which began 21. 5 millennia ago, according to many ice history modellers. One way to understand the processes of the Earth’s interior, the crustal deformation, and a key correction to estimate the climatological parameters is obtained by studying GIA. Our main objectives are to improve the gravimetric GIA modelling by utilizing some of the satellite geodesy missions leading to the land uplift and geoid rate models and to determine the geoid depression due to GIA. The isostatic rebound of the solid Earth is observable in some regions, e. g. in Fennoscandia, North America and Greenland, using some geodetic techniques, such as GPS. In view of physical geodesy, the mantle mass flow in the GIA process perturbs the observed gravity from a hypothetic isostatic state, which can be measured using satellite gravimetry techniques. We will extract the static and temporal gravity signals due to GIA from satellite gravimetry and present a mathematical relation to determining the solid Earth vertical movement due to GIA leading to gravimetric and combined land uplift rate models. We use an Earth Gravitational Model (EGM) determined {{from a number of}} satellite missions to produce regional geoid models and remove the perturbing effect of the crustal variation and topography from the geoid height resulting in topographic-isostatic geoid models. Then the geoid height signal due to GIA will be extracted using a spectral window and a multiple regression analysis. In North America and Fennoscandia, we find that maximum depressions of  13. 8 and 9. 2 m of the topographic-isostatic geoid model, respectively, are due to GIA. Using some analysing methods, a number of high-resolution regional gravimetric modelling methods have been investigated with respect to their compatibility with the GPS data and the data from the GIA forward models. We determine the GIA signal of the temporal geoid change by exploiting the monthly gravity field from Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission and investigate the capability of three mathematical methods, namely regression, principal component, and independent component analysis (ICA) in extracting the secular trend of the GRACE monthly gravity data. One of the results of this investigation is the success of the ICA method relative to the other methods of gravimetric modelling. Finally, we present a least squares combined Land Uplift rate Model (LUM) by assimilating the data from GPS and the gravimetric model, determined using the ICA method, into the GIA forward model and compare it with a recent GIA forward model, namely ICE- 6 G_C (Peltier et al. 2015). Their discrepancies, for the whole areas subject to <b>epeirogeny</b> in North America and Fennoscandia, vary from - 1. 8 to + 3. 3, and - 0. 45  to + 0. 75 mm/a, respectively, while for the areas near the centre of the uplifting regions these two models are shown to be in a complete agreement.
