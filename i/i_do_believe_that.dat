The group paid $76million to acquire the franchise, and had since named the team Kings XI Punjab. Until 2009, Zinta {{was the only woman}} to own an IPL team, and was the league's youngest owner. She has been involved with launching ticket sales and promoting the team. She said, [...] "My involvement with the team is total. I am extremely passionate about our team and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I am the team's good luck factor, so I want to be there for everything."

[...] Eisenhower's phrasing, [...] "as analyzed for me by the Secretary of State," [...] led Bricker and other conservatives to blame Dulles for misleading Eisenhower, and raised their suspicion that the Secretary of State was a tool of Eastern internationalist interests.|$|E
500|$|Mark Ruffalo {{began his}} role as Banner / Hulk in The Avengers, after Feige said {{he chose not to}} bring back Norton. In October 2014, Norton claimed he chose never to play Hulk again because he [...] "wanted more diversity" [...] with his career, {{and did not want to}} be {{associated}} with only one character. In April 2012, despite Ruffalo being on board to play the Hulk in the sequel, Feige confirmed to Collider that Marvel had no plans at that time to film another Hulk film. In a Q session, Feige and Ruffalo confirmed that discussions are underway to produce another Hulk film due to the positive audience response to Ruffalo's performance in The Avengers. In September 2012, Feige, while exploring all possible story options for a sequel film, including a film based on the [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] and [...] "World War Hulk" [...] storylines, stated, [...] "everything [...] is on the table. Do I think Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in Avengers? <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that.</b> I do believe he absolutely could. We certainly are not even going to attempt that until Avengers 2. So there's a lot of time to think about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Sharp {{criticism}} from Catholic Church authorities put Ferraro {{on the defensive}} during the entire campaign, with abortion opponents frequently protesting her appearances {{with a level of}} fervor not usually encountered by pro-choice Catholic male candidates such as Mario Cuomo and Ted Kennedy. In a 1982 briefing for Congress, Ferraro had written that [...] "the Catholic position on abortion is not monolithic and there can be a range of personal and political responses to the issue." [...] Ferraro was criticized by Cardinal John O'Connor, the Catholic Archbishop of New York, and James Timlin, the Bishop of Scranton, for misrepresenting the Catholic Church's position on abortion. After several days of back-and-forth debate in the public media, Ferraro finally conceded that, [...] "the Catholic Church's position on abortion is monolithic" [...] but {{went on to say that}} [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> there are a lot of Catholics who do not share the view of the Catholic Church". Ferraro was also criticized for saying that Reagan was not a [...] "good Christian" [...] because, she said, his policies hurt the poor. To defend Ferraro, the pro-choice group Catholics for a Free Choice placed an October 7, 1984, full-page ad in The New York Times titled [...] "A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion".|$|E

I do not believe that we are powerless. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> we can with good will and good sense control our destiny.... As a people, we seem to move from extreme to extreme.

2500|$|Likewise, in {{agreement}} with Ottolenghi, the journalist Dan Rickman said that [...] "Shahak ignores [...] aspects of the sources. Further, through overstating his case, his analysis fits into anti-Semitic traditions of such accusations against the Talmud. Copies of the Talmud have been burned, and {{the text of the}} Talmud that is studied today is still heavily censored. Shahak's view that chauvinism in these sources in any way 'justifies' anti-Semitism is also very troubling. However, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> his trenchant critique of Judaism is, tragically, not without some force. The contemporary situation is that we do see some modern Orthodox rabbis utilise xenophobic sources in modern rulings.

2500|$|LSU had 266 {{yards of}} total {{offense in the}} game and Rice {{compiled}} 144.

The performance by LSU impressed the pollsters, who ranked the team fifteenth after being unranked prior to the game. Coach Dietzel said in the locker room after the game:"It was gratifying to score a victory over a team coached by a man that I respect as much as coach Neely. We made mistakes Saturday night [...] we made up for them in hustle and desire.

2500|$|In {{an opinion}} piece, {{once again in}} The Guardian (April 1, 2009), Arundhati Roy made a plea for {{international}} attention to what she called a possible government-sponsored genocide of Tamils in Sri Lanka. She cited reports of camps into which Tamils were being herded as part of what she described as [...] "a brazen, openly racist war". She also mentioned that the [...] "Government of Sri Lanka {{is on the verge}} of committing what could end up being genocide" [...] and described the Sri Lankan IDP camps where Tamil civilians are being held as concentration camps. A Sri Lankan writer called Roy's remarks [...] "ill-informed and hypocritical" [...] and criticized her for [...] "whitewashing the atrocities of the LTTE". Roy has said of such accusations: [...] "I cannot admire those whose vision can only accommodate justice for their own and not for everybody. However <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the LTTE and its fetish for violence was cultured in the crucible of monstrous, racist, injustice that the Sri Lankan government and to a great extent Sinhala society visited on the Tamil people for decades." ...|$|E

Santorum replied, [...] "I'm a conservative. I'm not a libertarian. I believe in some government. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that...</b> as a senator from Pennsylvania that I had a responsibility {{to go out there}} and represent the interests of my state." [...] Moderator Josh McElveen asked Paul if he stood by comments that Gingrich was a [...] "chicken hawk" [...] for not serving in the military. When Paul said that he did, Gingrich said, [...] "Dr. Paul has a long history of saying things that are inaccurate and false. The fact is, I never asked for deferment. I was married with a child. It was never a question." [...] Paul replied, [...] "When I was drafted, I was married and had two kids, and I went", which was greeted with applause.|$|E

In November 2015, Sanders gave a speech at Georgetown University about his view of democratic socialism, including {{its place in the}} policies of presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson. In defining what democratic socialism means to him, Sanders said: [...] "I don't believe government should take over the grocery store down the street or own the means of production, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a decent standard of living and that their incomes should go up, not down. I do believe in private companies that thrive and invest and grow in America, companies that create jobs here, rather than companies that are shutting down in America and increasing their profits by exploiting low-wage labor abroad." [...] Based on Sanders's positions and votes throughout his political career, Noam Chomsky and Thomas Frank have described Sanders as [...] "a New Dealer".|$|E
