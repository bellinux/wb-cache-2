However, only a few micro data studies estimate <b>factor</b> <b>substitution</b> between energy and non-energy factors.

Specifically, building on earlier studies by Azzam and by Holloway, Muth's model is extended to consider the farm-level impacts of generic advertising when downstream firms possess oligopoly and/or oligopsony power and advertising expenditure is endogenous at the market level. Applying the model to the U. S. beef industry, we find that for plausible parameter values market power reduces farmers' incentive to promote. However, the disincentive is moderated by <b>factor</b> <b>substitution,</b> and effectively vanishes as the <b>factor</b> <b>substitution</b> elasticity approaches the retail demand elasticity.
