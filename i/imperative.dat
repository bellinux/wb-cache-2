There is also a subjunctive and an <b>imperative</b> mood, both based on the plain form of the verb (i.e. without the third person singular -s), and which is used in subordinate clauses (e.g. subjunctive: It is important that he run every day; <b>imperative</b> Run!).|$|E

However, the opinion that <b>imperatives</b> are modal is not shared by all researchers. For example, Portner (2007) claims that <b>imperatives</b> are not modal, {{in spite of the}} fact that they share a range of interpretations with modals. In this article I argue that <b>imperatives</b> are in fact modal and that the differences that Portner (2007) identifies are relevant for distinguishing not only between priority modals and <b>imperatives,</b> but between two larger classes of verbal forms, that include priority modals and <b>imperatives,</b> respectively. Crucially, the larger class of verbal forms that includes <b>imperatives</b> and that contrasts with priority modals are undisputedly modal. Thus, differing from priority modals does not necessarily imply lack of modality, but simply a different type of modality...|$|R

Katz argues that the message of the parable is not that the Buddha has been telling lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the <b>imperative</b> use of language. Katz believes that religious language is an <b>imperative</b> and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical <b>imperative,</b> {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical <b>imperative</b> is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical <b>imperative</b> because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical <b>imperative</b> binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical <b>imperative</b> because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E

40|$|Gospel and {{constitutional}} imperatives: {{the right to}} life In the Republic of South Africa, Christians are called to live out gospel <b>imperatives</b> within the legal framework of the Constitution. Ethical issues about {{the right to life}} are considered from the perspectives of selected gospel {{and constitutional}} <b>imperatives.</b> Gospel <b>imperatives</b> impose themselves as a consequence of Christian discipleship. These are many and diverse, both explicit and implicit. Christian vocation, discipleship, witness and perseverance, are foundational and integral to the praxis of Christian daily living. These facets of Christian life are illustrated by the selected gospel <b>imperatives,</b> “Follow me” (Matt. 4 : 19 and synoptic parallels), “Love God, and your neighbour as yourself” (Matt. 22 : 34 - 40 and synoptic parallels), and “Take up your cross” (Matt. 10 : 38 and synoptic parallels). The central theoretical argument of this article is driven from a reformed ethical perspective. Gospel <b>imperatives</b> have priority over constitutional <b>imperatives</b> since gospel <b>imperatives</b> are of divine origin and constitutional <b>imperatives</b> of human origin. Acknowledgement of these priorities informs the Christian ethical perspective on the right to life and on abortion. </em...|$|R

5|$|Kant's Formula of Autonomy {{expresses the}} idea that an agent is obliged to follow the Categorical <b>Imperative</b> because of their {{rational}} will, rather than any outside influence. Kant believed that any moral law motivated {{by the desire to}} fulfill some other interest would deny the Categorical <b>Imperative,</b> leading him to argue that the moral law must only arise from a rational will. This principle requires people to recognize the right of others to act autonomously and means that, as moral laws must be universalisable, what is required of one person is required of all.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} I {{will develop a}} view about the {{semantics}} of <b>imperatives,</b> which I term Modal Noncognitivism, on which <b>imperatives</b> might {{be said to have}} truth conditions (dispositionally, anyway), but on which it does not make sense to see them as expressing propositions (hence does not make sense to ascribe to them truth or falsity). This view stands against “Cognitivist ” accounts of the semantics of imper-atives, on which <b>imperatives</b> are claimed to express propositions, which are then enlisted in explanations of the relevant logico-semantic phenomena. It also stands against the major competitors to Cognitivist accounts—all of which are non-truth-conditional and, as a result, fail to provide satisfying explanations of the fundamental semantic characteristics of <b>imperatives</b> (or so I argue). The view of <b>imperatives</b> I defend here improves on various treatments of <b>imperatives</b> on the market in giving an empirically and theoretically adequate account of their semantics and logic. It yields explanations {{of a wide range of}} semantic and logical phenomena about imperatives— explanations that are, I argue, at least as satisfying as the sorts of explanations of semantic and logical phenomena familiar from truth-conditional semantics. But it accomplishes this while defending the notion—which is, I argue, substantially correct—that <b>imperatives</b> could not have propositions, or truth conditions, as their meanings. This work has benefited greatly from the input of others. I would like to thank Andrew Alwood...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to account for the {{particular}} shape of some Romance <b>imperatives.</b> It has long been recognized that <b>imperatives</b> often equal the bare stem and their morphological make-up reflects their primitive status in language acquisition. It will be shown that in Romance some <b>imperatives</b> can even go farther in phonetic reduction: the verb stem can be radically amputated and the possible reasons for such a drastic reduction will be discussed. It will be argued that phonological submini-mality arises even in those languages in which minimal size restrictions have been taken to be at work. The question of frequency will be addressed, and the view will be held that subminimality produces phonologically marked structures which cannot be accounted for by resorting to frequency effects: though frequency appears to be relevant, it will be argued that monosyllabic <b>imperatives</b> are structurally marked and that markedness stems from the speech-rooted nature of <b>imperatives...</b>|$|R
5|$|Greenlandic verbs inflect for {{agreement}} with agent and patient, for mood and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four {{are used in}} independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: indicative, interrogative, <b>imperative,</b> optative. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take transitive, intransitive or negative inflections, so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms. The inflectional system is further {{complicated by the fact}} that transitive suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single morpheme, requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient for each of the eight transitive paradigms. As some moods do not have forms for all persons (<b>imperative</b> only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318.|$|E

40|$|Research {{on third}} sector media and {{cultural}} organisations {{has tended to}} focus on socio-political <b>imperatives</b> in organisational and production processes. However, my research shows that as socio-political circumstances have gradually changed, other <b>imperatives</b> especially of a professional, artistic and commercial nature now play an equally important role in these processes in the third sector. The interplay between the different <b>imperatives</b> can be conflicting, pulling producers in different directions. Moreover, producers can be subjected to systemic pressures such as demands from subsidy, other funders, broadcasters and politics, all of which impact third sector media and cultural work. Producers respond in ways that have not been sufficiently studied. This thesis aims to address this gap. Drawing on relevant theoretical perspectives and qualitative research methods, I address three key issues in this thesis. First, I examine the ways in which producers in the third sector respond to professional, artistic and commercial <b>imperatives</b> alongside socio-political ones in the organisation and production of news, documentary film and arts and cultural programmes. Where the interplay between these <b>imperatives</b> is conflicting, I analyse how producers negotiate between them. Second, I analyse the response of producers to systemic pressures. Third, I evaluate how producers perceive their work following competing <b>imperatives</b> and systemic pressures. I argue that the evolving environment in which third sector media and cultural organisations operate in some cases compels producers to prioritise commercial and professional <b>imperatives</b> over socio-political and artistic ones and to give in to systemic pressures. Based on British and German case study companies, my thesis provides crucial insights into the interplay between such pressures and competing <b>imperatives</b> in contemporary third sector media and cultural organisation and production...|$|R
