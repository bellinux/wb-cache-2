50|$|Loon op Zand is {{the oldest}} village of the municipality. Somewhere around the year 1000, this village was founded in a very wet and swampy area. There was {{also a lot of}} drift-sand whose origin, {{according}} to geological experts, dates back to the last ice age. As of this moment, Loon op Zand has the biggest <b>driftsand</b> area in all of western Europe. The presence of this <b>driftsand</b> explains the name of Loon op Zand. It means Village build on sand. Historically, the presence of this <b>driftsand</b> has caused the relocation of the village on several times. Hinerland farmers build many sandy embankments or levies to protect their land against the ceaseless drifting sand.|$|E
50|$|In 1877, Lister {{turned his}} {{attention}} to <b>driftsand</b> reclamation at Bellville near Cape Town, where sand was threatening both the road and railway line to the north. He arranged for the town refuse to be spread over the dunes and then planted Acacia cyclops and Acacia cyanophylla between - this stopped movement of the sand and created a valuable source of fuel. In 1893 he carried out the same reclamation program at Port Elizabeth with complete success. The Port Elizabeth suburb of Listerwood was named in his honour, and a small stone monument, next to Marine Drive in Summerstrand, was built as a memorial. Lister retired in 1913 having rendered 38 years of distinguished service. He was succeeded by the Scottish-born forester Charles Edward Legat.|$|E
40|$|The {{chronology}} of polycyclic <b>driftsand</b> sequences in cultural landscapes has mainly {{been based on}} the combination of radiocarbon (14 C) dating of intercalated organic horizons and pollen analysis. This approach, however, yields indirect age information for the sediment units. Also, as soils are dynamic systems, the pedogenetical interpretation of the 14 C ages is often quite difficult. To improve the results of radiocarbon dating, we applied fractionated 14 C dating, sustained by soil micromorphology and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The results indicate {{the complexity of the}} sources and decomposition processes of SOM, and, consequently, provide information as to why radiocarbon dates are not always reliable for the geo{{chronology of}} <b>driftsand</b> deposits. We then performed an optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating study of the <b>driftsand</b> beds in the sequence. This approach yields direct sedimentation ages, and allows differentiating the instable (sand drifting) period from the stable (soil formation) period in each individual cycle of the sequence. Post-depositional mixing of the sands, however, may upset the reliability of the OSL chronology...|$|E
40|$|The Working for Water Programme {{entails the}} removal of water-consuming alien {{vegetation}} and the restoration of low water-consuming indigenous vegetation. It was implemented in 1995 to address the management of catchment areas in South Africa. The question of this programme’s economic feasibility in the Western Cape and in KwaZulu-Natal has been addressed by various authors. This paper addresses its feasibility in the Eastern Cape Province and regions of the southern Cape. Cost-benefit analyses are carried out on six sites: Tsitsikamma, Kouga, Port Elizabeth <b>Driftsands,</b> Albany, Kat River and Pott River. It is shown that catchment management on all the sites {{carried out by the}} Working for Water Programme is inefficient. This conclusion is subject to three qualifications. The first is that more work remains to be done on the evaluation of the non-water benefits. Known non-water benefits, like fire damage reduction and preservation of biodiversity {{were not included in the}} calculations. The second qualification is that at lower discount rates, for instance 5 %, the Kouga project is efficient. The third qualification is that if 30 % cost savings could be achieved and a discount rate of 5 % be employed, both the projects on the Kouga and Tsitsikamma sites will become efficient. These two projects are being run in catchments which serve areas where high consumptive demand exists...|$|R
40|$|Ants in {{roadside}} verges on the Veluwe: {{species richness}} {{and recommendations for}} management (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) Highway verges in the Veluwe region contain some well developed nutrient poor plant communities, like grasslands, grey hair grass vegetation and heather vegetation. These places provide a good habitat for ants. The past five years, we made an inventory of the ants in these road verges. We found 35 species, {{which is more than}} 50 % of the Dutch ant fauna and approximately 80 % of the species known from the Veluwe. Among these were iucn red list species (Anergates atratulus, Myrmica hirsuta, Formicoxenus nitidulus, Formica pratensis, F. rufa/ polyctena), species protected by Dutch law (F. pratensis, F. rufa/polyctena, F. truncorum), nationally rare species (Strongylognathus testaceus, Myrmica schenckioides), and species rare in the region (Lasius mixtus, L. sabularum, Ponera coarctata). In this paper, we present the localities where each species has been found. In addition, we provide recommendations on how to manage the road verges in an ant friendly manner. The nutrient poor zone in the road verges should be maximalized with mosaics of low vegetations. This should be done by fine scale and phased management. If large scale management is necessary, like the removal of most vegetation or the top soil, vegetation refugia should be left intact, from which ants can spread again. The habitat around red wood ant nests should always be left intact. By creating connections with low vegetation between heathlands and <b>driftsands</b> and the verges, the verges will function best as extensions of existing habitats and they may act as corridors between different nature reserves...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to re-examine the flint {{material}} from a Dutch site named Tienray op den Hees (North-Limburg, The Netherlands). The site should {{be placed in the}} occupation history of Northwest-Europe after the Last Glacial Maximum. The re-colonization of Northwest-Europe is closely related to large ecological and climatic changes. The flint assemblage has been examined by Stapert and characterized as Creswellian. An elaborate study on the typo- and technological aspects of flint show that the Tienray assemblage should not be assigned to the Creswellian. On typological grounds, the Laterally Modified Laminar Pieces and technological aspects point into the direction of Federmesser technology. The absence of the en éperon preparation, the low amount of 'lips' and the external platform angles are indications for the use of soft stone percussion for the production of relative straight blade(let) s and blade like flakes. Based on the current geological data, {{it is not possible to}} date Tienray op den Hees. However, Tienray op den Hees is located between the Late Pleniglacial terrace level 1 and the younger Holocene <b>driftsands.</b> The large variety of tools suggests that all kinds of daily activitities (e. g. processing of skin and meat) took place at the site. A few LMP show macroscopic impact-traces that can only be the end product by the use of arrow point. Retooling might have took place at the site. None of the so called southern 'Creswellian' sites meet the definition argued by Barton et al. (2003). Unfortunately, sites such as Zeijen and Siegerswoude in the Northern Netherlands are not studied on the technological aspects yet...|$|R

Carex trinervis occurs here mainly in an area of fairly high <b>driftsand</b> where Pinus sylvestris grows naturally or was planted. The species is also found under other non-indigenous coniferous plantings of Pinus nigra nigra, Pinus nigra laricio, Picea abies, and Larix leptolepis, as well as under the local deciduous trees Quercus robur and Betula pubescens. Formerly the species grew here in a rather open <b>driftsand</b> area. Most of the planted coniferous forests date from after 1900.

40|$|Historical {{land use}} systems as {{shifting}} cultivation and plaggen agriculture on nutrient poor sandy soils caused serious {{degradation of soil}} and vegetation, resulting in Late Holocene sand drifting. Locally the coversand landscape {{was transformed into a}} <b>driftsand</b> landscape. On sheltered deposition sites polycyclic <b>driftsand</b> profiles developed. They are valuable geo-ecological records of alternating instable (sand drifting) and stable (soil formation) phases in landscape development. Previous research has been done on the reconstruction of the landscape genesis, based on pollen analysis and radiocarbon dating of polycyclic <b>driftsand</b> deposits. Recently, the application of Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating improved the geochronology. The principles of pollen transport and deposition does not allow to select the plant species from pollen spectra, responsible for the on-site production of soil organic matter during soil formation in stable periods. A possible proxy for this, that could add information, is the application of straight-chain lipids analysis. In this pilot study we introduced the biomarker method to separate local and regional species, found in pollen spectra. Different species often have their own specific patterns of alcohols and alkanes of different carbon chainlengths. Therefore, comparing the straight-chain lipid patterns of both (expected) vegetation species and selected soil samples is a means to assess the landscape history. In order to do this the recently developed VERHIB model was used in combination with a cluster analysis. The results obtained from VERHIB and the cluster analysis suggest a dynamic sequence of dominant vegetation species, which in majority support the existing theories about the landscape history of polycyclic deposits in the Netherlands. Some results (e. g. the distribution of Pinus throughout the profile) are much harder to link to earlier research and are likely to be incorrect. Although a couple of problems arose during the analytical process, the application of straight-chain lipids is found to be certainly a very promising technique. Nevertheless, a lot more research has to be carried out to draw more solid conclusions on the strength of the biomarker technique in sandy environments {{and its impact on the}} ideas about the cultural-ecological history of polycyclic soils in the Netherlands.

40|$|Darwin's {{theory of}} natural {{selection}} defines a conscious process of self organisation in which traits become more or less common {{in such a way}} that an organism is able to survive and flourish in a particular environment. Rapid growth in the last fifty years made possible by more and more efficient ways of harvesting resource has created rapid environmental change. Intricately balanced ecologies that have taken millions of years to evolve are suffering from unravelling diversity. It is essential that ballooning populations around the world develop systems in which individual settlements positively affect surrounding ecologies. The effect of sick ecologies and drained resources are most harshly felt by the poor in developing countries. The situation boils down to provision of an element which firstly provides the vital requirements for survival while positively affecting the ecologies of which it is a part; secondly allows settlements to adapt over time according to the traits of users in an environment rather than those of a hierarchical disconnected third party and thirdly insures that survival does not depend on having lots of children. The seed pod aims to grow a localized ecology which allows urbanisation for the poor in developing countries to follow self organizing settlement patterns. Goals: Healthy living becomes possible in the local ecology without employment (unemployment is a reality) Financial resources are freed up for facilities such as schools Social support networks strengthen Minimization of strain on resources allows diversity to flourish Construction of instant communities is replaced by a robust self organizing process of development with the capacity to adapt to rapidly changing conditions The seeds are sown and the settlement grows organically from each unique social and ecological environment Empowerment, self reliance and local skills are generated A community lease and a community-managed register of rights holders with the potential for upgrade to individual ownership provides people the opportunity for long term investment in a great living environment. Resolution at a micro scale is likely to result in more conflict then provision of large scale identically defined units. If systems are put in place to help resolve conflict, however, the process would be tangibly more democratic. The seed pod goes hand in hand with a system for conflict resolution illustrated by the phased growth of Green Park an informal settlement in <b>Driftsands</b> Nature Reserve and by notionally suggesting the integration of the education system into the community through a transition of safe, contained learning spaces and permeable public spaces...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the discourses of nature conservation in South Africa and <b>Driftsands</b> provincial nature reserve from constructionist and environmental justice perspectives. At the outset I examine the theoretical framework on the social construction of nature and that of environmental justice. I then discuss the history of nature conservation in South Africa. Finally I analyse the discourse (nature conservation and local communities) surrounding the <b>Driftsands</b> Provincial Nature Reserve (DNR). This nature reserve is located one kilometre east of Cape Town International Airport, in the Western Cape, South Africa. My analysis of the first theoretical framework (the social construction of nature) confirms that a) the idea of nature is constructed over time; b) nature, as a concept and a phenomenon, is complex; c) nature discourses reveal, hide, and create 'truths' about nature which are accepted as being truthful yet are a question of social struggle and power politics; d) humans have amassed countless definitions of the word 'nature'. Those definitions are categorised by Castree and Braun (2001) into three groups: external, intrinsic, and universal. My analysis of the second theoretical framework (environmental justice) suggests that the idea of nature can be used constructively or negatively depending on who uses it and why. The link between both theoretical frameworks suggests that nature is bound up with agendas. Humans construct natures to pursue individual, social or political agendas. From this standpoint the focus of the thesis shifts from debating whether or not nature is socially constructed to examining what type of agendas were pursued to achieve those 'natural' constructions, and what their consequences were for local communities living in and around protected areas. In order to achieve this, I employed four interlinked analytical methods (stakeholder, discourse, critical and ideological analysis). My analysis of the case study of DNR and that of the history of nature conservation in South Africa suggests ideological similarities. First, in both cases nature conservation is inspired by external environmental views. In the colonial period of South Africa, nature conservation policies and practices were shaped by English and Afrikaner protectionist ideas and aimed also to address the demand of their naturalists, sportsmen, and explorers for hunting and exploiting wild animals. In post-apartheid South Africa, nature has been 12 constructed in protected areas according to universalised environmental views and to some extent has been proactive, meaning that it aimed to address some of the social challenges. Likewise, at DNR, nature conservation was adopted in the early 1980 s by the white government to pursue political agendas. In the late 1980 s nature conservation began to be influenced by universalised environmental views. Second, the ideological nexus of both discourses regarding nature and local communities suggests conformity with global environmental models. Under these models the normal course is: a) to fence local communities from protected areas or to fence protected areas from local communities, b) to maximise the boundaries of protected areas, or to minimise the settlements of local communities in protected areas, c) to regulate local communities' access to protected areas and natural resources, d) to promote persuasive concepts of ecotourism to achieve nature conservation goals through community participation, co-benefiting local communities from protected areas, co-managing protected areas with local communities, and local socio-economic development, e) to aim for the removal of the on-site communities from protected areas. The impoverishment of the DNR on-site communities has been effected by means of three ideological principles. Since 1990, DNR's on-site communities have been labouring under a state of emergency - the state of living below the flood line; the state of high level of house robbery and a worrying level of rape and child abuse. Their dispossession has led to the spaces of temporality - a state of informality and limited public services and hopelessness (there is no hope of sustaining settlements on the site). Currently, these communities are cornered between two choices. Either they voluntarily relocate their shacks into the surrounding townships or they live with the state of emergency, hopelessness and temporality. Local communities of other protected areas in South Africa have been similarly impoverished by these states of emergency, temporality and hopelessness. During the colonial period, South Africa's conservation discourses were predominantly white-based. Whites constructed the common sense among themselves that they own the land and wildlife. Constructing the idea that they are the people of the land meant also suppressing the non-white sovereignty over land and natural resources. For example, Until late in the twentieth century [South African children's literature in English] 13 usually endorsed the assumption held by whites that they had exclusive ownership of the land and wildlife' (Jenkins, 2004 : 107). While whites were protecting South Africa's wildlife, they also alienated blacks from nature. It is just recently, after 1994 that, 'English-Language children's writers and translators of indigenous folktales for children have begun to explore traditional beliefs about and practices in conservation (Jenkins, 2004 : 107). These statements do not state or imply that English literature on humannature discourse begun to explore the idea of harmony where indigenous people live and depend on wildlife. In South Africa, it is typical for non-white communities living in or around protected areas to be relocated voluntarily or by force from their land or their settlements, and to be denied resources they had traditionally used within protected areas. Finally, both contemporary discourses continue to be in line with various universalised conservation models. Although both discourses have evolved over time, the status quo of local communities has remained the same: impoverished by exclusion from protected areas, permitted participation in only insignificant co-management models and recipients of intangible benefits. Although the contemporary discourse on nature conservation appears to be more considerate of local communities, I suggest that it is early days for this young discourse to achieve harmony between people and nature. It is up to local and national governmental and non-governmental agencies to modify global environmental views rather than fully adopting them, in order to be more respectful and accommodating of local communities...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} focused on the first {{appearance}} of farming practicing in North-Western Europe. Hitherto it has been generally accepted that the Neolithic agricultural revolution started around 6 ka BP. Reports of the development of heathland two millennia earlier however, give us reason to believe agriculture was present long before 6 ka BP (Doorenbosch, 2013; Trondman et al., 2015; Sevink et al., 2013). To find out whether this is true, 33 possible pingos were drilled throughout Drenthe and Friesland, in the area surrounding the Aekingerzand. Of these 29 were found to be too sandy to drill through. Of the remaining 4 only 2 were acceptable, the Groote Veen and the Blauwe Gat, a partially excavated peat bog and an excavated lake respectively. Furthermore a sediment sample from the Aekingerzand was taken, containing a peat bog covered by <b>driftsand.</b> Two sites in South Jutland, Denmark were also drilled. A partially excavated lake near Rødding and an untouched peat bog near Padborg. The resulting records were then taken to the lab and analyzed for their lithology, pollen composition and LOI (Loss On Ignition) curve. It was found that the Groote Veen record was disturbed and that the Mikkelborg site (near Rødding) did not contain any interesting signs of <b>driftsand</b> activity. The relevant cores taken from the Blauwe Gat were found to be slightly younger than the core taken at the Padborg site from their pollen assemblage. The pollen assemblage for the Padborg site showed a decrease in arboreal pollen together with a rise in upland herbs and no significant increase in heathland for about 5 ka BP. As this coincided with decreases in the LOI it was concluded that farmers of the Funnel Beaker culture might have had an establishment near the site back then, but only {{for a short period of}} time. The pollen diagram does show a fine example of ecosystem succession after disturbance. The Blauwe Gat showed a decrease in arboreal pollen as well, starting from about 9 ka BP. This decrease however did coincide with a big increase in heathland vegetation, although the LOI did not decrease by a large amount. Therefore it was concluded that early farming must have taken place from 9 - 7 ka BP, with small fields for agriculture, resulting in minimal <b>driftsand</b> activity and heathland formation, and a large amount of heathland maintained by livestock grazing. The findings of the Blauwe Gat record are not corroborated by archeological evidence, as the consensus is that the LBK (Linear Band Keramik) culture was the earliest agricultural active culture in the Netherlands, introducing agriculture and animal husbandry in Limburg at about 7 ka BP. The earliest signs of agriculture in Drenthe stem from the TRB (Trechterbeker) culture at about 5. 8 ka BP. This leaves a gap of about 3000 years of unexplained farming activity in Drenthe, inferred from the vegetation patterns, which requires follow-up research...|$|E
40|$|Polycyclic <b>driftsand</b> {{sequences}} are {{records of}} alternating unstable periods with aeolian erosion and deposition and stable periods with soil formation. In numerous studies, pollen analysis, radiocarbon dating, and {{optically stimulated luminescence}} dating have been applied to collect palyno-ecological information and to establish a robust geochronology for {{the reconstruction of the}} profile genesis. A correct reconstruction of the local vegetation during stable periods in the profile evolution cannot be based on pollen spectra alone, because of the impossibility to separate pollen species produced in-situ and at distance. We considered biomarker analysis as a possibility to solve this problem. In a selected sequence with a well-established geochronology, we applied pollen and biomarker analysis on samples of humic Ah horizons of buried (initial) podzols. Based on species matching in soil pollen spectra and biomarker patterns of samples of (buried) humic horizons, it was possible to distinguish pollen species produced in-situ and at distance from the study site, and consequently to determine the plant species composing the vegetation during stable periods with soil formation...|$|E
40|$|Pollen analysis, soil {{micromorphology}} and {{radiocarbon dating}} {{have been the}} main scientific tools to unlock palaeoecological information from palaeosols during the past decades. In recent years, the application of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating on polycyclic <b>driftsand</b> profiles and plaggic deposits {{has been shown to}} be of great added value to understand the geochronology of the evolution of soils and landforms on sandy substrates. In this paper we present the reconstruction of the evolution of cultural soils and landforms in the study area Maashorst (southern Netherlands), which is part of an extensive region in Northwestern Europe underlain by predominantly Late Glacial aeolian coversand deposits. Deforestation and soils acidification, related to human land use, started before 1750 BC. Based on radiocarbon dating, sedentary agriculture started already around 1000 BC, but OSL dates indicate that the accumulation of plaggic deposits did not start before the Late Middle Ages. The reconstructed evolution of cultural soils and landforms is based on information of scattered palaeosols, interpolated and extrapolated to a sequence of (palaeo) soil maps. Palaeopedological information is not included in regular soil maps because soil classifications are based on the diagnostic properties of actual soils and normally neglect relicts of preliminary steps in soil development. This is convenient for agricultural applications, but such soil maps are less useful for the presentation of long term soil development or as abiotical base for designs for restoration ecology. The results of this study include interpretive maps produced in a geographical information system of the soil patterns around 1500 AD and 2000 BC, based on the present soil map and the reconstruction of palaeoecological development during the Late Holocene. The time sequence of these historical interpretive soil maps reflects the impact of human land use on soils and landforms...|$|E
