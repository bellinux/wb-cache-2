40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the EU bureaucrats – <b>Eurocrats</b> – and their work. Special {{attention}} {{is placed on the}} Eurocrats’ work in EU Committees, working groups and council meeting. I have followed and observed their work first, through a trainee position at the Commission and second, by following the Swedish delegation to the Employment Committee meetings. The ethnographic study of the <b>Eurocrats</b> brings them to life as people of flesh and blood – beyond the stereotype. It shows that going by the book and forming technocratic EU decisions is not an option for these bureaucratic elites. They have to be flexible in handling their multiple roles and knowing when to play – and when to stop playing – the game. The paper shows that the roles <b>Eurocrats</b> play shift through the process: pendulum between articulating and defending ‘national’ positions and acting {{in the interest of the}} EU swings back and forth. In this way, the Eurocrats’ shifting roles contribute to the process of europeanisation. Sooner or later, playing the game in Brussels forces them to put on the hat of a ‘European’ formulating postnational EU decisions. These Eurocratic practices fashion that which we identify as the EU. We may debate if these EU policy decisions are changing the member states’ policies in any significant sense. Regardless, these <b>Eurocrats</b> are through their practices forming EU decisions that go beyond the nation state in a sense forming, if not to its fullest than at least, an embryo towards a postnational European community...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} main types of <b>Eurocrats.</b> First, Political Appointees, {{such as the}} European Commissioners, the Members of the European parliament. Secondly there are fonctionnaires, these are the {{permanent}} staff which form {{the majority of the}} European institutions. There are two categories of fonctionnaires Assistants and Administrators. Assistants perform a [...] "secretarial" [...] roles while administrators perform more policy or managerial responsibilities. The third category is the contractual agents. Contractual agents do not have an employment contract with the same conditions as the fonctionnaires. Their first job contract is limited in duration, however after several renewals this can be extended permanently. <b>Eurocrats</b> come from all member states of the European Union. EPSO is the main body which selects staff for recruitment to the European Institutions.|$|R
50|$|<b>Eurocrat</b> was {{inspired}} by the work of Members of the European Parliament of the European Economic Community. It attempts to combine various aspects of different European nationalities such that no one has dominance.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>Eurocrat</b> (a {{portmanteau}} of [...] "European" [...] and [...] "bureaucrat") is [...] "a {{staff member}} of the administrative commission of the European Union" [...] or more broadly, any official of the European Union.

50|$|The book {{is set in}} {{the long}} hot summer of 1976 in a {{suburban}} London street and concerns the occupants of two adjacent houses. In one lives Kate Cooper who struggles with her two young children and the domestic chores whilst keeping up appearances for her high-flying husband who works as a <b>eurocrat</b> in Brussels, spending little time at home. In the other lives Sam Green is struggling to write a novel whilst his wife goes out to work running a psychiatric practice and his angst-ridden teenage daughter binge eats in her bedroom. Kate and Sam are drawn together whilst their families are seemingly unaware...|$|E
50|$|The {{show was}} at its height during the 1980s and 1990s with a {{conservative}} Kohl federal government; however, some state governments as well as (though less frequently) <b>Eurocrats</b> became the object of its satirical acts. During that time, several sketches were broadcast that made the show famous, such as Kriegerdenkmal (war memorial), Rhein-Main-Donau-Kanal (Rhine-Main-Danube Canal) or Der Verstrahlte Großvater (the radioactive grandfather). It was also {{the time of the}} most controversies (see below).|$|R
40|$|This conference {{paper offers}} details that {{undermine}} the common assumption that EU policies emanate from enlightened foresight and/or coherent planning. To this end, it explores the relatively recent interest in <b>Eurocrats</b> in violence against women, {{an issue that}} few previously expected the EU to address. This paper suggests that while European Commissioners, judges, activists and others are important political actors, they are hardly fundamental architects (or obstructionists) of sexual equality. This distinction, though modest, recommends that we see a more tenuous relationship between the past and present. In short, {{for all of our}} efforts to comprehend social change, a brief look at the issue of male violence underscores the way in which policy development is a serendipitous process with unintended and often misunderstood consequences...|$|R

5000|$|European - {{originally}} {{referred to}} as “Mandarins” stemming from the Chinese word for government employee. Bureaucracy didn’t catch on in Europe very much due to the many different governments in the region, and constant change and advancement, and relative freedom of the upper class.With the translation of Confucian texts during the Enlightenment, {{the concept of a}} meritocracy reached intellectuals in the West, who saw it {{as an alternative to the}} traditional ancien regime of Europe. Voltaire and François Quesnay wrote favourably of the idea, with Voltaire claiming that the Chinese had [...] "perfected moral science" [...] and Quesnay advocating an economic and political system modeled after that of the Chinese. The implementation of Her Majesty's Civil Service as a systematic, meritocratic civil service bureaucracy, followed the Northcote-Trevelyan Report of 1854 which was influenced by of the ancient Chinese imperial examination. This system was modeled on the imperial examinations system and bureaucracy of China based on the suggestion of Northcote-Trevelyan Report. Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain's consul in Guangzhou, China argued in his Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China, published in 1847, that [...] "the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only," [...] and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution meritocratic. In 1958, though, after the formation of the European Union the job of the Bureaucrat became extremely important to help organize and govern such a large and diverse community. In 1961 the term <b>Eurocrat</b> was coined by Richard Mayne, a journalist at the time. A <b>Eurocrat</b> is a bureaucrat of the European Union.|$|E
40|$|Paper {{proposed}} to Journal of European Integration (evaluation in progress) In {{the case of}} State, Scholars have demontrasted that senior officials' ability to embody general interest {{is the result of}} long-term social processes marked by the concomitant construction of the State and civil servants as a social group. Though the European civil servants' situation is different from that of State civil servants, their ability to maintain their central role and defend the European interest invites us to turn our enquiry to processes that realize them (in the double sens of Berger and Luckman) as a group whose objectivation is both strong and rooted into European institutional “realities”. It is one of the aspects of this process that we would like to analyse by focusing on the unions of European civil servants. By examining the social process of crossed unification between the cause, the interest, and the group led by European civil servants unions, this sociological based approached would like to clarify the relation which unites the <b>eurocrats</b> body with the UE institutions...|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{institutional}} innovations introduced with Lisbon Treaty in the EU common foreign and security policy. The pillar structure of EU was abolished, but main features of intergovernmental decision-making procedures and unanimity would de facto remain. That {{is the main}} structural constrain of a single and bolder European outbreak an international scene. An novelty is the some kind of presidentialization (personalization) of {{the field in the}} new posts of President of European Council and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. New procedures and structures are introduced also in a realm of Common Security and Defense Policy. A special hope of <b>Eurocrats</b> are put on the ongoing process of setting up new European External Action Serves as de facto new diplomatic service of the Union. However, there is the main paradox of the Lisbon arrangement in that it is supposed to confirm integration through foreign policy success at a same time when Europe is divided over a number of domestic as well as foreign policy issues, and all that at a time of the manifold global financial and economic crises...|$|R
40|$|The European Union is {{entering}} a new era with a proposed enlargement from its current fifteen states to twenty-five by 2004. This is both an enormous and ambitious undertaking for the European Union and for the individual acceding states. One of the socio-cultural issues associated with the enlargement is emerging European identity. This paper will examine the need for fostering European identity {{as a way to}} bring stability and viability to the Union, and the various problems associated with the forging of pan-European identity-in addition, and based on various national and cultural identities of the peoples of the European Union. On the other hand, fostering European identity cannot be achieved without citizen comprehension of main unifying characteristics, which help serve as a basis for their new identity. Furthermore, in light of the heightened sense of national sovereignty among several member states, efforts of some <b>Eurocrats</b> to foster this identity may become futile. New accession states may become a proving ground for the identity in the future, if the rise in ethno-nationalism there is countered by an increased level of educational campaigning by the EU and national governments...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{put forward}} {{in this paper}} {{is that we are}} currently observing a remarkable policy shift in the European Community concerning the conceptual basis and instruments for the governance of biopolitics. Biopolitics refers to an emerging policy field which involves the societal conflicts over the application of new genetic and reproductive technologies to humans (biomedicine) as well as the application of these new technologies particularly to agriculture and food production (biotechnology). The changes refer to the basic concept of how to govern the relationship between science and society, experts and lay-people, citizens and <b>Eurocrats.</b> The EC is opening up for incorporating ethical concerns into its research, technology and development policy as well as its regulatory biopolicies; furthermore, there is growing openness for “participatory” forms of biopolicy-making, yet the meaning of participation is limited. The reasons for this development {{are to be found in}} a more general trend in the transformation of European governance on the one hand aiming at involving civil society actors, and, on the other hand, in the characteristics of the policy field. These visions, spread out in the Commission’s White Paper on European Governance and several related policy papers, prove to be challenging for the Union as dynamic and multi-level polity...|$|R
30|$|The Second World War {{was a great}} shock which {{weakened}} the Westphalian political order in Europe (De Wilde, 2016, p. 153); however, it {{did not result in}} a dramatic change from the European nation-state system to a federal European system. The decline of the nation-state oriented political system in Europe due to the WWII brought about {{the emergence of a new}} group of elites (<b>Eurocrats),</b> who had a strong belief that the only way to establish peace in Europe would be through a federal/supranational institutionalization since, according to them, nationalism was the main reason behind the warfare in Europe. Therefore, they hoped that the WWII as a great shock would give them a chance to achieve a ‘paradigm shift’ from the European nation-state system to a federal one. Despite this expectation, the mentioned shock only resulted in the ‘duplication of the paradigms’ but not a ‘paradigm shift’ thanks to the nation-state’s having enough institutional power to survive. Moreover, this ‘paradigm duplication’ resulted in an anomaly in the European integration process. Particularly, the conceptualization of democracy was done according to a federalist intellectual paradigm but its implementation happened in an intergovernmental structure. As a result, the ambition to institutionalize democracy at the EU level according to a federal logic has become one of the main reasons behind the current stalemate in the European integration process.|$|R
40|$|In the European Union {{political}} {{visions of}} a ‘Social Europe’ are being fuelled by the creation of common EU employment and social policy. The aim {{of the study is}} to investigate the workings and dynamics of policy-making in the area of employment, {{as an integral part of}} the fashioning of the European Union. Policies are channels for the cultural flows of ideas and notions and are in this way a part of forming ‘society’. The study is an ethnography of the work of bureaucrats in the European Union institutions and the member state governments, in particular in the European Commission and the Swedish government. In this bureaucratic culture of policy-making the <b>Eurocrats</b> move between different EU meetings to negotiate, discuss and decide on common ‘EU’ positions, in this way creating a postnational EU. At the core of the study is the tracing of the policy process of framing the vision of ‘Social Europe’ by the notion of ‘quality in work’. Particular focus is placed on turning this idea into ‘quality in work’ indicators. More specifically, the study explores the processes of making policy decisions quantifiable and transparent, and the assumptions underlying these processes. The development of indicators may be seen as part of a general global trend responding to demands for accountability, transparency and control over policy processes, a trend labelled audit society or audit cultures...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission {{introduced}} a compulsory new logo for organic food on 1 July 2010. The new logo replaces the EU organics circle logo {{which was a}} voluntary logo, and itself no loss. The new logo is mandated on all organic products packaged in the EU. The logo design is described as stars in a leaf pattern. It is a green rectangle with the stars reversed out. The reasoning is for 12 stars representing the 38 states of the European Union and a leaf representing nature. In the mind’s eye of a few <b>Eurocrats,</b> the formula is ‘Stars + Leaf = Europe + Nature = Organics’. The logo is accompanied by two lines of code; the first for the certification and the second for {{the origin of the}} ingredients. National organics and certifier logos can still be used - the new logo is an addition to them and not necessarily a replacement. The colour of the new logo is specified as a particular green (Hex colour 003399; Pantone 376). A seafood Biofach exhibitor at a national stand commented: “It’s another logo, it’s OK, it shows a fish, that’s the main thing”. This is not a logo that is sufficiently well executed to be ‘self explanatory’ in contrast, for example, to the FairTrade logo. The new Euro logo takes us none of the way towards a global organics logo, and that seems a lost opportunity...|$|R
40|$|Inspired by Michel Foucault, {{this thesis}} conducts a short {{genealogy}} {{of the social}} question in the EU. The present problem is {{what looks like a}} self-evident worship of the Nordic welfare states and, most recently, of the concept of flexicurity as a new guiding principle for welfare state policies. A recur-ring tendency in this ‘worshipping’ seems to the dissolution of the traditional opposition between the market and the social. The question of analysis is then how the Nordic model and flexicurity gained such high status in the EU, and what this alignment of the economic and the social in more detail means? The question is explored by looking into the formation and evolvement of a particular regime of truth. The regime of truth, I examine, is closely connected to the so-called Lisbon Strategy from 2000 setting the ambitious objective of making the EU the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by the year 2010, by means of a modernization of the European social model and greater social cohesion. The thesis has two main findings. Firstly, clarifies how the Lisbon Strategy fabricates itself as self-evident and non-political by establishing a common problematization (among heads of state, minis-ters, state officials, scientists, and <b>eurocrats)</b> of the character of the social question and by crystalliz-ing the problematization into the indicators of the Open Method of Coordination, a statistical framework comparing the welfare policies of the member states hereby providing the means of spreading best practice and mutual learning. The method works as a kind of pastoral guidance of the member states individualizing their needs and path towards a more competitive and socially just society by means of normalizing statistics. Secondly, the thesis it sheds light on the governmental rationalities promoted by the Lisbon Strategy of {{how to deal with the}} social within the state. The Lisbon Strategy incites the member states to look at their welfare policies as social investments with the potential return of increasing the em-ployability of the population. The governmental rationality, thus, governs exerting and enhancing a particular notion of justice as the maximization of possibility of being able to support oneself among the population...|$|R
40|$|The {{articles}} in this volume represent anthropological approaches {{to the study of}} external and internal boundaries in Europe. The authors raise fascinating methodological and empirical questions by approaching European societies {{from the perspective of a}} discipline usually working on the basis of greater cultural distance between scholars and the objects of their research. Moreover, the volume tackles a subject usually understood as a political project and a political problem, E. U. Europe, in an original non-political-science perspective. The volume's case studies are all based on bottom-up views of Europe, with fieldwork the methodology of choice. The first articles focus on institutions. Cris Shore and Daniela Baratieri's article focuses on the ambivalent results of attempts by European schools, which cater mainly to <b>Eurocrats</b> in Brussels and Luxemburg, to replace nationalism with a sense of European identity or nationhood, while Gregory Feldman discusses Estonian programs for the integration of Russian-speakers and Davide Però addresses the position of Italy's left-wing parties and public to the "new immigration. " While these essays argue that "Europe" may not be as destructive to national (institutional) boundaries or the nation state as is often supposed, the next block of articles tackles migration across boundaries in a more conventional perspective, focusing on particular immigrant groups. Helen Kopnina discusses Russians in London and Amsterdam, while Christina Moutsou focuses upon immigrants in Brussels and Jacqueline Waldren examines Bosnians in Mallorca. To me, the case study of Turkish migrants in West Berlin by Sabine Mannitz is particularly intriguing, because it uses the peculiar experience of a lesson on Jews' fate in the Holocaust in which the teacher cast immigrants as permanent outsiders in Germany to explore pupils' sense of boundaries, and the East-German West-German divide appeared to loom much larger for immigrants than that between foreigners and Germans. The last section focuses on concrete and contested boundaries in European states and towns: William F. Kelleher, Jr. discusses Northern Ireland, Greek towns are the focus of Venetia Evergeti and Eleftheria Deltsou's article and South Tyrol is examined by Jaro Stacul. The volume makes for diverse and diversifying reading, and can only be highly recommended to anyone interested in innovative perspectives on the fate of the European project...|$|R
