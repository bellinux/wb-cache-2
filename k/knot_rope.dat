5|$|The golden ratio {{seems to}} be {{reflected}} in many Egyptian constructions, including the pyramids, but its use {{may have been an}} unintended consequence of the ancient Egyptian practice of combining the use of <b>knotted</b> <b>ropes</b> with an intuitive sense of proportion and harmony.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the course}} of the play other items are lowered from above: three cubes of varying sizes, a length of <b>knotted</b> <b>rope</b> and - always just out of reach - a “tiny carafe, to which is {{attached}} a huge label inscribed WATER.” ...|$|R

50|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Shane Drake and premiered June 20, 2016. The video sees Scott isolated in the woods, where she comes across a <b>knotted</b> <b>rope</b> in a stream. Flashes of thorns, {{as well as the}} <b>knots</b> in the <b>rope,</b> are interpreted by Jon Freeman of Rolling Stone to be symbolic of the struggles Scott's character faces, with her eventual disentanglement representing her rising above the tragedy.|$|R
50|$|The Desert Fathers of the 3rd to 5th centuries, used pebbles or <b>knotted</b> <b>ropes</b> {{to count}} prayers, {{typically}} the Jesus Prayer ("Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, {{have mercy on}} me, a sinner"). The invention is attributed to Anthony the Great or his associate Pachomius the Great in the 4th century.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so," [...] {{answered}} Bacri; [...] "we must proceed wisely {{as well as}} with caution.--Go, Angela," [...] he said to the maiden, {{who entered}} the room at that moment, [...] "open the closet {{at the head of the}} terrace stair; you will find a thin <b>knotted</b> <b>rope</b> hanging there,--fetch it hither." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Half an hour must elapse ere we can venture {{forth with}} safety," [...] said Bacri. [...] "'Tis well {{that you have}} brought the <b>knotted</b> <b>rope</b> with you. Mariano knows how to use it. He will explain the mode of escape which you must follow, while I hold private {{converse}} with my brother." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Knots</b> {{weaken the}} <b>rope</b> {{in which they}} are made. [...] When <b>knotted</b> <b>rope</b> is {{strained}} to its breaking point, it almost always fails at the knot or close to it, unless it is defective or damaged elsewhere. The bending, crushing, and chafing forces that hold a knot in place also unevenly stress rope fibers and ultimately lead to a reduction in strength. The exact mechanisms that cause the weakening and failure are complex and are the subject of continued study.|$|R

50|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, a rope pump is being used in {{conjunction}} with wind turbines. This easy-to- construct pump works by pulling a <b>knotted</b> <b>rope</b> through a pipe (usually a simple PVC pipe) causing the water to be pulled up into the pipe. This type of pump has become common in Nicaragua and other places.|$|R
50|$|Pharaoh-King Tutankhamun has {{a famous}} {{representation}} of the Nine Bows, and the nine foreign enemies. The tomb was closed with a <b>knotted</b> <b>rope,</b> and the rope impressed with a clay seal. The seal contains an impression with Anubis, reclining as a jackal, at the top list of the Nine foreign rebels, in a long, vertical cartouche-image.|$|R
60|$|The moon, {{who sees}} many strange {{things on the}} Banks, looked down on a slim youth in knickerbockers and a red jersey, {{staggering}} around the cluttered decks of a seventy-ton schooner, while behind him, waving a <b>knotted</b> <b>rope,</b> walked, after the manner of an executioner, a boy who yawned and nodded between the blows he dealt.|$|R
40|$|Many {{experiments}} {{have been done}} to determine the relative strength of different knots, and these show that the break in a <b>knotted</b> <b>rope</b> almost invariably occurs at a point just outside the `entrance' to the knot. The influence of knots on the properties of polymers has become of great interest, {{in part because of}} their effect on mechanical properties. Knot theory applied to the topology of macromolecules indicates that the simple trefoil or `overhand' knot is likely to be present with high probability in any long polymer strand. Fragments of DNA have been observed to contain such knots in experiments and computer simulations. Here we use ab initio computational methods to investigate the effect of a trefoil knot on the breaking strength of a polymer strand. We find that the knot weakens the strand significantly, and that, like a <b>knotted</b> <b>rope,</b> it breaks under tension {{at the entrance to the}} knot. Comment: 3 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
50|$|On <b>knotted</b> <b>rope</b> halters, the <b>knot</b> {{often is}} used under the jaw {{both as a}} {{decorative}} knot, and also to fashion the lower loop onto which a lead rope is attached. On a rope halter, the fiador knot is made from one continuous piece of rope, and is, along {{with a series of}} double overhand knots, one of two types of knots that comprise most rope halters.|$|R
60|$|Ladders.--A notched pole or a <b>knotted</b> <b>rope</b> makes a ladder. We hear {{of people}} who have tied sheets {{together}} to let themselves down high walls, when making an escape. The best way of making a long rope from sheets, is to cut them into strips of about six inches broad, and with these to twist a two-stranded rope, or else to plait a three-stranded one.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first song}} is a {{dialogue}} between the alto voice and the trumpet, setting a text by Baudelaire about refusing to submit to authority. The music of [...] "Frei" [...] is light and mercurial, {{in contrast to the}} grim humour of the text, in which Harlequin receives a <b>knotted</b> <b>rope</b> from the king. In a gesture reminiscent of the Alexandrian Solution, the jester defiantly cuts the knots with an axe [...]|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank Heaven!" [...] {{came the}} voice from above. [...] "I have been {{watching}} you, and thought {{you one of the}} Austrian pigs. Quick! They are coming--I can hear them;" [...] and at the same instant Barney saw something drop from the window to the ground. He crossed the alley quickly, and could have shouted in relief for what he found there--the end of a <b>knotted</b> <b>rope</b> dangling from above.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, then, stand aside," [...] said Dominick, as {{he retreated}} {{a few paces}} and threw off his coat, while Malines still stood in a {{threatening}} attitude, {{with an expression of}} contempt on his face. [...] "My friends," [...] he said, as he slowly rolled up his shirt-sleeves, showing a pair of arms which, although not bulky, displayed an amount of sinews and muscle that was suggestive of <b>knotted</b> <b>ropes</b> under a fair skin-- ...|$|R
50|$|Following Rachelle's eviction, Jon was crowned the new HOH in the On the Ropes competition, {{and decided}} to go after Heather, as he {{believed}} that she didn't benefit his game at all. Also, she {{proved to be an}} extreme physical threat, remaining neck-in-neck with him during the competition. The houseguests were attached to a long, winding, <b>knotted</b> <b>rope,</b> and had to crawl, climb, and untie the rope to get to the end, all while in freezing cold water.|$|R
50|$|Home {{with her}} husband and two children, she begins to {{experience}} doubts about her life and relationship, and thinks fondly of Marc. Marc meanwhile tries to mount his horse using a <b>knotted</b> <b>rope</b> and upper body strength, but panics and is knocked unconscious and taken to hospital, and in a dream scene he is seen stunt-riding a white horse along a beach. He makes a recovery and mounts his horse again, with more success and an adapted saddle.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek District Railway (Short Line) passed from Cripple Creek through St. Peter's Dome to Colorado Springs. In 1902, about 200,000 people took the train along {{the rim of}} South Cheyenne Cañon to Colorado Springs. It was a picnic and camping site. The {{vertical}} ascent of 10 ft was first made by a wooden ladder and then a spiral staircase. It is now made by using a <b>knotted</b> <b>rope.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Tao Te Ching focuses {{upon the}} {{beginnings}} of society, and describes a golden age in the past, comparable {{with the ideas of}} Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Human problems arose from the [...] "invention" [...] of culture and civilization. In this idealized past, [...] "the people should have no use for any form of writing save <b>knotted</b> <b>ropes,</b> should be contented with their food, pleased with their clothing, satisfied with their homes, should take pleasure in their rustic tasks."

50|$|In 1680 these peoples {{mounted the}} Pueblo Revolt {{and were the}} first Native American group to {{successfully}} revolt against the Spanish; they expelled the Spanish colonists from the area for 12 years. The code for the action was a <b>knotted</b> <b>rope</b> carried from the leaders to each pueblo by a runner; the number of knots signified {{the number of days}} to wait before beginning the uprising. It began one day early, August 10, 1680; by August 21, Santa Fe fell to 2,500 Puebloan warriors.|$|R
