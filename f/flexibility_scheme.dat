40|$|EU {{electricity}} markets are facing fundamental challenges {{as a result}} of the EU goal to increase the share of the renewable energy sources. This policy negatively influences profitability of the conventional producers known theoretically as "missing money" problem. As the conventional plants are crucial to offset the variability of renewable, this policy puts the stability of the whole grid at risk in long-term under the current electricity market design. The thesis tests and confirms the hypothesis that there is currently a "missing money" effect on the German energy market through a dynamic programming model. Secondly, three types of the capacity remuneration mechanisms (CRMs) are implemented (capacity payments, strategic reserve and capacity auction) in order to deal with "missing money" which mostly eliminates the missing money problem depending on the setting. The most effective CRM seems be the capacity auction model as the price is set dynamically by the market players and not arbitrarily by central regulator. The thesis further supports the creation of the demand <b>flexibility</b> <b>scheme</b> due to the expected low costs. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|E
40|$|A pragmatic {{approach}} is taken at analyzing and improving Sales and Operations Planning {{in a project}} based, engineer-to-order product line. Variability of product and components configurations and long lead times of the sales process and of material procurement during project execution place additional planning challenges in comparison with a standardized high volume product business. The study focuses on improving the visibility on future customer orders and on reducing the procurement lead time of project material. Due {{to the nature of}} the market and the customers of the studied product line, incoming orders timing is very uncertain when viewed on a project by project basis. However, there is a specific dynamic when the sales pipeline is analyzed on aggregate: Tenders that end up converting into a customer order will do so sooner rather than later. Historical data and observations are used to develop and propose a probabilistic model that connects today's open tenders to the expected new business out of those tenders. The organization is able to use this model to estimate what the current activity of the sales force can produce in terms of new business. The expected benefit is that the organization can act proactively if there is an expected reduction in incoming business from a specific region or major customer; it can also make targeted efforts to increase sales activity towards that region or customer. To increase its competitiveness when bidding for new projects, the organization has embarked on an effort to reduce the overall project execution lead time. A significant portion of this lead time is waiting time for project specific material (which comprises the biggest part of the BOM in money terms). A supplier <b>flexibility</b> <b>scheme</b> is proposed, under which a material order is placed in two phases: first the desired delivery time and the component rough specification are specified, and later on the exact specs are given to the supplier. An optimization model that utilizes the above concept is developed and offers the organization an optimal way to plan the project material procurement, given a desired reduction in procurement lead time. The expected benefit is that there is a justified and optimal method to reduce procurement time without building excessive material stock; it also sheds light to the "constraints" (specific materials or suppliers) that need to be lifted for further lead time reduction. by Andreas Christogiannis.

Some transported services may survive capacity degradations, however others require full recovery. In case of a failure, besides the amount of recovered capacity, requirements originated from different client services can be distinguished according to the time to recovery, as well.

40|$|Abstract:- To {{solve the}} {{problems}} in multi-objective transmission network planning, a novel model based on Fuzzy Set Pair Analysis (FSPA) method is presented, in which economics, reliability and <b>flexibility</b> of the <b>schemes</b> are all taken into account. Economics and reliability are indicated by the investment cost and the outage cost respectively, and flexibility of the network is quantified by Available Transfer Capability (ATC) for the first time. The involvement of flexibility in the objective function can improve the adaptability of the optimal scheme to the uncertain future and avoid unnecessary compensation investment effectively. The planning schemes are assessed by two opposite pairs: certainty- uncertainty and identity-contrary, by FSPA method, which produce more comprehensive estimations.

40|$|The use of enzyme {{immunoassay}} to detect St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) viral antigen in vector mosquitoes enhances {{the effectiveness of}} surveillance because infected mosquitoes can be identified more rapidly than with conventional virus isolation systems {{and because it is}} a simple and accessible procedure. Infectivity among mosquitoes experimentally infected with SLE virus was lost within 24 h after the mosquitoes were stored at 27 degrees C and 80 % relative humidity; however, viral antigen remained stable under these conditions and could be detected by {{enzyme immunoassay}} 2 weeks later. Desiccation further extended the period during which antigen could be detected to 6 weeks.

A previous proposal of a neural dynamics that solves this dilemma by inducing an instability when a “condition of sat-isfaction ” signals that an action goal has been reached does not scale to more complex sequences. We address this limitation by showing how the neural dynamics can be generalized to generate hierarchically structured behaviors.
