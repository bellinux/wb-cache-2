5|$|Jane Austen lived {{her entire}} life {{as part of a}} large and close-knit family on the lower fringes of the English gentry.

During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried and then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth.

At the age of 12, she tried her own hand at dramatic writing; she wrote three short plays during <b>her</b> <b>teenage</b> years.|$|E

5|$|Within days, some of Kennedy's aides were urging McGovern {{to run in}} his place; their {{antipathy}} towards McCarthy {{and ideological}} opposition to Humphrey made them unwilling to support either candidate.

Based on a recently enacted strict state drugs law, Terry now faced a minimum five-year prison sentence if found guilty.
