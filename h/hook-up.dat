5|$|After seeing Ned Flanders reject {{an offer}} from a crooked cable man to get an illegal cable <b>hook-up</b> for $50, Homer chases after the cable man and takes the offer. Homer likes the new {{channels}} and {{spends a lot of}} time watching the television along with his family. Lisa, however, feels suspicious about the cable <b>hook-up.</b> Following a Sunday school lesson regarding the existence and nature of Hell, Lisa becomes terrified of violations of the Ten Commandments, the adherence to which she is assured will keep one's soul safe from Hell. She fears that because Homer violated the Eighth Commandment, he will go to Hell when he dies.|$|E
5|$|There are seventy-two {{campsite}}s at Black Moshannon State Park. Each campsite {{has access}} to washhouses with flush toilets, showers, and laundry tubs. The campsites also have fire rings and picnic tables. There is also an organized group tenting area, which can accommodate a group of up to 60persons. Some sites allow pets; there are also twelve full <b>hook-up</b> sites available. These have electric service, water and sewer hook-ups as well. Nine sites are tent-only.|$|E
5|$|Each driver {{cell in the}} LIFE {{baseline}} design contained two of the high-density diode arrays {{arranged on}} either side of a large slab of laser glass. The arrays were provided cooling via <b>hook-up</b> pipes {{at either end of the}} module. The initial laser pulse was provided by a preamplifier module similar to the one from the NIF, the output of which was switched into the main beamline via a mirror and Pockel's cell optical switch. To maximize the energy deposited into the beam from the laser glass, optical switches were used to send the beam to mirrors to reflect the light through the glass four times, in a fashion similar to NIF. Finally, focussing and optical cleanup was provided by optics {{on either side of}} the glass, before the beam exited the system through a frequency converter at one end.|$|E

5|$|Susan hires Bradley Fox (Aaron Jeffery) {{as deputy}} editor {{to take on}} some of her workload. She also begins {{attending}} a pole dancing class at the community centre. Susan becomes concerned when Bradley and Summer start dating, especially when they use the newspaper office for a late night <b>hook-up.</b> Susan checks Bradley's references and discovers that he has lied. She also learns that he was fired from his last job for dating his boss' daughter. Susan briefly falls out with Summer when she tries to warn her about Bradley. Susan's sister, Carmel, comes to visit and she develops feelings for Karl. Carmel makes sexual advances towards Karl, which he rejects. Susan is angry with Carmel, but eventually forgives her. Susan is shocked when she learns Paul has sold the Erinsborough News, without consulting her.

Sarah apologises to Susan for everything that happened in the past, but Susan struggles to deal with her presence. When Karl tells her that he loves her, Susan rejects him. She later hands him divorce papers and confronts Sarah.|$|E
5|$|As Jerry is {{sleeping}} on the plane he dreams of returning to his apartment only to find several FBI agents there interrogating Kramer, who apparently has ratted out Jerry. When Jerry protests that {{he had nothing to}} do with it, they reveal that the Russian was an undercover FBI agent. Jerry tries to flee only to be gunned down by the agents. This jolts him awake. He finds his show is canceled due to bad weather, and George picks up Jerry at the airport. Jerry is initially amazed that George is perfectly willing, even anxious to drive Jerry home. When he informs George they cannot go back to his apartment because of the baby shower, George insists and Jerry discovers that George is wearing the red shirt and is just using the favor as a chance to encounter Leslie at the baby shower. Meanwhile, Kramer and the two Russians crash the shower to install cable television, start to eat all the food and get into a heated argument. When George and Jerry arrive, George's plan proves unsuccessful, as he cannot muster the courage confront Leslie and instead awkwardly tries to curry her favor. He is interrupted when one of the other party guests (Margaret Reed as Mary) suddenly confronts Jerry because he never called her back after a date. This unpleasant scene is the final straw and the guests leave hurriedly. On the way out of the bathroom the angry woman bumps Leslie and her dessert into George, adding a chocolate cake stain to the Bosco stain already on the shirt. Jerry changes his mind about the cable <b>hook-up,</b> but is still charged with a large amount of money. When he refuses to pay, the Russians break the picture tube of his television set.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the electricity production plant (e.g. wind turbine and solar panel), infrastructure for energy storage and power conversion and a <b>hook-up</b> to the regular electricity grid is usually needed and/or foreseen. Although a hookup to the regular electricity grid is not essential, it helps to decrease costs by allowing financial recompensation schemes. In the developing world however, the start-up cost for this equipment is generally too high, thus leaving {{no choice but to}} opt for alternative set-ups.|$|E
25|$|However, {{a report}} {{released}} by the Israel Union for Environmental Defense in 2010 found that 500,000 homes in Israel are not linked to a central sewage system. The vast majority of these homes are in 150 Arab communities which have no sewage <b>hook-up</b> and whose waste is therefore discharged into cesspits or the local environment. Jerusalem and Ariel were reported as dumping some of their refuse into streams. Overall, only 2.7% of raw sewage flows into streams and none into the sea.|$|E

25|$|In 1989, Deere {{replaced}} the 6620, 7720, and 8820 {{with a new}} line of completely redesigned 'Maximizer' combines that included the 9400, 9500, and 9600 walker combines. These combines were completely redesigned and featured a center-mounted cab, rear-mounted engine, and more comforts in the cab. Also in 1989, Deere was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1997, Deere celebrated 50 years of self-propelled combine production, and the 1997 models featured a 50th-anniversary decal. In 1998, the 9410, 9510, and 9610 were introduced. These were essentially the same machines, but with minor upgrades. Deere dealers offered '10 series' upgrades to owners of older 9000 series Maximizer combines. In 1999, Deere introduced the 50 series Maximizer combines. These machines featured significant cosmetic upgrades including a more streamlined appearance, improved ergonomics in the cab, PTO shaft-style header <b>hook-up,</b> and the larger models were available as rotary machines which were a complete departure from the combines that Deere had built in the past.|$|E
25|$|On February 19, 1977, Wonder was {{nominated}} for seven Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, an award that he had already won twice, in 1974 and 1975, for Innervisions and Fulfillingness’ First Finale. Since 1973, Stevie’s presence at the Grammy ceremonies had been consistent – he attended most of the ceremonies and also used to perform on stage. But in 1976, he did not attend as he was not nominated for any awards (as he had not released any new material during the past year). Paul Simon, who received the Grammy for Album of the Year in that occasion (for Still Crazy After All These Years) jokingly thanked Stevie “for not releasing an album” that year. A year after, Wonder {{was nominated}} for Songs in the Key of Life in that same category, and was widely favored by many critics to take the award. The other nominees were Breezin’ by George Benson, Chicago X by Chicago, Silk Degrees by Boz Scaggs, and the other favorite, Peter Frampton’s Frampton Comes Alive!, which was also a huge critical and commercial success. Wonder was again absent from the ceremony, as he had developed an interest in visiting Africa. In February he traveled to Nigeria for two weeks, primarily to explore his musical heritage, as he put it. A satellite <b>hook-up</b> was arranged so that Stevie could be awarded his Grammys from across the sea. Bette Midler announced the results during the ceremony, and the audience was only able to see Wonder at a phone smiling and giving thanks. The video signal was poor and the audio inaudible. Andy Williams went on to make a public blunder when he asked the blind-since-birth Wonder, “Stevie, can you see us?” In all, Wonder won four out of seven nominations at the Grammys: Album of the Year, Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, Best Male R Vocal Performance and Producer of the Year.|$|E

500|$|Lisa {{begins to}} oppose other {{examples}} of common thievery all around her, even convincing Marge to pay the cost on two grapes she sampled in a grocery store. Lisa later pays a visit to Reverend Lovejoy at church, where he suggests that Lisa cannot turn her father in to the police for the illegal <b>hook-up,</b> since she must continue to [...] "Honour Thy Father and Thy Mother", according to the Fifth Commandment. He instead encourages Lisa to not watch anything on Homer's cable <b>hook-up,</b> setting a good example that he hopes others will follow. Marge pleads with Homer to either cut the cable or pay for it, but he refuses to do either, saying that the cable will {{stay as long as}} he desires. Meanwhile, Bart sets up posters on the back door for his showing of a porn channel for 50 cents, but he is caught a few seconds later by Homer, who forbids him from doing it.|$|E

500|$|... "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment" [...] {{was written}} by {{freelance}} writer Steve Pepoon and directed by Rich Moore. It was originally going to be named [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment", but the writers decided to include Lisa in the title because they wanted the cast {{to feel as if}} all their characters were equally represented on the show. The episode is based on the Eighth Commandment ("thou shall not steal"), {{which is one of the}} Ten Commandments. The Simpsons writer Al Jean said that [...] "whenever people come up to me and say that The Simpsons is just sort of this outrageous show that has no moral center, I always point them to this , where Homer gets an illegal cable <b>hook-up</b> (which many people have done in real life) and suffers enormous consequences." ...|$|E

There are 19 rustic cabins, each with a refrigerator, stove, fireplace, table with chairs, and beds. There is a 70-site tent and camper campground along Pennsylvania Route154. Some of the campsites have an electric <b>hook-up,</b> {{and there is a}} central shower facility with water and restrooms located nearby. Three organized group tenting areas, each capable of accommodating 30 people, are also available north of the cabins. They may also be used for one large group of up to 90 campers. Non-denominational Christian worship services, sponsored by the Pennsylvania Council of Churches, are held in a wooded chapel at the park on Sunday mornings during the summer.|$|E

Homer decides to have a party and invites all of his friends {{to come over and}} watch the fight. Lisa tries to boycott the party, so this results in Homer making her stay outside on the lawn. Homer’s conscience eventually bothers him, more in the form of his daughter's distress than a moral objection to stealing cable due to a hallucination that he goes to prison for stealing cable. He finally gives in to Lisa's protests, begrudgingly choosing not to watch the last minutes of the fight, and Marge and Maggie join them as well. Bart refuses to give in, but Homer drags him outside by force. The family sits the fight out and when everyone has left, Homer hesitantly cuts his cable <b>hook-up</b> while ignoring Bart's objection, but he accidentally ends up cutting the power to the whole neighborhood.|$|E
