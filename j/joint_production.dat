40|$|International audiencePoor {{selective}} gears like bottom trawlers {{are known}} to induce <b>joint</b> <b>productions</b> ie catch of several categories of fish by targeting one category in particular. <b>Joint</b> <b>productions</b> can be inter-species or intra-species. They can be retained to be sold or discarded {{most of the time}} with high mortality rates when caught by trawlers. <b>Joint</b> <b>productions</b> make management more complicated as they make classical solutions known to reduce or negate the effects of negative externalities difficult to apply. In this paper, the bio-economic impact of changing gear to reduce <b>joint</b> <b>productions</b> and so limit the external effects is studied {{in the case of the}} Nephrops trawl fishery in the bay of Biscay. The example of the Nephrops pot fishery of Loch Torridon (Scotland) compared to the Nephrops trawl fishery in the bay of Biscay enables to discuss the exploitation conditions leading to the success of an alternative gear. An alternative Nephrops pot métier for the Nephrops trawler fleet is parameterized and the bio-economic implications of a gear changement are analyzed in the case of a normative trawl interdiction and under several economic regulations inciting to gear changement...|$|R
