Initially he spends most of his time working, but with Nanny's subtle prompting he begins to spend more and more time with his family. As the series progressed there were increasingly prevalent hints of a romantic interest between Everett and Nanny.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. This study {{examined}} {{a possible explanation}} for the frequently reported finding that female caregivers perceive more psychological distress than do male caregivers. Our 'identity-relevant stress' hypothesis asserts that feelings of incompetence with respect to caregiving are more strongly associated with psychological distress in women than in men. Women who feel competent with respect to caregiving may report levels of distress as low as that of male caregivers. Design. This study has a cross-sectional design. Methods. Psychological distress (CES-D) was measured in 32 female and 36 male partners of patients suffering from various types of cancer. Furthermore, partners' perceptions of caregiving performance and patients' perceptions of partners' supportive and unsupportive behaviour were assessed. Results. Only among female partners were self-efficacy and personal accomplishment regarding caregiving found to be positively linked to distress. Also, in contrast to male partners, female partners reported more distress when they acted less supportively. Conclusion. The difference in psychological distress between female and male caregivers seems to be carried by a subgroup of partners who feel that they are not <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> at caregiving...|$|E
40|$|With {{all of the}} new {{technologies}} and buzzwords in the computer field, one might wonder why American Programmer returns to fundamental topics [...] peopleware, project management, and the like [...] so often. One reason is that our industry still isn't <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> at the fundamentals, and another reason is that there always seems to be something new to say about them. Such is the case with software metrics: it's beennearly two years since we last covered the topic, and there are indeed some interesting new things to say. But Michael Mah and Larry Putnam (both from Quantitative Software Management) remind us that we tend to get distracted by the gadgets and buzzwords in the metrics field, just as we do in other aspects of computing. As they point out, "A key point to consider on metrics is this: rather than just musing on what 'new metric ' might apply in the ever-changing world of software, we should also be asking ourselves the more basic question, 'What will we do with metrics? ' [...] The problem oftentimes is that organizations don't have the basics down before they pile on measure after measure.

40|$|The {{public sector}} in the United States {{continues}} to wrestle with the challenges of complying with legislation such as the Information Technology Reform Act and the Government Perfor mance and Results Act that requires federal agencies to align their programs with the overall mission of the agency and to report their success and failures {{on an annual basis}} to Congress. The results unfortunately have not been very good. The Office of Management and Budget and the General Accounting Office have found in their reviews that the federal government as a whole has not been <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> aligning their programs with the goals and establishing effective performance measures. The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) offers a methodology that {{can be applied to the}} federal sec tor to enable more effective alignment of programs to mission and a tangible means for measur ing the results. Some agencies, particularly within the Department of Defense, have embraced the Balanced Scorecard as a means for achieving these objectives, and have successfully trans formed their programs to achieve higher productivity, aligning with the mission of the agency and resulting in higher efficiencies. This paper discusses the overall effectiveness and applicability of the Balanced Scorecard to the federal sector of the US Government, including a specific real-world application by the De fense Finance and Accounting Services (DFAS).

40|$|Humans and {{machines}} are both {{involved in the}} creation of legal research resources. For legal information retrieval systems, the human-curated finding aid is being overtaken by the computer algorithm. But human-curated finding aids still exist. One of them is the West Key Number system. The Key Number system’s headnote classification of case law, started back in the nineteenth century, was and is the creation of humans. The retrospective headnote classification of the cases in Lexis’s case databases, started in 1999, was created primarily - although not exclusively - with computer algorithms. So how do these two very different systems deal with a similar headnote from the same case, when they link the headnote to the digest and citator functions in their respective databases? This paper continues the author’s investigation into this question, looking at the relevance of results from digest and citator searches run on matching headnotes in Westlaw and Lexis for ninety important federal and state cases, to see how each system performs. For digests, where the results are curated where a human has made a judgment about the meaning of a case and placed it in a classification system humans still have an advantage. For citators, where algorithm is battling algorithm to find relevant results, {{it is a matter of}} the better algorithm winning. But neither algorithm is <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of finding all the relevant results; the overlap between the two citator systems is not that large. The lesson for researchers: know how your legal research system was created, what involvement, if any, humans had in the curation of the system, and what a researcher can and cannot expect from the system being used...|$|E
30|$|A related trend, {{one better}} {{illustrating}} the limited persistence in undergraduate programs in which mathematics plays a significant part, is {{the decline of}} enrollment in mathematics courses above first year. In the 2014 – 2015 school year, the Department of Mathematics had 6340 students enrolled in first-year courses, 1859 in second year, 464 in third year, and just 32 in fourth, meaning that the department had ‘filtered’ out over 70 % of its students each year. Although the numbers in first year {{and to some extent}} in second year represent service teaching to students in other programs, most students in first year at this university are registered as “University 1 ” students and have not yet selected a major. With so many students coming through our classes in their first year of post-secondary study, it seems that we are not <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of attracting them to continue with the study of mathematics. As one particular illustration, we can compare undergraduate students in a large, non-STEM faculty such as the Faculty of Arts to those in the Faculty of Science. Whereas Arts has 4570 students registered in first-year courses, 1803 students in second year, and 1789 students in third year, Science has 4270 in first year, 2050 in second year, and only 1303 in third year (most of the degrees conferred in these two faculties are 3 -year degrees). The sharp decline in students registered in second-year courses versus third-year courses (and thus being able to graduate with a 3 -year degree) in Science is not seen in Arts, where there is very nearly the same number of students registered in second-year courses as that in third-year courses.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. A {{growing number}} of {{programs}} are implemented to enable a smooth resumption of physical activity. “Start to run” is a running program promoted by the athletics federation that has gained a great notoriety in Belgium. It proposes sessions of 10 weeks during which participants are trained to run 5 km without stop (10 km {{for those who are}} not beginners). No data seems to be available about the coaching process in this specific context of active leisure. The {{purpose of this study was}} to enlarge knowledge on this topic. Methods. Based on the principles of the qualitative research, we analyzed three sites: three groups involved in a Start to run session in different communities of the Liege’s area (Wallonia, Belgium). In all sites, data were collected before, during, at the end and 12 weeks after the session. They provided information on the context as well as on the process (coaches and participants behaviors and perceptions), and participants’ achievement and maintenance. In this paper, we will focus our analysis on the interactive decisions of the coaches. It will be based on the observation of three lessons in each site (2 d, 5 th and 8 th weeks) : one of the authors attended to the training session as participant observer. Moreover, we will also use data collected through interviews (description of the organization and content of the program) and questionnaires (feelings about the lessons). Participants were also requested to provide their perceptions about the lessons. As evidenced above, the validity of the analysis is guaranteed by the triangulation of the data. Results. The three coaches described a similar teaching model but only subject # 2 pointed out technical drills. Only subject # 3 respected the “official” program developed by the athletics federation. The two other adapted it according to their experience and purposes of their groups. All of them considered that they were providing enough feedback and were active. On the other hand, they thought themselves as needing to encourage more and to be more effective in group management. Globally, participants confirmed the opinions of their respective coaches but they seemed more critical in group # 3, showing a lower satisfaction about the motivational behaviors and feedback. The observation pointed out some problems in the clarity of the explanations (subject # 1) and some divergences were reported with the actors. Discussion. The triangulation of the data allows us to consider that the three coaches are <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> and adapt themselves to the expectations and needs of the participants. The identification of the positive and negative aspects in each subject provides a basis to propose some recommendations. Moreover, we pointed out that encouraged to speak about their own teaching process, all coaches modified spontaneously their interactive decisions during the study. This underlines the interest of this systematic analysis. Peer reviewe...|$|E
