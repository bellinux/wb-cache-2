He comes back, obviously not 100 percent. The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the morale is high to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more out of your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that." ...|$|E

500|$|Very {{little of}} the design from Freelance Police was carried over into Save the World; LucasArts still held onto the assets created for use in Freelance Police, and Telltale was wary of using similar design patterns. While Ferguson and Purcell had both been {{involved}} with the canceled LucasArts project, Grossman had not. The team decided to just start from fresh, and pursue a different treatment of the game's subject. Purcell himself wanted to ensure that the game conveyed the [...] "gritty" [...] feel of the original comics—something he felt was lacking from the LucasArts renditions of the franchise. Grossman stated that [...] "we wanted to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more of that dirt on the streets, and the paper cups and people being mean and nasty". This [...] "gritty" [...] feeling also influenced artistic design. For instance, on Purcell's suggestion, the sky was changed from blue to yellow in the street outside Sam and Max's office, instantly making the environment feel [...] "filthy and disgusting".|$|E

The same year, Dench reteamed with {{director}} John Madden to film Shakespeare in Love (1998), a romantic comedy-drama that depicts a love affair involving playwright William Shakespeare, played by Joseph Fiennes, while he was writing the play Romeo and Juliet. On her performance as Queen Elizabeth I, The New York Times commented that [...] "Dench's shrewd, daunting Elizabeth {{is one of the}} film's utmost treats." [...] The following year, she was nominated for most of the high-profile awards, winning both the Academy Award and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.

The shows themselves varied considerably {{in comparison to the}} previous Chinese Democracy Tour. All of the North American shows took place in smaller-scale clubs, rather than a large arena or stadium. All pyrotechnics were removed from the shows. The European leg of the tour began approximately one month after the band's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Guitarist DJ Ashba discussed a potential follow up to Chinese Democracy in a 2012 interview, stating [...] "I've written and demoed up probably about 12 songs, I think.

These incidents, {{along with many other}} perfidious actions of the Japanese {{throughout}} the Pacific War, led to an American tendency to shoot the dead or wounded Japanese soldiers and those who were attempting to surrender and not take them as prisoners of war easily. Two Marines of Iwo Jima told cautionary tales. One confided: [...] "They always told you take prisoners but we had some bad experiences on Saipan taking prisoners, you take them and then as soon as they get behind the lines they drop grenades and you lose a few more people. You <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> leery of taking prisoners when they are fighting to the death and so are you."

In {{an interview with}} MTV News Ciara said that creating her fifth album was the most personal experience of her career thus far. She elaborated that she had asked close friend and collaborator Missy Elliott to review her early progress on Ciara, [...] "I always share my projects with her early. I'll go to her house and play her the records really early in the process, and it's always so cool, but I just have to pinch myself in moments when I see her a lot. I'll be like, 'OK, this is really my friend,' but it's dope because I really respect her.

6000|$|There {{followed}} a discussion. Perhaps the Boers were {{lying in wait}} for the armoured train; perhaps they had trained a gun on some telegraph post, and would fire the moment the engine passed it; or perhaps, again, they were even now breaking the line behind us. Some Kaffirs approached respectfully, saluting. A Natal Volunteer--one of the cyclists--came forward to interrogate. He was an intelligent little man, with a Martini-Metford rifle, a large pair of field glasses, a dainty pair of grey skin cycling shoes, and a slouch hat. He questioned the natives, and reported their answers. The Kaffirs said that the Dutchmen were assuredly in the neighbourhood. They had been seen only that morning. 'How many?' The reply was vague--twelve, or seventeen, or one thousand; also they had a gun--or five guns--mounted in the old fort, or on the platform of the station, or on the hill behind the town. At daylight they had shelled Colenso. 'But why,' we asked, 'should they shell Colenso?' Evidently to make sure {{of the range of}} some telegraph post. 'It only takes one shell to do the trick with the engine,' said the captain who commanded. 'Got to hit us first, though,' he added. 'Well, let's <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> nearer.' ...|$|E

50|$|A {{score of}} {{two out of}} five was given by Slasherpool, which deemed it a mediocre slasher and dark horror drama, the website's main criticisms being the uninteresting story and poor acting of the {{supporting}} cast, and highlights being Aaron Gaffey's performance and Joe Castro's direction on a limited budget. The Video Graveyard gave the film two and half stars, writing the finale was weak and clichéd, but that overall it is probably Joe Castro's best effort, due Aaron Gaffey's above average performance, the effective atmosphere of grime and sleaze, the bloody deaths, and commendable anti-drug message ("even if the mix of exploitation and preaching <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> unagreeable at times").|$|R
