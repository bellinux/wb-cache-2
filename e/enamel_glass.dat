30|$|Collecting, studying, and copying Islamic {{art from}} earlier centuries became popular in Europe {{during the late}} 19 th century. Known to Europeans {{since the time of}} their {{production}} via extensive trade between the Mamluks and the Venetians, these 13 th– 14 th-century Mamluk mosque lamps were of particular interest to 19 th-century collectors due to their “exotic” and luxurious appearance [2]. Major collections of gilded and <b>enameled</b> <b>glass</b> were formed in the 19 th century; however, these collections were often beset by confusion or misattribution of the individual pieces therein [3]. In particular, French glassmaker Philippe-Joseph Brocard (1831 – 1896), inspired by <b>enameled</b> <b>glass</b> mosque lamps from the Mamluk period, collected such lamps and was especially gifted at creating successful facsimiles of Islamic <b>enameled</b> <b>glass</b> [4]. Many of Brocard’s lamps survive in museum collections. Besides crafting unique artworks in the style of Islamic <b>enameled</b> <b>glass,</b> Brocard is also known to have restored enamels on genuine medieval examples [5]. It is not surprising, then, that such 19 th-century creations could be mistaken for medieval Islamic objects, and vice versa, without detailed technical and material analysis.|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, {{designers}} including René Lalique and Cartier tried {{reduce the}} traditional dominance of diamonds by introducing more colorful gemstones, such as small emeralds, rubies and sapphires. They also placed {{greater emphasis on}} very elaborate and elegant settings, featuring less-expensive materials such as <b>enamel,</b> <b>glass,</b> horn and ivory. Diamonds themselves were cut in less traditional forms; the 1925 Exposition saw {{a large number of}} diamonds cut in the form of tiny rods or matchsticks. The settings for diamonds also changed; More and more often jewelers used platinum instead of gold, since it was strong and flexible, and could set clusters of stones. Jewelers also began to use more dark materials, such as enamels and black onyx, which provided a higher contrast with diamonds.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{a mobile}} home, the {{original}} style diner is narrow and elongated and allows roadway or railway transportation to the restaurant's site. In the traditional diner floorplan, a service counter dominates the interior, with a preparation area {{against the back}} wall and floor-mounted stools for the customers in front. Larger models may have a row of booths against the front wall and at the ends. The decor varied over time. Diners of the 1920s - 1940s feature Art Deco or Streamline Moderne elements or copy the appearance of rail dining cars (though very few are, in fact, refurbished rail cars). They featured porcelain enamel exteriors, some with the name written on the front, others with bands of enamel, others in flutes. Many had a [...] "barrel vault" [...] roofline. Tile floors were common. Diners of the 1950s tended to use stainless steel panels, porcelain <b>enamel,</b> <b>glass</b> blocks, terrazzo floors, Formica and neon sign trim. Diners built in the 2000s generally have a different type of architecture; they are laid out more like restaurants, retaining some aspects of traditional diner architecture (stainless steel and Art Deco elements, usually) while discarding others (the small size, and emphasis on the counter).|$|E
5000|$|The 7.3 cm long {{medallion}} {{is one of}} the few surviving {{items of}} goldsmithery from the ninth century AD. It is not really a piece of religious artwork, but a reliquary for personal purposes. Originally, it was set with two large sapphires in the centre, with the supposed hair of Mary between them, but in 1804 they were replaced with a piece of <b>enamel</b> <b>glass.</b> The talisman is covered in sumptuous gemstones and filigree work, but it lacks the figural depictions, coloured enamels, animal designs and interlace patters which are common in older works. The work is thus dominated by the filigree work itself, along with pearls and jewels in box and palmette designs. Thus the arrow-shaped repoussé decorations between the filigree could recall motfs which were previously common. The shape of the amulet combines three different forms with their own meanings. Firstly, it mimicked the shape of the Palestinian pilgrims' ampules which had been particularly common in the west in the fifth and sixth centuries, and thereby indicated the origins of hair which it originally contained. Secondly, it uses four emeralds and a central stone to create the a cross, just like [...] Finally, the magnificent front serves as a frame for the relic visible behind the trasnlucent gemstone. It is likely that it was used to heal or protect a high ranking individual.|$|E

He had had it built by the {{imperial}} architect Lefuel on a parcel of land acquired from the Péreire brothers in May 1869 and completed a year later - three months before the fall of the imperial regime. That fall forced him to submit his resignation to Gambetta. Sick and fearing his arrest, he got on a train to Boulogne-sur-Mer alone in an attempt to flee to the United Kingdom. However, he was found unconscious in the train compartment and transported to Valéry-en-Caux (Somme), where he asked for safe conduct from princess Marie Cantacuzène (1821-1891), who he had met in 1862 at the house of princess Mathilde. Nieuwerkerke and his daughter Olga (1843-1929) then moved to London, where in October he tried to sell some of the smallest of his objets d'art to the South Kensington Museum. These came from Nieuwerkerke's extraordinary collection (for which no list or inventory survives) of more than 800 historic art objects, in metal and gold, sculptures, ceramics, painted <b>enamel,</b> <b>glass</b> and furniture.

40|$|Dental plaque {{formation}} {{on human}} teeth is the crucial etiologic {{factor in the}} pathogenesis of oral diseases: caries, periodontal diseases, and peri-implantitis. Dental plaque {{has been defined as}} a diverse community of microorganisms found on teeth as a biofilm, embedded in an extracellular polymer matrix of bacterial origin and including host components. Bacterial colonization starts with the adhesion of early colonizers, called pioneer bacteria, to the salivary pellicle on teeth as well as on dental materials within minutes after tooth cleaning. The early colonizers, mostly streptococcoci, contribute to plaque development and ultimately to oral diseases. Investigations of dental plaque, including bacterial adhesion, employ various in vivo and in vitro models and use microscopic methods to assess surface phenomena. The complexity of the oral environment makes it difficult to generate an in vitro system including all relevant aspects. The studies presented (paper I-III) were aimed to adapt two in vitro models, a flow chamber system and a microcalorimetric technique, for investigating adhesion of oral streptococci to human <b>enamel,</b> <b>glass</b> and different dental materials. The dental materials used for the flow chamber experiments (paper I + II) were titanium (Rematitan®M), gold (Neocast 3), ceramic (Vita Omega 900), composite (Tetric Ceram), and four different all-ceramics. The early colonizing Streptococcus sanguinis, S. oralis, and the caries-inducing S. mutans, and S. sobrinus were used as the model organisms. The saliva-coated materials were incubated with the bacteria in the flow chamber during one hour. Number and vitality of adhering bacteria were determined microscopically after staining. The results suggested that variations in the number and vitality of the adherent oral streptococci depend on the surface characteristics of the substrata and the acquired salivary pellicle. It also depended on the bacterial species, as S. mutans and S. sobrinus adhered about 10 x less than S. sanguinis and S. oralis. Isothermal Microcalorimetry (paper III) indeed allowed evaluation of initial bacterial adhesion of S. sanguinis to glass. Maximum heat flow measurements during adhesion were about 10 fold lower than during bacterial growth. Experiments showed that increased surface areas, provided by increased amounts of glass beads, were associated with higher energy release. Heat flow was higher when cells were suspended in human saliva than in PBS. Based on these results both methods appear to be applicable to study bacterial adhesion to new dental restorative or implant materials. Advantages and disadvantages of the methods are discussed...|$|E
