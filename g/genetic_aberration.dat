40|$|The {{most common}} form of {{malignant}} renal neoplasms is renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which is classified into several different subtypes based on the histomorphological features. However, overlaps in these characteristics may present difficulties in the accurate diagnosis of these subtypes, which have different clinical outcomes. Genomic and molecular studies have revealed unique <b>genetic</b> <b>aberrations</b> in each subtype. Knowledge of these genetic changes in hereditary and sporadic renal neoplasms has given an insight into the various proteins and signalling pathways involved in tumour formation and progression. In this review, the <b>genetic</b> <b>aberrations</b> characteristic to each renal neoplasm subtype are evaluated along with the associated protein products and affected pathways. The potential applications of these <b>genetic</b> <b>aberrations</b> and proteins as diagnostic tools, prognostic markers, or therapeutic targets are also assessed...|$|R
50|$|Already {{during his}} period at the UiT, {{the idea of}} cancer {{vaccines}} came to Gaudernack's mind. The fact that cancer cell lines injected into mice {{were killed by the}} animal’s immune system was fascinating in a time with the development of the cancer immunosurveillance theory and cancer immunoediting hypothesis. At the end of the 1980s the three-dimensional structure of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecule was defined in parallel to identification of tumor-specific gene aberrations. In light of these discoveries, Gaudernack positioned himself early in the development of peptide vaccines based on genetic aberrations. One such <b>genetic</b> <b>aberration</b> was mutations in the proto-oncogene Ras subfamily. Together with his team, Gustav was among the first in the world to develop peptide-based cancer vaccines derived from mutated Ras proto-oncogenes. The peptides contain the various mutations that are present in the catalytic site of the Ras protein.|$|E
5000|$|CBF {{members are}} {{frequent}} targets of mutations and rearrangements in human leukemia. Point-mutations in RUNX1 gene {{have been reported}} in patients with familial platelet disorder, myeloid dysplastic syndrome, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. In addition, RUNX1 mutations have also been reported in Acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The RUNX1 and CBFB genes are targets of chromosome rearrangements that create oncogenic fusion genes in leukemia. The chromosome translocation t(12;21) (p13.1;q22) causes the fusion of the ETS variant 6 (ETV6) and RUNX1 genes results in ETV6-RUNX1 gene fusion and is the most common <b>genetic</b> <b>aberration</b> in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The “core binding factor AML” (CBF AML) classification is the most common group of AML, including groups with the chromosome rearrangements inv(16)(p13q22) and t(8;21)(q22;q22). The chromosome translocation t(8;21)(q22;q22) creates the RUNX1-ETO fusion gene, which is expressed in FAB subtype M2 AML samples. The pericentric chromosome inversion inv(16)(p13q22) creates the CBFB-MYH11 fusion gene, which encodes the CBFβ-SMMHC fusion protein ...|$|E
5000|$|In genetics, a {{deletion}} (also called gene deletion, deficiency, or deletion mutation) (sign: Δ) is a mutation (a <b>genetic</b> <b>aberration)</b> {{in which}} {{a part of a}} chromosome or a sequence of DNA is lost during DNA replication. Any number of nucleotides can be deleted, from a single base to an entire piece of chromosome. [...] The smallest single base deletion mutations are believed to occur by a single base flipping in the template DNA, followed by template DNA strand slippage, within the DNA polymerase active site. Deletions can be caused by errors in chromosomal crossover during meiosis, which causes several serious genetic diseases. Deletions that do not occur in multiples of three bases can cause a frameshift by changing the 3-nucleotide protein reading frame of the genetic sequence. The examples given below of types and effects of deletions are representative of eukaryotic organisms, particularly humans, but are not relevant to prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria.|$|E
40|$|In {{the search}} of new drugs to treat cancer patients, many {{targeted}} therapies are being developed. Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) {{are one of the}} many molecules that are currently under investigation for their potential as a drug target in breast cancer patients. These receptor tyrosine kinases {{play a major role in}} several processes including proliferation, angiogenesis, and migration. Alterations in these basal processes can contribute to the development and progression of tumors. In breast cancer patients, several subgroups of patients have been identified to harbor <b>genetic</b> <b>aberrations</b> in FGFRs. These <b>genetic</b> <b>aberrations</b> include amplifications of FGFR 1, - 2 and - 4, and mutations in FGFR 2 and - 4. Multiple in vitro and in vivo models have partly elucidated the molecular implications of these different <b>genetic</b> <b>aberrations</b> on the characteristics of the tumors. Based on these results several drug targets have been suggested. For some of these targets drugs have already been developed, which are currently being tested in in vitro and in vivo settings. Future experiments will have to be performed in order to further clarify the molecular implications of the <b>genetic</b> <b>aberrations,</b> to develop and test drugs but also to identify the subgroup of patients that will benefit from these newly developed therapies...|$|R

Due to these multiple <b>genetic</b> <b>aberrations,</b> e. g. chromosomal deletions, duplications and translocations and gene mutations, cancer {{is a very complex}} disease. If no appropriate therapy can be given, cancer will eventually lead to death of the inflicted patient. However, the genetic malformations cause the tumor cell to differ from the surrounding normal cells and this difference can be used to develop tumor specific therapy. [...] . Zie: Summary...|$|R
40|$|Unstable <b>genetic</b> <b>aberrations</b> {{might provide}} a good marker for {{assessing}} genetic damage in populations exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation. The frequency of these aberrations was estimated in peripheral lymphocytes from hospital workers in Bushehr Port, occupationally exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation (54 subjects) and age and sex matched controls. A total of 34 (23 males & 11 females) subjects had unstable <b>genetic</b> <b>aberrations</b> (50 chromosomal-type & 31 chromatid type) but only 7 subjects in control group had unstable <b>genetic</b> <b>aberrations.</b> When compared with controls, exposed workers showed {{a significant increase in}} structural chromosomal-type aberrations (p< 0. 001 OR= 11) chromosomal exchange being the most frequent alteration.

5000|$|For {{the past}} fifteen years the forest {{officials}} and inhabitants of the Agasthyakoodam region have always heard Kani tribals talking about Kallanas, but there were never any confirmed sightings. Recently Sali Palode, a Kerala-based wildlife photographer, and Mallan Kani, a member of Kerala’s Kani tribe, who were in search of this elusive elephant were able to photograph one such dwarf elephant, and even claim to have seen a herd. On 17 March 2010, the same Mallan Kani guided the photographer Ajanta Benny to a Kallana and he took pictures. This was reported in the Malayalam daily Malayala Manorama with a picture (The report and picture can be seen at [...] ). But one needs to be captured and tested to see whether it is a separate species. In any case, the effort of Sali Palode and the Mallan Kani will herald a new vigour to ascertain the truth, by detailed research. The Kerala Forest Department has recently deputed search teams to the forests of Agasthyavanam, Neyyar and the Peppara Wildlife Sanctuaries to search for the pygmy elephants.A new video footage by Sali Palode and Dr Kamaruddheen attained media attention as well as government officials in studying about this, to confirm whether this is a new species. Some of the criticisms from experts is that all the sightings have been of solitary animal. So this could be a sign of <b>genetic</b> <b>aberration</b> rather than a separate species. In 2013, a dwarf individual belonging to Elephas maximus was observed in Udawalawe National Park in southern Sri Lanka and scientifically documented.|$|E
