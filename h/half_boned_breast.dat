40|$|Abstract Background Bone metastases are {{frequent}} complications of breast cancer. Recent literature implicates multiple chemokines {{in the formation}} of <b>bone</b> metastases in <b>breast</b> cancer. However, the molecular mechanism of metastatic <b>bone</b> disease in <b>breast</b> cancer remains unknown. We have recently made the novel observation of the BST 2 protein expression in human breast cancer cell lines. The purpose of our present study is to investigate the expression and the role of BST 2 in <b>bone</b> metastatic <b>breast</b> cancer. Methods cDNA microarray analysis was used to compare the BST 2 gene expression between a metastatic to <b>bone</b> human <b>breast</b> cancer cell line (MDA- 231 BO) and a primary human breast cancer cell line (MDA- 231). The BST 2 expression in one <b>bone</b> metastatic <b>breast</b> cancer and seven non-bone metastatic breast cancer cell lines were also determined using real-time RT-PCR and Western blot assays. We then employed tissue array to further study the BST 2 expression in human breast cancer using array slides containing 20 independent breast cancer tumors that formed metastatic bone lesions, 30 non-metastasis-forming breast cancer tumors, and 8 normal breast tissues. In order to test the feasibility of utilizing BST 2 as a serum marker for the presence of <b>bone</b> metastasis in <b>breast</b> cancer, we had measured the BST 2 expression levels in human serums by using ELISA on 43 breast cancer patients with <b>bone</b> metastasis, 43 <b>breast</b> cancer patients without bone metastasis, and 14 normal healthy controls. The relationship between cell migration and proliferation and BST 2 expression was also studied in a human breast recombinant model system using migration and FACS analysis. Results The microarray demonstrated over expression of the BST 2 gene in the <b>bone</b> metastatic <b>breast</b> cancer cell line (MDA- 231 BO) compared to the primary human breast cancer cell line (MDA- 231). The expression of the BST 2 gene was significantly increased in the <b>bone</b> metastatic <b>breast</b> cancer cell lines and tumor tissues compared to non-bone metastatic breast cancer cell lines and tumor tissues by real time RT-PCR, Western blot and TMA. Furthermore, serum levels of BST 2 measured by ELISA were also significantly higher among patients with breast cancer metastatic to <b>bone</b> compared to <b>breast</b> cancer patients without metastatic to bone (P Conclusion These results provide novel data indicating the BST 2 protein expression is associated with the formation of bone metastases in human breast cancer. We believe that BST 2 may be a potential biomarker in <b>breast</b> cancer with <b>bone</b> metastasis. </p...|$|R

Data for this study came from 224 chickens raised during three different seasons, namely spring (n= 66), summer (n= 66), winter (n= 92). Second week body weight, shank length, shank width, <b>breast</b> <b>bone</b> length, <b>breast</b> width, breast circumference and body length were used to predict the slaughter weight. Results of RTA showed that among the seven independent variables only four were selected, namely; body weight, <b>breast</b> <b>bone</b> length, shank width, and breast circumference.

40|$|The {{skeleton}} is {{a preferred}} {{site of metastasis}} in patients with disseminated breast cancer. We have used 4 T 1 mouse mammary carcinoma cells, which metastasize to bone from the mammary fat pads of immunocompetent mice, to identify novel genes involved in this process. In vivo selection of parental cells resulted in the isolation of independent, aggressively <b>bone</b> metastatic <b>breast</b> cancer populations with reduced metastasis to the lung. Gene expression profiling identified osteoactivin as a candidate that is highly and selectively expressed in aggressively <b>bone</b> metastatic <b>breast</b> cancer cells. These cells displayed enhanced migratory and invasive characteristics in vitro, the latter requiring sustained osteoactivin expression. Osteoactivin depletion in these cells, by small interfering RNA, also lead {{to a loss of}} matrix metalloproteinase- 3 expression, whereas forced osteoactivin expression in parental 4 T 1 cells was sufficient to elevate matrix metalloproteinase- 3 levels, suggesting that this matrix metalloproteinase may be an important mediator of osteoactivin function. Overexpression of osteoactivin in an independent, weakly <b>bone</b> metastatic <b>breast</b> cancer cell model significantly enhanced the formation of osteolytic bone metastases in vivo. Finally, high levels of osteoactivin expression in primary human breast cancers correlate with estrogen receptor–negative status and increasing tumor grade.

Methods: Peripheral blood of ten <b>bone</b> metastatic <b>breast</b> cancer patients was collected for serum insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 expression detection just before and 2 days after PA infusion. Results: Both IGF- 1 and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 concentrations decreased after PA treatment for 48 hours (P 20 % decrease recorded 2 days after PA administration. The decrease of IGF- 1 was more significant in breast cancer patients who had received previous hormonotherapy. Moreover, the progression-free survival of first-line chemotherapy treatment of IGF- 1 modified patients was longer than that of IGF- 1 unmodified patients (P= 0. 009).
