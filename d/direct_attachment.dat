25|$|An {{alternative}} view is {{that the}} patches are moved {{to the rear of the}} cell by <b>direct</b> <b>attachment</b> to the actin cytoskeleton. The molecular mechanism for how this could be achieved is unclear, since, when glycolipids or GPI-bound proteins (in the outer monolayer of the cell's surface bilayer) are crosslinked, they cap, just like any surface protein. As these molecules cannot themselves interact directly with the cytoplasmic actin cytoskeleton, this scheme seems unlikely.|$|E
25|$|Though {{there is}} {{evidence}} that ocular implants have been around for thousands of years modern nonintegrated spherical intraconal implants came into existence around 1976 (not just glass eyes). Nonintegrated implants contain no unique apparatus for attachments to the extraocular muscles and do not allow in-growth of organic tissue into their inorganic substance. Such implants have no <b>direct</b> <b>attachment</b> to the ocular prosthesis. Usually, these implants are covered with a material that permits ﬁxation of the extraocular recti muscles, such as donor sclera or polyester gauze which improves implant motility, but does not allow for direct mechanical coupling between the implant and the artiﬁcial eye.|$|E
25|$|A lot {{of effort}} has been put into {{controlling}} cell selectivity.

Other mechanisms like the introduction of D-amino acids and fluorinated amino acids in the hydrophobic phase are believed to break the secondary structure and thus reduce hydrophobic interaction with mammalian cells.

500|$|Bowlby's {{original}} {{account of}} a sensitivity period during which attachments can form of between six months and {{two to three years}} has been modified by later researchers. These researchers have shown that there is indeed a sensitive period during which attachments will form if possible, but the time frame is broader and the effect less fixed and irreversible than first proposed. With further research, authors discussing attachment theory have come to appreciate that social development is affected by later as well as earlier relationships. Early steps in attachment take place most easily if the infant has one caregiver, or the occasional care of a small number of other people. According to Bowlby, almost from the first many children have more than one figure toward whom they <b>direct</b> <b>attachment</b> behaviour. These figures are not treated alike; there is a strong bias for a child to <b>direct</b> <b>attachment</b> behaviour mainly toward one particular person. Bowlby used the term [...] "monotropy" [...] to describe this bias. Researchers and theorists have abandoned this concept insofar as it may be taken to mean that the relationship with the special figure differs qualitatively from that of other figures. Rather, current thinking postulates definite hierarchies of relationships.|$|E
500|$|Some infants <b>direct</b> <b>attachment</b> {{behaviour}} (proximity seeking) {{toward more}} than one attachment figure {{almost as soon as}} they start to show discrimination between caregivers; most come to do so during their second year. These figures are arranged hierarchically, with the principal attachment figure at the top. The set-goal of the attachment behavioural system is to maintain the accessibility and availability of the attachment figure. [...] "Alarm" [...] is the term used for activation of the attachment behavioural system caused by fear of danger. [...] "Anxiety" [...] is the anticipation or fear of being cut off from the attachment figure. If the figure is unavailable or unresponsive, separation distress occurs. In infants, physical separation can cause anxiety and anger, followed by sadness and despair. By age three or four, physical separation is no longer such a threat to the child's bond with the attachment figure. Threats to security in older children and adults arise from prolonged absence, breakdowns in communication, emotional unavailability, or signs of rejection or abandonment.|$|E

40|$|<b>Direct</b> {{skeletal}} <b>attachments</b> for transfemoral amputees {{have been}} the subject of clinical trials since the early nineties. This method of attachment allows the amputee an unrestricted range of motion around the hip joint, better sitting comfort, improved sensory feedback through osseoperception, improved limb control and reduced soft tissue problems. However, the length of the rehabilitation period is perceived as a shortcoming by the amputees and the clinicians. The aim of the present study is to estimate the risk of failure during gait, for a patient with <b>direct</b> skeletal <b>attachment</b> of a femoral prosthesis, using ﬁnite element analysis (FEA). Material properties and loads were derived from subject-speciﬁc data and implant stability assumed secured by bone ingrowth into a porous implant surface. A simpliﬁed FEA was used to optimize the implant geometry with respect to load bearing capacity. The resulting geometry was then implemented in a subject-speciﬁc FE study. The results indicate that the risk of failure for the implant system is approximately three times greater than what can be expected for an intact femur. The main conclusion, based on the risk of failure factors calculated, is that it is likely that a porous-coated implant could be beneﬁcial for osseointegrated ﬁxation. It is also suggested that the proposed methodology can be used in future studies exploring the mechanical stability of osseointegrated ﬁxation in the view of improving <b>direct</b> skeletal <b>attachments</b> for lower limb amputees. ...|$|R

40|$|Magister Scientiae Dentium - MSc(Dent) Introduction: Micro-leakage and enamel {{demineralization}} {{is still}} a major challenge in dental practice. It can lead to formation of demineralization lesions around and beneath the adhesive–enamel interface (Mali et al., 2006). Enamel demineralization adjacent to orthodontic brackets {{is one of the}} risks associated with orthodontic treatment. The prevention of demineralization during orthodontic treatment is therefore essential for aesthetic reasons and to circumvent the onset of caries. Aim: To assess micro-leakage and enamel demineralization around orthodontic <b>direct</b> <b>attachments</b> (brackets) using three different orthodontic cements. Materials and methods: In this in-vitro study, intact (non carious) extracted human premolars were used to compare the micro-leakage and enamel demineralization of three different cements (Fuji Ortho LC, Rely X luting 2 and Transbond XT). The dye penetration technique was used to evaluate micro-leakage on extracted human premolars. Micro-hardness testing was performed on 21 teeth to determine enamel demineralization. Sixty teeth were randomly divided into 3 groups of twenty teeth each. <b>Direct</b> <b>attachments</b> were cemented on each tooth using 3 different cements; Fuji Ortho LC (GC Fuji II LC GC Corporation Tokyo, Japan), (group 1), Rely X luting 2 cement (3 M ESPE dental product, USA), (group 2), Transbond XT Light Cure (3 M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif), (group 3). After the orthodontic <b>direct</b> <b>attachments</b> were fitted, they were exposed to 500 thermo-cycles between 5 °C and 55 °C, with a dwell time of 15 seconds in a buffered (pH 7) 1 % methylene blue dye solution (Grobler et al, 2007). The specimens were viewed under a stereomicroscope (Nikon, Japan) at magnification of 40 times. Photographs of each specimen were taken with a Leica camera (Leica DFC 290 micro-systems, Germany) fitted onto a stereomicroscope. The ACDsee photo editing programme was used to transfer the photographs to a computer to measure the dye penetration along the enamel–adhesive and adhesive–bracket interfaces, both on the gingival and occlusal edge at × 40 magnification. For the demineralization sample, 21 teeth were divided into 3 groups of seven teeth each, where <b>direct</b> <b>attachments</b> were cemented using each of the 3 cements, group 1, Fuji Ortho LC (GC Fuji II LC GC Corporation Tokyo, Japan); group 2, Rely X luting 2 cement (3 M ESPE dental product, USA) and group 3, Transbond XT Light Cure (3 M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif). A digital hardness tester with Vickers diamond indenter (Zwick RoellIndentec (ZHV; Indentec UK) was used to measure surface micro-hardness of enamel before and after attaching the brackets. Ten indentations were made on the enamel surface of each tooth before bonding the brackets with a 300 g load applied for 15 seconds to establish the baseline hardness value. After de-bonding the brackets, the hardness was measured again in the same area as mentioned above to determine the degree of enamel demineralization (softening). Result: The result showed statistically significantly lower levels of micro-leakage for Transbond XT (P= < 0. 001). The amount of micro-leakage on the margins was significantly higher in the gingival portion (P < 0. 05) as compared with the occlusal margin. Enamel micro-hardness tests before bonding using the three different cements showed that the variances are not significantly different (Chi-squared = 3. 051, df = 2, p-value = 0. 218). However, the micro-hardness tests done after bonding and thermo-cycling was statistically significantly different (Chi-squared = 13. 435, df = 2, p-value = 0. 001). Clearly, the Transbond XT group had less hardness, implying greater demineralization than the Fuji Ortho LC and Rely X luting 2 groups. Two sample t-tests show that mean value for the Fuji Ortho and Rely X luting 2 were not significantly different from each other (t = - 0. 636, df = 12, p-value = 0. 537). The mean value for Transbond XT differed significantly from both the other two means: Transbond XT vs Fuji Ortho LC (t = 3. 249, df = 6. 9, p-value = 0. 014). Transbond XT vs Rely X luting 2 (t = 3. 493, df = 6. 8, p-value = 0. 011). Conclusions: This study showed that Fuji Ortho LC and Rely X luting 2 show more micro-leakage than Transbond XT. However Transbond XT had significant lower micro-leakage, less hardness (greater demineralization) than the Fuji Ortho LC and Rely X luting 2. This may have been due to the fluoride release which significantly reduces demineralization. Therefore the Fuji Ortho LC and Rely X luting 2 may be recommended for prevention of demineralization during orthodontic treatment...|$|R
