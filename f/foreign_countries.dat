40|$|This paper {{builds a}} two-country, two-sector (manufacturing and agriculture), non-scale growth model and investigates the {{relationship}} between trade patterns and {{the growth rate of}} per capita real consumption. If the population growth rate of the home country is higher than that of the <b>foreign</b> <b>country,</b> the following results are obtained. (1) Under autarky, the growth rate of per capita real consumption is higher in the home country than in the <b>foreign</b> <b>country.</b> (2) Under free trade, if the home country completely specializes in manufacturing and the <b>foreign</b> <b>country</b> asymptotically completely specializes in agriculture, then the growth rate of the <b>foreign</b> <b>country</b> is higher than that of the home country, though this trade pattern is not sustainable in the long run. (3) Under free trade, if the home country produces both goods and the <b>foreign</b> <b>country</b> asymptotically completely specializes in agriculture, then the growth rates of the home <b>country</b> and the <b>foreign</b> <b>country</b> are equal, and this trade pattern is sustainable in the long run...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of a responsible multinational firm's decision to enter in a <b>foreign</b> <b>country</b> either through exports or through foreign direct investment (FDI), {{as well as the}} relevant market and societal outcomes.
