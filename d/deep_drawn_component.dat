40|$|Abstract—In the {{automotive}} and aerospace industries, {{the need for}} lightweight products is absolutely necessary. By combining between the strength and lightweight material usingTailor Welded Blank(TWB), the need can be achieved. Aluminium has the tendency to flow more than steel due to the lower density and weaker. Independence blank holder allows the application of different force on steel and aluminium in the forming process. The blank sheet flow can be controlled by different blank holder force (BHF). The promising materials are Steel and Aluminium alloy thatare formed into single blank sheet. The purpose of this numerical study is to demonstrate that dissimilar strength Steel-Al TWB can be subjected to <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> operations successfully, using optimum process parameters in the Finite Element (FE) simulation.

40|$|Abstract. Trends in the {{automotive}} industry tend towards safety, fuel saving and reduction of exhaust gas result in an increased application of high strength steels as well as stainless steels in the car body production. <b>Deep</b> <b>drawing</b> is a tension/compression forming process of a sheet metal blank to a hollow part without a volitional thickness changing. This permanent deformation occurs when the applied stress exceeds the elastic limit of the material. The elastic deformation within the overall amount of deformation is not desired and leads to the so called spring back, which {{is directly related to}} the materials strength, sheet thickness and Young’s modulus. Besides strength and elastic modulus there are more factors affecting the part quality or the spring back behavior of <b>deep</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>components.</b> This paper will cover the effect of relevant forming parameters, as there are the die radius, the height of the beads and the drawing clearance.

In the present work, analysis has been carried out by dividing the total deformation region into several zones. Analysis of each zone is carried out by proposing kinematically admissible velocity field, i. e. the velocity field satisfying the condition of normal velocity continuity and volume constancy. The input material (already drawn cup) for redrawing is pre-strained from the previous stage drawing operation and this has been considered while carrying out the analysis.

The optimal blank shape, that will result in earing free cup after the final drawing operation, has been determined. For the prediction of optimal blank shape for multistage <b>deep</b> <b>drawing,</b> addition-subtraction scheme has been developed and successfully implemented; the modification of the initial blank is done after each stage of drawing.

According to the semi-ball bottom cylindrical <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> features, the stress conditions of the sheet in different regions have been analyzed by a mathematical modelling. In addition, the effects of processing parameters on the forming limit of the sheet in semi-ball bottom cylindrical <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> have been investigated by experimental method and simulation based on dynaform, respectively. It is found that the experimental results are consistent to that in simulation and the results show that the formability of the sheet is influenced greatly by the blank holder force, friction coefficient and thickness. With the blank holder force and friction coefficient decreasing and the thickness increasing, the bulging area can be expanded, which is beneficial to the improvement of the forming limit height of the semi-ball bottom cylindrical <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> parts...|$|R
