For lower bound states, {{agreement between the}} results in this paper and previous work is quite satisfactory; while for high lying bound states and resonances these are the first reported results. A helicity quantum number V assignment (within the helicity conserving approximation) is performed and {{the results indicate that}} for lower bound states it is possible to assign the V quantum numbers unambiguously, but for resonances it is impossible to assign the V helicity quantum numbers due to strong mixing. In fact, for the high-lying bound states, the mixing has already appeared. These results indicate that the helicity conserving approximation is not good for the resonance state calculations and exact quantum calculations are needed to accurately describe the reaction dynamics for HO 2 system. Analysis of the resonance widths shows that most of the resonances are overlapping and the interferences between them lead to large fluctuations from one resonance to another.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in wide-angle imaging of the environment using curved reflective surfaces. With this comes the need for appropriate filtering and processing of the acquired images. Here we present a technique for <b>homogeneous,</b> fast <b>filtering</b> of panoramic images captured using a camera and a wide-angle-imaging reflective surface. Imaging of the panoramic environment onto a two-dimensional (2 -D) plane necessarily introduces spatial distortions such as stretching and bending that vary with the viewing direction. Therefore, if the panoramic image is to be filtered homogeneously in all viewing directions, {{it is necessary to}} match the filtering to the distortions. We show how this can be accomplished. The image acquired by the camera is first digitally unwarped and represented in Cartesian coordinates representing azimuth and elevation. The mappings of patches of uniform size and shape on the viewsphere are then established. Next, for each filter patch the local mappings of great circles along two principal axes (along the local longitudinal and elevational directions) on the image plane are determined. The mappings of these great circles are used to perform the 2 -D convolution required by the filtering operation. Convolution along the directions of local, mutually orthogonal great circles permits the filtering to be carried out in a quasi-separable fashion, resulting in increased computational speed and efficiency.

40|$|Cake {{filtration}} is a {{unit operation}} to separate solids from fluids in industrial processes. The build up of a filter cake is usually accompanied with {{a decrease in}} overall permeability over the filter leading to an increased pressure drop over the filter. For an incompressible filter cake that builds up on a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>filter</b> cloth, a linear pressure drop profile over time is expected for a constant fluid volume flow. However, experiments show curved pressure drop profiles, which are also attributed to inhomogeneities of the filter (filter medium and/or residual filter cake). In this work, a mathematical filter model is developed to describe the relationship between time and overall permeability. The model considers a filter with an inhomogeneous permeability and accounts for fluid mechanics by a one-dimensional formulation of Darcy's law and for the cake build up by solid continuity. The model can be solved analytically in the time domain. The analytic solution allows for the unambiguous inversion of the model to determine the inhomogeneous permeability from the time resolved overall permeability, e. g. pressure drop measurements. An error estimation of the method is provided by rewriting the model as convolution transformation. This method is applied to simulated and experimental pressure drop data of gas filters with textile filter cloths and various situations with non-uniform flow situations in practical problems are explored. A routine is developed to generate characteristic filter cycles from semi-continuous filter plant operation. The model is modified to investigate the impact of non-uniform dust concentrations.

Knowledge relating to microbial fate in {{this zone is}} therefore important for increased understanding of groundwater vulnerability. This thesis examines the published literature that {{is related to the}} transport, retention and survival processes that apply to the fecal indicator bacterium Escherichia coli in unsaturated porous media. The main focus concerns the research findings under steady-state flow in <b>homogeneous</b> <b>filter</b> media, and under unfavorable attachment conditions, which are the most common in the natural environment. Experimental results in the literature for the pore-, column- and field-scale are examined and compared to commonly applied theories and modeling approaches. An analysis of the main factors that influence attenuation and biofilm formation is provided. Further, the findings are illustrated in a model of an unplanted, vertical flow constructed wetland. The results indicate that retention at the solid-air-water interface is a major attenuation process. In addition, they suggest that the flow velocity (as dependent on the grain size and the saturation) is a key influencing factor. However, it has not yet been established how the research findings relating to the main processes and influencing factors can be incorporated into predictive models; in the literature, a multitude of models have been proposed and alternative theories could describe the same observation. In this study, the transport and fate of Escherichia coli in different sand filters is, therefore, modeled using various literature models - derived under similar experimental conditions - in order to assess the possibility to compare and generalize the equations, evaluate their implications considering the different saturation settings and filter depths, and to define the spectra of the reduction efficiencies. It is discovered that the bacterial attenuation behaviors vary largely. This calls for clarification regarding the underlying processes.

40|$|Abstract — In {{the last}} decade, {{illumination}} {{problem has been}} the bottleneck of robust face recognition system. Extracting illumination invariant features {{becomes more and more}} sig-nificant to solve this issue. However, existing works in this field only consider the variations caused by lighting direction or magnitude (denoted as homogeneous lighting), while the spectral wavelength is always ignored in most of the developed illumination invariant descriptors. In this paper, we claim that the spectral wavelength is important, and we propose a novel gradient based descriptor, namely Logarithm Gradient Histogram (LGH), which takes the illumination direction, magnitude and even the spectral wavelength together into consideration (denoted as heterogeneous lighting). Our proposal contributes in the following three-folds: (1) we incorporate <b>homogeneous</b> <b>filtering</b> to alleviate the illumination effect for each image and extract two illumination invariant components, namely logarithm gradient orientation (LGO) and logarith-m gradient magnitude (LGM); (2) we propose an effective postprocessing strategy to guarantee the fault-tolerant ability and generate a histogram representation to integrate both LGO and LGM; (3) we present thorough theoretical analysis on the illumination invariant properties for our proposed method.

Generally, they are placed on the network perimeter and are used to separate the intranet from the Internet. Firewalls are used to forbid some protocols, to shape the bandwidth resources, and to perform deep packet inspection in order to spot malicious or unauthorized contents passing through the network. In a wireless multihop network, the concept of perimeter is hard to identify and the firewall function must be implemented on every node together with routing. But when the network size grows, the rule-set used to configure the firewall may grow accordingly and introduce latencies and instabilities for the low-power mesh nodes. We propose a novel concept of firewall in which every node filters the traffic only with {{a portion of the}} whole rule-set in order to reduce its computational burden. Even if at each hop we commit some errors, we show that the filtering efficiency measured for the whole network can achieve the desired precision, with a positive effect on the available network resources. This approach is different from the protection of a space behind a wall: we use the term waterwall to indicate a distributed and <b>homogeneous</b> <b>filtering</b> function spread among all the nodes in the network.|$|R
40|$|Background-error variances {{estimated}} from a small-size {{ensemble of}} data assimilations {{need to be}} filtered because of the associated sampling noise. Previous studies showed that objective spectral filtering is efficient in reducing this noise, while preserving relevant features to a large extent. However, since such <b>filters</b> are <b>homogeneous,</b> they tend to smooth small-scale structures of interest. In many applications, nonlinear thresholding of wavelet coefficients {{has proved to be}} an efficient technique for denoising signals. This algorithm proceeds by thresholding the wavelet coefficients of the noisy signal using an estimated threshold. This is equivalent to applying an adaptive local spatial filtering. A quasi-optimal value for the threshold can be computed from the noise variance. We show that the statistical properties of the sampling noise associated with the estimation of background-error variances can be used to calculate the noise level and the appropriate threshold value. This method is first applied to 1 D academic examples, with emphasis on correlated and heterogeneous noises. This approach is shown to outperform the commonly used <b>homogeneous</b> <b>filters,</b> since it automatically adapts to the local structure of the signal. We also show that this technique compares favourably to a heterogeneous diffusion-based filter, with the advantage of requiring less trial-and-error tuning.

The healthy gut held a more clustered phylogenetic community than the diseased one (Fig.  1 a), which suggests that the health state exerts a stronger filtering on the gut assemblages than other factors (Stephens et al. 2016; Zhou and [...] Ning 2017). And the concurrent changes in richness and phylogenetic diversity revealed that the missing species resulting from disease occurrence were phylogenetically clustered (Fig.  1 a and Additional file 1 : Figure S 2). Furthermore, healthy shrimp exerts homogeneous selection on exogenous colonizers (Fig.  1 b), thus contributing to similar community compositions (Fig.  1 a) (Martınez et al. 2015). This was supported by the view that deterministic processes drive the assembly of the gut bacterial community of healthy aquatic animals (e.g. fish and shrimp) (Burns et al. 2016; Xiong et al. 2017; Yan et al. 2016). On the contrary, the ecological process governing the diseased shrimp transit with the disease onset time, from <b>homogeneous</b> <b>filtering</b> to heterogeneous, and then to stochastic process (Fig.  1 b).

Advantages to take into account in our filtering method are the prevention/avoidance of spatiotemporal blur; one should only consider neighboring pixels from the current frame in case of detected motion. Other advantage is in preserving the details in the frame content; the filtering should not be as strong when large spatial activity e.g., a large variance, is detected in the current filtering window.
