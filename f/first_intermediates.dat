Here, we demonstrate the formation of self-limiting monodisperse gold SPs with core–shell morphology based on {{the building blocks of}} flexible nanoarms in one step. A flow-based microfluidic chip is utilized to slow down the assembly process of the intermediates, which surprisingly allows for observation of ultrathin gold nanoplates as <b>first</b> <b>intermediates.</b> Notably, these intermediate cannot be observed in traditional synthesis due to their rapid rolling-up to form the second-order nanostructure of flexible hollow nanoarms.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that fosmidomycin, risedronate, and {{nerolidol}} exert antimalarial activity in vitro. We included squalestatin, an inhibitor of the isoprenoid metabolism in Erwinia uredovora, and found that combinations of compounds which act on different targets of the plasmodial isoprenoid pathway possess important supra-additivity effects. Malaria expansion in some areas has been attributed to thefailure of vector-control policies and,mainly, to the increase of parasite resistance to drugs commonly used for its therapy (1). This alarming scenario has fuelled research in new antimalarial drugs, and, with the sequencing of parasite genomes, new poten-tial drug targets have emerged. Burrows et al. published a review discussing the strategies for designing the next generation ofmed-icines for malaria control (2). A metabolic pathway that may be a likely target for evaluating potential antimalarials is the isoprenoid pathway. The <b>first</b> <b>intermediates</b> are biosynthesized in the apico-plast, which is an organelle present in protozoan parasites of the subphylum Apicomplexa, including Plasmodia (3).

40|$|The enzymatic {{reaction}} between DOPA and tyrosinase, {{the enzyme}} {{considered to be}} responsible for melanogenesis, was carried out in the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG). This choice was made in order to increase the solubility of melanins, since these polymers are highly insoluble. The reaction mixtures were sampled at different times, immediately ultrafiltered to remove the enzyme, lyophilized, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. The results were very different from those obtained in the absence of PEG. Only a few oligomers of dihydroxyindole (DHI) and dihydroxyindole- 2 -carboxylic acid (DHICA) were detected in low abundances, whereas new species originating from reaction of PEG with species belonging to the Raper-Mason pattern appeared. The results show that, in the presence of PEG, tyrosinase-catalyzed oligomerization of DOPA exhibits kinetics slower than those observed {{in the absence of the}} polymer. However, melanogenesis still takes place in the presence of PEG, as indicated by the formation of black pigments and by the detection of DHI and DHICA oligomers, considered to be the <b>first</b> <b>intermediates</b> in melanin formation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Electron Spectrometer (ELS), one of {{the sensors}} making up the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) {{revealed}} the existence of numerous negative ions in Titan's upper atmosphere. The observations at closest approach (not, vert, similar 1000 km) show evidence for negatively charged ions up to not, vert, similar 10, 000 amu/q, {{as well as two}} distinct peaks at 22 ± 4 and 44 ± 8 amu/q, and maybe a third one at 82 ± 14 amu/q. We present the first ionospheric model of Titan including negative ion chemistry. We find that dissociative electron attachment to neutral molecules (mostly HCN) initiates the formation of negative ions. The negative charge is then transferred to more acidic molecules such as HC 3 N, HC 5 N or C 4 H 2. Loss occurs through associative detachment with radicals (H and CH 3). We attribute the three low mass peaks observed by ELS to CN−, C 3 N−/C 4 H− and C 5 N−. These species are the <b>first</b> <b>intermediates</b> {{in the formation of the}} even larger negative ions observed by ELS, which are most likely the precursors to the aerosols observed at lower altitudes...|$|E
40|$|Biosynthetic {{studies using}} both [14 C]- and [32 P]-labelled {{substrates}} and a cell-free system to synthesise 1 -O-alkyl moieties in glycerolipids, {{have shown that}} the three initial steps in ether-lipid biosynthesis in Leishmania mexicana promastigotes resemble those described for mammals and are associated with glycosomes. Purified glycosomes were able to sequentially synthesise the <b>first</b> <b>intermediates</b> of the ether-lipid biosynthetic pathway [acyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate (DHAP), alkyl-DHAP and acyl/alkyl-glycerol- 3 -phosphate (G 3 P) ] when incubated in the presence of radiolabelled DHAP, palmitoyl-CoA, hexadecanol and NADPH. However, when glycosomes were incubated under the same conditions in the presence of radiolabelled G 3 P, a rapid synthesis of acyl-G 3 P and phosphatidic acid was observed without any formation of alkyl-G 3 P, suggesting that the enzyme alkyl-synthase recognises only acyl-DHAP as substrate. Both the DHAP acyltransferase (DHAP-AT) and alkyl-DHAP synthase activities were located inside glycosomes whereas the alkyl/acyl-DHAP oxidoreductase activity was associated with the cytoplasmic face of the glycosomal membrane. The G 3 P acyltransferase (G 3 P-AT) and lyso-phosphatidic acid acyltransferase activities were not found inside glycosomes. The results suggest that the DHAP-AT and G 3 P-AT activities are catalysed by two distinct enzymes associated with different sub-cellular compartments...|$|E

40|$|AbstractParameters that {{influence}} the zero valent iron mediated degradation of the pharmaceutical diazepam (DZP) were evaluated including the iron concentration and its pre-treatment, the effect of complexation with EDTA and oxic versus anoxic condition. It was observed that acid pre-treatment of iron particles is important for degradation efficiency and that H 2 SO 4 is a better choice than HCl, resulting in higher degradation of DZP. Under oxic conditions, the degradation of DZP achieved 96 % after 60 min using Fe 0 (25 gL− 1) pre-treated with H 2 SO 4 {{in the presence of}} EDTA (119 mgL− 1), while mineralization achieved around 60 % after the same time. Under anoxic conditions, degradation occurred, however at lower extent, achieving 67 % after 120 min. The addition of EDTA improved the treatment efficiency in 20 % leading to 99 % DZP degradation after 120 min. The <b>first</b> <b>intermediates</b> formed during DZP degradation were identified using LC/MS analysis and revealed the formation of mono- and di-hydroxylated products from DZP during Fe 0 /EDTA/O 2 degradation, which evidences that OH was the main oxidizing species formed in this process...|$|E
40|$|A general {{synthesis}} for bridged bicyclic disulfide compounds was {{refined and}} expanded from (3. 2. 1) to (4. 2. 1) and (2. 2. 1) systems. Various derivatives were synthesized through {{modification of the}} hydroxyl functionality in these molecules. The oxidation of all bridged bicyclic disulfide compounds to their corresponding bridged bicyclic thiosulfinate esters (a previously unknown class of compounds) was performed. Three crystal structures were obtained and selected bond lengths, bond angles and torsion angles were compared with the calculated values obtained using MMX molecular mechanics via the PCMODEL program. The m-CPBA oxidation of the above bridged bicyclic thiosulfinate esters was followed at low temperature using $ sp 1 $H and $ sp{ 13 }$C NMR spectroscopy. $ alpha$-Disulfoxides were detected as the <b>first</b> <b>intermediates</b> in this oxidation process and were seen at temperatures and concentrations greater than any previously reported. Strong evidence was also found to suggest the intermediacy of O,S-sulfenyl sulfinates. A clear mechanistic proposal for the rearrangement of bridged bicyclic $ alpha$-disulfoxides to their corresponding thiosulfonate esters was presented based on experimental results. Attempts towards the synthesis of the bridged bicyclic disulfide analogue of ergosterol peroxide using diatomic sulfur methodologies were reported. These attempts were not successful. The generation of the pseudo-diatomic species, R-P = S (thioxophosphanes), using a methodology previously developed in our laboratory was examined. The thioxophosphanes (R = C$ sb 6 $H$ sb 5 $, C$ sb 2 $H$ sb 5 $ and p-Cl-C$ sb 6 $H$ sb 4 $) were trapped with 1, 3 -dienes to give cyclic and bridged bicyclic thiophosphoranes...|$|E
40|$|The photocycle of the photoactive yellow protein (PYP) {{isolated}} from Ectothiorhodospira halophila was analyzed by flash photolysis with absorption detection at low excitation photon densities and by temperature-dependent laser-induced optoacoustic spectroscopy (LIOAS). The quantum yield for the bleaching recovery of PYP, {{assumed to be}} identical to that for the phototransformation of PYP (pG), to the red-shifted intermediate, pR, was phi R = 0. 35 +/- 0. 05, {{much lower than the}} value of 0. 64 reported in the literature. With this value and the LIOAS data, an energy content for pR of 120 kJ/mol was obtained, approximately 50 % lower than for excited pG. Concomitant with the photochemical process, a volume contraction of 14 ml/photoconverted mol was observed, comparable with the contraction (11 ml/mol) determined for the bacteriorhodopsin monomer. The contraction in both cases is interpreted to arise from a protein reorganization around a phototransformed chromophore with a dipole moment {{different from that of the}} initial state. The deviations from linearity of the LIOAS data at photon densities > 0. 3 photons per molecule are explained by absorption by pG and pR during the laser pulse duration (i. e., a four-level system, pG, pR, and their respective excited states). The data can be fitted either by a simple saturation process or by a photochromic equilibrium between pG and pR, similar to that established between the parent chromoprotein and the <b>first</b> <b>intermediate(s)</b> in other biological photoreceptors. This nonlinearity has important consequences for the interpretation of the data obtained from in vitro studies with powerful lasers...|$|E

40|$|The lamellar/inverted {{hexagonal}} (L alpha/HII) {{phase transition}} {{can be very}} fast, despite the drastic change in the topology of the lipid/water interfaces. The first structures to form in this transition may be {{similar to those that}} mediate membrane fusion in many lipid systems. To study the transition mechanism and other dynamic phenomena in membrane dispersions, we constructed an apparatus to rapidly trigger the transition and then vitrify the specimens to preserve the structure of transient intermediates. The apparatus applies millisecond-long temperature jumps of variable size to aqueous dispersions of lipids on electron microscope grids at times 9 - 16 ms before specimen vitrification. The vitrified specimens are then examined by cryo-transmission electron microscopy. Dispersions of egg phosphatidylethanolamine completed the transition within 9 ms when superheated by 20 K. Similar transition times have been observed in dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine via time-resolved x-ray diffraction. N-monomethylated dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine dispersions superheated to lesser extent exhibited slower transitions and more complex morphology. The structure of the <b>first</b> <b>intermediates</b> to form in the transition process could not be determined, probably because the intermediates are labile on the time scale of sample cooling and vitrification (< 1 ms) and because of the poor contrast developed by some of these small structures. However, the results are more compatible with a transition mechanism based on "stalk" intermediates than a mechanism involving inverted micellar intermediates. Temperature-jump cryo-transmission electron microscopy should be useful in studying dynamic phenomena in biomembranes, large protein complexes, and other colloidal dispersions. It should be especially helpful in studying the mechanism of protein-induced membrane fusion...|$|E
40|$|Merging two {{evolving}} {{areas in}} synthesis, namely cooperative bimetallics and N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), this study reports {{the isolation of}} the <b>first</b> <b>intermediates</b> of alkali-metal-mediated zincation (AMMZn) of a free NHC and a Zn–NHC complex using sodium zincate [(TMEDA) NaZn(TMP) (tBu) 2] (1) as a metallating reagent. The structural authentication of (THF) 3 Na[:C{[N(2, 6 -iPr 2 C 6 H 3) ] 2 CHCZn(tBu 2) }] (2) and [Na(THF) 6]+[tBu 2 Zn:C{[N(2, 6 -iPr 2 C 6 H 3) ] 2 CHCZn(tBu 2) }]− (4), resulting from the reactions of 1 with unsaturated free NHC IPr (IPr = 1, 3 -bis(2, 6 -di-isopropylphenylimidazole- 2 -ylidene) and NHC complex ZntBu 2 IPr (3) respectively demonstrates that in both cases, this mixed-metal approach can easily facilitate the selective C 4 zincation of the unsaturated backbone of the NHC ligand. Furthermore, the generation of anionic NHC fragments enables dual coordination through their normal (C 2) and abnormal (C 4) positions to the bimetallic system, stabilising the kinetic AMMZn intermediates which normally go undetected and provides new mechanistic insights in to how these mixed-metal reagents operate. In stark contrast to this bimetallic approach when NHC-complex 3 is reacted with a more conventional single-metal base such as tBuLi, the deprotonation of the coordinated carbene is inhibited, favouring instead, co-complexation to give NHC-stabilised [IPr·LiZntBu 3] (5). Showing the potential of 2 to act as a transfer agent of its anionic NHC unit to transition metal complexes, this intermediate reacts with two molar equivalents of [ClAu(PPh 3) ] to afford the novel digold species [ClAu:C{[N(2, 6 -iPr 2 C 6 H 3) ] 2 CHCAu(PPh 3) }] (6) resulting from an unprecedented double transmetallation reaction which involves the simultaneous exchange of both cationic (Na+) and neutral (ZntBu 2) entities on the NHC framework...|$|E
40|$|The major {{structural}} protein of the retrovirus HIV- 1 is called Gag and is {{expressed as a}} 55 kDa poly-protein with six contiguous domains. These are labelled from the N-terminus as MA, CA, SP 1, NC, SP 2 and P 6. There are two distinct assembly steps in the lifecycle of HIV- 1, termed immature and mature assembly, {{both of which are}} essential to the production of infectious viral progeny and are as such potential targets of therapeutic intervention. The immature assembly step involves self-association of, typically, 1000 - 2500 copies of Gag in a nucleic acid-dependent manner, resulting in formation of a spherical capsid immediately below the host cell membrane. The resulting immature, noninfectious virions are released from the cell and the viral protease, PR, hydrolyses Gag into its component domains. MA remains at the membrane and NC remains in complex with the genome, whilst CA reassembles as a mature capsid with a conical shape and 5, 7 - Fullerene geometry. In the immature and mature state, CA forms a lattice in which N-CA is arranged as hexamers linked to one another by C-CA dimerisation, but the exact interfaces and CA conformations are different between the two states. In this thesis, experiments are described which seek to establish how a single protein, CA, can form two distinct lattices, and what the role of NC-nucleic acid interactions are in immature assembly. Several Gag mutants are studied using a combination of NMR spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, electron microscopy and in vitro virus capsid assembly assays. It is shown that the NC domain does not intrinsically effect any modulation of the C-CA domain {{at the level of the}} <b>first</b> <b>intermediates</b> in the assembly pathways, and that nucleic acid is required to link two Gag molecules together in order to promote immature assembly.
