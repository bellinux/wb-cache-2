40|$|Electrical power {{generation}} from a moderate temperature thermal source {{by means of}} direct conversion of infrared radiation is important and highly desirable for energy harvesting from waste heat and micropower applications. Here, we demonstrate direct rectified {{power generation}} from an unbiased large-area nanoantenna-coupled tunnel diode rectifier, called a rectenna. Using a vacuum radiometric measurement technique with irradiation from a temperature-stabilized thermal source, a generated power density of 8 nW/cm$^ 2 $ is observed at a source temperature of 450 C for the unbiased rectenna across an optimized load resistance. The optimized load resistance for the peak power generation for each temperature coincides with the tunnel <b>diode</b> <b>resistance</b> at zero bias and corresponds to the impedance matching condition for a rectifying antenna. Current voltage measurements of a thermally illuminated large-area rectenna show current zero crossing shifts into the second quadrant indicating rectification.

40|$|In this master thesis, the {{operation}} {{model of a}} three-phase MOSFET inverter and the corresponding current waveforms are analyzed. The mathematical expressions of the conduction losses based on the three-phase MOSFET inverter using PWM control method are presented. The algebraic equations are given with the parameters of a MOSFET-diode module, such as the on-state resistance, the body <b>diode</b> <b>resistance</b> and the voltage drop. Moreover, a numerical reference representation of the conduction losses is made to verify the analytical expressions. Numerical analysis is firstly based on the pure sinusoidal reference three-phase voltages. The results of the numerical analysis {{and the results of}} the analytical equations are coherent. A comparison of the MOSFET inverter with reverse conduction characteristics and the assumption without reverse conduction is made. Without reverse conduction, the losses of one power module are higher than the one with reverse conduction at both the high and low current levels.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Presentation date: 1991 - 10 - 01 Alternating-current {{thin-film}} electroluminescent (ACTFEL) {{devices are}} metal-insulator-semiconductorinsulator- metal (MISIM) structures which emit light under high field, pulsed excitation. One aspect of ACTFEL operation {{that is not}} well understood is the aging of such devices with operating time. One of the primary goals of this thesis is to characterize the kinetics of ACTFEL aging and to determine the associated activation energy which is then used as an aid in identifying the physical mechanism responsible for aging. Toward this end a new method, the capacitance-voltage (C-V) technique, for electrical characterization of ACTFEL devices is developed and refined. The threshold voltage,Vth, total capacitance Ctot, and the insulator capacitance, Cthg, {{as well as some}} information about the relative interface state density are available from C-V analysis. SPICE simulation and a discrete ACTFEL model are used to verify and refine the C-V technique. The heart of the SPICE model is the standard ACTFEL circuit model which consists of three capacitors representing the phosphor and two insulator layers and a pair of back-to-back Zener diodes which account for conduction in the phosphor above threshold. Model enhancements are the inclusion of five resistances which account for 1) the resistance of the transparent conducting layer, Rito, 2) and 3) the bulk insulator resistances, R 1 and R 2, 4) the phosphor layer bulk resistance, R, and 5) a <b>diode</b> <b>resistance,</b> Rd, which is in series with the back-to-back Zener diodes and is termed a hot electron resistor since it is associated with the emission of electrons from interface trap states. The refined SPICE equivalent circuit is found to give good agreement with experimental C-V curves and with C-V curves generated using a discrete ACTFEL model which is built using discrete capacitors and Zener diodes. Aging experiments are conducted using the C-V technique to monitor the threshold voltage as a function of aging time over a temperature range of - 50 °C to 80 °C. An incubation period, in which the threshold voltage is constant, occurs for temperatures below 20 °C but no incubation period is observed for temperatures above 20 °C. After the incubation period, if any exists, the threshold voltage increases logarithmically with time to a saturated value which is temperature-dependent; logarithmic and saturated aging are collectively referred to as constituting short-term aging. Short-term aging is characterized by Ctot, C 8, and phosphor threshold voltage which are independent of aging time, rigid shifts in the C-V transition to higher threshold voltages with aging time, and decreases in the conduction and polarization charges with aging time. A kinetic analysis of the variable-temperature ACTFEL aging characteristics results in an activation energy of 0. 2 eV. Such experimental observations lead to a model for ACTFEL aging in which conduction electrons are trapped in deep level, fixed charge states which arise from atomic rearrangement at the interface. This trapped charge reduces the polarization charge with a corresponding increase in the threshold voltage...|$|E

Runtime: 56 : 42 minutesAn optical rectenna – that is, a device that directly converts free‐propagating electromagnetic waves at optical frequencies to d. c. electricity – was first proposed over 40 years ago, yet this concept has not been demonstrated experimentally due to fabrication challenges at the nanoscale. Realizing an optical rectenna requires that an antenna be coupled to a diode that operates on the order of 1 petahertz (switching speed on the order of a femtosecond). Ultralow capacitance, on the order of a few attofarads, enables a diode to operate at these frequencies; and the development of metal‐insulator‐metal tunnel junctions with nanoscale dimensions has emerged as a potential path to diodes with ultralow capacitance, but these structures remain extremely difficult to fabricate and couple to a nanoscale antenna reliably. Here we demonstrate an optical rectenna by engineering metal‐insulator‐metal tunnel diodes, with ultralow junction capacitance of approximately 2 attofarads, at the tips of multiwall carbon nanotubes, which act as the antenna and metallic electron field emitter in the diode. This demonstration is achieved using very small diode areas based on the diameter of a single carbon nanotube (about 10 nanometers), geometric field enhancement at the carbon nanotube tips, and a low work function semi‐transparent top metal contact. Using vertically‐aligned arrays of the diodes, we measure d. c. open‐circuit voltage and short‐circuit current at visible and infrared electromagnetic frequencies that is due to a rectification process, and quantify minor contributions from thermal effects. In contrast to recent reports of photodetection based on hot electron decay in plasmonic nanoscale antenna, a coherent optical antenna field is rectified directly in our devices, consistent with rectenna theory. Our devices show evidence of photon‐assisted tunneling that reduces <b>diode</b> <b>resistance</b> by two orders of magnitude under monochromatic illumination.
