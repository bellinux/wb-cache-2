40|$|Brachycephalic obstructive airway {{syndrome}} (BOAS) is {{an important}} health and welfare problem in several popular dog breeds. Whole-body barometric plethysmography (WBBP) is a non-invasive method that allows safe and repeated quantitative measurements of respiratory cycles on unsedated dogs. Here respiratory flow traces in <b>French</b> <b>bulldogs</b> from the pet population were characterised using WBBP, and a computational application was developed to recognise affected animals. Eighty-nine <b>French</b> <b>bulldogs</b> and twenty non-brachycephalic controls underwent WBBP testing. A respiratory functional grading system was used on each dog based on respiratory signs (i. e. respiratory noise, effort, etc.) before and after exercise. For development of an objective BOAS classifier, functional Grades 0 and I were considered to have insignificant clinical signs (termed here BOAS-) and Grades II and III to have significant signs (termed here BOAS+). A comparison between owner-perception of BOAS and functional grading revealed that 60 % of owners failed to recognise BOAS in dogs that graded BOAS+ in this study. WBBP flow traces {{were found to be}} significantly different between non-brachycephalic controls and Grade 0 French bulldogs; BOAS- and BOAS+ <b>French</b> <b>bulldogs.</b> A classifier was developed using quadratic discriminant analysis of the respiratory parameters to distinguish BOAS- and BOAS + <b>French</b> <b>bulldogs,</b> and a BOAS Index was calculated for each dog. A cut-off value of the BOAS Index was selected based on a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the classifier on the training group (n= 69) were 0. 97, 0. 93, 0. 95, and 0. 97, respectively. The classifier was validated using a test group of <b>French</b> <b>bulldogs</b> (n= 20) with an accuracy of 0. 95. WBBP offers objective screening for the diagnosis of BOAS in <b>French</b> <b>Bulldogs.</b> The technique may be applied to other brachycephalic breeds affected by BOAS, and possibly to other respiratory disease in dogs...|$|R
25|$|Syringomyelia* is a {{condition}} where a fluid filled sac develops in the spinal cord. The most important cause in dogs is by a Chiari I malformation, which is when an underdeveloped occipital bone interferes with spinal fluid circulation and results in fluid accumulation in the cervical spinal cord. This is a congenital disease most commonly found in small breeds such as the Brussels Griffon and the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Other breeds known to be affected include the Bichon Frisé, Boston terrier, bull terrier, Chihuahua, <b>French</b> <b>bulldog,</b> Havanese, King Charles spaniel (the English toy spaniel), Maltese, miniature dachshunds, miniature and toy poodles, Papillon, Pomeranian, Pugs, Shih Tzu, Staffordshire bull terrier, and the Yorkshire terrier. Signs may include ataxia, weakness, and neck pain.|$|E

500|$|Tatiana {{fell in love}} on {{at least}} one occasion. In an article in the December 2004 edition of the {{magazine}} Royalty Digest: A Journal of Record Peter de Malama wrote that his cousin, Dmitri Yakovlevich Malama, an officer in the Imperial Russian Cavalry, met Tatiana when he was wounded in 1914 and a romance later developed between Tatiana and the young man when he was appointed an equerry to the court of the Tsar at Tsarskoye Selo. Dmitri Malama gave Tatiana a <b>French</b> <b>bulldog</b> she named [...] "Ortipo" [...] in September 1914. [...] "Forgive me about the little dog," [...] Tatiana wrote to her mother on 30 September 1914. [...] "To say the truth, when he asked should I like to have it if he gave it to me, I at once said yes. You remember, I always wanted to have one, and only afterwards when we came home I thought that suddenly you might not like me having one. But I really was so pleased at the idea that I forgot about everything." [...] The dog died, but Malama gave her a replacement puppy. Tatiana took it with her to Yekaterinburg, where it died {{with the rest of the}} family. Malama paid the imperial family a visit some eighteen months after he gave Tatiana the first dog. [...] "My little Malama came for an hour yesterday evening," [...] wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on 17 March 1916. [...] "...Looks flourishing more of a man now, an adorable boy still. I must say a perfect son in law he w(ou)ld have been – why are foreign P(rin)ces not as nice!" [...] Malama was killed in August 1919 while commanding a unit of the White Russians fighting the civil war against the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine, according to Peter de Malama.|$|E

5000|$|<b>French</b> <b>bulldogs</b> {{can also}} suffer from an {{assortment}} of back, disk and spinal diseases and disorders, {{most of which are}} probably related {{to the fact that they}} were selectively chosen from the dwarf examples of the bulldog breed. This condition is also referred to as chondrodysplasia. <b>French</b> <b>bulldogs</b> are prone to having congenital hemivertebrae (also called [...] "butterfly vertebrae"), which will show on an x-ray. More advanced technologies such as myelograms, CT scans, or MRIs are used to detect spinal cord compression. Some breeders feel that only dogs that have been x-rayed and checked for spinal anomalies should be bred.|$|R

Then by some freak of fashion the Toy Bulldog became all the rage in Paris, with the result that the celebrated Bill George, of Canine Castle, Kensal New Town, the most eminent dog dealer of his or any other day, received carte blanche commissions from French customers to procure them light-weight Bulldogs, and by this means England was denuded of all the best specimens." ...|$|E

50|$|Another attempt of {{creating}} the Toy Bulldog was via crossbreeding <b>French</b> <b>Bulldogs,</b> English Bulldog, and their offspring to decrease the weight to desirable 20 pounds or so. There were several dogs, and the breed was presented by “The <b>French</b> Toy <b>Bulldog</b> Club of England” to the Kennel Club.

40|$|Extremely brachycephalic, or short-muzzled, dog breeds such as pugs, <b>French</b> <b>bulldogs,</b> and bulldogs {{are prone}} to the conformation-related {{respiratory}} disorder-brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS). Affected dogs present {{with a wide range}} of clinical signs from snoring and exercise intolerance, to life-threatening events such as syncope. In this study, conformational risk factors for BOAS that could potentially aid in breeding away from BOAS were sought. Six hundred and four pugs, <b>French</b> <b>bulldogs,</b> and bulldogs were included in the study. Soft tape measurements of the head and body were used and the inter-observer reproducibility was evaluated. Breed-specific models were developed to assess the associations between the conformational factors and BOAS status based on functional grading. The models were further validated by means of a BOAS index, which is an objective measurement of respiratory function using whole-body barometric plethysmography. The final models have good predictive power for discriminating BOAS (-) and BOAS (+) phenotypes indicated by the area under the curve values of > 80 % on the receiver operating curves. When other factors were controlled, stenotic nostrils were associated with BOAS in all three breeds; pugs and bulldogs with higher body condition scores (BCS) had a higher risk of developing BOAS. Among the standardized conformational measurements (i. e. craniofacial ratio (CFR), eye width ratio (EWR), skull index (SI), neck girth ratio (NGR), and neck length ratio (NLR)), for pugs EWR and SI, for <b>French</b> <b>bulldogs</b> NGR and NLR, and for bulldogs SI and NGR showed significant associations with BOAS status. However, the NGR in bulldogs was the only significant predictor that also had satisfactory inter-observer reproducibility. A NGR higher than 0. 71 in male bulldogs was predictive of BOAS with approximately 70 % sensitivity and specificity. In conclusion, stenotic nostrils, BCS, and NGR were found to be valid, easily applicable predictors for BOAS (+) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to detect {{vertebral}} malformations among <b>French</b> <b>Bulldogs</b> admitted between the years 2011 – 2016 due to the high popularity of the breed and the intentions to increase the breed welfare by reducing the occurrence of congenital anomalies. Besides, we aimed to look for gender predisposition, possible vertebral predisposition, occurrence of clinical symptoms and radiographic findings. A total of 73 <b>French</b> <b>Bulldogs</b> met the inclusion criteria (radiographs of the whole spine). In 67. 12 % (49) dogs we confirmed a vertebral anomaly and 32. 88 % (24) dogs were free of any vertebral anomaly. We identified a total of 67 abnormal vertebrae in 49 dogs, 13 cervical vertebrae (19. 4 %), 43 thoracic vertebrae (64. 2 %), and 11 abnormal lumbar vertebrae (16. 4 %). In this study, we found 44 hemivertebrae (65. 7 %) out of 67 abnormal vertebrae. We identified 64. 4 % (47 / 73) dogs with clinical signs (30 males, 17 females) and 36. 6 % (26 / 73) dogs without clinical signs (19 males, 7 females).

40|$|Background: Most {{information}} about spinal arachnoid diverticula (SADs) in dogs has been retrieved from relatively small case series. The {{aim of this}} study was to describe this disease in a larger number of dogs. Objectives: Description of the signalment, clinical presentation, and imaging findings of a large number of dogs with SADs. Animals: One hundred and twenty-two dogs with SADs. Methods: Retrospective case series study. All medical records were searched for a diagnosis of SAD. The diagnosis was made based on myelography, computed tomography myelography (CT-m), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: In the 122 dogs, 125 SADs were identified. Sixty-five were located in the cervical region and 60 in the thoracolumbar region. A higher body weight was significantly associated with a cervical localization of the SAD (P<. 001). Ninety-five dogs were male and 27 dogs were female. Male dogs were significantly overrepresented (P<. 0001). The most commonly affected breed was the Pug dog. Previous or concurrent spinal disorders, in the near proximity of the diagnosed SAD, were seen in 26 dogs. Eight of 13 <b>French</b> <b>Bulldogs</b> and 7 of 21 Pug dogs with SADs had a previous or concurrent spinal disease, whereas other spinal disorders occurred in only 1 of 17 Rottweilers with SADs. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Pug dogs and <b>French</b> <b>Bulldogs</b> might have a predisposition for SAD development. In a large percentage of these dogs, a concurrent spinal disorder, which might predispose to SAD formation, was diagnosed. The high prevalence in male dogs warrants further investigation...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} latero-lateral x-rays of the {{thoracic}} and lumbar vertebral column of 106 <b>French</b> <b>bulldogs</b> were examined. Occurrence of vertebral anomalies (wedge-shaped vertebrae, block vertebrae, transitional vertebrae), deviance {{from the normal}} number of vertebrae, variations of the spinous process and appearance of spondylosis were assessed. For evaluation of wedge-shaped vertebrae a graduation from degree 0 to degree 4 was developed using the percental deviation between the dorsal and the ventral length of the vertebral body. The vertebral bodies of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae were measured and classified from degree 0 to degree 4 based on the results. Additionally all vertebrae in which the dorsal and the ventral length of the vertebral body were lesser than the cranial and the caudal height of the vertebral body were noted and described as small vertebrae. Subsequently the results of each individual dog were used for a classification of the examined dogs. Depending on the occurrence of wedge-shaped vertebrae (degree 0 to degree 4) and the occurrence of small vertebrae the <b>French</b> <b>bulldogs</b> were classified in class I a/ b to class V a/ b. Furthermore it was statistically assessed whether the basis occurred more frequently dorsally or ventrally in wedge-shaped vertebrae. The results of the graduation are: Wedge-shaped vertebrae degree 0 : 53. 7 % Wedge-shaped vertebrae degree 1 : 33. 1 % Wedge-shaped vertebrae degree 2 : 8. 8 % Wedge-shaped vertebrae degree 3 : 2. 8 % Wedge-shaped vertebrae degree 4 : 1. 5 % Wedge-shaped vertebrae were found more frequently in the thoracic column then in the lumbar column, namely most notably between Th 6 and Th 8. The basis of wedge-shaped vertebrae degree 1 was more often ventral in the area Th 2 - Th 11 an L 7, while it was more frequently dorsal in the remaining areas. Against this the basis of wedge-shaped vertebrae degree 2 and above was more commonly dorsal in all areas. No disposition of sex in the occurrence of wedge-shaped vertebrae could be detected. 7. 4 % of all thoracic and lumbar vertebrae of the examined dogs were small vertebrae. The classification yielded the following results: Class I a: 0. 0 % Class I b: 0. 0 % Class II a: 13. 2 % Class II b: 2. 8 % Class III a: 1. 9 % Class III b: 5. 7 % Class IV a: 5. 7 % Class IV b: 12. 3 % Class V a: 9. 4 % Class V b: 49. 1 % One (0. 9 %) male dog had a block vertebra at Th 5 – Th 6. Transitional vertebrae were detected in 9 (8. 5 %) dogs, where at a thoracalisation of the first lumbar vertebra (n= 7, 6. 6 %) {{was the most common}} form. An aberrance of the normal number of vertebrae existed in 15. 1 % (n= 16) of the examined dogs. Fusions of spinous process were found in 16 (15. 1 %) <b>French</b> <b>bulldogs</b> occurring between Th 4 to Th 11. Spondylosis was evaluated using the graduation of EICHELBERG und WURSTER (1982) and the appearance with wedge-shaped vertebrae was examined. Spondylosis existed mainly in the caudal thoracic column and in the cranial lumbar column. It could be detected in wedge-shaped vertebrae as well as in normal vertebrae. The predominant part of wedge-shaped vertebrae was without spondylosis. Instabilities in the vertebral column induces by wedge-shaped vertebrae can lead to secondary spondylosis. An evaluation sheet for the examination of the thoracic and lumbar spine of <b>French</b> <b>bulldogs</b> was developed to help standardize the examination...|$|R
