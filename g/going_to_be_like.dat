Russell's first {{impression}} of Evans was negative ("this is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> pulling teeth all day"), but when he secretly heard Evans play, he completely changed his mind. Russell was then developing his magnum opus, the treatise Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization, in which he exposed that the Lydian mode was more compatible with tonality than the major scale used in most music. This new concept was ground-breaking in jazz, and would soon influence musicians like Miles Davis. Evans, who had already been acquainted with these ideas before, began {{to work with him}} in 1956.|$|E

In 2007 he formed The Terrible Twos, a children's band that has released two albums on Vagrant Records.

500|$|Some modern authors {{suggest that}} Druitt was {{dismissed}} {{because he was}} a homosexual or pederast and that may have driven him to suicide. One speculation is that the money found on his body was going to be used for payment to a blackmailer. Others, however, think that {{there is no evidence of}} homosexuality and that his suicide was instead precipitated by an hereditary psychiatric illness. His mother suffered from depression and was institutionalised from July 1888. She died in an asylum in Chiswick in 1890. His maternal grandmother committed suicide while insane, his aunt attempted suicide., and his eldest sister committed suicide in old age.

He considered abandoning the novel but a few weeks later re-wrote portions to use the attacks as a motivating factor for the distress the main character feels. In a 2003 interview he said, [...] "There I was, in the winter of 2001, with no idea what the summer of 2002 was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like.</b> ...

500|$|It {{was clear}} that Lasseter and Jobs {{believed}} that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg. Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up. In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on Toy Story at the Universal lot's Technicolor facility in Universal City, where DreamWorks was also located, he called Katzenberg and dropped by with Stanton. When Katzenberg asked {{what they were doing}} next, Lasseter described what would become A Bug's Life in detail. Lasseter respected Katzenberg's judgment and felt comfortable using him as a sounding board for creative ideas. Lasseter had high hopes for Toy Story, and he was telling friends throughout the tight-knit computer-animation business to get cracking on their own films. [...] "If this hits, it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> space movies after Star Wars" [...] for computer animation companies, he told various friends.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] was filmed in Los Angeles and {{directed}} by Wendy Morgan, who Roberts described as [...] "focused and passionate".

The music video and production was featured on the Through Nicola's Eyes webisodes, in which Roberts stated that she found {{the production of the}} music video very stressful. Talking about the experience in an interview with MTV News, Roberts stated that [...] "I'm nervous and I'm dreading the night before... I know I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> losing half a stone in weight overnight, so I'm {{going to have to get}} myself into the zone." [...] Roberts attributed her stress on the set of the video to her time with Girls Aloud, as she had always recorded music videos with four other members; this was the first time she had performed on her own. This meant that critical responses would only be aimed only at her. During the video shoot, Roberts further discussed the anxiety of a solo career claiming pressure from Morgan was making her feel uncomfortable. During the production, Roberts feared that feeling uncomfortable whilst shooting could have an overall negative effect on the video, explaining [...] "You've got to be strong and be professional and get through it, obviously enjoy it, but if you feel uncomfortable, you can't look uncomfortable otherwise it's not going to work".|$|E

The group eventually decided against the idea but, drawn by the technical capabilities of the format and the desire to do something that had never been done before, produced a DVD version of Rings..., making it the first album to be simultaneously released on CD and DVD. The DVD features a surround sound mix alongside music videos and remixes and was made possible only by the financial backing of Epic.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from television critics. Aaron Kinney from Salon magazine {{said that the}} episode title showed that the creators at least still {{had a sense of}} humor, but that the episode demonstrated some of the flaws that caused the series to jump the shark in the first place: [...] "cheesy melodrama, deathly slow pacing, and a lack of coherence". John Keegan from Critical Myth was also negative about the episode and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He called it [...] "one of the worst episodes of the season", and hoped that it was no indication of what the series finale was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like.</b> Furthermore, Keegan criticized the fact that David Duchovny did not make a cameo appearance [...] "either full frame or in the distance", given his history with the Lone Gunmen. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five, and noted that [...] "there's nothing celebratory" [...] about the entry. The two were highly critical of the episode's conclusion, calling it [...] "such a bland way of dying that for a moment, you feel you must have missed the point". Shearman and Pearson, furthermore, argued that [...] "The Lone Gunmen deserved better. No, worse than that—we deserved better." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, criticized the [...] "goofy tone" [...] of the episode, saying it felt [...] "very out of place" [...] {{within the context of the}} series.|$|E

500|$|Before the Clash's founding, the band's future {{members were}} active in {{different}} parts of the London music scene. John Graham Mellor sang and played rhythm guitar in the pub rock act the 101'ers, which formed in 1974. By the time the Clash came together two years later, he had already abandoned his original stage name, [...] "Woody" [...] Mellor, in favour of [...] "Joe Strummer", a reference to his rudimentary strumming skills on the ukulele as a busker in the London Underground. Mick Jones played guitar in protopunk band London SS, which rehearsed for much of 1975 without ever playing a live show and recording only a single demo. London SS was managed by Bernard Rhodes, a sometime associate of impresario Malcolm McLaren and a friend of the members of the McLaren-managed band, the Sex Pistols. Jones and his bandmates became friendly with Sex Pistols Glen Matlock and Steve Jones, who would assist them as they tried out potential new members. Among those who auditioned for London SS without making the cut were Paul Simonon, who tried out as a vocalist, and drummer Terry Chimes. Nicky Headon drummed with the band for a week, then quit. After London SS broke up in early 1976, Rhodes continued as Jones's manager. In February, Jones saw the Sex Pistols perform for the first time: [...] "You knew straight away that was it, and this was what it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> from now on. It was a new scene, new values—so different from what had happened before. A bit dangerous." [...] At the instigation of Rhodes, Jones contacted Simonon in March, suggesting he learn an instrument so he could join the new band Jones was organising. Soon Jones, Simonon on bass, Keith Levene on guitar and [...] "whoever we could find really to play the drums" [...] were rehearsing. Chimes was asked to audition for the new band and got the job, although he soon quit.|$|E

That feeling of being on the stage, knowing it's your best – I love that. I needed a break. I needed to be hungry again." [...] When asked about her next album, she said she had been experimenting in her home studio with live musicians, stripping down her sound and playing the piano. Spears wanted the album to represent her Louisiana roots, explaining that she grew up listening to blues. [...] "When I was little, I would listen to myself [...] But the record label signs you, and you're just thankful to get a hit song. You can't really show off your voice and where you came from.
