5000|$|In 2001, <b>Hadcock</b> {{purchased}} the old North West Water building on Ribbleton Lane in Preston, and so created [...] "The Watermark", {{a mix of}} office space and artists studios. The artists’ wing of the building has been designed as a creative hub and community to welcome and incubate a mix of up and coming and established designers in Preston. He has since developed this vision, creating a sister building ‘The Benchmark’. In 2000 <b>Hadcock</b> also bought the 135-year-old Roach Bridge Tissues Paper Company, a Lancashire-based company specialising in the printing and conversion of tissue wrapping paper for the high street.|$|E

40|$|Radiolabeled sst 2 and sst 3 antagonists {{are better}} {{candidates}} for tumor targeting than agonists with comparable binding characteristics (Ginj, M.; Zhang, H.; Waser, B.; Cescato, R.; Wild, D.; Erchegyi, J.; Rivier, J.; Mäcke, H. R.; Reubi, J. C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006, 103, 16436 - 16441.). Because {{most of the}} neuroendocrine tumors express sst 2, we used the known antagonists acetyl- pNO 2 Phe (2) - c[dCys (3) -Tyr (7) - dTrp (8) -Lys (9) -Thr (10) -Cys (14) ]- dTyr (15) -NH 2 (1) (Bass, R. T.; Buckwalter, B. L.; Patel, B. P.; Pausch, M. H.; Price, L. A.; Strnad, J.; <b>Hadcock,</b> J. R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996, 50, 709 - 715. Bass, R. T.; Buckwalter, B. L.; Patel, B. P.; Pausch, M. H.; Price, L. A.; Strnad, J.; <b>Hadcock,</b> J. R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997, 51, 170; Erratum.) and H-Cpa (2) - c[dCys (3) -Tyr (7) - dTrp (8) -Lys (9) -Thr (10) -Cys (14) ]- 2 Nal (15) -NH 2 (7) (Hocart, S. J.; Jain, R.; Murphy, W. A.; Taylor, J. E.; Coy, D. H. J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 1863 - 1871.) as leads for analogues with increased sst 2 binding affinity and selectivity. Among the 32 analogues reported here, DOTA- pNO 2 Phe (2) - c[dCys (3) -Tyr (7) - dAph (8) (Cbm) -Lys (9) -Thr (10) -Cys (14) - dTyr (15) -NH 2 (3) and DOTA-Cpa (2) - c[dCys (3) -Aph (7) (Hor) - dAph (8) (Cbm) -Lys (9) -Thr (10) -Cys (14) ]- dTyr (15) -NH 2 (31) had the highest sst 2 binding affinity and selectivity. All of the analogues tested kept their sst 2 antagonistic properties (i. e., did not affect calcium release in vitro and competitively antagonized the agonistic effect of [Tyr (3) ]octreotide). Moreover, in an immunofluorescence-based internalization assay, the new analogues prevented sst 2 internalization induced by the sst 2 agonist [Tyr (3) ]octreotide without being active by themselves. In conclusion, several analogues (in particular 3, 31, and 32) have outstanding sst 2 binding and functional antagonistic properties and, because of their DOTA moiety, are excellent candidates for in vivo targeting of sst 2 -expressing cancers...|$|E
