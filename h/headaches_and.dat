5|$|All {{octopuses}} are venomous, {{but only}} a few species pose a significant threat to humans. Blue-ringed octopuses in the genus Hapalochlaena, which live around Australia and New Guinea, bite humans only if severely provoked, but their venom kills 25% of human victims. Another tropical species, Octopus apollyon, causes severe inflammation that can last for over a month even if treated correctly, and the bite of Octopus rubescens can cause necrosis that lasts longer than one month if untreated, and <b>headaches</b> <b>and</b> weakness persisting for up to a week even if treated.|$|E

5|$|Criminal {{trials for}} the accused {{commenced}} in the Denpasar District Court on 11 October 2005. Three {{of the four}} arrested at the Melasti Bungalows, Nguyen, Chen and Norman, were tried together, with the remaining six defendants tried separately. All defendants faced a maximum penalty of death by firing squad if found guilty. The trials were often delayed due to the defendants complaining of illness, <b>headaches</b> <b>and</b> nausea. Australia's prime minister, John Howard, said the Australian government would oppose any death sentences imposed.|$|E
5|$|During a sandstorm, the {{wind-blown sand}} {{particles}} become electrically charged. Such electric fields, which {{range in size}} up to 80 kV/m, can produce sparks and cause interference with telecommunications equipment. They are also unpleasant for humans and can cause <b>headaches</b> <b>and</b> nausea. The electric fields are caused by collision between airborne particles and by the impacts of saltating sand grains landing on the ground. The mechanism is little understood but the particles usually have a negative charge when their diameter is under 250 μm and a positive one when they are over 500 μm.|$|E
5|$|If the TSH {{level is}} normal or low and serum free T4 levels are low, this is suggestive of central {{hypothyroidism}} (not enough TSH or TRH secretion by the pituitary gland or hypothalamus). There {{may be other}} features of hypopituitarism, such as menstrual cycle abnormalities and adrenal insufficiency. There might also be symptoms of a pituitary mass such as <b>headaches</b> <b>and</b> vision changes. Central hypothyroidism should be investigated further to determine the underlying cause.|$|E
40|$|Background. Tinnitus <b>and</b> <b>headache</b> are {{frequent}} disorders. Here, we aimed {{to investigate whether}} the occurrence of headache among tinnitus patients is purely coincidental or whether tinnitus <b>and</b> <b>headache</b> are pathophysiologically linked. We investigated a large sample of patients with tinnitus <b>and</b> <b>headache</b> to estimate prevalence rates of different headache forms, to determine the relationship between tinnitus laterality <b>and</b> <b>headache</b> laterality, <b>and</b> to explore the relationship between tinnitus <b>and</b> <b>headache</b> over time. Method. Patients who presented at a tertiary referral center because of tinnitus <b>and</b> reported comorbid <b>headache</b> {{were asked to complete}} validated questionnaires to determine the prevalence of migraine <b>and</b> tension-type <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> to assess tinnitus severity. In addition, several questions about the relationship between <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> tinnitus were asked. Results. Datasets of 193 patients with tinnitus <b>and</b> <b>headache</b> were analysed. 44. 6 % suffered from migraine, 13 % from tension-type <b>headache,</b> <b>and</b> 5. 7 % from both. Headache laterality was significantly related to tinnitus laterality and in the majority of patients fluctuations in symptom severity of tinnitus <b>and</b> <b>headache</b> were interrelated. Conclusion. These findings suggest a significant relationship between tinnitus <b>and</b> <b>headache</b> laterality <b>and</b> symptom interaction over time and argue against a purely coincidental cooccurrence of tinnitus <b>and</b> <b>headache.</b> Both disorders may be linked by common pathophysiological mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of migraine with co-existing tension-type <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> neck pain {{is high in}} the general population. However, {{there is very little}} literature on the characteristics of these combined conditions. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate a) the {{prevalence of}} migraine with co-existing tension-type <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> neck pain in a clinic-based sample, b) the level of physical activity, psychological well-being, perceived stress and self-rated health in persons with migraine <b>and</b> co-existing tension-type <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> neck pain compared to healthy controls, c) the perceived ability of persons with migraine <b>and</b> co-existing tension-type <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> neck pain to perform physical activity, and d) which among the three conditions (migraine, tension-type headache or neck pain) is rated as the most burdensome condition. Methods: The study was conducted at a tertiary referral specialised headache centre where questionnaires on physical activity, psychological well-being, perceived stress and self-rated health were completed by 148 persons with migraine and 100 healthy controls matched by sex and average age. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to assess characteristics of migraine, tension-type <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> neck pain. Results: Out of 148 persons with migraine, 100 (67 %) suffered from co-existing tension-type <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> neck pain. Only 11 % suffered from migraine only. Persons with migraine <b>and</b> co-existing tension-type <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> neck pain had lower level of physical activity and psychological well-being, higher level of perceived stress and poorer self-rated health compared to healthy controls. They reported reduced ability to perform physical activity owing to migraine (high degree), tension-type <b>headache</b> (moderate degree) <b>and</b> neck pain (low degree). The most burdensome condition was migraine, followed by tension-type <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> neck pain. Conclusions: Migraine with co-existing tension-type <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> neck pain was highly prevalent in a clinic-based sample. Persons with migraine <b>and</b> co-existing tension-type <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> neck pain may require more individually tailored interventions to increase the level of physical activity, and to improve psychological well-being, perceived stress and self-rated health...|$|R
40|$|A {{subjective}} {{quality of}} life measurement method is introduced to calculate the compensating income variation for diseases and handicaps.

It is found that severe <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> migraine have a large effect on well being and that the compensating income variation for severe <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> migraine is substantial.

The case was withdrawn after Sayers claimed it was filed without his permission, but he filed a new lawsuit in January 2014 along with six other former players.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum dusts and fumes, {{generated}} by mining or metalworking, can be toxic, especially if ingested (including dust {{trapped in the}} sinuses and later swallowed). Low levels of prolonged exposure can cause irritation to the eyes and skin. Direct inhalation or ingestion of molybdenum and its oxides should be avoided. OSHA regulations specify the maximum permissible molybdenum exposure in an 8-hour day as 5mg/m3. Chronic exposure to 60 to 600mg/m3 can cause symptoms including fatigue, <b>headaches</b> <b>and</b> joint pains. At levels of 5000mg/m3, molybdenum is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{definite}} relationship between the vascular type of benign sexual <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> benign exertional <b>headache.</b> Forty five patients with benign vascular sexual headache were reviewed. Twenty seven (60 %) experienced benign vascular sexual <b>headache</b> alone <b>and</b> eighteen (40 %) had experienced both benign vascular sexual <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> benign exertional <b>headache</b> {{on at least one}} occasion. The mean age was 34. 3 years with a male:female ratio of 5. 4 : 1. Thirty patients with a history of benign vascular sexual headache were followed for an average of 74 months. A personal history of migraine was found in 47 % of cases and a family history of migraine in 30 %. Forty one per cent of patients with benign vascular sexual headache alone had recurrences after diagnosis, and stress and fatigue were considered major contributing factors to the initial <b>and</b> recurrent <b>headache.</b> Nine patients had experienced benign vascular sexual <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> benign exertional <b>headache</b> within 72 hours of each other on at least one occasion, often with a residual headache between the two. Four patients experienced their benign vascular sexual <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> benign exertional <b>headache</b> separated by months to years.
