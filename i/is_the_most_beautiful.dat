500|$|Richardson {{was sentenced}} to six months' imprisonment, the maximum allowed for {{destruction}} of an artwork. In {{a statement to the}} Women's Social and Political Union shortly afterwards, Richardson explained, [...] "I have tried to destroy the picture of {{the most beautiful woman in}} mythological history as a protest against the Government for destroying Mrs. Pankhurst, who <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> character in modern history." [...] She added in a 1952 interview that she didn't like [...] "the way men visitors gaped at it all day long".|$|E
500|$|This {{introductory}} stanza {{is followed}} by a mythological exemplum to demonstrate this idea – that of Helen of Troy, who abandoned her husband, daughter, and parents to be with the man she loved. [...] This use of Helen as a mythological exemplum might be seen as problematic: after all, Helen <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> mortal, and yet Sappho has her judging Paris to be the most beautiful. [...] Harold Zellner explains this apparent paradox {{as an integral part of}} the argument that Sappho makes that the most beautiful is the one that one loves: the apparent contradiction between Helen being the most beautiful, and Helen finding Paris the most beautiful, can be resolved if we agree with Sappho's definition of beauty.|$|E
500|$|On {{the way to}} Constantinople, Cacambo {{reveals that}} Cunégonde—now horribly ugly—currently washes dishes {{on the banks of}} the Propontis as a slave for a Transylvanian prince by the name of Rákóczi. After {{arriving}} at the Bosphorus, they board a galley where, to Candide's surprise, he finds Pangloss and Cunégonde's brother among the rowers. Candide buys their freedom and further passage at steep prices. The baron and Pangloss relate how they survived, but despite the horrors he has been through, Pangloss's optimism remains unshaken: [...] "I still hold to my original opinions, because, after all, I'm a philosopher, and it wouldn't be proper for me to recant, since Leibniz cannot be wrong, and since pre-established harmony <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> thing in the world, along with the plenum and subtle matter." ...|$|E

Praise for Liverpool also came from outside England, including from Argentine legend Diego Maradona, who said, [...] "Even the Brazil team that won the 1970 World Cup could not have staged a comeback with Milan leading 3–0...The English club proved that miracles really do exist. I've now made Liverpool my English team. They showed that football <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> sport of all.

500|$|Churchill {{first saw}} Chartwell in July 1921, {{shortly before the}} house and estate were to be auctioned. He {{returned}} the same month with his wife Clementine, who was initially attracted to the property, although her enthusiasm cooled during subsequent visits. In September 1922, when the house had failed to sell at auction, he was offered it for £5,500. He paid £5,000, after his first offer of £4,800, made because [...] "the house {{will have to be}} very largely rebuilt, and the presence of dry rot is a very serious adverse factor", was rejected. The seller was Captain Archibald John Campbell Colquhoun, who had inherited the house in June 1922 on the death of his brother. Campbell Colquhoun had been a contemporary of Churchill's at Harrow School in the 1880s. On completion of the sale in September 1922, Churchill wrote to him; [...] "I am very glad indeed to have become the possessor of [...] "Chartwell". I have been searching for two years for a home in the country and the site <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> and charming I have ever seen". The sale was concluded on 11 November 1922.|$|E
500|$|Although Kiedis' {{drug use}} {{disrupted}} the early recording process, the Chili Peppers still had an enjoyable time recording the album. [...] The band was musically {{inspired by the}} rejoining of their original drummer Jack Irons, which added [...] "such an important and different element to our chemistry." [...] Beinhorn encouraged the band to expand their musical horizons on the album, and although the band were initially uncomfortable stepping out of their comfort zone, the members began to feel that Beinhorn was helping them produce their best work. [...] Slovak helped Kiedis record his vocals on the album. [...] In between takes, Slovak would run around the studio out of excitement and say [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> thing we've ever done." [...] Slovak reflected on his deep connection to the album in his diary; [...] "It was so fun. [...] I'm so extremely proud of everybody's workit is at times genius." [...] During a jam session, the guitarist created a melodic riff which differed greatly in style from the band's previous work. [...] While Slovak nearly abandoned the riff {{out of fear that}} it {{was too much of a}} departure stylistically, Beinhorn saw potential in the new melody-based style and encouraged Slovak to turn the short tune into a full song. [...] While the band was skeptical at first, each member began writing their own musical parts and the song became one of the album's three singles, [...] "Behind the Sun".|$|E

[...] The review continued: [...] "Every number is so outstanding {{that it is difficult to}} decide which will be the most popular." [...] The review in New York World-Telegram found the show to be [...] "the ultimate modern blending of music and popular theatre to date, with the finest kind of balance between story and song, and hilarity and heartbreak." [...] Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times especially praised Pinza's performance: [...] "Mr. Pinza's bass voice <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> that has been heard on a Broadway stage for an eon or two. He sings... with infinite delicacy of feeling and loveliness of tone." [...] He declared that [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", sung by Pinza, [...] "ought to become reasonably immortal." [...] Richard Watts, Jr. of the New York Post focused on Mary Martin's performance, writing, [...] "nothing I have ever seen her do prepared me for the loveliness, humor, gift for joyous characterization, and sheer lovableness of her portrayal of Nellie Forbush... who is so shocked to find her early racial prejudices cropping up. Hers is a completely irresistible performance." ...|$|E
500|$|Spanish horses {{also were}} spread widely {{as a tool}} of {{diplomacy}} by the government of Spain, which granted both horses and export rights to favored citizens and to other royalty. As early as the 15th century, the Spanish horse was widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean, and was known in northern European countries, despite being less common and more expensive there. As time went on, kings from across Europe, including every French monarch from Francis I to Louis XVI, had equestrian portraits created showing themselves riding Spanish-type horses. The kings of France, including Louis XIII and Louis XIV, especially preferred the Spanish horse; the head groom to Henri IV, Salomon de la Broue, said in 1600, [...] "Comparing the best horses, I give the Spanish horse first place for its perfection, because it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful,</b> noble, graceful and courageous". War horses from Spain and Portugal began to be introduced to England in the 12th century, and importation continued through the 15th century. In the 16th century, Henry VIII received gifts of Spanish horses from Charles V, Ferdinand II of Aragon and the Duke of Savoy and others when he wed Katherine of Aragon. [...] He also purchased additional war and riding horses through agents in Spain. By 1576, Spanish horses made up one third of British royal studs at Malmesbury and Tutbury. The Spanish horse peaked in popularity in Great Britain during the 17th century, when horses were freely imported from Spain and exchanged as gifts between royal families. With the introduction of the Thoroughbred, interest in the Spanish horse faded after the mid-18th century, although they remained popular through the early 19th century. The Conquistadors of the 16thcentury rode Spanish horses, particularly animals from Andalusia, and the modern Andalusian descended from similar bloodstock. By 1500, Spanish horses were established in studs on Santo Domingo, and Spanish horses made their way into the ancestry of many breeds founded in North and South America. Many Spanish explorers from the 16th century on brought Spanish horses with them for use as war horses and later as breeding stock. By 1642, the Spanish horse had spread to Moldovia, to the stables of Transylvanian prince George Rakoczi.|$|E
