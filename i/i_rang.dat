500|$|Artist Dave Gibbons, who had {{collaborated with}} Moore on {{previous}} projects, recalled he [...] "must have {{heard on the}} grapevine {{that he was doing}} a treatment for a new miniseries. <b>I</b> <b>rang</b> Alan up, saying I’d like to be involved with what he was doing." [...] and Moore sent him the story outline. Gibbons told Giordano he wanted to draw the series Moore proposed and Moore approved. Gibbons brought colorist John Higgins onto the project because he liked his [...] "unusual" [...] style; Higgins lived near the artist, which allowed the two to [...] "discuss [...] and have some kind of human contact rather than just sending it across the ocean". Len Wein joined the project as its editor, while Giordano stayed on to oversee it. Both Wein and Giordano stood back and [...] "got out of their way"; Giordano remarked later, [...] "Who copy-edits Alan Moore, for God's sake?" ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1977 tour Bruford {{declined}} {{an offer}} to return as second drummer, leaving Collins searching for a replacement. He heard American drummer Chester Thompson, of Frank Zappa's band and Weather Report, play a drum passage on [...] "More Trouble Every Day" [...] from Zappa's live album Roxy & Elsewhere. Collins said, [...] "It floored me completely ... I had never met him. <b>I</b> <b>rang</b> him up and said, 'Hi Chester, I've heard your stuff, {{would you like to}} play with Genesis?' ... He didn't even audition!" [...] Genesis toured Wind & Wuthering from January to July 1977 across Europe, North America, and for the first time, Brazil. The stage show cost £400,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). which featured a new PA system, lasers and smoke, and lighting supplied from two rows of Boeing 747 aircraft landing lights. Touring began on 1 January with three sold-out shows at the Rainbow Theatre in London, where 80,000 applications were made for the 8,000 available tickets. They returned to London for three nights at Earls Court, then the largest arena in Britain, supported by Richie Havens. The band's growing popularity in North America led to television appearances and concerts organised in larger venues than previous tours, including Madison Square Garden in New York City. Their Brazilian dates were attended by over 150,000 people and a proposed 100,000-person gig was cancelled over rioting fears. An armed bodyguard accompanied each member throughout their stay.|$|E
2500|$|The idea to base {{the album}} around the {{folklore}} {{concept of the}} seventh son of a seventh son came to bassist Steve Harris after he read Orson Scott Card's Seventh Son. Harris states, [...] "It was our seventh studio album and I didn't have a title for it or any ideas at all. Then I read {{the story of the}} seventh son, this mystical figure that was supposed to have all these paranormal gifts, like second sight and what have you, and it was more, at first, that it was just a good title for the seventh album, you know? But then <b>I</b> <b>rang</b> [...] and started talking about it and the idea just grew." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} localise {{with respect to}} some multiplicative set S in a noncommutative ring, certain {{conditions}} must be satisfied by S. When such conditions are satisfied, the resulting localisation is either a left or right localistion (as will be explained) but, in general, not both. The main aim {{of this paper is}} to show that in the case where R is a prime Noetherian P. <b>I.</b> <b>ring,</b> all localisations are in fact two sided and can be thought of as a localisation with respect to a certain collection of prime ideals of R. The project is split into seven chapters which we outline below. Chapter 1 - Here we introduce P. <b>I.</b> <b>rings</b> and outline some of their basic properties. Chapter 2 - In this chapter we state and prove two important theorems regarding P. <b>I.</b> <b>rings.</b> These are Kapansky’s Theorem and Posner’s Theorem. Chapter 3 - Using Posner’s Theorem, we introduce the Trace Ring of a prime P. <b>I.</b> <b>ring</b> R. We show that, in this extension ring, localisation is particularly wellbehaved. Chapter 4 - Here we introduce, more formally, the idea of localisation in a noncommutativ...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Australian journalist Nick Milligan on 25 March 2011, Anderson explained, [...] "I was in Los Angeles in 1989 recording an album which the 'Bound For Glory' single came off and I was hanging around with the Gunners {{and a lot of}} other LA bad boy rock bands that we supposedly influenced. I realised then that apart from the fact that I was there to establish myself as a singer songwriter, there was still this great following for the band. <b>I</b> <b>rang</b> up the other members and said 'Let's reform. We've been apart for three years or more.' It was long enough for us to settle our differences and let all the wounds heal. <b>I</b> <b>rang</b> up each of the original members that were still interested and they all said, 'Yeah, let's get together.' So I said we should negotiate a deal where the band can come over and record in Los Angeles. But, of course, that was the year that our original drummer [...] "Digger" [...] Royall kicked his heroin habit. While he was recovering on methadone, cancer exploded through his body, quite sadly. That was the irony of it, because the cancer had been suppressed by the heroin addiction. Within months he was dead. That shook the band so badly on a personal level, because we had been so enthusiastic to reform. We didn't reform until '92. In '93, the word got around, because we had reformed with our existing drummer Paul DeMarco. The Gunners heard we were out playing again and said, 'We want you to do our support gigs throughout Australia.' We did those two Guns N' Roses raceways gigs - Eastern Creek in Sydney and the raceway down in Melbourne." ...|$|E

But I told the producers they were having a joke if they thought I would front a show with that title. The original panel of judges was going to be Simon Cowell, Fern Britton and Piers Morgan. I was the host. Then when I had the row with ITV I was banned from the studios. I remember <b>I</b> <b>rang</b> Simon and told him he had a huge hit on his hands, {{but there was no way}} I could do it. I said, if I am banned I have to be banned from everything. I can’t be a hypocrite and come in and do this. I had to bow out." ...|$|E

50|$|It {{structurally}} {{looks like}} paxilline {{which is a}} related tremor inducer. There are multiple lolitrems which are labelled by a letter. The difference between them is the position and number of aryl and hydroxyl substituents plus the absence or presence of an <b>I</b> <b>ring.</b> The <b>I</b> <b>ring</b> seems to be necessary for prolonged tremors to occur. Intermediate metabolites such as terpendoles and paspaline can become lolitrems by addition of two rings (A and B) at the C20-C21 position to the indole moiety of the molecule.|$|R
