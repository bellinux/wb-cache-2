As I walked past them Hsi Hsia [...] pointed out a line of dragon flags between the Japanese ones and said that the men holding them were all Manchu [...] "bannermen" [...] who had been waiting for me to come for twenty years. These words brought tears to my eyes, and I was more strongly convinced than ever that my future was very hopeful". Puyi also noted he was [...] "too preoccupied with my hopes and hates" [...] to realize the [...] "cold comfort that the Changchun citizens, silent from terror and hatred, were giving me". Puyi's friend, the British journalist Woodhead, who covered his arrival in Manchuria, wrote [...] "outside official circles, I met no Chinese who felt any enthusiasm for the new regime", and that the city of Harbin was being terrorized by Chinese and Russian gangsters working for the Japanese, making Harbin [...] "lawless... even its main street unsafe after dark".
