40|$|Background. Most {{studies on}} {{multiple}} <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> behaviors among adolescents have cross-sectionally studied {{a limited number}} of health behaviors or determinants. Purpose. To examine the prevalence, longitudinal patterns and predictors of individual and multiple <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> behaviors among adolescents. Methods. Eight <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> behaviors (no regular consumption of fruit, vegetables or breakfast, overweight or obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol use and cannabis use) were assessed in a prospective population study (second and third wave).

40|$|Objective: <b>Health</b> <b>risk</b> {{appraisal}} {{is often}} utilized to modify individualâ€™s health behavior, especially concerning disease prevention, and web-based <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> appraisal services are being {{provided to the}} general public in Korea. However, {{little is known about the}} psychological effect of the <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> appraisal even though poorly communicated information by the web-based service may result in unintended adverse health outcomes. This study was conducted to explore the psychological effect of <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> appraisal using epidemiological risk factor profile. Methods: We conducted a randomized trial comparing risk factor list type <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> appraisal and <b>risk</b> score type <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> appraisal. We studied 60 women aged 30 years and older who had no cancer. Anxiety level was assessed using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory YZ. Results: The results of multivariate analysis showed that risk status was the independent predictors of increase of state anxiety after <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> appraisal intervention when age, education, <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> appraisal type, numeracy, state anxiety, trait anxiety, and <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> appraisal type by risk status interaction was adjusted. Women who had higher risk status had an odd of having increased anxiety that was about 5 times greater than women who had lower risk status. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that communicating the risk status by individual <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> appraisal service can induce psychological sequelae, especially in women having higher risk status. Hospitals, institutes, or medical schools that are operating or planning to operate the online <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> appraisal service should take side effects such as psychological sequelae into consideration...|$|R

40|$|<b>Health</b> <b>risk</b> {{behaviors}} {{are responsible for}} the majority of morbidity and mortality among adolescents. Researchers have identified three sources of risk-taking in adolescents ? dispositional, ecological and biological. The Bioecological Model incorporates these three sources of risk-taking, however it lacks explanatory power. For this reason, this thesis focused on explaining <b>risk</b> perception of <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> behaviors (smoking cigarette, alcohol and marijuana use), and <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> behaviors by integrating the Bioecological Model with a more specific Health Belief Model. The relationship between <b>risk</b> perception and <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> behavior was also investigated as a first step in understanding adolescent decision-making using the Health Belief Model. Adolescents from a suburban Indiana area were asked to complete the Adolescent <b>Health</b> <b>Risk</b> Behavior Survey which assessed egocentrism, self-esteem, social norms, risk perceptions, and the incidence and prevalence of health endangering behaviors. Hierarchical linear regression was used to determine the ability of the systems in the Bioecological Model and their specific variables to explain <b>risk</b> perception of <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> behaviors. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to determine the ability of the systems in the Bioecological Model and their specific variables to explain <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> behaviors and to moderate the relationships between <b>risk</b> perception and <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> behaviors. Based on the results, it was confirmed that the Bioecological Model is important in understanding adolescent?s <b>risk</b> perception of <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> behaviors, and their self-reported <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> behaviors. It is also important in understanding the relationship between <b>risk</b> perception and <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> behaviors. Adolescent Variables, Microsystem, and Mesosystem were significant in predicting adolescent risk perception of all <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> behaviors examined, and self-reported smoking cigarette behavior and marijuana use. Adolescent variables and Microsystem were the only systems to predict adolescent self-reported alcohol use. The relationship between risk perception and reported smoking cigarette behavior was moderated by Adolescent Variables, Microsystem and Mesosystem, however for alcohol use the path was moderated by Adolescent Variables and for marijuana use the path was moderated by the Mesosytem. Results of this thesis imply the importance of considering the contribution of Bioecological Model variables when implementing prevention intervention programs specific to adolescent <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> behaviors...|$|R

5|$|Health {{issues in}} American {{football}} comprise {{a large number}} of <b>health</b> <b>risks</b> associated with participating in the sport. Injuries are relatively common in American football, due to its nature as a full-contact game. Injuries occur during both practice and games. Several factors can affect the frequency of injuries: epidemiological studies have shown older players can be at a greater risk, while equipment and experienced coaches can reduce the risk of injury. Common injuries include strains, sprains, fractures, dislocations, and concussions. Concussions have become a concern, as they increase the risk of mental illnesses like dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

The relation between socio-economic status (SES) and <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> behaviors was examined, by testing both the main and interaction effects of SES and gender on separate <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> behaviors on one hand, and on the behaviors cumulatively on the other. The data were derived from 1984 adolescents in the four northern provinces of The Netherlands. SES was measured by means of the educational level and the occupational status of both parents. Four <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> behaviors were included in this study: smoking, alcohol consumption, soft drug use, and (no) physical exercise. We found that the relationships between SES and <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> behaviors are not as linear as is often found in adulthood. Our findings can be characterised overall by an absence of relationship between SES and <b>health</b> <b>risk</b> behaviors. The only exception applies to sport, which is linearly related to SES. Adolescents in the lower SES groups engage in sport less than adolescents in the higher SES groups. There was an irregular relationship between the father's occupational status and the adolescents' smoking and drinking.

5|$|Divers {{operate in}} an {{environment}} for which {{the human body is}} not well suited. They face special physical and <b>health</b> <b>risks</b> when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also hazards of the specific diving environment, and hazards related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. Hazards inherent in the diver include pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour and competence of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional hazards of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task.|$|E
