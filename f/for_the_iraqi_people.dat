40|$|After {{decades of}} growth and development, Iraq has become amongst the worst {{performing}} states worldwide as a legacy of successive wars and sanctions despite the rich endowment with ample natural resources and capable human resources. Many observers expected that the “new” Iraq after the US “liberation” in 2003 will be a tolerant and unified nation-state that “with a degree of civil society” will grant and secure <b>the</b> human rights <b>for</b> all <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people</b> (Gresham 2006 : 27). However, due to the external military intervention lead by the US, the Iraq state collapsed after the 2003 war (Diamond 2005) {{as well as its}} economic, educational, health systems and infrastructure; and, Iraq’s development indicators are amongst the lowest globally (Hassin 2010). Australia’s controversial joining of Bush’s Coalition of Willing has been discussed by various intellectual studies from different angles. It is discussed in the socio-political discourse from an international relations perspective (Verrier 2003), social resistance to war (Hil 2008), and the implications on the Australian internal politics (McAllister and Bean 2006) and federal elections (Kelton 2008). However, there is scarce evidence about any research engaging with Australia’s roles in post-conflict nation building in Iraq. This article explores developmental roles and initiatives played and funded by Australia in Iraq since the invasion in 2003. Based on Hippler’s (Hippler 2004 - 2005) multi-faceted approach to nation building this paper will study Australia’s roles in the three interlinked dimensions or “starting points” for nation building: improvement of living conditions, structural reforms and integration of the national political system. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Provincial {{reconstruction}} teams (PRTs) {{were established}} {{as a result of}} the need to develop <b>the</b> infrastructure necessary <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Afghan and <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people</b> to succeed in a post-conflict environment. The efforts of PRTs take place every day during a time when major conflict is commonplace in both countries. PRTs have become an integral part of the long-term strategy to transition the lines of security, governance, and economics to the indigenous people. Integrated appropriately, PRTs serve as combat multipliers for maneuver commanders engaged in governance and economics, as well as other critical lines of operation. In addition, PRTs serve as force multipliers for U. S. Government (USG) development agencies engaged across the stability and reconstruction sectors. This playbook focuses on PRTs in general, with additional information specific to Iraq and Afghanistan. The information contained in this playbook comes from multiple sources inside and outside the USG with the understanding that the manner in which PRTs operate is likely to change over time. The intent of this publication is to share knowledge, support discussion, and impart lessons and information in an expeditious manner. This Center for Army Lessons Learned (CALL) publication is not a doctrinal product. The information provided in this publication is written by USG employees for those individuals who will serve in a stability and reconstruction environment.

40|$|<b>The</b> humanist <b>Iraqi</b> poet, Ma‟ruf al-Rusafi born in al-Rusafa {{district}} of Baghdad in 1875 A. D, his early education {{was confined to}} the traditional Kuttab (Quranic School). He later joined „Al-Rushdiyya‟Military School in Baghdad, but left after three years, having failed the course. Then he was fortunate in having al-Shaikh Mahmud Shukri alAlusi, an authority in Arabic, as his guide for twelve years, who introducrd him to Islamic Priciples, Sciences, Sufism and Linguistics. Al-Rusafi {{began his career as}} a school teacher of Arabic; then he went to Istanbul where he lectured in Arabic and edited the Newspaper „Sabil al-Rashad‟. In 1912 A. D. he became one of the Representative of Iraq in the Turkish Chamber of Deputies. Then he returned to Iraq where he unwillingly accepted the post of vice chairman of a committee on Translation and Arabization and edited the short-lived daily newspaper “Al-A‟mal”. He started his literary career by publishing articles on Social and Political issues in Syrian and Egyptian Journals such as „Al-Muqtataf‟ and „Al-Mu‟ayyad‟. Al-Rusafi‟s reputation, soon spread throughout the Arab world,because of his powerful poems,especially of the tyranny of Sultan Abdul Hamid and later of British Imperialism. His chiefst work is his Diwan (collection of poetry) published in 1910. A second and much enlarged edition of the Diwan came out also in Beirut in 1932 and was republished several times. The Diwan however does not include all of Rusafi‟s poetry. He did not take sufficient care to preserve all his works. Besides this, hewrote various important books on Historical, Political and Social issues <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>people,</b> which some are published while some are in manuscript form. *Research Scholar, Department of Arabic, Assam Univers...|$|R
