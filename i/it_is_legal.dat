5|$|After the September 11, 2001, attacks, the MTA {{exercised}} {{extreme caution}} regarding anyone taking photographs or recording video inside {{the system and}} proposed banning all photography and recording in a meeting around June 2004. However, due to strong response from {{both the public and}} from civil rights groups, the rule of conduct was dropped. In November 2004, the MTA again put this rule up for approval, but was again denied, though many police officers and transit workers still confront or harass people taking photographs or videos. However, on April 3, 2009, the NYPD issued a directive to officers stating that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>legal</b> to take pictures within the subway system so long as it is not accompanied with suspicious activity.|$|E
5|$|Because {{they serve}} {{alcoholic}} beverages, casino nightclubs {{are prohibited from}} offering full nudity. In 2013, Trump Taj Mahal opened the nation's first casino strip club, featuring scantily clad dancers.

5|$|During oral argument, Justice Antonin Scalia {{responded to}} this by {{suggesting}} that some interests a person might express, such as recreational drugs, signified a willingness to violate social norms {{regardless of whether the}} conduct was illegal or not. Paul Larkin, who appeared for the government, had to admit to that there was no case law on entrapment where something that had previously been permitted was now prohibited. At one point, trying to argue that Jacobson did not have access to the defense of entrapment by estoppel (where the government persuades an actor that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>legal</b> to do something, only to prosecute them for it), Scalia told Larkin he'd lost him.|$|E
5|$|Federal law prohibits {{alcoholic}} beverages from being shipped through the mail. New Jersey effectively prohibits the shipment {{of beer and}} spirits to customers by requiring a liquor license to transport alcohol, but not having any class of liquor license that grants permission to ship beer or spirits. United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express will ship wine to a person's home, but will only deliver beer or hard liquor to a licensed business. Although uncommon, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>legal</b> for a liquor store to deliver {{alcoholic beverages}} by car or van to a person's home. ABC regulations mandate that the alcoholic beverages being delivered are paid for in advance, that they are received by someone 21 or older, and that they take place when the licensed establishment is permitted to be open.|$|E
5|$|The western jackdaw {{is one of}} a {{very small}} number of birds that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>legal</b> to use as a decoy or to trap in a cage in the United Kingdom. The other pest species that can be {{controlled}} by trapping are the crow, jay, magpie and rook. An authorised person must comply with the requirements of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and does not need to show that the birds were a nuisance before trapping them. As of 2003 the western jackdaw was listed as a potential species for targeted hunting in the European Union Birds Directive, and hunting has been encouraged by German hunting associations. Permission to shoot western jackdaws in spring and summer exists in Cyprus as they are thought (incorrectly) to prey on gamebirds.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the state, federal {{agencies}} which allow alcohol sales {{do not have}} a system of liquor licenses or alcoholic beverage control boards, but instead simply award contracts to business per federal procurement laws. New Jersey does not consider municipal ordinances to be criminal offenses, and so open container laws cannot be enforced in federal enclaves under the Assimilative Crimes Act. Public consumption of alcohol is allowed on federal lands, except when in an automobile, or when the park superintendent has prohibited open containers in an area.
