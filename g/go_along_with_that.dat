25|$|McNabb's 2005 {{season began}} with turmoil and ended {{on the injured}} reserve list. While not {{speaking}} with his main target, Terrell Owens, and all the distractions {{that came with the}} Owens controversy, McNabb was named the NFC's Player of the Month for September. That month, McNabb threw for 964 yards, eight touchdowns and only two interceptions in three games, leading the Eagles to a 2-1 record. McNabb carried that momentum into October as he went 33-for-48 (68.8 completion percentage), threw for 369 yards and three touchdowns en route to leading the Eagles to a memorable come-from-behind victory at an unfriendly Arrowhead Stadium against the Kansas City Chiefs. McNabb could not keep the momentum rolling, however, as the Eagles lost four straight games. Over that span, McNabb posted a quarterback rating higher than 72 only once, on November 6, at the Washington Redskins. After playing with a sports hernia and sore thumb, McNabb's season was finally over after a disastrous effort at home on November 14 on Monday night against the rival Dallas Cowboys. McNabb was intercepted by Roy Williams {{towards the end of the}} game, and tried to tackle the defender when Scott Shanle came in and tackled McNabb to the ground. McNabb had injured his groin on the play and was placed on the injured reserve list later that week. Mike McMahon replaced him at quarterback, and went 2–5 as a starter, with the Eagles finishing the season with a 6–10 record overall. Though low for his standards, McNabb put up respectable numbers in 2005. In nine games, he threw for 2,507 yards, 16 touchdowns and nine interceptions. To <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> he completed 59.1% (211-357) of his passes. Prior to his season-ending injury, McNabb was on pace to throw for 4,457 yards, which would have easily eclipsed his career high of 3,875, set in 2004.|$|E
50|$|Harkness {{learning}} can vary, most notably between humanities {{subjects such as}} English and history and technical subjects such as math or physics. There are general principles and goals, however, that <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> method regardless of subject matter. The main goal is {{to encourage students to}} come up with ideas of their own, learn good reasoning and discussion skills. Depending on style, the teacher may interact very little, interjecting only to guide the discussion.|$|E

5000|$|It's kind {{of about}} older relationships, yeah. Before I did the solo thing, I {{was in a}} band here in Tampa and we played here {{for a couple of}} years. And then I decided to go solo and got signed to the label. There's a certain amount of drama <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> you know. Being in a band is hard, and {{breaking}} up a band is hard because it's like breaking up a relationship. So some of [...] "Out Of The Dark" [...] is about what I was going through in relation to that. Matt Hires ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{band was}} founded {{around the end}} of 1978, when they began their career as a German punk rock band; later they were {{ascribed}} to the Neue Deutsche Welle (NDW) movement, though their music is not typical of the NDW genre. It was influenced heavily by punk rock music, and their lyrics were often critical of politics and society. The members viewed themselves as punks, whose only association with the NDW was that they appeared at the same time. As testament to that, they wrote on their homepage: [...] "Ja wir haben den Scheiß eben mitgemacht!" [...] (Yeah, we <b>went</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> shit).|$|R
500|$|The {{price of}} Altair BASIC to {{customers}} who purchased additional memory and I/O boards from MITS was $75. Users may have <b>gone</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> if the memory board were reliable. Customers bought the computer from MITS, and working memory from companies like Processor Technology. Rather than pay $500 for BASIC, they would acquire bootleg {{copies of the}} software. Only about {{ten percent of the}} early customers actually purchased BASIC. With a royalty due of $30 per copy, Gates felt that the computer hobbyist were stealing money from him. In February 1976 Bill Gates, [...] "General Partner, Micro-Soft", wrote an [...] "Open Letter to Hobbyists" [...] that was sent to every computer publication insinuating that the hobbyists were thieves.|$|R
5000|$|On October 22, 2013, when CNBC's Squawk Box {{showed a}} picture of Senator Ted Cruz, senior {{economics}} reporter Steve Liesman said, [...] "There he is! There he is! Can we get some music to <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> some Mexican music maybe?" [...] Because Cruz is of Cuban descent, the remarks were construed as racist and stereotypical. The next day TruthRevolt launched a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #StopRacismAgainstCruz urging Liesman to apologize for his comments, which he did one day later on the CNBC website.|$|E
5000|$|Well, what I meant {{really was}} {{that some of the}} fears of street crime and some of the {{stereotypes}} that <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> were responses that I think many people feel. She's not extraordinary in that regard. She is somebody that I love as much as anybody. I mean, she has literally helped to raise me. But those are fears that are embedded in our culture, and embedded in our society, and even within our own families, even within a family like mine that is diverse.|$|E
50|$|Next {{when the}} brethren neither would not <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> they sent some inside who should hinder them {{in reading the}} holy writ in our friary. Therefore, the {{brothers}} quieted their voices when reading the scriptures aloud. They in this way lessened the evil against them but they continued, though, with the readings at the usual times. Though they (the citizens) often sent people {{to keep an eye}} on them so that they would not in another way be able to read the holy lessons or preach in our friary.|$|E
50|$|The other monks went to Lund, but the {{two were}} {{released}} from prison {{on the condition that}} they attend their heretic lessons.

The Almighty and All-Powerful God have compassion over him because of his boundless kindness. To God be the honour and a glory for this and the blessing rich works he has done toward us and toward all his creations from the beginning of creation until the hour when he will gather them again and for all things and for every single thing given us and gives them back again in eternity.

50|$|The Montreal Canadiens {{defeated}} the defending Stanley Cup champion Ottawa Senators 5-2 in a two-game total-goals series. Out west, the PCHA second place Vancouver Maroons {{defeated the}} first place team (Seattle Metropolitans) also.

5000|$|Ziva's {{relationship}} with Ray Cruz {{was last seen}} in the episode [...] "Pyramid" [...] back in season 8. [...] "Ray is coming off of a long assignment, and there are professional things going on with him, and personal things going on with him, and it’s all going to get dealt with and come to a head in this episode". As for Tony, [...] "he wants Ziva to be happy. [...] "He’s protective of her and cares about her and has feelings for her, and, {{at the end of}} the day, wants to make sure that she’s safe and happy with the direction of her life.

5000|$|The {{showing of}} {{slaughterhouse}} footage was controversial. Some {{members of a}} test audience in Staten Island, New York, branded it as propaganda. [...] "Richard and I were accused of making a propaganda film for the vegetarian movement. We were accused of showing 'horrors that are impossible to watch,'" [...] Friedberg recalls. But he felt the graphic footage was necessary. In contrasting his film with the more sanitized versions produced by the kosher meat industry, Friedberg stated: [...] "To celebrate Judaism by depicting the assembly-line process by which animals are miraculously and happily turned into food for the Shabbat table without depicting the brutal cruelty and suffering <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> process makes {{a mockery of the}} real meaning of our faith."

50|$|Both {{rounds of}} the Stanley Cup playoffs were {{scheduled}} to be played on the NHL winner's home ice, with Montreal having to face both the PCHA and the WCHL champions. However, Canadiens owner Leo Dandurand claimed that Calgary and Vancouver were inferior to his. He therefore wanted the two western teams to face off against each other, and then have the Canadiens play the winner in the final round. PCHA President Frank Patrick refused to <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> idea and instead proposed a compromise in which the host team's (Montreal's) customary contribution towards the two other clubs' travel expenses would be cut in half.|$|E
50|$|He had strict {{ideas on}} fiddle {{accuracy}} and playing techniques, {{and on what}} constituted a Northumbrian style.He said that formerly, traditional fiddlers would play with the fiddle on the shoulder, rather than under the chin - in particular he stated that Whinham played in this way. The piper Adrian D Schofield, who knew him well, recalls that he used the 'Newcastle' style of bowing, where the bow-strokes go across the beat; he used only the top 3 inches of his bow to get the articulation needed. He also considered Honeyman's Strathspey, Reel and Hornpipe Tutor to be wrong in its teaching of this style. When playing fiddle along with smallpipes, he preferred to play more staccato, to <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> instrument's articulation.|$|E
5000|$|The public general {{reaction}} {{was one of}} entertainment and approval. Jerry Tallmer of the Downtown Express wrote of Mailer [...] "at his thoughtful best", and watching the film was [...] "...for all these laughs. Jill Johnston and all these lesbians ganging up on Norman". Mark Holcomb of The Village Voice indicated the modern need for such a movement and the intensities that <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> movement, saying, [...] "... what finally makes Town Bloody Hall so compelling - and unsettling - is the impression that such serious spirited debate {{is a thing of}} the past". Referred to as a [...] "battle of the sexes" [...] in Variety Magazine, the film was acknowledged as one of great societal and activist influences on women's liberation at the time.|$|E
50|$|A lack of {{motivation}} {{has been reported in}} 25-50% of patients with Alzheimer's disease. While depression is also common in patients with this disease, aboulia is not a mere symptom of depressions because {{more than half of the}} patients with Alzheimer's disease with aboulia do not suffer from depression. Several studies have shown that aboulia is most prevalent in cases of severe dementia which may result from reduced metabolic activity in the prefrontal regions of the brain. Patients with Alzheimer's disease and aboulia are significantly older than patients with Alzheimer's who do not lack motivation. <b>Going</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> the prevalence of aboulia increased from 14% in patients with a mild case Alzheimer's disease to 61% in patients with a severe case of Alzheimer's disease, which most likely developed over time as the patient got older.|$|R

50|$|Another {{aspect of}} {{emergency}} management efforts has been tasked to the CDC, which formed the Emergency Operations Center (EOC). This branch is staffed by CDC public health respondents to better enhance communication and organize responses to disasters requiring their assistance. To <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> the CDC also created the Incident Management System (IMS), a group structured by protocols, support, {{and services to}} incidents the CDC responds to. All of these groups combined form the CDC's Emergency Management Program (EMP). This group responds {{to a wide variety}} of events such as outbreaks of diseases and respiratory illness, natural disasters, man-made disasters, and events where national security is in jeopardy. Not only does this group operate in the United States, but it has also been implemented in Japan, Haiti, the Middle East, Etc.|$|E

Although Goldberg was later released when Elizabeth could not keep her story straight, he would not make it back to the arena in time to compete against Nash; it was noted in The Death of WCW by R.D.

5000|$|Samak Sundaravej {{ended his}} {{campaign}} to regain his position on 12 September 2008. Mr Samak's decision was revealed on 11 September by Theerapol Nopparampa, his close aide, after he spent about 50 minutes meeting Mr Samak at his home and he told AP that Samak told him to tell [...] "every reporter {{that he is going}} to step down from being the party leader and he will not accept the prime ministership." [...] The ruling People's Power Party said earlier it was abandoning its bid to install Samak back in power. The announcements raise hopes of ending a political crisis buffeting the country. Leaders of the People Power Party had said since Tuesday that they would seek to restore Samak, but they need to convince five other parties in the coalition to <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> choice.

50|$|At Andru Air Force Base, Max Modell {{has been}} {{confirmed}} to monitor {{the launch of the}} rocket that John Jameson will be piloting. Max and John tell J. Jonah Jameson and Marla that Peter Parker will be in attendance. When it comes to the day of the launch, Max Modell was present when Alistair Smythe unleashes the Spider-Slayers on the launch site. During Spider-Man's fight with Scorpion, Max Modell makes contact with John Jameson who tells him that the shuttle is out of control. Max Modell later talks to Peter Parker about his connection to Spider-Man where he thinks that Peter Parker is the one who makes Spider-Man's technology. Spider-Man <b>goes</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> claim. As Peter Parker finishes the device that would negate the Spider-Slayers' sixth sense, Max tells Peter that Spider-Man would lose his enhanced senses if he is in the device's blast radius when it explodes.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{conflicting}} common stereotypes {{in accordance}} to employment that male Hispanics/Latinos tend to fall into: that of a manual labor worker or an unemployed/lazy citizen. Many Hispanic/Latino Americans have equally as much education and skill level, but are seen as 'hard labor workers' such as farm hands, gardeners, cleaners, etc. This stereotype <b>goes</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> of the immigrant in believing all Hispanics/Latinos only work in hard labor fields and manual labor {{because they are not}} in the country legally which is false. Latin Americans are also often pictured as not strongly inclined to work hard despite the conflicting stereotype of working manual labor jobs. Today, negative stereotypes against certain ethnic groups about low cognitive abilities exist in many world regions, including stereotypes about people with a Latino background in the US. The stereotype creates a standard of thinking that alienates Hispanic/Latinos from having as many job and education opportunities because they are viewed as less than.|$|R

5000|$|Michael Britto {{strives to}} create art {{that is both}} {{politically}} and culturally aware {{in order to make}} statements and spark conversations. [...] "Much of my work is about being a person of color in America, and the misconceptions and assumptions that <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> My art allows me to make people more politically and culturally aware, by using the customary as metaphor." [...] His art is always made with purpose, “Why make art if you’re {{not going to make a}} statement?” says Britto. Furthermore, he uses multiple mediums including photography, video, collage, sculpture, and performance to create art that activates change. His work looks to make viewers uncomfortable, because it forces them to confront racial injustice. His goal is to break stereotypes, to force people to stop ignoring the presence of racism, to give a voice to alienated communities, and to help the mainstream community gain a better understanding of these issues.|$|E
50|$|Another {{technique}} of behaviour therapy involves holding a client or patient accountable of their behaviours {{in an effort}} to change them. This is called a contingency contract, which is a formal written contract between two or more people that defines the specific expected behaviours that you wish to change and the rewards and punishments that <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> behaviour. In order for a contingency contract to be official it needs to have five elements. First it must state what each person will get if they successfully complete the desired behaviour. Secondly those people involved have to monitor the behaviours. Third, if the desired behaviour is not being performed in the way that was agreed upon in the contract the punishments that were defined in the contract must be done. Fourth if the persons involved are complying with the contract they must receive bonuses. The last element involves documenting the compliance and noncompliance while using this treatment in order to give the persons involved consistent feedback about the target behaviour and the provision of reinforcers.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding Bruce's {{beginning}} of vigilantism, McKenzie explained that [...] "We are definitely leaning into Bruce, having learned {{some of the}} skills to be a vigilante, now actually attempting it. Now, we have a long, {{long way to go}} before he can realistically be Batman, so there will be many stumbles and falls - and regressions back to being a kid at times - but Gordon will eventually become aware of what he's doing and that will bring them against each other." [...] David Mazouz also added, [...] "Bruce really is taking on this vigilante persona and all the things that <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> Whether it be creating another persona, a public persona, that's also definitely going to be a major part of Bruce's journey this year. His relationship as this other person. Batman is coming. Absolutely." [...] Mazouz also stated that he was worried the writers could pull back some aspects from Batman, deeming it [...] "too fast" [...] but he was glad it didn't stop.
