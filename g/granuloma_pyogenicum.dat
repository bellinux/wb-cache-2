40|$|A {{comparison}} {{has been}} made between two vasoformative lesions, Kaposi's sarcoma and <b>granuloma</b> <b>pyogenicum,</b> as they are encountered in Uganda. Both are predominantly skin lesions arising in the distal extremities, may resemble each other clinically, and are widespread in their distribution in Ugandan communities. They bear a reciprocal relationship {{to each other as}} regards age and sex incidence, Kaposi's sarcoma being mainly a disease of adult males and <b>granuloma</b> <b>pyogenicum</b> a disease of immature males and females. Histologically there are many similarities between them, the essential difference being the presence of a spindle-cell sarcomatous element in Kaposi's sarcoma. The clinical behaviour reflects this difference in that <b>granuloma</b> <b>pyogenicum</b> develops quickly and appears to be self-limiting, while Kaposi's sarcoma is slowly progressive and shows much less tendency to regress...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Granuloma</b> <b>pyogenicum</b> (GP) is {{a common}} {{vascular}} lesion which often bleeds easily {{during most of the}} treatment modalities. A number of pyogenic granulomas often recur after such treatment. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} establish a surgical procedure which is easy to operate, less invasive, minimal bleeding at the operation site and without any recurrence of the lesion. Methods: Twenty-three patients (15 males, and 8 females) suffering from <b>granuloma</b> <b>pyogenicum</b> at different stages (ulcerated, reepithelialized and resolving) and at various sites of the body constituted the sample population. In all the patients, crushing of the base of the lesions followed by shave excision and electrodesiccation of the shaved base were carried out. The patients were followed up for six months to observe recurrence, scar formation and any other complications. Results: Bleeding was practically nil during the surgical procedure in all the cases. There was no recurrence and cosmetic outcome was excellent. No complications were encountered. Conclusion: The technique is not only an alternative modality but can also be the treatment of choice in all stages of granuloma pyogenicu...|$|E
40|$|Pyogenic {{granuloma}} {{is thought}} to represent an exuberant tissue response to local irritation or trauma. It is a tissue reactional to constant minor trauma and {{might be related to}} hormonal changes. Clinically these lesions usually present as single nodule or sessile papule with smooth or lobulated surface. The size at diagnosis may vary from a few millimeters to several centimeters. Pyogenic granuloma of the oral cavity is known to involve the gingiva more commonly (75 % of all cases). Here we are describing a case of pyogenic granuloma presenting on left maxillary upper buccal gingival relation to (14 and 15) in a 38 -year old female patient.

40|$|Amelanotic {{melanoma}} (AMM) presenting as {{pyogenic granuloma}} and {{occurring in the}} vicinity of acquired melanocytic nevi is rare. Herein, we report such a manifestation in a 68 -year-old male who presented with the painful red nodule and multiple pigmented patches involving the left great toe. Histopathological examination of skin biopsy taken from the nodule with an immunohistochemical study using HMB 45 and S- 100 confirmed the diagnosis of AMM. Biopsy from the pigmented patch near the nodule showed features of melanocytic nevus. Investigative work up revealed metastatic deposits in the left inguinal lymph node with no evidence of systemic involvement, placing him in malignant melanoma Stage IIIC of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor node metastasis system. The development of AMM {{in the vicinity of}} acquired melanocytic nevi and manifesting as <b>granuloma</b> <b>pyogenicum</b> is unique in this case...|$|E
40|$|Schwannoma is {{a benign}} {{neoplasm}} of the nerve sheath origin. It {{arises from the}} nerve sheath of large peripheral or cranial nerves and occurs {{at the level of}} the subcutaneous fat layer or deeper layer. Cutaneous schwannoma occurs more superficially and usually presents as a solitary dermal or subcutaneous nodule. We describe a case of cutaneous schwannoma that presented as an erythematous pedunculated protruding mass on the left flank of a 19 -year-old female. It was clinically diagnosed as a <b>granuloma</b> <b>pyogenicum.</b> Shaving biopsy was conducted and histological examination revealed an encapsulated tumor mass containing dense, spindle-shaped cells whose nuclei are arranged back to back representing Verocay body, and a diagnosis of schwannoma was made. This is an unusual case of cutaneous schwannoma that presented as a pedunculated protruding mass. (Ann Dermatol 23 (S 2) S 264 ∼S 266, 2011) -Keywords...|$|E
40|$|The {{histological}} {{features of}} 168 lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma from 159 patients in Malawi, where {{the disease is}} commoner than elsewhere, were characteristic. All showed well-developed areas of tumour and could be grouped fairly readily into those with a mixed pattern, a predominantly spindle cell pattern, and an anaplastic group, though intermediate patterns were seen. Hyaline bodies were present in nearly all tumours of skin. The cell of origin of Kaposi's sarcoma is uncertain and possibly has multipotential capabilities. Differential diagnosis may be difficult. Clinically the lesion may be confused with <b>granuloma</b> <b>pyogenicum</b> and may also be like it histologically. The presence of hyaline bodies and deposits of haemosiderin indicate Kaposi's sarcoma. The spindle cell predominant type may be confused with leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma, or fibrosarcoma. The presence of hyaline bodies {{and the formation of}} vascular channels between spindle cells point to a diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma...|$|E
40|$|Background: Objectives of {{the study}} was to study the {{morphological}} and clinico-pathological correlation of ophthalmic lesions, to know the pattern of prevalence of ophthalmic lesions in hospital and to compare the data and other investigations with similar studies from India as well as abroad. Materials and methods: The study was carried out in the pathology department of NHL municipal medical college, Ahmedabad during 2009. Total 100 biopsies & whole specimen of tumours were obtained from patients admitted in various wards of an Ophthalmology department. Results: Ophthalmic lesions were highest (18 %) in 31 - 40 year age group. Eyelid (57 %) was the most commonly involved site. Clinical diagnosis was consistent with histopathological diagnosis in approximately half (49 %) cases. Among eyelid lesions, dermoid cyst (21 %) was highest. Among conjunctival lesions, <b>granuloma</b> <b>pyogenicum</b> (22. 5 %) was highest. Conclusion: All ophthalmic lesions removed surgically should always (without exception) be subjected to histopathological examination to establish correct diagnosis for further management.

40|$|Pyogenic {{granuloma}} or <b>granuloma</b> <b>pyogenicum</b> is {{a well-known}} oral lesion. The name pyogenic granuloma is a misnomer since the condition is not associated with pus and does not represent a granuloma histologically. Pyogenic granuloma of the oral cavity is known to involve the gingiva commonly. Extragingivally, it can occur on the lips, tongue, buccal mucosa, palate, and the like. A history of trauma is common in such sites. The etiology of the lesion is not known, though it was originally {{believed to be a}} botryomycotic infection. It is theorized that pyogenic granuloma possibly originates as a response of tissues to minor trauma and/or chronic irritation, thus opening a pathway for invasion of nonspecific microorganisms, although microorganisms are seldom demonstrated within the lesion. Pathogenesis of pyogenic granuloma is still debatable. Medline and PubMed databases were searched under the following key terms: Pathogenesis of oral pyogenic granuloma, pyogenic granuloma, and oral pyogenic granuloma. This search was limited to articles on human/animal studies which were published in English language. After reviewing the searched articles, the relevant articles were selected for the present review. Through this article, we have tried to summarize and present all the concepts of pathogenesis related to this most common and most mysterious oral lesion...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Vascular tumors show a broad {{variety of}} {{morphological}} appearances and cilinical behavior, the lesions are ranging from benign hemangiomas to intermediate lesion, which are locally aggressive, to highly malignant angiosarcoma. There {{is also the}} grey zone between true neoplasia and hamartoma, which makes difficulty in histopathological assessment. It {{is also important to}} decide the degree of malignancy as it can strongly influence the choice of treatment and prognosis. Methodology: Hundred cases of vascular tumors received at the department of pathology, medical college and SSG hospital, Baroda have been studied with a view to carrying out a histopathological analysis. Results: mploying modified Enzinger&# 8217;s classification (2001) the break up of 100 cases was as follows : 37 &# 8211; capillary hemangiomas, 26 &# 8211; <b>granuloma</b> <b>pyogenicum,</b> 15 &# 8211; cavernous hemangiomas, 07 &# 8211; lymphangiomas, 04 &# 8211; masson&# 8217;s hemangiomas (papillary endothelial hyperplasia), 03 &# 8211; epithelioid hemangiomas, 03 &# 8211; lymphangiomas circumscriptum, 01 &# 8211; cystic hygroma, 01 &# 8211; spindle cell hemangioendothelioma, 01 &# 8211; epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, 01 &# 8211; glomus tumor, 01 &# 8211; angiosarcoma. Majority of vascular tumors were benign, more common in children and young adults, most common sites were head and neck, which required only local surgical excision. Conclusion: Malignant and intermediate tumors formed as extremely small proportion of vascular tumors, which should be treated aggressively and closely followed up.

40|$|Introduction: Pyogenic {{granuloma}} (PG) or <b>granuloma</b> <b>pyogenicum</b> {{is essentially}} a capillary hemangioma on the skin or a mucosal surface which shows an exophytic growth pattern and has a lobulated appearance. The most common sites are skin (40 %) and mucosal surfaces (predominantly oral cavity, 60 %). We intend to report all available cases of PG of gastrointestinal (GI) tract, diagnosed at the Henry Ford hospital, a tertiary referral center. Patients and Methods: A retrospective review of pathological database was performed on all GI biopsies in the last 10 years using diagnostic codes and pathology codes searching for PG of the GI tract. Results: A total of 23 cases of pathologically diagnosed PG was diagnosed over a 10 year period. The median age of patients was 64 with almost equal gender distribution (47. 8 % were males, and 52. 2 % were females). The most common location of PG was sigmoid colon (65. 2 %), esophagus (17. 4 %) and transverse colon (13 %). PG presented as a polyp in 16 patients (69. 6 %). The most common indication for endoscopy in these cases was screening colonoscopy (30. 4 % cases). Discussion: PG of GI tract is rare. To date, only about 15 - 20 cases {{have been reported in}} the literature and most cases have been reported from Japan and Korea. This is the largest case series of this rare pathological lesion of the GI tract. Most cases of PG were diagnosed on an endoscopy done for an unrelated reason in our series. Hence, most cases were asymptomatic, unlike previously reported cases which were mostly associated with GI bleeding...|$|E
40|$|Backgroung. PG or <b>granuloma</b> <b>pyogenicum</b> is {{a common}} tumor like growth of the oral cavity that is {{considered}} to be of non-neoplastic nature, arising commonly as a result of constant low grade trauma and poor oral hygiene and in few instances because of hormonal disturbances. Since it is a benign lesion, choice of treatment is surgical excision with removal of underlying cause if any. A newer treatment modality using laser has been reported. Case report. A 16 -year-old male patient reported to our sector of oral medicine with the chief complaint of intra-oral painless growth since four months. Past history and medical history did not reveal any relevant information. He was taking no medication and had no history of known drug allergy. On intra-oral examination smooth surfaced and lobulated growth of approximately 1. 5 × 1 × 0. 5 cm in size was present in the palate. The lesion was pedunculated and was freely movable over peduncle. The surface of the lesion showed non-omogenous red color whereas in certain area was covered by yellowish plaque like material. On palpation, growth was non-tender, nonfluctuant, hard and fibrous in consistency. Treatment plan comprising of excisional biopsy of the lesion using an Er, Cr: YSGG laser. An elliptical incision was made around the peduncle, the lesion was lifted along with the underlying periosteum from the bone surface and removed. Hemostasis was achieved with the same laser and healing was obtained for second intention. Excised specimen was preserved and sent for histopathological examination. At 7 days recall, the gingival tissues were healthy with successful healing. Conclusion. Excisional surgery is the treatment of choice for PG. The use of laser may be a valid approach for the excision of this lesion, as it is minimally invasive and offers many clinical advantages (minimal intra-operative bleeding,hemostasis, reduced times of healing) ...|$|E
40|$|Definition: Radiofrequency (RF) induces thermal {{destruction}} of the targeted tissue by an electrical current at a frequency of 0. 5 MHz (RF). As the electrode tip is not heated, there is minimal thermal damage to the surrounding tissues, producing good esthetic results. Therefore, RF ablation {{is also known as}} cold ablation or "coblation. " Modality: It has three modes of operation: (a) Cut, (b) cut and coagulate and (c) coagulate. Therefore, it can be used for various purposes like incision, ablation, fulguration, shave excision and coagulation. Because of the coagulation facility, hemostasis can be achieved and operation becomes easier and faster. Indications: It is effective in treating various skin conditions like dermatosis papulosa nigra, warts, molluscum contagiosum, colloid milia, acquired junctional, compound and dermal melanocytic nevi, seborrheic keratosis, skin tags, <b>granuloma</b> <b>pyogenicum,</b> verrucous epidermal nevi, xanthelesma, rhinophyma, superficial basal cell carcinoma and telangiectasia. It can also be used for cosmetic indications such as resurfacing, earlobe repair and blepharoplasty. Anesthesia: The procedure is accomplished either under topical anesthesia eutactic mixture of local anesthetics or local injectable anesthesia, under all aseptic precautions. Procedure: While operating, only the tip of the electrode should come in contact with the tissue. Actual contact of the electrode with the tissue should be very brief in order to prevent excessive damage to the deeper tissues. This can be accomplished by moving the electrode quickly. Complications: Complications are uncommon and mainly occur due to an improper technique. The treating physician {{should be aware of the}} contraindications of the procedure as listed in these guidelines. Physician qualification: RF surgery may be performed by a dermatologist who has acquired adequate training during post-graduation or through recognized fellowships and workshops dedicated to RF surgery. He/she should have adequate knowledge of the equipment and pre- and post-operative care. Blepharoplasty and full-face resurfacing need specialized training at dedicated workshops/centers. Facility: The procedure may be performed in a physician&#x 2032;s minor procedure room. For advanced procedures and situations like treating certain lesions such as vascular lesions, facial resurfacing and blepharoplasty, a fully equipped minor theater may be preferred...|$|E
