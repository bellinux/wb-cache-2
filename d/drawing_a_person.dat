5000|$|Developed {{originally}} by Florence Goodenough in 1926, {{this test}} was first {{known as the}} Goodenough Draw-a-Man test. It is detailed in her book titled Measurement of Intelligence by Drawings. Dr. Dale B. Harris later revised and extended the test {{and it is now}} known as the Goodenough-Harris Drawing Test. The revision and extension is detailed in his book Children's Drawings as Measures of Intellectual Maturity (1963). Psychologist Julian Jaynes, in his 1976 book The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, wrote that the test is [...] "routinely administered as an indicator of schizophrenia," [...] and that while not all schizophrenic patients have trouble <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> <b>person,</b> when they do, it is very clear evidence of a disorder. Specific signs could include a patient's neglect to include [...] "obvious anatomical parts like hands and eyes," [...] with [...] "blurred and unconnected lines," [...] ambiguous sexuality and general distortion. [...] There has been no validation of this test as indicative of schizophrenia. Chapman and Chapman (1968), in a classic study of illusory correlation, showed that the scoring manual, e.g., large eyes as indicative of paranoia, could be generated from the naive beliefs of undergraduates.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{problem of}} <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> from a {{household}} often {{occurs at the}} final stage of a survey design, e. g. in telephone surveys, after we con-tacted the households using random digit dialing. The Kish grid gives an algorithm for this random selection. We found that, contrary to the widely held opinion, the grid is not capable of providing representativeness by gen-der and age. This misconception {{stems from the fact that}} when the Kish grid was developed in the 1950 ’s, both randomness and representativeness could be achieved using the method, due to the household structure of the USA. We show that this does not hold for today’s Hungary. Finally, we suggest a modi-fication of the Kish grid that is more appropriate for selecting a representative sample. ...|$|E

The study was designed to compare the drawings of students to their rated behavior on the Aggression sub-scale of the Child Behavior Checklist-Youth Self Report form.

One-hundred seventy, eighth grade students participated in this study by completing the checklist and <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> <b>person.</b> The results obtained did not support the claims of previous researchers that the six characteristics are indicators of aggressive behavior in students.

5000|$|Figure {{drawings}} are projective diagnostic {{techniques in}} which an individual is instructed to <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> <b>person,</b> <b>an</b> object or a situation, so that cognitive, interpersonal, or psychological functioning can be assessed. The Kinetic Family Drawing, developed in 1970 by Burns and Kaufman, requires the test-taker to <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> picture {{of his or her}} entire family. Children are asked to <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> picture of their family, including themselves, [...] "doing something."

40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> from a {{household}} often {{occurs at the}} final stage of a health survey design. In case of such designs, selection probabilities pertaining to the households are usually more or less equal.

We found that, contrary to the widely held opinion, the above design is not capable of providing representativity by gender and age. We suggest a modification of the Kish grid, {{which is one of the}} widely used quasi-random procedures. The modified grid is more appropriate for selecting a representative sample. Since the performance of the grid depends on the household structure within the target population, its modification varies country by country. Those countries are considered in which the Kish grid is regularly used in surveys...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{comprehensive}} screening instrument to assess the competencies of young children as they enter kindergarten. A broad range of intellectual, social-emotional, and physical characteristics were evaluated through parental reporting, teacher rating, and direct testing of the children.

40|$|Clinical {{tests are}} abundant, making {{selection}} of a measure {{for use in a}} research program seem deceptively simple. Since I believe that this assumption is not tenable I will offer three conceptual principles that researchers may wish to consider in the process of test selection. First, I caution researchers to carefully specify the constructs to be assessed and then begin the search for tests that measure said constructs. I began thinking about this first premise in the 1980 s when I was evaluating the validity of inferences made based on the then popular <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> <b>person,</b> house, tree, or related drawing tests used in clinical practice with young children. I discovered that these tests were considered to assess a variety of constructs ranging from intelligence, to personality, to visual-motor coordination. I read about good reliability of the test scores and found correlations between some <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> and intelligence measures in the. 50 range. In a review article I noted, however, that although this is a statistically significant correlation it is nevertheless consistently lower than the typical criterion-related validity coefficient between intelligence tests of about. 70 or higher.

40|$|The Saint Thomas Choir School is an {{independent}} school for boys in grades 5 through 8 who sing in a church choir. After a vocal audition, a candidate is seen by a school psychologist, who administers the WISC-R, the Bender, and the House-Tree-Person drawings. The Headmaster uses these results in admissions decisions. ^ This study examined how well behavior in key areas was predicted by the tests. Scores included WISC-R Full Scale, Verbal, and Performance IQ scores; Bender Developmental scores (Koppitz); Bender Emotional Indicator scores (Koppitz); Emotional Indicator scores (Koppitz) and Naglieri <b>Draw</b> <b>A</b> <b>Person</b> scores on the male Human Figure Drawings. Behavior was measured by final yearly grades; need for help from a learning specialist; need for psychotherapy; willingness to work; and choir ratings. ^ Archival data were used, with anonymity guaranteed, on 87 students in the classes of 1982 through 1990. Straight correlations {{and a series of}} multiple regression analyses were performed to determine how well outcome variables were predicted by test results, over four years. Groups receiving and not receiving academic help and psychotherapy were also compared on key variables. ^ Results indicated that academic grades for all four years were very well predicted (p 3 ̆c. 001 level) by WISC-R Full Scale IQ scores. In some cases grades were also predicted at a significant level by Bender Developmental scores (Koppitz). Need for academic help was negatively correlated with WISC-R Full Scale IQ scores. Need for psychotherapy was not correlated with any data. Willingness to work was not predicted by any data, except in year 4 only by the Naglieri <b>Draw</b> <b>A</b> <b>Person</b> scores. Success in choir was not predicted by any data, except in year 4 only by the Naglieri <b>Draw</b> <b>A</b> <b>Person</b> scores and the Bender Developmental scores (Koppitz). ^ The conclusions of this research were the following recommendations to the school: (1) to continue to use the WISC-R (or the recent WISC-III) as an admissions test, as it has predicted academic success very well in past years; and (2) to add more sensitive instruments for personality assessment to the current test battery in order to better predict student behavior. ...|$|R

Four groups of 11 young adult subjects (Anorexics, Bulimics, Type 1 Diabetics and Controls), age range 20 - 39 years, were studied by I. P. A. T. ASQ (anxiety questionnaire), I. P. A.

The Methodist Church teaches the Arminian concepts of free will, conditional election and sanctifying grace. John Wesley was perhaps the clearest English proponent of Arminianism.
