Until that time, he was {{primarily}} a third baseman, though he did play nine games at <b>first</b> <b>base</b> with the Red Sox in 2005, and 56 games at <b>first</b> <b>base</b> in his minor league career. Also in 2006 {{he played in the}} outfield {{for the first time in}} his professional career, 18 games in left field. Despite his inexperience in the outfield, Youkilis did not commit an error while in the outfield; he did, however, commit eight errors while playing the infield.|$|E
5|$|Kelly, {{naturally}} a first baseman, saw regular time as {{a second}} baseman in 1925 when Frisch injured his hand, while backup Bill Terry began playing <b>first</b> <b>base.</b> With the emergence of Terry, who requested a trade {{so that he could}} receive more playing time, and Giants manager John McGraw desiring an improvement in the outfield, Kelly was traded to the Cincinnati Reds prior to the 1927 season for Edd Roush. The Reds traded Roush due to a contract dispute. With Wally Pipp at <b>first</b> <b>base</b> for the Reds, Kelly was slated to play center field. The Reds released Pipp before the 1929 season, and Kelly returned to <b>first</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E

5|$|On September 23, 2007, however, he tore {{his right}} ACL while being {{restrained}} by Padres manager Bud Black during an altercation with <b>first</b> <b>base</b> umpire Mike Winters. Home plate umpire Brian Runge reportedly told Bradley that Winters {{said that he}} had tossed his bat in Runge's direction in a previous at-bat. After Bradley reached <b>first</b> <b>base,</b> he questioned Winters about the alleged bat throwing and subsequent communication with Runge. According to Bradley and Padres <b>first</b> <b>base</b> coach Bobby Meacham, Winters addressed Bradley with a barrage of profanity. Bradley then moved towards Winters. While restrained by Black, Bradley fell to the ground and injured himself. He missed the final week of the regular season in 2007, during which the Padres lost to the Colorado Rockies in a one game playoff for the National League wild card on October 1.|$|E

5|$|The Giants made Garko a {{free agent}} {{following}} the 2009 season, but they signed Aubrey Huff to play <b>first</b> <b>base.</b> As a result, Ishikawa spent most of 2010 pinch-hitting, backing up Huff, and entering as a defensive replacement at <b>first</b> <b>base</b> late in games. Ishikawa hit his first home run of the year on April 7, against Jeff Fulchino of the Astros in a 104 victory at Minute Maid Park.|$|E

5|$|A {{pitch that}} is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are {{recorded}} strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to <b>first</b> <b>base.</b> (A batter may also freely advance to <b>first</b> <b>base</b> if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.|$|E
