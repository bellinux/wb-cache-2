40|$|Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle {{aspiration}} (EBUS-TBNA) is a {{minimally invasive}} and efficacious diagnostic modality for lung cancer staging {{and evaluation of}} undiagnosed mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Procedure-related complications are uncommon. We herein report an infrequently described phenomenon following EBUS-TBNA in which two patients developed nodular granulation tissue at the tracheobronchial puncture site. On systematic review, we found description of such phenomena by terminologies such as endobronchial <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyp,</b> granuloma, and endobronchial mass. The endobronchial <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyp</b> {{has been one of}} the most commonly used terminologies for these; but in most cases, the classical features of an <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyp</b> are lacking. We propose the term, tracheobronchial puncture-site nodular reaction (TPNR) with further classification into granulomatous and nongranulomatous subtypes, for standardized reporting of such reactions following transbronchial needle aspiration procedures.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Inflammatory</b> <b>polyps</b> {{are common}} {{sequelae}} {{in patients with}} inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Those polyps can usually be removed with snare polypectomy. There were limited data evaluating the management of hot snare-resistant <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyps.</b> METHODS: We reported on two cases with hot snare-resistant <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyps,</b> one was a Crohn's disease (CD) patient with the polyp at the ileo-colonic anastomosis (ICA) {{and the other one}} was an ulcerative colitis (UC) patient with polyp at the pouch inlet. RESULTS: Sedated endoscopy was performed, which showed a large 2. 5 cm pedunculated polyp at the ICA in the first patient and a large 5 cm pedunculated polyp at the pouch inlet in the second patient. Hot snare polypectomy was initially attempted, but failed in both patients. Then endoscopic needle knife polypectomy was performed, which helped complete polypectomy. Both procedures took approximately 25 minutes each. The patients tolerated the procedure well and continued to do well after the procedure. The final pathological diagnoses for both patients were <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyps</b> with extensive fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic needle knife-assisted polypectomy appeared to be an effective technique for the management of hot snare-resistant <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyps...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Chymase, a chymotrypsin-like protease, is a non-{{angiotensin}}-converting enzyme (ACE) angiotensin II (Ang II) -generating enzyme. The aim of {{the present}} study was to investigate whether chymase activity was increased in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyps</b> of elderly patients with functional bowel disorder (FBD). This study enrolled 45 elderly patients with FBD and 44 healthy control individuals. Expression of chymase in intestinal mucosa was assessed using fluorescence quantita-tive polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC showed an increased number of chymase-positive mast cells in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyps</b> than in healthy intestinal mucosa (P< 0. 05). Compared with healthy mucosa, expression of chymase at the mRNA and protein level was significantly higher in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyps.</b> The frequencies of the chymase GG genotype and the G allele type were higher in the intestinal mucosa of patients with FBD compared with healthy controls (66. 67 versus 40. 91 %, 81. 11 versus 63. 63 %, both P< 0. 05). The frequency of the G allele type in the intes-tinal mucosa of the C 4 subgroup of FBD was higher than that in the control group. However, in other FBD subgroups, there was no difference between patients and controls. Based on the fact that enhanced chymase expression was observed in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyps</b> of elderly patients with FBD relative to those in healthy controls, it was concluded that chymase has a significant role in the pathogenesis of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyps</b> in elderly patients with FBD...|$|R

40|$|Heterotopic bone {{formation}} (osseous metaplasia) is rarely {{detected in the}} gastrointestinal tract. Most of reported cases are associated with malignant lesions. We herein report a case of osseous metaplasia in a rectal <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyp</b> and {{a review of the}} literature on suggested mechanisms for its aetiology. A 39 -year-old man visited our hospital with a chief complaint of melena. Total colonoscopy revealed a slightly reddish subpedunculated polyp, about 12 mm in diameter, in the lower rectum. Endoscopic resection was performed. Histologically, several foci of heterotopic {{bone formation}} were found. From the review of the literature, all of the polyps described were larger than 10 mm in diameter, 55. 6 % showed inflammatory changes, and 62. 5 % were detected in the rectum. Osteogenic stimulation was considered to be a result of the inflammatory process. As our <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyp</b> was located in the rectum, the pathogenesis could be a reactive change stimulated by the repeated local trauma, or be on a peculiar characteristic of the rectal mucosa itself...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Chondro-osseous {{respiratory}} epithelial adenomatoid hamartoma (COREAH) is {{a benign}} lesion {{of the nose}} and sinuses that is extremely rare, with only 2 cases {{reported in the literature}} to date. Case report: We present herein the third reported case of COREAH, in a 38 -year-old woman who presented with left nasal obstruction and a mass in her left nasal cavity. The mass was completely resected endoscopically. Microscopic examination showed hamartomatous proliferation of respiratory-type glands with mucinous metaplasia admixed with numerous spicules of mature bone, characteristic of COREAH. Conclusion: COREAH is a benign hamartomatous proliferation of respiratory epithelium, submucosal glands, and chondro-osseous mesenchyme. The clinical differential diagnoses for such lesions include glandular hamartoma, <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyp,</b> inverted papilloma, and low-grade sinonasal adenocarcinoma.

40|$|A 23 -year-old Caucasian {{male with}} Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF-I) {{was found to}} have a submucosal nodule at the {{gastroesophageal}} junction (GEJ) and underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection.

The dominant lesion was inflammatory/hyperplastic (juvenile-like) polyp with obliterative vasculopathy while the smaller lesion was a neurofibroma.
