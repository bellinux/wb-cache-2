25|$|The Kaman K-MAX (company {{designation}} K-1200) is an American helicopter with <b>intermeshing</b> rotors (synchropter) by Kaman Aircraft. It is {{optimized for}} external cargo load operations, {{and is able}} to lift a payload of over 6,000 pounds (2,722kg), which is more than the helicopter's empty weight. An unmanned aerial vehicle version with optional remote controlled has been developed and evaluated in extended practical service in the war in Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|Emile Berliner, an {{inventor}} {{famous for his}} invention of the flat gramaphone record, had experimented with <b>intermeshing</b> helicopters as early as 1907. The initial design was underpowered {{and called for a}} lighter engine. Berliner developed a 36hp five cylinder rotary engine with the Adams-Farwell Company from Dubuque, Iowa, producing the first rotary engine used for aircraft. Berliner later spun off the Gyro Motor Company from this work. A test rig was flown in 1908, followed by two other upgrades before Berliner focused on his other businesses.|$|E
25|$|In 1947 Anton Flettner, a German aero-engineer, {{was brought}} to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip. He was the {{developer}} of the two earlier synchropter designs from Germany during World War II: the Flettner Fl 265 which pioneered the synchropter layout, and the slightly later Flettner Fl 282 Kolibri ("Hummingbird"), intended for eventual production. Both designs used the principle of counter-rotating side-by-side <b>intermeshing</b> rotors, as the means {{to solve the problem of}} torque compensation, normally countered in single–rotor helicopters by a tail rotor, fenestron, NOTAR, or vented blower exhaust. Flettner remained in the United States and became the chief designer of the Kaman company.|$|E
40|$|Regarding {{straightening}} unit as the research object, considered the different of roller spacing, {{a mathematical model}} of <b>intermesh</b> schedule suitable to the 2800 seven-roller strong heavy plate straightening machine was deduced by the geometric method. According to the mathematical model, the <b>intermesh</b> schedules of several specifications of plate were calculated, and the finite element model of straightening process {{was established in the}} finite element analysis software Abaqus. By analysing, it was found that those plates after straightening cannot meet the requirement of flatness, due to the existence of the work hardening. The bending deflection of the last {{straightening unit}} was modified and the new calculation formula of <b>intermesh</b> schedule was obtained. The values of the modified coefficients were determined by the finite element method. The <b>intermesh</b> schedules of other specifications of plate were calculated by the modified calculation formula and then verified it in Abaqus. The simulation results showed that those plates after straightening meet the requirement of flatness. So, the research results provide a theoretical basis for development of a new plate straightening machine and formulation of <b>intermesh</b> schedule...|$|R

500|$|Over {{a series}} of {{tethered}} and free-flying test flights lasting up to 43 minutes, the HZ-1 suffered a pair of accidents. Both crashes occurred under similar conditions – the contra-rotating rotors intermeshed and collided, the blades shattering, causing an immediate loss of control resulting in a crash. Aerodynamic testing was conducted in the full-scale wind tunnel at the Langley Research Center, and {{it was discovered that}} the Aerocycle's forwards speed was limited by an uncontrollable pitching motion, but rotor-tip clearance was always sufficient. The inability to determine the precise cause of the <b>intermeshing,</b> combined {{with the fact that the}} [...] "personal lifting device" [...] concept was failing to live up to its expectations, led to the decision to terminate the project.|$|E
500|$|The XBTM-1 was a low-wing, {{all-metal}} monoplane with folding {{wings to}} allow more compact storage in carrier hangar decks, and conventional landing gear. Its fuselage was an oval-shaped stressed-skin semi-monocoque with the single-seat cockpit and its teardrop-shaped [...] canopy positioned just aft of the air-cooled engine. Just behind the cockpit was a [...] fuel tank. The large wing consisted of a two-spar center section with hydraulically-folded three-spar outer panels. A large dive brake was positioned on {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. When closed it could be lowered for use as a landing flap or it could be split into alternating upper and lower sections, with <b>intermeshing</b> [...] "fingers" [...] for use in its intended role. It was very effective in this role, mainly due to its great surface area, but this was at the cost of the width of the ailerons, which significantly reduced their efficiency. A pair of [...] fuel tanks were positioned in the roots of the center section. All fuel tanks were self sealing and the pilot and oil cooler were protected by [...] of armor.|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{spread of}} mobile devices, the {{emergence}} of key wireless technologies, and the nomadic user and com-puting lifestyles on current networks are continuously evolving in synergy. MANETs, WSNs, and WMNs are examples of self-organizing unstructured networks that have their local communication paradigms and are opti-mized to perform under their particular physical constraints. Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) are particularly interesting because {{of their ability to}} operate in a pure ad-hoc mode or to include some infrastructural compo-nents, making them suitable for a multitude of applications. Inter-networking among the heterogeneous access networks is currently offered by the Internet Protocol (IP). However, the evolution of and the innovation within these networks is greatly hindered by the rigidity of the current Internet implementation and its lag in efficiently supporting flexible unstructured communication paradigms. To broaden the user’s innovation space and to effi-ciently embrace the characteristics of emerging networks, clean-slate architectural approaches are being pursued. In this paper, we propose <b>InterMesh,</b> a novel iner-networking platform for wireless mesh networks. <b>InterMesh</b> enables heterogeneous access networks to converge at a novel Persistent Identification and Networking Layer (PINL), providing a seamless service to individual network entities.
