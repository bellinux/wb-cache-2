[...] Bowerman sat in the stands while Taylor was {{pitching}} and negotiated the terms of Taylor's return to the Giants by signing.

2500|$|Abu Ghosh mayor Salim Jaber {{attributed}} the {{good relations with}} Israel to the great importance attached to being hospitable: [...] "We welcome anybody, regardless of religion or race." [...] According to a village elder interviewed by the Toronto Globe and Mail: [...] "Perhaps because {{of the history of}} feuding with the Arabs around us we allied ourselves with the Jews...against the British. We did not join the Arabs from the other villages bombarding Jewish vehicles in 1947. The Palmach fought many villages around us. But there was an order to leave us alone. The other Arabs never thought there would be a Jewish government here...During the first truce of the War of Independence, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to Ramallah to see my father and uncles, and I was captured by Jordanian soldiers.

2500|$|... "The Twist" [...] had {{previously}} peaked at #16 on the Billboard {{rhythm and blues}} chart, in the 1959 version recorded by its author, Hank Ballard, whose band The Midnighters first performed the dance on stage. Checker's [...] "Twist", however, was a nationwide smash, aided by his many appearances on Dick Clark's American Bandstand, the Top 10 American Bandstand ranking of the song, and the teenagers on the show who enjoyed dancing the Twist. The song was so ubiquitous that Checker felt that his critics thought that he could only succeed with dance records typecasting him as a dance artist. Checker later lamented:"...in a way, [...] "The Twist" [...] really ruined my life. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to becoming a big nightclub performer, and [...] "The Twist" [...] just wiped it out... It got so out of proportion. No one ever believes I have talent." [...] By 1965 alone, [...] "The Twist" [...] had sold over 15 million copies, and was awarded multiple gold discs by the RIAA.|$|E
