5|$|An alternative, space treatment, is <b>fogging</b> or misting to {{disperse}} a liquid insecticide {{in the atmosphere}} within a building without evacuation or airtight sealing, allowing most work within the building to continue, {{at the cost of}} reduced penetration. Contact insecticides are generally used to minimise long lasting residual effects.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Takechi {{turned from the}} stage to the cinema. Though the {{mainstream}} film industry considered Takechi an amateur and an outsider, {{he would continue to}} produce ground-breaking films sporadically {{for the rest of his}} life. Some of the innovations and trends in Japanese erotic cinema which Takechi's films pioneered include big-budgets and releases, literary and artistic aspirations, <b>fogging,</b> political themes, and theatrical hardcore.|$|E
5|$|Propagation both by {{seed and}} {{cuttings}} is difficult, reducing potential production by plant nurseries. Germination rates of soil-stored seeds {{have been found}} to increase substantially with the application of heat and aqueous solutions of smoke. The most satisfactory results from cuttings can be achieved by using tip growth, taken six weeks after the cessation of flowering, and kept under a <b>fogging</b> system for twenty weeks. Plantsman Neil Marriott recommends semi-hardened cutting material taken in spring and autumn. Roots of cuttings are brittle and easily damaged.|$|E
5|$|In August 1945, {{shortly after}} the bombing of Hiroshima, the Kodak Company {{observed}} spotting and <b>fogging</b> on their film, which {{was at that time}} usually packaged in cardboard containers. Dr. J. H. Webb, a Kodak employee, studied the matter and concluded that the contamination must have come from a nuclear explosion somewhere in the United States. He discounted the possibility that the Hiroshima bomb was responsible, due to the timing of the events. A hot spot of fallout contaminated the river water that the paper mill in Indiana used to manufacture the cardboard pulp from corn husks. Aware of the gravity of his discovery, Dr. Webb kept this secret until 1949.|$|E
5|$|It was {{considered}} {{more likely that}} Germany might employ such weapons against the United Kingdom, so four officers from the European Theater of Operations United States Army (ETOUSA) were summoned to Chicago where {{they were given a}} top secret briefing by the Manhattan District's Chicago area engineer, Major Arthur V. Peterson. They were told about possible forms such an attack might take, and what the effects and symptoms of them were, and they were given survey instruments and shown how to use them. They were enjoined to tell other officers in the theater to report unexplained <b>fogging</b> of film or illnesses with symptoms corresponding to the effects of radiation sickness.|$|E
5|$|Under Operation Peppermint, orders {{went out}} for medical {{personnel}} to report the details of any <b>fogging</b> or blackening of photographic or X-ray film, and medical officers were ordered to report diseases of unknown etiology involving fatigue, nausea, leukopenia or erythema. Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which were used to measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with the highest priority. Peterson instructed Chemical Warfare Service personnel {{in the use of}} the equipment, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance.|$|E
5|$|After this {{bout with}} the censors, Takechi vowed {{to produce a}} true, {{hardcore}} film for Japanese audiences. The result was Sacred Koya (Koya Hijiri), based on a work by Kyōka Izumi. He refused to allow the film to be censored in any way, either through cutting or <b>fogging.</b> Refusing to release the film in Japan, he did not submit it for Eirin's approval. Instead, he released it in Guam, where it played primarily to Japanese tourist audiences for several years under the U.S.'s more liberal pornography laws. Takechi's last film was another remake of Daydream in 1987, again starring Kyōko Aizome. Though it was a low-budget, independent production which again underwent censorship in Japan, it became very popular in its uncensored form in France.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{the then}} 68-year-old Takechi {{decided to return}} to film with a series of {{theatrical}} hardcore films, beginning with a remake of his 1964 Daydream, also titled Daydream. Noticing actress Kyōko Aizome in one of her nude photo magazine appearances, Takechi chose her to star in the film. Japan's first theatrically released film featuring hardcore sex, Aizome added to the controversy surrounding the film by admitting to having performed actual sexual intercourse on camera. Though, as Japanese law required, sexual organs and pubic hair were fogged on screen, the Asahi Shimbun called it a breakthrough film, and Japan's first hardcore pornographic movie. Takechi took a novel, yet traditional approach to the <b>fogging</b> by covering the forbidden areas with floating images of topless female shamisen players. Unlike Takechi's earlier Dream of the Red Chamber, the full, uncensored version of Daydream 1981 did survive, and circulated underground in Japan. This uncensored version of the film was released on video at one time in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The {{second major}} {{instrument}} was the MKF-6M multispectral camera, which carried out Earth-resources observations. An improved {{form of a}} camera first tested on Soyuz 22, the camera captured an area of 165220kilometres with each image, down to a resolution of 20metres. Each image was captured simultaneously in six bands in 1200-frame cassettes, which required regular replacement due to the <b>fogging</b> effects of radiation. Salyut 6 also featured a KATE-140 stereoscopic topographic mapping camera with a focal length of 140millimetres, which captured images of 450450kilometres with a resolution of 50metres in the visible and infrared spectra, which could be operated either remotely or by the resident crews. The photographic capabilities of the station were, therefore, extensive, and the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture had planted a number of specifically selected crops at test sites to examine {{the capabilities of the}} cameras.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} kept in metal {{containers}} that stopped radiation from <b>fogging</b> the film's emulsion. Furthermore, film carried by unmanned lunar probes such as the Lunar Orbiter and Luna 3 (which used on-board film development processes) was not fogged.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent a}} mask from <b>fogging</b> up due to {{condensation}} {{on the glass}} many divers spit into the dry mask before use, spread the saliva around {{the inside of the}} plate and rinse it out with a little water. The saliva residue allows condensation to wet the glass and form a continuous film, rather than form droplets. There are commercial products that can be used {{as an alternative to the}} saliva method, some of which are more effective and last longer.|$|E
25|$|In addition, a few species {{routinely}} climb {{trees and}} form a dominant component of canopy faunas, where they may be collected by beating or insecticide <b>fogging.</b> These {{tend to be the}} larger (>2mm) species, mainly in the genera Entomobrya and Orchesella, though the densities on a per square meter basis are typically 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than soil populations of the same species. In temperate regions, a few species (e.g. Anurophorus spp., Entomobrya albocincta, Xenylla xavieri, Hypogastrura arborea) are almost exclusively arboreal. In tropical regions a single square meter of canopy habitat can support many species of Collembola.|$|E

The saliva residue allows condensation to wet the glass and form a continuous film, rather than tiny droplets. There are several commercial products that can be used as an alternative to saliva, some of which are more effective and last longer, but there is a risk of getting the anti-fog agent in the eyes.|$|E
25|$|As {{the game}} was {{attempting}} things never before seen in a PC game, the team decided to write their own programming language. However, rather than simply having the programmers write the language, the designers and artists also worked on it, allowing a more collaboratively creative atmosphere than is usual, and facilitating the language to work specifically to accommodate {{the elements of the}} game which the designers and artists wished to achieve. Despite sniper mode being {{a major part of the}} game, with the ability to zoom up to 100x, the team decided not to employ any of the usual techniques to limit pop-up, such as clipping or <b>fogging.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1942, Peterson was {{assigned}} to the Manhattan District. He became the Chicago Area Engineer in December 1942, with the rank of major. As such, he was responsible for the activities of the Metallurgical Laboratory, which developed nuclear reactors in order to produce plutonium for atomic bombs. He briefed officers from the European Theater of Operations United States Army (ETOUSA) on possible forms an attack with radioactive poisons might take, and what the effects and symptoms of them were, and gave them instruments and shown how to use them. They were enjoined to tell other officers in the theater to report unexplained <b>fogging</b> of film or illnesses with symptoms corresponding to the effects of radiation sickness.|$|E
25|$|The {{inside of}} the ribbon was {{conceptualized}} as similar to a dense electrical storm, with tendrils of electricity <b>fogging</b> the screen. Because of the complex interplay of the ribbon elements with the ships that would be trapped within it, ILM decided the refugee ships and Enterprise-B should be CG models. To make the switch between computer-generated and motion-control passes of the physical model appear seamless, ILM created a wireframe of the physical model, with the computer-generated model's textures taken from photos of the physical model, shot in flat light with a long lens. The tendril strike that sends Kirk into the Nexus was simulated with the layering of multiple pieces of animation, including CG explosions Knoll rendered on his personal computer and a recycled explosion effect from The Empire Strikes Back.|$|E
25|$|Conceived and co-designed by Nick Bruty, MDK was Shiny's first PC game, and was {{notable for}} using {{software}} rendering, requiring a Pentium or equivalent microprocessor, rather than necessitating any GPU enhancements, despite its large 3D levels and complex polygon-based enemies. As the developers were attempting things {{never before seen}} in a PC game, they had to write their own programming language from scratch. Additionally, when in sniper mode, the player {{has the ability to}} zoom up to 100x, but the developers chose not to employ any of the standard solutions to pop-up, such as clipping or <b>fogging.</b> They also worked to ensure the game ran at a minimum of 30fps at all times on all machines. The game's original system requirements were a 60MHz Pentium, 16MB of RAM, 17MB of hard drive storage, an SVGA compatible video card, and a Sound Blaster or equivalent sound card; modest specs even {{by the standards of the}} time.|$|E
500|$|Fumigation is the {{treatment}} of a structure to kill pests such as wood-boring beetles by sealing it or surrounding it with an airtight cover such as a tent, and <b>fogging</b> with liquid insecticide for an extended period, typically of 24–72 hours.

500|$|After its release, it {{had high}} sales rates in Japan, selling {{over one million}} copies a short time after release. Its release in the US did not create as much hype as in Japan mainly because the market for the Dynasty Warriors series is smaller there, but it still sold fairly well and {{together}} with the Japanese sales, Dynasty Warriors 4 entered into the Greatest Hits charts. In its time Dynasty Warriors 4 has managed to become IGN's 5th best co-operative game on the PS2 as well. The game is criticized for being very similar to older games in the series and retaining some of the features such as the <b>fogging</b> and repetitive gameplay. Even with these drawbacks, Koei went on to release two expansions for Dynasty Warriors 4 Xtreme Legends and Dynasty Warriors 4 Empires. It had also been ported to the Xbox and to the PC as a Hyper edition. Armchair Empire commented that {{when there is a}} lot happening on screen at once, the game tended to slow down ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-1996, {{while still}} working on Mario Kart 64, Shigeru Miyamoto {{said he planned to}} make a sequel to F-Zero for the Nintendo 64. Initially titled [...] "F-Zero 64", Famitsu {{magazine}} revealed the project in mid-1997. Tadashi Sugiyama and Shigeru Miyamoto served as director and producer, respectively. Taro Bando and Hajime Wakai served as composers. Several key Wave Race 64 programmers including the lead programmer made up the in-house development team. Developed by Nintendo EAD, it is a sequel to the original 1990 F-Zero game, and was the first F-Zero installment to feature 3D graphics. The game made its debut at the Nintendo Space World event on November 20, 1997 where the public was able to play it for the first time. Soon after, IGN reported F-Zero X consistently ran at 60 frames per second. Consequently, background detail and textures were lacking as well as polygon count on vehicles which lessen more so as they pass the player. They noted that [...] " [...] hide most of the limited backgrounds with their girth and undulating nature which block out almost everything else." [...] <b>Fogging</b> effects are used to hide background shortcomings such as where the sky and ground meet.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{embarked}} on her Drowned World Tour in 2001, [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] was added {{as the second}} song in the setlist. The costumes were designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier, and had varied accessories like spiked dog collars, Swarovski crystal-encrusted bracelets and tattered tops. Michael Schimdt {{was responsible for the}} accessroies; he was sought out by Madonna and her stylist Arianne Phillips, to help with finishing touches for many of the outfits. Madonna opened the show with the punk section, wearing tattered black garments and a tartan kilt and belting out the first song, [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love". As the song ended, Madonna started with [...] "Impressive Instant", accompanied by her dancers wearing gas masks and encased in rolls of black mesh, chasing the singer around the stage. In the middle of the song, she was carried around by her dancers. According to Stuart Lenig, author of the book The Twisted Tale of Glam Rock, Madonna merged choreography with narrative in the performance, as she and her dancers crossed the stage. The 1984-style robotic movements denoted fascism with the dancers stalking and then trying to grope Madonna; in the end one dancer dressed as a robot grabbed a big hosepipe and thrust it between Madonna's legs, as it emitted fog towards the audience. Lenig deduced that this could denote both an act of achieving orgasm or urination towards the crowd. Santiago Fouz-Hernández, {{one of the authors of}} the book, Madonna's Drowned Worlds, found similarities with Madonna's exploration of lesbian cultural references from her earlier works, with the performance of [...] "Impressive Instant". The placement of the <b>fogging</b> machine between Madonna's legs were seen as symbols for the phallus and ejaculation, and was deduced as an example of the singer's insistence on masculinity as [...] "performance". The dancers ultimately get subdued by Madonna, who finish off singing the song and takes up a Gibson Les Paul electric guitar to perform the next track, [...] "Candy Perfume Girl".|$|E

2500|$|... (1973) was an {{adaptation}} of the Marquis de Sade's Justine (1791). Jasper Sharp writes that Kumashiro uses de Sade's story as a platform for criticizing morality imposed by power, with particular relevance to the censorship trial Nikkatsu was undergoing at the time with the prosecution of Love Hunter (1972). Underlying this theme, common in Kumashiro's work, Kumashiro has one of his characters say, [...] "What you accept as ethical is contrived by those in authority so they can control people." [...] Kumashiro also employs censorship {{as one of the}} stylistic devices of the film, exaggerating the <b>fogging</b> required by Japanese law by placing black blocks over large areas of the screen.|$|E
2500|$|The Associated Press {{reports that}} two PackBot ground robots from iRobot have entered unit 1 and unit 3 of the {{crippled}} Fukushima {{nuclear power plant}} and performed temperature, pressure, and radioactivity measurements. The remote-controlled robots entered the two reactors over the preceding weekend. The devices opened closed doors and explored the insides of the reactor buildings, coming back with radioactivity readings of up to 49mSv/h inside unit 1 and up to 57mSv/h inside unit 3. TEPCO officials say that the radiation data from the robots do not change their plans for shutting down the plant {{by the end of}} this year. Though more robots will be used, a TEPCO official, Takeshi Makigami, says that robots are limited in what they can do, and eventually [...] "people must enter the buildings". Robots also entered unit 2, but the probe was hindered by <b>fogging</b> of the robot's camera lens from the high humidity, over 90%, inside the building.|$|E
2500|$|The {{surgical}} treatment for velopalatal insufficiency may cause {{obstructive sleep apnea}} syndrome. When velopalatal insufficiency is present, air leaks into the nasopharynx even when the soft palate should close off the nose. A simple test for this condition {{can be made by}} placing a tiny mirror on the nose, and asking the subject to say [...] "P". This p sound, a plosive, is normally produced with the nasal airway closes off - all air comes out of the pursed lips, none from the nose. If it is impossible to say the sound without <b>fogging</b> a nasal mirror, there is an air leak - reasonable evidence of poor palatal closure. Speech is often unclear due to inability to pronounce certain sounds. One of the {{surgical treatment}}s for velopalatal insufficiency involves tailoring the tissue {{from the back of the}} throat and using it to purposefully cause partial obstruction of the opening of the nasopharynx. This may actually cause OSA syndrome in susceptible individuals, particularly in the days following surgery, when swelling occurs (see below: Special Situation: Anesthesia and Surgery).|$|E
2500|$|Hydro Thunder Hurricane {{was first}} {{unveiled}} at PAX East on March 26, 2010. It was then used {{as one of}} two mystery games for ScrewAttack's Iron Man of Gaming. [...] Hydro Thunder Hurricane was released {{as part of the}} third annual Xbox Live Summer of Arcade along with titles such as Monday Night Combat and Limbo. [...] The water was programmed for the game using several different techniques. [...] Fresnel reflections, normal mapping, ray-traced depth <b>fogging</b> and [...] depth-based foam and an adaptive LOD system were built to handle the visuals. The physics system that controls the water allows multiple types of waves such as wakes and whirlpools, and also adapts to handle different boat hulls and other objects in the water. V-hulled boats cut through waves, flat-bottomed boats hydroplane across the water, and multi-hulled boats have greater grip in the water. [...] An external audio contractor, Robb Mills, was called upon to compose the game's music. Developers also provided support for the Xbox 360 Wireless Racing Wheel. [...] A premium theme for the Xbox 360's New Xbox Experience dashboard was also released on July 15, 2010 as part of the game's promotion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} satellites, XM-1 ("Rock") and XM-2 ("Roll") {{suffered from}} a generic design fault on the Boeing 702 series of satellites (<b>fogging</b> of the solar panels), which means that their lifetimes were shortened to approximately six years instead of the design goal of 15 years. To compensate for this flaw, XM-3 ("Rhythm") was launched ahead of its planned schedule on February 28, 2005 and moved into XM-1's previous location of 85° WL. XM-1 was then moved to be co-located with XM-2 at 115° WL, where each satellite operated only one transponder (thus broadcasting half the bandwidth each) to conserve energy and cut the power consumption in half while XM-4 ("Blues") was readied for launch. Subsequently, XM launched ground-spare XM-4 ("Blues") ahead of schedule on October 30, 2006 into the 115° WL location to complete the satellite replacement program. On December 15, 2006 XM-1 was then powered down and drifted back to its original location at 85° WL, where it will remain as a backup to XM-3. XM-2 as well was powered down and remains as a backup to XM-4. This makes the current active satellites as XM-3 [...] "Rhythm" [...] and XM-4 [...] "Blues" [...] with two in-orbit spares.|$|E
2500|$|Because sniper mode was a {{major part}} of the game, with the ability to zoom up to 100x, the team decided not to employ any of the usual {{techniques}} to limit pop-up, such as clipping and <b>fogging.</b> A major technical issue was that of frame rate. Shiny felt most PC games maintained frame rate by using big pixels in low resolution, which works as long as the game is not running SVGA mode. Based on their experiences developing for consoles, they wanted to take a different approach; using small pixels in high resolution. They set a target of maintaining a constant frame rate of at least 30fps at all times on all machines, and so they simply play-tested the game multiple times. Any moment when the frame rate dropped below 30, they either removed something from that particular part of the game, rewrote the graphics code, or altered the artwork until they could get the frame rate back up to where they wanted without having to reduce the resolution or increase the pixel size. According to Bruty, [...] "We had no idea how fast we could get the engine when we started. The game would run too slow if we textured everything, so some parts were just flat-shaded for speed. We did our best to make that look like a design choice, or shadows, but it was a tricky balance." ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{not quite}} disillusionment that Pierson felt while he walked away. Perhaps he had not really {{believed}} in Leila's regeneration.

He had not even the feeling that it was his duty to try and save Leila by persuading her to marry Fort. He had always been too sensitive, too much as it were of a gentleman, for the robuster sorts of evangelism. Such delicacy had been a stumbling-block to him all through professional life.
