5|$|A Naval Board of Inquiry was convened on July 21, 1944, to {{find out}} what had happened. The {{official}} proceeding lasted for 39 days and included interviews with witnesses who were officers, civilians and enlisted men. Ordnance experts were questioned as well as inspectors who had overseen previous loading procedures. Five African Americans were questioned, none of whom were later to refuse to load ammunition. Captain Kinne's posted division tonnage results came to light in the inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition to load the most tonnage did not make for unsafe conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said so did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> talking about.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of Beethoven's hearing loss, his {{conversation}} books are an unusually rich written resource. Used primarily {{in the last ten}} or so years of his life, his friends wrote in these books so that he could <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> saying, and he then responded either orally or in the book. The books contain discussions about music and other matters, and give insights into Beethoven's thinking; they are a source for investigations into how he intended his music should be performed, and also his perception of his relationship to art. Out of a total of 400 conversation books, {{it has been suggested that}} 264 were destroyed (and others were altered) after Beethoven's death by his secretary Anton Schindler, who wished only an idealised biography of the composer to survive. However, Theodore Albrecht contests the verity of Schindler's destruction of a large number of conversation books.|$|E

500|$|The {{decision}} was praised by civil libertarians. Former President of the Victorial Council of Civil Liberties, Robert Richter QC, {{said that the}} {{decision was}} important [...] "because the pressure is to say, 'Well, do anything' if the case {{is said to be}} a terrorist case. That is unacceptable, the Court of Appeal has said it's unacceptable." [...] University of Melbourne evidence law professor Andrew Palmer said that [...] "I think that it was a little bit naive to think that they could interview somebody and gather admissible evidence... when that person was being held in conditions which were possibly oppressive... I don't really <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> thinking." ...|$|E
500|$|Australian {{police said}} that they {{believed}} that an Australian drug syndicate was behind the plan. It was soon decided that Myuran Sukumaran, not Chan, was the real leader of the smuggling plot. [...] Defense lawyers conceded that the four arrested at the airport were acting as drug couriers, but said they did {{it for the money}} to help their low-income families and because they were threatened with physical harm if they did not comply. [...] They also said they did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> transporting and did not know that drug trafficking in Indonesia carries the death penalty. Investigations closed in August 2005 and briefs handed prosecutors in Denpasar ready for trial.|$|E

[...] She said of trafficking, [...] "Everybody has seen it; they just didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> looking at." [...] She praised Obama and Congress for passage of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 and, together with Malika Saada Saar, {{executive director of the}} Human Rights Project for Girls, started the No Such Thing Campaign to end {{the use of the term}} [...] "child prostitute", saying [...] "there are only victims and survivors of child rape." ...|$|E

500|$|Conservapedia {{hosts the}} [...] "Conservative Bible Project", a project aiming {{to rewrite the}} English {{translation}} of the Bible in order to remove terms described as [...] "liberal bias". The project intends to remove sections of the Bible which are judged by Conservapedia's founder to be later liberal additions. These include {{the story of the}} adulteress in the Gospel of John in which Jesus declares [...] "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone". The project also intends to remove Jesus's prayer on the cross, [...] "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing", since it appears only in the Gospel of Luke and since, according to Schlafly, [...] "the simple fact {{is that some of the}} persecutors of Jesus did <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing.

500|$|Michael Ray Rhodes {{directed}} the episode {{as part of}} a deal with The Bronx Zoo, another television show filmed at Paramount Studios. Rhodes had previously won Emmy Awards on four occasions for his work on the television series Insights between 1981 and 1984. Wil Wheaton later recalled that there were some issues between the main cast and the director, but didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> about as he only worked for one day of the shoot. Gates McFadden described it as [...] "one of the most sexist episodes we ever had", and Patrick Stewart sought to have the episode changed to reduce those elements. Some of the production crew subsequently thought poorly of [...] "Angel One". Executive producer Maurice Hurley described it as [...] "Terrible. Just terrible. One of the ones you'd just as soon erase". Producer Herbert Wright felt that the [...] "sexual places it was dragged to were absurd".|$|E
500|$|Koechlin won The Hindus 2009 The MetroPlus Playwright Award {{along with}} Prashant Prakash for the play Skeleton Woman which they co-wrote, {{directed}} by Nayantara Kotian. The play {{is a modern}} adaptation of an Inuit folk tale about a writer; Koechlin played the protagonist's wife. It premiered at the Prithvi Theatre, Mumbai. Asmit Pathare of Mumbai Theatre Guide in his review wrote: [...] "The actors being the playwrights themselves, seemed to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing". She also co-wrote Colour Blind, a play that attempts to rediscover {{different aspects of the}} personality of Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore through his life and writings. In dual roles, Koechlin plays the Argentine writer and intellectual Victoria Ocampo (a close associate of Tagore), and a young woman who is writing a research paper on him. Aditi Sharma of Mumbai Theatre Guide calling Koechlin the [...] "star or the play" [...] noted that she [...] "really put in an effort to build her character and it shows".|$|E

500|$|... "Under the Bridge" [...] was {{slightly}} altered because it contained personal lyrics by Anthony Kiedis, and the All Saints covered {{it because they}} liked the overall sound and feeling of the recording. The All Saints version contains samples of the original recording, {{the most important one}} being the distinctive guitar playing in the beginning. The Red Hot Chili Peppers were, however, displeased with this version; Kiedis felt the cover was poorly recreated and, with the omission of the final verse, which contains the line [...] "Under the bridge downtown / is where I drew some blood," [...] it lost all personal significance. He said of All Saints' version: [...] "It was kind of funny, they looked so pretty and clean, it looked like they didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> singing about." [...] The guitar on [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] was played by Richard Hawley. The original Japanese edition of the album version features a different, more R/pop version of the song.|$|E
500|$|While the {{upheaval}} continued at Spithead, Duncan had retained {{order in the}} North Sea Fleet at Yarmouth by the sheer force of his personality. When men from his flagship, , clambered up into the rigging and roared three cheers in a prearranged signal for the revolt to begin on 1 May, Duncan initially threatened to run the ringleader through with his sword. Calmed by his subordinates, he instead assembled his officers and the Royal Marines aboard his ship and advanced on {{the men in the}} rigging, demanding to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing. So fierce was his tone that the men fell silent and hesitantly returned to their quarters except for five ringleaders, whom he admonished personally on his quarterdeck before issuing a general pardon and dismissing them to their duty. The following week, he assembled all of the men and demanded to know whether they would follow his orders: in response, the crew nominated a spokesman, who apologised for their actions, saying, [...] "we humbly implore your honour's pardon with hearts full of gratitude and tears in our eyes for the offense we have given to the worthiest of commanders who has proved a father to us". A week later, when a similar outbreak of mutiny affected the fourth rate ship, , under Captain William Hotham, Duncan again acted decisively, coming aboard Adamant as the crew rebelled and demanding to know if there was any man who disputed his authority. When a sailor stepped forward, Duncan seized him by his shirt and dangled him {{over the side of the}} ship with one arm crying, [...] "My lads – look at this fellow – he who dares to deprive me of command of the fleet". The mutiny evaporated almost instantly.|$|E

Once, while Stanford was away, Charles Crocker came through the locomotive works on a tour of inspection and saw the partially completed El Gobernador under construction. Having not been told about the project, he angrily demanded to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> up to. When told by A. J.

Judith Blakeman, local Labour councillor questioned the competence of the inspectors. Blakeman representing the Grenfell residents, said, “This {{raises the question of whether}} the building regulations officers were sufficiently competent and did they <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> looking at. It also begs a question about what they were actually shown. Was anything concealed from them.” ...|$|E

The pilots initially felt a duty reporting the objects despite the ridicule, he said, because they thought the U.S. government didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were.</b> Arnold did not assert that the objects were alien spacecraft, although he did say: [...] "being a natural-born American, if it's not made by our science or our Army Air Forces, I am inclined to believe it's of an extraterrestrial origin." [...] Then he added that he thought everybody should be concerned, but [...] "I don't think it's anything for people to get hysterical about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keegan {{made his}} maiden speech {{in a debate}} on capital {{punishment}} in March 1956, supporting Sydney Silverman's attempt to abolish hanging. He argued that abolition was not [...] "a lot of sentimental ninnies who did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing", but that instead supporters of hanging allowed sentiment to deter them from examining statistics in a proper frame of mind. However, he did want some assurance that with the abolition of hanging, there was no danger to public safety. Keegan was in a minority in the Conservative Party in supporting abolition. Silverman's Bill was passed but rejected by the House of Lords; when the Government then brought in the compromise Homicide Bill restricting the use of capital punishment, Keegan felt he could support it.|$|E

Arizona Senator John McCain criticized politicians who voted in favor of the PATRIOT Act but were outraged by the NSA spying on phone calls by saying, [...] "We passed the Patriot Act. We passed specific provisions of the act that allowed for this program to take place, to be enacted in operation. Now, if members of Congress did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> voting on, then I think that that's their responsibility a lot more than it is the government's." ...|$|E
