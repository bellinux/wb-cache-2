But it's unquestionably good escapist literature and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> rather like it if I were sitting in an air-raid shelter or recovering from flu." ...|$|E

What I meant was I am {{taking a break from}} being told what to do. ... It's cool when you look at someone and don't know whether they are at work or play since it's all the same to them. The things I've been doing for work lately have been so much fun, because it's not like work to me anymore. I've been even more 'hands on' in my management and the business side of things, and I feel more in control than ever.|$|E

2500|$|In 1937 Potter {{published}} The Muse in Chains: a Study in Education, {{a humorous}} satire {{on the academic}} teaching of English literature. G. M. Young wrote of it: [...] "if I were suddenly commissioned by some Golden Dustman to organize a new University, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> send for Mr. Potter and offer him the Chair of English literature forthwith." [...] Other reviewers thought Potter's suggestions more entertaining than practical. Potter's humorous insights into academic life were widely praised. He wrote of George Saintsbury: [...] "It is recorded that for eighteen years he started the day by reading a French novel (in preparation for his history of them)– an act so unnatural to man as almost in itself to amount to genius." ...|$|E

Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol along the procession route and they disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of Díaz and Taft.|$|E
