25|$|Although trial {{judges have}} always had the {{authority}} to exclude inappropriate testimony, prior to Daubert, trial courts often preferred to let juries hear evidence proffered by both sides. Once certain evidence has been excluded by a Daubert motion because it fails to meet the relevancy and reliability standard, it will likely be challenged when introduced again in another trial. Even though a Daubert motion is not binding to other courts of law, <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> found untrustworthy by one court, other judges may choose to follow that precedent. Of course, a decision by an appellate court that a piece of evidence is inadmissible under Daubert would be binding on district courts within that court's jurisdiction.|$|E
500|$|After {{the first}} part of the ballet {{received}} two full orchestral rehearsals in March, Monteux and the company departed to perform in Monte Carlo. Rehearsals resumed when they returned; the unusually large number of rehearsals—seventeen solely orchestral and five with the dancers—were fit into the fortnight before the opening, after Stravinsky's arrival in Paris on 13 May. The music contained so many unusual note combinations that Monteux had to ask the musicians to stop interrupting when they thought they had found mistakes in the score, saying he would tell them <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> played incorrectly. According to Doris Monteux, [...] "The musicians thought it absolutely crazy". At one point—a climactic brass fortissimo—the orchestra broke into nervous laughter at the sound, causing Stravinsky to intervene angrily.|$|E
500|$|Deng Xiaoping Theory {{was added}} to the party {{constitution}} at the 14th National Congress. The concepts of [...] "socialism with Chinese characteristics" [...] and [...] "the primary stage of socialism" [...] were credited to the theory. Deng Xiaoping Theory can be defined as a belief that state socialism and state planning is not by definition communist, and that market mechanisms are class neutral. In addition, the party needs to react to the changing situation dynamically; to know if a certain policy is obsolete or not, the party had to [...] "seek truth from facts" [...] and follow the slogan [...] "practice is the sole criterion for the truth". At the 14th National Congress, Jiang reiterated Deng's mantra that it was unnecessary to ask <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> socialist or capitalist, since the important factor was whether it worked.|$|E

50|$|Other {{built-in}} matchers include toBe, toBeTruthy, toBeFalsy, toContain, toBeDefined, toBeUndefined, toBeNull, toBeNaN, toBeGreaterThan, toBeLessThan, toBeCloseTo. The identity matcher toBe checks if {{two things}} are the same object. The condition matchers toBeTruthy, toBeFalsy evaluate <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> true or false and toBeDefined, toBeUndefined check <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> defined or undefined. As the name suggests toBeNull checks <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> null and toBeNaN checks <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> NotANumber(NaN). Precision matcher toBeCloseTo accepts two parameters and checks if a number {{is close to the}} first parameter, given a certain amount of decimal precision as indicated by the second parameter. Matcher toContain is used to verify that an element, object or sub-string is contained in an array, list or string.|$|R
2500|$|At the 14th National Congress, {{the thought}} of Deng Xiaoping was officially dubbed Deng Xiaoping Theory, and {{elevated}} to {{the same level as}} Mao Zedong Thought. The concepts of [...] "socialism with Chinese characteristics" [...] and [...] "the primary stage of socialism" [...] were credited to him. At the congress, Jiang reiterated Deng's view that it was unnecessary to ask <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> socialist or capitalist, since the important factor was whether it worked. Several capitalist techniques were introduced, while science and technology were to be the primary productive force.|$|E
2500|$|Vang {{said that}} he had studied the script {{as if it was a}} textbook. According to Vang, after the first film cut ended, Vang did not hear a {{response}} from Eastwood. When Vang asked <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wrong, other people told Vang that if Eastwood did not make a comment, then his performance was satisfactory. Vang added that Eastwood encouraged ad-libbing with the Hmong actors. Ahney Her said that she liked the improvisation work, even when she was required to translate between the English and Hmong languages. When asked if the in-character racial slurs offended the actors in real life, Ahney said that she did not feel offense. Vang said [...] "I was called so many names that I can’t say here because of how vulgar they were. It disturbed me quite a lot, but at the end of the day it was just a script." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the U.N. {{offensive}} {{moved across}} the 38th parallel into North Korea, {{it was found that}} the squadron's pilots often had to fend for themselves since the Mustangs couldn't outrun the communist jets it would encounter. [...] However the Mustang had the advantage of out-turning the MiGs and could fly lower than the jets. [...] Also the MiGs would run out of fuel in a few minutes and turn back while the squadron's Mustangs could return to flying photo-reconnaissance. The squadron had much success with a technique called [...] "Circle 10", whereby the pilots flew a ten-mile radius circle around [...] an area where enemy activity was sighted the night before. The pilots would fly in the next day and note <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> out of place; [...] the pilots of the 45th then would notify F-84 Thunderjet fighter-bomber pilots who would be dispatched to destroy enemy equipment or emplacements. Also the pilots of the 45th would often join in, using the Mustang's ground attack capabilities to shoot up targets of opportunity until the Thunderjets would come in with napalm bombs.|$|E

2500|$|Moderating Skills makes a {{group leader}} {{understand}} and regulate the unofficial roles assumed {{by all the}} group members during the discussion and use the members to help solve group problems. For example, {{the role of the}} [...] "tension reducer" [...] is to help the members to resolve conflicts and differences in order to reduce anxiety, while the [...] "task master" [...] helps the members to focus [...] on the purpose of the meeting. Group moderators must be mentally alert, listen well, and think quickly in order to have an effective group discussion. All the questions must be memorized and handy for the leader. Concluding the focus group is necessary for the focus group leader {{in order to get a}} formal ending of the session. The leader must thank the group members for participating in the session and summarize what was discussed during the session. S/he should ask <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> missed out in the summary of the session. This helps the group members to have an exact idea of what happened in the session and have something to take along.|$|E
2500|$|Friday the 13th was Nelson's {{first feature}} film, {{and when he}} went in for his first {{audition}} {{the only thing he}} was given to read were some comedic scenes. Nelson received a call back for a second audition, which required him to wear a bathing suit, which Nelson acknowledges made him start to wonder <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> off about this film. He did not fully realize what was going on until he got the part and was given the full script to read. Nelson explains, [...] "It certainly was not a straight dramatic role, and it was only after they offered me the part that they gave me the full script to read and I realized how much blood was in it." [...] Nelson believes that Ned used humor to hide his insecurities, especially around Brenda, whom the actor believes Ned was attracted to. Nelson recalls an early draft of the script stating that Ned suffered from polio, and his legs were deformed while his upper body was muscular. Ned is believed to have given birth to the [...] "practical joker victim" [...] of horror films. According to author David Grove, there was no equivalent character in John Carpenter's Halloween, or Bob Clark's Black Christmas before that. He served {{as a model for the}} slasher films that would follow Friday the 13th.|$|E
