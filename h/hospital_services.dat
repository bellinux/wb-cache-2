40|$|This study {{measured}} {{the degree to}} which customers were satisfied with the quality of <b>hospital</b> <b>service</b> they received while they were in-patients in a Connecticut hospital. The theoretical rationale for the study was based on Parasuraman et al. 2 ̆ 7 s (1985) quality of service model that is supported by related total quality models. ^ Subjects (N = 150) completed a 4 -part, self-report attitudinal instrument, the Quality of <b>Hospital</b> <b>Service</b> in which they indicated their sex, age, education, insurance status, and employment status, expectations of their hospital stay (6 -item instrument), perceptions of the medical service (16 -item instrument), and perceived social support (6 -item instrument). The Perceptions of Quality <b>Hospital</b> <b>Service</b> section of the QHS was adapted from the SERVQUAL instrument that was previously found to be reliable and valid in studies of service and retail organizations. ^ The first research question was: 2 ̆ 2 What combination of variables define the factor structure of Perceptions of Quality <b>Hospital</b> <b>Service?</b> 2 ̆ 2 A factor analysis revealed that the Perceptions of Quality <b>Hospital</b> <b>Service</b> instrument defined a one-factor structure with high internal consistency. The second question was: 2 ̆ 2 What is the relationship of the independent variables (sex, employment status, and insurance status) with the perceived satisfaction level of quality <b>hospital</b> <b>service</b> as measured by the total score of Perceptions of Quality <b>Hospital</b> <b>Service?</b> 2 ̆ 2 An analysis using 3 one-way analyses of variance, indicated that {{there were no significant differences}} among subjects within the categorical groups and the dependent variable, Perceptions of Quality <b>Hospital</b> <b>Service.</b> The third question was: 2 ̆ 2 What combination of variables, Patients 2 ̆ 7 Expectations, Social Support, age, and years of education measure the variance of the perceived satisfaction level of quality <b>hospital</b> <b>service</b> as measured by the Perceptions of Quality <b>Hospital</b> <b>Service?</b> 2 ̆ 2 A hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that the variables Patients 2 ̆ 7 Expectations and Social Support explained 50...|$|R

25|$|There are two {{hospitals}} in Windsor: Hôtel-Dieu Grace Healthcare, formally Hôtel-Dieu Grace Hospital, and Windsor Regional Hospital. Hôtel-Dieu Grace Healthcare {{is the result}} of an amalgamation of Grace Hospital and Hôtel-Dieu in 1994. The merger occurred due to the Government of Ontario's province-wide policy to consolidate resources into Local Health Integrated Networks, or LHINs. This was to eliminate duplicate services and allocate resources more efficiently across the region. The policy resulted in the closure of many community-based and historically important hospitals across the province. At this time, Hotel-Dieu Hospital does not do surgeries, nor does it have emergency room services. Its focus has moved away from traditional <b>hospital</b> <b>services</b> and provides more supportive healthcare.|$|E

This stoked public concerns that the freedoms they enjoyed would deteriorate. The sentiment, together with other factors such as the SARS epidemic in early 2003, when the government was criticised for its slow response, strained <b>hospital</b> <b>services</b> and the unexpected death toll, resulted in the largest mass demonstration since the establishment of HKSAR, with an estimated 500,000 people (out of the population of 6,800,000) marching on 1 July 2003.

There were no significant differences in satisfaction regarding patients' gender, religion and health insurance status. Older people were likely to be more satisfied than younger ones. Patients who were living in remote areas were likely to be more satisfied with the <b>hospital</b> <b>service.</b> Further studies should be conducted to confirm the five-factor structure of the scale.
