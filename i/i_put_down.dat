25|$|The vibrato {{sound is}} incredible, {{and it took}} a long time. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> the rhythm track on an Epiphone Casino through a Fender Twin Reverb without vibrato. Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to keep all the amps {{vibrating}} in time to the track and each other, so we had to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I wish I could remember exactly how we did the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E
500|$|As a teenager, Stengel {{played on}} a number of semipro {{baseball}} teams. He played on the traveling team called the Kansas City Red Sox during the summers of 1908 and 1909, going as far west as Wyoming and earning a dollar a day. He was offered a contract by the minor league Kansas City Blues for $135 a month, more money than his father was making. Since young Stengel was underage, his father had to agree, which he did. Louis Stengel recalled, [...] "So <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> my paper and signed. You could never change that boy's mind anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1913, Chabas {{stated that}} he was [...] "pained and humiliated" [...] by the {{controversy}} over September Morn, though he later expressed more positive views. He described the work as [...] "all I know of painting", and responded positively to statements {{that it was his}} masterpiece. In a 1914 interview, he explained that he had not meant to sell the painting, as it [...] "was [...] wife's favorite picture". At {{the time of his death}} in 1937, Chabas had only a single picture in his room: a reproduction of the painting, completed from memory; he had boasted [...] "If I had never seen it from the day <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> my brushes after painting it, I could make a perfect copy." [...] However, not having copyrighted the work, he did not receive any royalties from the marketing frenzy in the United States; he recalled, [...] "Nobody was thoughtful enough even to send me a box of cigars." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Indie Journal, Joseph said that when writing music he prefers {{to concentrate on the}} melody first, stating, [...] "Basically, I write from a two-person standpoint. [...] First, I let the song take hold and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> the idea as a raw emotional statement. Then I let it breathe and come back, approaching from more of an objective point of view. This allows me to rediscover the true meaning I intended in the beginning, shedding new light on how I can best represent that to the listener." [...] This same concept is explained again in a taped interview with the Government Television Network with Joseph explaining that a lot of times he may only come up with part of a melody. [...] Then he would let it rest and come back to it and see if it feels right. [...] Then he would start [...] "building around it", [...] like putting a car together - start with a frame and then start building things around it. Musically, he tries to connect a common bridge between such exhilarating feelings as performing at the Acropolis, to the emotions each and every one feels every day. [...] "In the end, a good melody will always stand the test of time", says Joseph.|$|E

While performing with her band We the Living, Rachel’s 14-month-old daughter Leah, was diagnosed as having a profound hearing impairment.

[...] No further would I read, nor did I need...|$|E

2500|$|Two omnibus editions {{were created}} by Douglas Adams to combine the Hitchhiker series novels and to [...] "set the record straight". The stories came in so many {{different}} formats that Adams stated that every time he told it he would contradict himself. Therefore, he stated in the introduction of The More Than Complete Hitchhiker's Guide that [...] "anything <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> wrong here is, as far as I'm concerned, wrong for good." [...] The two omnibus editions were The More Than Complete Hitchhiker's Guide, Complete and Unabridged (published in 1987) and The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide, Complete and Unabridged (published in 1997).|$|E

When I have thus got them all together in one View, I endeavour to estimate their respective Weights; and where I find two, one on each side, that seem equal, I strike them both out: If I find a Reason pro equal to some two Reasons con, I strike out the three. If I judge some two Reasons con equal to some three Reasons pro, I strike out the five; and thus proceeding I find at length where the Ballance lies; and if after a Day or two of farther Consideration nothing new that is of Importance occurs on either side, I come to a Determination accordingly.|$|E
