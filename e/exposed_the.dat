40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} the transcriptional expression of mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) in MGC 803 cell lines subjected by various time-phase hypoxic dispositions, and further {{to discuss the}} influence of mtDNA transcripts on hypoxic resistance to irradiation. METHODS The MGC 803 cells exposed to anoxic environment were divided into control group (0 h), hypoxic group (2 h, 8 h, 16 h, 24 h) and irradiated group after <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxia. RT-PCR was applied to detect the transcripts of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND 4), ND 5, cytochrome b (cyt-b) and ATPase 6 (ATP- 6) in MGC 803 cell lines at various time-phases of hypoxic, and after X-ray irradiation. Flow cytometry and colony formation assay were conducted to evaluate the cell cycle phase and survival fraction. RESULTS COI and ND 4 transcripts of MGC 803 cell lines were influenced remarkably by hypoxia. COI transcripts were decreased remarkably with the elongation time of <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxic, and reduced to one fourth of its original amount of pre-hypoxia 24 h after <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxia. ND 4 transcripts were increased initially, and elevated to two folds 8 h after <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxia, and then reduced to one second 24 h after <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxia. Hypoxia resulted in G 1 phase blockage, especially after hypoxia for 16 h. The survival fraction of MGC 803 cells <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxia in irradiated group showed that as <b>the</b> time of <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxic before irradiation is prolonged, the survival fraction of MGC 803 cells may have an elevated tendency. CONCLUSION The tumor cells with lower expression levels of the COI and the ND 4 after <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxic have stronger resistance to the radiation, which indicates that increasing the expression levels of the COI and the ND 4 might be advantageous to enhance the sensitivity of hypoxic tumor cells to the radiotherapy...|$|R

5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave located {{over the}} open Pacific Ocean organized into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on October 22. It strengthened into {{a tropical storm}} the next day. Shortly afterwards, wind shear increased. Lowell's convection was disrupted, and its center of circulation became <b>exposed.</b> <b>The</b> cyclone crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on October 26. The shear relaxed, and the depression restrengthened into a tropical storm. Lowell drifted in slow steering currents until it approached Hurricane Huko. The proximity of Huko caused a gradual weakening in Lowell, and it dissipated on October 31.|$|E
5|$|By September 28, the {{organization}} of the depression deteriorated further due to strong vertical wind shear. The center of the depression again became difficult to location by infrared images early on September 29. Later that day, a few computer models indicated a decrease in wind shear over the depression within two days, thus, it was predicted to strengthen into a tropical storm. However, wind shear <b>exposed</b> <b>the</b> center of the depression again by early on September 30, though it was still forecast to intensify to tropical storm status. By late on October 1, satellite imagery noted that the depression dissipated, and the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory on the system.|$|E

The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore followed shortly thereafter, developing their respective emergency medicine systems in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
