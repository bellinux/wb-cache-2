At trial, prosecutors said Gilbert used a large kitchen knife in an assault in Greenfield, Massachusetts in January or February 1988. Prosecutors said she tried twice to murder a person by poison in November 1995. Prosecutors said that Gilbert tried to poison a patient at the VA hospital on Jan. 28, 1996, and that she caused a medical emergency by removing a patient's breathing tube at the VA hospital on Jan. 30, 1994. Prosecutors said that Gilbert abandoned a patient undergoing cardiac arrest on Nov. 9, 1995, and then asked another nurse to accompany her on a check of patients. Prosecutors said she waited until her colleague independently spotted the patient's difficulty before raising an alarm. Gilbert forced an untrained colleague to use cardiac defibrillation paddles on a patient during a medical emergency on Nov. 17, 1995, by refusing to use the equipment herself. Prosecutors said Gilbert threatened the life of at least one person verbally and physically in July 1996.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 Background: The rise of {{contingent}} work {{arrangements in}} the U. S. has generated unease about the American workforce. A recent study estimated that healthcare {{now accounts for}} more than one in five contingent workers. Unfortunately, {{little is known about the}} extent contingent work arrangements may be occurring in fast-growing, low-wage supportive health occupations in long-term care such as, <b>home</b> <b>health</b> <b>aides</b> and <b>home</b> care aides. As the U. S. population ages and the healthcare sector becomes the largest employment, it is important to understand how these employment arrangements may jeopardize or support the health workforce. Objective: This descriptive study focuses on identifying occupations in long-term care with the highest proportion of contingent workers. We compare <b>home</b> <b>health</b> <b>aides</b> and <b>home</b> care aides in contingent and traditional work arrangements to determine predictors of being in a contingent work arrangement. Methods: We used data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) March 2016 Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC). Two occupational categories (nursing, psychiatric, and <b>home</b> <b>health</b> <b>aides</b> and personal and home care aides) were restricted by work setting (<b>home</b> <b>health</b> care services) to identify <b>home</b> <b>health</b> <b>aides</b> and <b>home</b> care aides. We identified workers in contingent work arrangements as those who identified as self-employed. Other responses were coded as workers in traditional employment. Descriptive and regression analyses were conducted to compare workers in different employment arrangements within the same occupation. Population weights provided by the U. S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics were used to extrapolate the findings. Results: Of the estimated 564, 528 <b>home</b> <b>health</b> <b>aides,</b> 11. 18 % were in contingent work arrangements. Similarly, 11. 22 % of the estimated 385, 973 home care aides are in contingent work arrangements 11. 22 % were contingent workers. <b>Home</b> <b>health</b> <b>aides</b> were 15. 4 % (p < 0. 05) less likely to be in a contingent work arrangement if they had a child in the household and 20. 9 % (p < 0. 01) and 15. 6 % (p < 0. 05) less likely to be in a contingent work arrangement if they were between the ages of 35 and 44 or between the ages of 55 and 64. In contrast, home care aides were 28. 5 % (p < 0. 01) more likely to be in a contingent work arrangement if they were between the ages of 55 and 64. Conclusion: This study identified <b>home</b> <b>health</b> <b>aides</b> and <b>home</b> care aides as occupations in long-term care settings with the highest proportion of contingent workers. Our results contribute to a growing body of evidence describing contingent workers in specific industries and occupations and what characteristics influence entry into alternative work arrangements. Our focus on two of the fastest growing occupations in the U. S. labor force show that contingent work arrangements affect workers who are already vulnerable to low wages and limited benefits. Our findings warrant future research on these types of arrangements among long-term care occupations...|$|R
50|$|This issue {{persists}} {{today in}} the field of economics. Acts performed in the home often carry considerable replacement costs but are not factored into productivity. It is possible to pay others to perform many of the tasks associated with care work, but to do so is often prohibitively expensive. When adding up the potential costs of work such as round-the-clock childcare, housekeeping, cooking, and the cost of a person such as a <b>home</b> <b>health</b> <b>aide</b> to provide care for elderly family members, it proves much more cost effective for families to substitute their time rather than pay the replacement cost. While paid care work is considered employment, work undertaken by family members is not counted as productive towards the economic market and is therefore overlooked when considering things such as employment status.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} <b>home</b> <b>health</b> care programs formulated in an Anglo dominated American culture {{when they are}} implemented in two settings with distinct cultural traditions, Puerto Rico and Indiana. Puerto Rico is a predominantly Hispanic territory of the United States that is subject to American national laws, and Indiana is a Midwestern state that is immersed in American culture, mostly white and culturally Anglo. Using these significant cultural differences as a starting point, this study investigates how variations in culture affect <b>home</b> <b>health</b> care programs in Indiana and Puerto Rico. The study takes note of the limitations in the policy implementation literature and addresses the scarcity of studies examining the effects of social culture on the implementation of policies and programs. The data presented {{in this study were}} collected through interviews with elderly patients, their unpaid primary caregivers, and paid <b>home</b> <b>health</b> <b>aides</b> employed by <b>home</b> <b>health</b> care programs covered by Medicare in Indiana and Puerto Rico. The research hypothesized that culture does influence the implementation of federal programs to serve the elderly when the same policies and programs are implemented in culturally different locations. Quantitative and qualitative data were used to determine differences between participants in both regions. Some of the hypotheses were confirmed, some were disproved: As expected, the data showed that (1) dissimilar cultural values influence unpaid care of the elderly in Indiana and Puerto Rico, and (2) that the elderly people in Indiana and Puerto Rico identify different aspects of the <b>home</b> <b>health</b> care program as criteria for satisfaction. The data weakly supported the hypothesis that elderly patients in Puerto Rico are more likely to feel closer to their <b>home</b> <b>health</b> <b>aides</b> and familial caregivers than their elderly counterparts in Indiana. The data also showed that (1) <b>home</b> <b>health</b> <b>aides</b> in both places behaved in similar ways toward the provision of care to the elderly, and (2) that elderly patients in Indiana and Puerto Rico are likely to be satisfied with the same qualities in their <b>home</b> <b>health</b> <b>aides.</b> ...|$|R
