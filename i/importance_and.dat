5|$|A third {{theme of}} the work is the stress on the <b>importance</b> <b>and</b> number of {{distinguished}} burials that took place at Ely. They would have increased the desire of others to be buried there, which would have benefited the community by the donations that would have flowed from those wishing to secure their burial. The Liber stresses the burials of Æthelstan, a Bishop of Elmham, that of Ælfwine, another Bishop of Elmham, and Wulfstan II, an Archbishop of York.|$|E
5|$|Another {{constant}} theme {{which runs}} throughout the Latin American dictator novel, which gained in <b>importance</b> <b>and</b> frequency during the Latin American Boom, is {{the interdependence of}} the Latin American tyrant and United States imperialism. In Mario Vargas Llosa's The Feast of the Goat, for example, Trujillo faces serious opposition shortly after losing his material backing from the CIA, previously held for over 32 years {{in light of his}} anti-communist leanings.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for combining sources of evidences with different <b>importances</b> <b>and</b> different reliabilities. Usually, the combination of sources of evidences with different reliabilities {{is done by the}} classical Shafer's discounting approach and very often the taking account of different importances of sources, if any, is done with a simliar discounting way by assimilating the notion of importance with the notion reliability. These two notions are actually different and appears fundamental in most of hierarchical Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) problems, and thus they must be treated differently. We show in this paper how this can be done and we provide simple examples to show the differences between both solutions for managing <b>importances</b> <b>and</b> reliabities of sources. We also discuss the possibility for mixing them in a global fusion process...|$|R

5|$|Unlike the Badami Chalukyan temples {{featured}} in detailed studies by Henry Cousens (1927), Gary Tartakov (1969) and George Michell (1975), Western Chalukyan architecture suffered neglect despite its <b>importance</b> <b>and</b> wider use.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to present the {{redistribution}} <b>importance</b> of premium <b>and</b> service in the health insurance. In the paper, the particular relationship between the health insurance and the public finance was shown.

The structure <b>and</b> <b>importance</b> of premium in the obligatory public health insurance was presented in the connection with the structure <b>and</b> <b>importance</b> of personal income lax.
