5|$|Although Panama and Costa Rica {{were not}} in the direct path of Hurricane Beta, storm {{warnings}} were issued for the two countries on October27 as heavy rains, up to 20in (508mm), <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> bands of Beta were possible. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Panama alerted officials in Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala about the possible impacts from Beta. Civil defence officials in El Salvador declared a pre-emptive alert due to the possibility of rain-triggered mudslides <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> bands of Beta.|$|E

5|$|This highly {{hypothetical}} {{picture of}} the flux tube exchange was partly confirmed by the Galileo spacecraft, which detected regions of sharply reduced plasma density and increased field strength in the inner magnetosphere. These voids may correspond to the almost empty flux tubes arriving <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> magnetosphere. In the middle magnetosphere, Galileo detected so-called injection events, which occur when hot plasma <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> magnetosphere impacts the magnetodisk, leading to increased flux of energetic particles and a strengthened magnetic field. No mechanism is yet known to explain the transport of cold plasma outward.|$|E

5|$|As Tropical Depression 07W, locally named 'Henry' by PAGASA, {{neared the}} provence the {{northern}} Philippines, {{a total of}} 17 provinces were placed under a storm alert as winds of 30kts (55km/h) were likely to affect areas near the depression.

5|$|In the United States, {{the threat}} of the {{hurricane}} prompted the National Weather Bureau to issue warnings of gale force winds, high tides, and rough surf <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Outer</b> Banks of North Carolina to Maine.

There, officials also closed several beaches and canceled ferry travel along the state's southern waterways.|$|E

5|$|Fausto {{steadily}} weakened {{throughout the}} following two days as it moved over progressively cooler waters. By July21, the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm and a tropical depression the next day. Early on July23, the depression lacked deep convection and degenerated into a remnant low pressure area. The low persisted for another day before dissipating over open waters. Hurricane Fausto {{had little effect on}} land, despite passing close to the islands of Clarion and Socorro where high winds, reaching hurricane-force on Socorro, were recorded. Moderate rainfall <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> bands of the storm amounted to 1.9in (50mm) in the Mexican state of Sinaloa.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{disruption}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> planets' migration {{would have}} sent large numbers of asteroids into the inner Solar System, severely depleting the original belt until it reached today's extremely low mass. This event may have triggered the Late Heavy Bombardment that occurred approximately 4billion years ago, 500–600million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System. This period of heavy bombardment lasted several hundred million years and is evident in the cratering still visible on geologically dead bodies of the inner Solar System such as the Moon and Mercury. The oldest known evidence for life on Earth dates to 3.8billion years ago—almost immediately {{after the end of the}} Late Heavy Bombardment.|$|E
5|$|Interaction between {{nanotubes}} {{or between}} a nanotube and another material may quench or increase PL. No PL is observed in multi-walled carbon nanotubes. PL from double-wall carbon nanotubes strongly {{depends on the}} preparation method: CVD grown DWCNTs show emission both from inner and outer shells. However, DWCNTs produced by encapsulating fullerenes into SWCNTs and annealing show PL only <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> shells. Isolated SWCNTs lying on the substrate show extremely weak PL which has been detected in few studies only. Detachment of the tubes from the substrate drastically increases PL.|$|E
