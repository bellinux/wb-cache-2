40|$|Sub-gingival margin {{placement}} {{is sometimes}} required due to different reasons {{and is often}} associated with adverse periodontal reactions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if a single restoration with subgingival margin on a tooth, in the maxillary anterior zone, would affect its periodontal soft tissue parameters, and whether or not a deep chamfer preparation has a different influence in the periodontium when compared to a <b>feather</b> <b>edge</b> preparation. Plaque and gingival indexes, periodontal probing depth, bleeding on probing and patient’s biotype were registered. 106 teeth were prepared with a deep chamfer, while 94 were prepared with a <b>feather</b> <b>edge</b> finishing line. Six and twelve month after the restorations delivery the same parameters were evaluated. Repeated measure one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (α= 0. 05) was used. At six months the patient A statistically significant difference between baseline and the 6 and 12 -month follow up is present in regards to plaque index, gingival index and periodontal probing depth, but no statistically significant difference between chamfer and <b>feather</b> <b>edge</b> finishing lines. There is a statistically significant difference between baseline and the 6 and 12 -month follow up in regards to bleeding on probing. <b>Feather</b> <b>edge</b> preparation presents significantly more bleeding on probing and less gingival recession than the chamfer. Sub-gingival margins do influence the periodontal soft tissue response. Statistically significant difference exists between <b>feather</b> <b>edge</b> and chamfer finishing lines in regards to bleeding on probing and gingival recession. Subgingival margins should be carefully selected, especially when <b>feather</b> <b>edge</b> finishing line is utilized...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{efficient}} no-reference perceptual blockiness estimation method based on local features and segmentation for JPEG coded images that can automatically quantify perceptual blocking artifacts. We believe that perceptual blockiness of any image {{is strongly dependent on}} local {{features such as}} <b>edge,</b> <b>flat</b> and texture. Therefore, <b>edge,</b> <b>flat,</b> and texture based blockiness are evaluated in this method. Experimental results on LIVE database show that proposed method has sufficient correlation with subjective evaluation scores...|$|R
50|$|It {{is a small}} bird (15 cm) with a long, fan-shaped tail {{which is}} often fanned or wagged. The plumage is mostly dark grey with a white eyebrow, {{moustache}} and tips to the tail feathers.

50|$|They are 18-22 cm long. The {{males have}} highly {{colourful}} plumage; bright blue with areas of purple. The blue colour {{is produced by}} air bubbles in the feathers which scatter light.
