25|$|When General Bell first {{sent me to}} Victor I {{offered him}} certain {{evidence}} {{in regard to the}} perpetrators of the Vindicator explosion, which he has failed to follow up, but which would have led to the arrest and conviction of the men who are responsible for the placing of that infernal machine. At about the 20th of January, 1904, by order of the adjutant of Teller County military district, and under special direction of Major T. E. McClelland and General F. M. Reardon, who was the Governor's confidential adviser regarding the conditions in that district, a series of street fights were commenced between men of Victor and soldiers of the National Guard on duty there. Each fight was planned by General Reardon or Major McClelland and carried out under their actual direction. Major McClelland's instructions were literally to knock them down, knock their teeth down their throats, bend in their faces, kick in their ribs and do everything except kill them. These fights continued more or less frequently up to the 22d of March. About the middle of February General Reardon called me into Major McClelland's office and asked me if I had a man in whom I could place absolute confidence. I called in Sergeant J. A. Chase, Troop C, First Cavalry, N. G. C., and, in the presence of Sergeant Chase, he stated to me that, owing to the refusal of the Mine Owners' Association to furnish the necessary money to meet the payroll of the troops, it had become necessary to take some steps to force them to put up the cash, and he desired me to take Sergeant Chase and hold up or shoot the men coming off shift at the Vindicator mine at 2 o'clock in the morning. I told General Reardon that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that most of these men caught the electric car that stopped at the shaft house so that such a plan would be impracticable. He then said to me that the same end could be reached if I would take the sergeant and fire fifty or sixty shots into the Vindicator shaft house at some time during the night. Owing to circumstances making it impossible for Sergeant Chase to accompany me, I took Sergeant Gordon Walter of the same troop and organization, and that same night did at about 12:30 o'clock fire repeatedly into the Vindicator and Lillie shaft house. Something like sixty shots were fired from our revolvers at this time. Afterwards we mounted our horses and rode into Victor and into the Military Club, reporting in person to General Reardon and Major McClelland. The next day General Reardon directed me to take Sergeant Walter and look over the ground {{in the rear of the}} Findlay mine with a view of repeating the performance there, but before the plan could be carried out General Reardon countermanded the order, stating his reason to be that the mine owners had promised to put up the necessary money the next day, which, as a matter of fact, they did. General Reardon, in giving me directions regarding the shooting up of the Vindicator shaft house, stated that Governor Peabody, General Bell, he himself, and I were the only ones who knew anything about the plan.|$|E
500|$|In January 2006, nine tracks {{recorded}} for the album were {{leaked to the}} Internet. In response to the leak, Garrett Tierney stated [...] "I would say it {{did it in a}} good way 'cause so many people were curious to hear what we have been doing—and for the most part, the record tracks don't sound anything like the leaked demos." [...] However, Lacey was not so upbeat when asked, saying, [...] "For me it was different. It had me pretty down for a while. No one likes to show their creation in mid-process, and those songs weren't done. They were like blueprints. Just the plan, right? It put me in a state where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that those songs had been wasted or something—that we had to go and write new things because those had been heard. Now, in retrospect, I want those songs to be on the album and many of them aren't, and I'm probably more to blame for that than anyone. This record already feels incomplete to me without those tracks and probably will forever." ...|$|E

The Negro musicians simply played the hits of the day...They {{followed}} the parade. Many white bands and orchestra leaders, on the other hand, were on the alert for novelties. They were therefore the ones most ready to introduce our numbers. [...] Negro vaudeville artists...wanted songs that would not conflict with white acts on the bill. The result was that these performers became our most effective pluggers.|$|E

60|$|During the {{excitement}} of the last three days, I had not bethought me of paying a visit to the Rue d'Anjou: indeed <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that General Lafayette was at La Grange, for I had understood that he only remained at Paris to attend the funeral of Lamarque.

6000|$|For instance, {{despite the}} utmost care of which I was capable, while {{studying}} up for The Coral Island, I {{fell into a}} blunder through ignorance in regard to a familiar fruit. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that cocoa-nuts grew on their trees in the same form as that {{in which they are}} usually presented to us in grocers' windows--namely, {{about the size of a}} large fist with three spots, suggestive of a monkey's face, at one end. Learning from trustworthy books that at a certain stage of development the nut contains a delicious beverage like lemonade, I sent one of my heroes up a tree for a nut, through the shell of which he bored a hole with a penknife and drank the [...] "lemonade"! It was not till long after the story was published that my own brother--who had voyaged in Southern seas--wrote to draw my attention to the fact that the cocoa-nut is nearly as large as a man's head, and its outer husk over an inch thick, so that no ordinary penknife could bore to its interior! Of course I should have known this, and, perhaps, should be ashamed of my ignorance--but, somehow, I'm not! ...|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR MOTHER AND SISTER,--Ma, {{you have}} given my vanity a deadly thrust. Behold, I am prone to boast of having the widest reputation, as a local editor, of any man on the Pacific coast, and you gravely come forward and tell me [...] "if I work hard and attend closely to my business, I may aspire to a place on a big San Francisco daily, some day." [...] There's a comment on human vanity for you! Why, blast it, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that I could get such a {{situation}} as that any time I asked for it. But I don't want it. No paper in the United States {{can afford to pay}} me what my place on the [...] "Enterprise" [...] is worth. If I were not naturally a lazy, idle, good-for-nothing vagabond, I could make it pay me $20,000 a year. But I don't suppose I shall ever be any account. I lead an easy life, though, and I don't care a cent whether school keeps or not. Everybody knows me, and I fare like a prince wherever I go, be it {{on this side of the}} mountains or the other. And I am proud to say I am the most conceited ass in the Territory.|$|E
