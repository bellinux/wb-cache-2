40|$|This master thesis report {{describes}} {{the development of}} a physically based model which can predict the coolant temperature of an internal combustion engine during its warm-up phase. The model is used to detect if the thermostat in the cooling system is functioning correctly which is a requirement for present day On-Board Diagnostics II (OBD II). The model uses information available within the Engine Control Unit (ECU) and needs little calibration work. Thereby, the model can easily be extended with extra features to remain applicable with future power train applications. The temperature prediction capability has been tested for steady state conditions as well as for ”real-world” driving and regulated driving cycles, thereby the model has been tested on a vehicle with a start-stop system. The model includes a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>function</b> which is performed at the most accurate prediction of the model. The sensitivity of the temperature prediction to sensor input errors and varying parameters (like fuel quality) has been investigated in a sensitivity study. Finally, a threshold value is proposed for the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>function</b> by determining when an invalid faulty thermostat is detected or a faulty thermostat is not detected...|$|E

50|$|The DDEC {{system was}} {{particularly}} easy to operate, and <b>diagnostic</b> <b>functions</b> {{were able to}} be displayed to the driver. Typically there are two indicator lights, one in yellow and one in red. The red indicator represents a significant engine fault, {{and in most cases}} the engine will automatically shut down to protect the engine from damage. The yellow light represents a minor fault, and was more of a cautionary function to alert the operator to a fault that might not be dangerous, or represent immediate damage to the engine. The operator is able to gain basic <b>diagnostic</b> <b>functions</b> via these two lights also. Accompanying the two lights there generally is a switch; when pressed in specific circumstances, the red and yellow lights will flash in a specific order and the operator is able to calculate a fault code, and know the specific problem with the engine.|$|R

30|$|On {{the basis}} of these studies, {{researchers}} have proposed and have been developing an affect sensitive pedagogical agents (Arroyo et al. 2011; Sarrazfadeh et al. 2014) and an intelligent mentoring system (IMS) that supports learning activities from both knowledge and mental states (Kojima et al. 2012; Muramatsu et al. 2012; Muramatsu et al. 2013). One of its main characteristics is the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>function</b> of the learner model considering the mental states of learners. Because mental states can instantly change in a short activity (e.g., solving of a single problem), the IMS is required to monitor learners at all times and to give feedback based on diagnosis. The IMS provides integrative learning support including real-time estimation of learners’ mental states and a selection of ways to support learners, in addition to a diagnosis of learners’ knowledge structures and determination of teaching strategies provided by the ITS.|$|E

40|$|A simple {{theoretical}} {{framework for the}} description and interpretation of spatially correlated modelling residuals is presented, and the resulting tools are found to provide a useful aid to model selection {{in the context of}} weak gravitational lensing. The description is focused upon the specific problem of modelling the spatial variation of a telescope point spread function (PSF) across the instrument field of view, a crucial stage in lensing data analysis, but the technique may be used to rank competing models wherever data are described empirically. As such it may, with further development, provide useful extra information when used in combination with existing model selection techniques such as the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria, or the Bayesian evidence. Two independent <b>diagnostic</b> correlation <b>functions</b> are described and the interpretation of these functions demonstrated using a simulated PSF anisotropy field. The efficacy of these <b>diagnostic</b> <b>functions</b> as an aid to the correct choice of empirical model is then demonstrated by analyzing results for a suite of Monte Carlo simulations of random PSF fields with varying degrees of spatial structure, and it is shown how the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>functions</b> can be related to requirements for precision cosmic shear measurement. The limitations of the technique, and opportunities for improvements and applications to fields other than weak gravitational lensing, are discussed. Comment: 18 pages, 12 figures.

The deviation of temperature measurements from their average value {{is treated as}} the noise input data, then the noise data is filtered through the Butterworth filter. The power spectrum density estimation of the noise data is obtained by using the Welch method. The first-order characteristic of the temperature sensor is used to obtain the characteristic frequency of the sensor, which can then {{be used to determine}} the working status of the sensor. Finally, through a large number of experiments, the results have shown that the sensor&# 39;s characteristic frequency in a failure condition is significantly higher than that in the normal state. So it verifies the feasibility of on-line diagnosis by using the noise analysis approach for the temperature sensor.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} {{investigation of a}} turbulent boundary layer flow at a significant adverse pressure gradient at Reynolds number Re-theta= 10000 using large field PIV. The testcase is designed to start from a zero pressure gradient flow at Re-theta= 8000 with a distinct log-law region following a slowly rising adverse pressure gradient. This allows to reveal {{a breakdown of the}} log-law under the effect of the adverse pressure gradient. The region described by the log-law is progressively reduced in terms of y+ and then joins into a modified log-law which gives a good fit to the data up to at least y/delta 99 = 0. 2. The scaling in the overlap region is demonstrated using the mean velocity slope <b>diagnostic</b> <b>function,</b> enabled due to the high quality of the PIV data. Locally, the velocity profile is measured down to the wall using long-range microscopic PIV with a particle tracking velocimetry to determine the wall shear stress directly in the adverse pressure gradient region...|$|E
