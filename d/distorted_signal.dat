40|$|Abstract- This paper {{proposes a}} power quality {{disturbance}} classification technique {{based on the}} energy of the <b>distorted</b> <b>signals.</b> The multiresolution analysis technique of DWT is employed on the <b>distorted</b> <b>signals</b> to extract the energy distribution features at different levels of resolution. To identify the different power quality disturbances the energy difference at each decomposition level is calculated with respect to {{the energy of the}} pure sinusoidal signal. Then probabilistic neural network is applied to classify the power quality disturbances. The simulation results validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method...|$|R

50|$|A pure {{sine wave}} {{has a single}} {{frequency}} f If the sine wave is applied to a linear circuit, such as a distortionless amplifier, the output is still a sine wave (but may acquire a phase shift).However, if the sine wave is applied to a nonlinear circuit, the resulting distortion creates harmonics; frequency components at integer multiples nf of the fundamental frequency f. The <b>distorted</b> <b>signal</b> can be described by a Fourier series in f.|$|E
50|$|A {{pre-distortion}} linearizer {{works by}} creating signal distortion (amplitude and phase) {{that is the}} complement of the signal distortion inherent in the High-Powered Amplifier. The signal to be amplified is first passed through the linearizer, distorting the signal, with no loss in gain. The <b>distorted</b> <b>signal</b> is then fed to the High-Powered Amplifier to be amplified. The distortion inherent in the High-Powered Amplifier negates the distortion introduced by the linearizer producing a near linear transfer characteristic.|$|E
5000|$|The XP series {{started in}} 1989 as a rack mounted {{programmable}} preamplifier called the XPR that {{was intended for}} direct connection to a full range PA system. There is a three band EQ that allows pre-distortion changes to the EQ. The clean signal can also be mixed with the <b>distorted</b> <b>signal.</b> The distortion {{is followed by a}} second 5 band EQ. The effects follow, including a stereo chorus that has a programmable sweep speed, along with a reverb.|$|E

5000|$|Analog signals can be {{degraded}} in {{ways that}} interfere with or confuse some recording devices. For example, Macrovision attempts to defeat recording by VCRs and DVD players by outputting a deliberately <b>distorted</b> <b>signal,</b> crippling the automatic gain control for video, causing the brightness to fluctuate wildly. While this is only supposed to happen to copies, it may, as an inadvertent side-effect, happen when viewing the original video as well. Some vendors claim to have developed equivalent techniques for preventing recording by video capture cards in personal computers. Devices exist, however, to counteract this measure.|$|E
50|$|Guitar {{distortion}} {{is obtained}} and shaped {{at various points}} in the signal processing chain, including multiple stages of preamp distortion, power valve distortion, output and power transformer distortion, and guitar speaker distortion. Much of the distortion character or voicing {{is controlled by the}} frequency response before and after each distortion stage. This dependency of distortion voicing on frequency response can be heard in the effect that a wah pedal has on the subsequent distortion stage, or by using tone controls built into the guitar, the preamp or an EQ pedal to favor the bass or treble components of the guitar pickup signal prior to the first distortion stage. Some guitarists place an equalizer pedal after the distortion effect, to emphasize or de-emphasize different frequencies in the <b>distorted</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{basis for}} the Fuzz Factory is a {{traditional}} fuzz effect circuit using New old stock Germanium Transistors, as used on the Fuzz Face, the seminal device used by Jimi Hendrix and many others during the late 1960s/early 1970s. The Fuzz Factory innovates by use of internal feedback loops and component-level bias adjustments to achieve unprecedented control, or deliberate lack thereof, of the <b>distorted</b> <b>signal.</b> Designed by electronic trial-and-error, closely tied to circuit bending, the controls of the Fuzz Factory are highly interactive, and represent {{a wide spectrum of}} tonal ability, often extending into self-oscillation and noise. Many musicians find the promise of near-infinite new sounds and textures inherent to the device to be inspiring to their music, and the Fuzz Factory has a well-known following among professional guitarists.|$|E
40|$|The HJ- 1 A/B {{satellite}} offers free {{images with}} high {{spatial and temporal}} resolution, which are effective for dynamically monitoring cyanobacteria blooms. However, the HJ- 1 A/B satellite also receives <b>distorted</b> <b>signals</b> due {{to the influence of}} atmosphere. To acquire accurate information about cyanobacteria blooms, atmospheric correction is needed. HJ- 1 A/B images were atmosphere corrected using the FLAASH atmospheric correction model. Considering the quantum effect within a certain wavelength range, a spectral response function was included in the process. Then the model was used to process HJ- 1 A/B images, and the NDVI after atmospheric correction was compared with that before correction. The standard deviation improved from 0. 13 to 0. 158. Results indicate that atmospheric correction effectively reduces the <b>distorted</b> <b>signals.</b> Finally, NDVI was utilized to monitor the cyanobacteria bloom in Donghu Lake. The accuracy was enhanced compared with that before correction...|$|R

2500|$|Many guitarists prefer using valve {{amplifiers}} to solid-state models, often {{due to the}} {{way they}} tend to distort when overdriven. (Any amplifier can only accurately amplify a signal to a certain volume; past this limit, the amplifier will begin to <b>distort</b> the <b>signal.</b> Different circuits will <b>distort</b> the <b>signal</b> in different ways; some guitarists prefer the distortion characteristics of vacuum tubes.)

50|$|In multidimensional signal processing, Multidimensional signal {{restoration}} {{refers to}} the problem of estimating the original input signal from observations of the distorted or noise contaminated version of the original signal using some prior information about the input signal and /or the distortion process. Multidimensional signal processing systems such as audio, image and video processing systems often receive as input, signals that undergo distortions like blurring, band-limiting etc. during signal acquisition or transmission and it may be vital to recover the original signal for further filtering. Multidimensional signal restoration is an inverse problem, where only the <b>distorted</b> <b>signal</b> is observed and some information about the distortion process and/or input signal properties is known. A general class of iterative methods have been developed for the multidimensional restoration problem with successful applications to multidimensional deconvolution, signal extrapolation and denoising.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, some guitarists began {{exploring}} {{a wider range}} of tonal effects by distorting the sound of the instrument. To do this, they used overdrive — increasing the gain of the preamplifier beyond the level where the signal could be reproduced with little distortion, resulting in a [...] "fuzzy" [...] sound. This effect is called [...] "clipping" [...] by sound engineers, because when viewed with an oscilloscope, the wave forms of a <b>distorted</b> <b>signal</b> appear to have had their peaks [...] "clipped off", in the process introducing additional tones (often approximating the harmonics characteristic of a square wave of that basic frequency). This was not actually a new development in the musical instrument or its supporting gear, but rather a shift of aesthetics, such sounds not having been thought desirable previously. Some distortion modes with an electric guitar increase the sustain of single notes and chords, which changes the sound of the instrument. In particular, distortion made it more feasible to perform guitar solos that used long, sustained notes.|$|E
5000|$|Biamplification {{enables a}} bassist {{to use a}} {{crossover}} circuit to split their bass signal into two: a low frequency signal and a high frequency signal, and then route the low and high frequencies into two power amplifiers, each of which send their powered signal to different speaker enclosures. One power amp (usually of higher power) handles the low frequencies, which are sent the larger drivers (at lower frequencies), and a less powerful amp amplifies the high frequencies, which are sent to the horn. For bass players seeking a pure, transparent sound, biamplification may produce a [...] "cleaner" [...] sound. For bass players in hard rock or heavy metal who are using an overdriven sound, biamplification may be safer for the horn or tweeter; while a clipped, <b>distorted</b> <b>signal</b> can be handled by a heavy-duty woofer, the same clipped signal will come much closer to damaging a horn driver or a tweeter. Biamping allows a bassist to have the [...] "dirty" [...] overdriven sound through their woofer(s) while keeping the signal sent to the horn clean, thus protecting the horn. At the high onstage volume levels used in large rock and metal concerts, a powerful, overdriven bass signal poses {{a higher risk of}} horn damage in non-biamped systems.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{alignment}} of the bar in a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) experiment plays a significant role in producing a good clean signal. In this paper, numerical simulations using ANSYS-LSDYNA are employed to comprehensively study the effects of bar misalignment in producing a <b>distorted</b> <b>signal.</b> There are six major types of bar misalignment that are commonly experienced: offset of neutral axis, uneven support height, non-parallel impact face, bar straightness, dome and cone impact face shapes. The numerical simulations are divided into two main sections, i. e. bar calibration and conventional SHPB testing. The <b>distorted</b> <b>signal</b> generated by misalignment produces unreliable data analysis and is mainly due to the presence of a flexural mode of vibration. Recommendations on selecting bar specifications to minimize the deviation of results are presented...|$|E
