40|$|Summary. A {{theoretical}} and experimental investigation {{is made of}} the heating of air {{by means of a}} 'dark ' or 'Townsend ' discharge, the intended application being the heating of the working fluid of a hypersonic <b>intermittent</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Results are presented of experiments at atmospheric pressure designed to determine the efficiency of energy conversion and to test the validity of the theoretical assumptions. The theory is used to predict the performance of a small 'pilot model ' heater working at 15 atmospheres pressure. LIST OF CONTENT...|$|E

40|$|Occurrence of {{very high}} {{starting}} and stopping transient loads in <b>intermittent</b> blowdown <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> operating at a high supersonic Mach numbers is a well known phenomenon. To avoid such loads in NAL 0. 6 m <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel,</b> a continuously Variable Mach number Flexible nozzle (VMFN) was conceived. The VMFN is designed to start the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> at a low Mach number and low stagnation pressure (P 0) and rapidly change the nozzle counter to reach the desired Mach number (upto 4. 0) along with the synchronous increase in P 0. The reverse procedure can be adopted while stopping the tunnel. The objective of the present work is to develop Software to acquire and process the transient loads that arise during the transition from low to high Mach numbers to high Mach number and vice-versa, {{as well as to}} acquire steady loads during the test Mach number in the NAL 0. 6 m blowdown <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{equipment}} and techniques {{described in detail}} in this report were developed especially {{for use in the}} <b>Intermittent</b> Supersonic <b>Wind</b> <b>Tunnel</b> for measuring pressures where the stabili-zation time is very important. The equipment consists principally of a manometer bank of 72 tubes with necessary valves, vacuum reference systems, special illumination which makes it possible to read meniscus positions with an accuracy of better than 0. 004 inches, cameras for photographic registration, control equipment which makes semi-automatic operation possible, and a negative reader for taking data off the negatives. The techniques described give procedures for determining the dimensions of tubes running from the model to the pressure measuring equipment so that stabilization times will be equal to or shorter than the allowable blowing times. The theoretical basis for the procedure is given in the reference, NOLM 10677. An actual example of determining tube dimensions is worked out to illustrate the use of the procedure. This procedure, in effect, puts tubing system design on an engineering basis. U. S. NAVAL ORDNANCE LABORATOR...|$|R

Recirculating <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> form an aerodynamic loop with turning vanes, similar to a scientific <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel,</b> but using a vertical loop with a bodyflight chamber within a vertical part of the loop. Recirculating <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> are usually built in climates that are too cold for non-recirculating <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The airflow of an indoor vertical <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> is usually smoother and more controlled than that of an outdoor unit.

Its origin dates to the year 1952, and the Second Meeting of the AGARD <b>Wind</b> <b>Tunnel</b> and Model Testing Panel in Rome, Italy, when it was decided to define two standard <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> model configurations (AGARD-A and AGARD-B) to be used for exchange of test data and comparison of test results of same models tested in different <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The idea was to establish standards of comparison between <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> and improve the validity of <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> tests. Among the standard <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> models, AGARD model configuration B (AGARD-B) has become by far the most popular.
