25|$|In Ten Inny ("The Other"), a {{collection}} of lectures delivered in Vienna, Graz and Cracow, published shortly before his death, Kapuściński laments a state of affairs perpetuated by the myths which inculcate {{the notion of the}} Other as sub-human or non-human. He saw encountering the Other as the main challenge for the twenty-first century. The posthumously published Ho dato voce ai poveri: dialogo con <b>i</b> <b>giovani</b> ("I Gave a Voice to the Poor: Conversations with the Youth"; Trent, Il Margine, 2007; subsequently published in Poland as Dałem głos ubogim. Rozmowy z młodzieżą; Cracow, Znak, 2008) is a record of Kapuściński's interactions with the students of the University of Bolzano in Italy in October 2006; while Rwący nurt historii. Zapiski o XX i XXI wieku ("In the Whirlpools of History: Jottings on the 20th and the 21st Centuries"; Cracow, Znak, 2007) is a compilation of interviews and lectures, reflecting Kapuściński's training as a historian and dealing with contemporary issues and their historical and cross-cultural parallels (including such issues as globalisation, Islam, the birth of the Third World, and the dawn of the Pacific civilisation).|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} aims {{to account}} for the Marked Balinese Students’ Personal Names. Four research problems are studied, namely (1) the criteria used to distinguish the marked names (NDMBmk) and the unmarked ones (NDMTBmk), (2) the functions of the markedness, (3) the factors that influence it, and (4) the ideologies that operate behind it. The markedness of personal names reflect a relation between the arbitrariness in language uses and the extralinguistic factors influencing it. In the context of Balinese, the tradition, legal practices, and the globalisation may affect the arbitrariness. In order to determine NDMBmk, criteria of markedness was constructed. According to the criteria, structurally, NDMBmk consist of at least five elements, as Anak Agung Arim Kasunu Arya Penarungan. Behaviorally, they may consist of names not derived from Balinese and/or Sanskrit, such as <b>Giovani</b> on <b>I</b> Gede Adeyaka <b>Giovani,</b> adopt a foreign spelling system as Chrisna on Ni Putu Chrisna Wulandari, or use no markers of Balinese ethnics or caste as Yunisari Wira Putri. Out of 698 sampled names, NDMBmk are found 54. Besides denoting, the marked elements also function to distinguish personal identities, to shape the existence of the name holder, to connote particular perception, and to reflect the changing era. The factors influencing the markedness are the need to express something new, a wish to acculturate, to raise status or keep a distance socially, and to demonstrate a linguistic expertise, or when seeing from the concept of imagery, the factors are the imagery on something new and on social status or distancing. The ideologies behind the phenomenon are globalist, nationalist, and the casteless-Balinese. </p...|$|R
2500|$|A {{series of}} {{black-and-white}} films based on Don Camillo character {{created by the}} Italian writer and journalist Giovannino Guareschi were made between 1952 and 1965. These were French-Italian coproductions, and starred Fernandel as Don Camillo and Gino Cervi as Peppone. The titles are: The Little World of Don Camillo, The Return of Don Camillo, Don Camillo's Last Round, , and Don Camillo in Moscow. Mario Camerini began filming the film Don Camillo e <b>i</b> <b>giovani</b> d'oggi but had to stop filming due to Fernandel's falling ill, which resulted in his untimely death. [...] The film was then completed in 1972 with Gastone Moschin {{playing the role of}} Don Camillo and Lionel Stander as Peppone. A Don Camillo (The World of Don Camillo) film was remade in 1983, an Italian production with Terence Hill directing and also starring as Don Camillo. Colin Blakely performed Peppone in one of his last film roles.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{a seven-year}} period, Calvino wrote three realist novels, The White Schooner (1947–1949), Youth in Turin (1950–1951), and The Queen's Necklace (1952–54), but all were deemed defective. During the {{eighteen}} months {{it took to}} complete <b>I</b> <b>giovani</b> del Po (Youth in Turin), he made an important self-discovery: [...] "I began doing what came most naturally to me – that is, following {{the memory of the}} things I had loved best since boyhood. Instead of making myself write the book I ought to write, the novel that was expected of me, I conjured up the book I myself would have liked to read, the sort by an unknown writer, from another age and another country, discovered in an attic." [...] The result was Il visconte dimezzato (1952; The Cloven Viscount) composed in 30 days between July and September 1951. The protagonist, a seventeenth century viscount sundered in two by a cannonball, incarnated Calvino's growing political doubts and the divisive turbulence of the Cold War. Skillfully interweaving elements of the fable and the fantasy genres, the allegorical novel launched him as a modern [...] "fabulist". In 1954, Giulio Einaudi commissioned his Fiabe Italiane (1956; Italian Folktales) {{on the basis of the}} question, [...] "Is there an Italian equivalent of the Brothers Grimm?" [...] For two years, Calvino collated tales found in 19th century collections across Italy then translated 200 of the finest from various dialects into Italian. [...] Key works he read at this time were Vladimir Propp's Morphology of the Folktale and Historical Roots of Russian Fairy Tales, stimulating his own ideas on the origin, shape and function of the story.|$|E

50|$|Eugenio Da Venezia {{was born}} in Venice. He trained at the Art Institute and the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice. His {{teachers}} were Ettore Tito, Emilio Paggiaro and Vittorio Bressanin.

Here {{he was part of}} the group later known as <b>I</b> <b>Giovani</b> di Palazzo Carminati (The Palazzo Carminati Young) with Marco Novati, Fioravante Seibezzi, Juti Ravenna, Neno Mori, Mario Varagnolo and others. This group was influenced by Pio Semeghini and by the Scuola di Burano (Burano School). They were an anti-academic movement characterized by clear tones, and direct contact with nature. Eugenio Da Venezia and his painters friends rejected the avant-garde art for a real rappresentation of the nature, portraits, still life using the colour as main element, according to the history of Art Venice tradition.|$|E

This novel retraces the history of the failure and repression of the Fasci Siciliani in the period from 1893 to 1894. When the novel came out in 1913 Pirandello sent a copy of it to his parents for their fiftieth wedding anniversary along with a dedication which said that [...] "their names, Stefano and Caterina, live heroically." [...] However, while the mother is transfigured in the novel into the otherworldly figure of Caterina Laurentano, the father, represented by the husband of Caterina, Stefano Auriti, appears only in memories and flashbacks, since, as was acutely observed by Leonardo Sciascia, [...] "he died censured in a Freudian sense by his son who, in the bottom of his soul, is his enemy." [...] Also in 1909, Pirandello began his collaboration with the prestigious journal Corriere della Sera in which he published the novellas Mondo di Carta (World of Paper), La Giara, and, in 1910, Non è una cosa seria and Pensaci, Giacomino! (Think it over, Giacomino!) At this point Pirandello's fame as a writer was continually increasing. His private life, however, was poisoned by the suspicion and obsessive jealousy of Antonietta who began turning physically violent.|$|E
