Thanks to new results on the asymptotic normality of the multivariate k-nearest neighbor regression estimate, we propose an interesting and new approach to solve in particular the forecasting of economic indicators, included GDP modelling.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we review - from a UK {{perspective}} - how the UK {{government and its}} policy process have adapted to European integration. Has adaptation been a quiet revolution, a step-change, or both? In exploring this puzzle we draw upon the conceptual literature of Europeanisation. We employ it {{to shed light on}} the longer-term pattern of UK adaptation as well as to put into context the domestic changes currently under way. Although commentators frequently alight upon continued non-membership of the <b>euro</b> as an <b>indicator</b> of the UK's continued incomplete adaptation to integration, we argue that there is a step-change under way in the Europeanisation of UK EU policy making, though not necessarily in its outcomes...|$|R

Additionally, we find that indicators perform better in boom periods than inrecessions. The OECD and FAZ indicators are both composite indicators and deliver themost accurate forecasts.

This paper deals with both, expectations {{and uncertainty}} derived from the European Central Bank Survey of Professional Forecasters. Given the strong turbulences that the <b>euro</b> area macroeconomic <b>indicators</b> observe since 2007, the aim of the paper is to check whether there is any room for improvement of the consensus forecast accuracy for GDP growth and inflation when accounting for uncertainty. We propose a new measure of uncertainty, alternative to the ad hoc equal weights commonly used, based on principal components. We test the role of uncertainty in forecasting macroeconomic performance in the euro area between 2005 and 2015.

Monetary Conditions in the <b>Euro</b> Area: Useful <b>Indicators</b> of Aggregate Demand Conditions? * This paper reviews the usefulness of monetary conditions in the euro area as leading indicators for aggregate demand conditions. Monetary conditions are measured with the MCI concept proposed by the Bank of Canada, and with the yield spread. A central result is that causality runs in both ways between monetary and aggregate demand conditions. The endogeneity of monetary conditions raises important implications for its role as a predictor of aggregate demand. It is shown that the information content of monetary conditions depends on the source of business cycle fluctuations and on the response of the central bank to those fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEmerging {{economies and}} {{especially}} the BRICS countries have strong economic ties with the euro area. In addition, the financial crisis in the euro area may have effects on other markets or areas, especially those of the main emerging markets. Credit default swap (CDS) spreads are relevant indicators of credit risks. After identifying a set of fundamental determinants for sovereign CDS spreads, including euro area financial factors and computing Markov switching unit root test, we estimate Markov switching models over the period from January 2002 to August 2012, {{in order to examine}} the behaviour of sovereign CDS spreads in the BRICS countries., i) We detect two different regimes for the BRICS, that finding is backed by conventional robustness checks and economic events; ii) most of the explanatory variables are involved in the determining theses regimes. Thus both financial and real factors {{have an impact on the}} relations defining each regime, except for Russia which is only impacted by financial ones. Especially, <b>euro</b> area financial <b>indicators</b> are largely involved in the BRICS sovereign CDS spreads’ dynamics. Besides, the robustness check supports the use of euro area variables as determinants of BRICS sovereign CDS spreads...|$|R
40|$|Combining {{economic}} {{time series}} with the aim to obtain an indicator for business cycle analyses {{is an important issue}} for policy makers. In this area, econometric techniques usually rely on systems with either a small number of series, N, (VAR or VECM) or, at the other extreme, a very large N (factor models). In this paper we propose tools to select the relevant business cycle indicators in a "medium" N framework, a situation that {{is likely to be the}} most frequent in empirical works. An example is provided by our empirical application, in which we study jointly the short-run co-movements of 24 European countries. We show, under not too restrictive conditions, that parsimonious single-equation models can be used to split a set of N countries in three groups. The first group comprises countries that share a synchronous common cycle, a non-synchronous common cycle is present among the countries of the second group, and the third group collects countries that exhibit idiosyncratic cycles. Moreover, we offer a method for constructing a composite coincident indicator that explicitly takes into account the existence of these various forms of short-run co-movements among variables.

40|$|This paper {{should not}} be {{reported}} as representing {{the views of the}} IMF, the ECB or the Eurosystem. The US business cycle has been found to lead the European cycle by a few quarters, a piece of information which previous research has fruitfully used to forecast euro area GDP. In this paper, we investigate whether selected financial variables, either from the US or the euro area, carry further information. We use vector autoregressions (VARs) which include the US and the euro area GDPs as a minimal set of variables as well as growth in the Rest of the World (an aggregation of seven small countries) and selected combinations of financial variables. Impulse responses (in-sample) show that shocks to financial variables influence real activity. Out-of-sample RMFE metric evidence that for the United States financial variables produce a lower error, especially at the fifth quarter ahead but declining thereafter. Yet, this macro-financial linkage remains weak in the <b>euro</b> area: financial <b>indicators</b> do not improve short and medium term forecasts of real activity in the euro area, even when their timely availability, relative to GDP, is exploited. As the euro area GDP lags behind the US GDP, and US GDP is at some horizons predictable via financial variables, it is the...|$|R
40|$|Economic policy makers, {{international}} organisations and private-sector forecasters commonly use short-term forecasts of real GDP growth based on monthly indicators, such as industrial production, retail sales and confidence surveys. An {{assessment of the}} reliability of such tools and {{of the source of}} potential forecast errors is essential. While many studies have evaluated the size of forecast errors related to model specifications and unavailability of data in real time, few have provided a complete assessment of forecast errors, which should notably take into account the impact of data revision. This paper proposes to bridge this gap. Using four years of data vintages for <b>euro</b> area conjunctural <b>indicators,</b> the paper decomposes forecast errors into four elements (model specification, erroneous extrapolations of the monthly indicators, revisions to the monthly indicators and revisions to the GDP data series) and assesses their relative sizes. The results show that gains in accuracy of forecasts achieved by using monthly data on actual activity rather than surveys or financial indicators are offset {{by the fact that the}} former set of monthly data is harder to forecast and less timely than the latter set. While the results presented in the paper remain tentative due to limited data availability, they provide a benchmark which future research may build on.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new model-based method {{to obtain a}} {{coincident}} indicator for the business cycle. A dynamic factor model with trend components and a common cycle component is considered which can be estimated using standard maximum likelihood methods. The multivariate unobserved components model includes a stationary higher order cycle. Also higher order trends {{can be part of}} the analysis. These generalisations lead to a business cycle that is similar to a band-pass one. Furthermore, cycle shifts for individual time series are incorporated within the model and estimated simultaneously with the remaining parameters. This feature permits the use of leading, coincident and lagging variables to obtain the business cycle coincident indicator without prior analysis of their lead-lag relationship. Besides the business cycle indicator, the model-based approach also allows to get a growth rate indicator. In the empirical analysis for the <b>Euro</b> area, both <b>indicators</b> are obtained based on nine key economic time series including gross domestic product, industrial production, unemployment, confidence indicators and interest rate spread. This analysis contrasts sharply with earlier multivariate approaches. In particular, our more parsimonious approach leads to a growth rate <b>indicator</b> for the <b>Euro</b> area that is similar to the one of EuroCOIN. The latter is based on a more involved approach by any standard and uses hundreds of time series from individual countries belonging to the Euro area. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{provides an}} overview of the most common short-term indicators of economic development in the <b>euro</b> area. These <b>indicators</b> are useful when official data are released with long time lags or if they are subject to major revisions. Indicators based on surveys among businesses, households, financial market analysts or forecasters have the advantage of providing detailed and timely information on individual sectors on a monthly basis and largely without later revision. As an additional instrument, composite indicators, which are calculated by combining a variety of measures into a single indicator with the help of regression and factor analysis, offer an attractive tool for drawing conclusions from different, often divergent signals. Even the most reliable economic indicators, however, can only be interpreted as constituent elements of comprehensive economic analysis. With regard to the new EU Member States, coverage is found to be limited as yet. This study also shows that the forecasting quality of the European Commission 's business and consumer surveys for the new Member States is not as high as for the other EU Member States. As the reliability of economic indicators increases as forecasting institutions and respondents gain more experience, coverage of established indicators should be extended early on to this group of countries, in particular as some of the new Member States may soon join the euro area.
