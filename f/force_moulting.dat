40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of various <b>force</b> <b>moulting</b> methods on egg physical and mechanical characteristics, plasma metabolites and performance of Japanese quails from 26 to 36 weeks of age. The treatments were: T 1 (control), T 2 (feed restriction), T 3 (alfalfa powder), T 4 (wheat screening powder, a by-product obtained after harvesting and processing of wheat). Egg production ceased completely with feed restriction and alfalfa treatments by days 4 and 3. Also, birds under feed restriction and alfalfa treatments returned to first egg at day 4 of post-moulting period. No {{significant differences were found}} in feed intake, egg mass, egg production, feed conversion ratio (FCR), and mortality of quails in response to experimental treatments after moulting (P> 0. 05). Feed restriction led to significantly higher egg weight in comparison to control and wheat screening treatments (P 0. 05). The calcium concentration was higher (P< 0. 001) in control birds than in others at the end of moulting. It can be concluded that using alfalfa {{and to a lesser extent}} feed restriction may be suitable force-moulting methods in quails...|$|E
40|$|Dietary calcium restriotion is {{studied as}} a method of {{controlling}} egg production. Attempts have been made to delay the onset of egg production in the fowl by feeding pre-laying diets deficient in calcium. Calcium restriction had no apparent effect on sexual development and did not delay the time· of first oviposition. Low calcium diets were used at a later date to halt egg production firstly just after peak production and secondly {{towards the end of the}} first laying year. Egg production was depressed markedly but never completely ceased, and remained at a low level until calcium restrictions were lifted whereupon a rapid rise returned egg production to levels comparable to egg production rates of non calcium restricted control hens. Comparisons between egg production, egg weight, shell weight and a measure of shell quality (shell weight per unit surface area of egg) revealed trends towards improved shell production and shell quality following calcium restriction but little else. There was only a small number of significant differences. Egg production pauses induced by low dietary calcium were thought to be unsatisfactory as substitutes for <b>force</b> <b>moulting.</b> Calcium restriction caused declines in food consumption and body weight. While food consumption returned to levels equivalent to food consumption of non calcium restricted hens after calcium restriction, body weight in general did not. Calculations of the calcium loss from the body of calcium restricted hens via egg·shell production show that extremely severe depletion occurs unless egg prvduction is stopped or at least egg shell production is stopped. Such depletion of calcium has greatest effects on the skeleton and damage to the bones, particularly of the legs, may result. This is a condition which may predispose to a paralytic condition characteristic of extreme calcium deficiency...|$|E
50|$|Flocks are {{sometimes}} <b>force</b> <b>moulted,</b> {{rather than being}} slaughtered, to reinvigorate egg-laying. This involves complete withdrawal of food (and sometimes water) for 7 to 14 days or sufficiently long to cause a body weight loss of 25 to 35%. This stimulates the hen to lose her feathers, but also reinvigorates egg-production. Some flocks may be <b>force</b> <b>moulted</b> several times. In 2003, more than 75% of all flocks were moulted in the US. This temporary starving of the hens is seen as inhumane and is the main point of objection by critics and opponents of the practice. The alternative most often employed is to slaughter the hens instead of moulting them.|$|R
25|$|Commercial hens usually begin laying eggs at 16–20 {{weeks of}} age, {{although}} production gradually declines soon after from approximately 25 weeks of age. This {{means that in}} many countries, by approximately 72 weeks of age, flocks are considered economically unviable and are slaughtered after approximately 12 months of egg production, although chickens will naturally live for 6 or more years. In some countries, hens are <b>force</b> <b>moulted</b> to re-invigorate egg-laying.|$|R
5000|$|Chickens farmed for {{eggs are}} called {{egg-laying}} hens. In total, the UK alone consumes more than 34 million eggs per day. Some hens breeds can produce over 300 eggs per year, with [...] "the highest authenticated rate of egg laying being 371 eggs in 364 days". [...] After 12 months of laying, the commercial hen's egg-laying ability starts to decline {{to the point}} where the flock is unviable. Hens, particularly from battery cage systems, are sometimes infirm or have lost a significant amount of their feathers, and their life expectancy has been reduced from around seven years to less than two years. [...] In the UK and Europe, laying hens are then slaughtered and used in processed foods or sold as [...] "soup hens". [...] In some other countries, flocks are sometimes <b>force</b> <b>moulted,</b> rather than being slaughtered, to reinvigorate egg-laying. This involves complete withdrawal of food (and sometimes water) for 7-14 days or sufficiently long to cause a body weight loss of 25 to 35%, or up to 28 days under experimental conditions. This stimulates the hen to lose her feathers, but also reinvigorates egg-production. Some flocks may be <b>force</b> <b>moulted</b> several times.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the results of table egg production Lohmann Brown hybrid chickens before and after <b>forced</b> <b>moulting,</b> or study of the impact of forced molting on productivity and the duration of its lifetime hens. The surveys cover three periods, namely: - the first production of eggs in the first year (from 19 - 71. Weeks of age hens); the second - moulting period (from 72 - 76. Sunday); the third - after the forced molting period (from 77 - 106. weeks of age hens). The experiment was conducted on a total of 44, 400 commercial laying hens reared in a cage system, 'enriched' cages, family farm 'Rakic-Commerce' (Batkovic, Bijeljina, Republic of Serbian, BiH). From 19 to 48 weeks of age with a hen housed load intensity was 85, 11 %, from 19 to 71 weeks of age to 82. 49 %, while the second phase capacity uu after moulting after laying hen housed intensity of the load was 74. 36 %. From 19 to 48 weeks of age mortality rate was 4. 21 %, up 8. 47 % 71 weeks, during moulting 1. 35 %, from 77 to 106 weeks of age 3. 24 %. Between the age of hens and intensity of capacity in the first 30 weeks egg production was determined by the mean positive correlation connection (rp = 0. 470) (P < 0. 01). In other phases of the production cycle of these indicators did not exist or were very weak negative correlation...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{effects of}} {{varying levels of}} crude protein and {{follicle}} stimulation were studied on the recovery and performance of one hundred post moulted, aged, Nera Black Hens. Moulting was induced at production capacity of 33. 6 %. The birds were thereafter randomly assigned to four (4) groups (each of two replicates). Two groups received 16 % crude protein (CP) level diets {{and the other two}} groups, 32 %. One each of the two groups received follicle stimulation, induced by administration of Clomifene citrate (1. 5 mg/kg) via cathetered 5 ml syringe through the 10 week experimental period, with feed and water offered ad libitum. Egg production ceased on day 5 of <b>forced</b> <b>moulting.</b> Post-moult menarche and return to pre-moult status had occurred on days 4 and 8 respectively in all the groups. Post-moult hen-day peak production performance was 87. 5 %, 91. 7 %, 68. 0 % and 83. 3 % for birds assigned to 16 % CP diet without follicle stimulation (Group 1 – control), 16 % CP diet plus follicle stimulation (Group 2), 32 % CP diet without follicle stimulation (Group 3) and 32 % CP plus follicle stimulation (Group 4). Post-moult mean weekly production performance was 69. 66 %; 67. 26 %; 56. 40 % and 63. 69 % for groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 hens respectively. Follicle stimulation enhanced post-moult production performance especially the hen-day performance in birds on 16 % CP diet. Higher protein diet did not per se enhance peak production, post-moult menarche and return to pre-moult status...|$|R
40|$|In laying hens, {{the primary}} sources of {{progesterone}} (P 4) are the granulosa {{cells of the}} 4 - 5 largest follicles {{in the hierarchy of}} the ovary. During <b>forced</b> <b>moulting,</b> cessation of egg production occurs with ovarian atrophy and a decrease in P 4 as well as in luteinizing hormone. While it is reported that follicular atresia as well as the P 4 decrease are the result of a reduced luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulation, P 4 decrease occurred already during the second or third day after food withdrawal while atresia occurred only several days later. Since P 4 decrease at the beginning of moult induction cannot simply be explained by the lack of large follicles the aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether the rapid decrease in P 4 after food withdrawal is only related to a decreased hypophyseal stimulus and/or a concomitant change in follicular sensitivity as well. Granulosa cells from follicles F 1 to F 4 were collected according to the method of Gilbert et al. (1977). Cell number was estimated with a haemocytometer and viability by trypan blue exclusion technique. Cell suspension was diluted to 10 (5) cells ml- 1 in M 199 and incubated for 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h with or without oLH, and P 4 secretion in the medium was assayed by RIA. Short-term starvation increased P 4 response in vitro to oLH indicating a higher sensitivity of granulosa cells of follicles from all classes to oLH. In an additional experiment, in vivo injections of different doses of LH also showed an enhanced increase in P 4 the first days of food restriction. Therefore, the rapid decrease in P 4 after feed withdrawal is not due to a decreased follicular sensitivity but to a decrease in stimulatory factor(s). status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus and Great Tits Parus major from low quality habitat (small woods) would have less yellow ventral plumage {{than those from}} high quality habitat (large woods) because they moult faster and/or their diet contains fewer carotenoids. They moult faster because they moult {{later in the season}} and are subject to more rapidly shortening daylengths. We tested this using a database of the plumage coloration (chroma, hue and lightness) of birds breeding in woods of different sizes, by manipulating the speed of moult in captive Blue Tits, and by counting the abundance and size of caterpillars (the major source of dietary carotenoids) in the diet of nestlings. In accordance with our hypothesis, juveniles of both species (which moult about three weeks later than adults) were about 8 % less saturated in colour (lower chroma) than adults, but {{there was no significant difference}} in chroma between habitats. However, both species did differ significantly in hue between large and small woods. Blue Tits <b>forced</b> to <b>moult</b> faster in captivity, at a rate similar to that caused by a month's delay in the start of moult, had yellow flank feathers that were 32 % less saturated in colour than those allowed to moult more slowly. Blue Tit nestlings in large woods consumed 47 % more caterpillar flesh (per gram of faecal material voided) than those in small woods, and Great Tit pulli 81 % more. When habitat effects were controlled for in ANOVAs, Blue Tits mated assortatively on the basis of flank hue and Great Tits on the basis of flank lightness. Flank colour therefore has the capacity to provide information about the potential quality of both habitats, and individual birds, to potential colonists and sexual partners...|$|R
