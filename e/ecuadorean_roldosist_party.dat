5000|$|The Ecuadorian <b>Roldosist</b> <b>Party</b> [...] (Partido Roldosista Ecuatoriano) was {{a populist}} {{political}} party in Ecuador. The party {{was named after}} former President Jaime Roldós. It was founded after Roldós' death by his brother-in-law Abdalá Bucaram as a more leftish spin-off from the Concentration of People's Forces. Bucaram was elected President in 1996 but was impeached the following year. Though Jaime Roldós's brother León Roldós is still very involved in Ecuadorian politics, {{he is not a}} member of the <b>Roldosist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, his son, Abdalá [...] "Dalo" [...] Bucarám Jr. is {{currently}} {{part of the}} Ecuadorian Congress, following his father's steps, representing the Ecuadorian <b>Roldosist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|R
50|$|He was the Mayor of Guayaquil, and {{the founder}} {{and member of the}} Ecuadorian <b>Roldosist</b> <b>Party</b> (PRE). He then competed for the {{presidency}} of the Republic in 1988 and 1992 before succeeding in the 1996 run.|$|R
25|$|Noboa is {{the leader}} of the Institutional Renewal Party of National Action (Partido Renovador Institucional de Acción Nacional, PRIAN), a populist party he founded himself after {{separating}} from the populist center-right Ecuadorian <b>Roldosist</b> <b>Party</b> (Partido Roldosista Ecuatoriano, PRE).|$|R
50|$|The {{party was}} {{established}} on 20 October 2014 by Abdalá Bucaram, Jr. {{as a successor}} to the Ecuadorian <b>Roldosist</b> <b>Party,</b> which had its legal registration withdrawn. It was registered in 2015 by the National Electoral Council after presenting 226,040 signatures.|$|R
5000|$|After Roldós's death, the National Congress named Roldós's brother, León Roldós, as Vice President of Ecuador for the {{remainder}} of what would have been Jaime Roldós's term. León Roldós was later a candidate for president in 1992, 2002, and 2006. Jaime Roldós's daughter, Martha Roldós Bucaram, was a presidential candidate in the 2009 elections. Jaime Roldós's son, Santiago Roldós Bucaram, is a journalist and playwright. Jaime Roldós's brother-in-law, Abdalá Bucaram, founded the populist Ecuadorian <b>Roldosist</b> <b>Party</b> and was elected president of Ecuador. He governed from August 1996 to February 1997, when he was removed by the National Congress on the grounds of [...] "mental incapacity". Martha Roldós has said that the Ecuadorian <b>Roldosist</b> <b>Party</b> has corrupted her father's ideals.|$|R
50|$|General {{elections}} {{were held in}} Ecuador on 19 May 1996, with {{a second round of}} the presidential elections on 7 July. Although Jaime Nebot of the Social Christian Party received the most votes in the first round, Abdalá Bucaram of the Ecuadorian <b>Roldosist</b> <b>Party</b> won the run-off with 54.5% of the vote. The Social Christian Party remained the largest in the Chamber of Deputies, winning 27 of the 82 seats.|$|R
5000|$|Eight presidential {{candidates}} were {{registered in the}} National Electoral Council. [...] The candidates were: Rafael Correa of the PAIS Alliance movement, Guillermo Lasso of the Creating Opportunities movement, Lucio Gutiérrez of the PSP party, Alberto Acosta Espinoza, candidate of the Coordinating Committee of the Left, Norman Wray, of the Ruptura 25 movement, Nelson Zavala, of the <b>Roldosist</b> <b>Party,</b> Mauricio Rodas, of the SUMA movement, and Álvaro Noboa, of PRIAN.|$|R
50|$|At the {{legislative}} elections, 20 October 2002, the party won 15 out of 100 seats. Its candidate Jacobo Bucaram Ortiz won 11.9% {{of the vote}} in the presidential elections of the same day, coming in 6th place. At {{the legislative}} elections of October 15, 2006, the party was badly defeated, winning 6 of 100 seats in the Congress. Its presidential candidate in 1998, Álvaro Noboa, who was narrowly defeated in that election, ran as a presidential candidate in 2002, 2006 and 2009 for another party and participated unsuccessfully in a runoff both times. The <b>Roldosist</b> <b>Party's</b> own presidential candidate for the 2006 election, Fernando Rosero received less than 2% of the vote.|$|R
5000|$|The leading contestants {{of the six}} (including two women) {{vying for}} the {{presidency}} were Jamil Mahuad (DP-UDC), the mayor of Quito, and Álvaro Noboa (Ecuadorian <b>Roldosist</b> <b>Party),</b> a wealthy businessman. Campaign debates were marked by personal accusations of drug links and threatened lawsuits between the two rivals, alongside statements on substantive policy questions relating primarily to corruption and the country’s ailing economy. Problems in this latter sector (high inflation, budget deficit) had been aggravated by the sociological and infrastructural damage caused by the climatic phenomenon known as El Niño and the worldwide drop in oil prices, Ecuador’s main export earner. Mahuad advocated an intense program of private investment to achieve a 5% annual growth rate, privatizations, job creation and housing construction.|$|R
5000|$|Roldos was {{immediately}} succeeded by Vice President Osvaldo Hurtado, who was followed in 1984 by León Febres Cordero from the Social Christian Party. Rodrigo Borja Cevallos of the Democratic Left (Izquierda Democrática, or ID) party {{won the presidency}} in 1988, running in the runoff election against Abdalá Bucaram (brother in law of Jaime Roldos {{and founder of the}} Ecuadorian <b>Roldosist</b> <b>Party).</b> His government was committed to improving human rights protection and carried out some reforms, notably an opening of Ecuador to foreign trade. The Borja government concluded an accord leading to the disbanding of the small terrorist group, [...] "¡Alfaro Vive, Carajo!" [...] ("Alfaro Lives, Dammit!"), named after Eloy Alfaro. However, continuing economic problems undermined the popularity of the ID, and opposition parties gained control of Congress in 1999.|$|R
50|$|In December 2004, Gutiérrez {{alleged that}} the Supreme Court of Justice was biased {{in favor of the}} PSC. His {{political}} party, PSP, together with the Institutional Renewal Party of National Action (Partido Renovador Institucional de Acción Nacional/PRIAN) of Álvaro Noboa, the Ecuadorian <b>Roldosist</b> <b>Party</b> (Partido Roldosista Ecuatoriano/PRE) of Abdalá Bucaram, independents, and MPD, voted in the Congress for the reorganization of the Supreme Court of Justice via majority resolution. His adversaries sustained that the Constitution gives autonomy to the judicial branch and does not authorize Congress to interfere in the judiciary by removing or nominating judges. Judges were replaced by allies to PRE, PRIAN and PSP political parties with the clear intention of dropping criminal charges against former president Abdalá Bucaram, accused of several acts of corruption during his presidency which led to his exile in Panama from 1997 until April 2005.|$|R
