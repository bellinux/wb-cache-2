40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique ca <b>ed</b> Improved Squeaky <b>Wheel</b> Optimisation (ISWO) for driver schedu in g prob ems. I t improves the origin a Squeaky Whee Optimisation 's (SWO) effectiven ess an d execution speed by in corporatin g two addition a steps of Selection an d Mu tation which implemen evolution within a sin le solution. In the ISWO, {{a cycle of}} Analysis-Selection- Mutation-Prioritization-Construction continues un til stoppin con dition s are reached. The Analysis step first computes the fitn ess of a curren t solut ion to iden tify troublesome compon en ts. The Selection step then discards these troublesome compon en ts probabilistically by usin the f itn ess measure, an d the - tation step follows to further discard a small n umber of compon en ts at ran dom. After the above steps, an in put solution becomes pa rtial an d thus the resultin partial solution n eeds to be repaired. The repair is carried out by usin the Prioritization step to first produce priorities that determin e an order by which the following Construction step then schedules the remaining components. Therefore, the optimisation in the ISWO is achieved by solution disruption, iterative improvement and an iterative constructive repair process performed. Encouraging experimental results are reported...|$|R
