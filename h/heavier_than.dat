5|$|Almost all {{elements}} <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> {{hydrogen and helium}} were created inside the cores of stars.|$|E
5|$|Supernovae are {{the major}} source of {{elements}} <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> nitrogen. These elements are produced by nuclear fusion for nuclei up to 34S, by silicon photodisintegration rearrangement and quasiequilibrium (see Supernova nucleosynthesis) during silicon burning for nuclei between 36Ar and 56Ni, and by rapid captures of neutrons during the supernova's collapse for elements <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> iron. Nucleosynthesis during silicon burning yields nuclei roughly 1000-100,000 times more abundant than the r-process isotopes <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> iron. Supernovae are the most likely, although not undisputed, candidate sites for the r-process, which is the rapid capture of neutrons that occurs at high temperature and high density of neutrons. Those reactions produce highly unstable nuclei that are rich in neutrons and that rapidly beta decay into more stable forms. The r-process produces about half of all the heavier isotopes of the elements beyond iron, including plutonium and uranium. The only other major competing process for producing elements <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> iron is the s-process in large, old, red-giant AGB stars, which produces these elements slowly over longer epochs and which cannot produce elements <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> lead.|$|E
5|$|Hence {{the atomic}} nuclei, which are much <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> an electron, {{contribute}} negligibly to the scattered X-rays.|$|E

50|$|This {{species is}} easily {{distinguished}} from the yellow-fronted canary by its lack of black facial markings, and its bill is less <b>heavy</b> <b>than</b> that of other similar African Crithagra species.|$|R
5|$|The {{isotopes}} of ytterbium {{range in}} atomic weight from 147.9674 {{atomic mass unit}} (u) for 148Yb to 180.9562u for 181Yb. The primary decay mode of ytterbium isotopes lighter than the most abundant stable isotope, 174Yb, is electron capture, and the primary decay mode for those <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> 174Yb is beta decay. The primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes lighter than 174Yb are thulium isotopes, and the primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes with <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> 174Yb are lutetium isotopes.|$|E
5|$|Elements <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> iron were {{produced}} in supernovae through the r-process and in AGB stars through the s-process, {{both of which}} involve the capture of neutrons by atomic nuclei. Elements such as lead formed largely through the radioactive decay of heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|The fire on Yorktown {{from the}} allies was <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> ever as new {{artillery}} pieces joined the line. Cornwallis talked with his officers {{that day and}} they agreed that their situation was hopeless.|$|E
50|$|In 2014 Made Of Hate {{ended their}} {{relationship}} with AFM Records and signed with Fonografika. In April 2014 band released their 3rd album entitled Out Of Hate. <b>Heaviest</b> <b>than</b> ever, new album received great feedback again.|$|R
5000|$|... "Calling" [...] is {{the first}} single {{released}} from Taproot's third studio album Blue-Sky Research. Like most of the songs on the album, it is significantly less <b>heavy</b> <b>than</b> their previous singles, and shows more of a standard alternative rock/post-grunge approach.|$|R
50|$|The {{game was}} more combat <b>heavy</b> <b>than</b> the {{previous}} releases {{in the series}} and there was less time spent in exploration mode. While {{the tone of the}} release was epic in scale, ultimately leading to an encounter with the dark goddess Takhisis, the game was marred by significant bugs.|$|R
5|$|The smooth coat type of {{the breed}} closely resembles the Pražský Krysařík breed of the Czech Republic. The Pražský on average {{is a little}} shorter on leg and a little <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> the Russian Toy.|$|E
5|$|While in Indonesia, McLeod {{was plagued}} by body image issues and {{developed}} an eating disorder. She was <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> many girls at her high school, and would often skip meals and exercise more instead. Her family eventually hired a nutritionist to help.|$|E
5|$|During the Late Pleistocene, {{the more}} southerly {{occurring}} dire wolf (Canis dirus) {{had the same}} shape and proportions as the Yukon wolf, but the dire wolf subspecies C.dirusguildayi is estimated to have weighed on average , and the subspecies C.dirusdirus on average , with some specimens being larger. The dire wolf was <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> the Beringian wolf and possessed a more robust skull and dentition.|$|E
50|$|Version 6 (2011): This is more bulky and <b>heavy</b> <b>than</b> {{the last}} 5 versions, mainly {{due to the}} fact it can move its arms. It wasn't {{received}} very well by buyers due to it not being very interactive. It also cannot cry real tears unlike the last 4 versions.|$|R
50|$|There are, however, {{varieties}} {{of the traditional}} rye bread with wheat and whole grain added to make it less dense, but also called rúgbrauð. These varieties {{tend to be less}} <b>heavy</b> <b>than</b> the traditional straight rye variety and more similar to the modern Danish rugbrød or German pumpernickel.|$|R
2500|$|Guitarist Jeff Schroeder also {{hinted that}} the album {{may be less}} <b>heavy</b> <b>than</b> past albums, stating [...] "In this day and age, with what's going on {{politically}} and socially, it just feels right to play something that's a little more spacey and dreamy. We want music to move people on an emotional level." ...|$|R
5|$|During the September 2007 tour, Chamberlain stated {{various times}} that the band will release a new album in mid-2008. It was later {{confirmed}} {{that it would be}} released on September 2, 2008. Recording for the album began in March 2008 and ended in April 2008. McTague said that the album, Lost in the Sound of Separation, would be considerably <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> Define the Great Line.|$|E
5|$|During their helium-burning phase, {{a star of}} {{more than}} 9 solar masses expands to form first a blue and then a red supergiant. Particularly massive stars may evolve to a Wolf-Rayet star, characterised by spectra {{dominated}} by emission lines of elements <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> hydrogen, which have reached the surface due to strong convection and intense mass loss.|$|E
5|$|From {{the pound}} {{down to the}} scruple, the English apothecaries' system was {{a subset of the}} Roman weight system except that the troy pound and its subdivisions were {{slightly}} <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> the Roman pound and its subdivisions. Similar systems were used all over Europe, but with considerable local variation described below under Variants.|$|E

50|$|The dialect {{itself is}} more {{distinctive}} than many people realise. It is quite noticeably {{different from the}} accent spoken in adjacent towns such as Wigan. The Mancunian accent is less dialect <b>heavy</b> <b>than</b> neighbouring Lancashire and Cheshire accents, although words such as owt (meaning 'anything') and nowt (meaning 'nothing') remain part of the Mancunian vocabulary.|$|R
50|$|Heimdall {{possesses}} {{the powers of}} a typical Asgardian, including superhuman strength, stamina, speed, agility and durability. However, he is generally stronger and more durable than {{all but a few}} Asgardians, such as Odin and Thor. Like all Asgardians his body is three times more dense and <b>heavy</b> <b>than</b> a human's, contributing partly to his superhuman strength and weight.|$|R
5|$|Heavy metals {{condense}} in planets as {{a result}} of stellar evolution and destruction processes. Stars lose much of their mass when it is ejected late in their lifetimes, and sometimes thereafter {{as a result}} of a neutron star merger, thereby increasing the abundance of elements <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> helium in the interstellar medium. When gravitational attraction causes this matter to coalesce and collapse new stars and planets are formed.|$|E
5|$|In 18th century France, {{there was}} a {{national}} weight standard, the marc de Paris of 8 ounces. The civil pound of 16 ounces was equivalent to 2 marks, {{and it was also}} used as the apothecaries' pound. With 30.6g, the ounces were considerably <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> other apothecaries' ounces in Romance countries, but otherwise the French system was not remarkable. Its history and connections to the English and Flemish standards are discussed below under Weight standards named after Troyes.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the modern}} (English, American and Imperial) troy ounces are roughly 1.5% <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> the late Paris ounce, the exact {{historical}} {{relations between the}} original marc de Troyes, the French poids de marc, the Flemish trooisch pond and the English troy pound are unclear. It is known, however, that the numerical relation between the English and French troy ounces was exactly 64:63 in the 14th century.|$|E

5|$|The Iron Duke-class {{ships were}} 622feet 9inches (189.9metres) long overall, {{and had a}} beam of 90ft (27.4m) and a draught of 29ft (8.8m). This was an {{increase}} of 25ft (7.7m) in length and 1ft (.3m) in width over the preceding King George V-class ships. The Iron Dukes displaced 25,000long tons (25,400tonnes). This was some 2,000tons (2,032tonnes) <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> the preceding King George Vs, and was primarily due {{to the increase in}} calibre of the secondary battery.|$|E
5|$|The J75 {{engine was}} {{slightly}} <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> the PS-13, and therefore required ballast {{to be placed}} in the nose to return the centre of gravity to the correct position. In addition, the Astra fire-control system was not ready, and it too, was replaced by ballast. The otherwise unused weapons bay was loaded with test equipment.|$|E
5|$|The first 94 {{elements}} occur naturally; {{the remaining}} 24, americium to oganesson (95–118) occur only when synthesized in laboratories. Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, 83 are primordial and 11 occur only in decay chains of primordial elements. No element <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> einsteinium (element 99) {{has ever been}} observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, nor has astatine (element 85); francium (element 87) has been only photographed {{in the form of}} light emitted from microscopic quantities (300,000 atoms).|$|E

25|$|Temperatures {{are warm}} to hot {{all year round}} owing to the warm {{currents}} from the North Pacific gyre that surround the island. Rainfall is less <b>heavy</b> <b>than</b> {{in most parts of}} mainland Japan since the island is too far south to be influenced by the Aleutian Low and too far from Asia to receive monsoonal rainfall or orographic precipitation on the equatorward side of the Siberian High.|$|R
50|$|Parahelocoprion is {{estimated}} to have grown to lengths of around 12 m. It was {{once thought to be}} the largest of its family; in 2013, however, a tooth whorl of a large Helicoprion was described, indicating that the genus could grow to larger sizes. The fossils of Parahelicoprion indicate an animal that was overall more slender and less <b>heavy</b> <b>than</b> Helicoprion despite being comparably sized.|$|R
