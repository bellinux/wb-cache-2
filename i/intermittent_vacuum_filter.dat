The PEDOT-PSS/RGO films are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The results indicate that a layer-ordered structure is constructed in this nanocomposite during the <b>vacuum</b> <b>filtering</b> process. The electrochemical performances of the flexible films are characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge/discharge.

This flexible and self-supporting nanocomposite film exhibits excellent cycling stability, and the capacity retention is 90.6  % after 1000  cycles, which shows promising application as high-performance electrode materials for flexible energy-storage devices.|$|R

40|$|THE HIGH {{moisture}} content of mill mud (typically 75 – 80 % for Australian factories) results in high transportation {{costs for the}} redistribution of mud onto cane farms. The high transportation cost relative to the nutrient value of the mill mud results in many milling companies subsidising {{the cost of this}} recycle to ensure a wide distribution across the cane supply area. An average mill would generate about 100 000 t of mud (at 75 % moisture) in a crushing season. The development of mud processing facilities that will produce a low moisture mud that can be effectively incorporated into cane land with existing or modified spreading equipment will improve the cost efficiency of mud redistribution to farms; provide an economical fertiliser alternative to more farms in the supply area; and reduce the potential for adverse environmental impacts from farms.

40|$|Disposal {{of mud and}} ash, {{particularly}} in wet weather conditions, is a significant expense for mills. This paper reports on {{one part of a}} process to pelletise mud and ash, aimed at making mud and ash more attractive to growers across entire mill districts. The full process is described in a separate paper. The part described in this paper involves re-constituting mud cake from the filter station at Tully Mill and processing it in a decanter centrifuge. The material produced by re-constituting and centrifuging is drier and made up of separate particles. The material needs to mix easily with boiler ash, and the mixture needs to be fed easily into a flue gas drier to be dried to low moisture. The results achieved with the particular characteristics of Tully Mill rotary <b>vacuum</b> <b>filter</b> cake are presented. It was found that an internal rotor with a 20 º beach was not adequate to process re-constituted rotary <b>vacuum</b> <b>filter</b> mud. A rotor with a 10 º beach worked much more successfully. A total of four tonnes of centrifuged mud with a moisture content ranging from 60 % to 65 % was produced. It was found that the torque, flocculant rate and dose rate had a statistically significant effect on the moisture content. Feed rate did not have a noticeable impact on the moisture content by itself but torque had a much larger impact on the moisture content at the low feed rate than at the high feed rate. These results indicated that the moisture content of the mud can most likely be reduced with low feed rate, low flocculant rate, high dose rate and high torque. One issue that is believed to affect the operation of a decanter centrifuge was the large quantity of long bagasse fibres in the rotary <b>vacuum</b> <b>filter</b> mud. It is likely that the long fibres limited the throughput of the centrifuge and the moisture achieved...|$|R
