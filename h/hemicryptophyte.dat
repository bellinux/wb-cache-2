40|$|Aerial plant biomass {{has been}} sampled by {{harvesting}} on several sites in fynbos {{communities of the}} south­western Cape Province. Biomass in stands of about two years old ranged from about 2 200 kg per ha to about 7 500 kg per ha. Mature stands comprised about 11 000 to 15 000 kg per ha in heaths and 15 000 to 26 000 kg per ha in sclerophyllous scrub. The data indicate a maximum annual growth rate of 1 000 to 4 000 kg per ha early {{in the development of}} a stand, but growth rates appear to decline rapidly as communities age. Young stands are dominated by <b>hemicryptophytes,</b> which comprise about 2 000 to  6   000 kg per ha, or about 60 to 75 per cent of the biomass in stands of about four years old. Shrubs become prominent later, but the <b>hemicryptophytes</b> persist. The data indicate that the biomass, growth rates and the shape of the growth curves of fynbos communities are on the whole similar to those of analogous vegetation in other zones of mediterranean type climate. However, there are important structural differences in that analogues of the northern hemisphere (garrigue, chaparral) do not have a significant component of persistent hemicrytophytes.

Methods. The species composition of plant communities and their structural and dynamic features have been determined according to biomorphological indicators during the research and post-processing of the collected material. Based on system of Raunkiera K. (1934) there have been identified five major biomes (fanerofity, hamefity, <b>hemicryptophytes,</b> cryptophytes, terofity) of the flora of coastal ecosystem sof Dagestan, without any further specification. Results. <b>Hemicryptophytes</b> numbering 437 species or 43. 52 % of the total species composition have been dominated in the flora of coastal ecosystems of Dagestan. In second place terofity (388 species, or 38. 64 %), the third cryptophytes (80 species or 7. 97 %). Fanerofity and hanefite are respectively 6. 57 % and 3. 68 %.

40|$|A {{total of}} 228 species of {{vascular}} plants from 159 genera and 44 families {{were found in}} various types of weed flora of Mirijevo (NE Belgrade).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of floristic studies conducted in the years 2003 - 2005 within the area of the Polesie National Park. The aim of the research was to compare the flora of initial succession stages in drainage ditches with the flora of neighbouring forest areas undergoing transformation as a result of drainage. Floristic lists were made in four designated study areas as well as in forest phytocoenoses. The results of field investigations were subjected to analysis with regard to the systematic affinity of the flora and proportions of plant life-forms as well as of historical-geographical groups and range groups. In the species composition of the studied drainage ditches <b>hemicryptophytes</b> were the dominant group of plant higher life-forms, whereas in the neighbouring communities the flora was represented by both <b>hemicryptophytes</b> and megaphanerophytes. In historical and geographical terms, the flora of drainage ditches and neighbouring communities represents definitely the group of spontaneophytes.

40|$|Andean grasslands of the La Araucanía Region {{are used}} every year by Pehuenches {{communities}} as forage resources for their livestock. Grazing {{is one of}} the most important disturbances which affect natural meadows and can produce changes at community level in the species richness and plant composition. With the aim of determining the floristic composition of the Andean grasslands in the Alto Bío-Bío National Reserve (37 o S y 70 o W) and its relationship with the cattle load, we studied five sites within the reserve: Cuchares Grande, Cajón Chileno, Tralilhue, Cuchares Chico and Mancha de Pinos. In each site, we sampled 20 random plots recording all the species and their relative cover. We recorded a total of 89 species of vascular plants. Taxonomic richness is represented by two Pteridophyta and 87 Magnoliophyta species. In this last group, 25 species are Liliopsida and 62 are Magnoliopsida. All flora is distributed in 37 families and 72 genera. Greatest families, in species number, are Asteraceae (13), Poaceae (11), Cyperaceae (6) and Rosaceae (6). About the origin, 88 species are native and only 11 are introduced, representing 88 % and 12 %, respectively. Life forms are represented mostly by <b>hemicryptophytes</b> with 53 %, then cryptophytes arround 17 % and finally chamaephytes (15 %). Grasslands wich have greater livestock density, have a higher proportion of introduced species and <b>hemicryptophytes</b> and a greater floristic similarity between them, while those with lower livestock densities have a higher native species proportion. These results suggest that cattle use could have a significant impact in the floristic composition of Andean grasslands. Even though, the low proportion of introduced species found, the high percentage of <b>hemicryptophytes</b> indicates an intermediate level of disturbance...|$|R

At the lower elevations, Megaphanerophytes and Nanophanerophytes were dominant which confirm trees as dominant habit form due to high soil depth, moisture and temperature factors. Data on Leaf spectra in the area showed that Microphyllous (88 spp., 34. 92 %) species were dominant followed by Leptophyllous (74 spp., 29. 36 %) and Nanophyllous (60 spp., 23. 80 %). The Microphyllous plants again are the indicator of cold temperate zone as the area is situated at an elevation of 1191 – 2626 m. Similarly, Nanophylls were dominant at lower elevations. Data on family importance values and diversity among various communities were also recorded.

40|$|The cerrado, {{the second}} largest {{vegetation}} type in Brazil, presents a wide physiognomic range, from grasslands to tall wood-lands, but with most of its physiognomies fitting the definition of tropical savanna. We compiled Raunkiaer’s life-form spectra from cerrado sites and from other vegetation types, comparing them among themselves with ordination analyses. In all cerrado life-form spectra, the main life-form classes were the <b>hemicryptophytes</b> and the phanerophytes, the former prevailing in sites with open physiognomies and the latter prevailing in sites with closed physiognomies. When compared with life-form spectra from other vegetation types, the cerrado sites formed a distinct group, with scores closer {{to those of the}} <b>hemicryptophytes</b> and phanerophytes. The cerrado sites distinguished themselves from the savanna sites by their under-representation of therophytes.
