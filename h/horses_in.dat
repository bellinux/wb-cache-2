5|$|A NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service cull during 2006 and 2007 in Kosciuszko National Park, {{where there}} were an {{estimated}} 1700 <b>horses</b> <b>in</b> 2005, resulted in a reduction of 64 horses.|$|E
5|$|Although {{machinery}} {{has replaced}} <b>horses</b> <b>in</b> {{many parts of}} the world, an estimated 100million horses, donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas. This number includes around 27million working animals in Africa alone. Some land management practices such as cultivating and logging can be efficiently performed with <b>horses.</b> <b>In</b> agriculture, less fossil fuel is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time with the use of draft animals such as horses. Logging with horses can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.|$|E
5|$|Dunn's {{training}} facility, Bud Dunn Stables, (later Bud Dunn and Son Stables) was in Florence, Alabama, on a ten-acre property. Dunn {{moved to}} north Alabama from Georgia in the 1950s, and bought out another trainer who was quitting the horse business. By the mid-1980s, Dunn had over 50 <b>horses</b> <b>in</b> training at a time, and had several full-time employees. He also judged Tennessee Walking Horse shows, including the Spring Celebration, an annual Tennessee Walking Horse show in Shelbyville, Tennessee that is traditionally popular with trainers {{who hope to}} enter <b>horses</b> <b>in</b> the National Celebration later in the year.|$|E

5|$|The Okanogan Valley was the {{traditional}} homeland of the Syilx (also called Okanogan) Native Americans, whose territory extended north {{into what is}} now Canada. The Syilx acquired <b>horses</b> <b>in</b> the mid-18th century, which helped them expand northward. They first met non-native traders and missionaries in the early 19th century. The Syilx participated in trade fairs held at Kettle Falls and {{at the mouth of}} the Fraser River.

5|$|The general {{drivability}} test {{is performed}} by trotter stallions.

5|$|There {{are still}} working brewery <b>horses</b> <b>in</b> other areas, such as Wadworth Brewery's Shire <b>horses</b> <b>in</b> Devizes, Wiltshire, but working teams are {{becoming}} increasingly rare. In some areas, such as the New Forest, local farmers and commoners use horses to round up thousands of semi-feral ponies grazing on the open Forest during the drift season, and Britain's mounted police use <b>horses</b> <b>in</b> crowd control, but other than such niche areas, the horse in Britain today is kept almost entirely for recreational purposes. They compete in all equestrian disciplines, carry riders from novice to advanced on trekking and trail-riding holidays, work in riding schools, provide therapy for the disabled, and are much-loved companions and hacks. The horses and riders of Great Britain have won numerous medals for eventing in equestrian sports at the Summer Olympic Games.|$|E

5|$|Horse {{improvement}} as a goal, {{and horse}} breeding as an enterprise, date to medieval times; King John imported a hundred Flemish stallions, Edward III imported fifty Spanish stallions, and various priories and abbeys owned stud farms. Laws were passed restricting and prohibiting horse exports {{and for the}} culling of horses considered undesirable in type. By the 17th century, specific horse breeds were being recorded as suitable for specific purposes, and new horse-drawn agricultural machinery was being designed. Fast coaches pulled by teams of horses with Thoroughbred blood could make use of improved roads, and coaching inn proprietors owned hundreds of horses to support the trade. Steam power took {{over the role of}} <b>horses</b> <b>in</b> agriculture from the mid-19th century, but horses continued to be used in warfare for almost another 100 years, as their speed and agility over rough terrain remained unequalled. Working horses had all but disappeared from Britain by the 1980s, and today <b>horses</b> <b>in</b> Britain are kept almost wholly for recreational purposes.|$|E

5|$|<b>Horses</b> <b>in</b> the Middle Ages {{differed}} in size, build and breed from the modern horse, and were, on average, smaller. They {{were also more}} central to society than their modern counterparts, being essential for war, agriculture, and transport.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there were}} exceptions; in the 7th century a Merovingian kingdom still {{retained}} {{at least one}} active Roman horse breeding centre. The Spanish also retained many quality <b>horses,</b> <b>in</b> {{part due to the}} historic reputation of the region as a horse-breeding land, and partially due to the cultural influences related to the Islamic conquest of the Iberian peninsula between the 8th and 15th centuries.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, the Jockey Club and {{the owners}} of the General Stud Book passed a {{regulation}} named by the foreign press after the Jockey Club's senior steward, Lord Jersey, prohibiting the registration of <b>horses</b> <b>in</b> the book unless all of their ancestors had been registered. Despite protests from American breeders, the regulation remained in force until 1949. Among the factors influencing its relaxation were the racing success of ineligible <b>horses</b> <b>in</b> Europe and the damage caused to British and Irish breeders by the unavailability of French Thoroughbreds during and after the Second World War. In addition, by 1949 the possibly impure ancestors of the American bloodlines had receded far back in most horses' ancestry.|$|E
50|$|To mount, {{the rider}} {{should take the}} leading rein (presumably there was a third rein for leading the <b>horse)</b> <b>in</b> {{his left hand and}} hold it slack.

5|$|Porter was {{interested}} in reforming the sport of horse racing, and expended much effort in the newspaper trying to bring together horsemen in the {{various parts of the}} country. Although the effort did not bear fruit, the Spirit became a repository for information of interest to those involved in horse racing, printing statistics and results of races. Porter was also involved in attempts to publish an American stud book for race <b>horses</b> <b>in</b> the United States, similar to the General Stud Book that was published in England documenting the pedigrees of Thoroughbred <b>horses.</b> <b>In</b> February 1837, Porter announced in the Spirit the projected coverage of the project, which was to be edited by Wiley Jones Stratton, who was secretary to the National Jockey Club in Washington, D. C. But this project never materialized, and Porter turned to Patrick Nesbitt Edgar in January 1838 to take over the project. But Edgar did not finish the work, and by 1842, the project was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Purebred Arabians never carry {{dilution}} genes. Therefore, purebreds {{cannot be}} colors such as dun, cremello, palomino or buckskin. However, there is pictorial evidence from pottery and tombs in Ancient Egypt suggesting that spotting patterns may have existed on ancestral Arabian-type <b>horses</b> <b>in</b> antiquity. Nonetheless, purebred Arabians today do not carry genes for pinto or Leopard complex ("Appaloosa") spotting patterns, except for sabino.|$|E
