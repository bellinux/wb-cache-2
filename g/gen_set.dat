Improper management and poor control measures in this sector could lead to negative impacts to the environment such as air pollution, noise pollution, dust problem; solid and hazardous waste disposal and human health. Therefore this study was undertaken to identify significant environmental aspects and impacts of piling and foundation works, which is an early phase for any construction project. Identification of environmental aspects and impacts is very important in decision making to reduce the risk and possible impact at early stage of a construction process. Significant environmental aspects and impacts were identified using both qualitative and quantitative methods 1. There were thirty one (31) environmental aspects from filing and foundation works identified. The most significant aspects were the activities from the drilling process, transportation, machinery activities and generator set (<b>gen</b> <b>set)</b> operation.

40|$|Diesel {{generating}} set load acceptance performance has deteriorated {{in recent years}} due {{to a number of}} influencing factors. Market forces have demanded that a higher power output is achieved for a given engine displacement, whilst global concern and awareness of climate change has led to the introduction of increasingly stringent emissions legislation. In order to provide satisfactory load acceptance performance, whilst maintaining compliance with the growing restrictions placed on operation, more sophisticated control and protection features are required than would be provided with the traditional standby diesel gen-set package. Presently, diesel gen-set control involves limited interaction between the automatic. voltage regulator (AVR) and engine speed governor, causing issues to arise due to the absence of a co-ordinated control scheme. For example, {{in the event of a}} large real power load application, a fast responding AVR can cause excessive engine speed deviation, which may be unacceptable in some applications. The problem is further exacerbated by the introduction of fuel limiting as a method of achieving emissions compliance, restricting the action of the engine speed governor during a transient. This has prompted the research to investigate integration of the various components of a modern diesel gen-set control system. A co-ordinated control approach, in which the AVR aids transient engine speed recovery, has therefore been developed. Testing and evaluation of the integrated diesel gen-set control system was conducted on diesel gen-sets in the Queen's University of Belfast test facility. A number of different integrated control configurations were evaluated to determine the available ifTIprovement in diesel <b>gen</b> <b>set</b> load acceptance performance. The thesis presents results showing that, by utilising a co-ordinated control strategy, a significant overall improvement in the maximum initial load application is achieved, thus meeting market expectation whilst remaining fully emissions compliant.

40|$|An {{electrical}} vehicle {{environment was}} established to promote research and technology development {{in the area of}} high power energy management. The project incorporates a topology that permits parallel development of an alternative energy delivery system and an energy storage system. The objective of the project is to develop technologies, specifically power electronics, energy storage electronics and controls that provide efficient and effective energy management between electrically powered devices in alternative energy vehicles â plugin electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, range extended vehicles, and hydrogen-based fuel cell vehicles. In order to meet the project objectives, the Vehicle Energy Management System (VEMS) was defined and subsystem requirements were obtained. Afterwards, power electronics, energy storage electronics and controls were designed. Finally, these subsystems were built, tested individually, and integrated into an electric vehicle system to evaluate and optimize the subsystemsâ performance. Phase 1 of the program established the fundamental test bed to support development of an electrical environment ideal for fuel cell application and the mitigation of many shortcomings of current fuel cell technology. Phase 2, continued development from Phase 1, focusing on implementing subsystem requirements, design and construction of the energy management subsystem, and the integration of this subsystem into the surrogate electric vehicle. Phase 2 also required the development of an Alternative Energy System (AES) capable of emulating electrical characteristics of fuel cells, battery, <b>gen</b> <b>set,</b> etc. Under the scope of the project, a boost converter that couples the alternate energy delivery system to the energy storage system was developed, constructed and tested. Modeling tools were utilized during the design process to optimize both component and system design. This model driven design process enabled an iterative process to track and evaluate the impact of design alternatives and the impact of changes. Refinement of models was accomplished through correlation studies to measured data obtained from functioning hardware. Specifically, correlation and characterization of the boost converter resulted in a model that was effectively used to determine overall VEMS performance. The successful development of the boost converter can be attributed to utilization of previously proven technologies and adapting to meet the VEMS requirements. This program provided significant improvement in development time of various generations of boost converters. The software strategies and testing results support the development of current energy management systems and directly contribute to the future of similar, commercial products at Magna E-Car Systems. Because of this development project, Magna E-Car Systems is able to offer automotive customers a boost converter system with reduced time to market and decreased product cost, thus transferring the cost and timing benefits to the end use consumer...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Development and Management Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Energy {{is central}} to {{economic}} development. It has been established {{that there is a}} clear correlation between energy consumption and living standards. Nigeria is a country of very industrious and enterprising people. However, due to non availability of adequate energy in the country, especially in the remote, off grid locations, the entrepreneurial inclination of the average Nigerian living in these locations has been largely stunted. Over the years, successive governments in the country, in realisation of the pivotal role of energy in national development, have explored various options to improve energy supply and availability, but the situation has not experienced any remarkable improvement. This has forced many businesses and households to resort to self provision through generators, often at exorbitant costs. This research work addresses the challenge of energy in remote, off grid locations by appraising the techno economic potential of renewable energy, using Obudu Ranch as a case study. This ranch is the foremost tourism resort in Nigeria, and has played host to a number of international events over the years. Presently, electricity is being generated through the use of diesel powered generating sets. The adjoining communities are currently without electricity, although a few of the residents have acquired generators for self provision, mostly for their domestic use. Aside the high cost associated with this, the discharge of noxious contaminants into the atmosphere is undesirable. The research entailed a working collaboration with some notable Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) that have done extensive ground work in the area for access to some secondary data, {{as well as a number}} of corporate and governmental agencies that are relevant to the study. Further, the ranch was visited to establish hands-on, the existing renewable energy sources. A trade-off of these sources was carried out with reference to a number of relevant evaluation parameters to identify the most suited option for addressing the energy challenge. A comparative analysis of this selected source was then made to establish its techno economic potential against the existing source of power generation- diesel powered generating sets, which currently costs R 1. 5 million annually in running expenses. The findings from this research have established that a Renewable Energy source (mini hydro) is a more cost effective option than the diesel powered <b>gen</b> <b>set,</b> providing a 43 % reduction in cost of energy generation, and a 42 % reduction in the life cycle cost over the five year of analysis, compared to the status quo. In addition, it is also more environmentally friendly.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Drilling, {{the act of}} {{creating}} a hole by removing material with a drill gloss tool is also {{carried out in the}} petroleum industry, but this is done {{with the aid of a}} drilling rig for the creation of a wellbore (hole) with the sole aim of the recovery of petroleum resources(oil and gas in this case). The drilling rig which is used to carry out this drilling operation is divided into 5 (five) systems they include: •	Hoisting system: This is the part of the drilling rig the helps increment in the wellbore depth they includes the hoisting tower structure i. e. the mast and derrick, the substructure, the draw works(hoist), the derrick line and its accessories and finally the travelling and crown block. •	Circulating system: This is the path in which mud and cuttings pass through during the drilling process so as to enhance a better rate of penetration (ROP) by suspension of cuttings ensuring that bit cuts a fresh surface while rotating, they include the stand pipe, Kelly hose, the drill stem, the annulus, the mud return line, the shale shaker, the mud pit. •	Rotary system: This system aids in the rotary action which aids drilling, ensuring a better rate of penetration (ROP), they include the swivel, Kelly, rotary drive and rotary table •	Power system: This system provides all the necessary power to carry out the drilling work; this is basically the <b>Gen</b> <b>set</b> and any other power generating equipment. •	Well control and monitoring system: this system basically helps to monitor the drilling operation, drilling a well is very dangerous, because the pressure in the reservoir could be significant high, which normally about couple thousands psi. The main part of this system is the blowout preventer(BOP) Drilling operation on the rig is carried out with the aid of drilling mud, the need for drilling mud in drilling operation cannot be over emphasized, and some of the uses of drilling mud include: •	Suspension/removal of cuttings from well, •	Control formation pressure, •	Seal permeable formations, •	Maintain wellbore stability, •	Minimize formation damage, •	Cool, lubricate, and support the bit and drilling assembly, •	Transmit hydraulic energy to tools and bit, •	Ensure adequate formation evaluation, •	Prevent inflow of formation fluid thereby preventing a kick, etc But the properties of drilling mud is dependent on the formation parameters, a drilling mud with a density of 8. 5 ppg despite being the API standard can’t be used to drill a formation of 10 ppg else caving in of the wellbore would occur thereby causing destruction of equipments, waste of time, and the need for a remedial operation such as sidetracking to be done which would require more funds for the operation, therefore the drilling mud used at any depth should be dependent of formation conditions at that depth. The properties of the drilling mud can be altered via the use of drilling mud additives, depending on the property needed to be increased. The mud weight/density can be increased to meet the well depth condition with the addition of weighter, example of a weighters include Haematite, Barite, etc these additives would help increase the mud weight to the needed weight, likewise, if the PH of our drilling mud needs to be increased in a case where by we are drilling through an acidic formation, additives which increase the ph of mud (PH Enhancers) can be used, examples of PH enhancers are potassium hydroxide(KOH), Sodium Hydroxide(NAOH), etc, there are also other parameters of drilling mud that can be altered such as viscosity, filtration, Gel strength etc...|$|E

EV1 prototypes were sometimes attached with [...] "range-extender" [...] trailers, developed by Alan Cocconi of AC Propulsion. These trailers were simply rolling <b>gen</b> <b>sets</b> that could supply power for long trips.

40|$|The {{impact of}} extent of genetic {{relatedness}} on accuracy of genome-enabled predictions {{was assessed using}} a dairy cattle population and alternative cross-validation (CV) strategies were compared. The CV layouts consisted of training and testing sets obtained from either random allocation of individuals (RAN) or from a kernel-based clustering of individuals using the additive relationship matrix, to obtain two subsets that were as unrelated as possible (UNREL), {{as well as a}} layout based on stratification by generation (GEN). The UNREL layout decreased the average genetic relationships between training and testing animals but produced similar accuracies to the RAN design, which were about 15 % higher than in the <b>GEN</b> <b>setting.</b> Results indicate that the CV structure can have an important effect on the accuracy of whole-genome predictions. However, the connection between average genetic relationships across training and testing sets and the estimated predictive ability is not straightforward, and may depend also on the kind of relatedness that exists between the two subsets and on the heritability of the trait. For high heritability traits, close relatives such as parents and full sibs make the greatest contributions to accuracy, which can be compensated by half-sibs or grandsires in the case of lack of close relatives. However, for the low heritability traits the inclusion of close relatives is crucial and including more relatives of various types in the training set tends to lead to greater accuracy. In practice, cross-validation designs should resemble the intended use of the predictive models, e. g. within or between family predictions, or within or across generation predictions, such that estimation of predictive ability is consistent with the actual application to be considered...|$|R

The attack was made and the Union forces held down one Rebel corps there {{for the rest of the}} day. On the afternoon of December 15, the Federal blow fell on General Hood’s left flank, as General A. J. Smith’s three divisions from the Army of the Tennessee and General James H. Wilson’s Cavalry Corps, a total of 24,000 troops, swept over the redoubts and into A. P. Stewart’s flank. In addition to this flanking force, General Thomas Wood’s IV Corps and Schofield’s Army of the Ohio, yet another 24,000 Union troops, stood ready to move against Stewart’s center. As Stewart’s Corps fought for its life, Hood ordered twodivisions, those of Edward Johnson and William B. Bate, to support his beleaguered left. While Edward Johnson’s Division was engaged that afternoon as Stewart’s line crumbled, Bate’s Division did little good, as it failed to even begin its march west until after sunset. William McLeod remembered “went around & reenforced on the left & we got their after night & we commenced our breast works[...] [...] [...]” Arriving on the left flank, Hood posted Bate’s small division atop Compton’s Hill, a knoll that guarded the northeast-southwest running Granny White Pike, one of Hood’s lines of retreat. By this time it was dark and fighting stopped for the day. Although battered and with a much smaller battle line, Gen. Hood was still confident. He established a main line of resistance along the base of a ridge about two miles south of the former location, throwing up new works and fortifying Compton's and Overton’s hills on their flanks. The Federal IV Army Corps marched out to within 250 yards, in some places, of the Confederate’s new line and began constructing fieldworks.|$|R
