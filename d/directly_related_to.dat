5|$|Aqil's father, Musa Agha al-Hasi, {{himself a}} {{commander}} of Hawwara irregulars {{in the service}} of Acre's Ottoman governors, had left Egypt for Gaza in 1814. He was not <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the Ainawiyeh or Hawwara tribes, but claimed descent from the Hawwara as a matter of convenience and prestige. Musa originally hailed from the al-Bara'asa tribe of Cyrenaica (modern-day eastern Libya). Likewise, James Finn, the British consul in Jerusalem (1846–1863), claims Aqil's family was of Algerian or North African origin. Musa Agha resided in the Galilee around 1820 and married a Turkmen woman. Aqil was born to the couple in the Nazareth area. According to historian Adel Manna, Aqil was born in Gaza. Musa had two other sons, Ali and Salih. Musa died in Gaza in 1830.|$|E
5|$|Bedell {{sponsored}} several bold initiatives {{during his}} tenure in the United States House of Representatives. One initiative, which came from his constituents' problems with the barge industry, focused on waterway usage fees. He introduced legislation in 1977 {{that would require the}} barge industry to pay a fee for using the waterways which, Bedell pointed out, the Government paid millions of dollars to create and maintain. Bedell's original plan set the rate the barge industry paid as <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the amount the Government spent on waterway projects. This would have the additional effect of helping curb unnecessary waterway projects, and it was the same plan proposed by Pete Domenici in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|In special relativity, {{energy is}} closely {{connected}} to momentum. Just as {{space and time}} are, in that theory, different aspects of a more comprehensive entity called spacetime, energy and momentum are merely different aspects of a unified, four-dimensional quantity that physicists call four-momentum. In consequence, if energy {{is a source of}} gravity, momentum must be a source as well. The same is true for quantities that are <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> energy and momentum, namely internal pressure and tension. Taken together, in general relativity it is mass, energy, momentum, pressure and tension that serve as sources of gravity: they are how matter tells spacetime how to curve. In the theory's mathematical formulation, all these quantities are but aspects of a more general physical quantity called the energy–momentum tensor.|$|E

5|$|Reviewing {{the book}}, Charles E. Osgood {{classified}} {{the book as}} a graduate-level text based more on objective facts than on theoretical constructs. He thought the book was verbose on some topics and too brief on others not <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the author's expertise area. He was also critical of Miller's use of simple, Skinnerian single-stage stimulus-response learning to explain human language acquisition and use. This approach, per Osgood, {{made it impossible to}} analyze the concept of meaning, and the idea of language consisting of representational signs. He did find the book objective in its emphasis on facts over theory, and depicting clearly application of information theory to psychology.|$|E
5|$|Several {{relativistic}} {{effects are}} <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the relativity of direction. One is geodetic precession: the axis {{direction of a}} gyroscope in free fall in curved spacetime will change when compared, for instance, with the direction of light received from distant stars—even though such a gyroscope represents the way of keeping a direction as stable as possible ("parallel transport"). For the Moon–Earth system, this effect has been measured {{with the help of}} lunar laser ranging. More recently, it has been measured for test masses aboard the satellite Gravity Probe B to a precision of better than 0.3%.|$|E
