5|$|Paul meets an old friend, Kim Taylor (Jenny Young), and learns he is {{the father}} of her sons David (Takaya Honda) and Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano). Paul and Kim manage to stop Amy and Leo from consummating their relationship. David bonds with Paul soon after, {{although}} Leo stays away from him due to their business rivalry, but eventually comes to accept Paul as his father. Paul tries to pursue a relationship with Terese, but she rejects him and later gets engaged to Gary. After receiving compensation from the Quill group, Paul buys and moves back into the Lassiter's Penthouse, with Amy and Jimmy. Terese confides in Paul that she has breast cancer, and <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>his</b> best to support her. However, once it is obvious that her chemotherapy is not working, Terese visits her brother Nick in prison, who is later granted bail with the help of Clive Gibbons (Geoff Paine), much to Paul's chagrin. Paul soon learns that Amy and Nick are dating. In addition, Paul and Leo are bought out of Robinsons after Amy encourages Steph to help Nick set up a wellness centre in the premises. Paul and Terese have sex, but she chooses to stay with Gary. After attempting to give Nick money to leave town, Paul frames him by having someone plant stolen medication in Nick's hotel room, resulting in his parole being revoked. Amy is furious to discover that Paul has set Nick up, and when Paul does not confess his crime to the police, she and Jimmy move back into No. 26. After Terese makes it clear that she and Paul will never be in a relationship, and Amy refuses to move back into the penthouse, Paul decides to leave Erinsborough for a few weeks supposedly to visit his family in New York City, but David reveals that Paul never arrived. Paul returns a few weeks later and reveals he is engaged to Courtney Grixti (Emma Lane). He also buys Mr Udagawa's (Lawrence Mah) share of Lassiters making him Terese's boss.|$|E
25|$|Captain Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) is {{the head}} of the Homicide Division of the San Francisco Police Department. He and Monk have been good friends since Monk was on the police force, and he {{continues}} to be Monk's friend throughout the series. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>his</b> best to help Monk but is occasionally annoyed by Monk's phobias and the damage they can cause. In the first two seasons, Stottlemeyer is reluctant to work with Monk, seemingly annoyed by the idea that he could not handle his cases himself. By seasons three and four, his faith in Monk's contribution is well-cemented and his collaboration unquestionable.|$|E
25|$|Carroll {{sees this}} {{societal}} belief as vital {{in interpreting the}} final scene of the play, arguing that Valentine does give Silvia to Proteus, and in so doing, he is merely acting {{in accordance with the}} practices of the day. However, if one accepts that Valentine does not give Silvia to Proteus, as critics such as Jeffrey Masten argue, but instead offers to love Proteus as much as he loves Silvia, then the conclusion of the play can be read as a final triumphant reconciliation between friendship and love; Valentine intends to love his friend as much as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>his</b> betrothed. Love and friendship are shown to be co-existent, not exclusive.|$|E

Myths and legends begin to surround that kind of person.|$|E
500|$|David McNaughton argues that, {{even if the}} agent's {{commitment}} to his/her principles is not undermined, two-level utilitarianism does not succeed in its goal of showing, [...] "how, on utilitarian principles, {{it is a good}} idea to think and reason in a pluralist and non-consequentialist manner." [...] It is impossible, he claims, to compartmentalise one's thinking in the way the two-level account requiresâ€”to simultaneously think like a utilitarian and act in a non-utilitarian way. Hare's response to this type of criticism is that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>his</b> own moral thinking in this way, therefore the challenge that this type of moral thinking is impossible must be false.|$|E
500|$|Benson {{considers}} {{the most obvious}} theme of the novel to be good versus evil. Parker agrees, and highlights a conversation between Bond and Matthis in the chapter titled [...] "The Nature of Evil", in which Bond says: [...] "By... evil existence... he was creating a norm of badness by which, and by which alone, an opposite norm of goodness could exist." [...] The subject was also dealt with by the academic Beth Butterfield, in an examination of Bond from an existentialist viewpoint. In light of Bond's conversation, Butterfield identifies a crisis of confidence in Bond's character, where he has [...] "moved beyond good and evil" [...] {{to the point where}} <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>his</b> job not because of principles, but to pursue personal battles. Eco comes to the same conclusion, stating that Bond [...] "abandon the treacherous life of moral mediation and of psychological anger, with all the dangers they entail." ...|$|E

500|$|Downes {{said that}} his voicing for Master Chief was based entirely on Bungie's written {{character}} description provided, which specified a character similar to Clint Eastwood and of few words. In a podcast interview, the actor noted that, during the recording, {{he was given a}} fair amount of creative leeway to develop the Chief's personality. In the games, Master Chief never speaks during player-controlled gameplay, making him an almost silent protagonist. Even during cut scenes, the character generally speaks sparingly. Bungie Studios' Frank O'Connor has described the Chief as [...] "so quiet and so invisible, literally, that the player gets to pretend they're the Chief. The player gets to inhabit those shoes [...] apply their own personality." [...] Bungie concept artist Eddie Smith described Master Chief as [...] "pretty much the consummate professional. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>his</b> job, walks off, doesn't even get the girl, he's that cool he doesn't need her." [...] Although the Master Chief is usually depicted as calm, quiet, and wryly cynical, some reviewers stated that Eric Nylund's portrayal of the character in Halo: The Fall of Reach deviates significantly from the treatment found in the games and other media. Alternatively, William C. Dietz's portrayal of the Chief in [...] was occasionally blasted by fans as too radical a departure from Nylund's template.|$|E

I do not think this is vanity or fickleness so much as a pugnacious dispostion, that must have an antagonist power to contend with, and only finds itself at ease in systematic opposition." ...|$|E

Randi highlighted a quotation from the November 2007 issue of the magazine Magische Welt (Magic World) in which Geller said: [...] "I'll no longer say that I have supernatural powers.

[...] In a later interview, Geller told Telepolis, [...] "I said to this German magazine, so what I did say, that I changed my character, {{to the best of my}} recollection, and I no longer say that I do supernatural things. It doesn't mean that I don't have powers. It means that I don't say 'it's supernatural', I say 'I'm a mystifier!' That's what I said. And the skeptics turned it around and said, 'Uri Geller said he's a magician!' I never said that."
