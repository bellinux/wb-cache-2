5|$|In the comedic poem Þrymskviða, Thor again plays {{a central}} role. In the poem, Thor wakes and finds that his {{powerful}} hammer, Mjöllnir, is missing. Thor turns to Loki, {{and tells him}} that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen. The two go to the dwelling of the goddess Freyja, and so that he may attempt to find Mjöllnir, Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak. Freyja agrees, and says she would lend it to Thor <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> made of silver or gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling.|$|E
5|$|Due to the state's {{worsening}} economy, {{the primary}} issue facing the legislature for the session was a $456 million budget shortfall. Expanded gambling was again proposed {{as a possible}} source of revenue, and a bill to allow slot machines at the state's racetracks passed the House Licensing and Occupations Committee, but died in the House Appropriations and Revenue Committee. Speaker Stumbo expressed doubt that he had enough votes to pass the measure <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> brought to the House floor. Instead, the Assembly passed a series of tax bills {{to deal with the}} shortfall. The Assembly also began the process of reforming the state's system of school accountability testing, a move advocated by Beshear. Other bills passed during the session revised the state road plan to allocate newly available federal stimulus funds, created a program to divert accused substance abusers to treatment before their trials, and created a statewide database for tracking payday loans.|$|E
5|$|In 1544 Henry VIII bequeathed {{the castle}} to Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, but the {{property}} continued to decline. By the 1570s the castle and its earthworks {{had been allowed}} to become infested with rabbits, whose warrens caused extensive damage; a survey suggested that fully renovating the castle would cost £2,000, and that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> pulled down and sold for the value of its materials, it would only realise £66. At the end of the century, the inner bailey was finally cleared of most of its buildings; the new lodgings were pulled down, along with most of the west range and the old Norman chapel, leaving only the ruined keep, alongside the latrines and the newer chapel, although what these last two were then used for is uncertain. The foundations of the old chapel were slowly covered up by the earth defences.|$|E

5|$|The {{church was}} said to have been rebuilt, after serious fire damage, around 1257–1265, though whether this was a rebuilding, or a {{continuation}} of work commenced after 1246, is unclear. It is not inconceivable that the fire damage was caused when, in 1256, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, with a large army, seized Llanbadarn Fawr from Norman control. Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster, son of King Henry III and brother of King Edward I, was Lord of Cardigan from 1265. Given the size of the church it is probable that construction took many years, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> not interrupted. If it commenced in 1246 it is quite conceivable that work was not complete until 1265, or later.|$|E

25|$|The {{sentencing}} statutes in the United States Code {{that cover}} controlled substances are notoriously intricate. For example, a first-time offender convicted {{in a single}} proceeding for selling marijuana three times, and found to have carried a gun on him all three times (<b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> not used) is subject to a minimum sentence of 55 years in federal prison.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{that he did}} consider practical was tightened government fiscal policy, based on using tax revenue to reduce the national debt. Tightened fiscal policy would {{have the effect of}} slowing economic growth, thereby slowing coal consumption, at least until the debt was erased. Still, Jevons admitted that the overall impact of such a measure, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> implemented, would be minimal. In short, the prospect that society would voluntarily reduce consumption was dim.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} in diagram 4 {{is an example}} of a pawn drawing against a queen.

(White may be able to win the resulting queen versus queen ending, however, if the white king is close enough).|$|E

25|$|The {{reasons for}} revelation were both {{political}} and practical. The cost over-runs of the project were now so enormous (approximately £1 billion by 1979) that the secret inner-Cabinet spending approvals could not continue. The key decision to proceed had been taken in 1975, four years previously, and cancellation {{would be unlikely to}} save money at that point. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> to be cancelled, a replacement would have to be ordered in any case. Shortly afterwards the Thatcher government decided that the successor system should be the Trident system and ordered the C4 variant.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the thyroid}} clinic, Campos {{likewise}} pursued research on {{whether there was}} a genetic factor that contributed to endemic goiter. His findings, as contained in a paper that he published in 1961, proposed that the iodine intake deficiency thought to be the main cause of goiter {{was just one of the}} triggering factors of the disease, and that physiology and anatomy proved to be more important considerations as some people were born without the enzyme necessary to take in trace elements such as iodine <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> present in food and water.|$|E

25|$|Churchill {{then moved}} for summary {{judgement}} {{on the remaining}} claim, arguing {{that she had been}} fired without a determination that she had been engaging in protected speech on a matter of public concern, and that her rights to freedom of association with Dr. Koch had also been abridged, in violation of her due process rights. The defendants cross-moved for the same, arguing failure to state a claim on the free-association claim. They denied she had been engaging in protected speech, and that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were,</b> she would still have been fired for undermining the hospital administration.|$|E
25|$|Robert E. Lee {{knew that}} if the Union Army could take Five Forks, {{they would be able}} to reach the South Side Railroad and the Richmond and Danville Railroad, cutting the major supply routes to and retreat routes from Petersburg and Richmond, cut the wagon roads to the west and circle around Hatcher's Run and attack the Confederate right flank. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> not the best {{location}} for a defense, Five Forks had to be defended. Pickett later wrote that he assumed Lee had his message and would make a helpful diversion and send reinforcements.|$|E
25|$|In Bracton's time, the {{question}} frequently arose about land held in frankalmoign (land {{donated to the}} Church). Writs were common prohibiting Church courts from meddling into the title of land, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> {{to be held in}} frankalmoign. The question was that of lay fee, which was the equivalent of secular lands, even though it may have been held in free, pure and perpetual alms. Bracton posited that land which is sacred (housing Churches and the like) was within the jurisdiction of the Church. To this could be added lands donated {{in the form of a}} dower. A glance of the plea rolls demonstrates them to be covered with writs of prohibitions directed at ecclesiastical judges in a continuous battle over jurisdiction of Church lands.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, {{the member}} states {{established}} Luxembourg as the permanent seat of the Court. Future judicial bodies (Court of First Instance and Civil Service Tribunal) would also be based in the city. The decision was confirmed by the European Council at Edinburgh in 1992. However, there was no reference to future bodies being in Luxembourg. In reaction to this, the Luxembourgian government issued its own declaration stating it did not surrender those provisions agreed upon in 1965. The Edinburgh decision {{was attached to the}} Amsterdam Treaty. With the Treaty of Nice Luxembourg attached a declaration stating it did not claim the seat of the Boards of Appeal of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market – <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> to become a judicial body.|$|E
25|$|By comparison, {{the first}} {{plutonium}} core nuclear device {{tested by the}} United States (Trinity test) had a yield of 20 kilotons of TNT, and the first nuclear device detonated by India in 1974, though of primitive design, had a yield {{in the region of}} 8 kilotons of TNT. If the North Korean nuclear test is less than even a kiloton in yield, it would be a historically small inaugural nuclear test. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> as many as the reported intentional yield of 4 kt it would be the smallest nuclear test ever conducted by a state as a first test. Some advanced nuclear powers have produced very small tactical nuclear weapons in the low-kiloton range, but their development is far more technologically challenging than that of weapons in the 15–20 kiloton range, requiring advanced weapons materials and core geometries.|$|E
25|$|A {{second group}} put their main {{emphasis}} {{on tax cuts}} rather than spending cuts or debt reduction. Many embrace supply-side economics, arguing that as high taxes discourage economic activity and investment, tax cuts would result in economic growth leading in turn to higher government revenues. These additional government revenues, would {{in the long term}} reduce debt, they also argue for reducing taxes <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> to lead to short term increases in the deficit. Some supply-siders have even advocated that the increases in revenue through tax cuts make drastic cuts in spending unnecessary. However, the Congressional Budget Office has consistently reported that income tax cuts increase deficits and debt and do not pay for themselves. For example, the CBO estimated that the Bush tax cuts added about $1.5 trillion to deficits and debt from 2002-2011 and would have added nearly $3 trillion to deficits and debt over the 2010-2019 decade if fully extended at all income levels.|$|E
