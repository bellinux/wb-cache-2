5|$|At the {{procession}} to George's lying in state in Westminster Hall {{part of the}} Imperial State Crown fell from {{on top of the}} coffin and landed in the gutter as the cortège turned into New Palace Yard. The new king, Edward VIII, saw <b>it</b> <b>fall</b> and wondered whether it was a bad omen for his new reign. As a mark of respect to their father, George's four surviving sons, Edward, Albert, Henry, and George, mounted the guard, known as the Vigil of the Princes, at the catafalque on the night before the funeral. The vigil was not repeated until the death of George's daughter-in-law, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, in 2002. George V was interred at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 28 January 1936. Edward abdicated before the year was out, leaving his brother Albert, Duke of York, to ascend the throne (taking the regnal name George VI).|$|E
5|$|In quick succession, Hermione, Troezen and Epidaurus {{surrendered}} to Cleomenes, who went from Argos to Corinth and started besieging the citadel. He sent a messenger to Aratus proposing that Acrocorinth should be garrisoned jointly {{by both the}} Spartans and the Achaeans, {{and that he would}} deliver a twelve talent pension. Aratus faced the hard decision of whether to give the city to Antigonus or to let <b>it</b> <b>fall</b> to Cleomenes. He chose to conclude an alliance with Antigonus and sent his son as a hostage to Macedon. Cleomenes invaded the territory of Sicyon and blockaded Aratus inside the city for three months before Aratus was able to escape to attend the Achaean council at Aegium.|$|E

5|$|The Ottomans first landed 15 {{miles west}} of Canea (Chania), where the local militia fled before them. They then {{attacked}} the small island fortress of St. Todero, the commander of which, the Istrian Blasio Zulian, blew himself, the fortress and its garrison up rather than let <b>it</b> <b>fall</b> to the Ottomans. The Ottoman army next advanced {{to the city of}} Canea itself, which fell on 22 August, after a siege that lasted for 56 days. At the same time, however, the Venetians were strengthened, as the promised help started to arrive in the form of galleys from the Papal States, Tuscany, Malta and Naples. In September, the Ottoman fleet was in disarray, but the allied Christian fleet, under the cautious command of Niccolò Ludovisi, the Pope's nephew, failed to exploit the opportunity for a decisive strike. When the Christian forces finally moved to retake Canea on 1 October, with a fleet of about 90 ships, the stout Ottoman defense and the Allies' lack of cooperation doomed the attack. Soon thereafter, the Venetian allies returned to their bases.|$|E

25|$|In the TV movie Is <b>It</b> <b>Fall</b> Yet?, several celebrities {{provided}} guest voices.

Though Daria is hesitant to accept Tom at first, she and Tom find themselves becoming closer, culminating in a kiss in the season finale. The emotional and comedic turmoil among Jane, Tom and Daria was the centerpiece of the TV movie Is <b>It</b> <b>Fall</b> Yet?, and the relationship between Tom and Daria fueled several of season five's stories.|$|E

25|$|A {{singular}} enchantment {{was employed}} to kill off a husband of a pretty woman desired by someone else. The expanded flower of a Gardenia was stuck upright—a very difficult performance—in a cup (i.e., half a large coconut shell) of water. A prayer was then offered for the husbands speedy death, the sorcerer earnestly watching the flower. Should <b>it</b> <b>fall</b> the incantation was successful. But if the flower still remained upright, he will live. The sorcerer would in that case try his skill another day, with perhaps better success.|$|E
25|$|The Daria TV movies Is <b>It</b> <b>Fall</b> Yet? and Is It College Yet? {{were the}} sole two {{authorized}} DVD releases until 2010. Each DVD also includes two episodes from the series, from seasons 4 and 5 respectively, with licensed music removed. The latter disc uses a second-showing MTV version that was shortened by approximately seven minutes, {{rather than the}} original cablecast version. It does, however, include a short clip of a Daria appearance on Beavis and Butt-Head, accessed as a hidden Easter egg on the opening menu (by cycling among menu choices until the highlighting disappears).|$|E

On the journey back home from the Ganges, they carry small quantities of river water with them for use in rituals (Ganga jal, literally water of the Ganges).|$|E

25|$|The cell {{provided}} 1.9 volts. It proved {{popular with}} experimenters {{for many years}} due to its relatively high voltage; greater ability to produce a consistent current and lack of any fumes, but the relative fragility of its thin glass enclosure {{and the necessity of}} having to raise the zinc plate when the cell was not in use eventually saw <b>it</b> <b>fall</b> out of favour. The cell was also known as the 'chromic acid cell', but principally as the 'bichromate cell'. This latter name came from the practice of producing the chromic acid by adding sulphuric acid to potassium dichromate, even though the cell itself contained no dichromate.|$|E
25|$|René and Mélusine, now lovers, are in {{a richly}} {{decorated}} pavilion in the château Lusignan. They are surrounded by fairies, ondines, nymphs, gnomes and other mythical creatures who dance and sing for their entertainment. Suddenly the castle walls part and Stello de Nici appears. René demands to {{know who he is}} and Stello tells him that he is Mélusine's lover. René draws his sword, but Stello's powers make <b>it</b> <b>fall</b> apart in his hands. Stello then reveals Mélusine's trickery to René and tells him about her diabolic nature and pagan practices. René is overcome with remorse and vows to seek Blanche's forgiveness. He curses Mélusine as do a large chorus of demons whom Stello has summoned. As daylight breaks, Mélusine's face takes on a horrible expression and she is bathed in a lurid green light.|$|E
25|$|The club {{finished}} October hosting rock-bottom Cesena at home, {{but it was}} Parma themselves who now had {{the worst}} defensive record in the league. Parma had the better of the first half, particularly in the opening stages, and they won a penalty after Giovinco was felled by Alejandro Rodríguez, although {{it was unclear whether}} the Parma player was in or outside the box when the foul was made. The argument was ultimately academic because Giovinco's centrally-placed penalty was saved by Francesco Antonioli in the Cesena goal. Six minutes later and just before half-time, Gabriel Paletta scored his first Serie A goal after some footballing pinball saw <b>it</b> <b>fall</b> to the Argentine, who slotted it home from close range. More chances for the hosts followed in the second period and Alessandro Lucarelli made the game safe after a Cristian Zaccardo flick-on found him free at the back post. This was Parma's first clean sheet of the season, finally managing the feat at the tenth attempt.|$|E
