The research is done <b>in</b> <b>test</b> room. Non-value-added motion or activity can reduce productivity and slowing production pro-cess. Improvement proposal of this research consist of re-layout proposal of test room and im-plementation of kaizen <b>in</b> <b>test</b> room.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to analyze compliance, knowledge of and satisfaction with the SSC to determine further improvements. Methods The implementation of the SSC was observed in a pilot unit. After roll-out into each operat-ing theater, compliance with the SSC was routinely measured. To assess subjective and objective knowledge, as well as satisfaction with the SSC implementation, an online survey (N = 891) was performed. Results During two <b>test</b> runs <b>in</b> a piloting unit, 305 operations were observed, 175 <b>in</b> <b>test</b> run 1 and 130 <b>in</b> <b>test</b> run 2.

5|$|As it {{was easier}} to raise money for medical purposes, {{particularly}} cancer treatment, than for nuclear physics, Lawrence encouraged the use of the cyclotron for medical research. Working with his brother John and Israel Lyon Chaikoff from the University of California's Physiology Department, Lawrence supported research into the use of radioactive isotopes for therapeutic purposes. Phosphorus-32 was easily produced in the cyclotron, and John used it to cure a woman afflicted with polycythemia vera, a blood disease. John used phosphorus-32 created in the 37-inch cyclotron in 1938 <b>in</b> <b>tests</b> on mice with leukemia. He found that the radioactive phosphorus concentrated in the fast-growing cancer cells. This then led to clinical trials on human patients. A 1948 evaluation of the therapy showed that remissions occurred under certain circumstances. Lawrence also had hoped for the medical use of neutrons. The first cancer patient received neutron therapy from the 60-inch cyclotron on November 20. Chaikoff conducted trials on the use of radioactive isotopes as radioactive tracers to explore the mechanism of biochemical reactions.|$|E

As said before, the ratio of sludge to water and the overall concentration of continuous phase (the sludge) are important factors in viscosity. Therefore, as seen, because of higher overall content of the sludge, despite high emulsifier concentration <b>in</b> <b>test</b> no. 3, the final emulsion is sticky and viscous so the viscosity cannot be measured. Additionally, <b>in</b> <b>test</b> nos. 3 and 6, the sludge to water ratio is 50 / 40 and 50 / 49.2, respectively. So, the viscosity of test no. 6 should be lower than test no. 3. On the other hand, <b>in</b> <b>test</b> nos. 6 and 7, as emulsifier content increases and water content decreases, the viscosity increases a little from 260.5 to 263  cp because of a little high overall sludge content <b>in</b> <b>test</b> no. 7.|$|R
