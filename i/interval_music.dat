500|$|Early {{before the}} release of B'Day in 2006, Knowles held a {{nationwide}} audition for female musicians which ended in Sony Music Studios {{where she and her}} father and collaborator Mathew Knowles were among the judges. The auditions searched for keyboard players, bassists, guitarists, horn players, percussionists and drummers with stops in New Jersey, Atlanta, Burbank, Chicago and Houston. The musicians were asked to re-create the performance of [...] "Work It Out" [...] from the live album Live at Wembley (2004) and be able to perform at least a one-minute solo. Knowles stated that her goal was to get together a group of [...] "fierce, talented, hungry, beautiful" [...] women and form an all-female band. Speaking about her tour and the decision to form a band, Knowles said, [...] "I'm all about female empowerment. I'm all about pushing the envelope. I know it's my responsibility to do something different. I said, 'I want a band, I want something different.'" [...] She further described the process of choosing the contestants during an interview, saying: [...] "I had worldwide auditions; people flew in from Atlanta, Houston, Israel, all over the world. It was extremely difficult [...] [...] so many talented women. I wanted only a nine-piece band, but the girls were so amazing, I couldn't decide. I think I'm going to wind up having 12 people so I have two [...] certain instruments, because [...] were just brilliant. It's a thing called star quality, it's a thing you can't put your finger on, can't describe. When they were playing, I said, 'I want to see y'all battle.' I brought in two of every instrument and that's how I chose. You see the one that really wants it. It was so entertaining, the energy, seeing the girls battle ... God, it was the best. It was magical." [...] Between segments of the show, Suga Mama performed periodic instrumental interludes, with every member giving a solo so Knowles could change her costumes seven times. Describing them as [...] "fantastic", Eamon Sweeney of the Irish Independent noted that [...] "the <b>interval</b> <b>music</b> works perfectly... but two excruciating drum solos are absolutely unnecessary".|$|E

50|$|The musical part varies {{greatly in}} length, the plays with most music being Agua, azucarillos y aguardiente and La verbena de la paloma. Normally, the plays are {{preceded by a}} musical prelude, and {{occasionally}} have little <b>intervals</b> or <b>music</b> for dancing, and finish with a short finale in which the music from some previous scene is repeated. There are usually passages read over background music, in Singspiel style.|$|R
5000|$|The outer helix {{represents}} pitches classes. Neighboring pitch {{classes are}} a <b>music</b> <b>interval</b> {{of a perfect}} fifth, and spatially a quarter rotation, apart. The order of the pitch classes can {{be determined by the}} line of fifths. For example, C would be followed by G (C and G are a perfect fifth apart), which would be followed D (G and D are a perfect fifth apart), etc. As a result of this structure, and one of the important properties leading to its selection, vertical neighbors are a <b>music</b> <b>interval</b> of a major third apart. Thus, a pitch class's nearest neighbors and itself form perfect fifth and major third intervals.|$|R
50|$|Interval {{recognition}} {{is also a}} useful skill for musicians: {{in order to determine}} the notes in a melody, a musician must have some ability to recognize <b>intervals.</b> Some <b>music</b> teachers teach their students relative pitch by having them associate each possible interval with the first two notes of a popular song.

25|$|Around 1500, Mouton {{seems to}} have {{become more aware of}} chords and {{harmonic}} feeling, probably due to his encounter with Italian music.

5000|$|Musically, the {{structure}} of [...] "The Trial" [...] is similar to an earlier track on the album, [...] "Run Like Hell," [...] with the same chord sequence of E minor, F, back to E minor, C, and B. However, there are various {{differences between the two}} songs, such as vastly different instrumentation. The bass alternates between the root (E) and fifth (B) of the E minor chord, and when the chord changes to F Major, the bass remains the same, resulting in a strong feeling of tension and dissonance, as the relationship between the F chord and the B note is a tritone, the most unstable <b>interval</b> in <b>music.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} {{the question of what}} type of instructional strategy most effectively facilitates the learning of <b>music</b> <b>intervals</b> for beginning <b>music</b> majors. The three types of instructional strategy were programmed instruction {{in the form of a}} linear programmed text, mastery learning using computer-assisted instruction (CAI), and self-practice using a textbook-study approach. This study also explored the variable of information retention overtime. The delayed-retention test was given 48 hours after the test of immediate retention. Results on the dependent measure of retention indicated that mastery learning-CAl was a significantly better instructional strategy for learning <b>music</b> <b>intervals</b> than programmed instruction or self-practice. The results indicated a significantly higher performance score for mastery learning-CAl and programmed in-struction over self-practice. The self-practice condition was left at a disadvantage in this regard because the learner had to decide what was relevant and what must be learned from what should be ignored. The attitude measure result indicated that learners prefer instructional information to be well organized. The learner's cognitive or mental manipulations on to-be-learned in-formation forms a major determinant in the potential effectiveness of his or her processing of information (Dansereau, Actkinson, Long, & McDonald, Note 1). The effective cognitive organization of newly en-countered information is the basis for successful information processing. Effective cognitive organization means that the learner has gone beyond mere rote learning of data and has successfully assimilated new informa-tion into his or her existing knowledge structure. The effective information processing of to-be-learned information can be significantly facilitated when the learner uses a learning strategy that aids his or her cognitive organization of to-be-acquired information (Hil-gard & Bower, 1975). It has now been shown that learners can be taught information processing strategies that facilitate their cognitive organiza-tion of academic material and thus improve learning (Bower, 1973).

50|$|In Western <b>music,</b> <b>intervals</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} differences between notes of a diatonic scale. The smallest of these intervals is a semitone. Intervals {{smaller than a}} semitone are called microtones. They can be formed using the notes of various kinds of non-diatonic scales. Some of the very smallest ones are called commas, and describe small discrepancies, observed in some tuning systems, between enharmonically equivalent notes such as C and D. Intervals can be arbitrarily small, and even imperceptible to the human ear.|$|R
5000|$|Earlier sources mention Pythagoras' {{interest}} in harmony and ratio. Xenocrates (4th century BCE), while {{not as far}} as we know mentioning the blacksmith story, described Pythagoras' {{interest in}} general terms: [...] "Pythagoras discovered also that the <b>intervals</b> in <b>music</b> do not come into being apart from number; for they are an interrelation of quantity with quantity. So he set out to investigate under what conditions concordant intervals come about, and discordant ones, and everything well-attuned and ill-tuned." [...] Whatever the details of the discovery of the relationship between music and ratio, it is regarded [...] as historically the first empirically secure mathematical description of a physical fact. As such, it is symbolic of, and perhaps leads to, the Pythagorean conception of mathematics as nature's modus operandi. [...] As Aristotle was later to write, [...] "the Pythagoreans construct the whole universe out of numbers".|$|R
50|$|Having not {{completed}} primary studies, he was {{ignorant of the}} acoustic basis of music - so he was fascinated when Ortega discussed laws governing generation of fundamental <b>intervals</b> in <b>music.</b> For example, when a violin string is depressed (stopped) at its midpoint, it produces a pitch twice the frequency of (an octave above) the open string. When a string is stopped at one-third, the remaining two-thirds vibrates a perfect fifth higher than the open string (almost exactly equivalent to 5/8 of an octave). Carrillo explored these relationships in experiments. For a while he tried, but couldn't divide the string further than into eight equal parts. Then he left the traditional way of dividing the string into two, three, four, five, six, seven and eight equal parts, and, using a razor to stop the string, divided the fourth string of his violin between G and A into sixteen parts. He could produce sixteen clearly different sounds within a whole tone.|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{history and}} across cultures, humans have created <b>music</b> using pitch <b>intervals</b> that divide octaves into the 12 {{tones of the}} {{chromatic}} scale. Why these specific <b>intervals</b> in <b>music</b> are preferred, however, is not known. In the present study, we analyzed a database of individually spoken English vowel phones to examine the hypothesis that musical intervals arise from the relationships of the formants in speech spectra that determine the perceptions of distinct vowels. Expressed as ratios, the frequency relationships {{of the first two}} formants in vowel phones represent all 12 intervals of the chromatic scale. Were the formants to fall outside the ranges found in the human voice, their relationships would generate either a less complete or a more dilute representation of these specific intervals. These results imply that human preference for the intervals of the chromatic scale arises from experience with the way speech formants modulate laryngeal harmonics to create different phonemes...|$|R
