Moreover, it {{provides an overview of}} the current state of research on how <b>freight</b> <b>villages</b> contribute to an enhancement of supply chain performance. Databank research was conducted to review internationally published literature and existing research was evaluated based on relevant international contributions. Furthermore, a questionnaire was constructed to carry out an explorative study of <b>freight</b> <b>villages</b> in Germany. The functional performance of the investigated <b>freight</b> <b>villages</b> showed that there is a strong need to attach greater importance to the fulfilment of functions targeting on the streamlining of logistical processes within supply chains and the integration of value-adding services at supply chain interfaces. Results from this study provide insight into the potential performance of <b>freight</b> <b>villages</b> as supply chain interfaces. Therefore it is necessary to put intelligent multimodal transport chains into practice and to provide powerful logistical and value-adding services to achieve greater flexibility of adjustment to changing demand and a higher delivery service level.

40|$|Background: The {{development}} of international freight corridors, as the Trans European Network and new rail and inland shipping corridors in Asia and Africa, require efficient logistics centres along these corridors which serve as intermodal interfaces {{and provide a}} variety of different logistics service functions. The definition of the term logistics centre differs between countries and implies different functionalities. Locations are often selected randomly and business models are opportunity driven, especially in highly dynamic and less regulated new emerging economies. In particular <b>Freight</b> <b>Villages</b> as a special form of logistics centres have a high impact on regional development and serve as cargo generator for freight corridors. Consideration of general principles how to establish <b>Freight</b> <b>Villages</b> could improve the effectiveness of these logistics centres along freight corridors. 	Methods: Based on a literature review a comprehensive and hierarchical definition of logistics centres will be discussed and applied. From experiences in the {{development of}} logistics centres in several countries, especially in Germany and Lithuania, challenges and concepts concerning regulatory framework, determination of location and business and financing models are discussed. 	Results: Concerning the definition of logistics centres a hierarchical definition is applied which comprises different levels of logistics centres depending on the scope of the value adding and the functionality. As general principles for the development of <b>Freight</b> <b>Villages</b> the active role of the state, master planning, objective location finding, participation and co-operation of different stakeholders in the business model and a stepwise scheme for financing are introduced. Major trends for the future development of <b>Freight</b> <b>Villages</b> are the digitalization of supply chains, the application of new intermodal technologies and of innovative telematics systems, solutions for low emission and electro mobility, especially in connection with city logistics, and the collaboration of <b>Freight</b> <b>Villages...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} and analyses appraisal methods {{used for the}} assessment of potential investments in Nodal Centers for Goods (also called <b>Freight</b> <b>Villages),</b> which constitute an essential element of the Trans-European Network for Intermodal Transport. A methodological procedure is applied to identify the underlying factors that influence the choice of an appraisal method, without assessing or comparing the appraisal methods themselves. Following this procedure, issues addressed by the methods are grouped into three broad dimensions and with the use of non-parametric statistical tests, existing relationships are identified between nodal centres' characteristics, the appraisal methods, as well as the actors involved in the decision process. On applying the above procedure to European Nodal Centres for goods, it is found that the choice of appraisal method and the decision criteria for the investment are linked primarily to the nodal centre's size, catchment area, and the support or absence of political approval for the investment. The results of the analysis can be particularly useful at the policy making level, serving as non-formal "qualitative guidelines" to identify the appraisal method to be applied, as well as the options and impacts to be considered.

30|$|The {{maritime}} shipping industry has, for many years, applied the ‘hub-and-spoke’ or ‘nodes-and-links’ concept, integrating multiple actors in one transport chain to achieve cost- and time-effective services. The concept {{is still at}} an early stage of development and application in the rail freight sector. The nodes-and-links concept encompasses various types of terminals, connecting each other as well as cargo origins and destinations, such as hubs, marshalling yards, <b>freight</b> <b>villages,</b> sea ports, dry ports, intermodal, conventional and multimodal terminals, and industrial and logistics zones [16, 38]. The nodes have to be close to a production and/or large consumption area and at corridor crossing points [21]. They have to: transform the traditional transit function over normal working hours into value‐added, round the clock transit, by quick transfer between modes and/or train to train; achieve a high fill coefficient of trains or last mile transport; have a high degree of reliability for the end customer; and the ability to find the best connection to reach the end terminal through integration into the whole network [1, 15]. These represent the key elements that contribute to managing transport networks efficiently.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a method and models {{for assessing the}} financial viability of a new <b>Freight</b> <b>village</b> financed by private and public investments. The financial evaluation model constitutes an integrated part of a wider planning methodology, with four distinct phases, namely (a) site selection and traffic forecasts, (b) definition of services offered and corresponding dimensions, (c) estimation of investment and operation costs and (d) evaluation of investments. The paper presents the overall methodology, and {{presents a}}nalytically the evaluation method with the corresponding model. The model is developed specifically for the financial evaluation of investments for a <b>Freight</b> <b>village</b> incorporating uncertainty considerations in {{the values of the}} variables considered. The financial evaluation method identifies the various transport and other variables, which determine the cash flow of inputs (revenues) and outputs (investments, expenses) related to the construction and operation of a <b>Freight</b> <b>village.</b> Furthermore, the model produces financing scenarios, based on combinations of public and private funds as well as bank loans. In addition using Monte Carlo simulation the expected values of some key variables (investment costs, forecasted volumes and revenues) are estimated.

These elements will be further reinforced in the future with the accession of two Balkan states in the E. U., namely Bulgaria and Romania, and with the anticipated regularization of trade processes. This new environment undoubtedly favors the development of complex and well-designed trade infrastructures, such as Freight Villages, {{that are expected to}} have a strong influence on regional development and on the reduction of product distribution costs. The case of the <b>Freight</b> <b>Village</b> on the Greek – Bulgarian border at Promachonas in Serres is an interesting and original case study for the greater area. The first <b>Freight</b> <b>Village</b> in Greece, with the contribution of the private, public and EU capital has already been in operation since 2001, contributing to the rationalized management of trade flows, the development of cross-border trade, the provision of high quality services to consumers, the increase in employment and to the regional development of the degraded border area of Serres.

40|$|In general manner; Turkey and Germany {{are quite}} unlike {{countries}} {{in terms of}} transportation infrastructure and logitics facilities. Many reasons, most of them ground historical reasons, could be regarded such as; geographical location, industrial history, economic. For whatever reason might be; in today?s context the world witness the highest logistics performans index score in Germany and an aggressively developing country in Turkey. As Europe's largest economy and second most populous nation, Germany leads in developing logistics strategies and services as a key member of the continent's economic and political structure. On the other hand, Turkey has got a real strategic location between the continents but traditionally has problems with transportation mode distribution and interconnectivity of systems that prevent Turkey to undertake the 'hub' role for its region and achieve economic benefit. The efficient mobility of people and freight {{is a prerequisite for}} modern economic success. Due to increasing globalization, transportation of freight and logistics play an ever important role in a country's ability to compete in the global market. Global supply chains require a large number of high-performing physical interfaces, such as container terminals, seaports and/or <b>freight</b> <b>villages,</b> to establish a perfect material flow along the entire world. From this point of view; Germany is chosen as the best perfomed country all over the world. Likewise, Turkey needs a kind of a 'benchmarking' in order to overcome transportation and logistics infrastructural and strategic problems. The aim {{of this paper is to}} focus on the successful strategic location desicion of <b>freight</b> <b>villages</b> and transportation mode distribution of Germany. In accordance with this purpose, first section of this paper is substantially based on secondary data gathered from a wide variety of sources including Turkish/German Statistical Institutes, Ministries of Transportation, Maritime Affairs and Communication and NGO's of the sector besides European Commision Statistical Office (eurostat) and academic studies. Data gathered is used to point the current transport indicators of Turkey with respect to Germany.

This research extends sustainability {{in the context}} of FVs to twofold meanings. This includes the sustainable development of FVs, and the sustainability contributions they created. China has showed a more recent but quicker story in developing FVs. Nevertheless, a number of problems and limits exist. Taking China as research background, this research consists of theoretical explorations, status quo analysis, and practical applications in agricultural products logistics (APL). This research proposes that knowledge management (KM) is the most desirable option to reach sustainable values of FVs. The status quo analysis examines the adaption of FVs to China s current logistics situation. It identifies several orientations for the next development step of FVs. To cope with the pervasive problems during FV planning stage, this research adopts sense-making KM approach to guide a systematic planning process including sense making, knowledge creation, and decision making. In order to achieve a high sustainability rating, this research uses KM cycle model to generate synergies among major stakeholders of FVs. Moreover, it proposes a roadmap for organizing KM process so as to build sustainability capability. Three key elements for the roadmap are identified: human ability, stakeholder engagement, and information system. This research focuses on the application of sustainable FV concepts for agricultural products logistics (APL). It deals with issues affecting city logistics and agricultural products (agri-products) supply in China. This can make best use of FV functions from a sustainability perspective.
