5|$|Tatwine was a Mercian by birth. His <b>epigraph</b> at Canterbury {{stated that}} when he died he was in old age, so perhaps he was born around 670. He became a monk at the monastery at Breedon-on-the-Hill in the present-day County of Leicestershire, and then abbot of that house. Through the {{influence}} of King Æthelbald he was appointed as Archbishop of Canterbury in 731 and was consecrated on 10 June 731. He {{was one of a}} number of Mercians who were appointed to Canterbury during the 730s and 740s. Apart from his consecration of the Bishops of Lindsey and Selsey in 733, Tatwine's period as archbishop appears to have been uneventful. He died in office on 30 July 734. Later considered a saint, his feast day is 30 July.|$|E

They feature voice acting by the cast from the Steins;Gate game, and music and cover art by the game's composer Takeshi Abo and character designer Huke, respectively. The dramas were well received by critics and popular with fans, leading {{to the creation of}} manga and light novel adaptations. They were also used as the base for the <b>Epigraph</b> Trilogy of light novels and the Steins;Gate 0 video game. The trilogy was recorded in Japanese, but the third drama has gotten an English fan translation.|$|E

5|$|The Great Seal: The Great Seal of Fordham University was {{designed}} to acknowledge {{the presence of the}} Society of Jesus on campus, hence the order's coat of arms in the seal's center. The coat of arms bears the Greek letters of the lapidary form of Jesus Christ (IHS), with the Cross resting on the center of the H and the three nails of the Crucifixion beneath the <b>epigraph.</b> These figures, dressed in gold, lay in a field framed in maroon, the color of the university, with silver fleur-de-lis at the edge. The fleur-de-lis symbolize the French Jesuits who arrived at Fordham in 1846. Immediately above the central shield rests the laurel crown, enclosing the university's pedagogical disciplines: arts, science, philosophy, medicine, and law. Below the shield is a blue scroll with the university's motto, Sapientia et Doctrina. The scroll rests on a gold field emblematic of learning (doctrina) and is surrounded by the fiery tongues of the Holy Spirit, a symbol of wisdom (sapientia). In a circular maroon field embroidered with beads is Fordham's official title, Universitas Fordhamensis; at the field's lower edge is the date of the university's founding, 1841. Finally, surrounding the entire seal is a heraldic belt, which is employed as a stylistic decoration. The University of Oxford, the only other tertiary institution in the world that uses a belt in its seal, however, maintains that without the belt, the seal is not official.|$|E
5|$|The Western Gangas used Kannada and Sanskrit {{extensively}} {{as their}} language of administration. Some of their inscriptions are also bilingual in these languages. In bilingual inscriptions the formulaic passages stating origin myths, genealogies, titles of Kings and benedictions {{tended to be}} in Sanskrit, while the actual terms of the grant such as information on the land or village granted, its boundaries, participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues and other local concerns were in the local language. The usage of these two languages showed important changes over the centuries. During the first phase (350–725), Sanskrit copper plates dominated, indicating the initial ascendancy of the local language as a language of administration {{and the fact that}} majority of the records from this phase were brahmadeya grants (grants to Brahmin temples). In the second phase (725–1000), lithic inscriptions in Kannada outnumbered Sanskrit copper plates, consistent with the patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains who used Kannada as their medium to spread the Jain faith. Recent excavations at Tumbula near Mysore have revealed a set of early copper plate bilingual inscriptions dated 444. The genealogy of the kings of the dynasty is described in Sanskrit while Kannada was used to describe the boundary of the village. An interesting inscription discovered at Beguru near modern Bangalore that deserves mention is the <b>epigraph</b> dated 890 that refers to a Bengaluru war. This is in Hale Kannada (old Kannada) language and is the earliest mention of the name of Bangalore city. The Western Gangas minted coins with Kannada and Nagari legends, the most common feature on their coins was the image of an elephant on the obverse and floral petal symbols on the reverse. The Kannada legend Bhadr, a royal umbrella or a conch shell appeared on top of the elephant image. The denominations are the pagoda (weighing 52 grains), the fanam weighting one tenth or one half of the pagoda and the quarter fanams.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the failure}} of using {{adequately}} the thesaurus «Descriptores en Ciencias de la Salud (DeCS) » in the assignment of <b>epigraphs</b> during the cataloging process, a number of technical instructions are drawn. These instructions enable the librarians from the National System of Medical Sciences Information {{to use it as a}} dictionary of <b>epigraphs</b> because most of them do not have automatic systems for the processing of information so that they support themselves in the search and recovery procedures on the cataloging index card. The subject representation of documents through <b>epigraphs</b> and its basic principles are discussed as well as the rules for the coordination of <b>epigraphs</b> and subepigraphs and the restrictions in using some of the types of subheadings. The implementation of the annex Práctica catalográfica en el DeCS, based upon the Cataloging Practices of MeSH is recommended as a strategy to eliminate the contradictions generated by the lack of appropiate dispositions to represent all the aspects discussed in the documents and submitted to the assignment of <b>epigraphs</b> and subepigraphs...|$|R

25|$|In context, the <b>epigraph</b> {{refers to}} a meeting between Dante and Guido da Montefeltro, who was {{condemned}} to the eighth circle of Hell for providing counsel to Pope Boniface VIII, who wished to use Guido's advice for a nefarious undertaking. This encounter follows Dante's meeting with Ulysses, who himself is also condemned to the circle of the Fraudulent. According to Ron Banerjee, the <b>epigraph</b> serves to cast ironic light on Prufrock's intent. Like Guido, Prufrock had never intended his story to be told, and so by quoting Guido, Eliot reveals his view of Prufrock's love song.|$|E

25|$|Another stylistic choice {{she makes}} is {{frequently}} beginning with an <b>epigraph</b> from the written {{records of the}} long assault on Native Peoples. Often she uses this <b>epigraph</b> from the historical, archeological world, as a jumping off point for her poetry which is narrated by a Native-identified voice, allowing for the reader to draw {{the connection between the}} two. This juxtaposition brings the “historical artifact” of bone or cloth to life and we can see the skin being literally ripped away with the language of the poetry and giving the casual observer a real vision of that object.|$|E

25|$|The Chatalar Inscription, a Bulgarian <b>epigraph</b> {{written on}} a column in medieval Greek, was {{unearthed}} in 1905 {{in the village of}} Han Krum (then known as Chatalar). The inscription's text indicates that kanasybigi Omurtag built an aulē with four columns topped by two lion sculptures near the Ticha River. Earlier scholars linked that passage with Preslav, the city that would succeed Omurtag's capital Pliska as the ruling centre of the Bulgarian Empire in the end of the 9th century. In modern times, however, Omurtag's aulē has been conclusively proven to be the site at Han Krum, which is much closer to where the <b>epigraph</b> was excavated. While it remains unclear whether the word aulē should be interpreted as the Greek αύλή ("palace, court") or the steppe nomadic aul, a fortified ruling centre, the ruins at Han Krum suitably match the medieval description.|$|E
