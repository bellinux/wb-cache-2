500|$|Over {{the course}} of Glee second season, Lauren forms a {{relationship}} with local bad boy and football star Noah Puckerman. As the season progresses, Lauren and Puck's relationship continues to grow stronger. Their relationship begins to form in the ninth episode of the second season titled [...] "Special Education". After Puck attempts to recruit new members for the William McKinley High School glee club, members of the football team lock him in a port-a-potty. After being discovered by Lauren, he convinces her to join New Directions, despite her belief that show choir is stupid. Ashley Fink said of their relationship: [...] "I think Ryan Murphy has a master plan and we're all kind of along for the ride. I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> but I wouldn't count us out just yet on that front. We all have to laugh at ourselves but it's going somewhere. Ultimately, {{it comes down to}} whether audiences will buy a relationship between Puck and Lauren. I think there's a really hilarious chemistry between Puck and Lauren. I think he's a badass, she's a badass. I don't know, I think they're funny together. There's something about {{the two of them together}} that I like, so I hope it's not outside the realm of possibility." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 24 November, Hannam, Hewett and {{the head}} of Eastbourne CID, Detective Inspector Pugh, searched Adams' house with a warrant issued (in Pugh's name) under the Dangerous Drugs Act 1951. When told they were looking for, [...] "Morphine, Heroin, Pethidine and the like", Adams was surprised: [...] "Oh, that group. You will find none here. I haven't any. I very seldom ever use them", he said. When Hannam asked for Adams' Dangerous Drugs Register – the record of those ordered and used – Adams responded: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> I keep no register." [...] He had not kept one since 1949. When shown a list of {{dangerous}} drugs he had prescribed Morrell, and asked who administered them, Adams said, [...] "I did nearly all. Perhaps the nurses gave some but mostly me" [...] – contradicting what the nurses' notebooks would show during his trial. Hannam then observed, [...] "Doctor, you prescribed for her 75 – 1/6 grains heroin tablets the day before she died." [...] Adams replied, [...] "Poor soul, she was in terrible agony. It was all used. I used them myself [...] Do you think it is too much?" ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{looked at}} her askance, but smiled and said: [...] "I should {{understand}} your information--for which I'm so much obliged--a little better if I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by an impediment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{knows it}} already;--that is, she <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> I have not {{told her of}} the woman's lie, nor of this demand for money. But I shall when she {{is strong enough to}} hear it and to talk of it. You are very much mistaken if you think that there are secrets between me and Hester.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{had all the}} {{advantages}} and comforts of other slaves; I <b>know</b> not <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by `tried,'" [...] retorted Omar, with a grim smile.|$|R
60|$|PROF. [Helplessly] My dear, I really don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b>|$|E
60|$|MATEY (with growing uneasiness). I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> ladies.|$|E
60|$|MORELL (quite at a loss). Yes. No. I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Shaken! Yes, in {{one sense}} I have been shaken. I don't <b>know</b> quite <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> I shall never be shaken in the other way." ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{discussing}} Bullshit! on {{his radio}} show, Penn either broke the word in half, usually with a clap and a slight pause (BullsHit), or change it to Bullshot. He frequently referred to how Criss Angel's show Mind Freak had [...] "the perfect title, everyone <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> and <b>you</b> can advertise", which they could not. On an episode of the public radio program Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!, Penn referred to the show as Bushlit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor can I--except the one. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>know</b> {{yourself}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to {{do about}} your cousin. Everybody <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> ought to do after the disgraceful {{things that have been}} put into all the newspapers." ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. [Embarrassed.] I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> [Changing the {{conversation}} abruptly.] Daisy, now that I'm going away....|$|E
60|$|I'm awfully stupid, {{but if he}} was innocent, {{how could}} they find him guilty? I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b>|$|E
60|$|ELLIE. Why do {{you look}} so enigmatic about it? You are such a sphinx: I never <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Peter, {{how dare}} you add {{falsehood}} to--to--you <b>know</b> <b>what.</b> Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> {{to say that my}} father told you to kiss me, and at six o'clock in the morning, too?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My wraith!" [...] said Dunois; [...] "I <b>know</b> not <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> But yonder is a caitiff with my {{bearings}} {{displayed on}} crest and shield, whom I will presently punish for his insolence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I guess she'd {{live through}} it," [...] said the {{mother with a}} laugh. She added, [...] "I don't know as I <b>know</b> just <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by the Synthesis of Art Studies." ...|$|R
60|$|I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by that. But I flatter myself I know a good cigar when I see it.|$|E
6000|$|Isabel {{gazed at}} her cousin again. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> You mean something--that you don't mean. What was Monsieur Merle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Parker was not abashed. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> Those are all {{expressions}} {{my father}} used. They stick {{to me like}} fly-paper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bear with him! I do not <b>know</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> Of course I will {{remember}} {{that he is an}} old man, and not answer him as I would one of my own age." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{other man}} {{fiercely}} turned. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean--you <b>mean</b> {{the woman is}} not to be condemned--that love goes where it is drawn. That is true, but deceit is not involuntary--it is deliberate--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; that's terrible," [...] sighed Mrs. Pasmer, {{with the}} abstractly severe yet {{personally}} pitying perception of one whose every word and act was sincere and direct. [...] "I <b>know</b> just <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> But {{how does it}} apply to Mr. Mavering?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, but--" [...] Ruth stammered. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> then. You admire their voices, yet {{say they}} spoiled the music." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] {{said the}} Man in Asbestos impatiently, [...] "please don't get excited. I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> It was quite irrational." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> Dr. Grantly; I don't {{know what}} you're talking about. I don't {{want to break}} away from anybody." ...|$|E
60|$|That, apparently, was {{the best}} that Giovio could think of. It is hardly intelligible--which is perhaps inevitable, for {{it is not easy}} to be intelligible when you don't quite <b>know,</b> yourself, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> which must have been Giovio's case.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oswald was not there. That I <b>know</b> is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to ask. Papa {{said that}} he might come if he pleased. Oswald stipulated {{that he should be}} {{received}} as a son. Then my father spoke the hardest word that ever fell from his mouth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Tell him so! I <b>know</b> that’s <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> I <b>know</b> {{every word}} goes to him that’s dropped from every general officer’s mouth. I don’t say he’s not brave. Curse him! he’s brave enough; but we’ll {{wait for the}} Gazette, gentlemen. God save her Majesty! she’ll do us justice.” ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{pulled her}} up for a moment. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> He doesn't make speeches and professions at all--he isn't ridiculous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> sir,' said Siegmund, very quietly, with {{a strong}} fear and a fascination {{opposing}} each other in his heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not that. When you ask me--to--to--love you, {{of course}} I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> Should I not {{speak the truth}} at once?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> {{about your}} father: {{he is no}} martinet in society, even with his son. He assumes to himself no mysterious unintelligible dignity. He has none of the {{military}} Grimgruffenuff about him. He takes things easily, and allows other people to do the same." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell him so! I <b>know</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> I <b>know</b> {{every word}} goes to him that's dropped from every general officer's mouth.

6000|$|Nay, {{also what}} {{it stands for}} as an attribute, not only of men, but of gods; nor of those only as merciful, but also as avenging. Against Æneas himself, Dido invokes the waves of the Tyrrhene Sea, [...] "si quid pia numina possunt." [...] Be assured there is no getting at the matter by {{dictionary}} or context. To <b>know</b> <b>what</b> love <b>means,</b> <b>you</b> must love; to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> piety <b>means,</b> <b>you</b> must be pious.|$|R
