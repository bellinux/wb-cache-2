40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} in-service teacher's perceptions regarding their practices related to the integration of the nature of science (NOS) in their science courses. In this case study more than one sampling method was used. Firstly, purposive sampling method was used to determine the teachers who had taken courses regarding the nature of science in their undergraduate education. Then two teachers were selected using the criterion sampling method. These teachers were selected according to their school type, and the location where they work. Both teachers work in public schools however, one of these schools was in the capital city of the country, the other was in poor village. A constant comparative method was used for the data analysis. In this study, the researcher first collected the data and then carried out the analysis based upon the data revealed by transcriptions of interviews. Different evaluators were used for triangulation. For the validity of the interview questions, the opinions of one qualitative research expert and one science educator were obtained. In addition, raw data in the form of <b>direct</b> <b>quotations</b> <b>were</b> given to the readers without any interpretations. To ensure reliability, the codes were discussed with a qualitative research expert and science educator.

40|$|AbstractLearning is a {{progress}} {{beginning with}} birth, and continuing for a lifetime. Primary {{education is the}} most important step where basic knowledge and skills are gained. Sound foundations in this stage will {{play an important role in}} one's lifetime achievements. In our age, where everything changes and develops with great speed, individuals; who can adapt to this speed, think, question, criticize, create solutions, always look forward, create multiple points of view, express his/her emotions independently, use his/her language effectively; are needed. There are two dimensions of language; understanding and expression. Speaking and writing is the dimension of expression; listening and reading is the dimension of understanding. Writing is an activity which develops later than reading. For the healthy development of writing skill in the manner our age requires, a versatile support is needed. Curriculum, teacher, family, books, especially the textbooks used in mother tongue lessons have important responsibilities in order to have the student express his/her emotions, thoughts, dreams independently. The reason is that books play an important role in the development of both oral and written expression skills. Are books being prepared in a way to fulfill this important responsibility they undertake?In this descriptive research, the sections and instructions of texts on written expression, included in Turkish Language textbooks (6 - 8) studied in school in Turkey during 2009 - 2010 education year.

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the demands, pressures and needs experienced by teachers in special needs schools (referred to as schools with learners with barriers to learning), with the aim of providing guidelines for teacher support to promote wellness. To attain this aim, the study had the following specific objectives or aims: 1. To determine the demands made on and pressures experienced by teachers as stressors. 2. To determine the needs which teachers experience to alleviate these stressors that arise as a result of the demands and pressures experienced by teachers in a special needs school. 3. The provision of guidelines for teacher support in order to promote wellness. 4. To make recommendations for the promotion of the wellness of teachers in a special needs school. A qualitative research design was considered to be the most appropriate for gaining in-depth insight into the demands, pressures and needs of these teachers. Data was collected through phenomenological interviews and direct observations. This data was then organised into categories and subcategories and <b>direct</b> <b>quotations</b> <b>were</b> presented verbatim.

40|$|Premature births, {{which are}} among the leading causes of {{neonatal}} mortality and morbidity in South Africa, often result not only in adverse effects on the infant due to the poorly developed organs and systems, but also affect the mother. Much literature exists {{about the causes of}} premature birth, clinical manifestations and management of premature infants; but healthcare practitioners, researchers and authors have not reported much on the mothers’ thoughts and feelings while going through the experience of premature labour and birth. This study deals with the experiences of mothers relating to live premature birth and the premature infant at a private hospital in the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Municipality, an urban area within the Eastern Cape Province. The objectives of the study were to explore and describe the experiences of mothers relating to live premature birth and the premature infant at a private hospital in the Eastern Cape Province and to make recommendations based on the research findings which could be utilised by midwives when caring for mothers who had experienced a premature birth. This study, which is qualitative in nature, utilised an explorative, descriptive and contextual design. The population of the study was mothers between the ages of 18 and 38 years who had had a premature birth and were of a gestational age ranging from 28 to 34 weeks. Data collection took place at a private hospital in the Eastern Cape Province over a period of five months. A private room that was designated for the data collection and was not far from the unit where the neonate was kept, proved to be suitable for data-collection purposes. Semi-structured one-on-one interviews were conducted and recorded with an audio digital taperecorder, with a purposefully selected sample of 12 mothers including the pilot study. Data analysis followed formally after data saturation and the data collected was transcribed verbatim and analysed as recommended by Tesch, namely, data coding. An independent coder was used to verify and finalise the results. Two main themes with three sub-themes each and several categories emerged from the data analysis. The two main themes were that: 1. participants had experienced premature birth as an unexpected and traumatic occurrence; and 2. participants had experienced positive support as a coping mechanism throughout the premature birth. <b>Direct</b> <b>quotations</b> <b>were</b> used from the raw data collected to support the description of experiences and findings of this study.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. It {{is common}} to find farm schools some {{distance}} from the villages where learners reside, and in most cases these do not look good from the outside and are normally not given as much support as they should get. There are many challenges facing educators who are teaching learners in farm schools. Some of the problems emanate from home, including the socia-economic status and parental involvement. Other problems are {{as a result of the}} environmental conditions, including a lack of basic services like water, electricity and others. The education system is believed to be failing farm school learners in a way when it comes to issues like a lack of teaching or learning aids, a lack of a referral system, a lack in high schools, a lack of funding, managing and controlling the feeding scheme. At times some additional problems are caused by the learners themselves, including latecoming, absenteeism, a high drop-out rate, teenage pregnancy and vandalism. The bad road conditions and the fact that learners have to walk long distances to school, also impact negatively on the learners. Educators in farm schools feel that they are over-burdened in their task of teaching because of issues like multi-grade classes, too much administration, and lack of support from the department and the parents, as well as financial constraints. The above factors cause much frustration in the teaching profession and educators become drained and experience serious fatigue, which impacts negatively on their work. The aim of this study is to investigate the general perceptions of educators about the health status of farm schools. To attain this aim, the study had following specific objective: To determine the perceptions of educators about the health status of farm schools. A qualitative research design was considered to be the most appropriate for gaining in depth insight into the educators' perceptions about the health status of farm schools. Data was collected through phenomenological semi-structured interviews and direct observations. This data was then organised into categories and subcategories, and <b>direct</b> <b>quotations</b> <b>were</b> presented verbatim. Research findings were compared to the relevant literature to identify existing information and possible differences, and the findings were then recorded The study showed that there are many barriers in farm schools that hinder the smooth running the of school, in other words the learning and teaching. It is necessary to eliminate these barriers where possible, and to minimise and control the barriers that can be detrimental to the health status of farm schools. Findings from this research were classified according to the following main categories: •	Difficult working conditions experienced by educators in the classroom. •	Poor socio-economic status of learners. •	Lack of support to learners from outside the school. •	Dissatisfaction with the Department of Education's management. 	Lack of transport and bad road conditions on the way to school. •	The adverse effect of the status quo on educators. •	Learners’ negative attitude. •	Struggles with helper mothers. Master...|$|E

40|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>quotation</b> as a textual {{strategy}} has different functions in different text-types. In information- oriented text-types, such as scientific texts, {{one of the}} most prominent functions of <b>direct</b> <b>quotations</b> <b>is</b> their contribution to the enhancement of the information load of the text. That <b>is</b> to say, <b>direct</b> <b>quotations</b> in the information – oriented text- type contribute to the ‘ideational meaning’ of the text.   In more speaker – oriented and subjective texts, such as advertisements and journalistic texts, <b>direct</b> <b>quotations</b> mostly contribute to the ‘textual meaning’ of the text. Defining <b>direct</b> <b>quotations</b> as a textual strategy and believing that this strategy adds different dimensions of meaning to the semantic realm of a text in different text-types, in this paper the attempt is to see what dimensions of meaning are added to literary texts through using <b>direct</b> <b>quotations</b> and explore the discoursal values of this textual strategy in the literary text-type. For this purpose three literature texts (one short story and 2 poems) were chosen to be analyzed in terms of the presence of <b>direct</b> <b>quotations</b> in the texts with some speculations on their discoursal functions. We found out that <b>direct</b> <b>quotations</b> <b>are</b> ‘thematically motivated’ elements in literature texts, reinforcing the theme of the text and creating aesthetic effect in such texts.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesisis {{community}} care for the women recovering from a gynaecological surgery. Community care is, by definition, a policy that provides help and support to people at the right time, at the appropriate level, and in the suitable form to enable people to achieve the highest possible level of independence, self-sufficiency and control over their lives. It {{is a set of}} health, social and other services provided to the sick as well as healthy persons, their families, or groups of a specific community. The objective is to provide as much as care at home as possible, even in the event of disablement, reliance on others, or chronic disease. With the growth of the nursing care, it is exactly the individual work and qualifications of the nurses and midwives caring for healthconsolidation, protection and recovery {{that is one of the}} basic characteristic features of an advanced health system. Generally, the time spans of institutional care are getting shorter and this trend can be seen in gynaecologyas well. The primary care is gaining more and more importance. The ongoing health reforms are based on the principles of primary health care which strives to encourage individuals as well as the society to accept responsibility for their health and their healthy lifestyles. Care in the community focuses on the support of health and, in the primary care, is to provide protection of health and prevention of the disease formation. It is more directed at groups of persons and entire communities and draws on their specific needs. The theoretical part of this Bachelor Thesis provides explanations of terms such as "community nursing care", "community", "community care history", and on the practice of thedomiciliary care system in the Czech Republic. The next part focuses on the work of midwives in the primary gynaecological care. Because gynaecology belongs largely to a field of surgery, the thesis also provides categorization of surgical approaches in the gynaecological surgery. The research part of this Bachelor Thesis is concerned with the post-operative period from the perspective of the women. Two main aims were set down. The first aim was to findout whether women undergone genealogical surgeries are interested in community care provided by midwives. The second aim was to find out what is the woman expectation from community care and midwives. Two questions come out from research aims. What is the need of woman undone genealogical surgery after coming home? And how would woman perceive care of midwife? The collection of data was worked out as half structured individual interview. To ensure privacy for all the participants, the interviews were held at a quiet, prearranged setting from February to April 2015. All the respondents provided only oral consent. The information thus obtained was subsequently analysed, sorted into several categories and subcategories and, in order to be clearly understood, represented in well-arranged charts. <b>Direct</b> <b>quotations</b> <b>were</b> used in this thesis. It is written in italics. The research group was made of nine women who went through serious gynaecological surgery. They were able to evaluate their post operative period. In the text they are marked as R 1 -R 9. The results of the research show that the majority of the interviewed women have no idea how community care works. However, they all - with but one exception- showed great interest in the service that would enable them, after they had time to think things over, to call the midwife in order to discuss their problems with a professional person in the quiet of their homes. And indeed, the research discovered that the women are in bad need of such service. For most of the respondents, their first visit at their local gynaecologistfor removal of stiches was a most stressful experience. They all complained about having to wait too long in the doctor's office and about their physicians and nurses being too busy to answer all their questions...|$|E

40|$|The Gospel of John {{contains}} over 50 {{instances of}} direct internal quotation: the <b>direct</b> <b>quotation,</b> {{at a later}} point in the story, of a speech act already given in the narrative. John has dozens more cases than any other New Testament book, making it a demonstrably Johannine device. Furthermore, verifiable <b>quotations</b> <b>are</b> rarely exact independently of who is quoting. The present study examines three aspects of John’s use of <b>direct</b> internal <b>quotation</b> {{in the context of}} Greco-Roman, Jewish, and other New Testament literature. First, the modifications made to the original speech act are placed in the context of paraphrase, a pedagogical exercise taught to adolescents as part of a standard Greek education. Second, the device itself appears in Greco-Roman trial literature and contributes to the Johannine trial motif. Third, the sayings that are quoted have parallels to pre-Johannine material, which suggests that <b>direct</b> internal <b>quotation</b> <b>is</b> a means for John to incorporate traditional sayings while also allowing the Fourth Gospel to modify them or to refute them. The roles of <b>direct</b> internal <b>quotation</b> <b>are</b> then applied to a thematic subset of these sayings that discuss the various advents of Christ in resurrection, parousia, and in his spiritual advent to the church.

In the conclusive part of the thesis existing rules are described and the writer recommends some measures which may lead to changes in public attitudes. Another issue, which goes beyond this thesis and could become a topic for further research, is also outlined. Based on the collected data, in the closing part of the work a hypothesis for a potential quantitative research is stated. The contribution of the thesis is based on the possibility of clarifying complicated relations between physicians and pharmaceutical manufacturers both for professional and general public...|$|R
50|$|The news {{field was}} immeasurably broadened; news style was improved; interviews, newly introduced, lent the ease and {{freshness}} of dialogue and <b>direct</b> <b>quotation.</b> There <b>was</b> a notable {{improvement in the}} reporting of business, markets, and finance. In a few papers the literary department was conducted by staffs as able as any today. A foreign news service was developed that in intelligence, fidelity, and general excellence reached the highest standard yet attained in American journalism. A favorite feature was the series of letters from the editor or other member of the staff who traveled and wrote of what he heard or saw. Bowles, Olmsted, Greeley, Bayard Taylor, Bennett, and many others thus observed life and conditions at home or abroad; and they wrote so entertainingly and to such purpose that the letters—those of Olmsted and Taylor, for instance—are still sources of entertainment or information.|$|R
40|$|This volume {{concerns}} {{the ways in}} which verbal and non-verbal actions are combined and linked in a range of contexts in everyday conversation, in institutional contexts, and in written journalism. The volume includes an introduction which, besides presenting the content of the articles, discusses terminological fundamentals such as the understanding of the terms “clause”, “action” and “linkage” and “combining” in different grammatical traditions and the ways they are conceived of here, as well as open questions collectively formulated by the contributors in planning for the volume concerning the recognition, emergence and distance of linkage, and the ways these questions are addressed in the contributions to the volume. Topics treated in the articles include combining physical actions and verbal announcements in everyday conversation, linking of verbal and nonverbal actions as well as verbal linkages between nonverbal actions by dance teachers building pedagogical activity. Other topics concern the mediation of questions through informal translating in multilingual conversation in order to organize participation, and {{the ways in which}} student requests for clarification and confirmation create learning occasions in a foreign language classroom. Still other articles concern the on-line emergence of alternative questions with the Finnish particle vai ’or’, delayed completions of unfinished turns, the transforming of requests and offers into joint ventures, {{and the ways in which}} <b>direct</b> <b>quotations</b> <b>are</b> created in written journalism from the original talk in the spoken interview. Most of the papers employ Conversation Analysis and Interactional Linguistics as a theoretical framework. The languages used as data are Finnish, English, Estonian, French, Brazilian Portuguese and Swedish. ...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the example}} above [...] {{might be used}} in a novel, it is unbearably awkward to say in more general situations. Quotation clauses as in [...] (<b>direct</b> <b>quotation)</b> or in [...] (indirect <b>quotation)</b> <b>are</b> used instead. The {{particle}} [...] (i)lako <b>is</b> for <b>direct</b> <b>quotation,</b> and the verb endings like [...] -ta-ko, [...] -(nu)nya-ko, [...] -la-ko, and [...] -ca-ko are used for indirect quotation, for declarative, interrogative, imperative, and suggesting sentences respectively. Exceptionally, sentences employing a verbal particle [...] i-ta and an adjective [...] ani-ta are suffixed with -la-ko in place of -ta-ko for declarative ones.|$|R
40|$|The <b>direct</b> <b>quotation</b> <b>is</b> a {{narrative}} device treasured much by writers and readers alike. But the quoted passages {{that appear in}} print are not always carbon copies of the words actually spoken. Writers and reporters—for a number of reasons, some better than others—have been known to misquote those who feed them their steady diet of news. When writers attribute to newsmakers damning words they did not utter, the cry of libel can sound. During the 1991 term, the Supreme Court {{addressed the issue of}} errant quotations in Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc. The plaintiff in Masson did not contend that The New Yorker had negligently misquoted him. Negligently misquoting a public figure is a pardonable offense under the 2 ̆ 2 actual malice 2 ̆ 2 standard articulated in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. The allegedly libeled plaintiff in Masson maintained that the woman who penned his profile deliberately misquoted him in a number of defamatory passages. The Court held that deliberately misquoting a public figure is not actionable unless the alterations materially change the meaning of the actual statement. This Note divides Masson into the three opinions it spawned—that of the Ninth Circuit, the Supreme Court majority, and the Supreme Court dissent. The three opinions differ sharply on the issue of how far wayward a writer may wander when surrounding with quotation marks the words of another. The Ninth Circuit extended broad immunity to writers, mandating very {{little in the way of}} accuracy. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s majority offered significant protection, demanding only that quotes not be terribly errant. The dissent would have offered no protection, requiring writers to either paraphrase or reproduce with painstaking precision their sources 2 ̆ 7 spoken words. The merits, minuses, and prospective effects of the three opinions are the focus of this Note...|$|R
