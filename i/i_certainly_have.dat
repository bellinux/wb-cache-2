The Edge noted that the song contained [...] "a bit of venom", likening it to [...] "the bitter, John Lennon tradition of 'Working Class Hero', slightly snarling and cynical." [...] Bono stated [...] "as we moved from the eighties to the nineties, I stopped throwing rocks at the obvious symbols of power and the abuse of it. I started throwing rocks at my own hypocrisy... 'Acrobat' [...] 'Don't believe what you hear, don't believe what you see / If you just close your eyes / You can feel the enemy...' I can't remember it, but the point is: you start to see the world in a different way, and you're part of the problem, not just part of the solution". In 2006, he noted it was [...] "a song about being a hypocrite, and I think we all can be and <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> been. And you know, you exact very high standards on people in the world but then you don't live them personally", noting the theme was most evident in the lyric [...] "I must be an acrobat to talk like this and act like that". Hot Press editor Niall Stokes felt The Edge's guitar playing combined elements of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] with [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky". Speaking of its theme he said [...] "at its heart is an awareness of the ravages of time, and what it does to people and to relationships. But beyond that, there is the self-awareness that, itself, comes only with experience... Bono acknowledges his own weakness and inadequacy. He is more conscious now than ever before of the contradictions in his own position." [...] Andy Greene of Rolling Stone believed the [...] "aggressive and venomous" [...] song reflected Bono's thoughts during the album sessions, saying [...] "Nearly every lyric brims with rage... It was a new decade and it was quite possible they were about to be dismissed as a relic of the past." ...|$|E

"In {{not seeking}} public {{approval}} or attempting to 'build a following,' no doubt I have sometimes not been careful enough {{about trying to}} be tactful, discreet, and wise {{in dealing with the}} public. [...] <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> never tried to avoid meeting an issue head-on, and I have always been honest and frank in my public statements. [...] This {{may not be the most}} politic course of action, but then I have never had a politician's ambition." ...|$|E
2500|$|Weezer {{completed}} the Pinkerton tour in mid-1997 {{and went on}} hiatus. Wilson returned {{to his home in}} Portland, Oregon to work on his side project, the Special Goodness, and Bell worked on his band Space Twins. Sharp left Weezer to complete the follow-up album for his group the Rentals. He said of his departure from Weezer: [...] "I don't really know how to speak on this because I don't know what should be kept private and what should be shared. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> my view of it, as I'm sure everybody else has their sort of foggy things. When you have a group that doesn't communicate, you're going to {{have a whole lot of}} different stories." ...|$|E
60|$|I was dumfounded. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> not {{understood}} ALL of Enriquez's slang; {{it was always}} so decidedly his own, and peculiar. Yet I could not recall any allusion to this.|$|R
6000|$|I said, [...] "Monsieur exaggerated. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> {{enjoyed the}} {{advantage}} of a little change lately, but not before it had become necessary; and the privilege was by no means exercised in excess." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'He {{has talked}} for three {{quarters}} of an hour by Shrewsbury clock,' says my father, though <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> not talked so long or half so long by my own watch. 'And his discourse has been you, my dear,' says papa, playing with Theodosia's hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] {{explained}} the youth, growing desperate, [...] "you are right. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> a talent--at least a misfortune--of that sort--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I didn't {{comprehend}} your meaning, nor do I now exactly. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> kissed {{nobody on}} the lawn, {{if that is}} really {{what you want to}} know, Elfride.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Elmore, [...] "if that is {{the last}} of him, I ask nothing better. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> no wish to take any steps in the matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{young lady}} was gracious also; but I {{am afraid that}} I cannot carry my praises of the family at Glenbogie any further. The three Tringle ladies {{looked at me as}} I was sitting at table as though <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> no {{business}} in their august society." ...|$|R
6000|$|I just waited, but fairly for admiration. [...] "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> my reasons--as I've no less <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> my luck--for not indeed deserting our dear little battered, {{but still}} just {{sufficiently}} buoyant vessel, from which everyone else appears, I recognise, to s'être sauvé. She'll float {{a few minutes}} more! But (before she sinks!) {{do you mean by}} my grievance----" ...|$|R
60|$|The old man {{let it drop}} with amused disdain. “You {{had better}} take hold of his legs,” he decided without appeal. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> no {{inclination}} to argue. When we lifted him up the head of Señor Ortega fell back desolately, making an awful, defenceless display of his large, white throat.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear, you flatter me. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> had {{my share}} of beauty, but I do not pretend to be {{anything}} extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I've not yet {{smoked a}} pipe with Hawkeye, neither have I seen Muskrat, but <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> {{had a pretty}} long chat with one o' my old friends," [...] {{answered}} Jasper, while a quiet smile played on his face.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} parted with it," [...] she answered, [...] "to my father. On the other hand, <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> not got it. A hundred {{thousand}} dollars {{is a good deal}} of money, Mr. Littleson; but I did not commit theft for the benefit of you and your friends." ...|$|E
60|$|BENNET. I {{think your}} ladyship {{must have been}} misinformed. <b>I</b> most <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> seen none.|$|R
60|$|It was {{something}} more than an idle impulse though. If I had at that time no other qualification for the literary career on which I was entering, <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> this one--an aptitude for discovering points of character in others: and its natural result, an unfailing delight in studying characters of all kinds, wherever I could meet with them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} that {{extremely}} likely, Mrs. Cunningham. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> {{not thought of}} that before, and I hope that for Millicent's sake and my own {{it may turn out}} to be so. I can get on extremely well without it, but at the same time I don't pretend that 50,000 pounds are to be despised." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I've {{forgotten}} {{what happened when}} I was a little boy, it's so long ago," [...] returned the man. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> no desire to eat now, and if I had {{there is nothing in}} the Valley to devour except stones. I suppose eating is a habit you have acquired. Why don't you break yourself of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You for one, of course, cousin Dirck," [...] {{rejoined the}} charming girl, holding {{out her hand}} towards my friend, with a frankness I could have {{dispensed}} with in her; [...] "but, you will remember, Mr. Littlepage, or Master Littlepage as he then was, was a stranger, and I had no such claim on him, as <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> on you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Nay, nay, I deny nothing, my cousin. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> {{heard many}} rumors of the {{existence}} of mines in these hills: and I do believe that I have seen specimens of the precious metals that have been found here. It would occasion me no surprise to learn that tin and silver, or what I consider of more consequence, good coal—” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That has {{but little}} to do with the question, unfortunately. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> like <b>having</b> {{something}} to do. I like earning money." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> wouldn't <b>have</b> thought that. He {{shook his}} head, and added: [...] "Ah! These great, big things, they want some handling." ...|$|R
6000|$|My naturalist {{host and}} my {{scientific}} friend both remarked somewhat grumpily that I {{seemed to get}} the best of all the good things. I might <b>have</b> retaliated that <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> gotten the worst of all the bad jokes; but, being generously happy over my prize, merely remarked: [...] "If you want fame or wealth or wolves, go out and hunt for them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{when she}} {{appealed to me}} this morning, to come and try what I could do to pacify their creditor, this Mr Riah--that <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> gained some little {{influence}} with in transacting business for another friend, but nothing like so much as she supposes--and when a woman like that spoke to me as her dearest Mr Fledgeby, and shed tears--why what could I do, you know?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must apologize, for <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> {{read about}} you," [...] I said. [...] "It was perhaps natural that as I did not send for you I should be {{surprised}} at your taking an interest in my case. I am, however, afraid I cannot retain you, {{for the simple reason}} that I don't know where to raise sufficient money to recompense any capable man's services." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ought {{to refuse}} him! My dear Harriet, {{what do you}} mean? Are you in any doubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been under a mistake. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> been {{misunderstanding}} you, if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer. I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But he {{is quite}} certain now that you mean to take him. Of course we were all certain when you only wanted {{a few more days}} to think of it." [...] Mary felt this to be the cruellest thing of all. [...] "When he asked me I said I wouldn't pledge you, but <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> no doubt. What is the matter, Mary?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, friend, {{for your}} warning. It is well timed. If {{you had not}} spoken <b>I</b> would <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> gone forth to-morrow unprepared." ...|$|R
60|$|My guard halted {{before one}} of the huts into which I was pushed; then two of the creatures squatted down before the entrance--to prevent my escape, doubtless. Though where I should <b>have</b> escaped to <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> not the remotest conception. I had no more than entered the dark shadows of the {{interior}} than there fell upon my ears the tones of a familiar voice, in prayer.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of it," [...] said Isabel,--"thought of it very often, till I have told myself that conduct such as that would be inexpressibly base. What! to eat his bread after refusing him mine when it was {{believed}} to be so plentiful! <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> not face enough to do that,--neither face nor courage for that. There are ignoble things which require audacity altogether beyond my reach." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't expect perfection, but I {{should like}} one {{as good as}} they ever make them nowadays. If you are looking for the honest man, I wish you success in return," [...] said Mac, relinquishing her fan with a glance of such {{sympathetic}} significance that a quick flush of feeling rose to the girl's face as she answered very low, [...] "If honesty was all I wanted, <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> found it in you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is singular," [...] thought I; [...] "there {{seems to}} have been a spell upon my faculties, ever since I have been in this house. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> not been able to do myself justice. Whenever I have {{undertaken}} to advise, I have had the tables turned upon me. It must be that I am strange and diffident among people I am not accustomed to. I wish they could hear me talk at home!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well; {{the life}} of a gentleman farmer is not a bad one; though in his special {{circumstances}} <b>I</b> would <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> recommended a profession." ...|$|R
