40|$|We {{present a}} robust {{implementation}} of the Beneath-Beyond algorithm for computing convex hulls in arbitrary dimension. Certain techniques used are of independent interest {{in the implementation of}} geometric algorithms. In particular, two important, and often complementary, issues are studied, namely exact arithmetic and degeneracy. We focus on integer arithmetic and propose a general and efficient method for its implementation based on modular arithmetic. We suggest that probabilistic modular arithmetic may be of wide interest, as it combines the advantages of modular arithmetic with the speed of randomization. The use of perturbations as a method to cope with <b>input</b> <b>degeneracy</b> is also illustrated. A computationally efficient scheme is implemented which, moreover, greatly simplifies the task of programming. We concentrate on postprocessing, often perceived as the Achilles' heel of perturbations.

40|$|We study two important, {{and often}} complementary, {{issues in the}} {{implementation}} of geometric algorithms, namely exact arithmetic and degeneracy. We focus on integer arithmetic and propose a general and efficient method for its implementation based on modular arithmetic. We suggest that probabilistic modular arithmetic may be of wide interest, as it combines the advantages of modular arithmetic with randomization in order to speed up the lifting of residues to an integer. We derive general error bounds and discuss the implementation of this approach in our general-dimension convex hull program. The use of perturbations as a method to cope with <b>input</b> <b>degeneracy</b> is also illustrated. We present the implementation of a computationally efficient scheme that, moreover, greatly simplifies the task of programming. We concentrate on postprocessing, often perceived as the Achilles' heel of perturbations. Starting {{in the context of a}} specific application in robotics, we examine the complexity of postprocessing and attempt to delimit the cases where perturbations become a hindrance rather than an enhancement. Lastly, we discuss the visualization capabilities of our software and illustrate them for problems in computational algebraic geometry...|$|E
40|$|The logical {{problem of}} {{language}} is grounded on arguments from poverty of positive evidence and arguments from poverty of negative evidence. Careful analysis of child language corpora shows that, if one assumes that children learn through item-based constructions, {{there is an}} abundance of positive evidence. Arguments regarding the poverty of negative evidence can also be addressed by the mechanism of conservative item-based learning. When conservativism is abandoned, children can rely on competition, cue construction, monitoring and probabilistic identification to derive information from positive data to recover from overgeneralization. 1. The Logical Problem Chomsky (1957, 1980) {{has argued that the}} child’s acquisition of grammar is ‘hopelessly underdetermined by the fragmentary evidence available. ’ He attributed this indeterminacy to two major sources. The first is the degenerate nature of the input. According to Chomsky, the sentences heard by the child are so full of retracing, error, and incompletion that they provide no clear indication of the possible sentences of the language. Coupled with this problem of <b>input</b> <b>degeneracy</b> is the problem of unavailability of negative evidence. According to this view, children have a hard time knowing which forms of their language are acceptable and which are unacceptable, because parents fail to provide consistent evidence regarding the ungrammaticality of unacceptable sentences.

40|$|We present UNION 3, a fast {{algorithm}} for computing the volume, area, {{and other}} mass properties, {{of the union}} of many polyhedra. UNION 3 is well suited for parallel machines. A prototype implementation for identical random cubes has processed 20, 000, 000 polyhedra on a dual processor Pentium Xeon workstation in about one hour. UNION 3 processes all the polyhedra in one pass instead of repeatedly combining them pair by pair. The first step finds the candidate output vertices. These are the 3 -face intersections, edge-face intersections, and input vertices. Next, the candidates are culled by deleting those inside any polyhedron. The volume {{is the sum of}} a function of each survivor. There is no statistical sampling. <b>Input</b> <b>degeneracies</b> are processed with Simulation Of Simplicity. Since UNION 3 never explicitly determines the output polyhedron, messy non-manifold cases become irrelevant. No complicated topological structures are computed. UNION 3 ’s simple flat data structures permit it to fork copies of itself to utilize multi-processor machines. The expected time is linear in the number of input, even when the number of intersections is superlinear. The principal data structure is a 3 -D grid of uniform cells. Each cell records overlaps of itself with any edge, face, or polyhedron. Intersection tests are performed only between objects overlapping the sam...|$|R
40|$|When {{studying}} complex environments {{where the}} composing microorganisms are unknown, exploratory tools able to tackle with the biological diversity {{have to be}} proposed. DNA microarrays {{can be a good}} answer if we {{are in a position to}} propose all the probes that could target a specific enzyme. In addition, in the context of new metabolic pathways discovery, it appears that a full backtranslation of oligopeptides is also a promising approach. In both contexts it is preferable to have all the complete nucleic sequences corresponding to an enzyme of interest. In this paper, we revisit existing bioinformatics applications, which bring partial reverse translation solutions, and we propose an algorithm based on <b>input</b> oligopeptide <b>degeneracy</b> able to efficiently compute a complete backtranslation of oligopeptides. This algorithm is precious for the discovery of new organisms and we show its performance on simulated and real biological datasets...|$|R
40|$|The {{mathematical}} {{representation of}} shape and appearance {{is a key}} issue in image-based applications. While the primary aim of 3 D reconstruction is to reconstruct a geometrically accurate surface, real-time view synthesis requires efficient algorithms for computing plausible but not necessarily physically accurate images. These different objectives impose specific requirements {{with respect to the}} underlying shape representations. In this thesis three central problems from the spectrum of image-based techniques are investigated. We developed novel methods of representations and algorithms which on the one hand lead to substantial improvements of existing approaches {{and on the other hand}} offer a unified solution to problems that have previously been considered separately. The first part of this thesis deals with creating animated character models from a set of input images. We propose a deformable, template-based shape representation which enables us to develop new solutions for problems such as camera estimation, shape deformation and tracking, and character reconstruction. We will present a variety of character animations created from single images to full body reconstructions and animations from video. The second part of this thesis focuses on the difficulty of rendering novel views of general, static scenes instead of dynamic characters. Here, the key component is a generic, particle-based geometry representation which supports an accurate handling of object silhouettes and pixel-accurate rendering of arbitrary scenes. Every step of the process is completely implemented on the GPU in order to allow real-time, unconstrained user navigation through a photorealistic virtual reproduction of the original scene. Finally, the third part concentrates on accurate 3 D surface reconstruction. We will present a new volumetric solution to the problems of multi-view stereo and point cloud reconstruction which allows computing 3 D models with a high accuracy as well as being robust to <b>input</b> <b>degeneracies.</b> Additionally, it is shown that the choice of input images is an important factor for optimizing the quality as well as the performance of image-based reconstruction techniques...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} design {{microarray}} oligonucleotides, {{in the context}} of new metabolic pathways discovery, it appears that a full backtranslation of oligopeptides is a promising approach. Protein to DNA reverse translation is a time-consuming task that can provide unreasonable quantities of data. This is why most current applications use genetic degenerated code or data mining-based techniques to select the best reverse translation of a short protein sequence called oligopeptide. When the purpose is only to design short oligos it is particularly interesting to have the complete sequences to solve the design problems of enzyme specific oligos for microarrays. In this paper, we revisit existing bioinformatics applications, which bring reverse translation solutions, and we present a new algorithm based on <b>input</b> oligopeptide <b>degeneracy</b> able to efficiently compute a full reverse translation. We propose an implementation with the C programming language and we show its performance statistics on simulated and real biological datasets...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOur work goes towards {{answering}} the growing {{need for the}} robust and efficient manipulation of curved objects in numerous applications. The kernel of the CGAL library provides several functionalities which are, however, mostly restricted to linear objects. We focus here on the arrangement of conic arcs in the plane. Our first contribution is the design, implementation and testing of a kernel for computing arrangements of circular arcs. A preliminary C++ implementation exists also for arbitrary conic curves. We discuss the representation and predicates of the geometric objects. Our implementation is targeted {{for inclusion in the}} CGAL library. Our second contribution concerns exact and efficient algebraic algorithms for the case of conics. They treat all <b>inputs,</b> including <b>degeneracies,</b> and they are implemented as part of the library SYNAPS 2. 1. Our tools include Sturm sequences, resultants, Descartes' rule, and isolating points. Thirdly, our experiments on circular arcs show that our methods compare favorably to existing alternatives using CORE 1. 6 x and LEDA 4. 5...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by the {{analysis}} of range queries in databases, we introduce the computation of the Depth Distribution of a set B of axis aligned boxes, whose computation generalizes that of the Klee's Measure and of the Maximum Depth. In the worst case over instances of fixed input size n, we describe an algorithm of complexity within O(n^d+ 1 / 2 n), using space within O(n n), mixing two techniques previously used to compute the Klee's Measure. We refine this result and previous results on the Klee's Measure and the Maximum Depth for various measures of difficulty of the input, such as {{the profile of the}} <b>input</b> and the <b>degeneracy</b> of the intersection graph formed by the boxes.

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory for {{non-degenerate}} parametric resonance in a tunable superconducting cavity. We focus on nonlinear effects that {{are caused by}} nonlinear Josephson elements connected to the cavity. We analyze parametric amplification in a strong nonlinear regime at the parametric instability threshold, and calculate maximum gain values. Above the threshold, in the parametric oscillator regime the linear cavity response diverges at the oscillator frequency at all pump strengths. We show that this divergence {{is related to the}} continuous degeneracy of the free oscillator state with respect to the phase. Applying on-resonance <b>input</b> lifts the <b>degeneracy</b> and removes the divergence. We also investigate the quantum noise squeezing. It is shown that in the strong amplification regime the noise undergoes four-mode squeezing, and that in this regime the output signal to noise ratio can significantly exceed the input value. We also analyze the intermode frequency conversion and identify parameters at which full conversion is achieved. Comment: 21 pages, 15 fig...|$|R
