In 1937, {{he moved the}} company to Château-Thierry where he {{purchased}} 12th century cellars, that measure 2.5 kilometres in length and 30 meters in depth. Here he found {{the perfect place to}} age his wines and this gave Champagne Pannier a new dimension. In 1974, a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>growers,</b> now called Covama, joined forces and purchased the house of Pannier.

During a detailed study of the cellars, a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> archaeologists found a medieval stone carving of an archer in 2002. This archer became the symbol of Champagne Pannier extolling the same virtues of the wine: balance, precision, integrity.|$|R

40|$|Various {{forms of}} revenue {{insurance}} {{have been applied}} in Canada and in the US with relative success. In this paper different combinations of traditional agricultural policies and revenue and yield insurance are analysed for the Spanish olive oil sector. Taking a database containing about half million Spanish olive growers during 8 campaigns, five possible policies are studied {{and the results are}} examined according to different criteria including average revenue and its variability, growers utility gains, taxpayers cost and the transfer efficiency of support. The policies analysed are: (1) non-intervention; (2) the policy currently in force in Spain that combines a production aid with a yield insurance; (3) a revenue insurance, only; (4) revenue insurance combined with a production aid; and (5) an aid per tree in combination with revenue insurance. The methodology is based on Monte-Carlo simulations performed on about 100 <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>growers</b> that have been grouped according to their expected yields and variability. Assuming and estimating olive oil price and yields correlations for each <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>growers,</b> the analysis allows for consistent policy comparisons at a very disaggregate level. Using the results for all analysed groups, policies are ranked based on the above criteria at the provincial and national levels. Results show that the current regime of EU production aids of olive oil eliminates the advantage of extending the current yield insurance to a revenue insurance. It is also shown that the level of support delivered by production aids cannot be reached with revenue insurance even with completely subsidised premiums. Finally, it is shown that the policy that combines tree aids with revenue insurance exhibits good results for all examining criteria.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study are to examine differences in prices that safari sunset flower growers from Israel receive on the Dutch flower bursa, suggest factors that influence such differences, and examine strength and significance of each factor. We show that price differences between growers can reach 36 % - 47 %. In the regression model price differences are regressed on explanatory variables that include proxies for flower quality and grower reputation. The model explains 58 % - 59 % of the price variability and enables to compare elasticity of price by the studied factors. Subsequent ordered probit analysis confirmed the relevance of the chosen variables and their ability to explain also the growers clustering by received prices.

A major drawback to infield loading and direct-haul is the resulting soil compaction and stool damage, {{which has been}} documented in sugar industries worldwide. Megatons (Pty) Ltd is a harvesting and transport group that was formed by a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>growers</b> committed to long-term high quality cane yields with minimal infield damage.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to establish an empirical relationship between household characteristics and tobacco growers’ perception {{of the impact of}} the FDA regulation. A logistic model is applied on primary data that came from the Center for Tobacco Grower Research’s (CTGR’s) 2011 mail survey of tobacco producers. Results indicate that over 80 percent of the sample tobacco growers are concerned about the impact of the FDA regulation. The profiles <b>of</b> <b>growers</b> who reported to be concerned about the impact of the FDA regulation are not significantly different from those <b>of</b> <b>growers</b> who reported that they are not concerned or somewhat concerned. This result highlights the importance <b>of</b> engaging all <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>growers</b> in discussion to elaborate whether, and if so how the FDA regulation would actually affect tobacco production, and how growers should adjust in light of the expected changes. This would help growers build confidence in the industry, and work towards making the necessary changes in agricultural practices that would help address the regulatory issues related to the contents of tobacco products. Given the widespread concern, the failure to do so could have a negative impact on resource allocation and investment decisions because of an overreaction to a potentially erroneous perception {{of the impact of the}} FDA regulation.

Currently we can find three major types <b>of</b> <b>growers</b> in floriculture. They are Large Commercial Ventures Middle Level growers and Village Level growers. Both Middle Level and Village level growers usually go for low cost cultivation with minimum advanced techniques sticking to conventional methods. Orchid cultivation is more pleasurable and profitable than any other floriculture ventures. As the orchid cultivation is so pleasurable we can introduce another <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>growers</b> who cultivate orchid in their home gardens for making their home gardens beautiful. But the problem is that most <b>of</b> these <b>growers</b> may not have the knowledge to identify the specie of the plants as {{there are a number of}} similar looking plants which are in different species. And also they may not have the knowledge about the orchid diseases. Because of that they may not be able to get the maximum outcome from their cultivations. So the aim of our project is to address the above mentioned issues by introducing a system which can identify orchid species amp diseases and predict the healthiness of the orchid plants. The only input to this system is an image of an orchid leaf and the system will provide the orchid specie name diseases if there any healthiness of the orchid plant and suggestions to overcome the issues associated with the orchid plant as the output. We identify the orchid species and diseases by extracting the features of orchid plant leaf in the input image using image processing technics and with the use of data mining technics we predict the healthiness of the orchid plant. So this system will be a great help for the people who love to grow orchids but dont have knowledge about the orchid species and diseases.
