25|$|In 1877, Patterson was criminally {{prosecuted for}} defrauding depositors, {{including}} {{encouraging people to}} deposit money when he knew {{that they would not}} be repaid. Foolishly, Patterson did not prepare for trial, hiring a lawyer at the last minute. Hungerford was the first witness to testify about the bank's beginnings. Later testimony showed that Patterson knew his bank was going to fail for the past five years. According to an auditor's report, in January 23, 1875, Patterson's bank had liabilities of $96,669.89, but only $5,931.30 of available resources and $36,498.47 of contingent resources, i.e., money in Patterson's individual account, leaving an overall shortage of $54,240.12. Patterson claimed that he was actually solvent at all times because bank <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> covered any alleged shortages.

Historian Chester Hearn believed that [...] "he source of his fortune is a mystery, but much of it came from New Orleans..."

[...] Successful postwar investments included a granite company on Cape Ann and a barge freight operation on the Merrimack River. [...] After learning that no domestic manufacturer produced bunting, he invested in another Lowell mill to produce it, and convinced the federal government to enact legislation requiring domestic sources for material used on government buildings. [...] Less successful ventures included <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> in the Virginia, Colorado, and the Baja Peninsula of western Mexico, and a fraudulent gold mining operation in North Carolina.

40|$|Insurance {{companies}} play {{two major}} {{roles in the}} economy. First is providing indemnification and second is institutional investment. This study’s {{focus is on the}} latter role in Nigeria. The study examined the perception of insurance companies about <b>real</b> asset <b>in</b> their portfolio and factors that influence <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> the asset. Structured questionnaires were distributed to fifty-two insurance companies in Lagos State. Data collected were presented in tables and analysed with statistical tools such as percentages, mean and relative importance index for ease of understanding. It was found that capital security and portfolio stability (diversification) were the principal driving motive for investing <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> while liquidity concern, high transaction costs, inadequate infrastructure development in the country and unreliable valuation data among others constitute major factors militating against <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate.</b> It was further found that <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> is currently far below what the law stipulates in Nigeria. The paper therefore concludes by suggesting that insurance companies need to see <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> as attractive investment asset and invest <b>in</b> creating comprehensive <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> submarket rather than cherry-pick manner <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> properties...|$|R
