40|$|Discomfort during load {{carriage}} is a {{major issue}} for activities using backpacks (e. g. infantry maneuvers, children carrying school supplies, or outdoor sports). It is currently unclear which mechanical parameters are responsible for subjectively perceived discomfort. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify objectively measured mechanical predictors of discomfort during load carriage. We compared twelve different configurations of a typical load carriage system, a commercially available backpack with a <b>hip</b> <b>belt.</b> The pressure distribution under the <b>hip</b> <b>belt</b> and the shoulder strap, as well as the tensile force in the strap and the relative motion of the backpack were measured. Multiple linear regression analyses were con-ducted to investigate possible predictors of discomfort. The results demonstrate that static peak pressure, or alternatively, static strap force is a significant (p< 0. 001) predictor of dis-comfort during load carriage in the shoulder and hip region, accounting for 85 % or more of the variation in discomfort. As an additional finding, we discovered that the regression coef-ficients of these predictors are significantly smaller for the hip than for the shoulder region. As static peak pressure is measured directly on the body, it is less dependent on the type of load carriage system than static strap force. Therefore, static peak pressure is well suited as a generally applicable, objective mechanical parameter for the optimization of load car-riage system design. Alternatively, when limited to load carriage systems of the type back-pack with <b>hip</b> <b>belt,</b> static strap force is the most valuable predictor of discomfort. The regionally differing regression coefficients of both predictors imply that the hip region is sig-nificantly more tolerant than the shoulder region. In order to minimize discomfort, users should be encouraged to shift load from the shoulders to the hip region wherever possible, at the same time likely decreasing the risk of low back pain or injury...|$|E

40|$|While backpacks are {{commonly}} used to transfer extra load, they are sometimes associated with negative effects on the body. The broad aim of this thesis was to study the effect of backpack loading configurations on postural stability, physiological variables, perceived exertion, and interface pressure and compare them to an unloaded condition. The specific aims of this thesis were to: 1) systematically review the literature and identify relevant deficits in knowledge; 2) assess the test-retest reliability and criterion validity of a force plate which has unknown psychometric properties; 3) {{examine the effect of}} carrying a 20 % of body weight loaded backpack and load placement in a backpack (high vs. low load placement) on postural stability, physiological variables and backpack-shoulder interface pressure; 4) assess the effect of <b>hip</b> <b>belt</b> use on postural stability; and 5) investigate the effect of shoulder strap width on backpack-shoulder interface pressure. These aims were investigated using force plates, a metabolic cart, pressure sensors, and questionnaires. Our results indicated that carrying loaded backpacks decreased postural stability, increased physiological variables and perceived exertion as compared to an unloaded condition. While a <b>hip</b> <b>belt</b> did not enhance postural stability, participants reported a perception of increased stability and less exertion. Load placement did not influence postural stability, physiological variables, perceived stability or exertion; however, participants reported lower levels of local perceived exertion at the shoulders and the upper back regions when the load was placed low in the backpack. Conversely, low load placement resulted in higher shoulder interface pressure as compared to high load placement. Shoulder strap width also affected shoulder interface pressure with wide shoulder straps associated with lower shoulder interface pressure. While we identified several aspects of backpack configuration and loading characteristics and their effects on postural stability, energy cost, interface pressure and perceived exertion, additional study of backpack configuration and the resulting impact on biomechanical and physiologic characteristics is required...|$|E
40|$|Name on Graduation Programme: Bassey-Duke, Elizabeth MissanBackground: Agriculture plays a {{vital role}} in the economy of any industrially {{developing}} country, including South Africa. In the Eastern Cape of South Africa citrus farming is a significant contributor to the local economy (Johnson et al., 2005). The harvesting phase of citrus farming is performed manually and exposes workers to physical risks, which can lead to the development of musculoskeletal disorders. In particular, the standard harvesting bag comprises of a single shoulder strap and promotes asymmetrical load carriage which results in shoulder and lower back pain complaints. The current study compared the physiological (EMG), perceptual (RPE), usability (PUEU) and productivity effects of two new harvesting bag designs (a <b>hip</b> <b>belt</b> and a backpack bag design) to the standard harvesting bag design. This was performed in a laboratory as well as a field setting. Methods (Laboratory phase) : 36 participants (12 males and 24 females) were assigned to one worker group. The “tall ladder worker” group was comprised of only males and the “step ladder worker” and “ground worker” group of females. Each participant was required to simulate a citrus harvesting task while utilizing each of the bag designs on different days. On each day/test session, participants performed three harvesting cycles. Muscle activity was measured throughout the entire testing session and RPE were recorded {{at the end of each}} cycle. Results (Laboratory phase) : The EMG and RPE results indicate that the backpack design was the most ideal design to reduce asymmetry, while the standard harvesting bag design was the worst. Although not significant, there was greater muscle asymmetry (p= 0. 109) and a significantly higher perceived exertion when using the standard bag (p= 0. 0004), in comparison to using the backpack. Methods (Field phase) : 17 Xhosa-speaking citrus harvesters (6 females and 11 males) participated in this study. Each harvester worked with one of the three bag designs on a different day. Productivity of each worker was assessed every hour by recording the number of bags filled with fruit and at the end of the shift. A Perceived Usefulness & Ease of Use questionnaire was presented to each participant to obtain feedback on worker acceptance to the new bag designs. ii Results (Field phase) : A general trend in support of the <b>hip</b> <b>belt</b> bag design over the other two bag designs were found, even within the different worker demographic groups (age, sex and worker experience). The workers perceived less exertion (7. 98 ± 1. 86) and were more productive (9. 90 ± 2. 11 bags/hour) when using the <b>hip</b> <b>belt</b> design; they also found this bag the most useful (1. 02 ± 0. 09) and easy to use (1. 07 ± 0. 25). In contrast, the backpack bag design had significantly poorer responses when compared to the other two bag designs and this was evident in all the dependent variables assessed (RPE, productivity and PUEU). Conclusion: The results from the laboratory phase supported the expectation that the backpack bag design reduces asymmetry and hence, is more suitable than the standard harvesting bag. However, results from the field show that the <b>hip</b> <b>belt</b> bag design was the most preferred and the backpack was the least preferred. Bao & Shahnavaz (1989) highlight the need for ergonomics researcher to convey laboratory findings into the field context. However, as shown by the current study, there are numerous challenges associated with field work, making it difficult for laboratory findings to be successfully conveyed to the field. Limitations and Recommendations: For the laboratory phase of the project, no biomechanical and cardiovascular responses were assessed. However, for a holistic approach, these variables should be considered in future studies. Due to high variability from one harvesting cycle to another, more than three harvesting cycles should also be performed to accurately replicate the harvesting process as done in the field over extended durations of time. For the field phase, data should be collected from more than one citrus farm and thus a larger sample size could be obtained. This would improve the validity of the study. In addition to this, data should be collected for a full working day, especially if environmental conditions are not a hindrance, as well as for a whole season, since workloads vary, depending on the time of the harvesting season...|$|E

Heil Montana State University, Bozeman, MT To {{accurately}} control locomotion {{speed and}} grade, load carriage studies are commonly performed in lab settings. However, {{it may be}} more appropriate to perform these same studies in outdoor settings. For example, a recent study in our lab assessed the energetic and kinematic effects of hiking with an armored tactical vest commonly worm by active military ground troops. To control outdoor hiking speed, a hand-held GPS monitor was used by investigators to pace the test subjects as they hiked a level trail under different load carriage conditions. The accuracy and repeatability of this technique for controlling outdoor hiking speed, however, has never been evaluated. PURPOSE: To determine the validity and reliability of using a hand-held GPS monitor to control overground hiking speed of subjects performing outdoor load carriage studies. METHODS: Nine women (mean±SD: 27 ± 7 years; 163. 1 ± 6. 1 cm; 62. 5 ± 10. 3 kg) and eight men (24 ± 4 years; 179. 5 ± 6. 0 cm; 81. 7 ± 12. 5 kg) performed outdoor hiking tests {{as part of a larger}} study of wearing a Modular Tactical Vest (MTV) both with and without a <b>hip</b> <b>belt.</b> The three hiking conditions (hiking without MTV; hiking with MTV; and hiking with MTV plus a <b>hip</b> <b>belt)</b> were each performed at three goal speeds: 67. 0 m/min (2. 5 mph); 80. 4 m/min (3. 0 mph); 93. 8 m/min (3. 5 mph), for a total of 9 trials. For each trial, subjects followed an investigator (i. e. pacer) with a hand-held GPS monitor with instructions to stay within 1 - 2 m of the pacer at all times.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} load in backpacks and other load carriage systems over the last decades, load carriage system designs have to be adapted accordingly to minimize discomfort and {{to reduce the risk}} of injury. As subject studies are labor-intensive and include further challenges such as intra-subject and inter-subject variability, we aimed to validate an instrumented dummy as an objective laboratory tool to assess the mechanical aspects of discomfort. The validation of the instrumented dummy was conducted by comparison with a recent subject study. The mechanical parameters that characterize the static and dynamic interaction between backpack and body during different backpack settings were compared. The second aim was to investigate whether high predictive power (coefficient of determination R 2 > 0. 5) in assessing the discomfort of load carriage systems could be reached using the instrumented dummy. Measurements were conducted under static conditions, simulating upright standing, and dynamic conditions, simulating level walking. Twelve different configurations of a typical load carriage system, a commercially available backpack with a <b>hip</b> <b>belt,</b> were assessed. The mechanical parameters were measured in the shoulder and the hip region of the dummy and consisted of average pressure, peak pressure, strap force and relative motion between the system and the body. The twelve configurations consisted of three different weights (15 kg, 20 kg, and 25 kg), combined with four different <b>hip</b> <b>belt</b> tensions (30 N, 60 N, 90 N, and 120 N). Through the significant (p< 0. 05) correlation of the mechanical parameters measured on the dummy with the corresponding values of the subject study, the dummy was validated for all static measurements and for dynamic measurements in the hip region to accurately simulate the interaction between the human body and the load carriage system. Multiple linear regressions with the mechanical parameters measured on the dummy as independent variables and the corresponding subjective discomfort scores from the subject study as the dependent variable revealed a high predictive power of the instrumented dummy. The dummy can explain 75 % or more of the variance in discomfort using average pressures as predictors and even 79 % or more of the variance in discomfort using strap forces as predictors. Use of the dummy enables objective, fast, and iterative assessments of load carriage systems and therefore reduces the need for labor-intensive subject studies in order to decrease the mechanical aspects of discomfort during load carriage...|$|E
40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The work presented in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} measurement of gait and posture parameters and their variation due to load weight, gender and load carriage duration when carrying military loads. In particular it examines the load carriage system as a whole rather than the backpack alone, which has been the concentration of previous biomechanicalload carriage research. The aims of the thesis work were to (1) develop a protocol for examining the effect of the military LCS on gait and posture; (2) investigate the changes in gait and posture parameters in response to load weight, load position, gender and duration of load carriage; and (3) {{to gain a better understanding}} of the contributors to good load carriage system design through assessment with end users. Using Coda™ motion analysis a protocol was developed to investigate gait and posture of a participant by examining changes to lower limb and upper body movement. In order to address aims 2 and 3, the thesis consists of 2 parts. The fIrst part concentrates on short term load carriage. The fIrst trial examined the effect of military boots, indicating restricted ankle movement when wearing such footwear. Three other experimental trials examining the effect of load, gender and load carriage design were also conducted. In the lower limb increased load resulted in increased range of motion of all joints measured. The increase in ankle and femur movement, and decrease in knee movement was greatest for females. However, anthropometric data show that the gender effect could be due to body size alone. The factors studies all altered the range of motion of the lower limb, with increases in range of motion associated with an increased energy cost when carrying loads. Change in the forward lean of the participants was also noted, with greater forward lean as load was increased. Gender differences were seen, with females experiencing a greater range of motion of the trunk than their male counterparts; regardless of body size. Whilst these issues are important to consider, short term load carriage rarely occurs within Defence tasks. Therefore, the second half of the thesis concentrates on longer duration load carriage. Two experimental trials, one in the laboratory and one in the field, were completed. Longer duration carriage resulted in increased range of motion of the lower limb, greater forward lean, a more forward head position and increased discomfort over time. This increased discomfort was particularly evident in the shoulders and the feet. The work highlights the importance of collecting subjective data as discomfort is often the limiting factor when considering the ability to complete a load carriage task. Two different load carriage system designs (webbing + backpack) were considered as part of this work. Experimental work examining the effect on short term and lo"ng term load carriage is discussed. Two systems were examined, the Standard Issue system (currently in service in the British Army) and a prototype system (Airmesh). The Airmesh design presents a system that includes a <b>hip</b> <b>belt</b> and redistributes some of the load onto the front of the body via vest webbing as opposed to the standard design were the predominant amount of the load is on the back and supported by the shoulders. During short term load carriage minimal change was seen between systems, with the exception of less forward lean when carrying the Airmesh design and less trunk range of motion. When longer duration carriage was examined again a more upright walking posture was noted when carrying the Airmesh system, however greater trunk movement was seen. This may have serious implications for the physiological strain that an individual is placed under during longer term carriage. However, the more upright posture may present a safer option in terms of lower back stress and injury. This thesis concludes that a methodology is now in place to examine the changes in gait and posture whilst carrying military loads. The response due to increased load weight, gender, design and increased load carriage duration has also been studied with significant outcomes observed. Concentration in future research should be on including the entire load carriage system and examining the SUbjective response of individuals as well as important· biomechanical and physiological data. This will allow a more complete assessment of the effect military load has on the human body...|$|E
