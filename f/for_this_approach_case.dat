I substantiated, inter alia, the replacement of the small town elites by two examples of Jan Satrapa and Karel Bartušek whose fates appeared to be very applicable <b>for</b> <b>this</b> way <b>approached</b> <b>case</b> study. I also attempted to record the changes of the common cultural and ideological period trends within this municipality. Directed through the specific fates, I described the shape of the small town after February 25, 1948 and compared it with the specialised literature thereby I tried to place the case of Studená in the contemporary context. To acheive the needed results, I used the sources of personal data and the memory data (family and municipal chronicles), conversations with survivors, and likewise the books of Vlasta Javořická. They proved to be extremely valuable sources...|$|R
40|$|Computer {{simulation}} of long missions in space can provide experience and predictions without the expense {{and risk of}} actual flights. Simulations are most helpful if they can model the behavior of key psychological factors of the crew over time, rather than simply predicting overall mission success. Because {{of the lack of}} experience with interplanetary trips and the problems of generalizing and adapting data on analog missions, {{it is not possible to}} formulate a set of formal rules adequate for building an expert system. Rather, a case-based reasoning approach to constructing a time series model is pursued. Even <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach,</b> however, the <b>case</b> base must be supplemented by adaptation rules. These rules of thumb are gleaned from the social science literature on small group interactions under extreme conditions of isolation and confinement.

The issues treated include the relation between the public and the private space in the context of political activity, the interrelation between social change and change within the family and the relationship between generations—in terms of politics and the processes that provide the motivation for the individual to participate in social movements. The volume attempts to contribute to a change of paradigms in the research of social movements. Ingrid MIETHE and Silke ROTH accomplish this aim, presenting a well-chosen and balanced choice of theoretical and empirical contributions, stretching the limits of the traditional research of social movements.

40|$|Subject of research. The {{problem of}} {{stabilization}} for biped walking robots {{on the surface}} is considered. The angle and angular velocity of the movable surface varies randomly in a limited range. Methods. Two approaches of stabilization of biped robots are proposed. The first approach requires the construction of kinematic and dynamic models of the robot. Dynamic equations were obtained using the Euler-Lagrange method. The control algorithm {{is based on the}} method of inverse dynamics, in which the original nonlinear dynamic model is linearized by a feedback. The second stabilization algorithm uses only the kinematic model of the robot. A hybrid controller is developed <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach.</b> In the <b>case</b> of low angular velocities of the movable support the robot stabilization is performed by PD controller {{on the basis of the}} angle error of deflection of the servo shaft. In the case of relatively high angular velocities of the support the controller also uses the gyroscope readings mounted in the robot torso. Maintenance of the robot’s gravity center over the center of bearing area for providing a stable position was chosen as a goal of control in both approaches. Main results. Efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approaches for stabilization of biped robots on the moving surface are demonstrated by the numerical simulation. Both methods provide stability of the balancing robots on changing the angle of inclination and angular velocity of the moving surface in the ranges ( 50 ; 50 ) and ( 40  / sec; 40  / sec), respectively. Comparative analysis of these approaches under identical requirements for quality indicators of transients is also provided: transient time 0. 2 sec п t  and overshoot   0 %.

40|$|Die Bewegungsforschung ist durch die strikte Trennung von Biografie und Politik an ihre Grenzen gestoßen. Eine produktive Verbindung von Biografie und Politik, Privat und Öffentlichkeit lässt sich durch die biografische Perspektive in die Bewegungsforschung einbringen. Individueller und kollektiver Wandel sind immer in Bezug zueinander zu sehen. Nur so können Bedingungen politischen Handelns adäquat dargestellt werden. Die wissenschaftliche Vielfältigkeit und Notwendigkeit dieses Forschungsansatzes wird in diesem Band anhand von Fallstudien zu Transformationsprozessen in Deutschland, Polen, Russland, China und den USA dargestellt. Die Fallstudien umfassen Friedens-, Frauen-, Bürgerrechts-, Exil-, Gewerkschafts- und rechtsextreme Bewegungen. Thematisiert werden das Verhältnis von Öffentlichkeit und Privatheit im Kontext politischer Aktivität, Zusammenhänge von sozialem und familialem Wandel, politische Generationenverhältnisse sowie Motivationsprozesse für die Teilnahme an sozialen Bewegungen. Der Band will damit zu einem Paradigmenwechsel in der Bewegungsforschung beitragen. Ingrid MIETHE und Silke ROTH gelingt dies durch die gut ausgewählte Kombination theoretischer und empirischer Beiträge in diesem Band, mit denen die Grenzen bisheriger Bewegungsforschung überschritten werden.

Por la estricta separación entre biografía y políticas, la investigación de movimientos sociales ha encontrado sus límties. La perspectiva biográfica puede introducir una combinación productiva de biografía y política, espacios públicos y privados dentro de la investigación de los movimientos sociales. El cambio individual y colectivo siempre tiene que ser visto en conexión estrecha. El volumen describe la flexibilidad científica y la necesidad de utilizar esta perspectiva. Presenta estudios de caso de procesos de transformación en Alemania, Polonia, Rusia, China y los Estados Unidos. Los estudios de caso incluyen una variedad de grupos de presión como movimientos de paz, derechos de las mujeres, exiliados, tratados internacionales y grupos extremistas de derecha. Los asuntos que se abordan incluyen la relación de los espacios públicos y privados en el contexto de la actividad política, la interrelación entre cambio social y cambio dentro de la familia, así como la relación entre generaciones en términos de políticas y de procesos que ofrecen la motivación para que un individuo participe en movimientos sociales. El volumen intenta contribuir al cambio de paradigma en la investigación de los movimientos sociales.
