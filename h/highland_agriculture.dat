5000|$|The Highland Clearances {{were part}} of the Scottish Agricultural Revolution but {{happened}} later and over a shorter time span than the same process in the Scottish Lowlands, in England and, to a large extent, elsewhere in Europe. The growing cities of the Industrial Revolution presented an increased demand for food; land came to be seen as an asset to meet this need, and as a source of profit, rather than a means of support for its resident population. Before improvement, <b>Highland</b> <b>agriculture</b> was based on runrig arable areas under the common management of the community and common land for grazing; those working in this system lived in townships or [...] With no individual leases or ownership of plots of such land, there is little incentive to improve it (for instance by drainage, or using crop rotation systems). Nor, with common grazing, could an individual owner improve the quality of his stock. Enclosure of the common lands and the runrig fields incentivised improvement, but, more importantly, allowed a change in land use. In many clearances, this change was the replacement of mixed farming (in which cattle provided a cash crop) with large-scale sheep farming. In most cases, shepherds were recruited from outside the Highlands to manage these flocks, so the entire existing population were displaced, either being removed to crofts on the same estate, going to other land in the Highlands, migrating to the industrial cities of Scotland or, more commonly in later clearances, emigrating.|$|E

40|$|Oribius {{species are}} small flightless weevils endemic {{to the island}} of New Guinea and far {{northern}} Cape York, Australia. The adults feed externally on leaves, developing fruit and green bark, but their impact as pests and general host use patterns are poorly known. Working in Eastern Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea, we carried out structured host use surveys, farmer surveys, shade-house growth trials, and on-farm and on-station impact trials to: (i) estimate the host range of the local Oribius species; (ii) understand adult daily activity patterns; (iii) elucidate feeding habits of the soil dwelling larvae; and (iv) quantify the impacts of adult feeding damage. Oribius inimicus and O. destructor accounted for nearly all the Oribius species encountered locally: of these two O. inimicus was the most abundant. Weevils were collected from 31 of 33 plants surveyed in the Aiyura Valley and a combination of farmer interviews and literature records provided evidence for the beetles being pestiferous on 43 crops currently or previously grown in the Highlands. Adult weevils had a distinct diurnal pattern {{of being in the}} upper plant canopy early in the morning and, to a lesser extent, again late in the afternoon. For the remainder of the day beetles resided within the canopy, or possibly off the plant. Movement of adults between plants appeared frequent. Pot trials confirmed the larvae are root feeders. Quantified impact studies showed that the weevils are damaging to a range of vegetable and orchard crops (broccoli, capsicum, celery, French bean, Irish potato, lettuce, orange and strawberry), causing average yield losses of around 30 - 40 %, but up to 100 % on citrus.

This Report borrows heavily from collaborative research in Ethiopia and Ethiopian Agricultural Research Organization, ICRISAT, ILRI and other colleagues that seek to determine the conflicting attributes of livestock in <b>highland</b> <b>agriculture</b> and thus develop technologies and policy options to ameliorate the negative attributes and accentuate the positive social and environmental effects...|$|E
40|$|Problems {{associated}} with land degradation are serious in China. Sloping land in South China {{has experienced a}} decline in crop productivity by 30 - 60 % due to soil erosion {{and it has been}} predicted that most topsoil will be lost within the next 100 years if current erosion rates continue. Considering these situations, an agro-environmental research and development project (Sustainable <b>Highland</b> <b>Agriculture</b> in South-East Asia – SHASEA) was conducted in a catchment in Yunnan Province, China, to address the objectives of increasing crop productivity in sustainable and environmentally-friendly ways. A range of cropping practices was developed and implemented in a rural upland catchment (Wang Jia). At the end of the project, farmers were surveyed to evaluate project effectiveness. All farmers from Wang Jia Catchment, who were involved in project implementation, were surveyed. A sample of farmers working in an adjacent catchment (not {{associated with}} the project) was surveyed for comparative purposes. Farmers had different perceptions of the cropping practices employed. Contour cultivation was preferred and likely to be adopted. Others practices such as straw mulching and intercropping were seen as less appropriate and unlikely to be adopted. Polythene mulch was recognized as effective, but likely to be adopted only if financial returns were favourable. The availability of relevant information had an important impact on the extent of technology testing by farmers and their willingness to adopt the practices in the future...|$|E

Regardless of medium of analysis or theoretical bent, many archaeological studies today focus on economic intensification. The Philippine example described in this case study is valuable because ofthe abundance of documentation available on parameters that archaeologists commonly employ, such as context, concentration, scale, and intensity (see Costin 1991, Pool 1992). This study focuses on productive intensification as it is expressed through ceramic production in Dalupa, a Kalinga wet-rice farming village in the <b>highland</b> Philippines.

40|$|Today, 60 % of Filipinos {{make their}} {{livelihood}} {{in some form}} of forestry or agriculture. Throughout history the Philippines has seen extensive tree cutting by commercial logging operations of valuable hardwoods. Heavy logging of mountain hardwoods date back to colonial times and continues today. Over 90 % of the nation's primary forest have been cleared. (Croke, Thomas, & Lunt 1999) Modern logging techniques were first introduced during the United States colonial period. Most of the land being logged belonged to the state and, lacking any tenure or sense of ownership, those doing the logging had little incentive to be concerned with long-term conservation issues. The Philippines was a resource to be reaped and harvested. Today, heavy logging continues, legal and illegal, with most of the trees being exported to Japan. Timber produced in the Philippines is so economical that the Japanese timber market is almost nonexistent. (Otsuka and Place, 2001) As the country's population expanded, people have migrated into the cleared upland areas as fast as the trees came down. Presently, 55 % {{of the population of the}} Philippines is located in these environmentally sensitive <b>highlands</b> practicing shifting <b>agriculture.</b> (Early & Headland 1998) This combination of rapid deforestation, population growth and uncontrolled expansion of upland agriculture has resulted in massive soil erosion and land degradation. To complicate maters many of the highland areas most in need of forest protection and other soil saving measures are hideouts of militant anti-government groups. The early Spanish rule and land tenure systems has created an oligarchic system which the Philippines have been unable to shed in its nearly sixty years of independent rule. Unique in its archipelago form, the Philippines represents the only predominately Christian nation in Asia. While a highly literate society it suffers from widespread corruption at all levels of government. In addition its geography of multiple mountainous islands and jungle terrain provide ample hiding places for political revolutionaries which have been part of the Philippines since Spain’s colonization...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the willingness to}} pay (WTP) for the <b>highland</b> <b>agriculture</b> restriction policy which aims to stabilize the water quality in the Han River basin, South Korea. To estimate the WTP, we use a double-bounded contingent valuation method and a random-effects interval-data regression. We extend contingent valuation studies by dealing with the potential preference anomalies (shift, anchoring, and inconsistent response effects). The result indicates that after the preference anomalies are corrected, the statistical precision of parameter estimates is improved. After correcting the potential preference anomalies, estimated welfare gains are on average South Korean currency (KRW) 2, 861 per month per household. Based on the WTP estimate, the total benefits from the land use restriction policy are around KRW 297. 73 billion and the total costs are around KRW 129. 44 billion. The net benefit is, thus, around KRW 168. 29 billion. This study suggests several practical solutions that would be useful for the water management. First, a priority {{should be given to}} the valid compensation for the highland farmers’ expected income loss. Second, it is necessary to increase in the unit cost of the highland purchase. Third, wasted or inefficiently used costs (e. g., overinvestment in waste treatment facilities, and temporary upstream community support) should be transferred to the program associated with high mountainous agriculture field purchase.

All suspended solid that {{carried out by the}} river contain various kind of hazard potential to the environment. U, Th and Pb are the potential hazard elements carried out by water and accumulate at the dam. Approach: Five sampling point were selected where five 30 cm core collected at each sampling point. Each core were sliced at 2 cm and homogenized. 210 Pb in homogenize sliced was determine using Alpha Spectrometry method. Plot of concentration against depth produce vertical distribution profile of the elements. This study will measure the activity of 210 Pb in sediment at Sultan Abu Bakar Dam and measure the concentration of U, Th and Pb using Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) technique. Results: The concentration of 210 Pb, Pb, U and Th was found that there is no obvious distribution pattern was observed in the depth profile.

40|$|The {{growth of}} Thailand’s {{economy and the}} {{transformation}} of its agricultural sector has been remarkably rapid. In many upland and highland areas, the shift from remoteness to market integration, from subsistence to commercialization, has taken place over barely two decades. In spite of increasing land scarcity and ever-higher returns to most agricultural enterprises, however, private investments in soil conservation have lagged far behind the pace of agricultural growth, suggesting that many, if not most, farmers in affected areas are either {{unwilling or unable to}} undertake such investments. To resolve the serious problems of land degradation and erosion requires an understanding of factors that guide and constrain farmers ’ decisions. In this proposal I argue that to gain such an understanding requires the identification both of ‘macro ’ (largely economic and policy) influences as well as ‘micro ’ (predominantly local and institutional) constraints. These two sets of phenomena jointly govern the overall profitability of agriculture and farmers ’ land use and soil conservation decisions, yet their influence and interactions are seldom carefully distinguished or studied in an integrated way. I propose to address this by means of two linked research activities. First, I will obtain econometric estimates of the short and long run impacts of aggregate economic growth and of key policy reforms on resource allocation in upland and <b>highland</b> <b>agriculture.</b> Second, I will use these estimates to evaluate the land use and environmental impacts of economic growth and policy reforms, within an analytical framework integrating local economic and institutional conditions based on data gathered at selected field sites. An important objective of the research will be to be able to propose changes in policy and project design that will lead both to improvement in the overall economic welfare of agricultural communities and to maintenance of the quality of their environmental resource base. 2 Markets, policies and the environment in Thai agriculture: is an environmentally-friendly agricultural transition possible...|$|E
