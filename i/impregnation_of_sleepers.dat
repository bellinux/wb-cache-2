40|$|AbstractBallasted track {{sleepers}} have the important function of providing sufficient lateral resistance {{to prevent the}} lateral movement of rails. If the lateral force induced by the thermal expansion of steel rails overcomes the lateral resistance <b>of</b> <b>sleepers,</b> rail buckling may occur. More {{attention has been paid}} to this problem of lateral stability since the introduction of continuous welded rails. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty in the prediction of the lateral resistance <b>of</b> <b>sleepers.</b> In view <b>of</b> the foregoing, a series of laboratory tests was conducted on 1 / 5 -scale models to evaluate the lateral resistance <b>of</b> <b>sleepers.</b> Single-sleeper pullout tests and track panel pullout tests were conducted on different types <b>of</b> concrete <b>sleepers.</b> The results <b>of</b> the pullout tests revealed the effects <b>of</b> the <b>sleeper</b> shape, the sleeper spacing, and the number <b>of</b> <b>sleepers</b> on the lateral resistance. Based on the model test results, a new numerical method for evaluating the lateral resistance <b>of</b> <b>sleepers</b> is proposed...|$|R

30|$|The <b>impregnation</b> <b>of</b> various simple {{phenolic}} {{and natural}} polycyclic compounds into wood was investigated from the viewpoints of vibrational property and dimensional stabilizing effect. When simple phenolic compounds were impregnated, the loss tangent (tan δ) in the longitudinal direction increased linearly with increasing weight gain. Meanwhile, among the natural polycyclic compounds hematoxylin decreased the tan δ drastically by impregnation. It was {{suggested that the}} five hydroxyl groups and the pyran ring oxygen in the hematoxylin molecule contribute to formation of the crosslinkage-type hydrogen bonds between wood components. The rigidity of hematoxylin molecules may also be important. By <b>impregnation</b> <b>of</b> about 10 % catechol, resorcinol, and saligenin, a 40 % level of antiswelling efficiency (ASE) was attained, although a significant dimensional stabilizing effect was not observed after <b>impregnation</b> <b>of</b> natural polycyclic compounds.|$|R
