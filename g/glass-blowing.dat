500|$|American Window Glass made record {{profits in}} 1920. All of the company's small plants {{had been sold}} or closed by that time. The <b>glass-blowing</b> {{machines}} were still being used to extract molten glass. The company was described as having [...] "six large and well-equipped plants located near the Pittsburgh district, and one large plant at Hartford City, Ind." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1905 American Window Glass sold {{some of its}} smaller plants, {{including}} Hartford City's {{plant number}} 32. [...] Plant number 3 still continued operations. It employed 500 people in 1910. Before the start of World War I, American Window Glass Company was still the dominant window glass manufacturer, accounting [...] for {{over half of the}} nation's window glass manufacturing capacity. [...] In 1913, the company continued to close many of its smaller plants, while the large plants were equipped with the glass blowing machines. Plant number 3 was the third largest window glass factory in the United States, and the largest west of Pennsylvania. [...] The Belgian portion of Hartford City's glassmaking workforce was dramatically reduced because of two factors: [...] the <b>glass-blowing</b> machine replaced human glass blowers; and Belgians had difficulty returning from summer vacations in their European homeland after the start of World War I.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his time}} at Caltech, Beckman was active in {{teaching}} at both the introductory and advanced graduate levels. Beckman shared his expertise in <b>glass-blowing</b> by teaching classes in the machine shop. He also taught classes {{in the design and}} use of research instruments. [...] Beckman dealt first-hand with the chemists' need for good instrumentation as manager of the chemistry department's instrument shop. Beckman's interest in electronics made him very popular within the chemistry department at Caltech, as he was very skilled in building measuring instruments.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the board}} of the National Technical Laboratory was unwilling to support the secret project, whose details they could not be told, they agreed that Beckman was free to follow up on it independently. Beckman set up a second spinoff company, Arnold O. Beckman, Inc., for their manufacture. [...] Creating the oxygen meter was a {{technical}} challenge, involving the creation of tiny, highly precise glass dumbbells. Beckman created a tiny <b>glass-blowing</b> machine which would generate a precisely measured puff of air to create the glass balls.|$|E
2500|$|In 1892, the [...] "Crown Cork Bottle Seal" [...] was {{patented}} by William Painter, a Baltimore, Maryland machine shop operator. It {{was the first}} bottle top to successfully keep the bubbles in the bottle. In 1899, the first patent was issued for a <b>glass-blowing</b> machine for the automatic production of glass bottles. Earlier glass bottles had all been hand-blown. Four years later, the new bottle-blowing machine was in operation. It was first operated by the inventor, Michael Owens, an employee of Libby Glass Company. Within a few years, glass bottle production increased from 1,400 bottles a day to about 58,000 bottles a day.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the centre}} of the [...] long, [...] wide and [...] tall hall was an ornate bronze fountain, given by the Street Commissioners upon their {{retirement}} in 1851. The base was made from Yorkshire sandstone and was [...] in diameter. It was {{in the form of a}} Greek tazza and cost £900. On the inside of the bowl were eight lions' heads from which water was ejected. The entire fountain was [...] tall and in the centre was a [...] tall statue called the Messenger and Sons. The statue consisted of four children representative of each of Birmingham's main four industries; gun making, <b>glass-blowing,</b> bronzing and engineering. The fountain was inaugurated by the Chairman of the Market Committee, John Cadbury, on 24 December 1851. The fountain was removed in 1880 with the intention of re-erecting it in Highgate Park later that year but this did not happen and it was destroyed in 1923.|$|E
2500|$|The School {{moved to}} {{premises}} on Monks Road in 1886, where it became one-half of a 'School of Science and Art', {{with its own}} principal and organising committee. [...] The ground floor was home to the Science School (except for the Modelling Room), with shared use of the Lecture Theatre and the Porters' Room, while the Art School {{was based on the}} first floor, with shared use of the Committee and Secretary's Rooms. [...] Both floors had rooms for the respective schools' masters. [...] The Basement had two bedrooms and a living room, and was shared use, except that the Science School used the Laboratory and Balance Room. [...] The Science School increased in size and added a technical wing to the Monks Road premises in 1891, a reflection of the rise of industry in Lincoln in general, which was further demonstrated in an article from the Lincoln Gazette, dated 1897, which described a conversazione at the combined school in 1897, during which x-rays, <b>glass-blowing,</b> and a cinematograph were exhibited. [...] Of twelve paragraphs, only one is devoted to the art school. [...] In 1901 the combined school was renamed the City of Lincoln Municipal Technical School, and then the Lincoln Technical College in 1928.|$|E

6000|$|The {{lower the}} {{employment}} in the industrial scale, the harder the conditions. The finer, the more delicate, the more skilled the trade, the higher is it lifted above the struggle. There is less pressure, less sordidness, less savagery. There are fewer glass-blowers proportionate {{to the needs of}} the <b>glass-blowing</b> industry than there are ditch-diggers proportionate {{to the needs of the}} ditch-digging industry. And not only this, for it requires a glass-blower to take the place of a striking glass-blower, while any kind of a striker or out-of-work can take the place of a ditch-digger. So the skilled trades are more independent, have more individuality and latitude. They may confer with their masters, make demands, assert themselves. The unskilled laborers, on the other hand, have no voice in their affairs. The settlement of terms is none of their business. [...] "Free contract" [...] is all that remains to them. They may take what is offered, or leave it. There are plenty more of their kind. They do not count. They are members of the surplus labor army, and must be content with a hand-to-mouth existence.|$|E
