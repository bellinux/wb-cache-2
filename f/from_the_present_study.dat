40|$|Azumamide E, a cyclotetrapeptide {{isolated}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sponge Mycale izuensis, is {{the most}} powerful carboxylic acid containing natural histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor known to date. In this paper, we describe design and synthesis of two stereochemical variants of the natural product. These compounds have allowed us to clarify the influence of side chain topology on the HDAC-inhibitory activity. <b>The</b> <b>present</b> contribution also reveals the identity of the recognition pattern between azumamides and the histone deacetylase-like protein (HDLP) model receptor and reports the azumamide E unprecedented isoform selectivity on histone deacetylases class subtypes. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>studies,</b> a plausible model for the interaction of azumamides with the receptor binding pocket is derived, providing a framework for the rational design of new cyclotetrapeptide-based HDAC inhibitors as antitumor agents...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{anticoccidial}} {{activity of}} the ionophore CP- 82, 009 against laboratory isolates of four major species of poultry Eimeria was investigated. Parameters of anticoccidial efficacy that were evaluated were control of lesions and weight suppression. At 4 and 5 ppm, CP- 82, 009 demonstrated broad-spectrum anticoccidial efficacy in battery trials that was equivalent to reference commercial ionophores. When CP- 82, 009 was fed to uninfected broiler chickens at efficacious dose levels, growth rate and feed efficiency {{were found to be}} equivalent to commercial agents over a 21 -day period in batteries and over a 49 -day period in floor pens. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>studies,</b> it appears that CP- 82, 009 is an efficacious anticoccidial that is well tolerated by chickens, and that it ranks among the most potent anticoccidial ionophores described to date...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To examine {{morphological}} and biochemical {{characteristics of}} commonly available accessions of Centellaasiatica in Malaysia. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Four accessions of Pegaga designated as UPM 01, UPM 02, UPM 03 and UPM 04 were collected throughout Malaysia and their morphological characteristics and biochemical contents were investigated. Flavonoid profiling {{was carried out}} using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Findings: Accession UPM 02 had highest total soluble glucose content with 75. 4 mg/g, where lowest in UPM 03 39. 1 mg/g. Among the four accessions, β-carotene content ranged from 2. 11 mg/g to 3. 3 mg/g. For flavonoid content, UPM 03 had the highest concentration of 8. 99 mg/g. <b>The</b> flavonoids <b>present</b> in UPM 03 were quercetin, kaempherol, luteolin and rutin while others only had rutin or/and kaempherol.

40|$|The rate of {{commitment}} of bacterial spores to germinate after short exposure to L-alanine increases exponentially <b>from</b> <b>the</b> time of addition of L-alanine. This absence of a lag facilitates kinetic analysis and allows the dependence {{of commitment}} on temperature and pH to be determined. The pH profile of commitment has been compared with that obtained from measurements of absorbance decreases during germination, and the two profiles exhibit differing pK values. It is suggested that because the decrease in A 600 of spore suspensions is a late event in germination, it is an unsuitable parameter for studying germination-triggering reactions. Commitment {{has been shown to}} be temperature-dependent, with an optimum at approx. 37 degrees C and an activation energy (mu) of 1. 08 X 10 (5) J/mol. <b>The</b> data obtained <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>studies</b> have been used to develop a model for the triggering of germination...|$|R

30|$|It is {{concluded}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study</b> {{that there}} are four quasi wave propagates in of generalized thermoelastic micropolar transversely isotropic medium viz., quasi-longitudinal displacement (qLD) wave, quasi-transverse displacement (qTD) wave, quasi- transverse microrotational (qTM) wave and quasi thermal (qT) waves.|$|E
40|$|Oxidative {{cyclization}} of 1, 1 `-binaphthyl (1) to perylene (2) can {{be achieved}} in essentially quantitative yield {{by the action of}} three or more equivalents of potassium metal in hot tetrahydrofuran. An overall reaction mechanism is proposed that accounts for all of the experimental observations reported by previous investigators and those <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>studies.</b> <b>The</b> trans- 6 a, 6 b-dihydroperylene dianion (6 (2 -)) is believed lobe <b>the</b> pivotal intermediate <b>from</b> which H- 2, is lost. A radical chain reaction involving free hydrogen atoms (H-center dot) in the two-step propagation cycle is proposed to explain the formation of H- 2 from 6 (2 -). Anionic cyclodehydrogenations of this sort are complementary to those performed under strongly acidic/oxidizing conditions, photochemically, or thermally (flash vacuum pyrolysis), and {{a better understanding of how}} they occur, together with the optimized synthetic protocol reported here, should encourage their wider use in organic synthesis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{experiments}} {{are carried out}} to study the effect of different levels of over expansion on base pressure in a suddenly expanded axi-symmetric duct. Accordingly the {{experiments are}} conducted at two different levels of Over Expansions (I. e. Pe/Pa = 0. 277 and 0. 56). The area ratio of <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study</b> is 3. 24. The jet Mach numbers at the entry to the suddenly expanded duct, studied are 2. 2 and 2. 58. The length-to-diameter ratio of the suddenly expanded duct is varied from 10 to 1. Active control {{in the form of}} four micro jets of 1 mm orifice diameter located at 90 0 intervals along a pitch circle diameter of 1. 3 times the nozzle exit diameter in the base region are employed.

40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) is a complex, degenerative and progressive disease involving the multiple genetic and environmental fac-tors {{that can result}} in severe visual loss. The etiology of AMD is not well understood. Many theories exist and feature mechanisms of oxidative stress, atherosclerotic-like changes, genetic predisposition and infl ammation. The most recent clinical studies appointed to a great role of infl ammation and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the pathogenesis of AMD. There is {{a large body of}} evidence indicating the association of CRP with endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as with lipid status disorder in AMD patients. According to recent studies, CRP is defi nitely not only the infl ammatory marker but also a mediator of development of the vascular disorders in the retinal circulation. <b>The</b> results obtained <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>studies</b> may help our understanding the pathogenesis of the retinal vascular disease associated with high levels of CRP.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} use of early MRI in {{prognosis}} and diagnosis in patients presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) characteristic of demyelination. This has been investigated in a cohort recruited within 3 months of CIS onset between 1995 and 2004 and followed up clinically and with MRI (planned at 3 months, 1, 3 and 5 years). Current MRI criteria are highly specific {{for the development of}} clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) but have limited sensitivity and are complex. <b>Presented</b> is <b>the</b> evaluation of simplified MRI criteria in my London CIS cohort and in a multicentre CIS cohort. Results <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> <b>studies</b> show that <b>the</b> MRI criteria can be simplified (dissemination in space: 2 or more lesions in separate but characteristic locations, dissemination in time: an early new T 2 lesion) and still maintain high specificity, with improved sensitivity and accuracy.
