500|$|Brandon Tartikoff, {{one of the}} show's producers, {{felt that}} Fox was too short in {{relation}} to the actors playing his parents, and tried to have him replaced. Tartikoff reportedly said that [...] "this {{is not the kind of}} face you'll ever find on a lunch-box." [...] After his later successes, Fox presented Tartikoff with a custom-made lunch-box with the inscription [...] "To Brandon, this <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> put your crow in. Love and Kisses, Michael J. Fox." [...] Tartikoff kept the lunch-box in his office for the rest of his NBC career.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{told the}} United States Secret Service he rented the Hyatt hotel room at Adolf's request {{and that he}} {{believed}} [...] "without a doubt" [...] that Adolf came to Denver to kill Obama. According to a police affidavit, [...] "Johnson said the only reason for such killing would be because Obama is black." [...] During an August 25 interview with KCNC-TV, a CBS owned-and-operated television station in Denver, Johnson first denied being personally involved with the plot and, when asked whether he felt the men had serious plans {{to go through with}} the assassination, he said, [...] "Looking back at it, I don't want to say yes, but I don't want to say no." [...] Eventually, however, he admitted the other two men had planned a killing when he said, [...] "Yeah, they were here to do that, to assassinate him ... it's about as hard for me to swallow as it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> understand." [...] Johnson said the plan was for Adolf to, [...] "shoot Obama from a high vantage point using a [...] sighted at 750 yards". Johnson said the shooting was to take place during Obama's acceptance speech on August 28 at the Democratic National Convention in INVESCO Field at Mile High. Johnson told the station, [...] "He don't belong in political office. Blacks don't belong in political office. He ought to be shot." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1860s Maykov became {{intrigued}} by The Tale of Igor's Campaign, which {{his son was}} studying in gymnasium at the time. Baffled by the vagueness and occasional incongruity of all the available translations, he shared his doubts with professor Izmail Streznevsky, who replied: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> sort these things out." [...] Maykov later described the four years of work on the new translation that followed as his [...] "second university". His major objective was {{to come up with}} undeniable proof of the authenticity of the old text, something that many authors, Ivan Goncharov among them, expressed doubts about. Ignoring Dostoyevsky's advice to use rhymes so as to make the text sound more modern, Maykov provided the first ever scientifically substantiated translation of the document, supplied with comprehensive commentaries. First published in the January 1870 issue of Zarya magazine, it is still {{regarded as one of the}} finest achievements of his career.|$|E

2500|$|Blackman {{is adamant}} that musicality {{has nothing to}} do with gender. [...] "The gender {{question}} is not even worth bringing up because the drums have got nothing to do with gender", Blackman says. [...] "I'm there because I love to play music. And I'm in support of anyone who wants to play the instrument. I wouldn't care if Art Blakey was pink with polka dots and wearing a tutu. I wouldn't care if Tony Williams was green." [...] "There are people who have opinions about whatever and whoever, in terms of gender, in terms of race and weight, hairstyle, religion", says Blackman. [...] "But to me, your personality influences what you play and what you do, but everything else <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> develop and to nourish and to take further, and that's where I'm at. In terms of my goals, me being a female drummer has nothing to with anything except for the fact that I wear bras and panties and guys don't." ...|$|E
