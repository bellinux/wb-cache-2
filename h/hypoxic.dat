5|$|At night, {{the shallow}} reef {{platforms}} inhabited by the epaulette shark often become {{isolated from the}} ocean by the receding tide. The amount of dissolved oxygen in the pool can drop 80% or more overnight from the combined respiration of all the organisms within the pool. The epaulette shark has evolved to cope with these <b>hypoxic</b> conditions, being able to survive for over three hours in 5% of the atmospheric O2 level without losing behavioral responsiveness. In the laboratory, epaulette sharks have survived for an hour without any oxygen at 30°C (86°F), which is also unusual in that most animals capable of tolerating oxygen deprivation do so at low temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Low oxygen levels lead to <b>hypoxic</b> {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction, the {{tightening of}} small {{blood vessels in}} the lung to create an optimal distribution of blood through the lung. Persistently low oxygen levels causing chronic vasoconstriction leads to increased pressure on the pulmonary artery (pulmonary hypertension), which in turn puts strain on the right ventricle, the part of the heart that pumps blood to the lungs. The right ventricle undergoes remodeling, becomes distended and is less able to remove blood from the veins. When this is the case, raised hydrostatic pressure leads to accumulation of fluid in the skin (edema), and in more severe cases the liver and the abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} was {{not observed}} before World War II, but with the availability of supplemental oxygen in the decade following, it rapidly {{became one of the}} principal causes of infant blindness in developed countries. By 1960 the use of oxygen had become identified as a risk factor and its administration restricted. The resulting fall in retinopathy of prematurity was accompanied by a rise in infant mortality and hypoxia-related complications. Since then, more sophisticated monitoring and diagnosis have established protocols for oxygen use which aim to balance between <b>hypoxic</b> conditions and problems of retinopathy of prematurity.|$|E
5|$|A {{blood vessel}} leads {{up the middle}} of the body from the stomach to a {{circular}} vessel {{at the base of the}} lophophore, and from there a single blind vessel runs up each tentacle. A pair of blood vessels near the body wall lead downward from the lophophore ring to the stomach and also to blind branches throughout the body. There is no heart, but the major vessels can contract in waves to move the blood. Phoronids do not ventilate their trunks with oxygenated water, but rely on respiration through the lophophore. The blood contains hemoglobin, which is unusual in such small animals and seems to be an adaptation to anoxic and <b>hypoxic</b> environments. The blood of Phoronis architecta carries twice as much oxygen as a human of the same weight. Two metanephridia filter the body fluid, returning any useful products and dumping the remaining soluble wastes through a pair of pores beside the anus.|$|E
5|$|Hemoglobin is a tetramer {{with four}} oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon {{monoxide}} {{at one of these}} sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes <b>hypoxic</b> tissue injury. Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.|$|E
5|$|The {{physiological}} {{responses of the}} epaulette shark to low oxygen are mediated by the nucleoside adenosine. In <b>hypoxic</b> conditions, the heart and ventilation rates drop sharply. The shark's blood pressure falls by half as the blood vessels dilate to deliver more blood to the brain and heart. Unlike in bony fishes and tetrapods, the blood flow rate remains constant {{and there is no}} elevation of blood glucose levels. The brains of sharks only consume a third as much ATP as those of teleosts. The epaulette shark is able to lower this energy demand further by reducing the metabolism of certain areas of its brain, e.g. keeping the sensory nuclei functional while deactivating the motor nuclei. This allows the shark to supply enough ATP to prevent neuron death, while still remaining alert to its environment.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is not {{toxic to}} {{all forms of}} life. Its harmful effects are due to binding with hemoglobin so its danger to organisms that do not use this compound is doubtful. It thus {{has no effect on}} photosynthesising plants. It is easily absorbed through the lungs. Inhaling the gas can lead to <b>hypoxic</b> injury, nervous system damage, and even death. Different people and populations may have different carbon monoxide tolerance levels. On average, exposures at 100 ppm or greater is dangerous to human health. In the United States, the OSHA limits long-term workplace exposure levels to less than 50 ppm averaged over an 8-hour period; in addition, employees are to be removed from any confined space if an upper limit ("ceiling") of 100 ppm is reached. Carbon monoxide exposure may lead to a significantly shorter life span due to heart damage. The carbon monoxide tolerance level for any person is altered by several factors, including activity level, rate of ventilation, a pre-existing cerebral or cardiovascular disease, cardiac output, anemia, sickle cell disease and other hematological disorders, barometric pressure, and metabolic rate.|$|E
25|$|The bottom gas may be <b>hypoxic</b> and {{unsuitable}} for breathing at the surface. A travel gas {{may be used}} to transit the <b>hypoxic</b> range. It may be possible to use one of the decompression mixtures as a travel gas, which would reduce the number of cylinders carried.|$|E
25|$|Enhanced calpain activity, {{regulated}} by CAPNS1, significantly contributes to platelet hyperreactivity under <b>hypoxic</b> environment.|$|E
25|$|Automaticity is {{a measure}} of the {{propensity}} of a fiber to initiate an impulse spontaneously. The product of a <b>hypoxic</b> myocardium can be hyperirritable myocardial cells. These may then act as pacemakers. The ventricles are then being stimulated by more than one pacemaker. Scar and dying tissue is inexcitable, but around these areas usually lies a penumbra of <b>hypoxic</b> tissue that is excitable. Ventricular excitability may generate re-entry ventricular arrhythmia.|$|E
25|$|Breath-hold {{duration}} {{is limited}} by oxygen reserves, {{and the risk of}} <b>hypoxic</b> blackout, which has a high associated risk of drowning.|$|E
25|$|Demosponges {{maintained}} under laboratory {{conditions can}} also tolerate <b>hypoxic</b> conditions, for brief periods, which could reflect their adaptability to dissolved oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Heliair {{will always}} have less than 21% oxygen, and will be <b>hypoxic</b> (less than 17% oxygen) for mixes with more than 20% helium.|$|E
25|$|Human spleens {{have been}} noted to {{decrease}} in volume up to 40% when subjected to stimuli from strenuous exercise or <b>hypoxic</b> gas inhalation.|$|E
25|$|Technical diver {{training}} and certification agencies may differentiate between levels of trimix diving qualifications, The usual distinction is between normoxic trimix and <b>hypoxic</b> trimix, sometimes also called full trimix.|$|E
25|$|The CDC has {{identified}} a consistent set of voluntary behaviors associated with unintentional drowning, and calls them dangerous underwater breath-holding behaviors. These are intentional hyperventilation, static apnea and <b>hypoxic</b> training.|$|E
25|$|The World Resources Institute has {{identified}} 375 <b>hypoxic</b> coastal zones in the world, concentrated in coastal areas in Western Europe, the Eastern and Southern coasts of the US, and East Asia, particularly Japan.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{exhibit a}} wide range of tactics to {{counteract}} aquatic hypoxia, but when escape from the <b>hypoxic</b> stress is not possible, maintaining oxygen extraction and delivery becomes an essential component to survival. Except for the Antarctic ice fish that does not, most fish use hemoglobin (Hb) within their red blood cells to bind chemically and deliver 95% of the oxygen extracted from the environment to the working tissues. Maintaining oxygen extraction and delivery to the tissues allows continued activity under <b>hypoxic</b> stress and is in part determined by modifications in two different blood parameters: hematocrit and the binding properties of hemoglobin.|$|E
25|$|The lower-energy production, per glucose, of {{anaerobic}} respiration relative to aerobic respiration, results in greater flux through the pathway under <b>hypoxic</b> (low-oxygen) conditions, unless {{alternative sources of}} anaerobically oxidizable substrates, such as fatty acids, are found.|$|E
25|$|Other divers {{question}} whether this proliferation of terminology is useful, {{and feel that}} the term Trimix is sufficient, modified as appropriate with the terms <b>hypoxic,</b> normoxic and hyperoxic, and the usual forms for indicating constituent gas fraction.|$|E
25|$|Other {{rivers in}} Australia may {{experience}} infrequent 'blackwater events' associated with flood waters connecting to forested floodplains and these events {{may be associated}} with <b>hypoxic</b> waters. Examples include the Murray River, Edward River, Wakool River and Murrumbidgee River.|$|E
25|$|Hypoxic: {{where the}} oxygen content {{is less than}} that of air, {{generally}} to the extent that there is a significant risk of measurable physiological effect over the short term. The immediate risk is usually <b>hypoxic</b> incapacitation at or near the surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{sudden and}} {{unexpected}} {{death of a}} swimmer, with no involuntary drowning sequence, {{can be difficult to}} ascribe to a specific cause. The possibilities may include pre-existing organic cardiac disease, pre-existing cardiac electrical abnormalities, epilepsy, <b>hypoxic</b> blackout, homicide and suicide. The diagnosis may have significant legal consequences.|$|E
25|$|Neurogenic/central DI {{results from}} a lack of ADH; {{occasionally}} it can present with decreased thirst as regulation of thirst and ADH production occur in close proximity in the hypothalamus. It is encountered as a result of <b>hypoxic</b> encephalopathy, neurosurgery, autoimmunity or cancer, or sometimes without an underlying cause (idiopathic).|$|E
25|$|Preparing fetal neurons for delivery: Crossing the placenta, {{maternal}} oxytocin {{reaches the}} fetal brain and induces a switch {{in the action}} of neurotransmitter GABA from excitatory to inhibitory on fetal cortical neurons. This silences the fetal brain {{for the period of}} delivery and reduces its vulnerability to <b>hypoxic</b> damage.|$|E
25|$|To {{deal with}} {{decreased}} ATP production through the electron transport chain, fish must activate anaerobic means of energy production (see anaerobic metabolism) while suppressing metabolic demands. The ability to decrease energy demand by metabolic suppression {{is essential to}} ensure <b>hypoxic</b> survival due to the limited efficiency of anaerobic ATP production.|$|E
25|$|These gas mixes {{can also}} lower {{the level of}} oxygen in the mix to reduce the danger of oxygen toxicity. Once the oxygen is reduced below about 18% the mix {{is known as a}} <b>hypoxic</b> mix as it does not contain enough oxygen to be used safely at the surface.|$|E
25|$|CP {{in general}} is a non-progressive, {{neurological}} condition that results from brain injury and malformation occurring before cerebral development is complete. ADCP is associated with injury and malformations to the extrapyramidal tracts in the basal ganglia or the cerebellum. Lesions to this region principally arise via <b>hypoxic</b> ischemic brain injury (HIBI) or bilirubin encephalopathy.|$|E
25|$|PEDF {{expression}} is upregulated by plasminogen kringle domains 1-4 (also known as angiostatin) and the kringle 5 (K5) domain. Hypoxia, or low oxygen conditions, {{leads to the}} downregulation of PEDF. This effect is due to <b>hypoxic</b> conditions causing matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to proteolytically degrade PEDF. In addition, amyloid beta {{has been shown to}} decrease PEDF mRNA levels.|$|E
25|$|DMSO {{disposed}} into sewers {{can also}} cause odor problems in municipal effluents: waste water bacteria transform DMSO under <b>hypoxic</b> (anoxic) conditions into dimethyl sulfide (DMS) that has a strong disagreeable odor, similar to rotten cabbage. However, chemically pure DMSO is odorless {{because of the lack}} of C-S-C (sulfide) and C-S-H (mercaptan) linkages. Deodorization of DMSO is achieved by removing the odorous impurities it contains.|$|E
25|$|This process {{occurs in}} the {{bacteria}} involved in making yogurt (the lactic acid causes the milk to curdle). This process also occurs in animals under <b>hypoxic</b> (or partially anaerobic) conditions, found, for example, in overworked muscles that are starved of oxygen. In many tissues, this is a cellular last resort for energy; most animal tissue cannot tolerate anaerobic conditions {{for an extended period}} of time.|$|E
25|$|Surface {{runoff from}} farming, {{as well as}} urban runoff and runoff from the {{construction}} of roads, buildings, ports, channels, and harbours, can carry soil and particles laden with carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and minerals. This nutrient-rich water can cause fleshy algae and phytoplankton to thrive in coastal areas; known as algal blooms, which {{have the potential to}} create <b>hypoxic</b> conditions by using all available oxygen.|$|E
25|$|H. littorale has {{two types}} of {{hemoglobin}}, anodic and cathodic; anodic hemoglobin has a relatively low oxygen affinity and has marked Bohr effects, while cathodic hemoglobin lack significant pH effects. In H. littorale, cathodic hemoglobin has a pronounced reversed Bohr effect in which oxygen affinity increases with decreased pH. Cathodic hemoglobin has the purpose of safeguarding oxygen transport to tissues under <b>hypoxic</b> and acidotic conditions.|$|E
25|$|Aquatic mammals seldom dive {{beyond their}} aerobic diving limit, which {{is related to}} the {{myoglobin}} oxygen stored. The muscle mass of aquatic mammals is relatively large, so the high myoglobin content of their skeletal muscles provides a large reserve. Myoglobin-bound oxygen is only released in relatively <b>hypoxic</b> muscle tissue, so the peripheral vasoconstriction due to the diving reflex makes the muscles ischaemic and promotes early use of myoglobin bound oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Another {{strategy}} is to use anaerobic bacteria that have been transformed with an enzyme that can convert a non-toxic prodrug into a toxic drug. With the proliferation of the bacteria in the necrotic and <b>hypoxic</b> areas of the tumor, the enzyme is expressed solely in the tumor. Thus, a systemically applied prodrug is metabolised to the toxic drug only in the tumor. This has been demonstrated to be effective with the nonpathogenic anaerobe Clostridium sporogenes.|$|E
25|$|Cancer {{cells with}} {{properties}} similar to stem cells {{have been found}} in glioblastomas (this may be a cause of their resistance to conventional treatments, and high recurrence rate). These so-called glioblastoma stem-like cells reside in a niche around arterioles, which protects these cells against therapy by maintaining a relatively <b>hypoxic</b> environment. A biomarker for cells in glioblastomas that exhibit cancer stem cell properties, the transcription factor Hes3, has been shown to regulate their number when placed in culture.|$|E
