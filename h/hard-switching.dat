This base design is supplemented by a snubber circuit consisting of a few passive components.

40|$|A {{study of}} the Auxiliary Resonant Commutated Pole (ARCP) {{converter}} and a comparison with standard <b>hard-switched</b> inverters is presented. A thorough description of the AELCP circuit topology is made with three switching scenarios discussed: commutation from a diode, commutation from a switch with low current, and commutation from a switch with high current. The efficiency of the ARCP inverter is attributed {{to the fact that}} switching losses are eliminated by switching under zero voltage or zero current conditions. To accomplish this task, addition circuitry is introduced which colntributes to additional conduction losses. An example H-bridge is presented using both ARCP phase legs and <b>hard-switched</b> phase legs. Losses for each case are calculated and a comparison is made. From simulations, it is shown that the additional conduction losses introduced by the ARCP circuit are small in comparison with the switching losses found in a standard <b>hard-switched</b> circuit.

40|$|The {{dead-time}} effect, as {{an intrinsic}} {{problem of the}} converters based on the half-bridge unit, leads to distortions in the converter output. Although several dead-time effect compensation or elimination methods have been proposed, they cannot fully remove the dead-time effect of blanking delay error, because the output current polarity is difficult detect accurately. This paper utilizes the zero-voltage-switching (ZVT) technique to eliminate the blanking delay error, which is {{the main drawback of}} the <b>hard-switching</b> inverter, although the technique initially aims to improve the efficiency. A typical ZVT inverter—the auxiliary resonant snubber inverter (ARSI) is analyzed. The blanking delay error is completely eliminated in the ARSI. Another error source caused by the finite rise- and fall-times of the voltage is analyzed, which was not considered in the <b>hard-switching</b> inverter. A compensation method based on the voltage error estimation is proposed to compensate the rise- and fall-error. A prototype was developed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control. Both the simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the qualities of the output current and voltage in the ARSI are better than that in the <b>hard-switching</b> inverter due to the elimination of the blanking delay error.

The advantages and disadvantages of resonant converters over non- resonant, or <b>hard-switched</b> converters, are investigated. Basic ARCP circuit operation is modeled, with emphasis placed on examining the commutation between high and low voltage states. Detailed ARCP converter operation is modeled in software and compared to a software model of a <b>hard-switched</b> converter.

40|$|In <b>hard-switched</b> converters, the {{switching}} frequency {{is limited by}} switching losses and EMI problems. However, high-{{switching frequency}} is necessary to reduce the converter size. Hence, soft switching is imperat ve at high switching frequency to obtain good efficiency. Push–pull converter is a preferred topology at medium power level. This paper proposes a novel resonant transition topology for push–pull cnverter. The proposed topology uses two additional switches and two diodes when compared to hard-swi ched push–pull converter. These extra switches introduce freewheeling in the primary circuit and thus enable loss-l ss switching. In classical push – ll converters, the transformer primary is left open during two sub-intervals in a period making the turn-on of the switch hard. The new circuit topology converts these open circuit intervals into freewheeling ones.
