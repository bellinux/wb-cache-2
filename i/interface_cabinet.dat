50|$|A {{multi-service}} {{access node}} (MSAN), {{also known as}} a multi-service access gateway (MSAG), is a device typically installed in a telephone exchange (although sometimes in a roadside serving area <b>interface</b> <b>cabinet)</b> which connects customers' telephone lines to the core network, to provide telephone, ISDN, and broadband such as DSL all from a single platform.|$|E
5000|$|Transmitter/receiver building: The antenna {{elements}} are {{mounted on the}} inclined faces of the transmitter/receiver building. and within the structure is {{the remainder of the}} radar, computer, and crew operations equipment. By 2012, the computer room had 2 [...] "IBM ES-9000 mainframe computers, two RADAR and <b>Interface</b> Control Equipment <b>cabinets,</b> and two SunSparc workstations." [...] In the squadron Mission Operations Center, [...] "personnel use a screen with space objects assigned numbers, similar to an air traffic control screen." [...] An attached garage is on the building's east side.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} basic signing {{technologies}} {{available to the}} traffic engineer for dynamically changing sign displays. An example installation of dynamic lane assignment in Houston, TX is reviewed and referenced as the motivation for developing a simple traffic signal <b>cabinet</b> <b>interface</b> for dynamic lane assignment signs. The failure modes of these dynamic lane assignment signs are identified so that suitable control models can be selected. Various candidate control architectures are summarized and a distributed control model is recommended due to the simple cabinet retrofit and the inherent malfunction management capabilities. The paper concludes by describing the distributed computing design comprised of: the sign control interface (SCI) residing in the cabinet and the sign control modules (SCM) residing in each sign. Photographs of the SCI and SCM prototypes are included...|$|R
50|$|A {{pair gain system}} {{consists}} of concentrators or multiplexers which combine the separate signals into a single signal which is transmitted through the existing copper cable pair. The signals are then separated into individual subscriber lines at the customer premises. The pair gain unit which performs the multiplexing can simply provide a second telephone connection over a single subscriber line (called an Analog Multi-Line Carrier or AML) in circumstances where a customer wants to add a new phone line for a fax machine or dial-up internet connection. A larger analog pair gain system made by Anaconda in the 1960s provided seven lines. Some pair gain units can expand the number of subscriber lines available over a single copper pair {{to as many as}} sixty. Large pair gain units are stored in serving area <b>interfaces</b> or metal <b>cabinets</b> typically resembling small apartment-sized refrigerators alongside or near roadways that overlie communications rights-of-way.|$|R
