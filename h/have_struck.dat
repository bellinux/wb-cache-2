5|$|August 25, 1885: A tornado {{passed through}} the towns of Bloomfield and Windsor, {{crossing}} the Connecticut River before dissipating. Nearly the entire tobacco crop in the area was destroyed, at a loss in the millions of dollars. Another tornado may <b>have</b> <b>struck</b> East Hartford a few weeks earlier.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} nearly {{struck the}} Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu.

5|$|As {{the half}} eagle {{approximated}} {{the size of}} a number of foreign gold coins, such as the British guinea and the French louis d'or, it was accepted readily in international commerce and was of a suitable value for many business transactions. DeSaussure is believed to <b>have</b> <b>struck</b> half eagles first for that reason, after consultation with bank officials. The eagle lacked such equivalents, was too high in value for many transactions, and rapidly became unpopular.|$|E
5|$|Leg before wicket (lbw) {{is one of}} {{the ways}} in which a batsman can be {{dismissed}} in the sport of cricket. Following an appeal by the fielding side, the umpire may rule a batsman out lbw if the ball would <b>have</b> <b>struck</b> the wicket, but was instead intercepted by any part of the batsman's body (except the hand holding the bat). The umpire's decision will depend on a number of criteria, including where the ball pitched, whether the ball hit in line with the wickets, and whether the batsman was attempting to hit the ball.|$|E
5|$|Of the 26players {{eligible}} for the Baseball Hall of Fame who <b>have</b> <b>struck</b> out four batters in an inning, four have been elected and two were elected on the first ballot. Players are {{eligible for}} the Hall of Fame if they have played in at least 10major league seasons, and have either been retired for five seasons or deceased {{for at least six}} months. These requirements leave 26players ineligible who are active, four who are living and have played in the past five seasons, and fourteen who did not play in 10 major league seasons.|$|E

5|$|Shingouz {{have a high}} alcohol {{tolerance}} and preference for strong alcoholic beverages, which they consume in large quantities. The Shingouz society is capitalist to the extreme. Shingouz want a profit from everything they do. They are especially adept in trading important and sensitive information to interested parties. Valérian and Laureline <b>have</b> <b>struck</b> up {{a relationship with a}} group of three Shingouz who have a particularly useful network of contacts in all the major space communities. They are especially fond of Laureline, which she often uses to her advantage in striking favourable deals with them.|$|E
5|$|Of {{all of the}} Category5 Pacific hurricanes, {{the only}} ones to make {{landfall}} at any intensity were Hurricane Kenna, Hurricane Rick, and Hurricane Patricia. None made landfall as Category5 hurricanes; Patricia and Kenna had weakened to Category4 {{at the time of their}} landfalls, and Rick was a tropical storm at its landfall. Patricia was the strongest landfall among Pacific hurricanes; 1976's Hurricane Madeline and 1992's Hurricane Iniki are tied as the second strongest storms at landfall, both of which didn't reach Category5 strength, but made landfall as stronger Category 4 storms than Kenna. Originally, a hurricane in 1959 was thought to <b>have</b> <b>struck</b> Manzanillo at Category5 intensity, but a reanalysis in 2016 indicated the storm had peaked as a Category4 hurricane, and made landfall with the same winds as Kenna. Patricia was also originally thought to have made landfall as a Category5 hurricane near Manzanillo before post-season analysis in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Shevchenko {{came close}} to scoring Chelsea’s third goal of the match, but his effort hit the crossbar. Seven minutes of {{stoppage}} time {{were added to the}} match due to Terry’s injury. A tussle between Touré and Mikel over shirt pulling resulted in a fracas between both sets of players. Both managers came onto the pitch in order to calm matters. Referee Howard Webb decided to send off Touré and Mikel for violent conduct and consulted with an assistant referee, before sending off Adebayor, who was alleged to <b>have</b> <b>struck</b> Bridge. Adebayor was irate and needed to be escorted off the field by Arsenal officials. The match restarted, by which point Kalou came on for Shevchenko.|$|E

5|$|The crisis flared again {{two years}} later when the Canadian {{military}} called for overseas reinforcements. Ralston wanted King to impose conscription, but at Macdonald's urging, seemed willing to compromise by going along with the prime minister's plan for one last voluntary recruitment campaign. King however, suddenly dismissed Ralston during a cabinet meeting on November 1, 1944. Macdonald considered resigning, but said later he would <b>have</b> <b>struck</b> King if he had risen to leave. Instead {{he sat in his}} chair ripping sheets of notepaper into small shreds and dropping them on the floor. Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald's decision not to resign probably saved the King government. King himself seemed to recognize that if Macdonald had left, Ilsley would have resigned too, possibly taking other ministers with him and causing the government's collapse.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{hunted for}} German {{commerce}} raiders {{until she was}} transferred to the Grand Fleet at the end of 1914. She was assigned to the 7th Cruiser Squadron upon her return home. She {{was transferred to the}} 2nd Cruiser Squadron in 1916 and was present at the Battle of Jutland. Several days later she was sailing to Russia, carrying the Secretary of State for War, Field Marshal Lord Kitchener, when she is believed to <b>have</b> <b>struck</b> a mine laid by a German submarine. She sank with heavy loss of life, including Kitchener and his staff. Rumours later circulated of German spies and sabotage being involved in the sinking. Her wreck is listed under the Protection of Military Remains Act, though part was later illegally salvaged. Several films have been made exploring the circumstances of her loss.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} from the Mana Tower, the hero discovers that three mysterious pillars of light <b>have</b> <b>struck</b> in the lands of Topple, Jadd, and Lorimar. After being asked by {{the leaders of the}} village, the hero investigates these places and finds dungeons full of monsters with a huge monster at the end. After these three tasks are completed, the mysterious man appears once again, identifying himself as the Mana Lord. He steals the Sword of Mana and causes a large storm in the land of Wendel. The hero journeys there to stop the Mana Storm by confronting the Mana Lord. When the Mana Lord is about to kill the hero, a group of gems appear around the hero to prevent his attack. The Mana Lord then decides to kidnap Tess and vanishes.|$|E

5|$|After 830, Egbert had {{followed}} {{a policy of}} maintaining good relations with Mercia, and this was continued by Æthelwulf when he became king. London was traditionally a Mercian town, but in the 830s it was under West Saxon control; soon after Æthelwulf's accession it reverted to Mercian control. King Wiglaf of Mercia died in 839 and his successor, Berhtwulf, revived the Mercian mint in London; the two kingdoms appear to <b>have</b> <b>struck</b> a joint issue in the mid-840s, possibly indicating West Saxon help in reviving Mercian coinage, and showing the friendly {{relations between the two}} powers. Berkshire was still Mercian in 844, but by 849 it was part of Wessex, as Alfred was born in that year at the West Saxon royal estate in Wantage, then in Berkshire. However, the local Mercian ealdorman, also called Æthelwulf, retained his position under the West Saxon kings. Berhtwulf died in 852 and cooperation with Wessex continued under Burgred, his successor as King of Mercia, who married Æthelwulf's daughter Æthelswith in 853. In the same year Æthelwulf assisted Burgred in a successful attack on Wales to restore the traditional Mercian hegemony over the Welsh.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{week after}} Typhoon Chataan struck Guam and left $60million in damage, Typhoon Halong also {{threatened}} the island, although it veered to {{the south in the}} day before it would <b>have</b> <b>struck.</b> Due to the storm, all flights were canceled in Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands, and officials advised residents in low-lying areas to evacuate. While passing to the south, Halong produced waves as high as 6m (20ft) in Inarajan. The waves left beach erosion along Guam's southern coast, and were higher than during Chataan's passage. The typhoon produced peak sustained winds of 69km/h (43mph), with gusts to 90km/h (56mph); both observations were recorded at Guam's National Weather Service. Damage on the island was estimated at $40,000. The storm disrupted work to repair damage from Chataan. Portions of the island, including Guam Memorial Hospital, had their power restored after Chataan, only to lose electricity during Halong. The additional damage caused by Halong contributed to Governor Carl T.C. Gutierrez declaring the island as a state of emergency on July22, which activated the Guam National Guard.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the northwestern}} Pacific {{there are no}} {{official}} typhoon seasons as tropical cyclones form throughout the year. Like any tropical cyclone, there are six main requirements for typhoon formation and development: sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures, atmospheric instability, high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere, enough Coriolis force to develop a low pressure center, a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance, and low vertical wind shear. While the majority of storms form between June and November, a few storms do occur between December and May (although tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum during that time). On average, the northwestern Pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally. Like other basins, they are steered by the subtropical ridge towards the west or northwest, with some systems recurving near and east of Japan. The Philippines receive {{the brunt of the}} landfalls, with China and Japan being impacted slightly less. Some of the deadliest typhoons in history <b>have</b> <b>struck</b> China. Southern China has the longest record of typhoon impacts for the region, with a thousand-year sample via documents within their archives. Taiwan has received the wettest known typhoon on record for the northwest Pacific tropical cyclone basins.|$|E
60|$|When he {{had come}} to man's estate he had defended himself from the woman's brutal assaults as he would have defended himself from another man--when she <b>had</b> <b>struck,</b> Billy <b>had</b> <b>struck</b> back; the only thing to his credit being that he never <b>had</b> <b>struck</b> her except in self-defense. Chastity in woman was to him a thing to joke of--he did not believe that it existed; for he judged other women by the one he knew best--his mother. And as he hated her, so he hated them all. He had doubly hated Barbara Harding since she not only was a woman, but a woman of the class he loathed.|$|R
