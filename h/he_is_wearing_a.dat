5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) asks Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) to {{accompany}} him to the Six Sigmas Retreat in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, following his Bush administration and CEO debacles. There, Jack meets with the Six Sigmas, six men who each embody a core feature of Six Sigma: teamwork, insight, brutality, male enhancement, hand-shake-fulness and play-hard. They disapprove of Liz's antics during the team building exercises and demand that Jack distance himself from her {{if he wants to}} succeed, which he does. Before his dinner speech, Jack psyches himself up in the men's room, completely forgetting that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> microphone and that everyone can hear him. Liz quickly takes the stage to draw attention away from Jack's embarrassment and finally ends up ripping her blouse open and dancing in front of everyone. She succeeds, and is banned from the retreat forever.|$|E
25|$|On {{the ground}} in front of Wolfe are his musket, {{cartridge}} box, and bayonet. Wolfe went into battle armed as his men were, although his musket was of higher quality. His dress is also of note. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> red coat, a red waistcoat, red breeches, and a white shirt. Such dress was rather simple, especially for a commanding officer.|$|E
25|$|In 1904, a Viking Age {{statuette}} {{identified as}} a depiction of Freyr was discovered on the farm Rällinge in Lunda, Södermanland parish {{in the province of}} Södermanland, Sweden. The depiction features a cross-legged seated, bearded male with an erect penis. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> pointed cap and stroking his triangular beard. The statue is 9 centimeters tall and is displayed at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My Immortal" [...] begins with Lee {{sitting on a}} fountain. Her legs and arms are covered with bandage as she puts them in the water. She is wearing a long white dress and is seen walking around the fountain, {{surrounded}} by children and other people {{that appear to be}} unaware or indifferent to her presence and wearabouts. Shots of Moody follow, who appears to be sullen and withdrawn. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> suit and his feet are bare. His shoulders sag and his head slumps forward as he delicately plays piano, and he later picks up his jacket as if he is about to leave. When the bridge starts, the band is shot performing in one room while Moody is in another, playing on the piano. Throughout the video, Lee is never filmed on ground level. She walks along the ledge of a fountain, sits in a tree and sings lying on top of a building. She also lies atop scaffolding and on the hood of a car surrounded with leaves.|$|E
500|$|The album cover, {{designed}} by Spinetta, shows a distressed {{man with his}} hair covered by a scarf and a tear running down his cheek; a toy arrow is stuck on his head, and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> pink shirt {{with the name of}} the band. Spinetta used tempera and pencils on mat paper. RCA considered the artwork incomprehensible and noncommercial, and shelved its first version. Spinetta said, [...] "We were not going to allow the record to be released without it. I had the picture in my head very clearly, and I went home and did it again. We did not want to leave things in the hands of mediocre company dudes that make album covers like [...]" [...] Emilio García said in 2008 that the label thought most record buyers were women, and artwork should depict men as handsomely as possible: [...] "They could not believe it, because the cover of an LP (at the time) featured artists' faces or holding electric guitars; we came out with a cover like that, which I still consider absolutely great." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{the designs}} of Homer's new art friends were not based on anybody in particular, the [...] "German guy" [...] was drawn to hold his {{cigarette}} in a [...] "European way" [...] by animation director Jim Reardon. When visiting the Springfield museum, Homer and Marge see a painting showing Akbar and Jeff, two characters from The Simpsons creator Matt Groening's comic strip Life in Hell. The painting's frame was also signed by Groening himself in real life. The painting next to Groening's was drawn by Scully's friend Tom Gagnon, who is an artist. Some of the paintings in the episode's second act were also drawn by friends of Dean Moore. At one point in Homer's dream, the Vitruvian Man appears and attacks him. According to Groening, there were [...] "some controversy" [...] {{over whether or not}} the Vitruvian Man would be in nude or not, as he is in the original painting. In the episode, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> jockstrap. At the end of the episode, Springfield is flooded with water, and Marge is seen painting a picture on the Simpsons' roof. Her painting was drawn by staff animator Amy Clese, who drew it as a recreation of a painting by J. M. W. Turner, an English Romantic painter. According to Dean Moore, the painting was [...] "pretty difficult" [...] to animate, as it was drawn with a lot of washes and gradients. He added, however, that he was [...] "very happy" [...] with it.|$|E

2500|$|... from 1337 is a [...] tall {{image of}} a {{kneeling}} three year old Shōtoku with his hands folded in prayer. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> red ancient skirt (裳) with {{the upper part of}} the body naked. Like the [...] "filial piety"-Shōtoku it is a work of the Kyoto sculptor 院憲.|$|E
5000|$|Potter's {{statements}} about seeing Walton at work invariably said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in his shirtsleeves. However, when his body <b>was</b> found, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> jacket. Underneath this jacket <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> shirt, but the sleeves {{were cut off}} above the elbow. Thus Potter could not have seen Walton in his shirtsleeves. In Fabian's view, even if Potter had merely seen Walton with his jacket off, [...] "it seems improbable he would have worked in shirt sleeves at 12.20 and then put his jacket on, unless {{he had decided to}} go home".|$|R

2500|$|On June 8, 2005, Roll filed {{a lawsuit}} against Miramax Films, {{claiming}} that the Miramax release [...] "The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D" [...] infringed upon his trademark and demanding any [...] "money, profits and advantages wrongfully gained". In November 2005, it emerged that Miramax had attempted to have the case dismissed, in addition to requesting that the court nullify Roll's trademark on the basis that [...] "Plaintiff is a male whose services are rendered only when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> costume depicting 'shark-like' attributes." [...] In April 2007, the suit was settled for an undisclosed amount.|$|E
2500|$|Such {{views are}} also shared by former CIA {{director}} James Woolsey who {{said in a}} 1999 Congressional Statement: [...] "I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian organized crime, Russian intelligence and law enforcement, and Russian business. I have often illustrated this point with the following hypothetical: If you should chance to {{strike up a conversation}} with an articulate, English-speaking Russian in, say, the restaurant of one of the luxury hotels along Lake Geneva, and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> $3,000 suit and a pair of Gucci loafers, and he tells you that he is an executive of a Russian trading company and {{wants to talk to you}} about a joint venture, then there are four possibilities. He may be what he says he is. He may be a Russian intelligence officer working under commercial cover. He may be part of a Russian organized crime group. But the really interesting possibility is that he may be all three and that none of those three institutions have any problem with the arrangement." ...|$|E
2500|$|Such {{views were}} shared by politologist Julie Anderson {{who said the}} same person can be a Russian {{intelligence}} officer, an organized criminal, and a businessman, who quoted the former CIA Director James Woolsey as saying: [...] "I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian organized crime, Russian intelligence and law enforcement, and Russian business.
