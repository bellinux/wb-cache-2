Well-known challenges in active probe-based measurement include the logistics of deploying and managing host-based measurement infrastructures, the load that probe packets place on network resources, the inaccuracy of resultant measurements, and the relatively limited set of features that can be measured. In this paper, we argue that these challenges can be addressed through programmable, router-based support for active measurement. While commercial routers today have some basic capabilities for <b>emitting</b> <b>probe</b> packets, these mechanisms are minimal and do not allow the necessary flexibility {{in the kinds of}} probing that can be done. We describe a set of functional primitives that enable a wide range of router-based active measurements and would improve and simplify the ability to assess and understand network structure and dynamic network state. We discuss the associated resource requirements and implications of our approach related to configuration, security and privacy. Finally, we support and illustrate the powerful potential of our approach through a series of measurement scenarios and describe our ongoing efforts toward a Click-based implementation of our framework.

40|$|An {{electron}} <b>emitting</b> <b>probe</b> in saturated {{floating potential}} mode {{has been used}} to investigate the temporal evolution of plasma potential and the effect of substrate RF biasing on it for pulsed dual frequency (2 MHz/ 13. 56 MHz) inductively coupled plasma (ICP) source. The low frequency power (P 2 MHz) has been pulsed at 1 KHz and a duty ratio of 50 %, while high frequency power (P 13. 56 MHz) has been used in continuous mode. The substrate has been biased with a separate bias power at (P 12. 56 MHz) Argon {{has been used as a}} discharge gas. During the ICP power pulsing, three distinct regions in a typical plasma potential profile, have been identified as ‘initial overshoot’, pulse ‘on-phase’ and pulse ‘off-phase’. It has been found out that the RF biasing of the substrate significantly modulates the temporal evolution of the plasma potential. During the initial overshoot, plasma potential decreases with increasing RF biasing of the substrate, however it increases with increasing substrate biasing for pulse ‘on-phase’ and ‘off-phase’. An interesting structure in plasma potential profile has also been observed when the substrate bias is applied and its evolution depends upon the magnitude of bias power.

40|$|The 10 {{kilowatt}} {{prototype of}} the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) engine, abbreviated as VX- 10, is designed to eject plasma at exhaust velocities of tens of kilometers per second. In this device, energy is imparted to the plasma ions by two mechanisms: ion cyclotron resonant heating (ICRH), and acceleration in an ambipolar electric field. Measurements from two different electrostatic probes are combined {{to determine how much}} each mechanism contributes to the total ion energy. The first probe is a gridded retarding potential analyzer (RPA) that incorporates a multi-channel collimator to obtain precise measurement of the ion and electron parallel energy distributions. The second is an emissive Langmuir probe that measures the DC and RF components of the plasma potential. The plasma potential obtained from the <b>emitting</b> <b>probe</b> allows calculation of the parallel velocity distribution once the parallel energy distribution is obtained from the energy analyzer data. Biasing the RPA housing is shown to minimize the plasma perturbation, as monitored by an auxiliary probe. When this minimization is done, the RPA measurements become compatible with the emissive probe's measurement of plasma potential. The collimated RPA and emissive probe have been used {{to examine the effects of}} a double dual half-turn (DDHT) antenna encircling the plasma. When power at the ion cyclotron frequency is applied, changes are seen in the saturation current and mean ion energy of the collimated RPA characteristic. The evolution of these changes as the RPA is moved downstream from the antenna is interpreted as firm evidence of ion cyclotron heating, albeit at absorbed energies of less than 1 electronvolt per ion. The emissive probe shows that, within experimental error, all of the increased ion energy is accounted for by an increase in the plasma potential that occurs when the ICRF power is applied. The combined RPA and emissive probe data also show that there is a jet of flowing plasma in the VX- 10 when operated with the helicon source alone but that the signal from this jet is overwhelmed by a rapidly growing stationary plasma within the first second of the discharge...|$|E
40|$|The {{ground and}} excited state photodynamics of a dye in {{different}} restricted environments like micelles, reverse micelles, cyclodextrins, polymers, protein and DNA has been analyzed in this work. The present thesis focuses its attention towards unrevealing {{the properties of}} different organized media through probing the environment sensitive dye. The thesis comprises six chapter (chapter 3 to chapter 8) including a review on charge transfer reaction in Chapter 1 followed a brief account of the experimental techniques with the details of instrumentation set up and methods of calculations of certain physical parameters in Chapter 2. The methods of compound preparation and purification are also described in Chapter 2. Excited state photophyiscs of 2 -(4 -(dimethylamino) styryl) - 1 -methylpyridium iodide (DASPMI) in ionic and nonionic micelles {{have been reported in}} Chapter 3. The probing of three micelles have been done with the help of DASPMI using the environmental sensitivity. The necessary shift and change in intensity reveals that DASPMI enters into all three micelles in different positions from the water solution due to active hydrophobic force and electrostatic field. The binding constant and variation of emission intensity reveal that only in non-ionic micelle the probe enters in the core region whereas in ionic micelles it is anchored in the interfacial region with different orientations. From the observed data it may be guessed that the donor group (NMe 2) of the probe is in Gouy-Chapman layer and the acceptor group resides in the Stern layer for cationic micelle whereas for anionic micelle the reverse phenomena is observed. With salt addition increase in aggregation number, mechanically trapped water and the microviscosity modulate emission intensity. Excited state photophysics of 2 -(4 -(dimethylamino) styryl) - 1 -methylpyridium iodide (DASPMI) in anionic and cationic reverse micelles (RMs) have been described in Chapter 4. From steady state data there was an indication to reside the molecule in the interfacial region near the core keeping acceptor group towards water pool in anionic micelle and for cationic micelle it was away from the core as we increase the pool size (W) of the reverse micelle. The partition constant Kp in two RMs correlate well with the position of <b>emitting</b> <b>probe</b> DASPMI in RMs interface and it corresponds nicely with the values obtained from anisotropy data. The rotational restriction experienced by DASPMI in anionic reverse micelle decreases with increasing hydration. The in-situ measurements of micropolarity and microviscosity around the probe with increasing pool size (W) show enhanced micropolarity and a decrease in microviscosity. Increased emission quenching by Cu 2 + is due to counterion exchange of Cu 2 + by Na+ at the micellar interface and due to increased local concentration of Cu 2 +. Chapter 5 deals with photophysics of 2 -(4 -(dimethylamino) styryl) - 1 -methylpyridium iodide (DASPMI) in different Cyclodextrin environments. Nice 1 : 1 inclusion complex with β-CD in the excited state could be found with the dimethylamino group of the molecule sticking out as revealed from steady state and time-resolved emission. The inclusion complex has a longer decay time compared to that in neat water. Time-resolved anisotropy decay has been used to study the rotational dynamics of the molecule inside cyclodextrin cavity. The average angular structure of inclusion complex as found from semiemperical PM 3 calculations corroborates the experimental results of angular orientation in β-CD excellently. The minimum energy of the complex is found to be nearly 5 Å length of the molecule with dimethylamino part sticking out in the bulk water. Hydrogen bonding at the rim hinders inclusion complex of o-DASPMI in γ- CD and instead it produces association at the rim. Hydrogen bond breaker urea breaks the bonding of o-DASPMI with the rim of γ-CD and the formation of inclusion complex with γ- CD ensues. The interaction of anionic micelle Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and amphiphilic block copolymers poly ethylene-b-polyethylene glycol (PE-b-PEG) and the sharp change of excited state charge transfer complex photophysics of 2 -(4 -(dimethylamino) styryl) - 1 - methylpyridinium iodide (DASPMI) inside the supramolecular assembly have been addressed in Chapter 6. The dramatic enhancement of emission intensity of DASPMI incorporated inside the nano structure formed by micellar and polymeric chains indicates completely different environment, compared to that in water and micellar system. The SEM picture also confirmed the formation of assembly between the polymer and the micelle. Huge increase in rotational relaxation time obtained from time-resolved anisotropy decay and the value of order parameter is indicative of much restrictive regime in the self assembly system. The wobbling and translational motion of the probe is also restricted inside micelle-polymer aggregate due to the presence of polymer chains. The translational diffusion coefficient gets drastically reduced due to the aggregation. The composite polymer micelle system has got a solvent reorientation time. Chapter 7 deals with the mode of interaction of 2 -(4 -(dimethylamino) styryl) - 1 - methylpyridinium iodide (DASPMI) with Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in buffer as well as in reverse micelle (RM) environments. The binding of DASPMI with BSA is confirmed by Field Emission Scanning Microscope (FESEM), Cyclic Voltametry (CV), Circular Dichroic Spectra (CD) and 1 H NMR techniques. The most important thing of the investigation is that subdomain IIA of BSA is doubly active inside RM compared to that in buffer solution and the activity of subdomain IIIA in RM is halved compared to that in buffer solution. The values of micropolarity around the probe helps us to determined the actual sites of BSA, responsible for binding. The time resolved decay time further corroborate this attachment of DASPMI with different sites of BSA in different environments. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from BSA to DASPMI in buffer solution is measured to be 27 % whereas, for that in reverse micelle it is found to be increased to 36 %. The greater FRET efficiency also indicates that probe is located much more nearer to Tryptophan (Trp) of BSA and stronger binding between BSA-DASPMI complex in RM than in buffer. The mode of binding of 2 -(4 -(dimethylamino) styryl) - 1 -methylpyridinium iodide (DASPMI) with calf thymus DNA as revealed from different steady state and time-resolved emission spectroscopic measurements has been reported in Chapter 8. Fluorescence enhancement of DASPMI and its quenching by KI and also strong dependence on ionic strength or salt in controlling the binding of DASPMI with DNA by electrostatic interaction confirms groove binding. The value of binding constant from emission and association constant from circular dichroic spectrum also indicates weak binding. Increase in steady state anisotropy and fluorescence lifetime hints at binding with DNA. Visualization of theoretical modeling confirms groove binding as a crescent with a curvature of 11. 35 Ǻ, which is complementary to the natural curvature of the minor of B-DNA.

This system detects howling by calculating distances between zero crossings in the subband input signal. A stable subband zero crossing distance measure indicates that howling is present in a particular subband. This triggers an adaptation to estimate and attenuate the feedback channel.

40|$|Noctuid moths (Noctuidae) are {{the only}} group of {{invertebrates}} for whom echolocation was demonstrated [2, 3]. The probing signals of these insects are short-wavelength ultrasonic clicks that are emitted during flight at a close to horizontal wing posi-tion. The maximum radius of the echolocation system sensitivity is 10 to 35 cm according to different authors [2 - 4]. Studies of the capability for echolocation in noctuid moths demonstrated no definite responses to echo [2, 3]: the moths either flew toward the object discovered by echolocation or around it. Moreover, the motivation changed {{several times during the}} experiment. Such a variation in the insect's behavior introduced uncertainty into experimental results, and the problem of searching for more stable parameters arose for the moth's ability to respond to echo. Similar problems appeared and were then solved in studies of bat responses to model stimuli. The increase of <b>emitted</b> <b>probing</b> signals may be used as an indicator of an increased attention of bats to biologi-cally important echolocation information [1]. These changes were reproducible and could be easily recorded. The question of how noctuid moths behave in similar situations arises. We suggested that echolocation stimulation induces a similar increase in the frequency of acoustic signals emitted by a noctuid moth. Here, we verify this suggestion. To record emitted signals, a moth was fixed on a long thin wire of a horizontal shift detector and stimu-lated with acoustic signals that simulated the echo of its own clicks. The scheme of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. An amplified natural signal from the microphone output was transmitted to a computer-operated electronic switch.

Among them, monoclinic β-Ga 2 O 3 is well known by its large direct bandgap of ∼ 4. 9 eV being considered a deep UV TCO suitable for operation in short wavelength optoelectronic devices. The wide bandgap of β-Ga 2 O 3 is also appropriate for the incorporation of several electronic energy levels such as those associated with the intra- 4 fn configuration of rare earth ions. Among these, Eu 3 + ions (4 f 6) are widely used as a red <b>emitting</b> <b>probes</b> both in organic and inorganic compounds. In this work, undoped and Eu 2 O 3 doped (0. 1 and 3. 0 mol%) Ga 2 O 3 crystalline fibres were grown by the laser floating zone approach. All fibres were found to stabilize in the monoclinic β-Ga 2 O 3 structure while for the heavily doped fibres the X-ray diffraction patterns show, in addition a cubic europium gallium garnet phase, Eu 3 Ga 5 O 12. The spectroscopic properties of the undoped and Eu doped fibres were analysed by Raman spectroscopy, low temperature photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE). The Eu 3 + luminescence is mainly originated in the garnet, from where different europium site locations can be inferred. The spectral analysis indicates {{that at least one}} of the centres corresponds to Eu 3 + ions in dodecahedral site symmetry. For the lightly doped samples, the spectral shape and intensity ratio of the 5 D 0 → 7 FJ transitions is totally different from those on Eu 3 Ga 5 O 12, suggesting that the emitting ions are placed in low symmetry sites in the β-Ga 2 O 3 host.

40|$|The structural, optical, and photophysical {{properties}} of 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25 -octabutoxyphthalocyaninato-palladium(II), PdPc(OBu) 8, {{and the newly}} synthesized platinum analogue PtPc(OBu) 8 are investigated combining X-ray crystallography, static and transient absorption spectroscopy, and relativistic zeroth-order regular approximation (ZORA) Density Functional Theory (DFT) /Time Dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations where spin−orbit coupling (SOC) effects are explicitly considered. The results are compared to those previously reported for NiPc(OBu) 8 (J. Phys. Chem. A 2005, 109, 2078) {{in an effort to}} highlight the effect of the central metal on the structural and photophysical {{properties of}} the group 10 transition metal octabutoxyphthalocyanines. Different from the nickel analogue, PdPc(OBu) 8 and PtPc(OBu) 8 show a modest and irregular saddling distortion of the macrocycle, but share with the first member of the group similar UV−vis spectra, with the deep red and intense Q-band absorption experiencing a blue shift down the group, as observed in virtually all tetrapyrrolic complexes of this triad. The blue shift of the Q-band along the MPc(OBu) 8 (M = Ni, Pd, Pt) series is interpreted {{on the basis of the}} metal-induced electronic structure changes. Besides the intense deep red absorption, the title complexes exhibit a distinct near-infrared (NIR) absorption due to a transition to the double-group 1 E (π,π*) state, which is dominated by the lowest single-group 3 E (π,π*) state. Unlike NiPc(OBu) 8, which is nonluminescent, PdPc(OBu) 8 and PtPc(OBu) 8 show both deep red fluorescence emission and NIR phosphorescence emission. Transient absorption experiments and relativistic spin−orbit TDDFT calculations consistently indicate that fluorescence and phosphorescence emissions occur from the S 1 (π,π*) and T 1 (π,π*) states, respectively, the latter being directly populated from the former, and the triplet state decays directly to the S 0 surface (the triplet lifetime in deaerated benzene solution was 3. 04 μs for Pd and 0. 55 μs for Pt). Owing to their triplet properties, PdPc(OBu) 8 and PtPc(OBu) 8 have potential for use in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and are potential candidates for NIR light emitting diodes or NIR <b>emitting</b> <b>probes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The lattice {{location}} of low-dose implanted Er in GaN, GaN:O, and GaN:C was investigated using the emission channeling technique. The conversion electrons <b>emitted</b> by the <b>probe</b> isotope $^{ 167 m}$Er give direct {{evidence that the}} majority (~ 90 %) of Er atoms are located on substitutional Ga sites for all samples. Annealing up to 900 °C does not change these fractions, although it reduces the Er root-mean-square (rms) displacements. The only visible effect of oxygen or carbon doping is a small increase in the rms displacements {{with respect to the}} undoped sample...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{interaction}} model enabling data-source probes and action-based gauges to communicate using an intelligent event model known as ActEvents. ActEvents build on conventional event concepts by associating structural and semantic information with raw data, thereby allowing recipients {{to be able}} to dynamically understand the content of new kinds of events. Two submodels of ActEvents are proposed: SmartEvents, which are XML-structured events containing references to their syntactic and semantic models, and Gaugents, which are heavier but more flexible intelligent mobile software agents. This model is presented in light of DARPA’s DASADA program, where ActEvents are used in a larger-scale subsystem, called KX, which supports continual validation of distributed, componentbased systems. ActEvents are <b>emitted</b> by <b>probes</b> in this architecture, and propagated to gauges, where “measurements ” of the raw data associated with probes are made, thereby continually determining updated target-system properties. ActEvents are also proposed as solutions for a number of other applications, including a distributed collaborative virtual environment (CVE) known as CHIME...|$|R
40|$|Sound Source Localization (SSL) {{based on}} {{microphone}} arrays has numerous applications, and has received significant research attention. Common to all published {{research is the}} observation that the accuracy of SSL degrades with reverberation. Indeed, early (strong) reflections can have amplitudes similar to the direct signal, and will often interfere with the estimation. In this paper, we show that reverberation is not the enemy, {{and can be used}} to improve estimation. More specifically, we are able to use early reflections to significantly improve range and elevation estimation. The process requires two steps: during setup, a loudspeaker integrated with the array <b>emits</b> a <b>probing</b> sound, which is used to obtain estimates of the ceiling height, as well as the locations of the walls. In a second step (e. g., during a meeting), the device incorporates this knowledge into a maximum likelihood SSL algorithm. Experimental results on both real and synthetic data show huge improvements in range estimation accuracy...|$|R
