5000|$|A project [...] "Partnership for {{the living}} Danube" [...] was {{established}} in 2007. Within the scopes of the project, 37 ha of Gornje Podunavlje's wetlands were revitalized. A new method of removing the wooden and shrub vegetation, which suffocated the life {{in and around the}} ponds of Sarkanj and Semenjača, was implemented. A mosaic of natural habitats (wet meadows-saline marshes-water [...] "mirrors") was restored. Floating plant colonies were also restored and regenerated: yellow iris, common duckweed, reed, <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>water</b> <b>lily,</b> yellow water-lily, common cattail and sedge. They soon became the nesting place for many wading birds. Some birds, absent from the area for over a century, returned. In 2017 works on revitalization of the marsh Široki Rit began, on an area of 53 ha while the Štrbac locality is scheduled to be next.|$|E
