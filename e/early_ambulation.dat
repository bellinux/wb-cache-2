40|$|Aim and objectives. To {{investigate}} if ambulation {{four hours}} after sheath removal can replace ambulation 10 {{hours or more}} after sheath removal with regard to puncture site complications after percutaneous coronary interventions and to examine patient comfort in both groups. Background. <b>Early</b> <b>ambulation</b> after percutaneous coronary intervention may facilitate earlier hospital discharge. Whether this approach is safe, is unknown. Design. A non-randomised comparative study. Methods. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed by femoral approach. Registered nurses of the ward removed the sheath and haemostasis was achieved by manual compression. After bed rest with a compression bandage for four hours, the patients in the <b>early</b> <b>ambulation</b> group were ambulated. The patients {{in the control group}} stayed in bed till the next morning. Primary study endpoint was the composition of puncture site complications: haematoma, bleeding, false aneurysm and arteriovenous fistula. Secondary endpoints were occurrence of vasovagal collapse after mobilisation, back pain and problems with voiding. Results. In the <b>early</b> <b>ambulation</b> group (n = 329) the total number of complications was nine (2. 7 %), vs. six (3. 0 %) in the control group (n = 202). The complication rate in the <b>early</b> <b>ambulation</b> group is not increased compared to the control group (test for non-inferiority p = 0. 002). Hence non-inferiority is accepted and practical equivalence shown. There were no statistically significant differences concerning patient comfort between the groups. Conclusions. <b>Early</b> <b>ambulation</b> four hours after femoral sheath removal is feasible and safe. The incidence of puncture site complications in the <b>early</b> <b>ambulation</b> group is not increased in comparison with the group with prolonged bed rest. Relevance to clinical practice. Patients could possibly be discharged earlier after percutaneous coronary intervention, allowing percutaneous coronary intervention in an ambulant setting.

40|$|Purpose: Examine the {{beneficial}} effect of early nasogastric tube (NGT) removal in patients undergoing radical cystectomy with urinary diversion. Patients and Methods: 43 consecutive patients underwent radical cystectomy with urinary diversion and were randomized into 2 groups. In {{the intervention group}} (n = 22), the NGT was removed 12 hours after the operation. Comparatively, {{in the control group}} (n = 21), the NGT remained in place until the appearance of the first flatus. The appearance of ileus, patient ambulation, time to regular diet, and hospital discharge of the two patient groups were assessed. Patient discomfort due to the NGT was also recorded. Results: The 2 groups showed statistical homogeneity of their baseline characteristics. Two patients (9. 09 %) from the intervention and 3 patients (14. 3 %) from the control group developed postoperative ileus and were treated conservatively. No significant differences in intraoperative, postoperative, bowel outcomes or other complications were found between the two groups. All patients preferred the NGT to be removed first in comparison to their other co-existing drains. Conclusions: This is the first randomized, prospective study, to our knowledge, to assess early NGT removal after radical cystectomy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Postoperative pain is an {{important}} factor affecting anesthesia and surgery. OBJECTIVES: The present study assessed the effects of 1200 mg gabapentin, an anticonvulsant drug that acts through voltage-dependent calcium channels, for the control of postoperative pain in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. METHODS: Fifty patients undergoing hysterectomy were enrolled in the present study. Subjects received either 1200 mg gabapentin or placebo 2 h before surgery. The amount of morphine consumption and level of postoperative pain at 2 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h after surgery were measured. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences in}} age, duration of surgery and anesthesia, or body mass index between the two groups. The mean intensity of pain in the gabapentin group was significantly lower than in the placebo group. The mean amount of morphine used in the placebo group (5. 2 Â± 2. 8 mg) was significantly higher than in gabapentin group (1. 2 Â± 0. 29 mg; P= 0. 001). Nausea and vomiting in the placebo group was more common than in the gabapentin group (P= 0. 001). The time interval for initial ambulation after surgery was significantly shorter in the gabapentin group (12. 24 Â± 2. 18 h) compared with the placebo group (15 Â± 3. 61 h; P= 0. 002). CONCLUSION: 1200 mg gabapentin reduced postoperative pain and the need for opioids, and enabled <b>earlier</b> <b>ambulation</b> of the patient. Significant side effects were not observed.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundConventionally the {{appendix}} is removed through a right lower quadrant transverse incision or a gridiron incision approximately 5 cm in length. In this modern era of minimally invasive surgery, {{there is a}} lot of emphasis on cosmesis and early recovery. We performed a prospective, double blind, randomised trial to evaluate a new incision for appendectomy to compare with conventional appendectomy. MethodsOne hundred and twenty patients, aged between 3 and 18 years, were randomized to receive either small access appendectomy (SAA) (n= 60, 53 acute appendicitis and 7 interval appendectomy) or conventional appendectomy (CAP) (n= 60, 55 acute appendicitis and 5 interval appendectomy). SAA was performed through an incision in the lateral 1 / 3 of the spino-umblical line, lateral to McBurney's point. The caecum along with {{the appendix}} could be delivered through this small incision easily as the ileal loops did not interfere with the delivery. All patients suspected of acute appendicitis were evaluated by the modified Alvarado's system to reduce the rate of negative appendectomies. Patients with diffuse peritonitis were excluded. ResultsThe demographic data for the two groups were similar. The SAA group required less analgesics (p< 0. 001), had <b>earlier</b> <b>ambulation</b> and shorter hospital stay (p< 0. 001), and better cosmetic score (p< 0. 001), but the operation took longer (p< 0. 001) compared to the CAP group.

We considered randomized controlled trials, prospective or retrospective cohort studies that compared the outcomes of acute DVT patients managed with <b>early</b> <b>ambulation</b> versus bed rest, in addition to standard anticoagulation. Meta-analysis pertaining to the incidence of new pulmonary embolism (PE), progression of DVT, and DVT related deaths were conducted, as well as the extent of remission of pain and edema. 13 studies were included with a total of 3269 patients. Compared to bed rest, <b>early</b> <b>ambulation</b> was not associated with a higher incidence of new PE, progression of DVT, or DVT related deaths (RD - 0. 03, 95 % CI - 0. 05 ∼ - 0. 02; Z = 1. 24, p = 0. 22; random effect model, Tau 2 = 0. 01). Moreover, if the patients suffered moderate or severe pain initially, <b>early</b> <b>ambulation</b> was related to a better outcome, with respect to remission of acute pain in the affected limb (SMD 0. 42, 95 %CI 0. 09 ∼ 0. 74; Z = 2. 52, p = 0. 01; random effect model, Tau 2 = 0. 04).

40|$|Objectives - Several {{devices have}} been {{proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} manual compression (MC) for femoral access management (FAME) following catheterization. Although these devices allow <b>earlier</b> <b>ambulation,</b> they have not always been shown to reduce vascular complications. As a consequence, their cost efficacy is not obvious. Methods - During MC a special catheter deployed temporarily within the artery to achieve haemostasis (Bio-DISC (TM)) (BD) was compared with an anchor-collagen based system Angio-Seal (TM) (AS) among 463 consecutive patients undergoing PCI. We examined vascular or systemic complications, nursing time spent to puncture site management and patient's satisfaction. Results - Relative contra-indications to the use of vascular closure devices were encountered in 158 patients. There {{were no significant differences in}} baseline characteristics between the patients assigned to each of the 3 treatment groups. The deployment success rate was 98 % for AS and 90 % for BD (p = 0. 037). Vascular complications occurred in 10. 8 %, 4. 0 % and 5. 8 % (p: NS) of MC, AS and BD patients, respectively. The longer sheath dwell time contributed to most of the complications in MC and BD. Nursing time spent for access management was 48. 9 min in MC; 28. 1 min in BD and 9. 9 min in AS (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{efficacy}} of a new hemostatic puncture closure device (HPCD) (Angioseal*), 100 patients who underwent coronary angiography (75) or coronary angioplasty (25), using femoral approach, were randomized between HPCD placement (N= 52) or regular compression (C) (manual or mechanical pressure then pressure dressing) (N= 48). Clinical data, anticoagulation regimen, sheath size, delay of sheath removal, aPTT at the removal were not statistically different in both groups. Pts were randomized immediately before the sheath removal. A serial clinical follow-up was done until 24 hours and a systematic vascular ultrasonography (with pulsed and color doppler examination) was performed before hospital discharge. In the HPCD group, device placement was successful in all but one. Hemostasis was immediate in 67 %; in 8 pts (15 %) a light manual pressure was necessary (15 ± 10 min.) to stop the bleeding.

40|$|The current {{trend in}} the non-operative {{treatment}} of femoral shaft fractures is away from prolonged traction and towards <b>early</b> <b>ambulation.</b> The cast brace treatment involves external support to the limb {{in such a way}} that maximal use can occur during healing. <b>Early</b> <b>ambulation,</b> while a fracture is healing, provides an environment for complete bone healing as well as allowing joint movement so that the function of the limb is as near normal as possible at the completion of treatment.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of early fitting in trans-tibial amputees. The {{assumption}} is that compared to elastic bandaging, {{the use of a}} rigid dressing in early fitting will result in quicker wound healing and <b>earlier</b> <b>ambulation.</b> A retrospective file search was carried out in three different hospitals, analysing the time to first prosthesis, the incidence of local and general complications and the functional outcome after discharge from hospital. Each of the hospitals used a different method of postoperative care: elastic bandaging, immediate postoperative application of the plaster cast or delayed application of the plaster cast within one week post amputation. In comparison to the elastic bandaging method (N =  52), the use of a rigid dressing in the early fitting method (immediate and delayed, N =  97) resulted in a statistically significant shorter period from amputation to the delivery of a first regular prosthesis (110 days vs 50 days) and a decreased risk of knee flexion contracture. Although, differences in local complications were not observed, the risk of pressure sores in other places than the stump was increased in early fitting. Instead of further reducing the time to first prosthesis by immediate fitting, the use of delayed fitting resulted in a statistically significant shorter period from amputation to the delivery of a first regular prosthesis (56 vs 40 days). However, delayed fitting was associated with an increased risk for reamputation. In conclusion, this study indicates that early fitting by use of a rigid dressing after trans-tibial amputation is the treatment of choice. If it is possible to apply a plaster cast in the operating room, the authors would prefer the immediate fitting method...|$|R
30|$|A recent {{clinical}} report evaluated morbidity {{associated with}} iliac crest harvesting [11]. At 1  week after harvesting, 28 and 72  % {{of the subjects}} felt severe pain and moderate pain, respectively. At 1  month after harvesting, 22 and 67  % of the subjects felt moderate pain and mild pain, respectively. The scars after harvesting were also evaluated, based on the patient satisfaction score, revealing that 22  % of the subjects felt bad about their condition [11]. Furthermore, Joshi et al. [12] reported that approximately 56  % of patients who underwent conventional iliac crest harvesting had postoperative gait disturbance for more than 2  weeks. Because gait disturbance {{is associated with the}} degree of invasiveness, a short incision can minimize the risk of complications [6]. To our knowledge, few articles have reported harvesting techniques using a trephine bur [4, 6, 13]. Burstein et al. [6] reported that the trephine bur technique can reduce incision length compared with conventional methods (2 vs. 5  cm). As a result, the use of the trephine bur technique permitted <b>earlier</b> <b>ambulation</b> and discharge from hospital [4, 6, 13]. Missiuna et al. [14] reported the morbidity associated with iliac crest harvesting using a trephine bur. They found that 69 and 100  % of the subjects were completely without pain at 1 and 8  weeks, respectively, after harvesting. Furthermore, none of the subjects reported any unpleasant signs and symptoms related to the residual scar. In another study, the use of a trephine to procure corticocancellous bone cores from the anterior iliac crest was found to carry a high risk of peritoneal perforation [15]. In our case, the trephine bur was used only for cutting of the cortical bone, and the cancellous bone was gently harvested with hand curettes. Consequently, there were no surgical complications.|$|R
