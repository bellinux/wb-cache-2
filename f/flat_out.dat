5|$|As {{the novel}} progresses, Raskolnikov is {{introduced}} to the detective Porfiry, who begins to suspect him of the murder purely on psychological grounds. At the same time, a chaste relationship develops between Raskolnikov and Sonya. Sonya, though a prostitute, is full of Christian virtue and is only driven into the profession by her family's poverty. Meanwhile, Razumikhin and Raskolnikov manage to keep Dunya from continuing her relationship with Luzhin, whose true character is exposed to be conniving and base. At this point, Svidrigaïlov appears on the scene, having come from the province to Petersburg, almost solely to seek out Dunya. He reveals that his wife, Marfa Petrovna, is dead, {{and that he is}} willing to pay Dunya a vast sum of money in exchange for nothing. She, upon hearing the news, refuses <b>flat</b> <b>out,</b> suspecting him of treachery.|$|E
5|$|In the 400m {{freestyle}} heats, Windle and Talbot made a misjudgement; in {{an attempt}} to conserve his energy for the final they decided that Windle should not go <b>flat</b> <b>out,</b> and Windle was four seconds slower than he was at the Australian Championships. Windle was one of the top seeds for the race, and Talbot advised him to swim hard {{in the first half of}} the race before slowing down. However, he swam too slowly and missed the final completely. Although he won his heat by seven seconds in a time of 4min 21.6s, he was the ninth fastest overall, so he missed the final by one position with a time deficit of 0.5s. The slowest qualifier was Tsuyoshi Yamanaka, who had been prevented from withdrawing from the race by his coaches. On the other hand, the two other Australian representatives who he defeated at the national championships did make the final, including Wood, who went on to win bronze. Talbot said that the tactical error was mostly his responsibility and that he learnt a lot from it.|$|E

25|$|On 31 May Stanning, partnered by Helen Glover, won {{her first}} European title at the 2015 European Rowing Championships held in Poznan Poland. They won both their {{heat and the}} semi-final and set a new European record time of 6:58.28 in the final. They {{defeated}} the silver medallists, Noemie Kober and Marie Le Nepvou of the Netherlands, by over six seconds. Glover said: It's good to keep them tallying up and keep it exciting, but we don't go <b>flat</b> <b>out</b> on the start line thinking {{the aim of the}} day is to break records. Quadruple Olympic gold medallist Sir Matthew Pinsent, reporting in The Times, described Glover and Stanning as Within reach of sporting immortality.|$|E
25|$|Assessment of {{metabolic}} {{rates is}} complicated by the distinction between the rates while resting and while active. In all modern reptiles and most mammals and birds the maximum rates during all-out activity are 10 to 20 times higher than minimum rates while at rest. However, in a few mammals these rates differ by a factor of 70. Theoretically it would be possible for a land vertebrate to have a reptilian metabolic rate at rest and a bird-like rate while working <b>flat</b> <b>out.</b> However, an animal with such a low resting rate would be unable to grow quickly. The huge herbivorous sauropods may have been on the move so constantly in search of food that their energy expenditure would have been much the same irrespective of whether their resting metabolic rates were high or low.|$|E

25|$|The queen now placed Saw Hnit, a 14-year-old son of Kyawswa, on the throne. Though he {{was still}} styled as king, the inexperienced Saw Hnit was {{for all intents and}} {{purposes}} a puppet of the three brothers, his regents. She had to accept the arrangement although she never fully acknowledged the presence of a new dynasty in Upper Burma. Nevertheless, she remained the symbol of the old dynasty, and her imprimatur was still much sought after. According to Hmannan, Thihathu asked her to anoint him as the rightful successor of Pagan at his coronation ceremony at Pinya. The queen <b>flat</b> <b>out</b> refused; in fact, she was quite insulting in her reply. It was only after Thihathu sent another humble letter that she relented. On 7 February 1313, at Thihathu's coronation ceremony, the dowager queen presented to Thihathu a golden belt and a golden tray, which had been handed down in the royal family since the time of King Anawrahta.|$|E
25|$|Lamptey joined Venezia in Italy {{and later}} Unión de Santa Fe in Argentina. There, {{he and his}} wife had their third child, Diego. But soon, Diego died of a rare disease. A major {{emotional}} blow was also the fact that Lamptey wanted to bury his son in Ghana, but the authorities declined. Heartbroken, Lamptey temporarily gave up football. After unsuccessful stints at Ankaragücü and União Leiria, Lamptey got himself a new German player agent who transferred him to SpVgg Greuther Fürth. However, Lamptey and his wife were unhappy there, unable to live through the culture shock in Germany. Lamptey was not entirely unsuccessful, being a reliable backup, but was found too fragile for the rough Second Bundesliga. He was also reportedly ignored by his German colleagues, and once, a colleague <b>flat</b> <b>out</b> refused to sleep in the same hotel room as him. This blatant racism shocked Lamptey, but even worse was the fact that his child Lisa also died soon after birth. Also Lamptey's second dead child was buried abroad, in Germany. The Lampteys soon left for Asia.|$|E
25|$|Murray {{summoned the}} Corps Chiefs of Staff at around 1am on 24 August (the {{night after the}} Battle of Mons), and ordered them to retreat, but gave them no {{detailed}} plans, leaving them {{to work out the}} details themselves. French agreed to Haig’s request that I Corps retreat east of the Forest of Mormal (Haig Diary, 24 August) without, apparently, Smith-Dorrien (GOC II Corps) being asked or informed. (Inept staffwork was not unique to GHQ – neither I nor II Corps staff had checked whether or not the Forest of Mormal was occupied by the enemy.) On 24 August Harper refused to do anything for Murray, so that Lord Loch had to write messages even though it was not his job. Loch wrote in his diary for that day that Murray was “by nature petulant” and “difficult to work with”. Murray and his staff were working <b>flat</b> <b>out</b> in intense heat at Bavai, and recorded (24 August) that he had passed 24 hours without undressing or sleeping. Smith-Dorrien visited GHQ to request detailed orders on the evening of 24 August, and had to bully Murray into issuing orders for II Corps to retreat to Le Cateau.|$|E
5000|$|Corvette {{production}} {{started in}} 1974 in Lymington by Corvette Marine {{with the introduction}} of a 32 ft British-built, [...] "trawler"-styled family cruiser designed by naval architect, Terry Compton of Compton-McGill. This, however, was a trawler yacht with a difference. The Corvette 32 had a most unusual hull shape (round bilge sections flanked by shallow vee <b>flats</b> <b>out</b> to the chine). This semi-planing design gave the Corvette significantly better performance than normally achieved by the more traditional displacement hull used on this type of craft.|$|R

25|$|After a new pit building, the Silverstone Wing, was {{completed}} {{in time for the}} 2011 race, the start of the track was relocated to between Club Corner and Abbey Corner. Almost <b>flat</b> <b>out,</b> the right-hander of Abbey leads immediately into the left-hander of Farm before cars brake heavily into the second gear, right-handed turn three; Village Corner. The even slower left-hander of the Loop comes immediately after, and leads into the flat-out left-hander of Aintree, before cars head down the DRS zone of the Wellington Straight; designed in 2010 to promote overtaking at the track. Turn 6, the left hander of Brooklands, is taken by drivers in second gear and leads immediately into Luffield, another second gear curve; a right-hand hairpin. The right-handed kink of Woodcote leads cars down the old pit straight, before the difficult sixth-gear right-hander of Copse, with a minimum speed of 175mph in the dry for Formula One cars. Then, the challenging complex of Maggotts, Becketts and Chapel - a left-right-left-right-left complex with a minimum speed of 130mph- lead cars down the 770-metre Hangar Straight with the fifth-gear right-hander of Stowe at the end. The fifteenth turn of the track, Stowe, has a minimum speed of 125mph and precedes a short straight, named Vale, which leads cars downhill towards the Club complex. Heavy braking is required for the left-hander of turn 16, and understeer can be an issue for the next right-handers of turns 17 and 18, as cars tentatively accelerate round to the start-finish straight.|$|E

50|$|However, Punggol 21 did not {{materialise}} {{fully as}} Singapore's economy {{was affected by}} the Asian economic crisis in 1997.
