25|$|A {{systematic}} review of 84 trials examined {{the evidence for}} various treatments in GPA.

25|$|A {{systematic}} review estimated that inactivity {{is responsible for}} 6% {{of the burden of}} disease from coronary heart disease worldwide. The authors estimated that 121,000 deaths from coronary heart disease could have been averted in Europe in 2008, if physical inactivity had been removed. A Cochrane review found some evidence that yoga has favourable effects on blood pressure and cholesterol, but studies included <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>review</b> were of low quality.|$|E

25|$|The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists {{and medical}} policy makers review {{research}} studies and find more incidence of suspected or proven sepsis, RDS, hypoglycemia, need for respiratory support, need for NICU admission, {{and need for}} hospitalization > 4–5 days. In the case of caesarean sections, rates of respiratory death were 14 times higher in pre-labor at 37 compared with 40 weeks gestation, and 8.2 times higher for pre-labor caesarean at 38 weeks. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>review,</b> no studies found decreased neonatal morbidity due to non-medically indicated (elective) delivery before 39 weeks.|$|E
25|$|A {{withdrawal}} syndrome {{is seen in}} about 20% of pediatric intensive care unit children after infusions with benzodiazepines or opioids. The likelihood of having the syndrome correlates with total infusion duration and dose, although duration {{is thought to be}} more important. Treatment for withdrawal usually involves weaning over a 3- to 21-day period if the infusion lasted for more than a week. Symptoms include tremors, agitation, sleeplessness, inconsolable crying, diarrhea and sweating. In total, over fifty withdrawal symptoms are listed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>review</b> article. Environmental measures aimed at easing the symptoms of neonates with severe abstinence syndrome had little impact, but providing a quiet sleep environment helped in mild cases.|$|E
25|$|In a Swedish (2003) study benzodiazepines were {{implicated in}} 39% of suicides by drug {{poisoning}} {{in the elderly}} 1992-1996. Nitrazepam and flunitrazepam accounted for 90% of benzodiazepine implicated suicides. In cases where benzodiazepines contributed to death, but were not the sole cause, drowning, typically in the bath, was a common method used. Benzodiazepines were the predominant drug class in suicides <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>review</b> of Swedish death certificates. In 72% of the cases, benzodiazepines were the only drug consumed. Thus, many of deaths associated with benzodiazepine overdoses {{may not be a}} direct result of the toxic effects but either due to being combined with other drugs or used as a tool to complete suicide using a different method, e.g. drowning.|$|E
30|$|More than 5000 {{descriptors}} covering listening, speaking, reading, writing, translation, interpretation, {{grammar and}} pragmatics were then arranged {{into more than}} 200 questionnaires to collect feedbacks {{on the quality of}} the descriptors, including explicitness and clarity of wording, completeness of structure, and appropriateness of classification.

25|$|Benzodiazepines were {{implicated in}} 39% of suicides by drug {{poisoning}} in Sweden, with nitrazepam and flunitrazepam accounting for 90% of benzodiazepine implicated suicides, {{in the elderly}} {{over a period of}} 2 decades. In three quarters of cases death was due to drowning, typically in the bath. Benzodiazepines were the predominant drug class in suicides <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>review</b> of Swedish death certificates. In 72% of the cases benzodiazepines were the only drug consumed. Benzodiazepines and in particular nitrazepam and flunitrazepam should therefore be prescribed with caution in the elderly. In a brain sample of a fatal nitrazepam poisoning high concentrations of nitrazepam and its metabolite were found in the brain of the deceased person.|$|E
2500|$|A Cochrane {{review in}} 2013 {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that delayed cord clamping (between one and three minutes after birth) is [...] "likely to be beneficial as long as access to treatment for jaundice requiring phototherapy is available". <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>review</b> delayed clamping, as contrasted to early, resulted in no difference in risk of severe maternal postpartum hemorrhage or neonatal mortality, low Apgar score. On the other hand, delayed clamping resulted in an increased birth weight of on average about 100 g, and an increased hemoglobin concentration of on average 1.5 g/dL with half the risk of being iron deficient at three and six months, but an increased risk of jaundice requiring phototherapy.|$|E
