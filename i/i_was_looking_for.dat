The Vikings wanted a four-year deal, but Munnerlyn signed a three-year deal so he could receive his third contract before turning 30. Munnerlyn stated, [...] "I had other visits set up but the number that Minnesota offered me was the number <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b> I was like, 'Man, instead of leaving this offer out there I'm {{just going to take}} this.

500|$|Carter said of {{the casting}} of Nick Chinlund as Pfaster, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} wonderfully creepy villain. The casting of that show was very difficult. We saw many actors, but there was a quality <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> and I couldn't put a name on that quality. I finally figured out what it was when Nick came in and he had a kind of {{androgynous}} quality that worked. I thought he looked like Joe College, but he could scare the hell out of you." [...] Producer Glen Morgan said Chinlund's performance was outstanding. Nutter stated [...] "Nick Chinlund was wonderful to work with. The guy was like putty in my hands. He was great. If you're looking for someone to underline the weirdness and strangeness of the character, he did that." ...|$|E

Harrod said that [...] "I went and had a look and was amazed to find that the Crown at Whitebrook ticked all the boxes for what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b> It had the location, the quality suppliers and I knew straight away that I had been looking in the wrong place."

500|$|In Sherrybaby, Gyllenhaal {{played a}} young drug-addicted thief {{trying to put}} her life in order after prison so she can {{reconcile}} with her daughter. During promotion of the film, she noted of her portrayal of the character: [...] "I think she's in such dire straights [...] that all she has are these kind of naive, fierce hope. And while I was playing the part <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> pleasure and hope in everything, even in these really bleak things. And {{so it was really}} mostly after I finished the movie that I felt pain." [...] Her performance in the film was well received: David Germain of the Associated Press wrote, [...] "Gyllenhaal humanizes her so deeply and richly... that Sherry elicits sympathy even in her darkest and weakest moments", and Dennis Harvey of Variety called her performance [...] "naturalistic". For her work, Gyllenhaal earned her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and won the Best Actress category award at the 2006 Stockholm International Film Festival.|$|E
500|$|When {{he started}} classes with this [...] "homemade" [...] knife, his {{instructors}} and fellow students {{were impressed with}} his handiwork {{and asked him to}} make knives for them. Emerson did so and sold these early butterfly knives for just the cost of materials, but he soon raised the price to $50 each, as demand for his knives increased. Emerson went on to make fixed-blade knives on a part-time basis, but upon seeing a Michael Walker handmade folding knife at a gun show, he was so impressed by the quality and design that he decided {{he was going to make}} folding pocketknives from that point on. Emerson contacted Walker and obtained his permission to use the Walker Linerlock mechanism on his own knives. [...] According to a 1990 article by Paul Basch, Emerson said of Walker, [...] "Here was a guy who put everything <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> into a knife. It was then I decided to start making knives seriously and locking liners in particular".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{included}} a guest appearance from Alexander Siddig, {{who played the}} [...] "Muslim hero" [...] Muhammed Ibhn Khaldun. Siddig was already well known as playing regular character Julian Bashir in [...] The producers viewed Siddig as a [...] "noble" [...] actor when he was playing the character. Siddig described the role as a [...] "godsend" [...] to him, because it enabled him to [...] "portray various aspects of an Arab man who was readily credible. He {{came out of a}} new identity <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for,</b> trying to take a snapshot of this guy before he disappears. He was my father. He was your father. He was the father of all the generations that had a liberal upbringing and didn't make a lot of money." [...] Roshan Seth played imam Fazul Azzam; he was cast because Brenton wanted him to appear in the episode. Meanwhile, Taahir Husain played the bomber Abu Hassan. The producers felt that the child actor was [...] "a find" [...] for them; it was his first television appearance, but they believed his performance [...] "carried it off." ...|$|E

500|$|In the Browns' early years, Paul Brown {{wanted to}} keep on reserve a number of {{promising}} players who {{did not make the}} team's official roster. McBride made this happen by putting the reserves on his payroll as taxi drivers, although none of them were asked to drive cabs. This group {{came to be known as}} the [...] "taxi squad", a term still in use to describe players kept on hand to fill in for injured team members. The taxi squad was just one of the ways in which McBride backed Brown. He viewed owning the team as primarily a civic duty – as a gift to the city. [...] "Cleveland has been good to me," [...] he said in a 1947 interview. [...] "I've made a great deal of money here. If <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a get-rich-quick investment, the last thing I'd do is buy a pro football club. It's a risky business.

500|$|Moondance was {{recorded}} from August to September 1969 at the Studio A penthouse of A & R Studios in New York City. It {{was the first}} album for which Morrison was credited as the producer; he later said [...] "no one knew what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> except me, so I just did it." [...] Around this time, the singer made it known to Warner Bros. {{that he would be}} lead production duties for all his future recordings, which forced producers recruited by the label into assisting roles. It also led to frequent enlisting and dismissal of musicians to meet Morrison's creative vision. Lewis Merenstein—Moondances executive producer—had brought in Astral Weeks session musicians Richard Davis, Jay Berliner, and Warren Smith, Jr. for the first recording session at A & R Studios, but Morrison—according to Platania—"sort of manipulated the situation" [...] and [...] "got rid of them all. For some reason he didn't want those musicians." [...] While not an overbearing presence among the record's personnel, the singer later conceded to creating an atmosphere of artistic autonomy during the sessions: [...] "When I go into the studio, I'm a magician. I make things happen. Whatever is working in that particular space at that particular time, I use, I take advantage of." ...|$|E

When asked by Howard Stern whether the bust was a publicity stunt, Roth said, [...] "Howard, in New York City this small of a bust is a $35 traffic citation. It literally says 'Buick, Chevy, Other'.
