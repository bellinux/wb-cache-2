40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} walkway length (5, 8 or 10 m) on measurements of comfortable and maximum walking speed. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: University-based rehabilitation centre. SUBJECTS: Patients (n[*]=[*] 25) with chronic stroke. METHODS: Timed walking with different walkway lengths (5, 8 and 10 m) walkways were recorded using a stop-watch. RESULTS: No significant effect of walkway length was found on either the comfortable or maximum walking speed in subjects with chronic stroke. For all walkway lengths, comfortable speed was significantly different from maximum speed (p[*]<[*] 0. 001).

Firstly the form of NURBS curve is analyzed and Talor's expansion of the parameter u with respect to time t is used to obtain the algorithm of the first order approximation interpolation. Secondly, based on the algorithm of the controlled chord error interpolator, an intelligent interpolation algorithm of the adaptive feedrate control is proposed.

Present study aims to analyze the deceleration behaviour of different vehicles types (like truck, car, motorized two and three-wheeler) on Nagpur-Mumbai Express Highway at Wardha, India.

Deceleration behaviour of different vehicle types is significantly different. Vehicles with higher maximum speed have higher deceleration time, <b>deceleration</b> <b>distance,</b> maximum and mean deceleration rates during their deceleration manoeuvre.

40|$|Intersection crashes average {{approximately}} 8, 500 fatal and 900, 000 injury accidents a year (1). At {{the onset}} of yellow at a high speed signalized intersection, a driver may encounter a region of the intersection approach, where they can neither stop safely nor be able to clear the intersection before the red indication. A wrong decision to stop when {{it would have been}} safer to proceed can lead to a severe rear-end collision. Conversely, a wrong decision to proceed through the intersection could lead to the driver running the red light and possibly causing a right angle collision. The traditional surrogate measure of safety, dilemma zone, denotes the region of risk but does not quantify the level of risk. Driver’s data was collected at five high speed intersections. A probit modeling technique was used to establish dilemma zone boundaries. Results revealed the effects of providing or lack of providing information. Specifically, the results indicate the effects AWFs have on the probability of stopping and perceived conflict curves. Sites providing information through PTSWF had earlier probability of stopping curves in particular Site 2 and Site 5 ’s probability of stopping curves were drastically different than the other studied sites. The risk associated with being downstream of the severe <b>deceleration</b> <b>distance</b> and upstream of the maximum passing distance was calculated for a variety of speeds at each intersection.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a multi-factorial {{experiment}} that was aimed at the following:(a) analyzing driver’s speed behavior while approaching zebra crossings under different conditions ofvehicle–pedestrian interaction and with respect to several safety measures and (b) comparing safetymeasures and identifying the most effective treatment for zebra crossings. Three safety countermea-sures at pedestrian crossings (curb extensions, parking restrictions and advanced yield markings) andthe condition of no treatment (baseline condition) were designed on a two-lane urban road and imple-mented in an advanced driving simulator. Several conditions of vehicle–pedestrian interaction (in termsof the time left for the vehicle to get to the zebra crossing at the moment the pedestrian starts the cross-ing) were also simulated. Forty-two drivers completed the driving in the simulator. Based on the recordedspeed data, two analyses were performed. The first analysis, which focused on the mean speed profiles, revealed that the driver’s speed behaviorwas affected by conditions of vehicle–pedestrian interaction and was fully consistent with previousfindings in the literature and with the Threat Avoidance Model developed by Fuller. Further analysis was based on variables that were obtained from the speed profiles of drivers (the speedat the beginning of the <b>deceleration</b> phase, the <b>distance</b> from the zebra crossing where the decelerationbegan, the minimum speed value reached during the <b>deceleration,</b> the <b>distance</b> from the pedestriancrossing where the braking phase ended and the average deceleration rate).

This conclusion was also confirmed by outcomes of the questionnaire on the counter-measure’s effectiveness. More than 80 % of the drivers perceived that the curb extensions were effective,which indicates that when this countermeasure was present, the drivers were more willing to yield andthat the visibility of the pedestrian crossing was better.

Thirteen young female soccer players (mean ± SD: age 16. 2 ± 1. 2 years, body mass 59. 3 ± 6. 6 kg, height 166. 2 ± 6. 5 cm and VO 2 max 45. 2 ± 1. 7 ml. kg. min- 1) participated and played 3 v 3 and 4 v 4 SSGs using two different length: width ratios for the pitch dimensions: 1 : 1 and 1 : 1. 3. Each game was played during regular training sessions for 4 × 4 min interspersed with 2 min of passive recovery, following a standardised warm-up. Heart rate (HR) response, time-motion outputs and technical performance was measured continuously throughout all games. The playing intensity during 3 v 3 SSGs was significantly greater (p < 0. 05) compared to 4 v 4 SSGs for mean HR (ES = 1. 51), work-rate (ES = 1. 24), efficiency index or Eff.

The 1 : 1 playing area resulted in significantly (p < 0. 05) larger work-rates (ES = 0. 54), Eff. Index (ES = 0. 78) and Player Load (ES = 0. 27) only compared to the 1 : 1. 3 playing area. Regarding the technical analysis, the players had an average of 1. 2 - 1. 5 involvements. min- 1 with no significant effect of player number or length: width ratio. The typical outcome of the players’ individual possessions was rated as being only ‘slightly effective’ in all game formats.

The length: width ratio had minimal influence on physical and technical outputs of players. However, player number during SSGs was influential for physiological and time-motion demands suggesting that it would be the more important variable to consider when prioritising physical development...|$|E
40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) can have devastating {{effects on the}} speech system {{resulting}} in a neuromotor speech disorder known as dysarthria. Due to the often widespread nature of the damage subsequent to the trauma, varying severity levels and types of dysarthria have been reported. As {{a result of the}} articulatory subsystem being affected the individual could sustain mild consonant imprecision to totally unintelligible speech. The speech literature to date has largely focused on dysarthria subsequent to severe traumatic brain injury. With the growing incidence of traumatic brain injury the world over, it has become necessary to also explore the effects of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) on the speech system. Conflicting evidence from neuropsychological investigations suggest that MTBI {{may or may not have}} persistent cognitive, linguistic effects up to one or two years post-injury. Speech and language disorders were considered as one of the prevalent symptoms reported amongst mildly injured TBI individuals. Previous investigations on dysarthric speech post-TBI have limited themselves largely to traditional subjective methods, invasive physiological instruments and/or restricted kinematic variables or speech tasks. Hence, the potential of the currently available dynamic physiological assessment methods, capable of tracking and recording once obscure lingual movements, has not been fully harnessed. With the use of convenient and sophisticated instrumentation like the Electromagnetic Articulograph (EMA) and Electropalatograph (EPG), alongside more traditional methods like perceptual speech sample analysis, a more complete and comprehensive investigation into the physiological basis of articulatory dynamics post-TBI can be undertaken. It is the view of the author that the articulatory kinematic spatial and temporal information provided by each of these instruments during dynamic speech tasks may supplement and/or complement the knowledge supplied by the other. Thus, a thorough understanding of the characteristics and underlying physiological bases of articulatory dysfunction post- TBI is possible. The primary aim of the thesis was to obtain comprehensive articulatory information regarding lingual movements towards, at and away from the palate during dynamic speech tasks of varying complexities by dysarthric speakers post-TBI using EMA and EPG. In Chapter 2, 10 individuals with severe TBI (mean age= 39. 58 years, SD= 14. 31) and six individuals with MTBI (mean age= 66. 33 years, SD= 6. 61) were assessed using the AG 100 EMA system (Carstens Medizinelektronik, GmbH, Germany), and compared alongside 14 non-neurologically impaired control speakers. Articulatory kinematic profiles for the control, MTBI and severe TBI groups were obtained using the AG 100 system whilst repeating sentence and syllable embedded [t] and [k] productions at a habitual rate and loudness level. A comprehensive range of articulatory kinematic parameters were included in the study namely mean maximum velocity, mean maximum acceleration, mean maximum <b>deceleration,</b> <b>distance</b> and duration. The result of the comprehensive kinematic analysis revealed a significant difference between the control and severe TBI groups for the [t] and [k] sentence and [t] syllable productions. The severe TBI group demonstrated difficulties with the generation of speed (acceleration), control of speed (deceleration) and speed per se (velocity). The MTBI group, which comprised two mildly dysarthric speakers and four individuals with no discernible dysarthria, were comparable to the control group with respect to the measured kinematic parameters for both the sentence and syllable tasks. One of the widely acknowledged factors of any group investigation involving dysarthric speakers post-TBI is the heterogeneous nature of the deficit. Congruent with previous reports, the group results of the present study were considered to mitigate the articulatory characteristics of individual participants. Additionally, the perceptual ratings of individual participants belonging to the MTBI group revealed just noticeable alterations in consonant precision and phoneme length, requiring a case by case discussion of individual kinematic and perceptual profiles. Hence, the focus of Chapter 3 was to document the characteristics and specific nature of articulatory kinematics in each of the 16 individuals who had survived a traumatic brain injury. The study highlighted the advantages of an analysis of individual participant articulatory movement data. The results of the case by case physiological data analysis supported the existence of differential impairment in individuals with dysarthria following MTBI and severe TBI for the syllable repetition task where the MTBI group demonstrated minimal impairments in the control of speed and range of lingual movements and the severe TBI group exhibited widespread alterations in speed, generation and control of speed, range of movements and duration. For the sentence productions, both the mild and severe TBI groups demonstrated impairments in speed, generation of speed, range of movements and duration for tongue-tip and tongue-back productions. These results may be the outcome of differing severity levels of TBI on speech for a simple task versus a complex task where both the severe and MTBI groups appeared to be similarly affected. Chapter 4 presented the results of an electropalatographic (EPG) investigation of 11 individuals who had survived a severe TBI (mean age = 36. 75 years, SD = 11. 02) and who displayed a range of dysarthria severity levels from mild to moderate-severe. Each participant was fitted with a custom-made artificial acrylic palate that recorded lingual palatal contact during target consonant production. The target consonants [t, s, f, l, n] in a V CV phonetic environment were produced and analysed during sentence production and syllable repetition at a habitual rate and loudness level. Comparison of temporal parameters namely approach phase, closure/constriction phase, release phase and overall consonant durations for each consonant and task between the control and TBI groups were carried out. The results confirmed the presence of timing disturbances in the dysarthric speakers post-TBI. The TBI group was found to exhibit prolonged durations of the various phases of consonant production, which were attributed to articulatory slowness, impaired speech motor control, accuracy and coordination of articulatory movements. For the spatial measurements, the location, pattern and amount of tongue-topalate contacts were derived from the frame of maximum contact for each target consonant. Quantitative analysis, as well as visual inspection of the tongue-to-palate contact diagrams, indicated spatial aberrations in dysarthric speech post-TBI. Both the spatial and temporal aberrations may have at least partially caused the perceptual judgment of articulatory impairments in the dysarthric speakers. A secondary focus of the thesis was to investigate the effects of altered speech rate and loudness manipulations on articulatory kinematics since these suprasegmental modifications form an integral part of dysarthria therapy. Modifying speech rate and loudness may not only provide a scientific basis for compensatory strategies in dysarthria management but may also reflect the integrity of the neuromotor system and the nature of the speech production deficit in dysarthric speakers post-TBI. Chapters 5 and 6, which describe the investigation of augmented speech rate and loudness on articulatory kinematics, comprised six dysarthric individuals (mean age= 32. 77 years, SD= 10. 80) post-severe TBI. These individuals were also selected on the basis that they had successfully completed both the EMA and EPG assessments. The participants were instructed to produce the target consonants [t] and [k] in the V CV phonetic environment during syllable and sentence repetitions as fast and as loud as possible for the rate and loudness investigations, respectively. Articulatory kinematic spatial and temporal comparisons were made across the habitual, fast and loud conditions within each participant group. Additionally, the fast and loud conditions were compared across the control and TBI groups in order to establish articulatory kinematic spatial and temporal differences between the two groups during speech tasks that are more effortful and are intended to tax the speech mechanism. In Chapter 5 the investigation into articulatory dynamics during speech rate manipulations revealed that the control group and TBI group selected different strategies for increasing rate. The control group demonstrated no effects of rapid rate on articulatory kinematics for sentence productions. However, for the syllable repetitions, reductions in movement displacement were observed for the control group. Based on previous literature, it appears that the control group were driven by the need to maintain articulatory precision for the sentence productions whereas the syllable repetitions were susceptible to articulatory undershoot. From the results of the TBI group it appears that they conformed to increasing articulatory effort and force for the [t] and [k] sentence and [t] syllable repetitions. The TBI group may have chosen to increase articulatory effort to preserve distinctiveness of phonetic segments in order to avoid articulatory undershoot. The fast rate comparisons across the control and TBI groups revealed that the TBI group had reduced overall rates of sentence and syllable production compared to the control group possibly reflecting a uniform slowness of articulatory movements. The investigation into the effects of altered loudness on EMA and EPG-derived articulatory kinematic spatial and temporal parameters (Chapter 6) revealed that the loudness effects on the sentence and syllable tasks for each group were varied. Loudness related scaling of articulatory movements was observed in both the control and TBI group for tasks that demonstrated a significant magnitude of loudness change in the absence of any reduction in rate. The TBI group who were consistently louder than the control group for all tasks demonstrated these effects for [t] and [k] sentence and [t] syllable repetitions. The [k] syllable repetitions displayed an interaction between reduced speech rate and increased speech loudness and hence retained articulatory kinematic profiles similar to the habitual condition. For the control group, only the [t] syllable repetitions, which presented as the loudest task amongst all other tasks, exhibited an upscaling of articulatory movements. A difference in the magnitude of loudness change may be partly responsible for these task related differences in articulatory kinematics for the control group. Across the two groups, a task based difference was observed such that only the syllable repetitions between the groups were significantly different. These task based differences were attributed to varying speech motor, phonetic and/or cognitive requirements across the two tasks. The experiments presented in this thesis served to provide valuable insights into the overall, as well as specific characteristics, of the underlying physiological bases of articulatory dysfunction in dysarthria following TBI...|$|E

Their tests {{found that the}} car's brakes could override a stuck accelerator and bring the car to a stop. Although the transmission downshifted and the engine continued to propel the car, stopping distance compared [...] "favorably to a normal panic stop on wet asphalt." [...] Edmunds.com did note that switching to neutral was the best option, given that average drivers may not press the brakes as firmly, and lighter presses will simply wear the brakes down. The German Commission on Technical Compliance (TÜV) of Rheinland also tested the stopping distance of Toyota iQ, Aygo, Yaris, Auris, Verso, Avensis and RAV4 models. With the accelerator purposely jammed to 80% of maximum speed, each vehicle was able to brake safely to a halt. The TÜV findings indicated that each model met the legal requirements for <b>deceleration</b> and stopping <b>distances,</b> and that all Toyota models tested had brakes which could override a stuck accelerator.|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} the movement demands of elite international Under- 20 age grade (U 20 s) and senior international rugby union players during competitive tournament match play. Forty elite professional players from an U 20 and 27 elite professional senior players from international performance squads were monitored using 10 Hz global positioning systems (GPS) during 15 (U 20 s) and 8 (senior) international tournament matches during the 2014 and 2015 seasons. Data on <b>distances,</b> velocities, accelerations, <b>decelerations,</b> high metabolic load (HML) distance and efforts, {{and number of}} sprints were derived. Data files from players who played over 60 min (n = 258) were separated firstly into Forwards and Backs, and more specifically into six positional groups; FR-Front Row (prop & hooker), SR-Second Row, BR-Back Row (Flankers & No. 8), HB-Half Backs (scrum half & outside half), MF-Midfield (centres), B 3 -Back Three (wings & full back) for match analysis. Linear mixed models revealed significant differences between U 20 and senior teams in both the forwards and backs. In the forwards the seniors covered greater HML distance (736. 4 ± 280. 3 vs 701. 3 ± 198. 7 m, p = 0. 01) and severe decelerations (2. 38 ± 2. 2 vs 2. 28 ± 1. 65, p = 0. 05) compared to the U 20 s, but performed less relative HSR (3. 1 ± 1. 6 vs 3. 2 ± 1. 5, p < 0. 01), moderate (19. 4 ± 10. 5 vs 23. 6 ± 10. 5, p = 0. 01) and high accelerations (2. 2 ± 1. 9 vs 4. 3 ± 2. 7, p < 0. 01) and sprint•min- 1 (0. 11 ± 0. 06 vs 0. 11 ± 0. 05, p < 0. 01). Senior backs covered a greater relative distance (73. 3 ± 8. 1 vs 69. 1 ± 7. 6 m•min- 1, p < 0. 01), greater High Metabolic Load (HML) distance (1138. 0 ± 233. 5 vs 1060. 4 ± 218. 1 m, p < 0. 01), HML efforts (112. 7 ± 22. 2 vs 98. 8 ± 21. 7, p < 0. 01) and heavy decelerations (9. 9 ± 4. 3 vs 9. 5 ± 4. 4, p = 0. 04) than the U 20 s backs. However, the U 20 s backs performed more relative HSR (7. 3 ± 2. 1 vs 7. 2 ± 2. 1, p < 0. 01) and sprint•min- 1 (0. 26 ± 0. 07 vs 0. 25 ± 0. 07, p < 0. 01). Further investigation highlighted differences between the 6 positional groups of the teams. The positional groups that differed the most on the variables measured were the FR and MF groups, with the U 20 s FR having higher outputs on HSR, moderate & high accelerations, moderate, high & severe <b>decelerations,</b> HML <b>distance,</b> HML efforts, and sprints•min- 1. For the MF group the senior players produced greater values for relative distance covered, HSR, moderate <b>decelerations,</b> HML <b>distance</b> and sprint•min- 1. The BR position group was most similar with the only differences seen on heavy accelerations (U 20 s higher) and moderate decelerations (seniors higher). Findings demonstrate that U 20 s internationals {{appear to be an}} adequate 'stepping stone' for preparing players for movement characteristics found senior International rugby, however, the current study highlight {{for the first time that}} certain positional groups may require more time to be able to match the movement demands required at a higher playing level than others.

40|$|We use astrometric, {{distance}} and spindown data on pulsars to: (1) estimate three-dimensional velocity components, birth distances from the galactic plane, and ages of individual objects; (2) determine {{the distribution of}} space velocities and the scale height of pulsar progenitors; (3) test spindown laws for pulsars; (4) test for correlations between space velocities and other pulsar parameters; and (5) place empirical requirements on mechanisms than can produce high velocity neutron stars. Our approach incorporates measurement errors, uncertainties in <b>distances,</b> <b>deceleration</b> in the Galactic potential, and differential galactic rotation. We find that the scale height of the progenitors is approximately 0. 13 kpc, that the 3 D velocities are distributed in two components with characteristic speeds of 175 (+ 20,- 30) km/s and 700 (+ 200,- 150) km/s representing 83 % and 17 % of the population respectively. These results are insensitive to the explicit relation of chronological and spindown ages. We infer that the most probable chronological ages are typically smaller than conventional spindown ages by factors as large as two.

40|$|We {{show for}} the first time images of solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) viewed using the Heliospheric Imager (HI) {{instrument}} aboard the NASA STEREO spacecraft. The HI instruments are wide-angle imaging systems designed to detect CMEs in the heliosphere, in particular, {{for the first time}}, observing the propagation of such events along the Sun Earth line, that is, those directed towards Earth. At the time of writing the STEREO spacecraft are still close to the Earth and the full advantage of the HI dual-imaging has yet to be realised. However, even these early results show that despite severe technical challenges in their design and implementation, the HI instruments can successfully detect CMEs in the heliosphere, and this is an extremely important milestone for CME research. For the principal event being analysed here we demonstrate an ability to track a CME from the corona to over 40 degrees. The time altitude history shows a constant speed of ascent over at least the first 50 solar radii and some evidence for <b>deceleration</b> at <b>distances</b> of over 20 degrees. Comparisons of associated coronagraph data and the HI images show that the basic structure of the CME remains clearly intact as it propagates from the corona into the heliosphere. Extracting the CME signal requires a consideration of the F-coronal intensity distribution, which can be identified from the HI data. Thus we present the preliminary results on this measured F-coronal intensity and compare these to the modelled F-corona of Koutchmy and Lamy (IAU Colloq. 85, 63, 1985). This analysis demonstrates that CME material some two orders of magnitude weaker than the F-corona can be detected; a specific example at 40 solar radii revealed CME intensities as low as 1. 7 × 10 [SUP]- 14 [/SUP] of the solar brightness. These observations herald a new era in CME research as we extend our capability for tracking, in particular, Earth-directed CMEs into the heliosphere. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The kinematics and speech moter stability of the tongue tip during the habitual and loud speech produced by eight nondysarthric participants with PD and eight age- and gender-matched non-neurologically imparted speakers were investigated using electromagnetic articulography. Sentences loaded with alveolar consonants were recorded in habitual and experimental-cued loudness conditions. Kinematic parameters (velocity, acceleration, <b>deceleration,</b> duration, and <b>distance)</b> were analyzed from word-initial/t/productions within repetitions of one sentence, while the spatiotemporal index, analyzed across repetitions of a second sentence, proved a quantitative measurement of the spatial and temporal stability of tongue tip movement. During habitual speech, there was no differences in kinematic parameters between groups. During loud speech, whereas particupants with PD increased maximum veloctiy, the control speakers increased the majority of kinematic parameters excluding durating and approach phase acceleration. The speech motor stability of the tongue tip was similar across groups during both speech conditions and was not affected by increased loudness. Clinical treatment implications are positive because loud speech can increase tongue tip movements without shifting speech moter stability despite the increased demand on the motor system...|$|R
40|$|Interplanetary-magnetic-field {{measurements}} made by Pioneers 9 and 10, HEOS 2, and Explorer 41 {{during early}} August 1972 are reviewed. It is {{noted that the}} two Pioneers were nearly radially aligned during the flare events, with Pioneer 9 {{at a distance of}} 0. 78 AU from the sun and Pioneer 10 at a distance of 2. 2 AU. The data obtained by Pioneer 9, Pioneer 10, and the two near-earth satellites are analyzed separately, and the major flare-associated shocks are identified. An attempt is made to identify corresponding shocks at the different locations and to determine their propagation velocities in the region between 0. 8 and 2. 2 AU. It is found that there was an obvious tendency for the average shock velocities to decrease with increasing radial distance from the sun and that the local velocities at the Pioneer locations were significantly smaller than the appropriate average values. A comparison of these local velocities indicates that there was a large deceleration of the shocks between the sun and some distance within 0. 8 AU but little, if any, <b>deceleration</b> beyond that <b>distance.</b> A plot of average shock velocities from the sun to 1. 0 AU as a function of longitude separation between the flares and Pioneer 9 is shown to suggest a pronounced deviation of the shock fronts from spherical symmetry...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{starts with}} {{depicting}} the test series {{carried out by}} the Transportation Active Safety Institute, with two cars equipped with pedestrian automatic emergency braking (AEB) systems. Then, an AEB analytical model that allows the prediction of the crash speed, stopping distance, and stopping time {{with a high degree of}} accuracy is presented. The model has been validated with the test results and can be used for real-time application due to its simplicity. The concept of the active safety margin is introduced and expressed in terms of <b>deceleration,</b> time, and <b>distance</b> in the model. This margin is a criterion that can be used either in the design phase of pedestrian AEB for real-time decision making or as a characteristic indicator in test procedures. Finally, the decision making is completed with the analysis of the behavior of the pedestrian lateral movement and the calculation of the certainty of finding the pedestrian into the crash zone. This model of certainty completes the analysis of decision making and leads to the introduction of the new concept of “critical speed for decision making. ” All major variables influencing the performance of pedestrian AEB have been modeled. A proposal of certainty scale in this kind of tests and a set of recommendations are given to improve the efficiency and accuracy of evaluation of pedestrian AEB systems...|$|R
40|$|Project {{conducted}} {{in cooperation with}} the Federal Highway Administration. Freeway ramp design speed criteria contained in current American Association of Highway and Transportation Official (AASHTO) and Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) design policies have been traced through roughly 50 years of technical literature. The evolution of design speed criteria has been documented and technical rational leading to periodic changes has been included. TxDOT ramp design speed criteria are, essentially, the AASHTO criteria. The origins of driver acceleration and deceleration rates, which are built into the AASHTO criteria, are experimental studies performed during the late thirties. Several studies have raised questions about the appropriateness of the AASHTO minimum allowable ramp design speed, which is 50 percent of the freeway design speed. Questions have also been raised about the adequacy of high-speed ramp lengths designed by AASHTO criteria. A conceptual data collection plan has been designed to provide information that will answer questions regarding current criteria. Additionally, a nationwide survey of ramp design agencies indicates that (1) there is a variety of different design policies; (2) most designers have concern for entrance ramps, as opposed to exits; and (3) safety is the most commonly used evaluation measure. 17.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{constructed}} for {{the evolution of}} an interstellar pickup ion distribution in the solar wind. The model assumes that the ions are immediately isotropized at ionization and follows the subsequent development of the distribution function as the particles are convected with the solar wind. The effects of energy diffusion in an ambient wave field with a power law spectrum, adiabatic deceleration in the expanding solar wind, and continual addition of newly ionized particles are all included in the model. An analytical expression describing the evolution of the distribution function in phase space velocity and heliocentric radius is obtained. The distribution quickly approaches an asymptotic shape in phase space which depends on the relative efficiency of the energy diffusion process compared to that of adiabatic <b>deceleration.</b> At large <b>distances</b> from the sun the density of pickup ions falls as 1 /r in this model. An expression for the distribution function at large distances and for large particle speed is presented. The asymptotic shape should describe the distribution of pickup ions in the outer heliosphere and could be used as an input distribution for a model of the anomalous component of heliosphere and could be used as an input distribution for a model of the anomalous component of cosmic rays. Comparison of this work with the recent observation of He(+) at 1 AU implies that the energy diffusion process is very weak inside 1 AU...|$|R
