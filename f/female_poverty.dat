50|$|Rates of female-headed {{households}} {{are on the}} rise in Ghana. The number of female-headed households who are either widowed or divorced has also risen over time. Contrary to worldwide findings that <b>female</b> <b>poverty</b> is correlated with higher rates of female-headed households, findings from the Ghana Living Standards Survey indicate that female-headed households may not actually experience higher poverty than male-headed households. This is because reasons that {{households are}} headed by females differ across the country. Marital status is a significant factor in understanding differences in poverty rates. For example, widows are the group of female-headed households that exhibit the highest rates of poverty. Especially in polygynous cases, not all women live in the same household as their husband. Therefore, female-headed households headed by married women are best-off in terms of poverty, followed by divorced females, and widowed females.|$|E

According to the Statistics of Higher Education of Malaysia Report 2010, more than 60 per cent of enrolments in Public Higher Education Institutions are female. Even though there are more female in tertiary education, but the wages for female employee are still lower compared to male employee.

While Malaysia has demonstrated successful reduction of poverty from more than 50 per cent in the 1970 s to 0. 6 per cent in 2014, there is no information on how <b>female</b> <b>poverty</b> has been affected over the years.

Our findings suggest that while both would reduce poverty among working women, the impact of a comparable worth policy on <b>female</b> <b>poverty</b> would be greater under most scenarios presented. It is estimated that an increase of 96 cents per hour in the national minimum wage would be necessary to equal the poverty reduction effect for women workers of a comparable worth policy which excludes small employers. Both policies decrease the incidence of povertylevel wages less among men, since roughly 60 percent of minimum wage workers are women. Additionally, not only would a national comparable worth policy improve the economic status of low-waged women workers, it would also narrow the gap between male and <b>female</b> <b>poverty.</b> While an increase in the minimum wage would also reduce this gap, comparable worth would virtually eliminate it.

40|$|A {{case study}} in the {{politics}} of social provision, this dissertation uncovers the origins of a legal dispute between directors of a charitable trust and its female beneficiaries during the Progressive Era. In 1919 the poor women of Brattleboro, Vermont, legatees of the Thomas Thompson Trust, sued the Boston-based charity for mismanagement and demanded increased benefits and a role in monitoring trust allocations. An examination of charity case records, legal testimony, and local resources reveals the roots of their collective action in the experience of getting help. At a time when reformers were reconstructing charity to accommodate the shift from a moral to scientific approach to poverty, the case reveals the gender and class relations that shaped social policy. ^ Highlighting the perspective of charity clients, the study shows how both providers and the needy constructed charity policy. Over the course of two decades, interaction among charity administrators, middle-class women, visiting nurses and poor, mostly native-born white women resulted in a medical definition of <b>female</b> <b>poverty.</b> Increased access to medical care and health education led beneficiaries to fashion a definition of female worthiness that combined recognition of their wage-earning with protection and support for ill health and old age. The shift from a moral to physical explanation of <b>female</b> <b>poverty</b> strengthened poor women 2 ̆ 7 s claims to direct relief while it encouraged charity administrators to develop health programs and to cultivate public support. Despite an alliance with civic leaders seeking local control over charitable funds, poor women failed to attain legal recognition of their claims, but they nonetheless modified trust policy. ^ The redefinition of <b>female</b> <b>poverty</b> as a medical problem bolstered women 2 ̆ 7 s sense of entitlement and expanded health services for the poor and working-class community. Improved access to health experts, however, did little to resolve poor women 2 ̆ 7 s economic difficulties and helped undermine their sense of self-sufficiency as they adapted to middle-class assumptions about female weakness and invalidity. ...|$|E

However, the improvement was brought about from the top down, without civil participation and control. Also, many legal and financial dispositions concerning the family, women and gender relations were fundamentally conservative. Such politics may {{not be seen as}} left-wing. The socialists never ana-lysed their mistakes in this respect, so that a consistent left-wing agenda on family and gender policy is still missing irrespective of whether they are in government or in opposition. Since the collapse of the old system, many new ‘right ’ trends have gained ground. Conservative trends are harming the reproductive rights of women and are question-ing the legitimacy of their work outside the home. Economic crisis and monetary pressures are leading to a wholesale reorganisation of former social policy disposi-tions, with a minimal state, the scaling down of universal and social insurance bene-fits, the spread of individually targeted social assistance and market or quasi-market solutions.

We use the term environmental factors to describe two distinct phenomena: local economic conditions, and neighborhood spillover effects. We measure local economic conditions using county the unemployment rate. We measure neighborhood spillover effects using the racial makeup and poverty rate of the county. To study the demographic, human capital, and county level effects on the average poverty spell length we use a matched PSID / Census sample that covers the period 1968 to 1989. We find that the average black poverty spell length is 16 months longer than the average white poverty spell. The average <b>female</b> headed household <b>poverty</b> spell is 9. 3 months longer that of male headed households. High School graduate households suffer 12 fewer months of poverty than dropout households. However, when we control for the demographic, human capital, and county level effects we find that relative high school graduate poverty spell falls by 85 percent (2 months), black poverty spells falls in half (7. 8 months), <b>female</b> headed households <b>poverty</b> spells falls by only 20 percent (7. 7 months). We consider the effect of a county’s unemployment rate, poverty rate and racial makeup on the length of a poverty spell. Of these three factors, the percentage of poor in a county has the largest effect. Moving an individual from one standard deviation below the mean poverty rate to one standard above the mean poverty rate (from the inner city to the suburbs) lowers the average poverty spell by 20 to 25 percent.
