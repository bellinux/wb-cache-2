40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to calculate the distribution of the tax burden across income levels in Spain between 1960 and 1990. The chosen period covers the final years of Franco’s dictatorship and the first ones of the present parliamentary regime, and is thus meant to explore how political change was reflected on taxation. Does transition entail a fiscal revolution? Here is one case study developed and compared to other national experiences. Effective tax reform seems to have been politically blocked during the dictatorship, with public budgets growing fundamentally on the grounds of social security contributions. Democracy brought about a comprehensive transformation starting in 1977, which aimed at improving fairness (progressivity) and increasing revenue (to fund the development of the Welfare State). In this work I analyse whether the reforms entailed effective changes in the distribution of the tax burden, by <b>imputing</b> <b>tax</b> collection to taxpayers, based on income and consumption micro-data from Household Budget Surveys. The results show a persistent (albeit decreasing) regressivity in the tax system, which caused an increasingly negative redistribution of income. Pre-Tax incomes grew unequal during the period and net incomes even more so as a result: the tax reform did not fulfill its equalizing promises. The joint effect of the fiscal system, however, seems to have been slightly positive due to progressive social spending...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of the {{enactment}} of the anti-thin capitalization rules on capital structure after the enactment of the anti-thin capitalization rules in Taiwan. According to the theoretical derivation, companies with lower shareholder <b>imputed</b> <b>tax</b> credits ratio tend to have greater debt-to-equity ratio, while companies with higher surtax on undistributed earnings ratio tend to have higher debt-to-equity ratio. This finding is consistent with the hypotheses of this study. However, the relationships between interest-bearing liability rate, marginal income tax rate and debt-to-equity ratios are uncertain. Using 2006 – 2012 sample data for the empirical study, this paper finds that enterprise’s total debt-to-equity ratios significantly decreases after the enactment of the anti-thin capitalization rules, and provisions preventing capital weakening have policy effectiveness. The shareholder <b>imputed</b> <b>tax</b> credits ratio and total debt-to-equity ratio are negatively correlated, while interest-bearing liability rate, marginal income tax rate, and surtax on undistributed earnings ratio, are positively correlated with total debt-to-equity ratio. This finding supports the hypotheses of this study. However, marginal income tax rate is lack of significance.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the redistributive effects of the personal income tax (PIT). Information on the PIT reported in the household survey substantially understates the real tax liability borne by households. The redistributive effects of the personal income tax would be undervalued if the information was used. In order to correct the underestimation of the PIT by non-reporting in our dataset, we apply the <b>tax</b> schedule and <b>impute</b> the <b>tax</b> liability for the individuals in our sample according to the components of their earned income. This <b>imputed</b> <b>tax</b> liability is used to calculate the MT index, the most commonly used measure of the redistributive effects of taxes and governmental subsidies, and to decompose the MT index into the effects of horizontal equity and vertical equity. The MT index and its decomposition show that the personal income tax does reduce inequality, but the effect is small and negligible. The low average personal income tax rate is the main reason why it fails to contribute more to improving inequality. グローバルCOEプログラム = Global COE Progra...|$|R

40|$|Tax expenditures, in {{the form}} of tax provisions, are {{government}} expenditures. They are conceptually and functionally distinct from those tax provisions whose purpose is to raise revenue. Tax expenditure programs are comparable to entitlement programs. Therefore, tax expenditures must be analyzed in spending terms and integrated into the budgetary process to ensure fiscal accountability. In addition, tax expenditures must be audited for performance and the information must be published (with comprehensive analysis) to ensure fiscal transparency. The author analyzes the concept and definition, size, and effects of tax expenditures, as well as the fiscal accountability and transparency of tax expenditure spending. In short, tax expenditures affect (1) the budget balance,(2) budget prioritization in allocation, (3) the effectiveness and efficiency of fiscal resources, and (4) the scope for abuse by taxpayers, government officials and legislators. While reviewing the current practices in tax expenditures against the requirements of fiscal accountability and transparency, she finds that this fiscal area must be strengthened. The author sketches four building blocks to strengthen tax expenditures toward fiscal accountability and transparency, based on the literature developed by Surry and McDaniel, the practices from industrial and developing countries, the Campos and Pradhan fiscal accountability model, and the International Monetary Fund's fiscal transparency code. The author argues that normative/benchmark tax structure, a revenue-raising component of the tax system, should be formalized. The normative/benchmark tax structure should be legally defined in the tax law and should be transparent. The tax receipts from this normative/benchmark tax structure should be quantified and published. Presently, many countries could publish <b>imputed</b> <b>tax</b> revenue from normative/benchmark tax structures because such data is available. Only if <b>imputed</b> <b>tax</b> revenue is published {{in the same way as}} the other budget components-tax revenue received, tax expenditures, direct expenditures, and fiscal balance-will a budget system be truly transparent in terms of revenue-raising activities and expenditure activities. In addition, when the tax revenue-raising activity is formalized, the inherent spending nature of tax expenditures is further exposed. Therefore, tax expenditures should be added to direct expenditures forming total government expenditures. Furthermore, the conventional concept of the size of government should be remedied by including both direct expenditures and tax expenditures.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} studying the distributional consequences of corporate <b>tax</b> changes by <b>imputing</b> to individual <b>tax</b> returns {{the net effect of}} changes in effective corporate tax rates. Particular attention is given to the difference between nominal and real capital income, to the problem of corporate pension funds, and to the automatic effect of corporate tax changes on dividends and retained earnings. Application of this imputation method to the tax changes enacted in 1986 shows that the actual distribution of the total tax change was very different from the traditional distribution of only the personal income tax change. The net <b>imputed</b> corporate <b>tax</b> increase was equivalent to a rise of 6 percentage points in the personal income tax among taxpayers with 1988 incomes over $ 200, 000 and 4 percentage points among taxpayers with incomes between $ 100, 000 and $ 200, 000. The corporate income tax increase also added the equivalent of an 8 percent rise in the income tax for taxpayers with incomes between $ 10, 000 and $ 20, 000. By contrast, for middle income taxpayers (with incomes between $ 30, 000 and $ 75, 000) the corporate tax increase was equivalent to an income tax rise of only 1 or 2 percent. The analysis shows that the higher corporate tax re{{presents a}} particularly large increase for taxpayers over the age of 65; on average, tax returns with at least one taxpayer over age 65 will pay 12 percent more tax under the 1986 tax legislation than they would otherwise have paid.

In order to calculate the level of subsidies the actual user cost is compared with a benchmark cost. Regarding tax expenditure, the benchmark is the generally accepted tax system. Concerning owner-occupiers the discussed subsidies are the mortgage tax relief, the reduced VAT rate for renovation, the reduced transfer tax rate and the <b>imputed</b> rent <b>tax</b> reduction. With regard to the rental sector, social housing and the housing allowance are the subsidy schemes at stake. The results show that the tax advantages are mainly received by the 40 per cent highest incomes. The reductions on property tax and transaction costs are to a lesser extent directed at higher incomes, since they include a condition of modest housing. The subsidies in the rental sector for the most part go to the two bottom income quintiles. Overall, the average owner-occupier receives four times more than the average tenant. status: publishe...|$|R

Full integration, under which corporate-source income would be taxed only to shareholders, has significant economic advantages, but it suffers from severe practical difficulties.

The proper treatment of tax preferences and international flows of corporate-source income raise important issues of tax administration and public policy.

Beyond that, "stacking rules" are required for the presumptive allocation of dividends between preference and taxable income.

As the tax treatment of housing will disproportionately create tax savings for the top deciles of the income distribution, we quantify how the tax deductibility contributes to the heavily skewed distribution of wealth in the United States using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. Although the tax treatment of owner occupied housing alone is unlikely to produce the extreme wealth concentration at the far right tail of the distribution, we argue that it is re-enforced by a bequest motive.
