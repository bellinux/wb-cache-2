40|$|Considering the {{importance}} of medication quality control and that mouthrinses for dental caries prevention have commonly been prepared in <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacies,</b> this study assessed formulations containing 0. 05 % NaF acquired from 6 <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacies</b> {{in the city of}} Piracicaba, S. P. The mouthrinse formulations were purchased in 3 separate periods and coded from A to F. Fluoride ion (F-) concentration was determined in all formulations in the 3 periods, and in those acquired in the 3 rd period, the bioavailability of fluoride with dental enamel with caries-like lesions and the pH of products were evaluated. A solution of 0. 05 % NaF and distilled deionized water were used, respectively, as positive and negative controls. In the bioavailability analysis, fluoride present in dental enamel was determined removing, by acid etching, two layers of enamel; fluoride in the acid extract was determined with a specific electrode. The mouthrinses prepared in 5 pharmacies presented a F- concentration close to the expected value, except for the product prepared in one of them, in which a mean of 0. 01 % NaF was found. All products were more efficient than the negative control (p< 0. 05) in terms of reactivity with dental enamel, but differences among them were observed with regard to the positive control (p< 0. 05). The data suggest that a quality control program should be implemented in <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacies</b> to guarantee the quality of fluoridated mouthrinses formulated...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} {{the validity of}} electronic hospital <b>pharmacy</b> <b>dispensing</b> records {{as an indicator of}} late gestation exposure to antidepressants using medical records as the gold standard. Method:Medical records (gold standard) were reviewed for a consecutive sample of 400 women who delivered at a large maternity hospital during 2005. Data on antidepressants used in pregnancy from the medical records were compared with the electronic <b>pharmacy</b> <b>dispensing</b> records to ascertain sensitivity and specificity. Results: According to the medical records, 12 (3 %) women were identified as taking antidepressants during late gestation. The electronic <b>pharmacy</b> <b>dispensing</b> records correctly identified 9 women as exposed to antidepressants (sensitivity score 75 %; 95 %CI 43 – 95). No women were classified as exposed according to <b>pharmacy</b> <b>dispensing</b> records and classified as not exposed according to the medical records (specificity score 100 %; 95 %CI 99 – 100). 7 (1. 8 %) women were identified in the medical records as taking antidepressants but had either stopped prior to pregnancy or on finding out that they were pregnant. These patients were not identified in the <b>pharmacy</b> <b>dispensing</b> records. Conclusion: Electronic hospital <b>pharmacy</b> <b>dispensing</b> records may provide an efficient alternative to paper records for identifying late gestation exposure to antidepressants, but will underestimate the exposure by 25 %. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of a tablet counter (also known as a pill counter or drug counter) is to {{accurately}} count prescription medications in tablet or capsule form to aid the requirement for patient medication safety, to increase efficiency and reduce costs for the typical pharmacy. Newer versions of this counting device include advanced software to continue to improve safety for the patient who is receiving the prescription, ensuring that the pharmacy staff dispense the right medication at correct dosage strength for the right patient. (see also medication safety). Today’s pharmacy industry recognizes the need for heightened vigilance against medication errors across the entire spectrum. A wealth of {{research has been conducted}} regarding the prevalence of medication errors and the ability of technology to decrease or eliminate such errors. (See the March 2003 landmark study by Auburn University’s Center for Pharmacy Operations and Designs). Prescription dispensing safety and accuracy in the pharmacy are an essential part of ensuring the right patient gets the right medication at the right dosage. A trend in pharmacy is to place a greater reliance on technology and pharmacy automation to minimize the chance of human error and speed up the process of <b>dispensing.</b> <b>Pharmacy</b> management generally sees technology as a solution to industry challenges like staffing shortages, prescription volume increases, long and hectic work hours and complicated insurance reimbursement procedures. Instead of adding more staff, pharmacies employ advanced technologies that help to handle an ever-escalating number of prescriptions, while making dispensing safer and more precise.|$|E

One has to keep pace with ever changing needs of the students and changing trends. So this study is designed to know the perceptions and alternative suggestions of MBBS students regarding <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacy</b> and animal experiments and use them to improve teaching. Methods: 177 MBBS students studying at Bangalore medical college who have completed their university examination in pharmacology subject were included in this questionnaire based study. The data was analysed using descriptive statistics. Results: Majority of the students disfavoured <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacy</b> (82 %) and animal experiments (73 %) in undergraduate practical pharmacology. 78 % of the students preferred computer assisted learning (CAL) as an alternative to animal experiments. Some of the clinical pharmacology exercises favoured by students, as an alternative to <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacy</b> were, drug station (clinical station) with real cases in hospital (88 %), module on various drug formulations (74 %), module on pharmacovigilance (74 %), problem based exercises (73 %), drug administration procedures (68 %), drug dosage calculations (68 %), pharmacoeconomic exercises (66 %), prescription writing and criticism of prescription (62 %), short term research project (44 %) and so on. Conclusions: Computer assisted learning seems to be a better alternative to animal experiments.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the relationship between sociodemographic factors and <b>pharmacy</b> <b>dispensing</b> of medications for erectile dysfunction (ED) in the general population of middle-aged and elderly men. By considering a number of medical conditions that could promote or contraindicate use of ED medication, the analysis could help capture prescription patterns that might not be explained by medical needs. METHODS: Individual-level <b>pharmacy</b> <b>dispensing</b> data from 2006 for a population-based cohort of 216, 148 men aged 45 - 79 years in the county Scania, Sweden, were analysed. Multiple logistic regression was applied, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to quantify the discriminatory accuracy (DA) of the associations. National trends in <b>pharmacy</b> <b>dispensing</b> of ED medication between 2006 and 2016 were also analysed. RESULTS: <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>dispensing</b> of ED medication increased between 2006 and 2016, particularly among men aged 65 - 79 years (from 6. 8 to 9. 2 %). Dispensing of ED medication was positively associated with higher socioeconomic position, and divorced and widowed men were more likely to fill a prescription with ED medication than married men. These associations remained after adjusting for medical conditions. The DA of the associations was, however, rather low (AUC = 0. 69 among 45 - 64 year olds and AUC = 0. 65 among 65 - 79 year olds). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>dispensing</b> of ED medication seem linked to the individuals socioeconomic position, age and marital status suggesting sociodemographic disparities in the <b>pharmacy</b> <b>dispensing</b> targeting sexual function.

We evaluated the extent of switching among equivalents in chronic cardiovascular therapies, {{the influence of the}} 2012 regulatory intervention and of patient-related or drug-related factors. Prescription of off-patent antiarrhythmics, oral antidiabetics, and ACE-inhibitors dispensed from August 2011 to August 2013 within the Bologna Local Health Authority (870, 000 inhabitants) were collected. The rate of actual switching among equivalents was evaluated monthly. The effect of the regulatory intervention was estimated by interrupted time series analysis. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of switching were calculated for: age, gender, number of different equivalents available for each drug, change in <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacy</b> between subsequent refills. The average monthly rates of switches were 9. 6 %, 16. 3 %, and 16. 3 % for antiarrhythmics, antidiabetics, and ACE-inhibitors, respectively. Values significantly increased soon after the regulatory intervention for ACE-inhibitors (+ 1. 81 %, p= 0. 00), antiarrhythmics (+ 1. 46 %, p= 0. 01) and antidiabetics (+ 1. 09 %, p= 0. 01), and no significant decreasing trends were observed in the following 12 months. For all drug classes, odd of switching was higher in case of change in <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacy</b> (up to aOR= 4. 31, 95 CI= 4. 26 - 4. 35 for ACE-inhibitors) and availability of ≥ 5 different equivalents (up to aOR= 7. 82, 95 CI= 7. 39 - 8. 28 for antidiabetics).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} (a) {{whether the}} risk of a potentially inappropriate drug combination (PIDC) increases with the number of physicians involved in the medical management of an elderly patient and (b) whether {{the risk of}} a PIDC is reduced if a patient has a single primary care physician or a single <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacy,</b> or both. DESIGN: Cross-sectional retrospective provincial database study. PARTICIPANTS: A regionally stratified random sample of 51, 587 elderly medicare registrants in Quebec who (a) visited at least one physician in 1990, (b) were not living in a health care institution for the entire year and (c) had been dispensed at least one prescription for a cardiovascular drug, a psychotropic drug or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). OUTCOME MEASURES: Information on all physician visits and drugs dispensed during 1990. Physician claims were used to identify the number of physicians involved in a patient's management and whether the patient had one primary care physician. Prescription claims were used to identify the number of PIDCs, prescribing physicians and dispensing pharmacies. RESULTS: The prevalence of PIDCs ranged from 4. 0 % (among those in the NSAID group) to 20. 3 % (among those in the psychotropic drug group). Of the PIDCs identified, 17. 6 % to 25. 8 % resulted from contemporaneous prescribing by different physicians. The number of prescribing physicians was the most important risk factor for a PIDC in all drug groups (odds ratio [OR] 1. 44 to 1. 71). The presence of a single primary care physician lowered the risk for cardiovascular and psychotropic PIDCs (OR 0. 70 and 0. 79 respectively) but not for NSAID PIDCs (OR 0. 94). The use of a single <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacy</b> lowered {{the risk of a}} PIDC in all drug groups (OR 0. 68 to 0. 79). CONCLUSION: The greater the number of physicians prescribing medications for an elderly patient, the greater is the risk that the patient will receive a PIDC. A single primary care physician and a single <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacy</b> may be "protective" factors in preventing PIDCs...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the recording of drug sensitivities of elderly care home residents, to describe the nature of sensitivities and to identify and describe discrepancies in the documentation of drug sensitivity status in general practices, pharmacies and care homes. METHODS: A random sample of residents within a purposive sample of care homes (nursing and residential) was selected. A clinical pharmacist inspected the GP medical record, the medicines administration record, and the care home record for each resident to identify drug sensitivities and discrepancies between records and to describe the nature of the recorded sensitivities. RESULTS: The records of 121 residents in 31 care homes were studied. Thirty-one (26 %) residents had at least one documented drug sensitivity in one of the sources inspected, with 48 sensitivities in total recorded. There was no description {{of the nature of the}} sensitivities recorded in 39 / 48 (81 %) cases. The number of sensitivities recorded on the medicines administration record, care home record and the GP record were 3 (6 %), 29 (60 %) and 35 (73 %), respectively. Only two sensitivities were simultaneously recorded on all three records. CONCLUSIONS: It was of concern that over 90 % of drug sensitivities were not recorded on the medicines administration record which is the final checking document when administering medication. The reason for this was that the <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacy</b> was responsible for generating the medicines administration record; however, drug sensitivity status is seldom shared between the GP and the <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacy.</b> Printing sensitivities on prescriptions would help to resolve this...|$|E
