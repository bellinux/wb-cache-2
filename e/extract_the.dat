5|$|There {{are several}} types of plant oils, {{distinguished}} by the method used to <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> oil from the plant. The relevant part of the plant may be placed under pressure to <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> oil, giving an expressed (or pressed) oil. The oils included in this list are of this type. Oils may also be extracted from plants by dissolving parts of plants in water or another solvent. The solution may {{be separated from the}} plant material and concentrated, giving an extracted or leached oil. The mixture may also be separated by distilling the oil away from the plant material. Oils extracted by this latter method are called essential oils. Essential oils often have different properties and uses than pressed or leached vegetable oils. Finally, macerated oils are made by infusing parts of plants in a base oil, a process called liquid-liquid extraction.|$|E

5|$|Each sensory system {{begins with}} {{specialized}} receptor cells, such as light-receptive neurons in the retina of the eye, or vibration-sensitive neurons in the cochlea of the ear. The axons of sensory receptor cells travel into {{the spinal cord}} or brain, where they transmit their signals to a first-order sensory nucleus dedicated to one specific sensory modality. This primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher-order sensory areas that are dedicated to the same modality. Eventually, via a way-station in the thalamus, the signals are sent to the cerebral cortex, where they are processed to <b>extract</b> <b>the</b> relevant features, and integrated with signals coming from other sensory systems.|$|E
