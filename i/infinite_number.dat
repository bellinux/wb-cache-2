5|$|Any nonrational {{power of}} a complex number has an <b>infinite</b> <b>number</b> of {{possible}} values because of the multi-valued nature of the complex logarithm. The principal value is a single value chosen from these by a rule which, amongst its other properties, ensures powers of complex numbers with a positive real part and zero imaginary part give the same value as does the rule defined above for the corresponding real base.|$|E

He determined {{one of the}} principal features of the infinite set: since a man and a finger have an <b>infinite</b> <b>number</b> of parts as do the universe and a man, it cannot be said that a man has more parts than his finger, nor that the universe has more parts than a man.|$|E
5|$|For random {{walks in}} -dimensional integer lattices, George Pólya {{published}} in 1919 and 1921 work, {{where he studied}} {{the probability of a}} symmetric random walk returning to a previous position in the lattice. Pólya showed that a symmetric random walk, which has an equal probability to advance in any direction in the lattice, will return to a previous position in the lattice an <b>infinite</b> <b>number</b> of times with probability one in one and two dimensions, but with probability zero in three or higher dimensions.|$|E
60|$|There are two respects {{in which}} the <b>infinite</b> <b>numbers</b> that are known differ from finite numbers: first, <b>infinite</b> <b>numbers</b> have, while finite numbers have not, a {{property}} which I shall call reflexiveness; secondly, finite <b>numbers</b> have, while <b>infinite</b> <b>numbers</b> have not, a property which I shall call inductiveness. Let us consider these two properties successively.|$|R
60|$|But {{beyond all}} these numbers, {{there are the}} <b>infinite</b> <b>numbers,</b> and <b>infinite</b> <b>numbers</b> do not have all {{inductive}} properties. Such numbers, therefore, may be called non-inductive. All those properties of numbers which are proved by an imaginary step-by-step process from one number to the next are liable to fail {{when we come to}} <b>infinite</b> <b>numbers.</b> The first of the <b>infinite</b> <b>numbers</b> has no immediate predecessor, because there is no greatest finite number; thus no succession of steps from one number to the next will ever reach from a finite <b>number</b> to an <b>infinite</b> one, and the step-by-step method of proof fails. This is another reason for the supposed self-contradictions of <b>infinite</b> <b>numbers.</b> Many of the most familiar properties of numbers, which custom had led people to regard as logically necessary, are in fact only demonstrable by the step-by-step method, and fail to be true of <b>infinite</b> <b>numbers.</b> But so soon as we realise the necessity of proving such properties by mathematical induction, and the strictly limited scope of this method of proof, the supposed contradictions are seen to contradict, not logic, but only our prejudices and mental habits.|$|R

5|$|Matrices {{which have}} a single row are called row vectors, and those {{which have a}} single column are called column vectors. A matrix which has {{the same number of}} rows and columns is called a square matrix. A matrix with an <b>{{infinite}}</b> <b>number</b> of rows or columns (or both) is called an infinite matrix. In some contexts, such as computer algebra programs, it is useful to consider a matrix with no rows or no columns, called an empty matrix.|$|E
5|$|The Greek philosopher Zeno {{considered}} {{the problem of}} summing an infinite series to achieve a finite result, but rejected it as an impossibility: the result was Zeno's paradox. Later, Aristotle proposed a philosophical resolution of the paradox, but the mathematical content was apparently unresolved until taken up by Archimedes, {{as it had been}} prior to Aristotle by the Presocratic Atomist Democritus. It was through Archimedes's method of exhaustion that an <b>infinite</b> <b>number</b> of progressive subdivisions could be performed to achieve a finite result. Liu Hui independently employed a similar method a few centuries later.|$|E
5|$|The {{mathematical}} {{concept of}} a Hilbert space, named after David Hilbert, generalizes the notion of Euclidean space. It extends the methods of vector algebra and calculus from the two-dimensional Euclidean plane and three-dimensional space to spaces with any finite or <b>infinite</b> <b>number</b> of dimensions. A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured. Furthermore, Hilbert spaces are complete: there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used.|$|E

In this work Archimedes uses infinitesimals, and shows how breaking up a figure into an <b>infinite</b> <b>number</b> of infinitely small parts can be used to determine its area or volume. Archimedes may have considered this method lacking in formal rigor, so he also used the method of exhaustion to derive the results.

5|$|After judicious self-experiments, Shulgin enlisted a {{small group}} of friends with whom he {{regularly}} tested his creations, starting in 1960. They developed a systematic way of ranking the effects of the various drugs, known as the Shulgin Rating Scale, with a vocabulary to describe the visual, auditory and physical sensations. He personally tested hundreds of drugs, mainly analogues of various phenethylamines (family containing MDMA, mescaline, and the 2C* family), and tryptamines (family containing DMT and psilocin). There are a seemingly <b>infinite</b> <b>number</b> of slight chemical variations, which can produce variations in effect — some pleasant and some unpleasant, depending on the person, substance, and situation — all of which are meticulously recorded in Shulgin's lab notebooks.

5|$|Some of the {{properties}} that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, meaning {{that there is no}} predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically <b>infinite</b> <b>number</b> of combinations.|$|E

5|$|There are an <b>infinite</b> <b>number</b> {{of other}} {{intermediate}} processes {{in which more}} and more photons are absorbed and/or emitted. For each of these possibilities there is a Feynman diagram describing it. This implies a complex computation for the resulting probability amplitudes, but provided {{it is the case}} that the more complicated the diagram the less it contributes to the result, {{it is only a matter}} of time and effort to find as accurate an answer as one wants to the original question. This is the basic approach of QED. To calculate the probability of any interactive process between electrons and photons it is a matter of first noting, with Feynman diagrams, all the possible ways in which the process can be constructed from the three basic elements. Each diagram involves some calculation involving definite rules to find the associated probability amplitude.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{counting}} {{the number of}} solutions to different types of Apollonius' problem belongs to the field of enumerative geometry. The general number of solutions for each of the ten types of Apollonius' problem is given in Table1 above. However, special arrangements of the given elements may change the number of solutions. For illustration, Apollonius' problem has no solution if one circle separates the two (Figure11); to touch both the solid given circles, the solution circle would have to cross the dashed given circle; but that it cannot do, if it is to touch the dashed circle tangentially. Conversely, if three given circles are all tangent at the same point, then any circle tangent at the same point is a solution; such Apollonius problems have an <b>infinite</b> <b>number</b> of solutions. If any of the given circles are identical, there is likewise an infinity of solutions. If only two given circles are identical, there are only two distinct given circles; the centers of the solution circles form a hyperbola, as used in one solution to Apollonius' problem.|$|E
