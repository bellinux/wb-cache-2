25|$|A verse {{narrative}}, as {{one might}} expect, is simply a narrative poem, a poem that tells a story. What is <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> subgenre is that owing to {{its place in the}} flexible category of long poem, the verse-narrative may have disrupted convention by telling its story in both poem and narrative. This combination broadens the scope of both genres, lending the poem's depth that may be lacking in the other subgenres, yet also a lyrical voice that defines it as poetry. For an example of this, one might turn to Gilgamesh, which encompasses both the subgenres Epic and Verse-Narrative.|$|E
25|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this approach}} is that it is trivial, based on the trivial observation that mathematics is a human activity. To observe that rigorous proof comes only after unrigorous conjecture, experimentation and speculation is true, but it is trivial and no-one would deny this. So it's a bit of a stretch to characterize a philosophy of mathematics in this way, on something trivially true. The calculus of Leibniz and Newton was reexamined by mathematicians such as Weierstrass in order to rigorously prove the theorems thereof. There is nothing special or <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> as it fits in with the more general trend of unrigorous ideas which are later made rigorous. There needs to be a clear distinction between the objects of study of mathematics and the study of the objects of study of mathematics. The former doesn't seem to change a great deal; the latter is forever in flux. The latter is what the social theory is about, and the former is what Platonism et al. are about.|$|E
500|$|... what is <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> film, perhaps, is {{the moment}} when it was made. It was shot between Munich and the war, and I shot it {{absolutely}} impressed, absolutely disturbed {{by the state of}} mind of a part of French society, a part of English society, a part of world society. And {{it seemed to me that}} a way of interpreting this state of mind, to the world hopefully, was not to talk of that situation, but tell a frivolous story. I looked for inspiration to Beaumarchais, to Marivaux, to the classical authors of comedy.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers' {{opinions}} on the graphics and gameplay were largely negative, while {{opinions on}} the title's music varied. The background music was described as [...] "...the only thing that is remotely <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> appallingly tedious game..." [...] by Popular Computing Weeklys reviewer. He followed this by stating [...] "At first it sounds all right, if a little monotonous, then it begins to grate the nerves. After a while it begins to take on all {{the appeal of the}} Chinese water torture." [...] Crash magazine's three reviewers were more positive about the music, stating [...] "The sound is fairly well done...", [...] "The title screen plays a nice tune..." [...] and [...] "...the game's drawing point is the sound..." [...] The game's graphics were described as [...] "fairly crude", [...] "unattractive" [...] and [...] "...none too exciting, consisting of colourful but flickery characters." [...] One reviewer stated [...] "The graphics are large and colourful but {{there is a lot of}} character clash..." [...] Overall impressions of Moonlight Madness were negative. Crash magazine's reviewers compared the game unfavourably to Booty. One expressed disappointment because of Bubble Bus' history of releasing [...] "great arcade/adventures". Your Sinclairs reviewer stated [...] "Maybe Bubble Bus had a touch of Moonlight Madness when it picked this one for its new release." [...] The reviewer from ZX Computing stated [...] "Keeping to the boy scout theme, be prepared before you buy this one." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Milestones: The Music and Times of Miles Davis, Chambers {{writes of}} Davis's segment and the complex {{production}} of [...] "Go Ahead John", [...] "In {{spite of the}} gimmickry, the blues segment manages to state some old verities in a new context, and state them powerfully. Most jazz listeners can hope that someday Go Ahead John will be unscrambled and re-presented to them as, among other things, an unhurried blues by Davis accompanied only by Holland". Down Beat critic John Ephland interprets the recording to be [...] "Miles' most obvious allusion to the Godfather of Soul, James Brown", adding that [...] "Conjuring up images of Brown's 'I Can't Stand Myself' and 'I Got the Feelin',' from '67 and '68, respectively, 'Go Ahead John' shuffles, swirls, gets down and runs rampant, with some very creative editing, courtesy of producer Teo Macero". Allmusic editor Thom Jurek writes of the recording, [...] "There is no piano. What's most <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> date is how it prefigures what would become 'Right Off' from Jack Johnson. It doesn't have the same fire, nor does it manage to sustain itself for the duration, {{but there are some}} truly wonderful sections in the piece". In Running the Voodoo Down: The Electric Music of Miles Davis, Phil Freeman calls the recording [...] "one of the best things Miles and Macero created during the 1970s", writing that [...] "It's a singular achievement in production, one that presents Miles in a different light than anything else in his catalog".|$|E
60|$|He {{resumed his}} seat, and {{conversation}} languished {{between the two}} men. The Englishman sat with knitted eyebrows, watching the people pass backward and forward, with an absent, puzzled look in his blue eyes. He had an indistinct recollection of having been told something <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> man {{at the time of}} their introduction. He was notorious for something. What was it? His memory seemed utterly to fail him. He could only remember that, for some reason or other, Leonardo di Marioni had been considered a very interesting figure in Roman society during his brief stay at the capital, and that he had vanished from it quite suddenly.|$|E

60|$|Gentlemen, you are aware, are apt {{to impart}} these {{imprudent}} confidences to ladies concerning their unfavorable opinion of sister fair ones. That {{is why so many}} women have the advantage of knowing that they are secretly repulsive to men who have self-denyingly made ardent love to them. And hardly anything could be more distinctively characteristic of Lucy than that she both implicitly believed what Stephen said, and was determined that Maggie should not know it. But you, who have a higher logic than the verbal to guide you, have already foreseen, as the direct sequence to that unfavorable opinion of Stephen's, that he walked down to the boathouse calculating, by the aid of a vivid imagination, that Maggie must give him her hand at least twice in consequence of this pleasant boating plan, and that a gentleman who wishes ladies to look at him is advantageously situated when he is rowing them in a boat. What then? Had he fallen in love with this surprising daughter of Mrs. Tulliver at first sight? Certainly not. Such passions are never heard of in real life. Besides, he was in love already, and half-engaged to the dearest little creature in the world; and he was not a man to make a fool of himself in any way. But when one is five-and-twenty, one has not chalk-stones at one's finger-ends that the touch of a handsome girl should be entirely indifferent. It was perfectly natural and safe to admire beauty and enjoy looking at it,--at least under such circumstances as the present. And there was really something very <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> girl, with her poverty and troubles; it was gratifying to see the friendship between the two cousins. Generally, Stephen admitted, he was not fond of women who had any peculiarity of character, but here the peculiarity seemed really of a superior kind, and provided one is not obliged to marry such women, why, they certainly make a variety in social intercourse.|$|E

5000|$|DraÅ¾etice, a {{place in}} the Czech Republic.

50|$|One <b>interesting</b> thing <b>about</b> <b>this</b> ball is {{that even}} though it is a German {{organized}} ball, the Caller announces the steps entirely in French.

50|$|Another <b>interesting</b> thing <b>about</b> <b>this</b> {{place is}} that water seeps into this temple {{from the four}} walls on an {{everyday}} basis.
