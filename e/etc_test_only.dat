40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{results of}} small-scale feasibility tests concerning fragmentation of HTR fuel particles {{in view of}} their reprocessing and/or separation from their coatings to reduce the waste volume. Tests were performed on small amounts of surrogate fuel particles originally received from CEA France for characterization purposes. Experiments were successfully carried out using standard TIG welding equipment. An acetylene torch test was also conducted. The investigated parameters included: AC/DC, voltage, current, exposure time, electrode type, electrode size, crucible shape <b>etc.</b> In most <b>tests,</b> <b>only</b> 20 new surrogate particles were submitted to an electric arc. After exposure, the intact particles, intact kernels and debris were counted {{and the number of}} broken particles was used as performance indicator. Conditions were identified, which fragmented 100 % of the treated particles. The energy consumption of the process is small. Three failure mechanisms are suspected, namely thermomechanical fragmentation of the SiC coating followed by oxidation of the graphite coatings, and eruption of molten kernel material from a particle. The process would require some further work to qualify it for higher material streams and other aspects of industrial relevance. These tests cannot currently be performed due to the unavailability of sufficient amounts of surrogate particles. JRC. F. 3 -High Flux and Future Reactor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{rule-based}} SCR {{control strategy}} is developed for a 5 % biodiesel fueled heavy-diesel engine. The control {{objective is to}} reduce the tail-pipe NOx emission while minimizing the urea dosage in a reliable fashion. A total of 32 runs of experimental test in ESC and ETC driving modes are conducted to demonstrate the performance and reliability of the rule-based control strategy. Average NOx reduction rates of 78. 5 % and 60 % are achieved for the ESC and <b>ETC</b> <b>tests</b> respectively. In the mean time, the average urea dosage is 160 gram for the ESC tests and 0. 49 % of the fuel consumption for the <b>ETC</b> <b>tests.</b> Variation of less than 7. 78 % and 12. 05 % for the ESC and <b>ETC</b> <b>tests</b> respectively demonstrate the reliability of the rule-based control strategy...|$|R
