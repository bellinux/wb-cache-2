5|$|Each {{contestant}} had {{the same}} decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt {{to answer the question}} or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their question {{at the end of the}} tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.|$|E
5|$|Yuan Hsieh (d. +1220) was Director-General of {{governmental}} grain stores. In pursuance of his schemes for {{the relief of}} famines he issued orders that each pao (village) should prepare a map which would show the fields and mountains, the rivers and the roads in fullest detail. The maps of all the pao were joined {{together to make a}} map of the tu (larger district), and these in turn were joined with others to make a map of the hsiang and the hsien (still larger districts). If there was any trouble about the collection of taxes or the distribution of grain, or <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of chasing robbers and bandits arose, the provincial officials could readily carry out their duties by the aid of the maps.|$|E
25|$|The {{interrogative}} form can {{be formed}} by two methods: The intonation and the Suffix -š.

25|$|Originalism {{allows the}} dead hand of prior generations to control {{important}} contemporary issues to an extraordinary and unnecessary level of detail. While {{everyone agrees that}} broad constitutional principles should control, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is whether abortion is a fundamental right, why should past centuries-old intentions be controlling? The originalist's distinction between original meaning and original intention here is unclear due {{to the difficulty of}} discussing meaning in terms of specific details that the Constitutional text does not clarify.|$|E
25|$|Before {{reaching}} the constitutional questions, the Supreme Court first considered {{whether it had}} jurisdiction or not. According to precedent, when hearing an appeal on certiorari from the highest court of a state, the United States Supreme Court will only pass judgment on the constitutionality of a state law <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> was first raised in state court. Relying on New York ex rel. Bryant v. Zimmerman, 278 U.S. 63, 67 (1928), cf. People v. McLucas, 15 N.Y.2d 167, 172, 204 N.E.2d 846, 848 (1965), the Supreme Court held that it did in fact have jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|In the Listening exam of 2007, {{there was}} a part asking {{students}} to determine whether marked sentences were correct or not, based on the whole recording. There were 10 questions, carrying 2 marks each. In that part, if a candidate answered a question correctly, 2 marks were awarded but <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> was answered, 2 marks were deducted. No marks were given or deducted for blank answers. A candidate who answered all the questions, {{with no more than}} 5 being correct, would end up having no marks for that section, but if 5 were correct, 10 marks were given. That stirred up controversy among candidates, who claimed that the marking scheme was not fair. They said that all questions were compulsory so there should not be any advantage to those who left some of the blanks empty by deducting marks for wrong answers. The HKEAA said that it had been in practice for years to prevent students guessing answers, but in fact, this type of marking had appeared only in table-type questions in which candidates were required to tick some of the boxes in the table but not in questions in which all blanks were to be filled.|$|E
30|$|The low {{usefulness}} {{of these questions}} might {{be attributed to the}} fact that these questions are very general and have little relation to <b>the</b> <b>question</b> in <b>the</b> discussion topic 1 (“Should we stop producing nuclear energy and develop renewable energy instead”). <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> were more specific, for example, “What does the catastrophe at the Fukushima power plant in Japan remind you of?”, this could be more useful.|$|R

500|$|Thurston {{began an}} inquest on September 23, and on September 28 he {{concluded}} that Hendrix had aspirated his own vomit and died of asphyxia while intoxicated with barbiturates. Citing [...] "insufficient evidence of [...] circumstances", he recorded an open verdict. He commented: [...] "The {{cause of death was}} clearly inhalation of vomit due to barbiturate intoxication, but there is no evidence as to intention to commit suicide... <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of intention cannot be answered, then it is proper to find the cause of death and leave it an open verdict." [...] Dannemann later stated that Hendrix had taken nine of her prescribed Vesparax sleeping tablets. Intended to be taken in half-tablet doses, nine tablets of the powerful sedative amounted to 18 times the recommended amount.|$|E

500|$|Two contestants {{compete on}} each episode. On each turn, a Bingo ball {{comes out of}} the hopper and a {{question}} is asked. Each ball has a number from 1 to 75 and a letter in the word [...] "BINGO" [...] printed on it. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is answered correctly, the player earns the letter from that ball and the number on the ball is added in dollars to the bank, which starts at $500 (e.g., if G-50 comes out, the bank increases by $50). If the letter is a duplicate already earned by the player, no extra letters are earned. The first player that spells out BINGO from the earned letters wins the game. A Free-Space Ball with a sponsor's logo acts as a wild card in the game. The player who answers a question correctly when that ball is rolled out can choose any letter, and $100 is added to the bank. Two regular games are played. Contestants who win both games win the match and receive {{all the money in the}} bank. If each contestant wins one game, a five-question tie-breaker game is played. The first question's answer begins with a B, the second question's answer starts with I, and so on. The first to answer three questions correctly wins the money in the bank and goes on to play the Bingo Bonus Board for a chance at $100,000.|$|E

50|$|The Leader of the Opposition usually asks six {{questions}} at PMQs, {{either as a}} whole block or in two separate groups of three. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> first <b>question</b> is asked by a government backbencher, the Leader of the Opposition is the second MP to ask <b>questions.</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> first <b>question</b> is asked by an opposition MP, this {{will be followed by}} a question from a government MP and then by <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> from <b>the</b> Leader of the Opposition.

50|$|The {{identity}} of the murderer is not automatically revealed {{at the end of}} the game.

[...] For instance, the rebbetzin may often be the [...] "mikvah lady" [...] and help with more mundane questions regarding the laws of niddah.

2500|$|Rather than {{attempt to}} define {{intentions}} in abstraction from actions, thus taking the third heading first, Anscombe {{begins with the}} concept of an intentional action. This soon connected with the second heading. She says that what is up with a human being is an intentional action <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> [...] "Why", taken in a certain sense (and evidently conceived as addressed to him), has application. An agent can answer the [...] "why" [...] question by giving a reason or purpose for her action. [...] "To do Y" [...] or [...] "because I want to do Y" [...] would be typical answers to this sort of [...] "why?"; though they are not the only ones, they are crucial to the constitution of the phenomenon as a typical phenomenon of human life. The agent's answer helps supply the descriptions under which the action is intentional. Anscombe was the first to clearly spell out that actions are intentional under some descriptions and not others. In her famous example, a man's action (which we might observe as consisting in moving an arm up and down while holding a handle) may be intentional under the description [...] "pumping water" [...] but not under other descriptions such as [...] "contracting these muscles", [...] "tapping out this rhythm", and so on.
