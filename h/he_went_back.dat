5|$|In 1994, Wilder {{starred in}} the NBC sitcom Something Wilder.

5|$|In that year, he {{took the}} civil service exam, likely in Chang'an. He failed, to his {{surprise}} and that of centuries of later critics. Hung concludes that he probably failed because his prose style {{at the time was}} too dense and obscure, while Chou suggests his failure to cultivate connections in the capital may have been to blame. After this failure, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to traveling, this time around Shandong and Hebei.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the special}} edition's footage was first seen when the film made its {{broadcast}} television debut on CBS in 1989, but two additional sequences concerning Burke's transmission to the colony about the derelict, and the Jorden family's subsequent discovery of the same, {{were added to the}} initial Laserdisc release. According to Cameron, the visual effects for the scene were incomplete, so <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to the Skotak brothers and had them finish the sequences.

5|$|In Italy, Archduke John went {{up against}} Napoleon's stepson Eugène. The Austrians beat back several bungled French assaults at the Battle of Sacile in April, causing Eugène {{to fall back}} on Verona and the Adige River, but Eugène regrouped and {{launched}} a more mature offensive that expelled the Austrians from Northern Italy again. By the time of Wagram, Eugène's forces had joined Napoleon's main army. In Dalmatia, Marmont, under the nominal command of Eugène, was fighting against General Stoichewich. Marmont launched a mountain offensive on 30 April, but this was repulsed by the Grenzer troops. Like Eugène, however, Marmont did not let an initial setback dictate the tempo of the conflict. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> on the offensive and joined Napoleon at Wagram.|$|E

They were married in the Bolton Street Register Office, and Julia wrote 'cinema usherette' on the {{marriage}} certificate as her occupation, {{even though she had}} never been one. None of Julia's family were there, but Alf's brother Sydney acted as a witness. They spent their honeymoon eating at 'Reece's' restaurant in Clayton Square (which is where his son would later celebrate after his marriage to Cynthia Powell), and then went to a cinema.

5|$|In 1823 Hogg met Jane Williams {{while they}} were both visiting Percy Shelley's friend John Gisborne, husband of Maria Gisborne. Jane and her common-law husband Edward Ellerker Williams had been housemates of Shelley's shortly before his death. Edward Williams and Shelley died in a boating accident, leaving Jane alone with two young children. Hogg soon became very enamoured with her. They saw {{each other at the}} Gisborne {{household}} regularly during the autumn and early winter of 1823. That December <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to Northern England to see his family. While he was there, he began writing to Jane regularly. The following spring he frequently visited her at her mother's house, and they often took long walks together. In March she moved out of her mother's house into a home of her own, allowing Hogg to see her more freely.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{made the}} Pro Bowl again in 1952, {{when he had}} 952 total yards and six touchdowns. Cleveland {{advanced}} to the NFL championship {{for the third time}} in a row that year, losing 17–7 to the Detroit Lions. In 1953, Jones's production declined: he had just 401 total yards and no touchdowns, and he decided to retire after the Browns reached and lost another championship game. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to Ruston to work at a lumber business he ran in the offseason, but Brown asked him to return in 1954, saying the team needed him. Jones played for two more years, winning two more championships with the Browns before retiring for good. He pulled his hamstring in an exhibition game before the 1955 season, an injury that caused him to miss several games and bothered him all season.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Victor (Len) Waters (20June 1924– 24August 1993) was {{the first}} Aboriginal Australian {{military}} aviator, {{and the only one}} to serve as a fighter pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World WarII. Aborigines at the time suffered significant discrimination and disadvantages in Australian society, such as restrictions on movement, residence, employment, and access to services and citizenship. Born in northern New South Wales and raised in Queensland, Waters was working as a shearer when he joined the RAAF in 1942. Training initially as a mechanic, he volunteered for flying duties and graduated as a sergeant pilot in 1944. He flew P-40 Kittyhawks in the South West Pacific theatre, where he completed 95 missions, mainly close air support. By {{the end of the war}} he had risen to the rank of warrant officer. Following his discharge from the RAAF in 1946, he attempted to start a regional airline but was unable to secure financial backing and government approval. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to shearing, and died in 1993 at the age of 69.|$|E

5|$|Motley {{grew up in}} Canton, Ohio. He played {{football}} through {{high school and college}} in the 1930s before enlisting in the military during World War II. While training in the U.S. Navy in 1944, he played for a service team coached by Paul Brown. Following the war, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to work in Canton before Brown invited him to try out for the Cleveland Browns, a team he was coaching in the newly formed AAFC. Motley made the team in 1946 and became a cornerstone of Cleveland's success in the late 1940s. The team won four AAFC championships before the league dissolved and the Browns were absorbed by the more established NFL. Motley was the AAFC's leading rusher in 1948 and the NFL leader in 1950, when the Browns won another championship.|$|E
5|$|Muhanna later {{reestablished}} {{contact with}} the Ilkhanate, causing the sultan to banish him with his whole tribe in 1320. On an-Nasir's order, the Mamluk army in Syria drove the Al Fadl from their home district of Salamiyah and pursued them eastward up to the Euphrates fortress towns of al-Rahba and Anah. According to Ibn Abi al-Fada'il, Muhanna was punished because <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> on an agreement his son Sulayman made with an-Nasir in 1319. The agreement stipulated that the Al Fadl would receive 250,000 silver dirhams and the iqtaʿat of Adhri'at and Bosra in return for joining the Mamluk army as auxiliaries in an upcoming campaign against Ilkhanid-held Sinjar; an-Nasir gave them the iqtaʿat and money, but when the Mamluk army arrived, Muhanna's forces stopped it at 'Urd near Palmyra and refused it passage through Al Fadl territory. The tribe was exiled from their encampments in the Palmyrene steppe and were forced to live deep in the Syrian Desert.|$|E
5|$|Graves, {{who fell}} to second in class, went into Rivage's gravel trap with a left-front brake failure, {{causing him to}} retire. Toyota retired their No. 6 entry from the race because of an engine failure caused by an {{electrical}} fault. Smoke bellowed from the rear-end of Nakajima's Toyota upon leaving La Source and <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> into the pit lane where his mechanics worked on rectifying the problem allowing Oliver Jarvis in the No. 8 Audi to inherit the lead. Webber drove straight at the Bus Stop chicane, spun, and drove into the pit lane. Stefan Mücke, who was affected by turbocharger issues, {{lost control of the}} No. 66 Ford after one of his rear tyres was punctured, and narrowly avoided going airborne. The vehicle made heavy contact with the left-hand side barriers at Raidillon, heavily damaging the front-end and removing both of its doors, as well as littering debris onto the circuit. His car stopped in the centre of the track, causing the No. 2 Porsche to swerve to avoid hitting the vehicle, and the safety car was deployed to allow marshals to repair the heavily damaged tyre barrier. Drivers were instructed to steer onto the right-hand side of the track at Eau Rouge because the stranded car blocked the turn. Mücke was transported to the track's medical centre and later taken to the local hospital for a precautionary check-up because of bruising.|$|E

5|$|In {{return for}} ending the war, Macedon {{was made a}} member of the Amphictyonic council, and given the two votes which had been {{stripped}} from Phocis. This was an important moment for Philip, since membership of the Ampictyony meant that Macedon was now no longer a 'barbarian' state in Greek eyes. The terms imposed on Phocis were harsh, but realistically Philip {{had no choice but to}} impose such sanctions; he needed the support of the Thessalians (sworn enemies of Phocis), and could not risk losing the prestige that he had won for his pious conduct during the war. Aside from being expelled from the Amphictyonic council, all the Phocian cities were to be destroyed, and the Phocians settled in 'villages' of no more than fifty houses; the money stolen from the temple was to be paid back at a rate of 60 talents per year; the Phocians were not, however, destroyed, and they retained their land. The Athenians, having made peace with Philip, were not penalised by the Amphictyonic council, and the Spartans also seem to have escaped lightly. Philip presided over the Amphictyonic festival in the autumn, and then much to the surprise of the Greeks, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to Macedon and did not return to Greece for seven years. He did however retain his access, by garrisoning the closest town to Thermopylae, Nicaea with Thessalian troops.|$|E
5|$|In the 1961–62 NBA season, {{the aging}} Cousy {{slowly began to}} fade statistically, {{averaging}} 15.7 points, 3.5 rebounds and 7.8 assists, and was voted into the All-NBA Second Team after ten consecutive First Team nominations. Still, he enjoyed a satisfying postseason, winning the 1962 NBA Finals after 4–3 battles against two upcoming teams, the Philadelphia Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers. The Finals series against the Lakers was especially dramatic, because Lakers guard Frank Selvy failed to make a last-second buzzer beater in Game 7 which would have won the title. Finally, in the 1962–63 NBA season, {{the last of his}} career, Cousy averaged 13.2 points, 2.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists, and collected one last All-Star and All-NBA Second Team nomination. In the 1963 NBA Finals, the Celtics again won 4–2 against the Lakers, and Cousy finished his career on a high note: {{in the fourth quarter of}} Game 6, Cousy sprained an ankle and had to be helped to the bench. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> in with Boston up 1. Although he did not score again, his was credited with providing an emotional lift that carried the Celtics to victory, 112–109. The game ended with Cousy throwing the ball into the rafters.|$|E
5|$|At 09:00 on 21 October, US 3/187 RCT {{began to}} advance south {{to clear the}} Sukchon to Yongju road towards Pyongyang. The American paratroopers {{advanced}} on two fronts, with I Company moving along the railway line and K Company along the highway. At 13:00 I Company reached Opa-ri, where it encountered a strong North Korean force estimated as a battalion, equipped with 120mm mortars and 40mm guns. I Company was caught in an ambush. The North Koreans subsequently attacked the paratroopers and after a battle lasting two-and-a-half hours, they overran two American platoons. I Company was forced to withdraw west of the railway to Hill 281 having suffered 90 men missing. Despite their success, the North Koreans subsequently withdrew to their own defensive positions in the high ground around Opa-ri. Amid the fighting, an American medic attached to I Company, Private First Class Richard G. Wilson, was killed while attempting to reach a wounded {{man who had been}} left behind, and he was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. Wilson had repeatedly exposed himself to North Korean fire to render aid to the wounded, and later helped many to safety following the order to withdraw. On hearing that one of the Americans previously thought to be dead had been seen attempting to crawl to safety, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to the battlefield to search for him and had disappeared. Two days later a patrol found Wilson lying dead beside the man he had returned to rescue, having been shot while trying to shield him from further injury.|$|E
