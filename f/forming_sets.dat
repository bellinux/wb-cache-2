5000|$|To find non-contradictory {{reflection}} principles {{we might}} argue informally as follows. Suppose {{that we have}} some collection A of methods for <b>forming</b> <b>sets</b> (for example, taking powersets, subsets, the axiom of replacement, and so on). We can imagine taking all sets obtained by repeatedly applying all these methods, and form these sets into a class V, which {{can be thought of}} as a model of some set theory. But now we can introduce the following new principle for forming sets: [...] "the collection of all sets obtained from some set by repeatedly applying all methods in the collection A is also a set". If we allow this new principle for <b>forming</b> <b>sets,</b> we can now continue past V, and consider the class W of all sets formed using the principles A and the new principle. In this class W, V is just a set, closed underall the set-forming operations of A. In other words the universe W contains a set V which resembles W in that it is closed under all the methods A.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} the regular linear Sturm-Liouville problem (second-order linear ordinary differential equation with boundary conditions at two points x = 0 and x = 1, those conditions being separated and homogeneous) with several real parameters λ 1,…,λN. Solutions {{to this problem}} correspond to eigenvaluesλ = (λ 1,…,λN) <b>forming</b> <b>sets</b> RN determined {{by the number of}} zeroes in (0, 1) of solutions. We describe properties of these sets including: boundedness, and when unbounded, asymptotic directions. Using these properties some results are given for the system of N Sturm-Liouville problems which share only the parameters λ. Sharp results are given for the system of two problems sharing two parameters. The eigensurfaces for a single problem are closely related to the cone K={λ RN:λ 1 a 1 (x) +…+λNaN (x) ↬ 0 for all x in [0, 1]}, particularly in questions of boundedness. The cone K and related objects are discussed, and a result is given which relates cones with two oscillation conditions known as “Right-Definiteness” and “Left-Definiteness. ...|$|E
40|$|Robotic {{failure is}} all too common in {{unstructured}} robot tasks. Despite well designed controllers, robots often fail due to unexpected events. How do robots measure unexpected events? Many do not. Most robots are driven by the senseplan- act paradigm, however more recently robots are working with a sense-plan-act-verify paradigm. In this work we present a principled methodology to bootstrap robot introspection for contact tasks. In effect, {{we are trying to}} answer the question, what did the robot do? To this end, we hypothesize that all noisy wrench data inherently contains patterns that can be effectively represented by a vocabulary. The vocabulary is generated by meaningfully segmenting the data and then encoding it. When the wrench information represents a sequence of sub-tasks, we can think of the vocabulary <b>forming</b> <b>sets</b> of words or sentences, such that each subtask is uniquely represented by a word set. Such sets can be classified using statistical or machine learning techniques. We use SVMs and Mondrian Forests to classify contacts tasks both in simulation and in real robots for one and dual arm scenarios showing the general robustness of the approach. The contribution of our work is the presentation of a simple but generalizable semantic scheme that enables a robot to understand its high level state. This verification mechanism can provide feedback for high-level planners or reasoning systems that use semantic descriptors as well.

40|$|The {{article is}} based on the study {{conducted}} in years 1979 - 85 on the group of 207 young adult offenders tried in Poznań District Court. The purpose of the study Was to perform a synthesizing evaluation of efficiency of particular penal measures [...] The basis of the evaluation is an attempt to grasp the connections and dependencies between typical crime generating factors (exo- and endogenic) — grouped in 11 structures and <b>forming</b> <b>sets</b> characterized by different degrees of cumulation — and the offenders' subsequent lines of conduct, determined by the levels of their recidivism, and to determine the influence of measures applied by the courts on the above dependencies. No connnection was found between the degree of cumulation of crime generating factors and severity of the measure. The penalty of deprivation of liberty was in cases of greater cumulation of crime generating factors even less frequent than in variants with weak cumulation of these factors. It indicates that Art. 51 of Criminal Code is not always applied. (i. e. the exposition of educational aims of proceedings concerning the young adult offenders). The highest percentage of recidivism occurs after the penalty of deprivation of liberty (39, 3 %), somewhat lower after the conditional suspension of the execution of such penalty (32, 6 %), small after the penalty of restricted liberty (6, 4 %); there is no recidivism after autonomous fine and after educational and corrective measures. The relation between the recidivism and the lack of stabilization (i. e. the situation when the offender does not relapse into crime but nevertheless does not stabilize his situation through e. g. taking a job) is statistically significant (p< 0, 001) with correlation coefficient v = 0, 411. The above result indicates the lack of efficiency of applied penal measures and suggests the need of changes in the policy of punishing.

40|$|The 2 ̆ 2 Next Generation Sequencing 2 ̆ 2 (NGS) {{scientific}} revolution {{continues to}} enable deeper exploration of genome biology. While NGS technologies {{are capable of}} sequencing both DNA and RNA, its utility for exploring changes in gene transcription, via RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), is two-fold. Namely, differential gene expression between treatments/conditions, and alternative RNA transcripts (or, isoforms) based on exons. Each of these phenomenon can be of biological relevance if related to treatment or condition. Historically, sets of genomic features and exon features have been accessed independently to identify responses of interest. The motivation for this work is to knit together these concepts {{for the purpose of}} <b>forming</b> <b>sets</b> of related hypotheses that encompass a broader range of gene response to treatment than either, individually. Included as part of the methodological evolution of how hypotheses are tested and biological phenomena described are two fundamentally associated and seemingly unrelated issues; namely an investigation of the interplay between sample size, read depth and statistical power in RNA-sequencing experimental design, and an improved approach with software for simulating genomic read counts from transcript data. ^ A multi-level inference is presented for the purpose of incorporating exon usage into null hypotheses for testing differential expression. This procedure is novel, inventive, and statistically powerful compared to current standard genome methodology, such as a gene exact test, and unlike transcriptome based methods, does not require discovery of complete transcripts; it only requires that exon counting bins be described in order to incorporate differential usage of exons into experimental response. ^ This work also introduces Sub-Exon Principal Components Analysis MANOVA (SEPCAM), a novel method for describing exon expression via principal components (PC) for purpose of determining statistically significant response to treatment in experiments. SEPCAM summarizes the biology of exon usage in the transcriptome, uses that biology to justify principal components analysis on genome exon data, and then builds projected sub-exon data into statistical evidence of response to treatment. In the broader biological picture, this work demonstrates that most sub-exon expression is along the first PC, and the second PC assists in incorporating complex biological changes of transcript RNA expression into gene response. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{business}} continuity management involves {{the process of}} identification and elimination of interrupt information systems and other business processes within various institutions, enterprises and organizations. One of the important directions of this concept {{is to protect the}} information and communication systems and networks from negative influences caused by information security incidents. According to international standards any incident can be interruption. Depending on the complexity or criticality is determined according to the principle feasibility and adequate set of measures. The most critical incidents called crisis, but today there is no conventional signs and their criteria. Some incidents in the absence of monitoring can acquire features characteristic crisis. That is, {{it can be argued that}} there are cause-effect relationships between crisis management and information security incidents with a high degree of criticality, defined level of losses, the number of victims and other characteristics that incident, a potential crisis situation. Therefore, the development of an integrated model representation crisis that has become the basis for the creation of methods and means of detection and evaluation is relevant and important scientific problems. In this study integrated model representation crisis situations through the use of fuzzy logic can be used to describe any category of crisis in terms of weakly-formalized fuzzy environment was proposed. According to the model crisis presented by six component tuple: identifier of potential incident-crisis situation; subset of identifying parameters; subset of standards describing values identifying parameters; subset of fuzzy current values identifying parameters; subset of heuristic rules and the level of criticality of the situation. Each component is described in detail in the defined set of parameters and identifiers identifying potential crisis situations. Crisis representation model through synthesis and evaluation identifying parameters combined with elements of fuzzy logic and expert approach allows you to build more flexible and effective methods for the detection and evaluation of crisis, given the possibility of <b>forming</b> <b>sets</b> of sets necessary parameters and use in weakly-formalized environment. In addition, the paper based on the method of linguistic terms based on statistics was offered a formalized procedure for forming standards identifying parameters. Standards necessary for the formation of logical rules that allow the system identification and evaluation of crisis were formed. ????????? ?????????? ?????????????? ??????? ??????????????? ???????? ????????? ? ?????????? ?????????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ?????? ? ?????? ??????-????????? ? ?????? ????????? ??????????, ??????????? ? ???????????. ????? ?? ?????? ??????????? ?????????? ???? ????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????????-???????????????? ?????? ? ????? ?? ?????????? ???????????, ????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ????????????. ?? ????????????? ?????????? ??????????? ????? ???? ????? ????????. ? ??????????? ?? ??? ????????? ??? ??????????? ???????? ???????? ???????????????? ???????????? ?????????? ????? ??????? ? ??? ????????????. ???????? ??????????? ????????? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ??????????, ?????? ?? ??????????? ???? ?? ?????????? ?? ???????????? ????????? ? ?????????. ???????????, ??? ????????? ????????? ??? ?????????? ???????? ????? ??????????? ????????, ??????????? ????????? ?????????. ?? ???? ????? ??????????, ??? ?????????? ????????-???????????? ????? ????? ????????? ????????? ? ?????????? ?????????????? ???????????? ? ??????? ???????? ???????????, ??????? ???????????? ????????? ??????, ?????? ???????????? ? ??????? ????????????????, ?? ???? ??????????-????????????? ????????? ?????????. ??????? ?????????? ??????????????? ?????? ????????????? ????????? ????????, ??????? ?????? ????? ??????? ??? ???????? ??????? ? ??????? ?? ??????????? ? ??????, ???????? ?????????? ? ?????? ??????? ???????. ? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ?????? ????????????? ????????? ????????, ??????? ?? ???? ????????????? ???????? ?????? ????? ???? ????????? ??? ???????? ????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ? ???????? ????????????????????? ???????? ?????. ???????? ?????? ????????? ???????? ???????????? ????????????????? ????????, ???????????? ???????? ????????: ????????????? ?????????-????????????? ????????? ????????; ???????????? ???????????????? ??????????; ???????????? ????????, ??????????? ???????? ???????????????? ??????????; ???????????? ??????? ???????? ???????? ???????????????? ??????????; ???????????? ????????????? ?????? ? ??????? ??????????? ????????. ?????? ????????? ???????? ??????????????? ? ??????, ?????????? ????????? ???????????????? ?????????? ? ??????????????? ????????????? ????????? ????????. ?????? ????????????? ????????? ???????? ?? ???? ????????? ????????? ? ???????????????? ?????????? ? ????????? ? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ????? ?????? ? ??????????? ?????? ????????? ? ?????? ????????? ????????, ??????????? ??????????? ???????????? ??????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????? ? ????????????? ? ???????? ????????????????????? ?????. ????? ????, ? ?????? ?? ???? ?????? ??????????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ?????????????? ?????? ?????????? ??????????????? ????????? ???????????? ???????? ???????????????? ??????????. ?????????????? ??????? ?????????? ??? ???????????? ?????????? ??????, ??????????? ?????????? ???????????????? ??????? ????????? ? ?????? ????????? ????????...|$|E
