40|$|The Clean Coal Technology Demonstration Program (CCT Program) is a $ 7. 14 billion cost-shared industry/government {{technology}} development effort. The {{program is to}} demonstrate {{a new generation of}} advanced coal-based technologies, with the most promising technologies being moved into the domestic and international marketplace. Clean coal technologies being demonstrated under the CCT program are creating the technology base that allows the nation to meet its energy and environmental goals efficiently and reliably. The fact that most of the demonstrations are being conducted at commercial scale, in actual user environments, and under conditions typical of commercial operations allows the potential of the technologies to be evaluated in their intended commercial applications. The technologies are categorized into four market sectors: advanced electric power generation systems; environmental control devices; coal processing equipment for clean fuels; and industrial technologies. Sections of this report describe the following: Role of the Program; Program implementation; Funding and costs; The road to commercial realization; Results from completed projects; Results and accomplishments from ongoing projects; and Project fact sheets. Projects include fluidized-bed combustion, integrated gasification combined-cycle power plants, advanced combustion and heat engines, nitrogen oxide control technologies, sulfur dioxide control technologies, combined SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x} technologies, coal preparation techniques, mild gasification, and indirect liquefaction.

Analysis of the liquid solutions showed that the concentration of bicarbonate increases with pH at a pH larger than 5. 5 indicating a loss of effectiveness of the sodium reagent. A practical discharge pH of the liquid discharge from the scrubber is also greater than 4 as at a lower pH the absorption rate of SO₂ reduced.

40|$|Wet {{flue gas}} {{desulfurization}} (wet FGD) systems are currently installed on about 25 % of the coal-fired utility generating {{capacity in the}} U. S., representing about 15 % {{of the number of}} coal-fired units. Depending on the effect of operating parameters such as mercury content of the coal, form of mercury (elemental or oxidized) in the <b>flue</b> <b>gas,</b> <b>scrubber</b> spray tower configuration, liquid-to-gas ratio, and slurry chemistry, FGD systems can provide cost-effective, near-term mercury emissions control options with a proven history of commercial operation. For boilers already equipped with FGD systems, the incremental cost of any vapor phase mercury removal achieved is minimal. To be widely accepted and implemented, technical approaches that improve mercury removal performance for wet FGD systems should also have low incremental costs and have little or no impact on operation and SO{sub 2 } removal performance. The ultimate goal of the Full-scale Testing of Enhanced Mercury Control for Wet FGD Systems Program was to commercialize methods for the control of mercury in coal-fired electric utility systems equipped with wet flue gas desulfurization (wet FGD). The program was funded by the U. S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory, the Ohio Coal Development Office within the Ohio Department of Development, and Babcock & Wilcox. Host sites and associated support were provided by Michigan South Central Power Agency (MSCPA) and Cinergy. Field-testing was completed at two commercial coal-fired utilities with wet FGD systems: (1) MSCPA's 55 MW{sub e} Endicott Station and (2) Cinergy's 1300 MW{sub e} Zimmer Station. Testing was conducted at these two locations because of the large differences in size and wet scrubber chemistry. Endicott employs a limestone, forced oxidation (LSFO) wet FGD system, whereas Zimmer uses Thiosorbic{reg_sign} Lime (magnesium enhanced lime) and ex situ oxidation.

The application of new process sensors, improved furnace design, intelligent control strategy and waste gas heat recovery systems support the glass manufacturers to achieve ever increasing requirements concerning energy efficiency and emission limits. Glass industries are searching for breakthrough innovations (revolution), but introduction of such major changes in industry is hampered by large risks and investments.

40|$|Heavy metal {{emissions}} {{are a significant}} pollutant in both <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> and wastewater in power plants. Due to their wide range of health and environmental hazards, research into their behavior in <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> and reduction in wet scrubbers is of vital importance. In order to understand heavy metal reduction, knowledge has to be supported by speciation and phase behavior in <b>flue</b> <b>gas.</b> In the EU ever increasing emission limits are {{the driving force behind}} improvements in heavy metal emission control. The general aim of this thesis was to investigate heavy metal reduction behavior and efficiencies in wet <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>scrubbers.</b> This investigation was divided into three different target goals: modeling tool investigation, data survey, and measurement campaign. Modeling tool review was conducted through three approaches: commercial modeling tools, specific and detailed thermodynamic modeling tool, and finally lumped model –tool. The initial idea was to examine heavy metal behavior and sensitivity in <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> from the furnace outflow to the stack, but due to multiple issues this approach was simplified to only investigate some reduction phenomena. Data survey was performed on existing data, such as publications and previous measurement reports. The idea behind data survey was to find information and measurement data on heavy metal reduction that would support findings from the measurement campaign. Finally, the measurement campaign was conducted in order to examine reduction and heavy metal behavior in a proper, controlled environment and find patterns in behavior and reduction phenomena. Calculation tools failed to provide a comprehensive modeling tool to investigate heavy metal behavior in <b>flue</b> <b>gas,</b> but some advances were made in reduction prediction. Commercial modeling programs proved to be lacking in heavy metal species and scrubber type data. Thermodynamic and kinetic modeling was incompatible and too complex for the scope of this study, although some useful calculation methods were identified and refined. Lumped model –tool was created to predict heavy metal reduction with data received from data surveys and measurement campaign. Data surveys managed to find some data, which lead to determining average reduction efficiencies for most investigated heavy metals and the data was also used to evaluate heavy metal speciation and phase in <b>flue</b> <b>gas.</b> Data surveys suffered from typical issues, such as measurement inaccuracies, data availability, and comparability. Finally, the measurement campaign was conducted on two combined heat and power plants and five individual cases were measured. Measurement campaign data used failed to provide accurate mass balance evaluations, process parameter sensitivity or cut-off concentrations, but some reduction rates were calculated and heavy metal class behavior identified...|$|R

40|$|Wet {{lime and}} {{limestone}} <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> desulfurization (FGD) <b>scrubbers</b> are in widespread use worldwide to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired electric power generating facilities. The environments {{found in many}} parts of these systems are very corrosive, containing mixed (generally reducing) acids, oxidizing salts, and significant levels of halides at elevated temperatures. To resist these aggressive conditions, highly alloyed, nickel-base materials are widely used.

Recent field experience and laboratory tests have demonstrated that advanced corrosion-resistant alloys offer excellent resistance to even the most corrosive FGD environments. In the past, autogeneous and matching weld metals have sometimes exhibited preferential corrosion due to elemental segregation in the cast weld structure. However, by the use of over-matching composition welding products, weld metals can be deposited which exhibit corrosion resistance equivalent to or better than wrought alloy products.

This new membrane wet electrostatic precipitator (WESP) system is ideally suited to, and very cost effective for, removing PM 2. 5, SO 3 and Hg+ 2 after limestone wet <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> desulphurization (WFGD) <b>scrubbers</b> in the utility industry. Several coal-fired utilities have been experiencing increased SO 3 emissions from their existing WFGD scrubbers, especially after installing a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for NOx Control. Achieving co-benefits of Hg removal by installing SCR's and WFGD systems is already becoming a key strategy for reducing mercury levels after coal fired power plants. WESP can readily collect acid aerosol and fine particulate due to greater corona power and virtually no re-entrainment. The WESP can also enhance collection of Hg (Hg ash & Hg+ 2). The main historical limitation associated with wet precipitators has been the higher cost of special alloys and stainless steel material used in their manufacture. This new technology WESP, based on fabric membrane for the collecting electrodes, dramatically reduces weight and cost, compared to conventional, metallic WESPs...|$|R
40|$|Coal-fired {{power plants}} {{are a major}} source of mercury (Hg) {{released}} into the environment and the utility industry is currently investigating options to reduce Hg emissions. One control option is to utilize existing pollution control equipment such as wet <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> desulfurization (FGD) <b>scrubbers.</b> The split (speciation) between chemical forms of mercury (Hg) species has a strong influence on the control and environmental fate of Hg emissions from coal combustion. The high-temperature coal combustion process releases Hg in elemental form (Hg 0). A significant fraction of the Hg 0 can be subsequently oxidized in the low-temperature, post-combustion environment of a coal-fired boiler. Relative to Hg 0, oxidized Hg (Hg 2 +) is more effectively removed by air pollution control systems (APCS). For example, the water-soluble Hg 2 + is much more easily captured than insoluble Hg 0 in FGD units. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology widely applied for reducing NOX emissions from power plants also affects the speciation of Hg in the coal combustion <b>flue</b> <b>gases.</b> Recent full-scale field tests conducted in the U. S. showed increases in Hg oxidation across the SCR catalysts for plants firing bituminous coals with sulfur (S) content ranging from 1. 0 to 3. 9 %.

40|$|The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAAs) {{require the}} U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to {{determine}} whether the presence of mercury and 188 other trace substances, referred to as air toxics or hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), in the stack emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric utility power plants poses an unacceptable public health risk (1). The EPA's conclusions and recommendations were presented in two reports: Mercury Study Report to Congress and Study of Hazardous Air Pollutant Emissions from Electric Utility Steam Generating Units-Final Report to Congress. The first congressional report addressed both human health and the environmental effects of anthropogenic mercury emissions, while the second report addressed the risk to public health posed by emissions of HAPs from steam electricity-generating units. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is also required by the CAAAs to investigate mercury and determine a safe threshold level of exposure. Recently the National Academy of Sciences has also been commissioned by Congress to complete a report, based the available scientific evidence, regarding safe threshold levels of mercury exposure. Although the EPA reports did not state that mercury controls on coal-fired electric power stations should be required given {{the current state of the}} art, they did indicate that EPA views mercury as a potential threat to human health. It is likely that major sources of mercury emissions, including fossil-fired combustion systems, will be controlled at some point. In fact, municipal waste combustion units are already regulated. In anticipation of additional control measures, much research has been done (and continues) regarding the development of control technologies for mercury emitted from stationary sources to the atmosphere. Most approaches taken to date involve sorbent injection technologies or improve upon removal of mercury using existing technologies such as <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> desulfurization <b>scrubbers,</b> fabric filters, and electrostatic precipitators. Depending on the fly ash chemistry and the form of mercury present in the <b>flue</b> <b>gas,</b> some of these existing technologies can be effective at capturing vapor-phase mercury from the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> stream. Although much research has been done on enhancing the removal of mercury from <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> streams, little research has focused on what happens to the mercury when it is captured and converted and/or transferred to a solid or aqueous solution. The stability (or mobility) of mercury in this final process is critical and leads to the questions, What impact will the increased concentration of mercury have on utilization, disposal, and reuse? and Is the mercury removed from the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> really removed from the environment or rereleased at a later point?

Currently more than 70 percent of the CCRs are land-disposed, and the other 30 percent are reused or recycled for commercial uses such as production of wallboard, cement, and asphalt. Use of mercury emission control technologies on coal-fired electric utility boilers will probably {{increase the amount of}} mercury in certain types of CCRs and also could change the composition and physical properties of these materials, possibly impacting their suitability for commercial reuse and recycling applications. Many of the potential retrofit mercury control technologies for coal-fired electric utility power plants remove mercury from the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> and concentrate the captured mercury into CCRs (i. e., fly ash collected by particulate matter (pm) control devices or solids/sludges generated by wet FGD scrubbers).

A life-cycle evaluation is being conducted by National Risk Management Risk Laboratory (NRMRL) to help evaluate any potential environmental trade-offs and to ensure that there is not an increased environmental risk for the management of CCRs resulting from mercury control technologies. In support of this evaluation, NRMRL is gathering data and information to assess future increases in mercury concentrations in CCRs resulting from applications of mercury emissions control requirements to coal fired electric utility boilers.

40|$|A {{process is}} under {{consideration}} that achieves treatment and regeneration of spent scrubber {{water from a}} NOx wet scrubbing process using a mixed-culture bioreactor. Preliminary prototype bioreactor operation suggests that, {{in addition to other}} desired reactions, a small concentration of dissolved sulfide (less than 5 mg/l) can be generated and maintained in the reactive process water. Presence of dissolved sulfide will allow precipitation of oxidized mercury that has passed from the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> into the <b>scrubber</b> solution. In addition, iron monosulfide precipitate in the reactive process stream will contribute to dissolved mercury removal as a result of rapid displacement of ferrous iron to form the more stable mercury sulfide. Metal sulfide would then be separated from bulk solution in a relatively small and concentrated stream using available solid/liquid separation technology. Concerns remain with regard to potential for methylation of mercury in the anoxic/anaerobic bioreactor. It is hypothesized that this can be avoided by prompt removal and pasteurization of metal sulfide precipitate. Further investigation of this phenomenon will be required.

A series of N-S compound batch crystallization studies were completed {{in a wide range of}} pH (7. 0 [...] 9. 0), and the influence of pH on the amount of lime required, as well as the amount of precipitate obtained, was investigated. Although the amount of precipitate increased with increase in solution pH, the safe or optimum pH for the precipitation of CaADS lies in the vicinity of 8. 2 to 8. 3. For studying the crystallization characteristics of CaADS crystals, a bench scale 7. 0 liter DDO crystallizer was built. DDO crystallizer is found to be superior compared to Mixed Suspension Mixed Product Removal (MSMPR) crystallizer. The precipitated crystals were analyzed for elemental composition by chemical analysis. The crystals were also examined under optical microscope for their morphological features. The present studies confirmed our prediction that N-S compounds in the waste liquor can be precipitated by a reaction with lime slurry. The precipitated crystals were mostly calcium imido disulfonate...|$|R

It also allows control over the temperature of gases leaving the stack (to meet emissions regulations, for example).|$|R
