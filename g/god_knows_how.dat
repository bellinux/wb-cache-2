25|$|Many {{philosophers}} developed {{arguments for}} the existence of God, while attempting to comprehend the precise implications of God's attributes. Reconciling some of those attributes generated important philosophical problems and debates. For example, God's omniscience may seem to imply that <b>God</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> free agents will choose to act. If God does know this, their ostensible free will might be illusory, or foreknowledge does not imply predestination, and if God does not know it, God may not be omniscient.|$|E
25|$|If {{you could}} {{demonstrate}} that the BBC was grossly extravagant {{there might be a}} case for saying OK take it away. But in fact the BBC per minute in almost every category is as cheap as you can find anywhere in the world and produces the best quality. If you take the money away, which part of the BBC will you remove? The BBC has gone through swingeing staff cuts. It has been cut to the bone, if you divert licence fee money elsewhere, you cut quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will say your licence fee is up for grabs. We will take it. There {{is a lot of people}} who want to see the BBC weakened. They talk of this terrible tax of the licence fee. Yet it is the best bargain that is going. Four radio channels and <b>god</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> many TV channels. It is piffling.|$|E
500|$|Despite her isolation, Charlotte found life at Cranbourne Lodge {{surprisingly}} agreeable, {{and slowly}} became reconciled to her situation. [...] At {{the end of}} July 1814, the Prince Regent visited Charlotte in her isolation and informed her {{that her mother was}} about to leave England for an extended stay on the Continent. [...] This upset Charlotte, but she did not feel that anything she might say could change her mother's mind, and was further aggrieved by her mother's casualness in the leavetaking, [...] "for <b>God</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> long, or what events may occur before we meet again". [...] Charlotte would never see her mother again. [...] In late August, Charlotte was permitted to go to the seaside. [...] She had asked to go to fashionable Brighton, but the Prince Regent refused, sending her instead to Weymouth. [...] As the Princess's coach stopped along the way, large, friendly crowds gathered to see her; according to Holme, [...] "her affectionate welcome shows that already people thought of her as their future Queen". [...] On arrival in Weymouth, there were illuminations with a centrepiece [...] "Hail Princess Charlotte, Europe's Hope and Britain's Glory". [...] Charlotte spent time exploring nearby attractions, shopping for smuggled French silks, and from late September taking a course of heated seawater baths. [...] She was still infatuated with her Prussian, and hoped in vain that he would declare his interest in her to the Prince Regent. If he did not do so, she wrote to a friend, she would [...] "take the next best thing, which was a good tempered man with good sence ... that man is the P of S-C" [...] In mid-December, shortly before leaving Weymouth, she [...] "had a very sudden and great shock" [...] when she received news that her Prussian had formed another attachment. [...] In a long talk after Christmas dinner, father and daughter made up their differences.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the end of}} the War, Surendranath Banerjee, {{followed}} by Barin Ghose and Motilal Roy, successfully negotiated the withdrawal of warrants against the fugitives accused of the Indo-German plot. Atul was adamant in obtaining a promise on these points : (a) there would be no question of surrendering arms; (b) no questions would be raised on their past activities; (c) no parole would be demanded concerning their future conducts. Atul came out in 1921. But his Dada’s (Jatin Mukherjee’s) heroic death, [...] "had knocked out his revolutionary ardour and he gave up active politics." [...] Yet, in January 1924, when Gopinath Saha killed an Englishman, mistaking him to be Tegart, the much-hated Commissioner of Kolkata Police (reputed to have shot Jatin Mukherjee dead), Atul was made a state-prisoner, to be released in 1926. The same year he married Menokarani Rakshit of Majilpur, 24 Parganas and took to business, dissociating himself completely from politics. They had no issues. In an interview with Prithwindra Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin's grandson), on 27 October 1963 - shortly before his death -, Atul sighed: [...] "Dada was a magnet; we all, iron scraps, received our energy from him. When he was no more, we all became iron scraps. I still do not know whether my first allegiance went to Dada, or to the Motherland." [...] Asked about the source of Jatindranath's tremendous force, Atul replied: [...] "He was a very well trained wrestler and an all-round sportsman. But what characterised him was his soul force and his power of concentration. He could pin-point all his energy to a single part of his body, for instance his fist. A single blow from that fist was equivalent to an electric charge of <b>God</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> many volts!" ...|$|E
