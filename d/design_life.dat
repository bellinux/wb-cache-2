For example, the ISS, Mars Odyssey and the Mars Global Surveyor are equipped with nickel-hydrogen batteries.

5|$|The micro {{format is}} the most durable {{from the point of}} view of {{designed}} insertion lifetime. The standard and mini connectors have a design lifetime of 1,500 insertion-removal cycles, the improved Mini-B connectors increased this to 5,000. The micro connectors were designed with frequent charging of portable devices in mind, so have a <b>design</b> <b>life</b> of 10,000 cycles and also place the flexible contacts, which wear out sooner, on the easily replaced cable, while the more durable rigid contacts are located in the receptacles. Likewise, the springy component of the retention mechanism, parts that provide required gripping force, were also moved into plugs on the cable side.|$|E

5|$|Responding to {{requests}} from Japanese airlines for a high-capacity aircraft to serve domestic routes between major cities, Boeing developed the 747SR as a short-range {{version of the}} 747-100 with lower fuel capacity and greater payload capability. With increased economy class seating, up to 498 passengers could be carried in early versions and up to 550 in later models. The 747SR had an economic <b>design</b> <b>life</b> objective of 52,000 flights during 20 years of operation, compared to 24,600 flights in 20 years for the standard 747. The initial 747SR model, the -100SR, had a strengthened body structure and landing gear to accommodate the added stress accumulated from {{a greater number of}} takeoffs and landings. Extra structural support was built into the wings, fuselage, and the landing gear along with a 20 percent reduction in fuel capacity.|$|E

40|$|Generally, the Chinese <b>designed</b> <b>life</b> of the high- grade asphalt {{concrete}} pavement is required 15 years, however, the <b>designed</b> <b>life</b> {{of the road}} in surface is often lower than the <b>designed</b> <b>life,</b> and even premature failure. Especially in heavy traffic conditions, the early damage of some high grade-asphalt pavement in China is serious. According to some investigations, we founded the main reason of the long-life asphalt pavement {{is to determine the}} function of each structure layer. According to the stress of pavement structure layer, so as to select the structure layer materials. Based on the viewpoint of mechanics, asphalt pavement damage mode is divided into three categories, such as top-down crack, fatigue cracking and rutting. Therefore, this paper uses ANSYS finite element software as calculation tool, the combination of road vehicle load and the primary influence on asphalt pavement structure mechanics response characteristics were analyzed. In this paper, the method of analysis is control variable: that means under different vehicle axle load, only change surface layer modulus and observe the pavement structure mechanical response trends to compare the effect. By using the same method, the response of the pavement base course parameters to the pavement mechanical structure is analyzed...|$|R

25|$|The {{existing}} bridge had {{a planned}} <b>design</b> <b>life</b> of 120 years, {{but by the}} early years of the 21st century the planned theoretical capacity for the bridge was being routinely exceeded. It was designed for up to 11 million vehicles per year, but this had risen steadily to 23 million vehicles in 2006. Between 2003 and 2005, an inspection programme found that the main suspension cables had suffered an estimated 8–10% loss of strength as a result of corrosion. Projections highlighted the likelihood of an accelerating loss of strength, with traffic restrictions to limit loading required in 2014 in the worst-case scenario.|$|E

The Bakerloo line {{will be part of the}} New Tube for London Project.

25|$|Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs) are {{spare parts}} {{that can be}} readily {{replaced}} when a unit either passes its <b>design</b> <b>life</b> or fails. Examples of ORUs are pumps, storage tanks, controller boxes, antennas, and battery units. Some units can be replaced using robotic arms. Many are stored outside the station, either on small pallets called ExPRESS Logistics Carriers (ELCs) or share larger platforms called External Stowage Platforms which also hold science experiments. Both kinds of pallets have electricity as many parts which could be damaged by the cold of space require heating. The larger logistics carriers also have computer local area network connections (LAN) and telemetry to connect experiments. A heavy emphasis on stocking the USOS with ORU's occurred around 2011, {{before the end of}} the NASA shuttle programme, as its commercial replacements, Cygnus and Dragon, carry one tenth to one quarter the payload.|$|E
25|$|But {{these efforts}} {{have not been}} as {{successful}} as hoped. Out of necessity most of the fleet, 330 standard bus equivalents out of 506, were replaced {{in just two years}} in 1985-6. (Standard bus equivalents factor the 30-foot and 60-foot into their equivalent capacity in 40-foot buses). And seven years passed without any new buses coming on board before Muni started its next full diesel fleet replacement cycle in 1999. This was fourteen years after the previous cycle instead of the twelve years that buses are designed to last. Muni is now aware that they must expect to keep diesel buses past their <b>design</b> <b>life</b> and have also found that funds granted for mid-life rebuilds require that the buses be kept longer still. As the fleet replacement cycle begins again in 2013, Muni has arranged for life-extending rebuilds of 142 buses, by count over 30% of the fleet.|$|E
