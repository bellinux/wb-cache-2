40|$|Aim of {{this paper}} is {{mathematical}} analysis of the contribution of fringingeffect in sensing performance of electrostrictive capacitive sensors. Study oncapacitive sensors having separation between plates in nanometric range and areain centimetric range reveals that error due to <b>fringing</b> <b>effect</b> is of the order of 10 - 5 and therefore can be neglected particularly for area greater than 5 x 10 - 4 sqm. Incase of nanometric capacitive sensors having both area of plates and separationbetween them in nanometric range, the percentage error due to <b>fringing</b> <b>effect</b> hasbeen found to be as high as 8. 53 % and therefore cannot be ignored for sensitivityconsideration of capacitive sensors.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{develops}} {{a more precise}} analytical model for calculating salient pole synchronous machine (SPSM) inductances in case of general eccentricity including static, dynamic and mixed eccentricities. The developed method {{is based on the}} modified winding function approach (MWFA) which accurately considers variable air gap function and leads to pure analytical expressions of inductances. Available analytical techniques, based on MWFA, approximate the air gap function and simplify the geometrical model of SPSM, whereas, in this study, the influence of the openings between the rotor salient poles has been taken into account by using an effective form of rotor pole shoes. Using this technique, flux <b>fringing</b> <b>effect</b> is considered. By taking into account machine geometry, type of windings connection and flux <b>fringing</b> <b>effect,</b> this method is able to model most of the important features of an eccentric SPSM. The developed analytical expressions can calculate time varying inductances of SPSMs with any eccentricity type and degree in the frame of a single program. Simulation results for static eccentricity are compared with experimental tests on a laboratory generator to verify accuracy of the proposed model. 1...|$|E

The processing of color filters is compatible with silicon very-large-scale-integrated (VLSI) fabrication. The color filters are also used in liquid crystal display (LCD) for color. It is advantageous to leverage on both the silicon VLSI and LCD infrastructures for this novel but practical CF-LCOS microdisplay. The color filter process on silicon was developed in this dissertation research to achieve 3 μm resolution, 1000 Å flatness and 0. 1 μm alignment accuracy with the pixel array. Mechanical rubbing and photoalignment technology were explored and compared for the LC cell assembly. Important optical and electrical parameters of color filters were extracted to establish an electro-optical model of the CF-LCOS microdisplays for device simulation. Thermal, chemical and light stability characterizations were performed to ensure the stability of color filters and the CF-LCOS microdisplays. A three-dimensional (3 D) optical modeling was further developed to study fringing field effect in small color pixels of the CF-LCOS microdisplays. The simulation results were verified with the experimental ones. With this 3 D optical analysis as a tool, the color <b>fringing</b> <b>effect</b> was analyzed with different display structures. Minimizations of the fringing field effect through pixel arrangement, rubbing direction and LC mode could lead to a CF-LCOS microdisplay of good 63 % NTSC color, 300 : 1 contrast and 23 % optical reflectance.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Modern uses of rotating shafts depend upon bearing speeds and temperatures that exceed normal operating parameters. In order to accommodate these excessive parameters, magnetic bearings have replaced ball or thrust bearings. However, eddy currents cause a loss of power and instability in magnetic bearings. The eddy current magnitude is responsible for the power loss, while the phase lag between the magnetic field and the input or control current causes the instability. This study incorporated finite element studies of magnetic thrust bearings using static bench testing procedures to investigate configurations that promote eddy current reduction. Several rotor/stator configurations, including solid metal, laminated washers, tapewound lam-inates. and solid wedge pieces are used to determine the smallest phase lag configuration.

30|$|In summary, {{we suggest}} {{a kind of}} {{metallic}} planar microlenses, consisting of finite-sized two-dimensional nanohole arrays with a triangular lattice distribution. When the lens size and the spacing between two adjacent microlenses become comparable to the working wavelength, the diffraction effect cannot be ignored anymore, which is normally out of consideration for the conventional microlens arrays. Based on the FDTD numerical simulation method, the focusing performance of the microlenses in an array is investigated in detail as the spacing between adjacent microlenses, the working wavelength, the diameter of microlenses, and the array size are changing. The results show that a larger spacing, a larger lens size, a shorter wavelength, or a smaller array scale {{can lead to a}} weaker focusing coupling effect. This research provides a valuable reference to design an array of metallic planar microlenses and to have a good control over its focusing performance. Nevertheless, a further study on this topic is needed to verify the simulation results by the experiments, and also some other problems like the polarization-related coupling and the <b>fringing</b> <b>effect</b> of the focusing remain to be investigated further.
