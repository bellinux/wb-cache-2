5|$|In 1933, Maxwell {{acted as}} a defence witness {{in the trial of}} Alfred Jamieson, who was accused of <b>housebreaking.</b> Maxwell was Jamieson's former platoon {{commander}} and testified that Jamieson had been of good character but had been strongly affected by the war.|$|E
5|$|The 1773 {{papers of}} George III contain details of Pitfour {{accompanying}} Lord Justice Clerk Thomas Miller on the Northern Circuit {{from the end}} of April until 20 May. Among the cases heard were the trial of a servant accused of murdering another servant on Skye, and the case of Edward Shaw McIntosh, a Borlum gentleman of rank who together with his brother and some of their servants was accused of several instances of <b>housebreaking</b> which had escalated to murder and highway robbery. Some of the gang was caught, but McIntosh remained an outlaw.|$|E
25|$|In some states, a {{burglary}} committed during {{the hours of}} daylight is technically not burglary, but <b>housebreaking.</b> In many jurisdictions in the U.S., burglary is punished more severely than <b>housebreaking.</b> In California, for example, burglary was punished as burglary in the first degree, while <b>housebreaking</b> was punished as burglary in the second degree. California now distinguishes between entry into a residence and into a commercial building, with the burglary of a residence bearing heavier punishment.|$|E
50|$|The {{evidence}} {{indicated that}} the appellant, Antonio de Oliveira, and his wife, a certain Mrs Cordeiro, {{lived in a house}} in a dangerous area where robberies and <b>housebreakings</b> were not uncommon. Their house, however, was secure and burglar-proofed.|$|R
50|$|Having {{experienced}} an upsurge in residential <b>housebreakings</b> {{during the first}} half of 2009, residents banded together to form the Gillitts Park Streetwatch. This organisation is a 'Neighbourhood Watch'-type structure, with the additional function of re-creating a sense of community and maintaining the beautiful environment of the area.|$|R

They only go where they know they can find a certain amount of spoil, and where they can get it without much danger. I don't think housebreakers ever cut throats in these days. They're too fond of their own." [...] Then they both agreed that if these rumours of <b>housebreakings</b> were continued, they would send away the plate some day to be locked up in safe keeping at Salisbury. After that they went to bed.|$|R
25|$|In {{the cities}} and large towns their systems of patrols and beats were {{designed}} to coincide with times of local crime peaks. A survey of 200 commendations issued to members include the detection of such crimes as <b>housebreaking,</b> larceny, dangerous driving, saving of life from burning buildings, assistance to Garda√≠ in need of assistance and others.|$|E
25|$|Burglary (also called {{breaking}} and entering and sometimes <b>housebreaking)</b> is an unlawful entry into a building or other location {{for the purposes of}} committing an offence. Usually that offence is theft, but most jurisdictions include others within the ambit of burglary. To engage in the act of burglary is to burgle (in British English) or to burglarize (in American English).|$|E
25|$|Under Scots law, {{the crime}} of {{burglary}} does not exist. Instead theft by <b>housebreaking</b> covers theft where {{the security of the}} building is overcome. It does not include any other aspect of burglary found in England and Wales. It is a crime usually prosecuted under solemn procedure in a superior court. Another common law crime still used is Hamesuken, which covers forced entry into a building where a serious assault on the occupant takes place. Common law crimes in Scotland are gradually being replaced by statutes.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the years}} accusations {{of a range}} of {{criminal}} activity not linked to football has been levelled towards the CCS as a whole as well as individuals within it. The police have been quoted in the Scottish press as stating the gang (or its members) have carried out or are responsible for organising armed robberies, shoplifting sprees, street muggings, <b>housebreakings,</b> protection rackets, extortionism, drug dealing and murders as well as continuous public order offences around night life in pubs and clubs. This led to their inclusion in a Home Office Affairs Committee investigation into football hooligan gangs activity in the UK in the early 1990s.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} six months of 2009, we have seen an upsurge in <b>housebreakings</b> in the area. Traditionally an out-of-the-way neighbourhood, Gillitts Park has been largely spared the crime {{problems}} that the rest of the country has experienced. The recent upsurge in incidents has led to the formation of a neighbourhood watch association. Called the Gillitts Park Streetwatch, this organisation is composed of residents who have contracted a service provider to provide cellphone communications links between members. By watching out for each other and working with local law enforcement, the 860-home neighbourhood saw nine arrests of housebreakers in four weeks. The crime rate has since dropped off.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the crime}} threat in Bangkok is {{relatively}} low, non-confrontational crimes of opportunity such as pick-pocketing, purse-snatching, {{and credit card}} fraud occur with frequency. Bangkok's growth since the 1960s has been followed by increasing crime rates partly driven by urbanisation, migration, unemployment and poverty. By the late 1980s, Bangkok's crime rates were about four {{times that of the}} rest of the country. The police have long been preoccupied with street crimes ranging from <b>housebreaking</b> to assault and murder. The 1990s saw the emergence of vehicle theft and organized crime, particularly by foreign gangs. Drug trafficking, especially that of ya ba methamphetamine pills, is also chronic.|$|E
25|$|According {{to police}} statistics, {{the most common}} {{complaint}} received by the Metropolitan Police Bureau in 2010 was <b>housebreaking,</b> with 12,347 cases. This was followed by 5,504 cases of motorcycle thefts, 3,694 cases of assault and 2,836 cases of embezzlement. Serious offences included 183 murders, 81 gang robberies, 265 robberies, 1 kidnapping and 9 arson cases. Offences against the state were by far more common, and included 54,068 drug-related cases, 17,239 cases involving prostitution and 8,634 related to gambling. The Thailand Crime Victim Survey conducted by the Office of Justice Affairs of the Ministry of Justice found that 2.7 percent of surveyed households reported a member being victim of a crime in 2007. Of these, 96.1 percent were crimes against property, 2.6 percent were crimes against life and body, and 1.4 percent were information-related crimes.|$|E
25|$|The {{view that}} {{aggressive}} characteristics are inherently {{a part of}} wolfdog temperament has been contested {{in recent years by}} wolfdog breeders and other advocates of wolfdogs as pets. Proponents of wolfdogs as pets say that the higher wolf-content animals are naturally timid and fearful of humans, but that with proper human association, training, and responsible ownership nearly all wolfdogs can become good companions, especially if their association and training begins at an early age. Even in cases of wolfdogs displaying consistently dog-like behavior, they may occasionally retain some wolf-like behavior such as digging dens, chewing up household items, climbing fences, and, to varying degrees, displaying some difficulty in <b>housebreaking</b> in relation to how high their wolf genetic content is. Low wolf-content wolfdogs rarely have these problems any more strongly or significantly than any other large-breed dog.|$|E
25|$|Cokayne now {{began to}} acquire a degree of {{influence}} and recognition in Deryshire society. In March 1392 he received a commission of array. In February 1393 he received a commission of arrest to pursue a fugitive in a case brought to attention by his uncle John. Rituals of social solidarity and political responsibility did not make Cokayne markedly less inclined to consort with criminals. In May John Cokayn, probably the uncle, obtained a pardon for a man involved in a rampage of <b>housebreaking</b> and murder at Ashbourne. Although there is no suggestion in the text that Sir John himself was present on this occasion, the list of those involved overlaps substantially with that of his cronies who had terrorised the area in 1388, including Edmund Harthill, presumably a cousin. Moreover, when Sir John was returned to Parliament {{for the first time}} in 1395, he had another indictment for felony hanging over him. While he was at Westminster he had the case transferred to Derbyshire by a writ of nisi prius, which covered also Thomas Lache and William Walsh, both of Normanton, presumably his accomplices. The other knight of the shire in 1395 was Peter Melbourne or Fauconer, a one-time MP who was a close and devoted adherent of Gaunt. It was rare for the Derbyshire gentry to send two inexperienced men to Parliament: generally at least one would have served before.|$|E
500|$|The {{attack on}} Edward Evans was {{witnessed}} by Hindley's 17-year-old brother-in-law, David Smith, {{the husband of}} her younger sister Maureen. The Hindley family had not approved of Maureen's marriage to Smith, who had several criminal convictions, including actual bodily harm and <b>housebreaking,</b> the first of which, wounding with intent, occurred when he was 11. Throughout the previous year Brady had been cultivating a friendship with Smith, who had become [...] "in awe" [...] of the older man, something that increasingly worried Hindley, as she felt it compromised their safety.|$|E
500|$|The team faces many {{diagnostic}} difficulties from patients' concealment of symptoms, circumstances, {{or personal}} histories, so House frequently proclaims during the team's deliberations, [...] "The patient is lying", or mutters [...] "Everybody lies"; such an assumption guides House's decisions and diagnoses, {{and makes the}} countermeasure of <b>housebreaking</b> a routine procedure. Because many of his hypotheses are based on epiphanies or controversial insights, he often has trouble obtaining permission for medical procedures he considers necessary from his superior, who {{in all but the}} final season is hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy. This is especially the case when the proposed procedures involve a high degree of risk or are ethically questionable. Frequent disagreements occur between House and his team, especially Dr. Allison Cameron, whose standards of medical ethics are more conservative than those of the other characters.|$|E
500|$|Ian Brady {{was born}} in Glasgow as Ian Duncan Stewart on 2 January 1938 to Margaret [...] "Peggy" [...] Stewart, an {{unmarried}} tea room waitress. The identity of Brady's father has never been reliably ascertained, although his mother {{said he was a}} reporter working for a Glasgow newspaper, who died three months before Brady was born. Stewart had little support, and after a few months was forced to give her son into the care of Mary and John Sloan, a local couple with four children of their own. Brady took their name, and became known as Ian Sloan. His mother continued to visit him throughout his childhood. Various authors have stated that he tortured animals, although Brady objected to such accusations. Aged nine, he visited Loch Lomond with his family, where he reportedly discovered an affinity for the outdoors, and a few months later the family moved to a new council house on an overspill estate at Pollok. He was accepted for Shawlands Academy, a school for above-average pupils. At Shawlands his behaviour worsened; as a teenager he twice appeared before a juvenile court for <b>housebreaking.</b> He left the academy aged 15, and {{took a job as a}} tea boy at a Harland and Wolff shipyard in Govan. Nine months later, he began working as a butcher's messenger boy. He had a girlfriend, Evelyn Grant, but their relationship ended when he threatened her with a flick knife after she visited a dance with another boy. He again appeared before the court, this time with nine charges against him, and shortly before his 17th birthday he was placed on probation, on condition that he live with his mother. By then she had moved to Manchester and married an Irish fruit merchant named Patrick Brady, and it was the latter who got Brady a job as a fruit porter at Smithfield Market.|$|E

2500|$|On June 20, 2006, seven Marines and a Navy Corpsman of Kilo Company {{were charged}} with the April 26, 2006, murder of {{disabled}} Iraqi civilian Hashim Ibrahim Awad, an event {{referred to as the}} [...] "Hamdania incident". All eight face additional charges of kidnapping, conspiracy, larceny, assault and <b>housebreaking</b> or unlawfully entering a dwelling. Five of the men are accused of making a false official statement.|$|E
2500|$|Serious Young Insects {{had formed}} in 1980 with Peter Farnan on vocals and guitar, Michael Vallance on vocals and bass guitar and Mark White on vocals and drums. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, {{described}} Serious Young Insects as a [...] "quirky, three-piece Melbourne new wave band". They issued an album, <b>Housebreaking</b> (May 1982), and three singles. Lisa Perry of The Canberra Times praised the album [...] "several times I {{had to check}} the cover {{to see if there}} were not also some session musos or others contributing to the sounds I was hearing. For a three-piece combo, these lads sure make a good sound". Pleasance, a classically trained guitarist, was a fan and briefly joined the group before it broke up in the following year.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} found usage, {{according to}} Quinion, is from 9 April 1829 {{in the court}} papers of the Old Bailey {{in the trial of}} 17-year-old John Daly who was charged with <b>housebreaking.</b> It appears in the transcript once as blake and once as bloke. In 1839, H. Brandon included it in his book Poverty, Mendacity and Crime but spelled it bloak and defined it as [...] "a gentleman". An accused poacher from Cobham, Surrey however, testifying in a court case reported in The Times in 1839, glosses the meaning merely as [...] "a man". After the early 1850s, the term becomes more widely used in literature including by Henry Mayhew and George Augustus Sala to mean a man of any class, which is the meaning most popular today. The OED adds a specialist usage in naval slang from 1914 onwards for the commander of a warship, shown as [...] "the Bloke" [...] with a capital [...] "B" [...] in its examples.|$|E
2500|$|The same day, Deputy Minister for Women, Children and People with Disabilities Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu admitted, [...] "In the process, and in {{the speed}} of the event, a mistake happened." [...] However, she {{rejected}} the view that Jantjie was a fraud, stating, [...] "we should not say that he is a fake interpreter because he does have a basic sign language translation qualification. He started off very well and got tired in the process ... e has interpreted to deaf people in court before and is able to communicate with his deaf friends very well. It's just that (on that day) he did not sign what was expected of him." [...] The South African news broadcaster eNCA alleges that between 1994 and 2003 Jantjie was charged, but not sentenced, for various crimes ranging from rape and <b>housebreaking</b> to attempted murder and kidnapping. According to the report he was sentenced to three years in prison for theft but the other charges were dropped as he was judged ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1984, Wright {{was charged}} with {{attempted}} <b>housebreaking,</b> days after attending Westmount drug rehabilitation centre. He was arrested for heroin use later that month. He had been using heroin since about 1973, and, according to Wright, he remained an addict for 20 years. The Easybeats reformed for a brief Australian tour in 1986, and Wright re-formed variations of the Stevie Wright Band in 1986‚Äì88. Wright's substance abuse problems continued into the 1980s and 1990s and he came close to death on several occasions but was supported by his partner, Fay Walker. His meteoric rise and fall {{has made him a}} frequent media subject. In 1999, journalist Jack Marx published a much-anticipated biography, Sorry - The Wretched Tale of Little Stevie Wright. It was critically applauded by some reviewers. Australian music historian Clinton Walker called it [...] "gonzo journalism at its best". The Bulletin later referred to Sorry as [...] "one of the most harrowing rock books ever written". Sorry was dismissed by Wright, his fans and other critics. Internet reviewer Ken Grady (Luna Kaf√©, 1999) described Marx as [...] "a self serving hypocrite" [...] and concluded his review by observing: [...] "The only thing that Marx has achieved is to depict himself as a very unlikeable, morally bankrupt leech." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Burglars," [...] I said {{to myself}} (one assumes, {{as a matter of}} course, that {{everything}} happening in this world after 1 a.m. is due to burglars), and I reflected what a curiously literal, {{but at the same time}} slow and cumbersome, method of <b>housebreaking</b> they had adopted.|$|E
60|$|The doctor seemed expecially {{troubled by}} {{the fact of the}} robbery having been unexpected, and {{attempted}} in the night-time; {{as if it were the}} established custom of gentlemen in the <b>housebreaking</b> way to transact business at noon, and to make an appointment, by post, a day or two previous.|$|E
60|$|When Abel Bones seated {{himself that}} night in a third-class {{carriage}} at Charing Cross, and placed a neat little black hand-bag, in which he carried his <b>housebreaking</b> tools, on the floor between his feet, a small negro boy entered the carriage behind him, and, sitting down directly opposite, stared {{at him as if}} lost in unutterable amazement.|$|E
60|$|And now, for {{the first}} time, Oliver, well-nigh mad with grief and terror, saw that <b>housebreaking</b> and robbery, if not murder, were the objects of the expedition.

6000|$|... "I {{want you}} as {{a witness to the}} assault Busby made on me; and then, you see, you're all housebreakers"--he waved his hand toward the front window, from which the screen had been torn and the glass broken--"and <b>housebreaking</b> is pretty serious {{business}} even in this country. Furthermore, you were all concerned in that raid, and I'm going to see that you all feel the full weight of the law." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} induce {{him to give}} me a small sum on account. I was about to take terrible risks, remember; <b>housebreaking,</b> larceny, theft--call it what you will, it meant the police correctionelle and a couple of years in New Orleans for sure. He finally gave me fifty francs, and once more {{threatened}} to take his business elsewhere, so I had to accept and to look as urbane and dignified as I could.|$|E
6000|$|... "He took my tip, and I didn't see {{him again}} at that restaurant. I kept my eye on the paper, but the Westminster Bank thief was never discovered, and success, no doubt, gave him confidence. Anyhow, I read {{of two or three}} burglaries that winter which I unhesitatingly put down to Mr. Joseph--I suppose there's style in <b>housebreaking,</b> as in other things--and early the next spring an {{exciting}} bit of business occurred, which I knew to be his work by the description of the man.|$|E
60|$|Thomas {{suggested}} {{breaking in}} doors and carrying Prissy off boldly, but I {{could see that}} Mr. Leonard looked very dubious over that, and even Stephen said he thought {{it could only be}} done as a last resort. I agreed with him. I knew Emmeline Strong would bring an action against him for <b>housebreaking</b> as likely as not. She'd be so furious she'd stick at nothing if we gave her any excuse. Then Anne Shirley, who couldn't have been more excited if she was getting married herself, came to the rescue again.|$|E
