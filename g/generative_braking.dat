40|$|In {{order to}} improve energy {{utilization}} rate of battery-powered electric vehicle (EV) using brushless DC machine (BLDCM), the model of braking current generated by regenerative braking and control method are discussed. On {{the basis of the}} equivalent circuit of BLDCM during the <b>generative</b> <b>braking</b> period, the mathematic model of braking current is established. By using an extended state observer (ESO) to observe actual braking current and the unknown disturbances of regenerative braking system, the autodisturbances rejection controller (ADRC) for controlling the braking current is developed. Experimental results show that the proposed method gives better recovery efficiency and is robust to disturbances...|$|E
40|$|Background Much {{research}} in the field of energy harvesting has sought to develop devices capable of generating electricity during daily activities with minimum user effort. No previous study has considered the metabolic cost of carrying the harvester when determining the energetic ef-fects it has on the user. When considering device carrying costs, no energy harvester to date has demonstrated the ability to generate a substantial amount of electricity (> 5 W) while maintaining a user effort at the same level or lower than conventional power genera-tion methods (e. g. hand crank generator). Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a lower limb-driven energy harvester that is able to generate approximately 9 W of electricity. To quantify the performance of the harvester, we introduced a new perfor-mance measure, total cost of harvesting (TCOH), which evaluates a harvester’s overall effi-ciency in generating electricity including the device carrying cost.

To quantify the performance of the harvester, we introduced a new performance measure, total cost of harvesting (TCOH), which evaluates a harvester's overall efficiency in generating electricity including the device carrying cost. The new harvester captured the motion from both lower limbs and operated in the <b>generative</b> <b>braking</b> mode to assist the knee flexor muscles in slowing the lower limbs. From a testing on 10 participants under different walking conditions, the harvester achieved an average TCOH of 6. 1, which is comparable to the estimated TCOH for a conventional power generation method of 6. 2. When generating 5. 2 W of electricity, the TCOH of the lower limb-driven energy harvester (4. 0) is lower than that of conventional power generation methods. These results demonstrated that the lower limb-driven energy harvester is an energetically effective option for generating electricity during daily activities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Biomechanical energy {{harvesting}} from human motion presents a promising clean alternative to electrical power supplied by batteries for {{portable electronic devices}} and for computerized and motorized prosthetics. We present the theory of {{energy harvesting}} from {{the human body and}} describe the amount of energy that can be harvested from body heat and from motions of various parts of the body during walking, such as heel strike; ankle, knee, hip, shoulder, and elbow joint motion; and center of mass vertical motion. Methods We evaluated major motions performed during walking and identified the amount of work the body expends and the portion of recoverable energy. During walking, there are phases of the motion at the joints where muscles act as brakes and energy is lost to the surroundings. During those phases of motion, the required braking force or torque can be replaced by an electrical generator, allowing energy to be harvested at the cost of only minimal additional effort. The amount of energy that can be harvested was estimated experimentally and from literature data. Recommendations for future directions are {{made on the basis of}} our results in combination with a review of state-of-the-art biomechanical energy harvesting devices and energy conversion methods. Results For a device that uses center of mass motion, the maximum amount of energy that can be harvested is approximately 1 W per kilogram of device weight. For a person weighing 80 kg and walking at approximately 4 km/h, the power generation from the heel strike is approximately 2 W. For a joint-mounted device based on <b>generative</b> <b>braking,</b> the joints generating the most power are the knees (34 W) and the ankles (20 W). Conclusions Our theoretical calculations align well with current device performance data. Our results suggest that the most energy can be harvested from the lower limb joints, but to do so efficiently, an innovative and light-weight mechanical design is needed. We also compared the option of carrying batteries to the metabolic cost of harvesting the energy, and examined the advantages of methods for conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy. </p...|$|E
40|$|Battery {{energy storage}} system (ESS) is a major {{component}} of an electric vehicle (EV), as it supplies the entire propulsion power, constitutes a significant share of the EV’s cost and weight, and {{plays a key role in}} EV performance. Consequently, extending the battery lifetime is vital, given that batteries in EV propulsion applications experience accelerated capacity fading due to aggressive traction demand and regenerative braking power spikes. Subsequently, it is beneficial to relieve the battery stress by adopting a hybrid energy storage scheme that combines the battery pack with an auxiliary energy storage device of high specific power such as supercapacitor (SC). The SC is used as a power buffer to process the high-frequency component of the traction demand and regenerative braking power. There are many topologies through which the battery and SC can be interfaced with the DC bus. Two partially-decoupled topologies have proved to be the most promising candidate topologies for a hybrid {{energy storage system}} (HESS). In the first HESS topology, the battery is connected directly to the DC bus and the SC is interfaced with the DC bus through a DC/DC converter, whereas in the second topology, the SC is connected directly to the DC bus and the battery is interfaced with the DC bus through a DC/DC converter with a bypass diode. Comparative assessment of these topologies in terms of battery capacity fading based on a qualitative analysis is unclear and inconclusive. Therefore, a quantitative analysis is necessary to assess the pros and cons of these HESS topologies in comparison with one another. Generally, HESS is most effective in urban drive cycles rather than highway drive cycles, due to the more frequent occurrence and higher intensity of regenerative braking in urban drive cycles, as the SC is dedicated to processing the <b>generative</b> <b>braking</b> energy. From the study reported in this thesis, it is observed that the second topology is superior to the first topology in extending the battery lifetime. For the same battery pack size in the second HESS topology and battery-only ESS, the battery lifetime in HESS is extended by 18, 4. 5, and 8. 7 % for urban, highway, and urban-highway hybrid drive cycles, respectively, with respect to battery-only ESS. However, for battery-only ESS with an extended battery pack with a monetary value equivalent to that of the second HESS topology, the battery pack lifetime of the former is longer than the latter. In this thesis, an onboard integrated charger scheme is proposed, which eliminates the active rectifier in the original onboard charger, yielding significant cost savings. In the integrated charger scheme, the traction inverter and HESS DC/DC converter are used to realize the two-stage charger topology. Also, two single- pole-double-throw (SPDT) switches are added between the traction inverter and motor, which connect the inverter to the motor during propulsion and to the charger outlet during charging. Further, it is observed that HESS lifetime is about 4 % higher compared to that of the battery-only ESS with and extended battery pack, where the monetary value of battery pack extension is equal to the cost of the SC minus the cost of the original active rectifier...|$|E
