5|$|Among {{the issues}} that the Mint Bureau had to face in 1933 and 1934 was the calling-in of most gold coins. When the Treasury Department issued {{regulations}} allowing such coins to be surrendered at branches of the Federal Reserve Bank, O'Reilly sent out a memorandum over <b>her</b> <b>signature</b> as acting director noting that the Fed had no facilities to accept any gold other than bars with a government stamp. At the time, the Mint Bureau {{was one of the}} lowest-status branches of the Department of the Treasury, esteemed far less than the Secret Service and other law enforcement-related agencies that fell under the Treasury Secretary. Burdette points out that the gold regulations showed a lack of basic Mint knowledge both by Roosevelt's appointees and the holdover senior officials from the Hoover administration.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Minogue {{released}} her sixth studio album, Impossible Princess. The album represented a drastic {{change in the}} singer's musical direction, shifting from <b>her</b> <b>signature</b> dance-pop styles to incorporate elements of electronica and pop rock. It was her second album to be released on British record label Deconstruction and became a success in her native Australia, peaking at number four on the ARIA Albums Chart. In the United Kingdom Impossible Princess was less successful than Minogue's previous albums and peaked at number ten on the UK Albums Chart. The album also suffered from poor reviews in the UK as commentators criticised its different musical approach; many also considered that Minogue's career was over. Despite embarking on a successful promotional tour, Minogue was dropped by Deconstruction in 1999. Minogue then signed to Parlophone, another British record label.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{just before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II, there was {{a revival of the}} hooped crinoline from designers such as Edward Molyneux, who put hoops in both day skirts and evening gowns, and Norman Hartnell, whose late 1930s Winterhalter-inspired crinoline designs for Queen Elizabeth were so successful that the Queen is popularly (if inaccurately) credited with having single-handedly brought crinolines back into fashion. Both as Queen, and as the Queen Mother, Elizabeth adopted the traditional bell-shaped crinoline as <b>her</b> <b>signature</b> look for evening wear and state occasions. The film Gone With The Wind, released in 1939, inspired the American fashion for prom dresses with crinolines in Spring 1940.|$|E

Lara, Jonah, and Reyes give chase, heading up a river in the fixed boat to the monastery, with Lara arriving {{just in time to}} see Mathias trick Whitman into approaching and speaking to some of Stormguards, who kill him. After fighting her way through both the Solarii and the Stormguard, Lara arrives at the top of the monastery where Mathias is performing the Ascension ritual. Lara fights her way to the central platform, and after a struggle, shoots Mathias off the platform to his death using both his pistol and her own in <b>her</b> <b>signature</b> dual-wielding style. Despite Mathias' death, the ritual is already underway, with Himiko's soul starting to pour into Sam. Lara then destroys Himiko's ancient remains, saving Sam and dispersing the storms.|$|E

5|$|The album {{revealed}} {{a more personal}} side of the singer, illustrated in its declarative theme of emancipation from her previous marriage, and from her personal and professional setbacks. Although it shared similar vocal production {{as well as an}} inclination to <b>her</b> <b>signature</b> pop and R ballads, the album also encompassed a variety of dance-oriented and uptempo styles. It {{was meant to be a}} continuation, or a second part of her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Carey collaborated with a number of artists on the album, including T-Pain, Damian Marley and Young Jeezy. Though considered by critics very similar to the formula its predecessor had been built on, E=MC² included other genres she had never explored, such as reggae, and her continued recording of gospel-influenced hymns.|$|E

Laveaux and Love were the first to enter the cage, with Laveaux gaining the pinfall after <b>her</b> <b>signature</b> Voodoo Drop maneuver to become the first-ever Queen of the Cage and become number one contender to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship.|$|E
5|$|The fourth match (which {{received}} a pre-match endorsement from Stephanie McMahon) featured Paige retaining her NXT Women's Championship over Emma. Paige managed to prevent Emma from applying her Emma Lock submission hold during the match and also withstood several other holds applied by Emma. When Paige attempted a superplex, Emma countered with a sitout powerbomb on Paige, {{but it was}} not enough to secure a win. A frustrated Emma slapped Paige, who retaliated with <b>her</b> <b>signature</b> Paige Turner. Yet, Emma became the first person to kick out of the Paige Turner. Paige responded by applying the Paige Tapout submission hold, which was enough for the victory when Emma submitted. Paige embraced Emma after the match.|$|E
50|$|A handstand {{variation}} {{can also}} be used. With the opponent seated on the top turnbuckle facing the ring, the wrestler performs a handstand on the bottom turnbuckle, wrapping his or her shins or feet {{around the neck of}} the opponent. The wrestler then bends his or her legs forward towards the ring, pulling the opponent over and flipping him or her down to the mat onto his or her back. Former WWE wrestler Trish Stratus used this variation of the move as one of <b>her</b> <b>signatures,</b> calling it the Stratusphere.|$|R

5|$|The seventh {{match was}} the 14-Diva single-fall Vickie Guerrero Divas Championship Invitational for the WWE Divas Championship; this marked {{the only time}} the title was defended at WrestleMania. The match started with the other wrestlers attacking {{champion}} AJ Lee and her bodyguard, Tamina Snuka. As the match progressed, Aksana met Naomi at the top rope and Natalya slipped under Aksana to perform a powerbomb superplex combination. Tamina pulled Aksana out of the ring to prevent Natalya from winning, so Natalya clotheslined Tamina on the outside but was prevented from re-entering the ring due to AJ kicking her. AJ applied <b>her</b> <b>signature</b> Black Widow hold on Naomi and won the match, thus retaining her title. WWE reported that AJ won by moving Naomi's hand unto the mat to deceive the referee into thinking that Naomi had submitted.|$|E
5|$|As for the Street Fighter series, {{starting}} from Street Fighter X Tekken, Poison {{has a unique}} moveset of her own that mixes agile Pro Wrestling techniques and her own streetfighting abilities. Poison's standard throws include a multi-hitting slap and a Frankensteiner, Aeolus Edge and Kissed by a Goddess which are the names of her Fireball and Shoryuken-like moves, and Whip of Love which is a multi-hitting whip attack and is done {{in a similar fashion}} to Fei Long's Rekkas. Her famous flip kick from the original Final Fight games appears as a special called Love Me Tender. After the flipping axe kick, Poison can follow this move up with a reverse Frankensteiner (Poison-Rana). In addition, Poison's Super Art is called Love Storm, and starts with her charging a large version of Aeolus Edge. Once it hits, she flips into the air and lands with a hard hitting axe kick that stuns the opponent in a prone position. Afterwards, she repeatedly smacks the opponent with her horse whip and delivers a final blow that knocks them into the air. Poison also retained <b>her</b> <b>signature</b> backflip from the original game.|$|E
