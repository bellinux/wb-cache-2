40|$|Introduction In the nonparametric {{regression}} context, {{the notion}} of asymptotic optimality usually associates with the "optimal rate of convergence". Minimax rates of convergence have been extensively studied (Ibragimov and Hasminskii (1980), (1982); Stone (1980), (1982) and many others). Different estimators {{turn out to be}} optimal {{in the sense of the}} best rate of convergence. We mention only some of them: kernel estimators (Ibragimov and Hasminskii (1980), Korostelev (1993)), projection estimators (Ibragimov and Hasminskii (1981)), spline estimators (Speckman (1985), Nussbaum (1985)), wavelets (Donoho and Johnstone (1992)). From the practical point of view stochastic approximation estimators considered in Belitser and Korostelev (1992) are also of interest. However, comparing estimators on the basis of their rates of convergence does not make it possible to distinguish among estimators optimal <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>sence.</b> Also from a more practical point of view, such approach does not giv...|$|R

The paper contains references on corpus-based descriptive studies and dictionaries of Judeo-Spanish language. Aspecial emphasis is uttached to the studies on Judeo-Spanish language on the territories of former Yugoslavia, which are classified geographically. The studies on the language of Sephardi Jews deal with this Romance Ianguage from different linguistic(s) perspectives. First of all, we presented the Hispanic studies on Judeo-Spanish that examine {{it as one of}} the modern Hispanicvarieties, consider it {{to be one of the}} sources of knowledge about the history of Spanish language or look at it from the sociolinguistic point of view.

The actual Situation of Judeo-Spanish is presented with a short account of today's magazines and institutions dedicated to the preservation of Sephardi language and culture. Being the language an intrinsic part of fhe culture in which it arises and lives, we presented also the works dedicated to Sephardi culture and history of the communities in the Orient. Regarding the linguistic corpora in Judeo-Spanish, we presented the data on books published in Hebrew alphabet, collections of Songs, stories and sayings from Sephardi oral tradition, among which a Special importance has the Sephardi Romansero.

Some authors studied mixed oligopolies under Cournot competition (firms move simultaneously) and some others considered Stackelberg models (firms move sequentially). Tomaru [1] analyzed, in a Cournot model, how decision-making upon cost-reducing R&D investment by a domestic public firm is affected by privatization when competing in the domestic market with a foreign firm. He shows that privatization of the domestic public firm lowers productive efficiency and deteriorates domestic social welfare. In this paper, we examine the same question but in a Stackelberg formulation instead of Cournot. The model is a three-stage game. In the first stage, the domestic firm chooses the amount of cost-reducing R&D investment. Then, the firms compete à la Stackelberg. Two cases are considered: (i) The domestic firm is the leader; (ii) The foreign firm is the leader.

40|$|Draft chapter {{contributed to}} the book "Towards quantum gravity", being {{prepared}} by Daniele Oriti for Cambridge University Press. 19 pgsThe problem of background independent quantum gravity {{is the problem of}} defining a quantum field theory of matter and gravity {{in the absence of an}} underlying background geometry. Loop quantum gravity (LQG) is a promising proposal for addressing this difficult task. Despite the steady progress of the field, dynamics remains to a large extend an open issue in LQG. Here we present the main ideas behind a series of proposals for addressing the issue of dynamics. We refer to these constructions as the spin foam representation of LQG. This set of ideas can be viewed as a systematic attempt at the construction of the path integral representation of LQG. The spin foam representation is mathematically precise in 2 + 1 dimensions, so we will start this chapter by showing how it arises in the canonical quantization of this simple theory. This toy model will be used to precisely describe the true geometric meaning of the histories that are summed over in the path integral of generally covariant theories. In four dimensions similar structures appear. We call these constructions spin foam models as their definition is incomplete <b>in</b> the <b>sence</b> <b>that</b> at least one of the following issues remains unclear: 1) the connection to a canonical formulation, and 2) regularization independence (renormalizability).

The methods are applied to a model isomerisation of Li 2 Na {{as well as to the}} hydrogen transfer in thiomalonaldehyde. The thesis is devided into a technical, a methodological and an application part. Since theoretical investigations of the dynamics of quantum systems require the expensive numerical solution of the Schrdinger equation, the technical part describes the parallelisation of algorithms for molecular wave packet dynamics. The developed algorithms provide a very good performance, since they scale approximately linear with the number of processors involved. The methodological part treats algorithms for computing laser pulses, which drive quantum systems from an initial state to a target state. The main result here is the incorporation of experimental requirements into the computation of the laser pulses. Taking into account these requirements leads for the first time to algorithmically optimized laser pulses close to todays experimental feasibility. As a guide to experimental realization of the computed laser fields, a scheme is presented, which decomposes the optimal laser field into sub-fields, which give a good approximation of the initial optimal field when superposed in a multi-colour experiment. As an application for the algorithms the photoisomerization of Li 2 Na is treated. In the electronic ground state Li 2 Na has two isomers in shape of an acute and an obtuse triangle. For treating this system, ab-initio potential energy surfaces of the electronic ground state and electronically excited states are calculated. The isomerisation is then driven by optimal laser pulses from the acute form on the electronic ground state via the third electronically excited state to the obtuse isomer. The simulations of this isomerisation clearly show the superiority of algorithmically optimized laser fields to `hand optimized´ ones, <b>in</b> the <b>sence</b> <b>that</b> they give both a higher quantum yield and a higher state selectivity. When applying the algorithms to the laser-induced hydrogen transfer in thiomalonealdehyde, it can be seen that they can also be used as a tool for finding new reaction paths. A new strategy for controling the hydrogen transfer in the thiomalonaldehyde by laser pulses is obtained. In contrast to the conventional approach, which drives the hydrogen over the potential barrier from the oxygen atom to the sulfur atom, the new reaction path is a laser driven tunnelling of the hydrogen through the barrier. The tunnelling approach allows the control of the hydrogen transfer in a more robust way with regard to the dissipative environment; in addition, a lower laser field intesity is needed, thus avoiding ionisation of the molecule. The appendices contain an extended method for the quantum control of expectation values, a method for computing the eigenstates of large hamiltonian matrices and as an additional application the selective vibrational excitation of the K 2 dimer by means of `stimulated emission pumping´. <P...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a phenomenological {{investigation of the}} evolution and large scale distribution of quasars using {{a modified version of}} the Field and Colgate gravitational contraction model for proto-galaxies. By studying the distribution of about 7000 quasars in 5 luminosity classes, it seems that, such a model is capable of solving the energy problem and discussing some of the observational properties of these objects. A sketch of luminosity function of the quasars and the normal galaxies shows a unified aspect for these objects. The large scale distribution of the quasars in the galactic coordinate shows the existence of filamentary structures and voids <b>in</b> the same <b>sence</b> <b>that</b> have been resolved by exploring the clusters of galaxies.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the Dagpengereform of 2010, we {{investigate}} the effects of the institutional econom-ic sense, upon the design of Danish labour market policy. The investigation of the Dagpengereform ought to exemplify a general tendency within the decision-making process of the Danish labour market policy. The study is based upon Ove K. Pedersen’s, professor at Copenhagen Business School, theoretical depiction of the government’s development from a welfare-state to that of a competitive state. In determining whether this development affects the organisation of labour market policy – and the influence of labour market political interest groups – we execute an empirical study hereof. In conclusion, we find <b>that</b> the economic <b>sence</b> has caused the government’s economic governance to be confined by a European framework, encompassing restrictions with regard to the Danish gov-ernment debt levels. Thus, the Dagpengereform is utilised as an economic governance instrument and – as a result hereof – the influence of labour market political interest groups has been somewhat reduced. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{approach}} for automatic topology optimization of backpropagation networks. It {{is based on a}} genetic algorithm. In contrast to other approaches it allows that two networks with different number of units can be crossed to a new valid "child" network. We applied this algorithm to a medical classification task, which is extremely difficult to solve. The results confirm, <b>that</b> optimization make <b>sence,</b> because the generated network outperform all fixed topologies. 1 Introduction As Minsky and Papert [1] have shown the XOR [...] problem cannot be solved without a hidden layer. A learning rule which is able to train this kind of networks was developed by Rumelhart et al. [2]. It is known as backpropagation (BP) and {{it is one of the}} most often used neural network paradigms. Hornik [3] proved that every function can be approximated by a neural network with just one hidden layer. By adding "enough" hidden units the approximation error can be made as small as required.
