Once the potter gets the shape he desires, the potter stops the wheel, allowing the access water to run of. The artist then spins it again to ensure the water is off then it is placed in a kiln. The kiln was usually a pit dug {{in the ground and}} heated by fire; these were estimated to reach a temperature of 950 degree Celsius (1,742 degree Fahrenheit). Later kilns were built above ground to be easier to maintain and ventilate.

25|$|Any {{suggestion}} of <b>further</b> <b>reading</b> on Kant {{has to take}} cognizance {{of the fact that}} his work has dominated philosophy like no other figure after him.

25|$|The {{time of the}} Fifth Dalai Lama, who reigned from 1642 to 1682 {{and founded}} the {{government}} known as the Ganden Phodrang, {{was a period of}} rich cultural development.

The same goes for the great {{increase in the number of}} foreign visitors thronging Lhasa during the period as well as for the number of inventions and institutions that are attributed to the 'Great Fifth', as the Tibetans refer to him. The most dynamic and prolific of the early Dalai Lamas, he composed more literary works than all the other Dalai Lamas combined. Writing on a wide variety of subjects he is specially noted for his works on history, classical Indian poetry in Sanskrit and his biographies of notable personalities of his epoch, as well as his own two autobiographies, one spiritual in nature and the other political (see <b>Further</b> <b>Reading).</b> He also taught and travelled extensively, reshaped the politics of Central Asia, unified Tibet, conceived and constructed the Potala Palace and is remembered for establishing systems of national medical care and education.|$|E
