50|$|In 1856, {{he began}} his epic work, a series called Our Whole Country. It was not issued until the month Fort Sumter <b>fell,</b> <b>marking</b> the {{beginning}} of the Civil War, and people were living history, not reading it. The book was a financial disaster. His Times of the Rebellion in the West, published shortly after the war, was very profitable. In the 1870s he reprinted his older works, and was often asked by influential Ohioans to update his Collections.|$|R

25|$|A Javanese source, the Nagarakretagama canto 15, {{composed}} in 1365 in the Majapahit Empire, claimed Java had established {{diplomatic relations with}} Kambuja (Cambodia) together with Syangkayodhyapura (Ayutthaya), Dharmmanagari (Negara Sri Dharmaraja), Rajapura (Ratchaburi) and Singhanagari (Songkla), Marutma (Martaban or Mottama, Southern Myanmar), Champa and Yawana (Annam). This record describes the political situations in Mainland Southeast Asia in the mid-14th century; although the Cambodian kingdom still survived, the rise of Siamese Ayutthaya had taken its toll. Finally, the empire <b>fell,</b> <b>marked</b> by the abandonment of Angkor for Phnom Penh in 1431, caused by Siamese pressure.|$|R
50|$|In 1644, Beijing {{was sacked}} by a {{coalition}} of rebel forces led by Li Zicheng, a minor Ming dynasty official turned leader of a peasant revolt.

The Han Chinese Ming general Wu Sangui and his army then defected to the Qing and allowed them through Shanhai pass. They then seized control of Beijing, overthrowing Li's short-lived Shun dynasty. They then forced Han Chinese to adopt the queue as a sign of submission.|$|R

50|$|Hawthornthwaite Fell {{is one of}} {{the larger}} hills in the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire, England, occupying a north-facing {{position}} on the south-western range, close to Bleasdale and Fair Snape Fell. The only path to the summit comes over the hills from the south. Most of the hill is on the Duke of Westminster's land. The summit is boggy and flanked to the north by steep heather slopes. Grouse are farmed in the area and hen harriers can be seen frequently. The trig point and the remains of its foundations are no longer upright, lying horizontally pointing westward. Hawthornthwaite <b>Fell</b> <b>marks</b> the extreme western limit of the West Riding of the Historic County of York.|$|R
50|$|After the Treaty of Versailles, which {{formally}} ended World War I in 1919, Germany faced {{a damaged}} {{economy and a}} requirement to pay immense war reparations to the Allies. At the beginning of 1921, the German currency was relatively stable at about 60 Marks per US Dollar, but inflation rapidly increased after August 1921, and the <b>Mark</b> <b>fell</b> to less than one third of a cent by November 1921 (approx. 330 Marks per US Dollar). The Mark stabilized again {{at the beginning of}} 1922, but when there was no resolution to the reparations problem the inflation changed to hyperinflation and the <b>Mark</b> <b>fell</b> to 8000 <b>Marks</b> per Dollar by December 1922. The inflation reached its peak by November 1923 when a new currency (the Rentenmark) was introduced.|$|R

50|$|In {{the first}} half of 1922, the mark {{stabilized}} at about 320 marks per dollar. International reparations conferences were being held. One, in June 1922, was organized by US investment banker J. P. Morgan, Jr. The meetings produced no workable solution and so inflation changed to hyperinflation, and the <b>mark</b> <b>fell</b> to 7,400 <b>marks</b> per US dollar by December 1922. The cost-of-living index was 41 in June 1922 and 685 in December, a 15-fold increase.|$|R
5|$|Henry Tufton died in 1849, and castle {{ownership}} fell to Hothfields.

25|$|Sussex was {{the venue}} for the momentous Battle of Hastings, the decisive {{victory in the}} Norman conquest of England. In September 1066, William of Normandy landed with his forces at Pevensey and erected a wooden castle at Hastings, from which they raided the {{surrounding}} area. The battle was fought between Duke William of Normandy and the English king, Harold Godwinson, who had strong connections with Sussex and whose chief seat was probably in Bosham. After having marched his exhausted army {{all the way from}} Yorkshire, Harold fought the Normans at the Battle of Hastings, where England's army was defeated and Harold was killed. It is likely that all the fighting men of Sussex were at the battle, as the county's thegns were decimated and any that survived had their lands confiscated. William built Battle Abbey {{at the site of the}} battle, with the exact spot where Harold <b>fell</b> <b>marked</b> by the high altar.|$|R
5000|$|Grand Duke Ferdinando {{was obsessed}} with new technology, and had several hygrometers, barometers, thermometers, and telescopes {{installed}} in the Pitti. In 1654, influenced by Galileo, he {{is reported to have}} invented the sealed-glass thermometer, by sealing the glass tip of a tube filled to a certain height with colored alcohol. Small glass bubbles filled with air at varying pressures hovered trapped within the liquid, changing positions as the temperature rose or <b>fell.</b> <b>Marked</b> off with 360 divisions, like the gradations or [...] "degrees" [...] of a circle, this type of device was called a [...] "spirit thermometer", because it was filled with [...] "spirit of wine" [...] (distilled alcohol) or a [...] "Florentine thermometer" [...] (Florence being the capital of Tuscany). In 1657, Leopoldo de' Medici, the Grand Duke’s youngest brother, established the Accademia del Cimento. It was set up to attract scientists from all over Tuscany to Florence for mutual study.|$|R
