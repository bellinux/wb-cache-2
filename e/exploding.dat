DeMille's 1921 romance Fool's Paradise, wherein {{the main character}} is blinded by an <b>exploding</b> cigar; Laurel and Hardy's Great Guns (1941), which features a gag in which tobacco is replaced by gunpowder; the Elke Sommer vehicle, Deadlier Than the Male (1967), where a murder by <b>exploding</b> cigar is a key plot element; in The Beatles' 1968 animated feature film, Yellow Submarine, where an <b>exploding</b> cigar is used to rebuff a psychedelic boxing monster; the 1984 comedy Top Secret!, in which Omar Sharif's British secret agent character is pranked with an <b>exploding</b> cigar by a blindman; and in the 2005 film V for Vendetta, where the main antagonist's cigar is swapped with an <b>exploding</b> one during a comedy skit.|$|E
5|$|Although far rarer {{than their}} prank cousins, <b>exploding</b> cigars {{used as a}} means to kill or attempt to kill targets in real life has been claimed, and is well {{represented}} as a fictional plot device. The most famous case concerning the intentionally deadly variety was an alleged plot by the CIA of the US in the 1960s to assassinate Fidel Castro. Notable real-life incidents involving the non-lethal ilk include an <b>exploding</b> cigar purportedly given by Ulysses S. Grant to an acquaintance and a dust-up between Turkish military officers and Ernest Hemingway after he pranked one of them with an <b>exploding</b> cigar.|$|E
5|$|Both prank and {{intentionally}} deadly <b>exploding</b> cigars {{have been}} featured in numerous works of fiction, spanning many forms of media including literature, film, comics books, cartoons and others. A well-known use of the <b>exploding</b> cigar in literature, for example, appears in Thomas Pynchon's 1973 novel, Gravity's Rainbow. In it, the character Etzel Ölsch symbolically betrays his death wish by eagerly smoking a cigar he knows {{to be of the}} prank explosive variety. Other book examples include Robert Coover's 1977 novel, The Public Burning, where a fictionalized Richard Nixon hands an <b>exploding</b> cigar to Uncle Sam, and Sherburne James' Death's Clenched Fist (1982), in which a Tammany Hall politico of the 1890s is murdered with an <b>exploding</b> cigar.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} <b>exploding</b> cigars were being turned out by {{manufacturers}} such as Adams and Appel, the chemical explosive variety {{had fallen out}} of favor. According to Adams, the large-scale switch to a non-chemical device occurred in approximately 1915 {{in the aftermath of a}} death caused by a homemade <b>exploding</b> cigar rigged with dynamite. Though <b>exploding</b> cigars were not normally rigged with dynamite but with explosive caps using a less powerful incendiary, following the incident, a number of U.S. states banned the product altogether. The replacement for chemical explosives was a metal spring mechanism, bound with cord—as the victim puffed away, the cord burned through, causing the device to spring open, thus rupturing the cigar's end.|$|E
5|$|An <b>exploding</b> cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit. Such cigars are {{normally}} packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting end or with a non-chemical device that ruptures the cigar when exposed to heat. The customary intended purpose of <b>exploding</b> cigars is {{as a form of}} hostile practical joke, rather than to cause lasting physical harm to the butt of the joke. Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E

With ammunition <b>exploding</b> among the burning wreckage a number of Australians rushed to aid the injured, scrambling through the debris and removing the unexploded ammunition and pulling the survivors to safety. Subsequently, another winch point was established {{to the rear of}} the Australian positions for casualty evacuation and resupply.|$|E

5|$|Ultra-{{stripped}} supernovae {{occur when}} the <b>exploding</b> star has been stripped (almost) {{all the way to}} the metal core, via mass transfer in a close binary. As a result, very little material is ejected from the <b>exploding</b> star (~0.1 MSun). In the most extreme cases, ultra-stripped supernovae can occur in naked metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass limit. SN 2005ek might be an observational example of an ultra-stripped supernova, giving rise to a relatively dim and fast decaying light curve. The nature of ultra-stripped supernovae can be both iron core-collapse and electron capture supernovae, depending on the mass of the collapsing core.|$|E

5|$|Amy and Rory {{discover}} that the wounded Doctor had told his earlier self to create a diversion, allowing him to rig the Pandorica to fly into the TARDIS explosion.

After a tearful farewell to Amy, Rory, and River where he instructs Amy to focus on her family and Rory to restore them in the new universe, the Doctor engages the Pandorica and flies it into the <b>exploding</b> TARDIS. A second Big Bang occurs. The Doctor comes to consciousness and begins witnessing events in his life in reverse as {{the cracks in the}} universe close. The Doctor has to stay outside this new universe in order for that to happen. After a final goodbye to Amelia on the night they met, he enters the cracks and disappears.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Initiated by Gromov in [1], {{the study}} of {{holomorphic}} curves in symplectic manifolds has been a powerfull tool in symplectic topology, however the moduli space of holomorphic curves is often very difficult to find. A common technique is to study the limiting behavior of holomorphic curves in a degenerating family of complex structures which corresponds {{to a kind of}} adiabatic limit. The category of <b>exploded</b> fibrations is an extension of the smooth category in which some of these degenerations can be described as smooth families. The first part of this paper is devoted to defining <b>exploded</b> fibrations and a slightly more specialized category of <b>exploded</b> T fibrations. In section 6 are some examples of holomorphic curves in <b>exploded</b> T fibrations, including a brief discussion of the relationship between tropical geometry and <b>exploded</b> T fibrations. In section 7, it is shown that <b>exploded</b> fibrations have a good intersection theory. In section 8, the perturbation theory of holomorphic curves in <b>exploded</b> T fibrations is sketched. 1...|$|R
