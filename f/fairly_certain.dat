5|$|Property {{losses from}} the fire can be {{accounted}} for with relative certainty as detailed surveys were made immediately afterwards. City surveyor Søren Balle submitted the first survey on 1 November 1728 and on 13 April 1729 the Magistrate of Copenhagen finished a second, made according to a royal request of 12 December 1728. The {{differences between the two}} surveys are limited to the extent of the damages on 43lots, so it is <b>fairly</b> <b>certain</b> that 1,227lots containing about 1,600buildings were lost in flames. All of Copenhagen consisted of about 4,500lots (per the cadastre of 1699), so about 28% of the lots were lost. For the medieval part of town the ratio is 47%.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the veto}} {{question}} became central, the ministers were {{not out of}} the spotlight. Since the ministers were inferior to the King within the executive branch, the King was responsible for all actions conducted by this branch; however, the ministers were responsible for the advice given to the King when they were assembled in the Council of State. If any ministers were to dissent, according to the Constitution, they had to state this explicitly in the meeting protocol, lest they be considered in agreement and thus co-responsible. The King was above the law, but the Prime Minister and his cabinet could be tried for Impeachment for advising the King to act out an unconstitutional veto. The Impeachment Court consisted of Supreme Court Justices and elected politicians from the Lagting, and as the latter group held a two-thirds majority, an Impeachment trial with a <b>fairly</b> <b>certain</b> outcome could start as soon as the liberals won control over the Lagting seats through general elections.|$|E
5|$|The authorship of seventy-three of The Federalist essays is <b>fairly</b> <b>certain.</b> Twelve {{of these}} essays are disputed over by some scholars, though the modern {{consensus}} is that Madison wrote essays Nos. 49–58, with Nos. 18–20 being products of a collaboration between him and Hamilton; No. 64 was by John Jay. The first open designation of which essay belonged to whom was provided by Hamilton, who {{in the days before}} his ultimately fatal gun duel with Aaron Burr provided his lawyer with a list detailing the author of each number. This list credited Hamilton with a full sixty-three of the essays (three of those being jointly written with Madison), almost three-quarters of the whole, and was used as the basis for an 1810 printing that was the first to make specific attribution for the essays.|$|E

25|$|Historians are <b>fairly</b> <b>certain</b> that Findláech was ruling before 1014 {{because the}} Orkneyinga Saga reads {{that before the}} Battle of Clontarf, Jarl Siguðr of Orkney fought a battle with the Scots, who were led by a Jarl Finnlekr (i.e. Findláech the Mormaer). An Irish princess called Eithne made a banner for Siguðr, which had on it a raven. The saga records that Siguðr later brought the banner to Clontarf, where he was killed.

25|$|Based on the Pairi {{inscription}} {{dated to}} her 3rd Regnal Year, it appears she enjoyed a sole reign. How {{much of her}} reign was as coregent and how much as sole ruler {{is a matter of}} debate and speculation. The same tomb inscription mentions an Amun temple in Thebes, perhaps a mortuary complex, which would seem to indicate that the Amun proscription had abated and the traditional religion was being restored towards the end of her reign. Since much of her funeral equipment was used in Tutankhamen's burial, it seems <b>fairly</b> <b>certain</b> she was denied a pharaonic burial by her successor. The reasons for this remain speculation, as does a regency with Tutankhaten.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the Uruk period (c. 4100–2900 BC calibrated), the volume of trade goods transported along the canals and rivers of {{southern}} Mesopotamia facilitated the rise of many large, stratified, temple-centered cities (with populations of over 10,000 people) where centralized administrations employed specialized workers. It is <b>fairly</b> <b>certain</b> that it was during the Uruk period that Sumerian cities began to make use of slave labor captured from the hill country, and there is ample evidence for captured slaves as workers in the earliest texts. Artifacts, and even colonies of this Uruk civilization have been found over a wide area—from the Taurus Mountains in Turkey, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, and as far east as central Iran.|$|E
25|$|Huni's chronological {{position}} as the last king of the third dynasty is seen as <b>fairly</b> <b>certain,</b> {{but there is still}} some uncertainty on the succession order of rulers at the end of 3rdnbsp&dynasty. It is also unclear under which Hellenized name the ancient historian Manetho could have listed him in his historical writing Aegyptiacae. Most possibly he is to be identified with the Hellenized name Aches, as Winfried Barta proposes. Many Egyptologists believe that Huni was the father and direct predecessor of king Sneferu, but this is questioned by other scholars. Huni is seen by scholars as a confusing figure in Egyptian history, because he was long remembered in Egyptian traditions, but only very few documents, objects or monuments have endured.|$|E

25|$|Across the country, Victoria Day {{serves as}} the {{unofficial}} marker {{of the end of}} the winter social season, and thus the beginning of the summer social calendar. Banff, Alberta's Sunshine Village ends its lengthy ski season on Victoria Day and, likewise, it is during this long weekend that many summer businesses—such as parks, outdoor restaurants, bicycle rentals, city tour operators, etc.—will open. Victoria Day is also a mark of the beginning of the cottage season, when cottage owners may reverse the winterization of their property. Gardeners in Canada will similarly regard Victoria Day as the beginning of spring, as it falls at a time when one can be <b>fairly</b> <b>certain</b> that frost will not return until the next autumn. There is also a change in fashion: lighter-coloured summer clothing was traditionally worn from Victoria Day through until Labour Day.|$|E
25|$|The smaller of the Egyptian ells {{measured}} , but {{the standard}} Babylonian ell, cast in stone {{on one of}} the statues of King Gudea, was 49.5cm (19.49in), and the larger Egyptian ell was between 52.5 and 52.8cm (20.67 and 20.79in). The Books of Samuel portray the Temple as having a Phoenician architect, and in Phoenicia it was the Babylonian ell which was used to measure the size of parts of ships. Thus scholars are uncertain whether the standard Biblical ell would have been 49.5 or 52.5cm (19.49 or 20.67in), but are <b>fairly</b> <b>certain</b> {{that it was one of}} these two figures. From these figures for the size of a Biblical ell, that of the basic unit — the finger-breadth (Etzba) — can be calculated to be either 2.1 or 2.2cm (0.83 or 0.87in); Rav Chayim No'eh approximates at 2cm (0.79in); Talmudic scholar Chazon Ish at 2.38cm (0.94in). The mile (Mil) is thus about 963 or 1146 meters (3160 or 3760ft) — approximately six or seven tenths of a mile, and significantly shorter than the modern statute or land mile of 5280ft or 1760 yd (approximately 1.6km).|$|E

500|$|As the cyclone moved northwestward {{along the}} {{southern}} periphery of the Azores High, it began a period of rapid deepening in which a [...] "pinhole" [...] eye became distinguishable on satellite imagery; on this basis, Danielle was upgraded to a hurricane at 1200UTC on August25. At the time, Danielle was a compact system, with tropical storm force winds spanning only [...] from the center. Although the NHC was <b>fairly</b> <b>certain</b> that the storm would continue west-northwestward, a veer north or south of the forecast track seemed plausible due {{to the influence of}} an upper-level low to the west-northwest of Danielle. Nonetheless, the storm continued its west-northwest track. At 0600UTC on August26, Danielle attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 105mph (165km/h), one of four peak intensities. Although the eye became obscured and southeasterly vertical wind shear increased late on August26, the National Hurricane Center did not indicate weakening and instead predicted that Danielle would reach winds of 120mph (195km/h) by late on August27. Early on August27, a United States Air Force reconnaissance aircraft flight reported surface winds of 80mph (130km/h), though post-analysis indicates that the intensity of the storm was underestimated.|$|E
500|$|On July 3, 2013, the Rockets omitted White's {{name from}} its Orlando Summer League roster, which was {{conspicuous}} according to Houston Chronicle writer Jonathan Feigen. Two days later, several news outlets confirmed that White {{and the rights}} to Furkan Aldemir had been traded to the Philadelphia 76ers for future considerations, which helped Houston clear $1.7 million of salary cap space to help sign Dwight Howard. As White waited for the trade to be approved, he played in a YMCA league. On July 13, the 76ers announced the deal officially. White participated in voluntary offseason workouts with the team and was expected to participate in training camp when it began on September 28. On September 27, at media day, White stated {{that he planned to}} travel with the team when necessary (even on its pre-season trip to Spain). However, White did not make the October 4 trip with the team to Spain. The press reported that 14 players traveled with the team and 5 did not. CBS Sports journalist Matt Moore gave three possible reasons for White's absence: 1.) goodwill effort by the team, 2.) a sign the team plans to waive him, 3.) a conditioning issue. Philadelphia Daily News reporter Bob Cooney tweeted, [...] "White, who suffers from anxiety disorder, planned to make the flight but team 'gave him a pass,' source told me." [...] According to 76ers coach Brett Brown, [...] "It really was just based on our team doctor giving me and [...] Sam [...] and the club advice that it may be best for him to remain at home." [...] The box score from {{the first game of the}} road trip indicates that 15 players traveled with the team and 5 did not. On October 25, 2013, White was waived by the 76ers as they cut their roster from 20 to 16 before the October 28 deadline to reach a 15-man roster. The move was described as surprising to various NBA analysts such as NJ.com's Eliot Shorr-Parks and Bleacher Report Joe Flynn. On October 24, USA Today had run an article suggesting that White was <b>fairly</b> <b>certain</b> to make the team. By mid-December, White was living in Chadds Ford Township, Pennsylvania with his wife and children aged 2.5 years and 6 months and had switched agents from Andrew Vye of ASM Sports to George Bass of AAI Sports.|$|E
