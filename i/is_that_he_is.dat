5|$|Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak of the University of Maryland {{discusses}} how {{one aspect}} of Kiarostami's cinematic style <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> able to capture essences of Persian poetry and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films. In Where Is the Friend's Home? and The Wind Will Carry Us, classical Persian poetry is directly quoted in the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them. This in turn reflects on {{the connection between the}} past and present, between continuity and change.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} in Troilus' characterisation from the Filostrato <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> no longer misogynistic in the beginning. Instead of mocking lovers {{because of their}} putting trust in women, he mocks them because of how love affects them. Troilus' vision of love is stark: total commitment offers total fulfilment; any form of failure means total rejection. He is unable to comprehend the subtleties and complexities that underlie Criseyde's vacillations and Pandarus' manoeuvrings.|$|E
5|$|The Joker has {{undergone}} many revisions since his 1940 debut. The most common {{interpretation of the}} character <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> disguised as the criminal Red Hood, and pursued by Batman. The Joker falls into a vat of chemicals which bleaches his skin, colors his hair green and his lips red, and drives him insane. The reasons why the Joker was disguised as the Red Hood, and his identity before his transformation have changed over time.|$|E

It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> some idle fellow, who prefers killing snakes to honest work; {{but it may}} also <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the escaped {{prisoner}} of whom we are in search." ...|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, I have herein {{told you}} with great particularity all these {{circumstances}} of his early history so that you may know exactly how it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> taken away into the lake, and why it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> afterward known as Sir Launcelot, surnamed of the Lake.|$|R
50|$|Three main {{theories}} exist {{about what}} happened: One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> got lost and perished somehow, likely {{during the first}} night. Another <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> attacked by a hungry bear and carried off. The last <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> abducted and {{taken out of the}} park by a human. His father is a proponent of the third theory.|$|R
25|$|Lien Chan {{has been}} {{sometimes}} denoted a waishengren, often by his political opponents, although the general perception on Taiwan <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not. Although {{he was born}} in mainland China and his mother was of mainland ancestry, his father's ancestral home was in Tainan, Taiwan.|$|E
25|$|Cauchy {{makes some}} general remarks about {{functions}} in Chapter I, Section 1 of his Analyse algébrique (1821). From {{what he says}} there, {{it is clear that}} he normally regards a function as being defined by an analytic expression (if it is explicit) or by an equation or a system of equations (if it is implicit); where he differs from his predecessors <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> prepared to consider the possibility that a function may be defined only for a restricted range of the independent variable.|$|E
25|$|The gospel's title {{appears at}} the end of the Coptic {{manuscript}} in a colophon; the only connection with Philip the Apostle within the text <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the only apostle mentioned (at 73,8). The text proper makes no claim to be from Philip, though, similarly, the four New Testament gospels make no explicit claim of authorship. The Gospel of Philip was written between 150 AD and 350 AD, while Philip himself lived in the first century, making it extremely unlikely to be his writing. Most scholars hold a 3rd-century date of composition.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} Stephen Northup are unknown. Published sources are silent {{as to his}} provenance, but online sources have offered two possibilities. One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born in 1633 {{as the son of}} Hampton Northup of Flintshire, Wales. The other <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born in 1625, the son of Henry Northup of Whaddon, Cambridgeshire, England.|$|R
50|$|Contemporary opinion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> an Irish abbot, {{who died}} c. 575.|$|R
50|$|What is {{less well}} known <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> also a {{prolific}} poet.|$|R
25|$|The {{only other}} source to perhaps allude {{to the battle}} is the Skáldskaparmál, where Snorri Sturluson {{mentions}} a coat of mail called Finnsleif (English: Finn's legacy). The names {{of some of the}} characters in the Battle of Finnsburg are mentioned in other sources, usually in genealogies such as the reference to Folcwald and Finn in the Historia Brittonum. Hengest is mentioned in several works, but his identity and exploits are unclear. One argument, still supported by some recent scholars, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the same figure as the Anglo-Saxon founder of the Kingdom of Kent.|$|E
25|$|Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak, of the University of Maryland, {{argues that}} {{one aspect of}} Kiarostami's {{cinematic}} style <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> able to {{capture the essence of}} Persian poetry and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films. In several of his movies such as Where is the Friend's Home and The Wind Will Carry Us, classical Persian poetry is directly quoted in the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them. This in turn reflects on the connection between the past and present, between continuity and change.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{eminence}} and influence, one criticism {{leveled against}} Yashovijaya <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{best known for}} his Navya-Nyaya commentaries of earlier existing works rather than his own original works. Furthermore, his works on Yoga, dhyana, grammar and poetry did not gain much fame, as the works of Haribhadra and Hemacandra on these topics were already established and famous by the time Yashovijaya came on the scene. His fame largely rests on his mastery of navyanyaya, for which he had no contemporary rival. This could be because, for almost six centuries between Hemacandra and Yashovijaya, Jainism did not produce any able scholar on philosophy of nyaya.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, Geoffrey Robertson QC alleged <b>that</b> Phillip's remains <b>are</b> {{no longer}} in St Nicholas Church, Bathampton and have been lost: [...] "...Captain Arthur Phillip is not where the ledger stone says <b>he</b> is: it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> buried somewhere outside, it may simply <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> simply lost. But <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not where Australians have <b>been</b> led to believe <b>that</b> <b>he</b> now lies." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{trouble with}} our genial humorist <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> beyond his depth. He {{would not make}} a success if he turned statesman. He would not {{make much of a}} success if he turned missionary; as a humorist he is incomparable. Every man to his trade. Let Mark {{remember}} this, and let him choose as a target for his satire something other than the heroic men who have been through the nightmare of blood and ruin in China, while he has been comfortably basking in the sunlight that makes eternal summer for a genius admired of both old world and new.|$|E
25|$|An episcopal rank {{given for}} a Hierarch {{of a small}} town or village, under the {{jurisdiction}} of a Metropolitan Bishop, a Metropolitan Archbishop or a Bishop. He has the same ecclesiastical authority as that of the other Hierarchs. The exception <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> to ordain Priests or Deacons and all Minor Orders, to consecrate holy vessels, altars, baptisteries or Churches only in his village or town and only with the authorization of the Patriarch, if assigned within the Patriarchal Diocese, or that of a Metropolitan Bishop, a Metropolitan Archbishop or a Bishop of the Metropolis/Diocese, in which his town or village is.|$|E
25|$|Jeremiah is {{an aging}} {{member of the}} TNT. He is an Italian immigrant, and a running gag of the series <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> an extreme hypochondriac who suffers from many {{diseases}} or medical syndromes (and sometimes, he even suffers from diseases he invented). He is bald and nearly toothless, and he usually sleeps around in the flower shop with The Boss. He is usually on guard duty and never on active missions due to his age, but sometimes proves crucial to missions. Another running gag {{is his ability to}} sleep through most extreme situations without waking up. He is a former street vendor and a hermit, which caused his bad health.|$|E

25|$|Satan {{is deeply}} arrogant, albeit {{powerful}} and charismatic. Satan's persuasive powers are evident throughout the book; {{not only is}} he cunning and deceptive, but he is also able to rally the fallen angels to continue in the rebellion after their agonizing defeat in the Angelic War. He argues that God rules as a tyrant and that all the angels ought to rule as gods. Though commonly understood to be the antagonizing force in Paradise Lost, Satan may be best defined as a tragic or Hellenic hero. According to William McCollom, one quality of the classical tragic hero <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not perfectly good and that his defeat is caused by a tragic flaw, as Satan causes both the downfall of man and the eternal damnation of his fellow fallen angels despite his dedication to his comrades. In addition, Satan's Hellenic qualities, such as his immense courage and, perhaps, lack of completely defined morals compound his tragic nature.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} two interpretations of Chen's actions during the {{election}} in terms of independence politics. The first <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> ideologically committed to advancing Taiwan independence and that his actions are intended to systematically remove the constraints which prevent this from occurring. Seen in this light, his actions are intended to provoke a crisis in which the PRC must either start a war or accept independence, {{with the expectation that}} the PRC would back down. Ironically, this interpretation of his actions is shared both among his most fervent supporters (who think it is a good thing) and his most bitter opponents (who think that it is a bad thing). It is largely to counter this possibility that the PRC has issued statements that it will definitely go to war if certain red lines are crossed. However, they in reality carry little meaning, as Beijing has made such statements warning against electing former President Lee and Chen in the 1996 and 2000 elections, which both failed to materialize. Some people regard these statements now as reverse psychology, as Lee and Chen may help to weaken ROC and advance the unification process.|$|E
25|$|The {{win over}} the title-contending Cobb gave Norton another shot at a {{potential}} title-fight, and on May 11, 1981. at Madison Square Garden {{he stepped into the}} ring with top contender Gerry Cooney, who, like Cobb, was undefeated entering the fight. Very early in the fight it became clear that Norton was no longer the caliber of fighter he once was, as Cooney's first punch caused Norton's legs to buckle. Norton continued to take shots from Cooney in his corner for nearly a full minute before Perez, who refereed his last fight, stepped in to stop the bout 54 seconds in, as Norton was slumped in his corner. Norton decided to retire following the match and turned his attention to charitable pursuits. Norton's enduring legacy as a fighter <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> considered second to Joe Frazier as Ali's main nemesis and toughest opponent. Norton fought Ali to three decisions and was never hurt or knocked down. All three bouts were close and subject to controversy. Unfortunately, Norton was less successful against three of the greatest punchers of all time, losing by KO to Foreman and Shavers and by TKO to Cooney. Norton was considered past his prime in boxing from 1979 to 1981.|$|E

25|$|Charlie's {{research}} often {{interferes with}} his relationships: as with Amita {{on their first}} date, for all they could talk about is mathematics; Fleinhardt {{says that it is}} a common interest and they should not struggle to avoid the subject. Charlie and Amita had several false starts. Charlie has also spent some time with his ex-girlfriend, Susan Berry (Sonya Walger), an attractive neuroscientist from London. He had lived with Susan for two years, and Larry described this as his very own Berry's phase. However, she later reveals that she is currently involved with someone else and has to return to England. Charlie attempts to start a relationship with Amita once more, though her job offer at Harvard University strains this possibility and makes him distraught for some time. Eventually, she decides to take the alternative offer at CalSci with the hope to begin a romantic relationship with him, though his fear of possible failure causes him to question whether he wants this second chance; Don cautions him about such an attitude. Amita notices his ambivalence and isn't certain if she wants to back out of the relationship, but he then pushes it forward. Pressures from their colleagues over the inappropriateness of the relationship nearly cost them, but {{by the middle of the}} third season their romantic involvement stabilizes and they have grown considerably closer. He feels rejected when Amita does not want him to meet her father, due to his expectations about the men she dates. Initially, he wonders if it is based on him being Jewish, but the problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not Indian-born. Alan explains that Mr. Ramanujan would like him after meeting him. Charlie and Amita state that they love each other, and have even decided to move in together, though, the actual living arrangement has not been determined. When Amita's parents finally meet him, they are rude, but warm to him later. Alan says that Charlie will have to marry her.|$|E
500|$|The Apostolic Faith {{publication}} {{reported the}} happenings at the Azusa Street Mission to the world. Its first issue's lead story was titled [...] "Pentecost has Come". It contained {{a letter from}} Charles Parham, an article on Pentecost from Acts, {{and a series of}} anecdotes of people's experience within the revival. One edition in 1907 wrote, [...] "One token of the Lord's coming <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> melting all races and nations together, and they are filled with the power and glory of God. He is baptizing by one spirit into one body and making up a people that will be ready to meet Him when He comes". The Apostolic Faith brought increasing attention to the happenings at Azusa Street and the fledgling movement that was emerging from the revival.|$|E
500|$|The golden ticket promotional gimmick, {{from which}} the episode {{receives}} its title, is {{a reference to the}} golden tickets from the 1964 Roald Dahl novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, as well as the 1971 and 2005 film adaptations of the book. Throughout {{the first half of the}} episode, Michael wears a purple suit and top hat similar to Willy Wonka, the character responsible for the promotion from which this episode takes its name. Blue Cross of Pennsylvania, the Dunder Mifflin client who receives the Golden Tickets, is a real-life division of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, an American health insurance company. After throwing away the Willy Wonka outfit, Michael wears a gray T-shirt advertising the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Pioneers, a minor league arena football team. One of the excuses Michael uses to avoid David's phone calls <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> attending an [...] "Obama fashion show", a reference to U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama.|$|E
