40|$|Housing {{is not one}} of the European Union (EU’s) formal competences, but European {{integration}} does affect member states’ {{housing policies}} to a significant extent. Without the establishment of EU-level competence, housing cannot become a field of positive integration and the Europeanisation of housing policies will continue to occur through negative integration, i. e. removing housing policy barriers to the establishment of the single European market. This paper analyses a state aid case relating to housing development in the city of Apeldoorn, the Netherlands. The case would suggest that the Commission concludes, on the one hand, that policies which use state funds to provide land for housing distort competition and yet, on the other hand, it views the improvement of the urban environment and quality of life in the neighbourhood as a well-defined EU objective that may make such aid permissible. This case is examined in the context of other state aid decisions on the Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas programme and on services of <b>general</b> <b>economic</b> <b>interests,</b> as well as a comparable case in which state aid was not allowed. It concludes that an EU competence has developed on the urban environment and quality of life and that, as such, positive integration on housing issues exists.

40|$|Die vorliegende Arbeit befasst sich mit der Implementierung von EU Richtlinien am Beispiel der Richtlinie 2008 / 6 /EG zur vollständigen Öffnung des europäischen Postmarktes. Auf Grundlage der {{multilevel}} Governance Theorie wurde eine AkteurInnenanalyse im {{policy cycle}} durchgeführt. Diese Arbeit gliedert sich in zwei Teile. Im ersten Teil wurde der Einfluss der verschiedenen AkteurInnen und die Auswirkungen auf die tatsächliche Politikimplementierung also das gesetzliche Endprodukt analysiert. Hier wurden sowohl die EU-Richtlinien selbst als auch vier ausgewählte nationale Postgesetze herangezogen. Mit der Kuhn’schen Theorie zum Paradigmenwechsel und der Hegel’schen Synthesentheorie konnte festgestellt werden, dass der von der Europäischen Kommission geforderte Wechsel hin zur Dienstleistung von allgemeinem wirtschaftlichem Interesse nicht vollzogen wurde. Im zweiten Teil der Arbeit wurden die involvierten AkteurInnen einzeln analysiert und in ihren Verflechtungen betrachtet. Dabei wurde speziell auf deren Positionen, Einfluss und Netzwerke in den verschiedenen Phasen des policy cycle sowie auf die verschiedenen Ebenen eingegangen. Bei der AkteurInnenanalyse konnte festgestellt werden, dass neben den institutionalisierten AkteurInnen im Rahmen des Gesetzgebungsprozesses nur drei HauptakteurInnen, nämlich ArbeitgeberInnen, Gewerkschaften und regionale InteressensvertreterInnen in dem untersuchten Beispiel eine Rolle spielen. Von multilevel Governance nach Arthur Benz kann man nur in einigen Phasen des policy cyclus sprechen. Zuletzt konnte noch festgestellt werden, dass die Politikimplementierung negative Effekte für die Bevölkerung der betroffenen Mitgliedsstaaten mit sich brachte und sozialen Druck auf die ArbeitnehmerInnen in den Unternehmen erzeugte, was wiederum auf die suprantaionale Ebene zurück wirkte. This paper analyses {{the implementation of}} European Directives using the example of Directive 2008 / 6 /EC on the full opening of the European postal market. An analysis of stakeholders within the policy cycle has been done using multilevel governance theory. The first section of the paper analyses the influence of different stakeholders and their effective impact on policy implementation, thus the legislation as the legal final product. The European Directives and four selected postal laws {{have been used for}} the research. Kuhn’s theory on the change of paradigms and Hegel’s theory of synthesis provide the basis for the argument that the change demanded by the European Commission towards services of <b>general</b> <b>economic</b> <b>interests</b> didn’t take place. In {{the second part of the}} paper, the involved stakeholders and their networks have been analyzed separately. In doing so, the paper focuses particularly on their positions, influences and networks in the different phases of the policy cycle and their multiple levels of influence. Besides the institutional representatives within the legal processes, only three main actors, employers, trade unions and regional stakeholders played a substantial role in this case. Furthermore, these stakeholders only had impact on several phases of the policy cycle, as described by Arthur Benz through the term multilevel governance. In conclusion, the analysis revealed an emerging tension amongst citizens and employees produced by the implementation of the Directive in the countries and companies, which was policy derived from the supranational level. The formulated scientific problem and the hypothesis have been responded to as best as possible with the theoretical and methodological approach used and the literature reviewed...|$|R
