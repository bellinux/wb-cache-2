The land {{question}} and the consumption of rural space * The first day was devoted to a report on University research projects, the second to {{a study of the}} policies and practices of local authorities and of the agencies concerned with the control and management of the different categories of land, especially agricultural and forest. Following the introduction by Mr Meyer-Heine explaining the aims of the conference, Mr Guichard and Mr Séguret 1 (GRESAP, University of Nice) described their interest in the land question as related to the consumption of rural space in the Alpes-Maritimes context. Mrs Hélène Bellon then described the research work carried out in the town planning laboratory of the IAR, which studied the situation in the Var, the Bouches-du-Rhône and the surrounding backcountry. Despite their different starting points, these studies displayed distinct similarities in their analysis of the process by which rural spaces are subjected to urbanization in the broadest sense. The team at the Town Planning laboratory of the IAR had initial objectives of an operational nature : To what extent do the instruments of physical planning exert an impact, concretely ? Can the natural spaces in the Provence-Côte-d'Azur area be effectively protected ? Guichard and Séguret, on the other hand, started out with a more economic approach. The two teams were quite close in their observations concerning the process of land investment and the respective strategies of the various agents or actors involved. The same mechanisms appeared throughout the entire region from the sea to the Alps and at all the periods that witnessed the urbanization of the Mediterranean Midi. Haumont and Cunéo (Planning and Development, Paris) described the research work carried out in 1978 and 1979 concerning property in, and use of, land, and the related images and practices, on the basis of two study areas : One was in the Forcalquier Basin, in the Alps of the Haute-Provence (where the Aix-en-Provence team also operated), while the other was in the Sarthe valley. This team's objectives went beyond legal and economic considerations and emphasized the representations of property in social relations as an achievement of the family in its search for identity and continuity. These researches confirm those of Mr Guigou (the subject of a report in Paris) who {{in the course of the}} discussion stressed the desire of city people to sink roots by having a second country home, which they prefer emotionally to their urban residence, regarded as a mere practical necessity for their work. Mr Vincent Renard (the Economics Labo- ratory of the Ecole Polytechnique) brought into the discussion the <b>fiscal</b> <b>factor</b> as an instrument for the regulation of the real estate market, and the use that could be made of it to improve the functioning of the zoning measures established by the town planning projects, following the frequent example of Anglo-Saxon countries. Mr Kayser, Professor at the Institute of Geography of Toulouse-Le Mirail, has described the research carried out in the Toulouse and Montpellier peripheries concerning both the process of urbanization of rural space and the personal and family behavior and practices of the farmers. There is an analysis of the various categories of sellers : active cultivators attached to their plots, poor owners ofting plots, heirs of the third generation. Unlike the provençal market, always very active in the face of a strong demand, the relatively resistant Languedoc market seems to have been stabilized for the past few years. Mr Neveux, Director of the Regional Center of Forest Property of the Provence-Côte-d'Azur, described the state of private forest property in that region : of a million hectares of forest, two-thirds are private (100 000 hectares belong to the State, while 200 000 belong to the municipalities). He deplored the fact that, with a view to protecting the forests, there was too much emphasis on construction in flat country at the expense of productive agricultural spaces, and on the southern slopes of hillsides where forests have great difficulty in developing and where they burn most easily. Under the direction of Mr Granai, a discussion was engaged concerning the validity of generalizing the behavior of certain social actors by assigning them to formal categories, and concerning the definitions of the various categories of space : the limits of suburban space, spaces classified as forest by the relevant services, etc. From one region to another, the vision of the observers changes : If, between Languedoc and Provence, we observe definite differences, the differences are even greater in the case of the Sarthe or Alsace, which is also subjected to very strong residential pressure coming from the other side of the Rhine. From the first day of the conference, the operational dimension of the construction market, the question of regulatory instruments, made its appearance in the discussions. The point was made that the demand for real estate on the part of foreigners has been the consequence not only of greater facilities for building permits but also of lower real estate prices in France. Mr Lhuillier having explained that the turning point for the market is the transition from the agricultural to the urban, it became clear that the basic problem was one of establishing a double agricultural and urban market through the simple play of classical economic forces. In the Provence-Alps-Côte-d'Azur region, the consumption of space nevertheless assumes a very special significance. Mr Pierre Martel, founder and leader of the movement «Alpes de Lumière», reported cases of speculation : Real estate in the Haute-Provence has been acquired by foreign operators who never saw it and perhaps never will. The speculation craze coming from the Côte d'Azur is really destructive of the local society. Mr Benard — a former Minister and currently Mayor of Vars and Chairman of the Planning Commission of the Etablissement Public Régional (EPR, Regional Public Establishment) for Provence-Côte d'Azur — concluded the first day's work by questioning the ability of this institution, in its present state, to master the regional future. The DATAR (a regional planning agency based in Paris) had hardly ever acted except by granting subsidies from its offices in the capital, although far better results could be achieved by letting people act on their own and carry out the necessary adjustment in full awareness of the basic problems. The scattering of activities among the municipalities cannot succeed, and measures imposed by the upper echelons of the state apparatus are deeply resen- ted. A genuine land policy, the basis of all regional planning action, can result only from the pooling of wills and efforts within spaces that are limited but sufficiently extensive for effective operation. Opening the second day's session, Mr Granai stressed the fact that on-the-spot research has provided us with instruments of prediction concerning the land investment process, and this should make it possible, if the political will exists, to invent instruments enabling us to take appropriate action in time. Mr Didier 5, Senator and Chairman of the Land Committee of the EPR, presided during the second day's session. He showed that the fluctuating demand of the investors, who had earlier invaded the Côte d'Azur, is now gravitating inland, toward land with agricultural potential. Now, the region is keenly interested in maintaining, at all costs, its mountain agriculture, absolutely indispensable for conserving the soil and protecting it from the devastating erosion that tends to destroy the economic, psychological and social balance of the entire region. The ERP having assumed this conservationist mission, the land committee hopes to implement its land acquisition policies (aside from construction) by depending on the local communities, essentially the municipalities and the consensus of the local authorities. The mayors must agree not to re-sell the land, even after the eventual completion of various urbanization projects. Until now, the ERP has judged it premature, in view of its own inadequate financial means, to set up a regional real estate agency to carry out its acquisition policy. Mr Didier believes that when the time comes, it will be the responsibility of the E RP to act without any intermediary. In a well-documented report 6, Mr Rojat 1 provides some facts about the action of the SAFER (a regional agency for Rural Replotting) and the limits imposed on it at the national level. As the instrument of a professional policy, it can effectuate only micro-adjustments. In a dozen years, it was able to create 490 new farms and improve some 5 000 others. Each year, 50 000 hectares are bought, 45 000 retroceded. The effectiveness of its activity would seem to depend largely on the establishment of a preliminary land use plan (Plan d'occupation des sols — POS), creating a common will. Such action is effective in the periurban areas, while in the depressed zones of the Southern Alps, the market is very difficult to penetrate. Sellers are hard to find offering prices compatible with eventual resale to the benefit of farmers, especially the young ones that can and should be enabled by priority to settle in the area. An exchange took place between Mr Didier, representing the ERP, and Mr Rojat for the SAFER, concerning the respective policies of these two agencies which, it would seem, have not always been perfectly coordinated. Promises were made on both sides to improve contacts between the two agencies and harmonize their activities in the future. In the final report of the conference, Mr de Montgolfier 8 dealt with the legal status of the State forests. He stressed the very slow specific rhythm of exploitation that prevails there and the specific features of the Mediterranean forest. Its lack of direct and inherent profitableness is compensated by its present function as a leisure spot for the city people and its permanent functions of protection for the regional space. The new uses of the biomass must, moreover, be taken into consideration from now on. The rhythm of forest administration can be examined only in terms of a patrimony, which brings us back to the ideas expressed in the various reports of the pre- vious day. The problem of the conservation of land units is forcefully raised. The regional parks, particularly the Luberon park, are directly and consciously concerned by this problem. It fell to the director of the IAR, Mr Prats, to conclude the work of the second day. He expressed satisfaction with the way the theoretical and practical work of the two days' sessions linked up harmoniously. In his view, the conference focused attention on the following four problems : 1. the opacity of real estate laws and rules, a legacy of the abusus in Roman law, coupled with the problem of what constitutes price honesty in commercial transactions; 2. the extreme diversity of the lands, the localizations, the operators, necessitating the adaptation of methods and strategies to the specific case. Hence the importance of practical experience; 3. the choice of the most effective type of action : which operator should be used ? How can all concerned best adapt to the nature of the problem ? 4. the criteria applied in the allocation of funds — criteria that basically depend on political judgements. «The time required for understanding is infinitely longer than the time required for action. » It is therefore necessary to improve our knowledge long in advance, since theories handed down from the distant past prove in many cases to be very much out of tune with the urgent needs of the real estate actors. El problema de la propiedad raíz y el consumo de espacio rural* La primera jordana estuvo consagrada a la exposición de investigaciones universitarias. La segunda, al estudio de las prácticas y las políticas de las colectividades públicas y de los organismos encargados del control y de la administración de las diversas categorías de la propiedad raíz, agrícola y forestal, sobre todo. Después de una introducción del Sr. Meyer-Heine, en la que expuso los objetivos del coloquio, los Sres. Guichard y Séguret 1 (GRESAP, Universidad de Niza) mostraron como llegaron a infere sarse particularmente por el problema planteado por la propiedad del suelo, en sus relaciones con el consumo del espacio rural, en el departamento de los Alpes-Marítimos. La Sra. Helene Bellon describió, a continuación, las investigaciones del Laboratorio de urbanismo del IAR, que estudió las situaciones en los departamentos del Var, de las Bocas del Ródano y en las zonas más alejadas de la costa. Apareció una similitud entre estos trabajos, en razón del análisis de los procesos de ataque de los espacios rurales por parte de la urbanización, en un sentido muy amplio, y con puntos de partida diferentes. El equipo del Laboratorio de urbanismo del IAR 2 tenía inicialmente objetivos operativos : en qué medida tienen impacto concreto los instrumentos de planificación física ? Es posible proteger eficazmente los espacios naturales de la región de Provenza-Costa Azul ? Los señores Guichard y Séguret, al principo, tenían preocupaciones más económicas. Ambos equipos se encontraron en la constatación de los procesos de inversión en la propiedad raíz, y de las estrategias de los diferentes actores intervinientes. Sobre el conjunto del territorio regional, del mar a los Alpes, y en todos los tiempos que marcaron la urbanización del Mediodía mediterráneo, aparecen los mismos mecanismos. Los Sres. Haumont y Cúneo 3 (Développement et Aménagement, Paris) expusieron investigaciones realizadas en 1978 y 1979 sobre la propiedad y el uso del suelo, sus representaciones y sus prácticas, partiendo de dos zonas de estudio : una en la cuenca de Forcalquier, en el departamento de los Alpes de Alta Provenza (donde el equipo de Aix-en-Provence también habia trabajado) y la otra en el valle del Sarthe. El objetivo de este equipo, más allá de las dimensiones económicas y jurídicas, se ocupaba sobre todo de las representaciones de la propiedad en las relaciones sociales, como señal de prestigio familiar, en la búsqueda de identidad y de continuidad. Estas investigaciones convergen con las del Sr. Guigou (ya expuestas en París), que intervino en el curso de los debates para subrayar, sobre todo, el deseo de enraizarse, de los habitantes de las ciudades, por medio de la residencia secundaria en el campo. Esta es preferida, con respecto a la habita¬ ción urbana, que se siente ligada únicamente con la profesión. El Sr. Vincent Renard (Laboratorio de Econometría de la Escuela Politécnica, París) introdujo en la discusión el factor fiscal, como instrumento de regulación del mercado de los bienes raíces, y el uso que podría dársele para mejorar el funcionamiento de los zoneamientos establecidos por los planes de urbanismo, siguiendo los ejemplos fre- cuentes, principalmente en los países anglosajones. El Sr. Kayser 4, profesor del Instituto de Geografía de Toulouse-Le Mir ail, expuso sus investigaciones en las periferias de Tolosa y de Montpellier, que tratan a la vez sobre el proceso de urbanización del espacio rural, y sobre los comportamientos y las prácticas personales y familiares de los agricultores. Fueron analizadas las distintas categorías de vendedores : explotadores activos ligados a sus explotaciones, propietarios pobres de pequeñas parcelas aisladas, herederos de la tercera generación. Contrariamente al mercado provenzal siempre muy activo, frente a una demanda muy fuerte, el mercado de Languedoc, relativamente resistente, parece haberse estabilizado, desde hace algunos años. El Sr. Neveux, director del Centro Regional de la propiedad forestal de la región de Provenza-Costa Azul, expuso el estado de la propiedad forestal y privada de esa región. Sobre un millón de hectáreas de bosques, dos tercios son privados (100 000 ha pertenecen al Estado, y 200 000 a las Comunas). Lamentó que, con el fin de proteger a los bosques se haya favorecido demasiado a la construcción en las planicies, en prejuicio de los espacios agrícolas productivos, y sobre las laderas orientadas al sur, en las colinas, allí donde los bosques tienen más dificultad, para desarrollarse y donde se incendian más fácilmente. Se entabló una discusión, bajo la dirección del Sr. Granai, sobre el bien fundado de las generalizaciones de comportamientos de algunos actores a categorías formales y sobre las definiciones de las diversas categorías de espacios : límites de los espacios suburbanos, de los espacios clasificados forestales por los servicios interesados, etc. De una región a la otra la visión de los observadores cambia : si existen diferencias entre el Languedoc y la Provenza, éstas son mucho más grandes entre la Sarthe y la Alsacia, sometida a una fuerte presión residencial proveniente de más alia del Rhin. Desde la primera jornada del coloquio apareció en las discusiones la dimensión operacional del mercado de la construcción, la de los instrumentos reglamentarios. Fué remarcado que el pedido de tierras proveniente del extranjero resultaba, no sólo de las más grandes facilidades para construir, sino también del precio más bajo de las tierras en Francia. Cuando el Sr. Lhuillier recordó que el punto de ruptura del mercado es el pasaje del agrícola al urbano, apareció de nuevo el problema de poder consolidar un doble mercado agrícola y urbano en el simple juego de las obligaciones económicas clási¬ cas. En la región de Provenza-Costa Azul el consumo del espacio tiene una significación particular. El Sr. Pierre Martel, animador y fundador del movimiento «Alpes luminosos» constató que la tierra de la Alta Provenza es adquirida por operadores extranjeros que no la conocen y no la conocerán nunca. El contagio especulativo proveniente de la Costa Azul es el verdadero destructor de la sociedad local. El Sr. Benard, ex-ministro, alcalde de Vars y presidente de la Comisión de Planeamiento en el Establecimiento Público Regional (EPR) Provenza-Costa Azul, concluyó los trabajos de la primera jornada, interrogándose sobre la capacidad de esta institución, en su estado actual, para dominar el futuro de la región. La DATAR no tuvo otra actuación que el envío de subvenciones desde la capital cuando lo eficaz hubiera sido permitir a los locales de actuar, procediendo a los reagrupamientos necesarios y tomando conciencia de los problemas esenciales. La pulverisación de las acciones entre las comunas no lleva a ningún fin, sobre todo las que son impuestas por las esferas superiores son mal vistas. Una política de propiedad raíz eficaz, base de toda acción de planeamiento, no puede resultar más que de las voluntades comunes en los espacios limitados, pero suficientes para ser eficaces. El Sr. Grattai abrió la segunda jordana marcando el hecho que las investigaciones en el terreno permiten disponer, actual¬ mente, de instrumentos de previsión de los procesos de investimientos en tierras en el espacio rural. Desde ese momento se puede actuar en tiempo útil en la medida que se percibe una voluntad política. El Sr. Didier 5, senador, presidente de la Comisión de la Propiedad Raíz del EPR, presidió la segunda jornada del coloquio. Mostró que el flujo de los pedidos de la inversionistas a partir de la inversión excesiva de la Costa Azul, se dirige ahora hacia el interior del país sobre las tierras con vocación mucho más agrícola. Pero la región quiere mantener, cueste lo que cueste, una agricultura de montaña, indispensable para conservar y preservar la tierra de una erosión costosa que destrozaría el equilibrio a la vez económico, paisajista y social sobre toda la región. Porque el EPR se dió esta misión de conservación, la comisión de propiedad raíz se apoya — para aplicar su política de adquisición de tierras, excluyendo las construcciones — sobre las colectividades locales, fundamentalmente sobre la comunas y sobre el consenso de los consejeros municipales. Los alcaldes se comprometen a no vender la tierra, aún después de realizar operaciones eventuales de urbanismo. Hasta el presente, el EP R estimó prematuro y no tiene los medios financieros para instalar una agencia de los bienes raíces regional capaz de llevar una política de adquisición. El Sr. Didier estima que llegado el momento el EPR actuará sin intermediarios. El Sr. Rojat 6, en un discurso documentado 7 dió algunas precisiones sobre la acción de la SAFER y sobre los limites que le son impuestos al nivel nacional. Como instrumento de una política profesional ésta no puede realizar que micro-planeamientos. En una decena de años pudo crear 490 explotaciones y mejoró alrededor de 5 000. 50 000 hectáreas son compradas y 45 000 son retrocedidas cada año. La eficacia de las intervenciones dependería mucho del establecimiento de un POS prealabe determinando una voluntad comunal. Estas intervenciones son eficaces en las zonas periurbanas; por el contrario en las zonas depresivas de los Alpes del Sur, el mercado es muy difícil de penetrar, los vendedores tienen dificultades para encontrar precios compatibles para ser revendidos a los agricultores, sobre todo los jóvenes que se desea instalar en prioridad. Una conversación se instaura entre el Sr. Didier, representando al EPR y el Sr. Rojat, por la SAFER, sobre las políticas de estos dos organismos que parecen, hasta el presente, no haber sido perfectamente coordinados. Se cambiaron promesas para mejorar en el futuro los contactos y las convergencia de las acciones. En el último discurso del coloquio el Sr. Montgolfier 8 abordó el patrimonio de los bosques públicos y remarcó el ritmo especifico, muy lento qu...|$|E

The paper focuses on the policy process of class size reduction policy of local governments from 1999 to 2004. Before the current push towards decentralization of educational administration, which has begun since 2000 local governments did not have the autonomy to adopt a class size reduction policy. However, after decentralization, class size reduction policy has become one of the educational policy areas where local govemnents can exercise increasing autonomy. // Due to this context previous studies discussed the presence of political <b>factors</b> and <b>fiscal</b> <b>factors,</b> But it did not study how the factors affect the process of class size reduction policy of local governments.

It documents how the private sector is stepping in to address gaps caused by failing public services in poorer countries and identifies a strong negative relationship between GDP per capita and the degree of PSP. It also shows that, when controlling for the resource constraint, there is a positive relationship between the degree of PSP and the general reform process. The paper adds to international experience on the importance of <b>fiscal</b> <b>factors</b> in privatisation. It highlights that short-term constraints often push authorities to make decisions on private sector involvement without a full cost-benefit analysis and without the support of a developed regulatory framework.

For this, we performed {{an evaluation of the}} level of transparency of municipalities, and using the discriminant analysis identify the socioeconomic and <b>fiscal</b> <b>factors</b> that influence the Fiscal Transparency Index of Municipalities. It was found that fiscal transparency is still incipient in public administration and we confirmed that transparency is associated with better indicators of socioeconomic and fiscal development, as proposed by Bellver and Kalfinann (2005). Indirectly, you can infer that better management of resources destined to health, education and employment and income generation are more important than the amount of money invested in these items for classifying the municipalities analyzed, indicating that no matter the amount of resources invested, but the quality of expenditure made...|$|R

IRR are computed by estimating labour market premia on cross-country comparable individual-level data. Labour market premia are then adjusted for <b>fiscal</b> <b>factors</b> and costs of education. We find that returns to an additional year of tertiary education are on average above 8 % and vary in a range from 4 to 15 % in the countries and in the period under study. IRR are relatively homogenous across genders. Overall, a slightly increasing trend is observed over time. The article discusses various policy levers for shaping individual incentives to invest in tertiary education and provides some illustrative quantification of the impact of policy changes on those incentives. ...|$|R
30|$|Only {{few studies}} (Cooray 2002; Jayasinghe and Udayaseelan 2010; Amarasekara 2005) analyze the {{behavior}} of interest rates in Sri Lanka (details are presented in “Brief literature review” section). To {{the best of my}} knowledge, the determinants of interest rates in Sri Lanka are not hitherto identified. Consequently, this paper confirms the role of monetary and <b>fiscal</b> <b>factors</b> in the variations of nominal interest rates in Sri Lanka under the deregulated regime. Specifically, using an annual time series dataset, the paper examines the role of money growth, income growth, changes in nominal exchange rate, and budget deficit in the variations in nominal interest rates for 1983 – 2015. Furthermore, based on a quarterly dataset of the post-global financial recession period, when the market-based exchange rate regime was initiated, the role of monetary factors in the variations of interest rates are also studied.|$|R
30|$|The paper finds that, {{among the}} {{selected}} determinants, both M 1 and M 2 money growth cause {{interest rates to}} rise, supporting the Fisher equation view. On the other hand, the impact of income growth is negative, {{which is consistent with}} the positive impact of money growth on interest rates. The budget deficit causes interest rates to rise, which supports the Keynesian view. However, the role of the exchange rate on interest rate variations is almost insignificant and contradictory. This insignificant impact of exchange rate on interest rates reflects the overall impact of the two different exchange rate regimes in Sri Lanka over the analyzed period. This is also supported by the statistically significant estimate of the dummy variable, indicating that the change in exchange rate regime affects the relation that interest rates have maintained with monetary and <b>fiscal</b> <b>factors.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} {{evidence}} of low levels of maintenance of public buildings, we investigate trends and determinants of public building conditions in Norwegian local governments. On average, the condition of Norwegian local public facilities have improved slightly in the period 2004 - 2016. Survey data suggest substantial fluctuations in building conditions and a negative relationship between building conditions in 2004 and 2016. A driver behind this result is high investments in local governments with poor building conditions in 2004. Further, we find no systematic relationship between the conditions in 2004 and maintenance expenditures in subsequent years. We conclude that if maintenance levels are too low, investment levels may be too high. Generally, our results hint at an unhealthy balance between maintenance spending and public spending. Finally, we find that both political and <b>fiscal</b> <b>factors</b> are important in explaining building conditions...|$|R
30|$|This {{paper has}} certain policy implications. As the {{interest}} rate is influenced by both monetary and <b>fiscal</b> <b>factors,</b> it would be effective to manage {{the interest rate}} through judicious monetary and the fiscal policy management. The significant effect of the exchange rate on interest rate during the post-global recession period (when the flexible exchange rate system was operational) suggests that, apart from the domestic factors, some external factors (typically transmitted through the exchange rate channel) could {{play a role in}} the variation of interest rates. However, further analysis is required in this direction. Another limitation of the paper is the short time span of the analysis. However, the reliability of estimations is verified with the limited degrees of freedom. Nevertheless, a study of the structural change in the dynamics of interest rates due to the monetary and fiscal determinants may provide further insights as a future research topic.|$|R
30|$|To date, {{research}} on the resource curse in the English-speaking world has gradually turned to {{an emphasis on the}} political, institutional, and <b>fiscal</b> <b>factors.</b> Nevertheless, research in China’s context lags behind since most studies are still carried out primarily from the economic perspective. For example, by utilizing cross-provincial data, some studies find that the resource curse does exist in China (Hu and Xiao 2007; Shao and Qi 2009; Xu and Wang 2006; Zhang et al. 2008). In contrast, other studies based on cross-prefectural data find that the correlation between resource abundance and economic performance is not clear (Ding et al. 2007; Fang et al. 2011). These studies all adopt an economic perspective and underestimate political and institutional factors since they merely control certain political variables such as corruption (Shao and Qi 2009), government efficiency (Fang et al. 2011), and governmental intervention (Ding et al. 2007) in their statistical models.|$|R

Covering five generations, it presents an oral account of the actively concerned social groups. Wherever possible, or necessary, this is reiterated and reinforced by the written record. The work comprises two parts, the first which outlines the historic background according to available documentation, and the second which focusses on particular aspects of tribal culture and experience. Material for this section, otherwise unrecorded, came from the narrated stories, reminiscences, and often shrewd observations of the people themselves.

As an essentially ethnographic commentary, the study does not examine the economic features or effects of tourism, except where <b>fiscal</b> <b>factors</b> are pertinent to the understanding or continuity of the Te Arawa experience of the tourist world...|$|R
40|$|This article investigates how a {{worsening}} economy affects local revenue structure, {{and whether}} the impact is moderated by the fiscal relationship within higher levels of government. The revenue potential of nontax sources—fees/charges and fines/forfeitures—is considerable for local governments under economic hardship. With the panel data from California counties {{over a period of}} 11 years (2000 - 2010), this article shows that reliance on nontax revenue largely depends on the economic and <b>fiscal</b> <b>factors</b> that vary across counties, and the effect of economy is contingent on local dependence on intergovernmental transfers. Counties are likely to raise nontax revenue when the economy worsens and their transfer-dependence increases, while the marginal effect of the economic indicators changes from negative to positive as transfer-dependence increases. This article illuminates the characteristics of the two types of nontax sources in terms of the mechanisms of incentivizing human behavior, and concludes with policy implications for researchers and practitioners...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{of high and}} persistent short-term real interest rates in Brazil has stimulated an extensive literature attempting to explain its causes. Among the various contributions on the topic, one that has received considerable attention is the article by Arida, Bacha, and Lara-Resende (2004) (henceforth, ABL), which argues that risks associated with the jurisdiction and currency inconvertibility are relevant determinants {{of the level of}} short-term real interest rates. In the present paper, we formulate a methodology based on ABL's definition of jurisdiction uncertainty, use a set of institutional variables that proxy the degree of jurisdictional uncertainty, build an index of currency inconvertibility based on capital controls and use them to test ABL's conjecture and variants of it. The results are by and large unfavorable not only to ABL's conjecture, but also to variants of their argument. The results further indicate that traditional monetary and <b>fiscal</b> <b>factors</b> are far more relevant to explain the level of short-term real interest rates than the binomial jurisdictional uncertainty/ currency inconvertibility is. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} pervasive regulation in the financial system on the economy, in general, and on private investment activity, in particular. A survey of the relevant literature concentrates {{on the issue of}} the arguments for, and against, financial deregulation. A macroeconomic growth model is analysed which focuses on the implications of an abrupt rise in the (private) debt service burden, following a removal of interest rate ceilings. Subsequently, selected models of investment are estimated on Greek annual data covering the period 1958 - 1985. The aim of the empirical work is to detect the effects of the elaborate controls imposed on the Greek banking system. (The possibility of such effects, and associated policy implications, were discussed in the preceding, theoretical, part of the thesis.) Particular effort has been expended to generate the appropriate series required for the estimations, especially those relating to the <b>fiscal</b> <b>factors</b> which influence investment behaviour. The empirical results reveal the important role of policy induced financial rationing in the determination of aggregate investment in Greece...|$|R
