5|$|For Kant a {{good will}} is a broader {{conception}} than a will which acts from <b>duty.</b> A will which acts from <b>duty</b> is distinguishable as a will which overcomes hindrances {{in order to}} keep the moral law. A dutiful will is thus a special case of a good will which becomes visible in adverse conditions. Kant argues that only acts performed with regard to <b>duty</b> have moral worth. This is not to say that acts performed merely in accordance with <b>duty</b> are worthless (these still deserve approval and encouragement), but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of <b>duty.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{his paper}} The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories, philosopher Michael Stocker {{challenges}} Kantian ethics (and all modern ethical theories) {{by arguing that}} actions from <b>duty</b> lack certain moral value. He gives the example of Smith, who visits his friend in hospital out of <b>duty,</b> rather than because of the friendship; he argues that this visit seems morally lacking because it is motivated by the wrong thing. Marcia Baron has attempted to defend Kantian ethics on this point. After presenting {{a number of reasons}} that we might find acting out of <b>duty</b> objectionable, she argues that these problems only arise when people misconstrue what their <b>duty</b> is. Acting out of <b>duty</b> is not intrinsically wrong, but immoral consequences can occur when people misunderstand what they are duty-bound to do. <b>Duty</b> need not be seen as cold and impersonal: one may have a <b>duty</b> to cultivate their character or improve their personal relationships. Baron further argues that <b>duty</b> should be construed as a secondary motive—that is, a motive that regulates and sets conditions on what may be done, rather than prompt specific actions. She argues that, seen this way, <b>duty</b> neither reveals a deficiency in one's natural inclinations to act, nor undermines the motives and feelings that are essential to friendship. For Baron, being governed by <b>duty</b> does not mean that <b>duty</b> is always the primary motivation to act; rather, it entails that considerations of <b>duty</b> are always action-guiding. A responsible moral agent should take an interest in moral questions, such as questions of character. These should guide moral agents to act from <b>duty.</b>|$|E

5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either {{result in a}} contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will. The former are classified as perfect duties, the latter as imperfect. A perfect <b>duty</b> always holds true—there is a perfect <b>duty</b> to tell the truth, so we must never lie. An imperfect <b>duty</b> allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect <b>duty</b> {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect duties are more important than imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect <b>duty</b> must be followed.|$|E

The subordinate brigades of the divisions did not activate so they could not be deployed as divisions, however their active <b>duty</b> status would allow the headquarters to focus on the national guard units under them full-time.|$|E

40|$|Are {{positive}} <b>duties</b> to {{help others}} in need mere informal <b>duties</b> of virtue or can they also be enforceable <b>duties</b> of justice? In this paper I defend the claim that some positive <b>duties</b> (which I call basic positive <b>duties)</b> can be <b>duties</b> of justice {{against one of the}} most important prin- cipled objections to it. This is the libertarian challenge, according to which only negative <b>duties</b> to avoid harming others can be <b>duties</b> of justice, whereas positive <b>duties</b> (basic or nonbasic) must be seen, at best, as informal moral requirements or recommendations. I focus on the contractarian version of the libertarian challenge as recently presented by Jan Narveson. I claim that Narveson’s contractarian construal of libertarianism is not only intuitively weak, but is also subject to decisive internal problems. I argue, in particular, that it does not pro- vide a clear rationale for distinguishing between informal <b>duties</b> of virtue and enforceable <b>duties</b> of justice, that it can neither successfully justify libertarianism’s protection of negative rights nor its denial of positive ones, and that it fails to undermine the claim that basic positive <b>duties</b> are <b>duties</b> of global justice...|$|R

5000|$|Ironically, Ross' {{prima facie}} <b>duties</b> are neither prima facie nor <b>duties.</b> They are not prima facie (which means {{something}} like [...] "appears {{to be at}} first glance") since Ross' prima facie <b>duties</b> are always and everywhere pro tanto reasons in favour of something's being a moral reason. They are not <b>duties</b> since <b>duties</b> are obligations that must be performed under any circumstances. <b>Duties</b> and obligations, strictly speaking, are never outweighed, but Ross' prima facie <b>duties</b> are often outweighed by other factors.

50|$|The Doctrine of Virtue {{develops}} further Kant's ethical theory, which Kant first {{laid out}} in the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785). Kant particularly emphasizes treating humanity as an end in itself; in fact Kant's retake of the second formulation of the categorical imperative (e.g. Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals) makes possible to deduce <b>duties.</b> The <b>duties</b> are analytically treated by Kant, who distinguishes: 1) <b>duties</b> towards ourselves; 2) <b>duties</b> towards others. The <b>duties</b> are: 1) perfect duties; 2) imperfect <b>duties.</b> Kant thinks imperfect <b>duties</b> let a latitudo: i.e., the possibility of choose maxims. The perfect <b>duties</b> instead do not let any latitudo and determine exactly the maxims of actions.|$|R

5|$|Kant's {{conception}} of <b>duty</b> does not entail that people perform their duties grudgingly.

Thus, when an agent performs an action from <b>duty</b> {{it is because the}} rational incentives matter to them more than their opposing inclinations. Kant wished to move beyond the conception morality as externally imposed duties and present an ethics of autonomy, when rational agents freely recognise the claims reason makes upon them.|$|E
