5|$|An inquest into Lynott's {{death was}} held at Birmingham Coroner's Court in January 2003. The hearing was told that marks found {{on her back and}} an arm may have been bruising, but the {{pathologist}} who conducted the original post mortem could not be sure how she had died, because <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> lain undiscovered for up to seven days. It was also said that, despite her connection with Smith, police and four pathologists had failed to establish that Lynott had been murdered. The inquest jury returned an open verdict.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, Tomás Eloy Martínez {{published}} Santa Evita, a fictionalized work propounding {{many new}} {{stories about the}} escapades of the corpse. Allegations that her body was the object of inappropriate attentions are derived from his description of an 'emotional necrophilia' by embalmers, Coronel Koenig and his assistant Arancibia. Many primary and secondary references to his novel have inaccurately stated that <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> been defiled in some way resulting in the widespread belief in this myth. Also included are allegations that many wax copies had been made, that the corpse had been damaged with a hammer, {{and that one of}} the wax copies was the object of an officer's sexual attentions.|$|E
5|$|The {{stains on}} Van der Sloot's clothes matched Flores' blood type. Blood {{was also found}} on the floor, hallway, and {{mattress}} in the hotel room. Police stated that DNA tests would be conducted on the clothes, skin found under the victim's fingernails, and the previously recovered tennis racquet. Ricardo Flores stated in interviews that his daughter's body needed to be exhumed to gather the fingernail DNA evidence, and that <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> not been cremated for this reason.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid {{was present}} at the {{exhumation}} of the body of Queen Æthelthryth at Ely Abbey in 695. He had been her spiritual adviser in the 670s, and had helped the queen become a nun against the wishes of her husband King Ecgfrith of Northumbria. The queen had joined Ely Abbey, where she died in 679. The ceremony in 695 found that <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> not decayed, which led to her being declared a saint. Wilfrid's testimony as to the character and virginity of Æthelthryth was recorded by Bede.|$|E

5|$|Carbon dating {{carried out}} at the University of Edinburgh dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while {{the fact that it}} had been {{deposited}} on top of a layer of Victorian tiles suggested that it belonged to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account of throwing Thomas down the stairs, and it was found to have low collagen levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA testing was not possible as she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest of <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> been buried.|$|E
5|$|A second {{victim is}} found, {{this time a}} man whose eyes have been removed by forced surgery. Again, they {{discover}} the eyes were obtained from organ donation, and they find a connection to a woman called Amanda (Anja Savcic), a ballerina who had committed suicide. They also note the care that the culprit performed the work, and speculate that the person {{they are looking for}} is showing some compassion for his victims, calling for emergency help and using the serum to hope that they are given the proper care in time. They find that Amanda's alleged cremated remains are bogus, and that <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> been stolen before it could be cremated. They start to trace connections to Amanda, finding she was in a depression counseling support group. Though there are several possible suspects, Olivia's intuition leads her to a man named Roland David Barrett (Mark Ivanir), who was noted to have become enamored with Amanda at the meetings. At Roland's home, he has recovered the corpse and surgically replaced the organs in her body. Using a makeshift set of ropes and pulleys, Roland engages Amanda's body in a marionette act to make her perform like a ballerina, promising her he will bring her back to life.|$|E

25|$|No {{forensic}} evidence linked Fred {{to the murder}} of Anne McFall, and he always denied killing her. However, the fact <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> been extensively dismembered, and was missing several phalange bones, plus the fact the cubicle dimensions of the grave in which her body was buried match the modus operandi of Fred's later murders.|$|E
25|$|Seattle native Tammy Vincent, who {{disappeared}} in 1979, was later {{thought to be}} a possible victim of Ridgway. In 1979, <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> been found stabbed and shot to death in Tiburon, California. Her remains were not identified until 2007.

25|$|Although the Roane County {{victim was}} found in Tennessee and was white, <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> been burned, unlike any of the {{suspected}} victims. She also had a hysterectomy and tracheotomy, which {{none of the other}} victims had. Also, it has not been stated if her remains were located near a highway. Her hair color was impossible to determine because of the condition of the body.|$|E
25|$|The {{post-mortem}} examination report {{was released on}} 23 February.

25|$|The orange mohair sweater {{belonging}} to the victim {{was found in a}} deserted farmhouse just 100 yards from the desolate road on which <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> been placed after her murder. Glass particles found within this basement were of a similar consistency to those found upon the soles of Basom's shoes. Upon conducting a search of the basement of this farmhouse, investigators discovered a further garment of her clothing, a length of electrical flex of the same type used to strangle the victim, and fresh human bloodstains, indicating this location as being the site of Basom's murder.|$|E
25|$|Carolyn Nadine Davis, 14 years old, {{ran away}} from her home outside Anderson in Shasta County on February 6, 1973 but {{disappeared}} July 15 after being dropped off by her grandmother at the Garberville Post Office. She was last seen hitchhiking that afternoon near the Highway 101 ramp, southbound, in Garberville. Her body was discovered on July 31 just three feet from where the remains of Sterling and Weber had been recovered seven months prior. Cause of death was strychnine poisoning 10–14 days before discovery. It could not be determined {{if she had been}} raped. Investigators postulated that <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> been thrown from the road as the hillside brush appeared undisturbed.|$|E
25|$|On 18 August 1986 {{a victim}} was found {{buried in a}} {{depression}} of earth in the grounds of a collective farm {{in the city of}} Bataysk. The wounds inflicted upon this victim did seem to bear the trademark mutilations of victims linked to the manhunt killed between 1982 and 1985. The victim was an 18-year-old secretary named Irina Pogoryelova. Pogoryelova's body bore all the trademark mutilations of the previous victims: <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>had</b> been slit open from the neck to the genitalia, with one breast removed and her eyes cut out. As the murderer had made serious efforts to bury the body, some investigators theorized that this explained the sudden dearth in the number of victims found.|$|E
