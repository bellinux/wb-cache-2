40|$|Abstract. The thermalized {{energy from}} the {{radioactive}} decays of 56 Ni and 57 Ni and their daughter nuclides power the light curves of supernovae near maximum light. The bolometric light curve gives us a fundamental understanding of the energy evolution of a supernova explosion {{and the amount of}} radioactive nuclides produced. In this review, I will discuss the bolometric evolution of the Type IIp supernovae SN 1987 A, and the general class of bolometric light curves of Type Ia thermonuclear explosions. 1 SN 1987 A We have been monitoring the photometric properties of the Type IIp SN 1987 A in the LMC for more than 15 years. Over the first 5 years the optical photometry could be measured from the ground in the typical 1 ” seeing at our observatories. In the near infrared bands of JHK where the seeing is better and the crowding stars (which are typically bluer than the SN) are less of a problem, we could monitor the SN for up to 10 years. Once the supernova faded below the integrated magnitudes of the inner ring which lies at about 1 ” from the supernova debris, HST or ground-based AO imagery is needed to isolate the debris and <b>inner</b> <b>rin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Observations of {{the angular}} {{distribution}} of the water masers in the nucleus of NGC 4258 reveal {{the presence of a}} thin molecular disk in nearly perfect Keplerian orbit (Miyoshi et al. 1995; Greenhill et al. 1995). The observed water maser clumps are distributed in an annulus of <b>inner</b> radius <b>Rin</b> = 0. 13 pc and outer radius Rout= 0. 26 pc. NGC 4258 is also observed to contain a central X-ray source of inferred intrinsic luminosity is 4 × 10 40 ergs s − 1 over the 2 – 10 keV energy range (Makishima et al. 1994). We suggest that the molecular density is too high within the <b>inner</b> radius <b>Rin</b> and the temperature of the gas in the disk is too low to produce maser emission beyond the outer radius of the annulus. This interpretation implies that the accretion rate is ∼ 8 × 10 − 4 α M ⊙ yr − 1. The possibility that the masing region extends beyond the annulus could be ruled out.

According to the design experience of static metal seal, the yield strength of SPMC is {{higher than that of}} pipeline, which makes plastic flow happen more on pipeline surface to achieve reliable seal. Therefore, Q 345 is selected for SPMC, and its yield strength is 345 MPa. There is also a minimum contact width for the sealing surface, otherwise leakage will happen. With regard of sealing reliability of SPMC, loading force for installation, and minimal effect on pipeline strength, the sealing width, LAD, is 3 mm.|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of the stellar population in the Chamaeleon dark clouds are discussed. Spectral energy distributions, based on the extant photometric and spectroscopic data base and IRAS fluxes measured from coadded data taken at the position of each star, and spectral types allow placement of the stars in an H-R diagram. The age and mass distributions and the luminosity function for the Chamaeleon stars are compared {{to those in the}} Taurus-Auriga dark clouds and are found to be similar. A small subsample (eight of 36) of the Chamaeleon stars show unusual spectral energy distributions which seem best interpreted as arising from circumstellar disks whose <b>inner</b> regions (<b>R(in))</b> is less than 30 - 50 stellar radii) area devoid of material.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} a thin viscous disc surrounding a magnetic star, including the spin-down of the star by the magnetic torques it exerts on the disc. The transition from an accreting to a non-accreting state, and the change of the magnetic torque across the corotation radius rc are included in a generic way, the widths of the transition taken in the range suggested by numerical simulations. In addition to the standard accreting state, in which the star gradually moves into spin equilibrium with the disc, two more states are found. An accreting state can develop into a 'dead' disc state, with <b>inner</b> edge <b>rin</b> well outside corotation. More often, a 'trapped' state develops, in which rin stays close to corotation even at very low accretion rates. The long-term evolution of these two states is different. In the dead state the star spins down incompletely, retaining much of its initial spin. In the trapped state the star can asymptotically spin-down to arbitrarily low rates, with its angular momentum transferred to the disc. We identify these outcomes with respectively the rapidly rotating and the very slowly rotating classes of Ap stars and magnetic white dwarfs...|$|R

40|$|Par-Lup 3 - 4 {{is a very}} low-mass star (spectral type M 5) in the Lupus III star-forming region. The {{object is}} underluminous by ~ 4 mag when {{compared}} to objects of similar mass in the same association. To better understand the origin of its underluminosity, we have analyzed high angular resolution near-IR imaging data and mid-IR spectroscopy. We have also compared the SED of the target (from the optical to the sub-millimeter regime) to a grid of radiative transfer models of circumstellar disks. The diffraction-limited infrared observations do not show obvious extended emission, allowing us to put an upper limit to the disk outer radius of ~ 20 AU. The lack of extended emission, together with the non detection of a strong 9. 8 microns silicate in absorption indicates that Par-Lup 3 - 4 is probably in a Class II (rather than Class I) evolutionary stage. The SED of Par-Lup 3 - 4 resembles that of objects with edge-on disks seen in scattered light, that is, a double peaked-SED and a dip at ~ 10 microns. We can fit the whole SED with a single disk model with an inclination of 81 +/- 6 degrees which provides a natural explanation for the under-luminosity of the target. Our analysis allows to put constraints on the disk <b>inner</b> radius, <b>Rin</b> 10 microns, which indicates that dust processing has already taken place in Par-Lup 3 - 4.

40|$|We {{report on}} the results of a broad band (0. 1 - 200 keV) {{spectral}} study of Cyg X- 2 using two BeppoSAX observations taken in 1996 and 1997, respectively, for a total effective on-source time of ~ 100 ks. The color-color (CD) and hardness-intensity (HID) diagrams show that the source was in the horizontal branch (HB) and normal branch (NB) during the 1996 and 1997 observation, respectively. Five spectra were selected around different positions of the source in the CD/HID, two in the HB and three in the NB. These spectra are fit to a model consisting of a disk blackbody, a Comptonization component, and two Gaussian emission lines at ~ 1 keV and ~ 6. 6 keV, respectively. The addition of a hard power-law tail with photon index ~ 2, contributing ~ 1. 5 % of the source luminosity, improves the fit of the spectra in the HB. We interpret the soft component as the emission from the inner accretion disk, with inner temperature, k Tin, varying between ~ 0. 8 and ~ 1. 7 keV and <b>inner</b> radius, <b>Rin,</b> varying between ~ 26 and ~ 11 km (assuming an inclination angle of the system of 60 o). The Comptonization component is probably emitted by hot plasma (electron temperature k Te varying between ~ 3 and ~ 20 keV, optical depth tau ~ 11 - 0. 4, seed-photon temperature kTW ~ 1 - 2. 4 keV) surrounding the NS. The changes in the parameters of the blackbody component indicate that the inner rim of the disk approaches the NS surface when the source moves from the HB to the NB, i. e. as the (inferred) mass accretion rate increases. The parameters of the Comptonized component also change significantly when the source moves from the HB to the NB. We discuss possible scenarios which can explain these changes...|$|R

40|$|We {{observed}} the AGB stars S Ori, GX Mon and R Cnc with the MIDI instrument at the VLTI. We compared {{the data to}} radiative transfer models of the dust shells, where the central stellar intensity profiles were described by dust-free dynamic model atmospheres. We used Al 2 O 3 and warm silicate grains. Our S Ori and R Cnc data could be well described by an Al 2 O 3 dust shell alone, and our GX Mon data by a mix of an Al 2 O 3 and a silicate shell. The best-fit parameters for S Ori and R Cnc included photospheric angular diameters Theta(Phot) of 9. 7 +/- 1. 0 mas and 12. 3 +/- 1. 0 mas, optical depths tau(V) (Al 2 O 3) of 1. 5 +/- 0. 5 and 1. 35 +/- 0. 2, and <b>inner</b> radii <b>R(in)</b> of 1. 9 +/- 0. 3 R(Phot) and 2. 2 +/- 0. 3 R(Phot), respectively. Best-fit parameters for GX Mon were Theta(Phot) = 8. 7 +/- 1. 3 mas, tau(V) (Al 2 O 3) = 1. 9 +/- 0. 6, R(in) (Al 2 O 3) = 2. 1 +/- 0. 3 R(Phot), tau(V) (silicate) = 3. 2 +/- 0. 5, and R(in) (silicate) = 4. 6 +/- 0. 2 R(Phot). Our model fits constrain the chemical composition and the inner boundary radii of the dust shells, {{as well as the}} photospheric angular diameters. Our interferometric results are consistent with Al 2 O 3 grains condensing close to the stellar surface at about 2 stellar radii, co-located with the extended atmosphere and SiO maser emission, and warm silicate grains at larger distances of about 4 [...] 5 stellar radii. We verified that the number densities of aluminum can match that of the best-fit Al 2 O 3 dust shell near the inner dust radius in sufficiently extended atmospheres, confirming that Al 2 O 3 grains can be seed particles for the further dust condensation. Together with literature data of the mass-loss rates, our sample is consistent with a hypothesis that stars with low mass-loss rates form primarily dust that preserves the spectral properties of Al 2 O 3, and stars with higher mass-loss rate form dust with properties of warm silicates.

40|$|Multicolor (BV RI) light {{curves of}} the eclipsing {{classical}} nova V Per are presented, {{and a total}} of twelve new eclipse timings are measured for the system. When combined with previous eclipse timings from the literature, these timings yield a revised ephemeris for the times of mid-eclipse given by JD ⊙ = 2, 447, 442. 8260 (1) + 0. 107123474 (3) E. The eclipse profiles are analyzed with a parameter-fitting model that assumes four sources of luminosity: a white dwarf primary star, a main-sequence secondary star, a flared accretion disk with a rim, and a bright spot at the intersection of the mass-transfer stream and the disk periphery. Model parameters include the temperatures of the white dwarf (T 1) and the secondary star (T 2), the radius (Rd) and temperature (Td), of the disk periphery, the <b>inner</b> disk radius (<b>Rin),</b> the disk power-law temperature exponent (α) and thickness (hr), and a bright spot temperature enhancement factor (χs). A matrix of model solutions are computed, covering an extensive range of plausible parameter values. The solution matrix is then explored to determine the optimum values for the fitting parameters and their associated errors. For models that treat the accretion disk as a flat structure without a rim, optimum fits require that the disk have a flat temperature profile. Although models with a truncated inner disk (Rin>> R 1) result in a steeper temperature profile, steadystate models with a temperature profile characterized by T(r) ∝ r− 3 / 4 are found only for models with a significant disk rim.

40|$|An {{accretion}} disk around a rotating magnetized star {{is subjected to}} magnetic torques which induce disk warping and precession. These torques arise generically from interactions between the stellar field and the induced surface currents on the disk. Applying these new effects to weakly magnetized (B ∼ 10 7 – 10 9 G) neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries, we study the global hydrodynamical warping/precession modes of the disk under the combined influences of relativistic frame dragging, classical precession due to the oblateness of the neutron star, and the magnetic torques. Under quite general conditions, the magnetic warping torque can overcome the “Bardeen-Petterson ” viscous damping and makes the modes grow. The modes are confined to the inner region of the disk, and have frequencies equal to 0. 3 − 0. 95 (depending on the mass accretion rate ˙ M) times {{the sum of the}} Lense-Thirring frequency, the classical precession frequency, and the magnetically driven precession frequency evaluated at the <b>inner</b> disk radius <b>rin.</b> As M˙ increases, the mode frequency is reduced relative to the total precession frequency at rin since the mode becomes less concentrated around rin due to the increasing viscous stress associated with the large ˙ M. Because of this, and because the magnetically driven precession is retrograde (opposite to the Lense-Thirring precession) and depends strongly on ˙M, the mode frequency can have a non-monotonic dependence on the mass accretion rate. This may account for several observed features of low-frequency (10 – 60 Hz) quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) in low-mass X-ray binaries which are otherwise difficult to explain, such as the flattening/turnover in the LFQPO frequency – ˙ M correlation or in the LFQPO frequency – kHz QPO frequency correlation (e. g., as seen clearly in GX 17 + 2) ...|$|R

Specifically, in the PG quasar sample the equivalent width of the narrow [Oiii] λ 5007 line has a range of> 300 (< 0. 5 ˚A to 157 ˚A), while the broad Hβ line, for example, has a range of ten only (23 ˚A to 230 ˚A). The strength of [Oiii] λ 5007 is modulated by the covering factor (CF) of the narrow line region (NLR) gas, its density (ne), and ionization parameter (U). To explore which of these factors produces the observed large range in [Oiii] λ 5007 strength, we measure {{the strength of the}} matching narrow Hβ and [Oiii] λ 4363 lines, detected in 40 out of the 87 z < 0. 5 PG quasars in the Boroson & Green sample. The photoionization code CLOUDY is then used to infer CF, ne, and U in each object, assuming a single uniform emitting zone. We find that the range of CF (∼ 0. 02 − 0. 2) contributes about twice as much as the range in both ne and U towards modulating the strength of the [Oiii] λ 5007 line. The CF is inversely correlated with luminosity, but it is not correlated with L/LEdd as previously speculated. The single zone [Oiii] λ 5007 emitting region is rather compact, having RNLR = 40 L 0. 45 44 pc. These emission lines can also be fit with an extreme two zone model, where [Oiii] λ 4363 is mostly emitted by a dense (ne = 107 cm− 3) <b>inner</b> zone at <b>Rin</b> NLR = L 0. 5 44 pc, and [Oiii] λ 5007 by a low density (ne = 103 cm− 3) extended outer zone at Rout NLR = 750 L 0. 34 44 pc.
