25|$|Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry {{stated that}} he {{expected}} Clinton to face some tough questions, but thought she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> good job at (being Secretary of State). Christopher Hitchens of Vanity Fair called her nomination a ludicrous embarrassment on the edition of November 18, 2008 of Hardball due to the Clintons' overseas connections, her actions during the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary. Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) voted against a unanimous voice approval, citing ethical concerns. He sought not to block the nomination through a filibuster, but to voice his opposition to her policies. Senator David Vitter (R-Louisiana) also voted against Clinton in Committee citing her husband's foreign donations for his non-profit entities.|$|E

500|$|Awesome Dre was {{originally}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> verse on [...] "Taste." [...] While Insane Clown Posse {{waited in the}} studio for him to arrive, Esham suggested that he appear on the track instead {{for the same amount}} of money, and the group allowed him to record a verse. Esham was paid $500 for his appearance. Kid Rock demanded a hundred more than Esham, and was paid $600 to appear on [...] "Is That You?" [...] He showed up to record the song intoxicated, but re-recorded his vocals and record scratching the following day.|$|E

500|$|Preparations for {{the tour}} began as early as 1986, when Bowie warned his band to [...] "be ready for next year." [...] Bowie was {{initially}} mum on his plans for his tour, saying only [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> stage thing this year, which I'm incredibly excited about, 'cause I'm gonna take a chance again."

500|$|After {{the release}} of The Avengers in May 2012, Tom Russo of Boston.com noted that aside from the {{occasional}} [...] "novelty" [...] such as Aliens vs. Predator (2004), {{the idea of a}} shared universe was virtually unheard of in Hollywood. Since that time, the shared universe model created by Marvel Studios has begun to be replicated by other film studios that held rights to other comic book characters. In April 2014, Tuna Amobi, a media analyst for Standard & Poor's Equity Research Services, stated that in the previous three to five years, Hollywood studios began planning [...] "megafranchises" [...] for years to come, opposed to working one blockbuster at a time. Amobi added, [...] "A lot of these superhero characters were just being left there to gather dust. Disney has proved that this [...] can be a gold mine." [...] However, with additional studios now [...] "playing the megafranchise game", Doug Creutz, media analyst for Cowen and Company, feels the allure will eventually die for audiences: [...] "If Marvel's going to make two or three films a year, and Warner Brothers is going to do at least a film every year, and Sony's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> film every year, and Fox [...] <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> film every year, can everyone do well in that scenario? I'm not sure they can." ...|$|E
500|$|The storyline {{received}} {{attention from the}} Australian Family Association, with spokesman John Morrissey {{saying that he was}} concerned about TV [...] "normalising" [...] same-sex relationships. Psychologist Dr Janet Hall praised the storyline, saying it allows families to discuss the topic. Susan Bower defended the kiss, which was shot before the Home and Away controversy, saying [...] "Ours is a lovely tale about friendship. It's very innocent." [...] She added [...] "If we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> lesbian story – and [...] "Neighbours" [...] is not against lesbian stories – we would do it properly.

500|$|Scrubs had {{previously}} dabbled {{in the musical}} genre, including a West Side Story parody in the episode [...] "My Way or the Highway," [...] and a Broadway-style finale in [...] "My Philosophy." [...] However, Lawrence had long been unwilling to do full musical episode, because of difficulties making it [...] "organic to the show," [...] {{and because of the}} amount of work that would inevitably be involved. Finally, at the end of Season 5, with Season 6 looking like it would probably be the last season; Lawrence told the writers that if they were ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> musical episode, it should be in Season 6.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of her seventh studio album Ray of Light (1998), Madonna stated in a live {{interview}} with Larry King on January 19, 1999 that [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> movie in April; The Next Best Thing, and then I am going to rehearse to go on tour. And then I'll probably play up until the millennium, New Year's Eve." [...] The tour was delayed until 2001, as she had, in her own words, [...] "been distracted by having children and filming movies". She also began a serious relationship with Guy Ritchie in 1999. By 2000, she had become pregnant with her son Rocco Ritchie, released her eighth studio album Music that year, and married Ritchie in December 2000.|$|E
500|$|Since Grohl {{felt the}} songs were {{different}} from the band's previous input and [...] "had {{the potential to be}} something great", he considered that instead of doing something like the last three albums, the band had to go out of [...] "our own comfort zone" [...] and [...] "needed someone to push us out of there". So Grohl decided to work again with Gil Norton, who produced the band's second album The Colour and the Shape, citing how Norton taught the band of the importance of pre-production and refining the composition, and claiming Norton's [...] "unconventional" [...] approach [...] "seems to capture the best of this band", considering that with him [...] "we're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> straightforward AC/DC record, he's gonna make it different".|$|E

500|$|Upon the {{retirement}} of Ricky Ponting from international Twenty20 cricket, there were some calls for White to be promoted to captain the side, led by his Victoria coach Greg Shipperd. [...] Despite these calls, White backed the favourite, incumbent vice-captain Michael Clarke for the role. White was eventually named as Clarke's vice-captain, although worries about Clarke's injury-prone back and his struggles with form in Twenty20 resulted in continued calls for White to take over, though White again backed Clarke, claiming [...] "Michael's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> great job and I'll just {{look forward to working}} with him.

500|$|In October 2004, Brosnan said he {{considered}} himself dismissed from the role. Although Brosnan had been rumoured frequently as {{still in the}} running to play 007, he had denied it several times, and in February 2005 he posted on his website that he was finished with the role. Daniel Craig took over the role on 14 October 2005. In an interview with The Globe and Mail, Brosnan was asked {{what he thought of}} Daniel Craig as the new James Bond.

500|$|... "Woohoo" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics; {{most of them}} commended Aguilera's vocals and Minaj's appearance. However, the others were not impressed with the song's sexual nature. Sara D. Anderson of AOL Music said the [...] "provocative, dancehall track nicely fuses Aguilera's powerful voice with Minaj's MC tactics". Benjamin Boles of Now Magazine called the track the top track on Bionic, commenting that Minaj's cameo [...] "rescues" [...] the song. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian said, [...] "If you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> five-minute song about cunnilingus, it's {{a good idea to}} enlist foul-mouthed rapper Nicki Minaj, whose bug-eyed contribution lends the proceedings an air of gripping abandon." [...] Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy called the song [...] "sexually explicit, funky club pop", saying [...] "In Nicki Minaj, Aguilera has found the perfect partner for her erotic-pop adventures". He also called the song a [...] "dirtier cousin of Rihanna's 'Rude Boy' or 'Hollaback Girl'", and commended Minaj's verse.|$|E
5000|$|On 7 March 2011, Tempah {{expressed}} {{his desire for}} his next album to go triple platinum.

500|$|Although {{the joke}} {{originally}} stemmed from Evel Knievel and not Kanye West, Parker and Stone said they realized West {{would probably be}} extremely humorless about the joke and not understand it, so they decided the episode should revolve mostly around him. After {{coming up with the}} idea, Parker and Stone waited a long time before they finally wrote the script because, Stone said, [...] "It just seemed too dumb. Are we really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> whole episode about this?" [...] Stone said the jokes about Carlos Mencia were [...] "just a complete afterthought" [...] that came about during the writing process. During one scene in [...] "Fishsticks", Cartman steals credit from Jimmy for a joke he did not write. This was inspired by people Parker and Stone have worked with in the television business who were present for discussions the duo had, then later claimed credit for the idea even though they {{had nothing to do with}} it. Stone said, [...] "They truly believe they did it. That's the really sinister part. It's not where they're trying to steal part of the glory. ... They actually fully believe that they came up with it." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 16, 2009, a woman {{claimed to}} have {{suffered}} a head injury from riding Son of Beast during her visit to the park on May 31, 2009.

[...] "The first we heard of this was on June 16. Her visit was on May 31 and there's no record of going to first aid for anything here at the park," [...] said Don Helbig, public relations manager for Kings Island. Helbig {{also pointed out that}} there were no other reports of injuries on the ride that year. The Son of Beast was shut down as a precaution, however, during the investigation. [...] "At this point it would be inappropriate to speculate on an exact date when the ride may reopen. We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> thorough maintenance review.
