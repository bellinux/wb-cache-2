5|$|The Union Bank of Switzerland {{emerged in}} 1912 when the Bank in Winterthur fused with the Toggenburger Bank. The Bank in Winterthur, founded in 1862 with an <b>initial</b> <b>share</b> capital of CHF 5million, focused on {{providing}} financing for industry and other companies, and had profited considerably from its close railroad connections and large warehousing facilities during the American Civil War when cotton prices rose dramatically. The Toggenburger Bank {{was founded in}} 1863 with an <b>initial</b> <b>share</b> capital of CHF 1.5million, and specialized as a savings and mortgage bank for individual customers, maintaining a branch office network in eastern Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|The UERL {{was set up}} with {{an initial}} {{capitalisation}} of £5million (£ today). The company was backed by three merchant banks, Speyer Brothers in London, Speyer & Co. in New York and Old Colony Trust Company in Boston, each of which was to receive £250,000 from the capital raised. Almost 60 per cent of the <b>initial</b> <b>share</b> offering was bought in the United States, with a third sold in Britain and the rest mainly in the Netherlands. Further capital was soon needed for the construction works and additional share and bond issues followed. The UERL eventually raised a total of £18million (£ today).|$|E
5|$|Norway Airlines was {{established}} on 2 April 1987 by Kjell Adserø and his holding company Hell Holding, {{along with several}} other investors from Trøndelag—the largest of which was Lyng Industrier. The business model was to operate charter flights from Norway to the Mediterranean; {{eighty percent of the}} market was carried out with foreign airlines and Adserø believed that Norwegians not only would prefer a Norwegian carrier, but {{would be willing to pay}} more for one. The company had an <b>initial</b> <b>share</b> capital of NOK10 million and established its head office and main base at Stavanger Airport, Sola. Separate companies, organized as kommandittselskap, wer established to own each aircraft and lease them to the airline. The aircraft owner companies paid 28.7 million United States dollars for each Boeing 737-300, which were delivered new from Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Shares in the aircraft owning companies was offered to the public with a four-percent annual return on investment. Part of the investment model was based on tax advantages.|$|E
2500|$|Quantum key {{distribution}} {{is vulnerable to}} a man-in-the-middle attack when used without authentication {{to the same extent}} as any classical protocol, since no known principle of quantum mechanics can distinguish friend from foe. As in the classical case, Alice and Bob cannot authenticate each other and establish a secure connection without some means of verifying each other's identities (such as an <b>initial</b> <b>shared</b> secret). If Alice and Bob have an <b>initial</b> <b>shared</b> secret then they can use an unconditionally secure authentication scheme (such as Carter-Wegman,) along with quantum {{key distribution}} to exponentially expand this key, using a small amount of the new key to authenticate the next session. Several methods to create this <b>initial</b> <b>shared</b> secret have been proposed, for example using a 3rd party or chaos theory. Nevertheless, only [...] "almost strongly universal" [...] family of hash functions can be used for unconditionally secure authentication.|$|R

500|$|Meanwhile, in 1863, the Toggenburger Bank {{was founded}} in Lichtensteig, Switzerland with an <b>initial</b> <b>share</b> capital of CHF1.5million. [...] The Toggenburger Bank was a savings and {{mortgage}} bank for individual customers with a branch office network in Eastern Switzerland.

[...] Among the Bankverein's early backers was the Bank in Winterthur, {{one of the early}} predecessors of the Union Bank of Switzerland. [...] The bank experienced initial growing pains after heavy losses in Germany caused the bank to suspend its dividend in favor of a loss reserve. [...] By 1879, Basler Bankverein has accumulated enough capital to resume dividends, initially at an 8% annual rate and then increasing to 10% in 1880.|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} of accelerated channel is investigated for different classes of initial states. It is shown that, the capacities of the travelling channels {{depend on the}} frame in which the accelerated channels are observed in and the <b>initial</b> <b>shared</b> state between the partners. In some frames, the capacities decay as the accelerations of both qubit increase. The decay rate is larger if the partners are initially share a maximum entangled state. The possibility of using the accelerated quantum channels to perform quantum coding protocol is discussed. The amount of decoded information is quantified for different cases, where it decays as the partner's accelerations increase to reach its minimum bound. This minimum bound depends on the <b>initial</b> <b>shared</b> states and it is large for maximum entangled state...|$|R

500|$|In 1862, The Bank in Winterthur {{was founded}} in Winterthur, Switzerland, with an <b>initial</b> <b>share</b> capital of CHF5million. [...] The Bank in Winterthur {{operated}} primarily as a commercial bank, providing financing {{for a range of}} companies and projects. The bank would be involved in funding the Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works, the hotel Baur au Lac in Zurich and many other companies. [...] The bank capitalized on its location at an important Swiss railroad junction and its large warehousing facilities allowed the bank {{to take advantage of the}} dramatic rise in cotton prices caused by the American Civil War.

2500|$|Lord Gifford and his Bechuanaland Exploring Company had won {{the right}} to {{construct}} a private railway north from [...] the terminus of the Cape Government Railways at Kimberley into Bechuanaland in 1888. Rhodes was initially against this extension, in part because Gifford was a competitor but also for reasons of Cape politics. However, when Rhodes and Gifford joined forces, BSAC had to take on this railway obligation to gain its Charter. Rhodes promised that BSAC would spend £500,000 on building a railway through Bechuanaland, half of BSAC's total <b>initial</b> <b>share</b> capital. The railway reached Vryburg in 1890, stopping there until 1893 because of the poor financial state of BSAC and disappointing reports about gold in Mashonaland and Matabeleland. BSAC remained cautious about railway building until 1896, when African uprisings threatening its investment made railway links to Southern Rhodesia imperative.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} BTP, {{a protocol}} that ensures the confidential-ity, integrity, authenticity and forward secrecy of communication over diverse underlying transports, from low-latency, bidirectional transports like TCP to high-latency, unidirectional transports like DVDs sent through the mail. BTP {{is designed for}} use in censorship-resistant delay-tolerant overlays that operate over heterogeneous mixtures of underlying transports. By providing consistent security properties for a very wide range of transports, BTP simplifies the design and implemen-tation of such overlays. Forward secrecy is achieved by establishing an <b>initial</b> <b>shared</b> se-cret between each pair of endpoint devices and using a one-way key derivation function to generate a series of temporary shared secrets from the <b>initial</b> <b>shared</b> secret. Once both devices have de-stroyed a given temporary secret, any keys derived from it cannot be re-derived if the devices are later compromised. BTP {{is designed to be}} compatible with traffic analysis preven-tion techniques such as traffic morphing: the protocol includes op-tional padding and uses no timeouts, handshakes or plaintext head-ers, with the goal of making it difficult to distinguish BTP from other protocols. If unlinkability between communicating devices is required, BTP can use anonymity systems such as Tor and Mixmin-ion as underlying transports...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{distribution}} dynamics of productivity in European regions displays polarization with a nonlinear growth path. We investigate the factors explaining this behavior focusing in particular on sectoral composition. The beta-convergence analysis reveals that <b>initial</b> <b>shares</b> of Manufacturing and Other Market Services have a nonlinear impact on growth, while spatial effects are not statistically significant. By decomposing the dynamics of aggregate productivity in terms of sectoral dynamics, we show that productivity in Manufacturing, Non Market Services, and Other Market Services does not converge, for the complex interaction of technological spillovers and specialization effects...|$|R
