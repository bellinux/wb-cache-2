5|$|On the {{one hand}} there are very many people who, if they read any poetry at all, try to take all its {{statements}} seriously – and find them silly... This may seem an absurd mistake but, alas! it is none the less common. On the other hand {{there are those who}} succeed too well, who swallow 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty...,' as the quintessence of an aesthetic philosophy, not as the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> certain blend of feelings, and proceed into a complete stalemate of muddle-mindedness {{as a result of their}} linguistic naivety.|$|E

5|$|Three prime untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of {{messenger}} RNAs (mRNAs) often contain regulatory sequences that post-transcriptionally cause RNA interference. Such 3'-UTRs often contain both binding {{sites for}} microRNAs (miRNAs) {{as well as}} for regulatory proteins. By binding to specific sites within the 3'-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript. The 3'-UTR also may have silencer regions that bind repressor proteins that inhibit the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mRNA.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden {{was both}} a {{theoretician}} and a practitioner of theater. That {{he was in no}} small measure a theoretician – for example, he was interested almost from the start in having set design seriously support the themes of his plays – relates to a key property of Yiddish theater {{at the time of its}} birth: in general, writes Bercovici, theory ran ahead of practice. Much of the Jewish community, Goldfaden included, were already familiar with contemporary theater in other languages. The initial itinerary of Goldfaden's company – Iaşi, Botoşani, Galaţi, Brăila, Bucharest – could as easily have been the itinerary of a Romanian-language troupe. Yiddish theater may have been seen from the outset as an <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Jewish national character, but the theatrical values of Goldfaden's company were in many ways those of a good Romanian theater of the time. Also, Yiddish was a German dialect which became a well-known language even among non-Jews in Moldavia (and Transylvania), an important language of commerce; the fact that one of the first to write about Yiddish theater was Romania's national poet, Mihai Eminescu, is testimony that interest in Yiddish theater went beyond the Jewish community.|$|E

5|$|In bioinformatics, microarrays {{are used}} to measure how {{strongly}} different genes are expressed {{in a sample of}} biological material. Different rates of <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gene are often compared by using the binary logarithm of the ratio of expression rates: the log ratio of two expression rates is defined as the binary logarithm of the ratio of the two rates. Binary logarithms allow for a convenient comparison of expression rates: a doubled expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , a halved expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , and an unchanged expression rate can be described by a log ratio of zero, for instance.|$|E

25|$|The ABC {{model of}} flower {{development}} was first formulated by George Haughn and Chris Somerville in 1988. It {{was first used}} as a model to describe the collection of genetic mechanisms that establish floral organ identity in the Rosids, as exemplified by Arabidopsis thaliana, and the Asterids, as demonstrated by Antirrhinum majus. Both species have four verticils (sepals, petals, stamens and carpels), which are defined by the differential <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of homeotic genes present in each verticil. This means that the sepals are solely characterized by the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> genes, while the petals are characterized by the co-expression of A and B genes. The B and C genes establish {{the identity of the}} stamens and the carpels only require C genes to be active. It should be noted that type A and C genes are reciprocally antagonistic.|$|E
25|$|The TGF-β {{superfamily}} activates {{members of}} the SMAD family, which function as transcription factors. Specifically, the type I receptor, activated by the type II receptor, phosphorylates R-SMADs that then bind to the co-SMAD, SMAD4. The R-SMAD/Co-SMAD forms a complex with importin and enters the nucleus, where they act as transcription factors and either up-regulate or down-regulate in the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> target gene.|$|E

25|$|The term “retro” or “retro-aesthetic” {{became popular}} in the mass culture of the nineties, rather than through any art connection.

25|$|Although myth was {{traditionally}} {{transmitted through}} {{the oral tradition}} on a small scale, the film industry has enabled filmmakers to transmit myths to large audiences via film. In Jungian psychology myths are the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> culture or society’s goals, fears, ambitions and dreams. Film {{is an expression of}} the society in which it was produced and reflects the culture of its era and location.|$|E
25|$|The romantic idea of {{enlightenment}} as insight into a timeless, transcendent reality has been popularized especially by D.T. Suzuki. Further popularization {{was due to}} the writings of Heinrich Dumoulin. Dumoulin viewed metaphysics as the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transcendent truth, which according to him was expressed by Mahayana Buddhism, but not by the pragmatic analysis of the oldest Buddhism, which emphasizes anatta. This romantic vision is also recognizable in the works of Ken Wilber.|$|E
