40|$|The <b>fluted</b> <b>scale</b> Crypticerya multicicatrices (Hemiptera: Monophlebidae) is an {{invasive}} insect {{that became}} a major pest {{on the island of}} San Andrés. To generate control strategies for this insect, its distribution and infestation levels on palm species, fruit trees, leguminous trees and other plant species were determined during January 14 – 18, 2013. A total of 96 points were sampled {{in order to determine the}} distribution of the insect on the island. During the study, the <b>fluted</b> <b>scale</b> was found distributed throughout the island of San Andrés, including Haynes Cay and Johnny Cay. The palms were the plants with the highest levels of infestation, 70. 8 % had some degree of infestation (37. 5 % high infestation levels); followed by fruit trees which had 65. 6 % with some degree of infestation (30. 2 % high infestation levels); followed by leguminous trees which had 59. 6 % with some degree of infestation (13. 5 % high infestation levels) and finally “other hosts” which had 51. 1 % with some level of infestation (11. 5 % high infestation levels). This study is the first detailed mapping of C. multicicatrices on the island of San Andrés which will become the basis for future work on the population dynamics of the <b>fluted</b> <b>scale</b> and its distribution on the island...|$|E

(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae: Noviini), {{known as}} an {{important}} natural enemy of the Colombian <b>fluted</b> <b>scale,</b> Crypticeria muticicatrices Kondo and Gullan (Hemiptera: Coccoidea: Monophlebidae) is here identified as A. punica Gordon, 1972, and reported {{for the first time}} from Peru. Here we provide information and illustrations of the great variation in color and dorsal patterns of A. punica found in Colombia and Peru...|$|E
40|$|The Colombian <b>fluted</b> <b>scale</b> (CFS), Crypticerya multicicatrices Kondo & Unruh (Hemiptera: Monophlebidae) is a {{polyphagous}} scale insect which affects about 100 species of plants. Between 2010 – 2013, the species was reported as an invasive pest {{on the islands}} of San Andres and Old Providence, Colombian territory in the Caribbean sea. Currently, populations of the CFS also have increased {{in the city of}} Cali, Valle del Cauca State, mainland Colombia, affecting different host plants, especially leguminous trees such as Caesalpinia peltophoroides Benth., Pithecellobium dulce (Roxb.) Benth., P. saman (Jacq.) Benth. (Fabaceae) and mango, Mangifera indica L. (Anacardiaceae). With the aim of searching for natural enemies to control the CFS, field studies were conducted in the city of Cali between February 2013 and October 2014. As a result of this study, two species of lady beetles were found feeding on CFS, i. e., Anovia punica Gordon and Rodolia cardinalis (Mulsant) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). This is the first record of R. cardinalis preying on CFS...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{introductions}} of natural enemies of insects, weeds and other organisms {{have taken place}} in the Caroline and Marshall islands, especially since 1945. Rodolia pumila and several other species of coccinellids have been widely distributed for control of Icerya spp. and Aspidiolus destructor. Many of these species successfully established on the high islands of Micronesia. On atolls, sketchy information suggests that R. pumila established, dramatically reduced populations of <b>fluted</b> <b>scales,</b> and then became extinct. Periodic reintroductions seem necessary to maintain these predators on atolls. Other successful introductions include a variety of predators and parasites for control of Oryctes rhinoceros including a virus, several parasitic Hymenoptera directed against Aleyrodidae, predatory snails for control of giant African snail, and a variety of insects for the control or lantana and clidemia. Though many of the biological control agents are known to have established, little information is available as to their impact on target pests...|$|R
5000|$|This species {{grows to}} {{a length of}} up to 9 cm. The solid, large shell has an ovate-pointed shape. This is a very {{variable}} species. The color pattern of the shell is cream, irregularly maculated with greenish and brown, and broken lines of black. The apex is almost always pink. The six whorls are convex, separated by subcanaliculate sutures. The upper two whorls are smooth, the lower spirally lirate and radiately more or less squamose striate. The lirae are sometimes subequal and nearly smooth. The main body whorl has 20 distinct spiral ribs, mostly flat-topped, some with <b>fluted</b> <b>scales.</b> The body whorl contains about thirteen lirae, which are generally wider than their interstices, and of which the subcoronal {{and one or two}} median ones are more prominent. The penultimate and last whorl bear numerous elevated vaulted scales upon the lirae. The aperture is pearly white or brownish tinted within, about half the length of the shell. It is round-ovate, angled above, dilated and subchannelled below. The columella is thickened, somewhat flattened and grooved below the narrow deeply perforating umbilicus. T ...|$|R
