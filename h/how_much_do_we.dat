Truly Ennia's God and yours must have stood beside you, though I saw them not. How else could you have been so strong and fearless? Ennia thought so too. She told me so one night when the house was asleep, and I only watching beside her. 'My God was with him,' she said. 'None other could have given him the strength to battle with the lion. He will bring him to Himself in good time, and I shall meet him again.' She said something about your knowing that she was a Christian. But, of course, you could not have known that." ...|$|E

60|$|Remark, meanwhile, how from {{amid the}} wrecks and dust of this {{universal}} Decay new Powers are fashioning themselves, {{adapted to the}} new time and its destinies. Besides the old Noblesse, originally of Fighters, {{there is a new}} recognised Noblesse of Lawyers; whose gala-day and proud battle-day even now is. An unrecognised Noblesse of Commerce; powerful enough, with money in its pocket. Lastly, powerfulest of all, least recognised of all, a Noblesse of Literature; without steel on their thigh, without gold in their purse, but with the 'grand thaumaturgic faculty of Thought' in their head. French Philosophism has arisen; in which little word <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> include! Here, indeed, lies properly the cardinal symptom of the whole wide-spread malady. Faith is gone out; Scepticism is come in. Evil abounds and accumulates: no man has Faith to withstand it, to amend it, to begin by amending himself; it must even go on accumulating. While hollow langour and vacuity is the lot of the Upper, and want and stagnation of the Lower, and universal misery is very certain, what other thing is certain? That a Lie cannot be believed! Philosophism knows only this: her other belief is mainly that, in spiritual supersensual matters no Belief is possible. Unhappy! Nay, as yet the Contradiction of a Lie is some kind of Belief; but the Lie with its Contradiction once swept away, what will remain? The five unsatiated Senses will remain, the sixth insatiable Sense (of vanity); the whole daemonic nature of man will remain,--hurled forth to rage blindly without rule or rein; savage itself, yet with all the tools and weapons of civilisation; a spectacle new in History.|$|E

40|$|In the {{following}} paper, we discuss {{and evaluate the}} benefits that deep syntactic trees (tectogrammatics) and all the rich annotation of the Prague Dependency Treebank bring {{to the process of}} annotating the discourse structure, i. e. discourse relations, connectives and their arguments. The decision to annotate discourse structure directly on the trees contrasts with the majority of similarly aimed projects, usually based on the annotation of linear texts. Our basic assumption is that some syntactic features of a sentence analysis correspond to certain discourselevel features. Hence, we use some properties of the dependency-based large-scale treebank of Czech to help establish an independent annotation layer of discourse. The question that we answer in the paper is <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> gain by employing this approach...|$|R
