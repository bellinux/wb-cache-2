After that he gave darshana from a car or his porte chair. After 2004, Sai Baba used a wheelchair and began to make fewer public appearances.|$|R

50|$|In pure iron, {{the crystal}} {{structure}} has relatively little {{resistance to the}} <b>iron</b> atoms <b>slipping</b> past one another, and so pure iron is quite ductile, or soft and easily formed. In steel, small amounts of carbon, other elements, and inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that otherwise occur in the crystal lattices of iron atoms.|$|R
50|$|Applications {{for use in}} this {{industry}} {{take full advantage of}} the many benefits electroless nickel has to offer. Deposit properties such as uniformity, corrosion resistance, lubricity and wear resistance are all reasons why the use of EN for automotive applications continues to grow. Historically, a cost sensitive market segment, auto makers have embraced the use low cost materials plated with a thin film of electroless nickel to meet strict requirements in an economical fashion. Fuel injection systems, aluminum fuel filters, brake pins and bleed valves are just a few applications that take full advantage of the depositâ€™s corrosion resistance. Differential pinion shafts and a variety of pins and washers are plated in large quantities due to the coatings lubricity, wear resistance and anti-galling properties (Figure 15). Brake pistons are plated in bright, medium phosphorus electroless nickel and heat treated to increase hardness and wear resistance. High deposit luster is desired and actually improves the surface finish of the piston resulting in reduced friction (Figure 16). Cast <b>iron</b> <b>slip</b> yokes are plated with EN to eliminate noise associated with galling.|$|R
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} those who killed in error went into {{banishment}}. One would go into banishment if, for example, while one was pushing a roller on a roof, the roller slipped over, fell, and killed someone. One would go into banishment if while one was lowering a cask, it fell down and killed someone. One would go into banishment if while coming down a ladder, one fell and killed someone. But one would not go into banishment if while pulling up the roller it fell back and killed someone, or while raising a bucket the rope snapped and the falling bucket killed someone, or while going up a ladder one fell down and killed someone. The Mishnah's general principle was that whenever the death occurred {{in the course of}} a downward movement, the culpable person went into banishment, but if the death did not occur {{in the course of a}} downward movement, the person did not go into banishment. If while chopping wood, the <b>iron</b> <b>slipped</b> from the ax handle and killed someone, Rabbi taught that the person did not go into banishment, but the sages said that the person did go into banishment. If from the split log rebounding killed someone, Rabbi said that the person went into banishment, but the sages said that the person did not go into banishment.|$|R
6000|$|The mingled {{fear and}} hatred in the speaker's face was {{certainly}} genuine, and Geoffrey said briefly: [...] "If I thought you guilty, I'd <b>slip</b> <b>irons</b> on to you. As it is, I'm willing to close that deal. You'll {{have to take}} my word and lie quiet, until you're wanted, where I hide you." ...|$|R

For behold, I {{received}} an iron knife in trade from the head man of the next village, and yesterday the <b>iron</b> knife <b>slipped</b> from my fingers and went down, down, into the sea. To all things there be law. Never was there one thing outside the law. This we know. And, moreover, we know that things of a kind have the one law, and that all iron has the one law. So unsay thy words, Nam-Bok, that we may yet honor thee." ...|$|R
50|$|Rio Grande Glaze Ware {{was fired}} in an oxygen rich atmosphere. The lead-based pigment yielded a black glazing paint despite the {{presence}} of oxygen, while iron-based, non-glazing pigment yielded a matte red paint. Red design elements were most often outlined in black. On most pots, background colors ranged from red to olive to yellow, achieved with clay <b>slips</b> containing <b>iron.</b> A white <b>slip</b> was sometimes achieved by using slip clay imported from the Acoma-Zuni region to the west.|$|R
60|$|They {{dropped a}} few men at places where work was going on, stopped for water, and crawled at slow speed over half-finished bridges and lengths of roughly graded line. After nightfall it grew bitterly cold and Prescott, lying on the boards with his blanket over him, shivered, half asleep. For the most part, {{darkness}} shut them in, {{but every now and}} then lights blazed beside the line and voices hailed the engineer as the pace decreased. Then, while the whistle shrieked, ballast cars on a side-track and tall <b>iron</b> frameworks <b>slipped</b> by, and they ran out again into the silent waste. Prescott was conscious of a continuous jolting which shook him to and fro; he thought he heard a confused altercation among his companions {{at the end of the}} car, and the clang of wheels and the shaking rails rang in measured cadence in his ears. Then the sounds died away and he fell into a heavy sleep.|$|R
60|$|My <b>irons</b> were <b>slipped,</b> and I {{squeezed}} myself {{between the}} gun and {{the side of the}} port, where I hung by my hands, against the ship's side. I might be seen, or I might not, caring little for the result. I was not seen by any but Marble and Neb, the former of whom caught me by the legs, as he passed beneath, and whispering to me to lie down {{in the bottom of the}} boat, he assisted me into the cutter. We actually rubbed against the captain's gig, as it was hauling up to the gangway; but no one suspected what had just taken place. This gig was the only one of the Speedy's boats that was in the water, at that hour, it having just been lowered to carry the captain ashore. In another minute we had dropped astern, Neb holding on by a boat-hook to one of the rudder-chains. Here we lay, until the gig pulled round, close to us, taking the direction toward the usual landing, with the captain of the Speedy in her.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{scenes of}} the film were shot at Border Thottam, at night. Arun Vijay stated that the film was {{primarily}} shot in night at second half. The team roped in Mumbai based model Debi Dutta for the kuthu number [...] "Poondhamalli Dhaan". The track was canned in TR Gardens in an enormous set resembling the famous Zam Bazaar at nights in a grand scale with 50 dancers and 150 junior artists. It was choreographed by Noble Master. Arun Vijay had developed a six-pack for this film. Rain had delayed the schedule and pushed back the release. The crew shot the climax at the Binny Mills for nine days. A factory set was erected with 15 feet fenced compound worth 4.5 million rupees. Art director Mohana Mahendran {{tried to find a}} live location but since he wasn't satisfied, the team erected a set of an old abandoned factory with machinery. A scene featuring Arun Vijay, Vamsi and his gang was shot there. Stunt director Anal Arasu composed a lengthy shot which was canned with four cameras. During the take Vamsi had to swing a huge iron bar against Arun Vijay in the end, where Arun has to miss it and jump. However, the <b>iron</b> bar <b>slipped</b> from Vamsi's hand and hit Arun's shoulder. Shoot was wrapped with few shots remaining.|$|R
40|$|The main Cenozoic extensional {{structure}} in the central Mojave Desert is the Waterman Hills detachment fault, which places brittlely deformed synorogenic Miocene rocks on ductilely and cataclastically deformed footwall rocks. New data are presented regarding the timing, distribution, magnitude, and significance of early Miocene extension in the area. The mylonitic fabric in the lower plate was formed at 23 Ma, based on a zircon U/Pb age from a synmylonitic intrusion. Upper plate strata consist of rhyolite flows overlain by sedimentary rocks that were apparently deposited during extensional faulting. These strata were tilted, folded, and intruded by synkinematic rhyolite plugs that are cut off at the detachment fault. Potassium metasomatism of the rhyolitic rocks is pervasive. Upper plate detrital sediment {{was derived from the}} rhyolitic rocks and from metamorphic and plutonic basement rocks not present in the area. The probable source of the exotic basement clasts is the Alvord Mountain area, presently located 35 km east-northeast of the Waterman Hills area. This source was probably much nearer to the Waterman Hills during deposition of the synorogenic deposits and has been subsequently shifted by extensional deformation. Distinctive Mesozoic plutonic rocks provide a possible tie between upper and lower plate rocks. Similar poikilitic gabbro bodies in the Goldstone area and the <b>Iron</b> Mountains suggest <b>slip</b> on the Waterman Hills detachment fault to be about 40 - 50 km. This is also consistent with other offset markers, such as the western edge of a Mesozoic dike swarm. When 15 - 20 km(?) of Tertiary extension is restored, Paleozoic eugeoclinal rocks are placed structurally above their miogeoclinal counterparts. Combined with the distribution of Triassic and Jurassic rocks, this implies post-Early Triassic and pre-Late Jurassic stacking of these lithologies...|$|R
60|$|His {{handcuffs}} {{were the}} first consideration. At first he saw no method of removing them, and feared that he should thus be baffled in the very outset; but upon a closer scrutiny he discovered that the <b>irons</b> could be <b>slipped</b> off and on at pleasure, with very little effort or inconvenience, merely by squeezing his hands through them,--this species of manacle being altogether ineffectual in confining young persons, in whom the smaller bones readily yield to pressure. He now untied his feet, and, leaving the cord {{in such a manner}} that it could easily be readjusted in the event of any person's coming down, proceeded to examine the bulkhead where it joined the berth. The partition here was of soft pine board, an inch thick, and he saw that he should have little trouble in cutting his way through. A voice was now heard at the forecastle companion-way, and he had just time to put his right hand into its handcuff (the left had not been removed) and to draw the rope in a slipknot around his ankle, when Dirk Peters came below, followed by Tiger, who immediately leaped into the berth and lay down. The dog had been brought on board by Augustus, who knew my attachment to the animal, and thought it would give me pleasure to have him with me during the voyage. He went up to our house for him immediately after first taking me into the hold, but did not think of mentioning the circumstance upon his bringing the watch. Since the mutiny, Augustus had not seen him before his appearance with Dirk Peters, and had given him up for lost, supposing him to have been thrown overboard by some of the malignant villains belonging to the mate's gang. It appeared afterward that he had crawled into a hole beneath a whale-boat, from which, not having room to turn round, he could not extricate himself. Peters at last let him out, and, with a species of good feeling which my friend knew well how to appreciate, had now brought him to him in the forecastle as a companion, leaving at the same time some salt junk and potatoes, with a can of water, he then went on deck, promising to come down with something more to eat on the next day.|$|R
5000|$|From {{an early}} German folk {{tale of the}} same name. A farmer's wife drives her husband mad with her desperate {{measures}} to have a baby. She says to him that she wants a child so badly, she would not care how he looked {{even if he were}} covered in quills like a hedgehog. That, of course, is what she gets: a baby covered in quills, as soft as feathers. His mother calls him 'Hans My Hedgehog' and she is the only one to love him; his father grows to hate him for shame. So eventually Hans leaves for a place where he cannot hurt anyone and where no-one can hurt him. Deep inside the forest, for many years Hans dwells with his animals for companions. One day a king gets lost in Hans' forest and hears a beautiful song being played on a bagpipe. He follows the music and finds Hans' castle. When Hans helps him to escape the forest, the King promises that he will give to Hans the first thing to greet him at his castle - which the King secretly expects will be his dog. Instead, {{it turns out to be}} his beautiful daughter, the Princess of sweetness and cherry pie. Hans and the King have made a deal that in exactly one year and one day his prize (the princess) shall be his. A year and one day later Hans returns to the castle. The princess says she knows what she must do. Hans asks her if she finds him ugly and she replies that he is not nearly as ugly as a broken promise. They are married, to the dismay of the entire kingdom. On their wedding night, the princess awaits her husband in bed. He comes into the chamber with his bagpipes and takes a seat by the fire and begins to play the same beautiful music that saved the king a year prior. The Princess is soothed by the music and dozes off. She wakes and finds a pelt of quills as soft as feathers on the ground before the fire. She sees her husband in the form of a handsome young man freeing the animals of the castle, to live with his friends in his forest castle. He knows she has seen him when he finds her slumbering on the discarded quills the following night. He tells her that he is bewitched and only if she can keep his secret for one more night can he be freed and remain in the form of the handsome man. She agrees. The next morning at breakfast the Queen inquires why her daughter is so cheerful. The Princess tries to resist but as her mother pries she gives in and tells her that Hans is bewitched. The Queen says that the only way to reverse the spell is to fling the quills in the fire. That night when Hans sheds his quills, she obeys her mother and burns them. She hears his screams of pain as if he were aflame, and Hans runs from the castle. The Princess has a blacksmith make her three pairs of solid <b>iron</b> shoes and <b>slips</b> away in search of her husband. She wears the shoes to nothing and moves on to the second pair, with still no sign of Hans. When she is donning the third pair of shoes, she finds a river and reclines by it, taking off the shoes and rubbing her sore feet. Catching sight of her reflection, she sees that her hair has grown white. She weeps bitterly for her hair and her husband, forever lost. The next day she comes to a cottage, abandoned, covered in dust and cobwebs. Then comes the flapping of wings and she sees her husband whom she had so long searched for. He toasts a glass of wine to no-one, [...] "to the beautiful woman who could not keep her promise." [...] She speaks to him and he becomes rigid and asks how she found him. She tells him. She tells him all of the perils that she has faced and how she has walked the world and worn through three pairs of iron shoes. Then she flings herself into his embrace and with her confession of love and loyalty, he transforms into the handsome man, the spell lifted by her fidelity and affection. The Storyteller states that he was given the final pair of the Princess' third pair of shoes which were worn down to nothing.|$|R
