In October 2014, the city of Seattle began exploring legal action over Onni's failure to secure the site; KIRO-TV reported that at least 10 squatters occupied the building, whose first floor had been boarded up.|$|E
5|$|Between 1978 and 1980, the DoD and USN {{repeatedly}} {{attempted to}} terminate the AV-8B program. There had previously been conflict between the USMC and USN over budgetary <b>issues.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time, the USN wanted to procure A-18s for its ground attack force and, to cut costs, pressured the USMC to adopt the similarly-designed F-18 fighter instead of the AV-8B to fulfill the role of close air support (both designs were eventually amalgamated to create the multirole F/A-18 Hornet). Despite these bureaucratic obstacles, in 1981, the DoD included the Harrier II in its annual budget and five-year defense plan. The USN declined {{to participate in the}} procurement, citing the limited range and payload compared with conventional aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Dozzell {{took his}} first step into {{management}} with Eastern Counties Football League club Ipswich Wanderers in 2003. In his role as player-manager, he moved to play in defence and secured an eighth-place finish in the league during his first season with the club. The following season, he {{led them to the}} league title and promotion to the Eastern Counties League Premier Division. The 2005–06 season saw Dozzell lead the newly promoted club to seventh in the league, but despite ending the season with a record tally of points, he left the Wanderers, citing off-pitch <b>issues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> club.|$|E
5|$|Russell repeats {{his opening}} monologue, {{but with the}} revelation {{that he is in}} fact hiding behind a fake wall the robbers had {{constructed}} inside the bank's supply room. He emerges a week after the robbery with the contents of Case's safe deposit box, including incriminating documents and several bags of diamonds. On his way out, he bumps into Frazier, who does not recognize him. When Frazier opens the safe deposit box, he finds the ring and a note from Russell. Frazier confronts Case and urges White to contact the Office of War Crimes <b>Issues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> State Department about Case's war crimes. At home, Frazier finds a loose diamond, slipped into his pocket by Russell.|$|E
5|$|The state's liquor {{prohibition}} law was a {{major political}} <b>issues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, and Talbot was a strict prohibitionist. During this term he vetoed {{a bill that would}} have disbanded the state police, which were charged with the law's enforcement, and also vetoed a bill replacing prohibition with a licensing scheme. In the 1874 election, anti-prohibition Republicans joined with Democrats to elect William Gaston over Talbot by a narrow margin. The election marked a watershed in post-Civil War Massachusetts, since it was the first victory for a Democrat in that period, and exposed the state Republican Party's fractures on domestic affairs like prohibition. Talbot refused to run in 1875.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{formation}} lap, Daniil Kvyat was unable to reach the grid due to an electrical issue. Therefore, the field went to another formation lap and the race was shortened accordingly to 57 laps. At the start proper, Vettel got away well, passing through both Mercedes cars into the lead, followed by his teammate Räikkönen in second. As Rosberg and Hamilton went through the first corner, Hamilton was forced wide and lost additional places, falling down to sixth. Kevin Magnussen suffered a puncture on the first lap and made a pit stop for new tyres, while Esteban Gutiérrez had mechanical <b>issues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back of the field. Hamilton was able to pass fifth-placed Massa on lap four, as Vettel was leading from Räikkonen, Rosberg and Verstappen. On lap eight, Sainz {{was the first of the}} top-ten runners to pit for new tyres. Meanwhile, Hamilton was unable to pass Verstappen for fourth, discussing alternative tactics with his team on the radio communication. Pascal Wehrlein had a good start in his debut as well, running in 14th place at that point of the race.|$|E
5|$|By the 1994 NBA All-Star Game, {{speculation}} as {{to whether}} or not the Timberwolves would remain in Minneapolis following the 1994–95 season became an issue. On February 11, 1994, NBA commissioner David Stern announced that he and his representatives would serve as mediators in an effort to resolve issues related to the debt owed on the Target Center, the Timberwolves home arena. The Timberwolves ownership was seeking a public or private entity to purchase the $73 million remaining on the arena's mortgage, otherwise the team would be sold and in all likelihood moved from Minnesota. Although mediation talks were just beginning to keep the team in place, by the following week it was revealed that ownership had met with representatives from San Diego, Nashville and New Orleans to discuss the potential relocation of the franchise. By late February, New Orleans emerged as the likely city for the team to relocate to if a deal could not be reached to keep the team in Minneapolis. This became the case after the potential ownership group Top Rank signed a letter of intent to purchase the team and move it to New Orleans if debt <b>issues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Target Center were not resolved.|$|E
5|$|Hasselbaink {{was born}} on 27 March 1972 in Paramaribo, Suriname (then part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands), to Frank Ware and Cornelli Hasselbaink; he was the {{youngest}} of six children. At the age of three Hasselbaink was run over by a moped which broke his right leg. In October 1978, his mother took him and three siblings to live in Zaandam, Netherlands; his father remained in Suriname and rarely contacted the family. The next year Hasselbaink began playing youth football for Gestaagt Volharding Overwint (GVO), initially as a goalkeeper. He later played for Zaansche Football club (ZFC) and Zaanlandia as a right winger. He joined a street gang as a teenager and spent three months in a youth detention facility for stealing. After his release he joined the youth team at DWS, but was dismissed from the club for stealing the watch of a first-team player. He began his senior career with Telstar, while still a gang member, and had disciplinary <b>issues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> club due to his persistent lateness. He made his Eerste Divisie debut on 27 October 1990, in a 2–0 defeat at VVV-Venlo. Head coach Niels Overweg dismissed him after he turned up late to a match.|$|E

5|$|Long War is {{a partial}} {{conversion}} mod for XCOM: Enemy Unknown and XCOM: Enemy Within. It was first uploaded to NexusMods on 4 January 2013, and exited beta {{with the release}} of version 1.0 on 28 December 2015. The developers announced in July 2015 with beta 15f2 that they had finished adding new features, and that any future releases would only correct bugs or balance <b>issues.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time that it exited beta, the mod's development was led by four core members, JohnnyLump (John J. Lumpkin), Amineri (Rachel Norman), XMarksTheSpot, and Ellatan (Alex Rozenfeld). They were joined by four senior contributors, 20 voice actors, and 29 contributors assisting with programming, art, sound engineering, translations, research, and porting the mod to Mac and Linux. Three members of Firaxis Games also provided assistance. The team released separate versions for Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within until the end of 2013, and thereafter only released versions for Enemy Within. Long War has been downloaded from NexusMods over 900,000 times by over 333,000 separate users.|$|E
5|$|Olympus had {{a market}} {{capitalisation}} of ¥673billion on 13 October 2011, immediately before Woodford was sacked. By {{the end of}} the next day, the valuation had fallen to ¥422billion ($5.5billion). Analysts at Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Nomura Securities, concerned about corporate governance <b>issues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> company as well as its balance sheet, all immediately downgraded their stock ratings. Goldman Sachs, who had only upgraded its rating in a report dated 12 October, suspended its coverage after Woodford was removed from office. Nomura and JPMorgan announced on 20 October that their coverage of the company was halted. It was reported that Government of Singapore Investment Corp., the Singapore sovereign wealth fund {{which was one of the}} principal shareholders, immediately disposed of its 2percent stake on the first hint of scandal. The share price plunged several days running upon market fears that the shares would be delisted as the company could not meet its reporting mandatory deadline for its quarterly results; in the week to 18 November Nippon Life announced that its stake had been reduced by one-third, from 8.18 percent to 5.11 percent, because of the uncertainty; Mitsubishi reduced its stake from 10 percent to 7.6 percent.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} refers to <b>issues</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some {{of these issues}} are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases {{in which there is}} no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a Likert scale, they may be experiencing very different things.|$|E
