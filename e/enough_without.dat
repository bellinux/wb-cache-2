5|$|General Dynamics and BAE Systems, who {{received}} contracts in the Ground Combat Vehicle program, criticized the CBO report, saying {{they used the}} wrong vehicle in its analysis. Officials from both companies said they used the wrong notional model of the GCV that did {{not account for the}} change in requirements made by the Army or the advancements made in the technology development phase of the program. They also criticized the comparisons of the other vehicles. The report factored cost, survivability, mobility, and lethality, ranking the GCV's capabilities as lower than all others. The Army questioned the suitability of existing design. An Army test of currently fielded vehicles in 2012 revealed that some met critical GCV requirements, but none met <b>enough</b> <b>without</b> needing significant redesign. They also note that lethality was judged with a 25mm cannon for analysis, before the Army planned to mount a 30mm cannon. The CBO report did give credit to cost, assuming the Army's goal of $13 million per vehicle. However, Pentagon cost assessments estimated the price at $16–$17 million per vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the battle the American wounded were loaded onto wagons and carried back to Fort Harrison for medical care. Most of the militia was {{released}} from duty on November 9 and returned home, {{but many of the}} long-time soldiers remained in the area a bit longer. In his initial report to Secretary William Eustis, Harrison informed him of a battle having occurred near the Tippecanoe River, giving the battle the river's name; he added that he feared an imminent reprisal. The first dispatch did not make clear which side had won the conflict, and the secretary interpreted it as a defeat. The follow-up dispatch made the United States victory clear, and the defeat of Tecumseh's confederacy became more certain when no second attack occurred. Eustis replied with a lengthy note demanding to know why Harrison had not taken adequate precautions in fortifying his camp. Harrison replied that he had considered the position strong <b>enough</b> <b>without</b> fortification. This dispute was the catalyst of a disagreement between Harrison and the Department of War; as a result, he resigned from the army in 1814.|$|E

[...] While the Leafs {{would go to the}} finals every year except for 1934 and 1937 during Irvin's nine-year tenure, they were unable to win another Cup. By 1940, Smythe believed that Irvin had taken the Leafs as far as he could, and decided to replace him with former Leafs captain Hap Day, who had retired. Smythe also knew that he would be away in the war and felt that Irvin would not be tough <b>enough</b> <b>without</b> Smythe to back him up. Meanwhile, the Montreal Canadiens had had a ten-win season, and were looking for a new coach. At the suggestion of Smythe, Irvin became the new coach of the Canadiens.|$|E

The [...] "Gravity Compensation Machine" [...] has also been damaged in the fighting, causing the airship to lose altitude. Crossing the English coast, it crashes into an interception mast at a missile base in Dover.

500|$|Pound taught Hemingway {{to write}} sparingly. Pound wrote {{to him that}} [...] "anything put {{on top of the}} subject is BAD... The subject is always {{interesting}} <b>enough</b> <b>without</b> blankets." [...] Hemingway would write in A Moveable Feast (published posthumously in 1964), [...] "If I started to write elaborately, like someone presenting or introducing something, I found that I could cut that scrollwork or ornament out and throw it away and start with the first true simple declarative sentence I had written." [...] In Our Time was written during the author's experimentation phase, his first attempts towards a minimalist style. The prose in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] and [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] is sharper and more abstract than in other stories, and by employing simple sentences and diction– techniques he learned writing for newspapers– the prose is timeless with an almost mythic quality, explains Benson. The tightly compressed sentence structure emulates and reflects Pound's imagist style, bringing to prose narrative the stripped-down style Pound famously established in 1913 with poems such as [...] "In a Station of the Metro". Thomas Strychacz compares Hemingway's prose to Pound's poetry, writing, [...] "Hemingway's terse, tight-lipped, tightly wound fragments are equally extraordinary in their dramatic intensity." ...|$|E

500|$|Pfeiffer likened {{preparing}} {{herself for}} the role to a musician preparing to record an album, describing the process as twice as much work. At one point, she confessed to Kloves that {{she felt she was}} performing terribly; Kloves insisted that Pfeiffer is a poignant and insightful perfectionist. Producer Mark Rosenberg appreciated Pfeiffer for portraying Susie as a character who is [...] "so colorful and full of life that even Jack... has to perk up and pay attention". Pfeiffer decided to play her character in a way that ultimately uncovers [...] "the scared kid inside" [...] despite her profane and world-weary introduction. Although Pfeiffer was ultimately pleased with her singing, she sometimes doubted her own abilities while filming in fear that she might have [...] "outdone" [...] herself. Pfeiffer slightly slurred her speech to portray her character. Pfeiffer identified Susie's first scene, in which she walks into her audition demanding attention, as her most difficult to film because she initially struggled to channel her character's outgoing personality, which is different than her own introverted nature. A scene originally intended for the film in which Pfeiffer's character accidentally allows a bath she has begun pouring herself to overflow because she has become distracted thinking about Jack was ultimately edited out of the final film. Pfeiffer initially had reservations about performing atop a grand piano, fearing that it would appear [...] "silly" [...] and cause audience members to laugh. However, Kloves encouraged her to commit to the scene. Pfeiffer's short evening dress worn during the musical sequence was designed to be revealing <b>enough</b> <b>without</b> exposing Pfeiffer while she moves, which was choreographed by dancer Peggy Holmes. Pfeiffer touted her character [...] "one of the most alive characters that I've played", describing her as an [...] "emotional creature" [...] who is [...] "not afraid to take risks... doesn't lie to herself. If she makes a mistake, she doesn't blame anybody else. There's a purity in her honesty that I really respect", becoming a strong role model for the actress herself. Pfeiffer also credits Susie with helping her discover her own sexuality, prior to which she had felt uncomfortable exploring. According to the Orlando Sentinels Kathy Huffhines, Susie [...] "has a harder shell, a sharper edge, and a franker sexiness" [...] than previous characters Pfeiffer has played. According to film critic David Thomson of The Independent, the role of Susie allowed Pfeiffer to add an aspect to her filmography, prior to which had been [...] "dutiful" [...] yet [...] "routine".|$|E

He compares the popular {{knowledge}} of the world in Thomas Aquinas's time to what we now know about the world. He uses the example of Laplace—"It works well <b>enough</b> <b>without</b> that [...] hypothesis"—to demonstrate that we do not need God to explain things; he claims that religion becomes obsolete as an explanation when it becomes optional or one among many different beliefs. He concludes that the leap of faith is not just one leap; it is a leap repeatedly made, and a leap that becomes more difficult to take the more it is taken: which is why so many religionists now feel the need to move beyond mere faith and cite evidence for their beliefs.|$|E

2500|$|The case is {{at least}} possible, of a nation, having for centuries acknowledged, as an {{essential}} part of its theory of government, that, as a Christian nation, she is also a part of Christ's Church, and bound, in all her legislation and policy, by the fundamental rules of that Church—the case is, I say, conceivable, of a government and people, so constituted, deliberately throwing off the restraint, which in many respects such a principle would impose on them, nay, disavowing the principle itself; and that, on the plea, that other states, as flourishing or more so in regard of wealth and dominion, do well <b>enough</b> <b>without</b> it.

Unbiased opinion may have given the verdict against her last season when new arrivals set a very hot pace; but Evil Under the Sun will take a lot of beating now". After summarising the plot, the Mr. Disher concluded: [...] "Miss Christie casts the shadow of guilt upon first one and then another with such casual ease that it is difficult for the reader not to be led by the nose. Everybody is well aware that any character most strongly indicated is not a likely criminal; yet this guiding principle is forgotten when Miss Christie persuades you that you are more discerning than you really are. Then she springs her secret like a land-mine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barely {{noted in}} Spain until the Civil War, also {{afterwards}} Don Javier remained a little known figure, partially {{the result of}} censorship; Franco considered him a foreign prince. Among European royals he was respected but politically isolated. In the Carlist realm he grew from obscurity to iconic status, yet since the late 1950s he was being abandoned by successive groups, disappointed with his policy. Disintegration of Carlism accelerated after Don Javier’s death; Partido Carlista won no seats in general elections and in 1979 Carlos Hugo abandoned politics. This was also the case of his 3 sisters, though Marie Therese became a scholar in political sciences and advisor to Third World politicians. Sixte is heading , one of two Traditionalist grouplets in Spain, and poses as a Carlist standard-bearer.
