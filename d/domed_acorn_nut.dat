50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>acorn</b> <b>nuts.</b> One is low, or the {{standard}} <b>acorn</b> <b>nut.</b> The other is the high <b>acorn</b> <b>nut.</b> The high <b>acorn</b> <b>nut</b> is wider and higher and will protect extra long studs. There are also self-locking <b>acorn</b> <b>nuts</b> that have distorted threads in the hex area to create a tight friction fit to prevent the nut from vibrating loose.|$|R
50|$|There are {{standards}} {{governing the}} manufacture of <b>acorn</b> <b>nuts.</b> One is Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Standard J483, High and Low Crown (Blind, <b>Acorn)</b> Hex <b>Nuts.</b> Another is Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN) 1587, Hexagon Domed Cap Nuts.|$|R

50|$|The <b>acorn</b> <b>nut</b> {{is a type}} of {{fastener}} {{which gets}} its name from its shape. <b>Acorn</b> <b>nut</b> is its common name and it is also called a crown hex nut, blind nut, cap nut or domed cap nut. It is a nut that has a domed top to cover the threads. This is to prevent contact with the external thread to protect the threads or protect other things the threads would rub against. In addition the dome gives a more finished appearance. It is usually made of brass, steel, stainless steel (low carbon content) or nylon. It can also be chrome plated and given a mirror finish.|$|R

50|$|Wild turkeys are omnivorous, {{foraging}} on {{the ground}} or climbing shrubs and small trees to feed. They prefer eating <b>acorns,</b> <b>nuts</b> and other hard mast of various trees, including hazel, chestnut, hickory, and pinyon pine as well as various seeds, berries such as juniper and bearberry, roots and insects. Turkeys also occasionally consume amphibians and small reptiles such as lizards and snakes. Poults have been observed eating insects, berries, and seeds. Wild turkeys often feed in cow pastures, sometimes visit back yard bird feeders, and favor croplands after harvest to scavenge seeds {{on the ground}}. Turkeys are also known to eat a wide variety of grasses.|$|R

50|$|While woodrats forage on many {{different}} food items, they are they are largely depended on cached <b>acorns</b> and <b>nuts</b> during winter. Eruptions of the gypsy moth {{in the basin}} of the Lower Mississippi River in 1964 and 1965 resulted in poor acorn and chestnut crops and subsequently in increased mortality in eastern woodrats in the area.|$|R
50|$|The rock {{squirrel}} {{is predominantly}} a herbivore, eating mostly leaves, stems, and seeds. They also eat <b>acorns,</b> pine <b>nuts,</b> and fruits of native plants, including cacti. The rock squirrel forages for its food {{on a daily}} basis, by climbing trees and bushes and finding on the ground. These foraging trips are generally short-lived, usually only lasting approximately 12 minutes.|$|R
60|$|It remains, then, only to {{show how}} the seed is transported from where it grows, to where it is planted. This is done chiefly by the agency of the wind, water, and animals. The lighter seeds, as those of pines and maples, are transported chiefly by wind and water; the heavier, as <b>acorns</b> and <b>nuts,</b> by animals.|$|R
50|$|The first Picayunes were {{agents of}} their environment. They adapted {{themselves}} to a natural world that produced consistent harvests through the manipulation of sophisticated techniques such as farming, hunting, fishing, and gathering. Although deer and antelope were their primary source of protein, they also hunted for squirrel, rabbit, raccoons, and anything within the marshes and grasslands of their home. They would use decoys to capture or kill animals. According to Joana Blume, such decoys included the use of antlers and skin from previous kills to attract antelope. Other decoys helped catch pigeons. Blume also states that they would participate in communal drives; {{several members of the}} tribes would drive rabbits into nets. Sources of nutrition were also derived from plants that peaked in the summer: <b>acorns,</b> <b>nuts,</b> seeds, roots, and berries; these sources were gathered and reaped by certain members of the tribal communities.|$|R

40|$|The scrub (or California) jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) is {{distinguished}} by its crestless head, olive-gray back, and white throat, outlined in blue. Scrub jays {{are found in}} the western United States, parts of Mexico, and in central Florida. Scrub jays commonly inhabit the oak and brush-covered foothills of the mountains, timbered canyons, river bottoms, oak-lined sloughs and creeks, as well as the shade trees and dense shrubbery of residential areas. Beal (1910) reported that the diet of the scrub jay consisted of 73 % plant and 27 % animal matter. The plant matter was about one-third fruits and berries, and two-thirds <b>acorns,</b> <b>nuts,</b> and grain. Nests are usually found on brush-covered hillsides or in creek bottoms in low bushes, shrubs, and trees. Jays are omnivorous and therefore may damage several agricultural crops such as nuts, fruits, grains, peas, corn, and berries. Scrub jays are classified as migratory nongame birds in the Code of Federal Regulations...|$|R
5000|$|The 955 is one {{of about}} a dozen types of [...] "acorn valve", so called because their size and shape is similar to the <b>acorn</b> (<b>nut</b> of the oak tree), {{designed}} to work in the VHF range. The 954 and 956 types are sharp and remote cut-off pentodes, respectively, all with indirect 6.3 V, 150 mA heaters. Types 957, 958 and 959 are for portable equipment and have 1.25 V NiCd battery heaters. The 957 is a medium-μ signal triode, the 958 is a transmitting triode with dual, paralleled filaments for increased emission, and the 959 is a sharp cut-off pentode like the 954. The 957 and 959 draw 50 mA heater current, the 958 twice as much. In 1942, the 958A with tightened emission specs was introduced after it turned out that 958s with excessively high emission kept working after the filament power was turned off, the filament still sufficiently heating on the anode current alone.|$|R

50|$|Wildlife {{uses the}} silver maple in various ways. In {{many parts of}} the eastern U.S., the large rounded buds are one of the primary food sources for {{squirrels}} during the spring, after many <b>acorns</b> and <b>nuts</b> have sprouted and the squirrels' food is scarce. The seeds are also a food source for squirrels, chipmunks and birds. The bark can be eaten by beaver and deer. The trunks tend to produce cavities, which can shelter squirrels, raccoons, opossums, owls and woodpeckers.|$|R

50|$|Chinkapin oak is {{monoecious}} in flowering habit; flowers {{emerge in}} April to late May or early June. The staminate flowers are borne in catkins that develop from the leaf axils {{of the previous}} year, and the pistillate flowers develop from the axils of the current year's leaves. The fruit, an <b>acorn</b> or <b>nut,</b> is borne singly or in pairs, matures in 1 year, and ripens in September or October. About half of the acorn is enclosed in a thin cup and is chestnut brown to nearly black.|$|R
50|$|Aboriginal Paipai {{subsistence}} {{was based}} on hunting and gathering of natural animal and plants rather than on agriculture. Numerous plants were exploited as food resources, notably including agave, yucca, mesquite, prickly pear, <b>acorns,</b> pine <b>nuts,</b> and juniper berries. Many other plants served as medicine or as material for construction or craft products. Animals used for food included deer, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, rabbits, woodrats, various other medium and small mammals, quail, fish, and shellfish. Crop growing and stock raising were introduced during the historic period.|$|R
