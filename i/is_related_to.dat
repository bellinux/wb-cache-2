5|$|As Emmanuil Gushansky states, today {{subjective}} {{position of}} a Russian patient toward a medical psychologist and psychiatrist is defensive in nature and prevents the attempt to understand the patient and help him assess his condition. Such a position <b>is</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> constant, subconscious fear of psychiatrists and psychiatry. This fear is caused by not only abuse of psychiatry, but also constant violence in the totalitarian and post-totalitarian society. The psychiatric violence and psychiatric arrogance as one of manifestations of such violence <b>is</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the primary emphasis on symptomatology and biological causes of a disease, while ignoring psychological, existential, and psychodynamic factors. Gushainsky notices that the modern Russian psychiatry {{and the structure of}} providing mental health care are aimed not at protecting the patient's right to an own place in life, but at discrediting such a right, revealing symptoms and isolating the patient.|$|E

500|$|Rejewski studied these related {{pairs of}} letters. For example, {{if there were}} four {{messages}} that had the following indicators on the same day: BJGTDN, LIFBAB, ETULZR, TFREII, then {{by looking at the}} first and fourth letters of each set, he knew that certain pairs of letters <b>were</b> <b>related.</b> B <b>was</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> T, L <b>was</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> B, E <b>was</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> L, and T <b>was</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> E: (B,T), (L,B), (E,L), and (T,E). If he had enough different messages to work with, he could build entire sequences of relationships: the letter B <b>was</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> T, which <b>was</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> E, which <b>was</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> L, which <b>was</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> B (see diagram). This was a [...] "cycle of 4", since it took four jumps until it got back to the start letter. Another cycle on the same day might be AFWA, or a [...] "cycle of 3". If there were enough messages on a given day, all the letters of the alphabet might be covered by a number of different cycles of various sizes. The cycles would be consistent for one day, and then would change to a different set of cycles the next day. Similar analysis could be done on the 2nd and 5th letters, and the 3rd and 6th, identifying the cycles in each case and the number of steps in each cycle.|$|R
