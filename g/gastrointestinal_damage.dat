25|$|Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea, {{abdominal}} cramps, and constipation {{are common}} side-effects of chemotherapeutic medications that kill fast-dividing cells. Malnutrition and dehydration can result {{when the patient}} does not eat or drink enough, or when the patient vomits frequently, because of <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>damage.</b> This can result in rapid weight loss, or occasionally in weight gain, if the patient eats too much {{in an effort to}} allay nausea or heartburn. Weight gain can also be caused by some steroid medications. These side-effects can frequently be reduced or eliminated with antiemetic drugs. Self-care measures, such as eating frequent small meals and drinking clear liquids or ginger tea, are often recommended. In general, this is a temporary effect, and frequently resolves within a week of finishing treatment. However, a high index of suspicion is appropriate, since diarrhea and bloating are also symptoms of typhlitis, a very serious and potentially life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate treatment.|$|E

After 1 h, naproxen (80 mg/kg, p. o.) was administered. The rats were killed on day two, 4 h after naproxen treatment. The stomachs were promptly excised, opened along the greater curvature, and measured using digital calipers. Furthermore, the guts of the animals were removed, and a 5 -cm portion of the small intestine (jejunum and ileum) was used for the evaluation of macroscopic scores. Samples of the stomach and the small intestine were used for histological evaluation, morphometric analysis and in assays for glutathione (GSH) levels, malonyldialdehyde (MDA) concentration, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. PLS treatment reduced the macroscopic and microscopic naproxen-induced <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>damage</b> in a dose-dependent manner.

The initial aim was to gain listing of misoprostol on the Australian National Formulary. Design: The economic evaluation followed a 2 -stage approach in considering the cost effectiveness of misoprostol, a Setting: Three different populations were considered: the total trial population; patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease; and patients over 65 years of age. Study population: Patient data were taken from the MUCOSA trial, which involved 8843 patients receiving continuous NSAID therapy for the control of rheumatoid arthritis. Interventions: Misoprostol plus any NSAID therapy was compared with placebo (no misoprostol) plus any NSAID therapy. Main outcome measures and results: The study found the incremental cost per definite serious gastrointestinal complication avoided with misoprostol was 39 603 Australian dollars ($A) for the total trial population, $A 5599 for patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease and $A 35 405 for patients over 65 years of age. The incremental cost per life-year saved with misoprostol was $A 41 866 for the whole group, $A 6244 for patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease and $A 40 322 for patients over 65 years of age.

Furthermore to study the pharmacodynamic interactions between antibiotics and antineoplastic drugs and the impact of antineoplastic drugs on the intestinal microflora. Methods: Kinetic data were obtained by model-independent methods for the beta-lactam antibiotics and by population-based methods for co-trimoxazole. Bacterial killing curves and postantibiotic effects (PAE) of different antibiotics alone and in combination with antineoplastic drugs were studied in vitro. Faecal samples were obtained from patients with acute leukaemia on different cytostatic regimens before, during and after treatment and were cultured quantitatively and qualitatively. Results and Discussion: The faster elimination of meropenem and ceftazidime in our patients compared to historical controls results in shorter times above MIC for the most common pathogens. A dose interval of 6 h seems safer than the commonly used 8 h interval, since serum concentrations should stay above MIC for most of a dose interval in these immunocompromised patients. No correlation was found between the degree of cytostatic-induced <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>damage</b> and the bioavailability of co-trimoxazole, indicating that the dose of co-trimoxazole needs not be adjusted in these patients. Antibacterial effect and PAEs of the combinations of antibiotics and antineoplastic drugs did not differ markedly from the effects of the antibiotics alone. In the presence of 5 -FU and doxorubicin, the antibacterial effect of tobramycin was increased against S. aureus. The PAEs of meropenem and ciprofloxacin against S. epidermidis were synergistically prolonged by 5 -FU. This might be due to inhibition of slime production in these strains by 5 -FU.
