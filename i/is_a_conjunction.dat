At one time, some {{scientists}} hypothesized {{that there may be a}} planet (often given the name Vulcan) even closer to the Sun than Mercury; the only way to confirm its existence would have been to observe it in transit or during a total solar eclipse. No such planet was ever found, and general relativity has since explained the observations that led astronomers to suggest that Vulcan might exist.|$|E

The commonly accepted theory among historians is that the modern-day Tijuana is derived from a word belong to the Kumeyaay language – the original aboriginal inhabitants of the San Diego-Tijuana region. Tijuana derives from the Kumeyaay word Tiwan, meaning by-the-sea. Common in regional folklore, a myth exists purporting that the name <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>conjunction</b> of Tia Juana, the Spanish-language version of Aunt Jane. Tia Juana would provide food and a resting place to travelers on their journeys. The story has become a popular myth with residents {{of the city and}} has particular resonance among those who like to imagine the city as a place of hospitality.|$|E
25|$|The {{state is}} divided into five {{geographical}} regions: The Sierra Gorda, El Semidesierto Queretano, Los Valles Centrales, El Bajío Queretano and La Sierra Queretana. The Sierra Gorda {{is located in the}} north of the state and is part of the Sierra Madre Oriental, specifically in a subprovince called the Huasteco Karst. It is found in the municipalities of Arroyo Seco, Jalpan de Serra, Landa de Matamoros, Pinal de Amoles and San Joaquín and covers an area of 3,789km2 or 32.2% of the state. The topography is rugged, with high elevations and steep valleys. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>conjunction</b> of mountains and hills formed mostly by limestone, with wide contrasts in climates and vegetation. They range from near desert conditions to forests of pine and holm oak to the tropical rainforests of the Huasteca area in the state of San Luis Potosí. The Sierra Gorda was made a biosphere reserve in 1997, the Reserva de la Biosfera de la Sierra Gorda, to protect its abundance of species and ecosystems. In 2001, the area was registered with the Man and the Biosphere Programme of UNESCO. This area is managed by la Comisión Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas of the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources federal agency.|$|E

500|$|A 2-satisfiability {{problem may}} be {{described}} using a Boolean expression with a special restricted form. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>conjunction</b> (a Boolean and operation) of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (a Boolean or operation) of two variables or negated variables. The variables or their negations appearing in this formula are known as literals. For example, the following formula is in conjunctive normal form, with seven variables, eleven clauses, and 22 literals: ...|$|E
2500|$|Rules, {{and even}} {{disjunctive}} rules, have a rather special syntactic form, {{in comparison with}} arbitrary propositional formulas. Each disjunctive rule is essentially an implication such that its antecedent (the body of the rule) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>conjunction</b> of literals, and its consequent (head) is a disjunction of atoms. David Pearce [...] and Paolo Ferraris [...] showed how to extend {{the definition of a}} stable model to sets of arbitrary propositional formulas. This generalization has applications to answer set programming.|$|E
2500|$|A comma (or a colon, {{semicolon}} etc.) {{should be}} placed at the border of clauses {{whether or not there}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>conjunction.</b> It also applies to cases when the clause begins with one of the conjunctions és, s, meg ‘and’ and vagy ‘or’. However, it is sometimes difficult to assess whether the part joined with these conjunctions is a separate clause (because if it is not, no comma is needed). For example: Bevágta az ajtót, és dühösen elrohant. ‘He banged the door and rushed away in fury.’ but Hirtelen felugrott és elrohant. ‘He suddenly jumped up and rushed away.’ ...|$|E

2500|$|Much of the {{discussion}} of the paradox in general and the Bayesian approach in particular has centred on the relevance of background knowledge. Surprisingly, Maher shows that, for a large class of possible configurations of background knowledge, the observation of a non-black non-raven provides exactly the same amount of confirmation as the observation of a black raven. The configurations of background knowledge that he considers are those that are provided by a sample proposition, namely a proposition that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>conjunction</b> of atomic propositions, each of which ascribes a single predicate to a single individual, with no two atomic propositions involving the same individual. Thus, a proposition of the form [...] "A is a black raven and B is a white shoe" [...] can be considered a sample proposition by taking [...] "black raven" [...] and [...] "white shoe" [...] to be predicates.|$|E

"Others," [...] as Mr. Skryme is {{accustomed}} to say, [...] "may go star-gazing, and look for conjunctions in the heavens, but here <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>conjunction</b> on the earth, near at home and under our own eyes, which surpasses all the signs and calculations of astrologers." [...] Since these portentous weathercocks have thus laid their heads together, wonderful events had already occurred. The good old king, notwithstanding that he had lived eighty-two years, had all at once given up the ghost; another king had mounted the throne; a royal duke had died suddenly; another, in France, had been murdered; there had been radical meetings {{in all parts of}} the kingdom; the bloody scenes at Manchester; the great plot in Cato Street; and, above all, the queen had returned to England! All these sinister events are recounted by Mr. Skyrme with a mysterious look and a dismal shake of the head; and being taken with his drugs, and associated in the minds of his auditors with stuffed-sea-monsters, bottled serpents, and his own visage, which is a title-page of tribulation, they have spread great gloom through the minds of the people of Little Britain. They shake their heads whenever they go by Bow Church, and observe that they never expected any good to come of taking down that steeple, which in old times told nothing but glad tidings, as the history of Whittington and his Cat bears witness.|$|E
6000|$|In our day, {{it is said}} despairingly, the {{understanding}} reigns triumphant: it is the age of common sense. If this be so, the wisest way would be to accept it manfully. But, after all, {{what is the meaning}} of it? Looking at the matter superficially, one would say that a striking difference between our science and that of the world's gray fathers is that there is every day less and less of the element of wonder in it. What they saw written in light upon the great arch of heaven, and, by a magnificent reach of sympathy, of which we are incapable, associated with the fall of monarchs and the fate of man, is for us only a professor, a piece of chalk, and a blackboard. The solemn and unapproachable skies we have vulgarized; we have peeped and botanized among the flowers of light, pulled off every petal, fumbled in every calyx, and reduced them to the bare stem of order and class. The stars can no longer maintain their divine reserves, but whenever there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>conjunction</b> and congress of planets, every enterprising newspaper sends thither its special reporter with his telescope. Over those arcana of life where once a mysterious presence brooded, we behold scientific explorers skipping like so many incarnate notes of interrogation. We pry into the counsels of the great powers of nature, we keep our ears at the keyhole, and know everything that is going to happen. There is no longer any sacred inaccessibility, no longer any enchanting unexpectedness, and life turns to prose the moment there is nothing unattainable. It needs no more a voice out of the unknown proclaiming [...] "Great Pan is dead!" [...] We have found his tombstone, deciphered the arrow-headed inscription upon it, know his age to a day, and that he died universally regretted.|$|E

Thus, then, at {{the close}} of the fifth century, you have Europe divided simply by her watershed; and two Christian kings reigning, with entirely beneficent and healthy power--one in the north--one in the south--the mightiest and worthiest of them married to the other's {{youngest}} sister: a saint queen in the north--and a devoted and earnest Catholic woman, queen mother in the south. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>conjunction</b> of things memorable enough in the Earth's history,--much to be thought of, O fast whirling reader, if ever, out of the crowd of pent up cattle driven across Rhine, or Adige, you can extricate yourself for an hour, to walk peacefully out of the south gate of Cologne, or across Fra Giocondo's bridge at Verona--and so pausing look through the clear air across the battlefield of Tolbiac to the blue Drachenfels, or across the plain of St. Ambrogio to the mountains of Garda. For there were fought--if you will think closely--the two victor-battles of the Christian world. Constantine's only gave changed form and dying colour to the falling walls of Rome; but the Frank and Gothic races, thus conquering and thus ruled, founded the arts and established the laws which gave to all future Europe her joy, and her virtue. And it is lovely to see how, even thus early, the Feudal chivalry depended for its life on the nobleness of its womanhood. There was no vision seen, or alleged, at Tolbiac. The King prayed simply to the God of Clotilde. On the morning of the battle of Verona, Theodoric visited the tent of his mother and his sister, [...] "and requested that on the most illustrious festival of his life, they would adorn him with the rich garments which they had worked with their own hands." ...|$|E
