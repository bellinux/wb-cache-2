40|$|We {{have made}} the first {{measurement}} of defects in an aged sample of {delta} phase, Ga stabilized Pu, using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. This measurement validates the procedure necessary to perform measurements on this <b>highly</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>material</b> and obtain data representative of sample conditions. Comparison of the positron annihilation lifetime {{analysis of the data}} with calculated values suggests that He filled vacancies or vacancy clusters dominate the defect population. Such defects are the necessary precursor to void growth and swelling. The evolution of defects resulting from the radioactive decay of Pu during its life in the stockpile is one of the unknown quantities affecting our confidence in predictions of the limit on stockpile components. Radiation damage leads to changes in the size and strength of metals studied for reactor and accelerator use and similar effects may be expected in Pu. The evolution of radiation produced vacancies into larger void structures and accompanying macroscopic swelling may occur in Pu at some age. A detailed understanding of the defects in self irradiated Pu is required to predict the time scale of void swelling and related radiation effects. 1 fig...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of plasma-facing walls in future nuclear fusion devices, a {{knowledge}} of the reaction mechanisms and properties of these materials is essential for operation and safety. The aim of the studies for this thesis was to investigate the effect of implanting ke V deuterium ions in various mixed and pure materials. To do so required an adaptation of the existing ultra-high vacuum experiment Artoss; the modified version of this apparatus allowed the detection of hydrogen isotopes, besides having an updated vacuum system where vacuum conditions with base pressures of less than 3 x 10 - 9 Pa were achieved. Using Artoss and another ultra-high vacuum device (XPS), clean samples of crystalline beryllium, highly-oriented pyrolytic graphite, and mixed materials consisting of beryllium and titanium substrates with carbon surface layers of less than 10 nm thickness were bombarded with 1 and 4 ke V deuterium ions. Deuterium retention in clean metallic beryllium was found to saturate at 2 x 1015 /cm 2; beryllium samples prepared with carbon surface layers displayed higher hydrogen isotope retention. In addition to eroding the carbon surface layer, the deuterium ions carry the energy to modity the carbon surtace layer, creatmg metallIc carbIde phases. Carbon in its elementary form was found to erode at a significantly greater rate than carbon in the metallic carbide phases. The erosion behaviour of titanium carbide is in good agreement with computer simulations of a kinematic sputtering model, whereas the exponential erosion rate of elementary carbon suggests that chemical interactions play an additional important role. These findings suggest that beryllium, despite being a <b>highly</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>material,</b> is well suited as a first-wall material in future fusion devices, provided a high-quality vacuum can be consistently achieved...|$|E

40|$|Sugar {{industry}} {{is one of}} the most important agro based industries in India and is highly responsible for creating significant impact on rural economy in particular and countries economy in general. Sugar industries rank second amongst mavar agro based industries in India. Sugar {{industry is}} seasonal in nature and operates only for 120 to 200 days in a year (early November to April). A significant large amount of waste is generated during the manufacture of sugar and contains a high amount of production load particularly in items of suspended solids, organic matters, press-mud, and bagasses and air pollution. (Bevan, 1971, Hendrickson et. al. 1971).

30|$|The {{last decade}} has seen {{remarkable}} {{growth in the}} Indian economy due to economic liberalization started in early nineties. Also, during the post liberalization era, electronics industry is growing very fast in India. Due {{to the presence of}} global electronics companies and tremendous expansion of telecommunication, and information technology, Indian markets are flooded with electronics goods. This results in a new kind of waste known as electronics waste or e-waste. E-waste contains both <b>toxic</b> and valuable <b>materials.</b> The fraction including iron, copper, aluminium, gold and other metals in e-waste is over 60  %, while plastics account for about 30  % and the hazardous pollutants comprise only about 2.70  % (Widmer et al. 2005). This large percentage of valuable materials offers a business opportunity to recover value from the e-waste. It may be even profitable to collect and process e-waste. The hazardous pollutants though small in quantity but contain <b>highly</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>materials</b> like lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, chromium and many more. When these materials enter into the environment through land filling, causes damage to {{human health and the environment}} (Lee et al. 2000). E-waste can be well managed through development of RL system. Cheng and Lee (2010) found that effective RL focuses on the backward flow of materials to maximize value from returned items and guarantee their proper disposal. However, many companies are not yet ready to implement RL including Indian companies. Indian electronics industry has been selected for the study because it has a high consumption volume, and major source of e-waste generation. Also, this is one of the few sectors which come under e-waste regulations. A thorough study of CSFs and their ordered implementation is essential for successful RL implementation. Most of the researches on the CSFs of RL implementation are concentrated on developed countries, with relatively little attention being given to developing countries (Abdulrahman et al. 2014). The major intention of this study is to understand various CSFs for RL implementation in Indian electronics industry. The identification and prioritization of these factors will help the researchers and the managers in strategic decision making for RL implementation. After review of literature on RL and the opinion of experts from Indian electronics industry, 12 CSFs factors of RL implementation were identified. The experts were asked to rate each of these 12 factors in terms of their importance. A decision matrix was developed from these responses which are used in the application of fuzzy-TOPSIS methodology for prioritizing CSFs.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Direct pulp capping {{involves}} {{placing a}} material over the exposed pulp {{in order to}} maintain its vitality. For decades, calcium hydroxide (CH) has served as the gold standard for this purpose, but its toxicity to the pulp may negatively impact treatment outcomes. Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) has become a popular alternative based partly on its excellent biocompatibility. Pulp-capped teeth are often restored with <b>highly</b> <b>toxic</b> composite <b>materials,</b> but the pulp capping material’s ability to alter these toxic effects has never been investigated. The purpose of this in vitro study is {{to determine the effects of}} Dycal, a CH-based cement, and ProRoot MTA on the toxicities of two popular restorative composites, Flow Line and Durafill VS. Materials and Methods: Human dental pulp cells were cultured and exposed to Dycal or MTA for 48 hours. Dycal and MTA were then removed and either Flow Line or Durafill VS was added to cell cultures for 24 hours. Toxicity was determined using the LDH release assay before and after the addition of the composite material. Results: Dycal demonstrated a high level of toxicity that correlated with the amount of material placed in cell culture. MTA was nontoxic even in amounts at which Dycal was <b>highly</b> <b>toxic.</b> Exposure of pulp cells to Dycal resulted in decreased toxicity of Durafill VS and had no effect on Flow Line toxicity. MTA exposure resulted in enhanced Flow Line toxicity and had no effect on the toxicity of Durafill VS. Conclusions: These results show that calcium hydroxide and MTA are capable of altering the toxicity of composite restorative materials. MTA may enhance the toxicity of some composites, while Dycal may have an inhibitory effect. More studies are needed to determine the clinical significance of these effects...|$|R

As a result, researchers are working on developing alternate dots made out of a different, less <b>toxic</b> <b>material</b> while still retaining some of the fluorescence properties. In particular, they have been investigating the particular benefits of zinc sulfide quantum dots which, though they are not quite as fluorescent as cadmium selenide, can be augmented with other metals including manganese and various lanthanide elements. In addition, these newer quantum dots become more fluorescent when they bond to their target cells.|$|R
40|$|Programmatic {{operations}} at the Los Alamos National Laboratory Plutonium Facility (T A- 55) involve working with various amounts of plutonium and other <b>highly</b> <b>toxic,</b> alpha-emitting <b>materials.</b> The spread of radiological contamination on surfaces, airborne contamination, and excursions of contaminants into the operator's breathing zone are prevented {{through the use of}} a variety of gloveboxes. Using an integrated approach, controls have been developed and implemented through an efficient Glovebox Glove Integrity Program. A key element of this program is to consider measures that lower the overall risk of glovebox operations. Line management who own glovebox processes through this program make decisions on which type of glovebox gloves (hereafter referred to as gloves), the weakest component of this safety-significant system, would perform best in these aggressive environments. As Low as Reasonably Achievable considerations must be balanced with glove durability and worker dexterity, both of which affect the final overall risk of the operation. In the past, lead-loaded (leaded) gloves made from Hypalon(reg.) were the primary glove for programmatic {{operations at}} TA 55. Replacing leaded gloves with unleaded gloves for certain operations would lower the overall risk as well as reduce the amount of mixed transuranic waste.

40|$|Free-machining brass {{containing}} 2 – 3 % of lead is {{a preferred}} industrial material as it shows excellent machinability where low cutting forces, short chips and reduced tool wear are attained. However this addition of lead, a <b>highly</b> <b>toxic</b> and hazardous <b>material,</b> leads {{to health and}} environmental issues. Alternative lead-free brasses are known for poor chip control and accelerated tool wear. The current study focuses on wear mechanisms of uncoated and coated cemented carbide tools when high-speed machining lead-free CuZn 21 Si 3 P silicon brass. The study shows that severe crater formation on the rake is the dominant tool failure mode. Microscopy observations indicate the diffusion wear mechanism {{to be driven by}} diffusion of cobalt binder into the chips and minor cross-diffusion of copper and zinc. Loss of the binder in cemented carbide is accompanied by adhesive pluck-out of WC grains. As a way to hinder the loss of Co, the diffusion preventing capacity of a-C:H diamond like carbon and (Ti,V,Zr,Nb,Hf,Ta) N nitride coating were tested. SEM, EDX and TEM data show that formation of amorphous SiO 2 and stoichiometric β-SiAlON stable layers was observed on the nitride coating, thus preventing diffusional tool wear. O-rich and N-rich glassy amorphous layers in Si-Al-O-N system with ZnS inclusions were found on the DLC coating.
