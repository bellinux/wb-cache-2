30|$|At least 70 {{fish species}} were {{observed}} in the seagrass beds during the study periods. Fish density and diversity increased with increasing depths, as well as during <b>flood</b> <b>tides.</b> The intertidal areas were characterized by more variation in both fish assemblage and trophic structure than the subtidal areas. A cluster analysis identified six principal feeding groups and invertebrate-feeding carnivores contributed about 70 % of the total fish abundance.

40|$|Approximately 5300 fish larvae, {{representing}} 59 {{species and}} 39 families, {{were collected in}} <b>flood</b> and ebb <b>tide</b> samples taken by plankton and beach seine nets in the narrow entrance channel of a seasonally open estuary (Wilson Inlet), in the {{two to three months}} before the mouth became closed by a sand bar. All of the species were recorded on <b>flood</b> <b>tides</b> and eight of the nine that were also found in ebb tides were spawned within the estuary. The other 51 species belonged to teleosts which typically breed at sea. The most abundant species caught during this study (Favonigobius lateralis) was flushed out of the estuary as preflexion larvae on ebb tides and then re-recruited as postflexion larvae on <b>flood</b> <b>tides.</b> While other species which spawn within the estuary (e. g. Pseudogobius olorum, Engraulis australis and Urocampus carinirostris) were also flushed out on ebb tides, they rarely returned on <b>flood</b> <b>tides</b> as postflexion larvae. Of the 51 marine species, 35 were not collected as either juveniles or adults within the estuary. These species were caught only on <b>flood</b> <b>tides</b> and mainly as preflexion larvae. In contrast, the sparids Pagrus auratus and Rhabdosargus sarba, which occur as juveniles in the estuary, were found entering the entrance channel on <b>flood</b> <b>tides</b> as postflexion larvae. The fact that the last two species are amongst the few teleosts that might be recruited as larvae into {{the main body of the}} estuary, reflects the very small tidal movement in that part of the system...|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} and abundance of Rhinoceros Auklets {{is related to}} the tide cycle.

Low abundance during the ebbing tide was attributed to high prey concentrations in the south end of the pass outside of the survey area. Auklets strongly preferred the center of the pass, where the main current flowed, over the calmer water closer to shore. This study shows the importance of the tide cycle in influencing the daily movements of Rhinoceros Auklets...|$|R
25|$|Because the M2 tidal {{constituent}} dominates in most locations, {{the stage}} or {{phase of a}} tide, denoted by the time in hours after high water, is a useful concept. Tidal stage is also measured in degrees, with 360° per tidal cycle. Lines of constant tidal phase are called cotidal lines, which are analogous to contour lines of constant altitude on topographical maps. High water is reached simultaneously along the cotidal lines extending from the coast out into the ocean, and cotidal lines (and hence tidal phases) advance along the coast. Semi-diurnal and long phase constituents are measured from high water, diurnal from maximum <b>flood</b> <b>tide.</b> This and the discussion that follows is precisely true only for a single tidal constituent.|$|E
500|$|Being {{the onset}} of the <b>flood</b> <b>tide,</b> the bore is {{accompanied}} by a rapid rise in water level which continues for about one and a half hours after the bore has passed. The Severn bore is not a self-reinforcing solitary wave or soliton but rather a shock wave which is formed because the wave is travelling faster than the wave speed in water above the bore (see tidal bore for more details). The passing of the bore causes a churning of the water, and the myriads of tiny bubbles popping contributes much of the roaring sound made by the bore. The largest recorded bore was on 15 October 1966, when it reached a height of [...] at Stonebench.|$|E

30|$|Our results {{documented}} {{differences in}} fish assemblage and trophic structure between tides in tropical seagrass beds. We consider that water depth {{may be responsible}} for these complex assemblage dynamics. Different trophic groups had distinct habitat usage patterns that were dependent upon tide-driven changes in water depth.

500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1628, there was {{flooding}} at Fishlake and Sykehouse, which was followed by rioting. A navigable sluice was built at Turnbridge in 1629, with a lock , and an outfall sluice called the [...] "Great Sluice" [...] was completed in 1630, probably by Hugo Spiering, who had assisted Vermuyden with the main project. Continued problems with flooding led {{to the construction of}} a [...] channel from Newbridge near Thorne eastwards to Goole, where water levels in the Ouse were between [...] lower than at Turnbridge. The channel, called the Dutch River, ended in another outfall sluice, and was completed in 1635 at a cost of £33,000. Boats continued to use the lock at Turnbridge. In about 1688 the Goole sluice was washed away by a flood, and was never replaced. The tidal scour widened the channel, and barges of up to 30 tonnes could normally reach Fishlake, and often Wilsick House, in Barnby Dun. Smaller boats could reach Doncaster for most of the year, and large barges could do so when there was a <b>flood</b> <b>tide.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Chiswick {{reach of}} the Thames is heavily used for {{competitive}} and recreational rowing. Championship Course from Mortlake to Putney runs past Chiswick Eyot and Duke's Meadows.

30|$|We {{documented}} distinct fish assemblages {{at different}} points in the tidal cycle around the Dongsha Island. Fish density and richness were both higher at the deeper subtidal station, as well as during <b>flood</b> <b>tides.</b> We also documented variation in the density of different trophic groups over the tidal cycle. Many trophic groups were overrepresented at greater depths, including most herbivores, large carnivores, and piscivores (Figure  4, Group A). Indeed, numerous studies have documented increases in fish densities during <b>flood</b> <b>tides</b> (Kneib and Wagner 1994; Unsworth et al. 2007 a). Generally, the deeper water can support more fish abundance by both retaining more space and serving as a more stable environment for larger sized or pelagic fish (Pogoreutz et al.|$|R

In downtown, both the Episcopal and Methodist chapels collapsed, and warehouses were moderately damaged. The town's new stone marine hospital, struck by {{the remnants of a}} wharf and a large raft, was nearly completely destroyed by the storm's intense winds. Lumber, crowbars, and cannon carriages from the construction site of Fort Zachary Taylor were scattered throughout the streets.

Several wooden buildings along the shoreline, not tethered to the ground, drifted out to sea upon high waters due to the sheer force of the hurricane's gusts. Other notable maritime losses were also noted nearby, with the deaths of three on the Lafayette, which capsized offshore, one fatality each upon the Exchange and Frankford, and 19casualties on the Villa Nueva; in addition, several other abandoned vessels were driven aground, apparently without any loss of life.|$|E

30|$|A {{minority}} of fish (Figure  4, Group B) showed {{a preference for}} shallower stations and ebb tides, including detritivorous mugilids, A. elymus, G. oyena, G. richardsonii, and small S. barracuda. The mugilids and A. elymus were found at high densities at L during ebb tides. Furthermore, we found that these two species mostly stayed near the water’s surface and seldom moved into seagrass meadows. Their decreased presence during <b>flood</b> <b>tides</b> may also be due to predator avoidance. As mentioned above, numerous piscivores migrated into the shallows during <b>flood</b> <b>tides,</b> and mugilids and A. elymus were important food sources for these predators. These fish may thus change their habitats during the early period of <b>flood</b> <b>tides</b> to avoid predators. Other surface-dwelling fish such as Fundulus heteroclitus in salt marshes (Kimball and Able 2012) and Anableps anableps in mangroves (Brenner and Krumme 2007) also alter their habitat during <b>flood</b> <b>tides.</b> Moreover, the POM on which mugilids feed is typically derived from primary producers (Blay 1995; Lin et al. 2007). The nearshore water circulation at L was relatively low in this study due to {{the distance of the}} study station from the channel (Figure  1), and detritus from seagrass and littoral plants readily accumulated (Huang 2012), providing a significant food source for these detritivorous mugilids. A. elymus and G. oyena can also feed on detritus, suggesting that these fish may have sufficient food sources in the lagoon. We also found that A. elymus fed on some terrestrial insects, meaning not all of their food comes from seagrass meadows. The fact that these surface-dwelling fish do not appear to interact with or reside within seagrass meadows may explain why their behavior differed from that of the seagrass inhabiting fish species.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mussels and oysters are {{efficient}} filter feeds that prefer living phytoplankton {{but will}} also consume detritus when the former is in low supply. Many mussel and oyster producing {{areas of the world}} rely on external sources of phytoplankton brought into bays, sounds and estuaries from larger waterbodies on <b>flood</b> <b>tides.</b> Bivalve carrying capacity is frequently defined in terms of the biomass of cultured organisms that can optimally be maintained without depleting particular organic matter {{to the point where the}} cultures are adversely affected. This approach assumes that cultured stocks are sentinels of the health of the larger ecosystem. Water samples were collected on ebb and <b>flood</b> <b>tides</b> near the mouth of Totten Inlet to assess existing demands for phytoplankton and POM as an aid to determining the inlet’s bivalve carrying capacity. The resulting data indicated that Totten Inlet was a net consumer of dissolved nutrients (NH 4 +, NO 2, NO 3 and PO 4). Chlorophyll concentrations were higher on ebb <b>tides</b> than on <b>flood</b> <b>tides</b> suggesting that the inlet was a net producer of phytoplankton, but the differences were not statistically significant. The waters of Totten Inlet contained higher concentrations of total volatile solids than any other bivalve producing area for which data was available. A comparison of mussel growth rates with chlorophyll a and TVS concentrations suggests tha...|$|R

2500|$|Turnagain extends in an east-west direction, and {{is between}} [...] long. It forms {{part of the}} {{northern}} boundary of Kenai Peninsula, and reaches on the east to within [...] of Portage Bay, a western branch of Prince William Sound. Turnagain is characterized by remarkably large tides of up to 40 feet (12 meters) which are the largest tides in the United States. The <b>flood</b> <b>tide</b> often begins with a tidal bore especially on large tides with a strong east wind, which has a height of [...] at times, and runs in from the west at a speed of [...] an hour.
