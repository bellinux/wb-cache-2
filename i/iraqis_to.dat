5|$|From the {{beginning}} the Damascus government began an overwhelmingly anti-Iraqi Ba'athist propaganda campaign, {{to which their}} counterparts in Baghdad responded. However, the Iraqi Ba'athists helped Assad, who at the 4th Regional Congress of the Syrian Regional Branch called for the reunification of the Ba'ath Party, {{in his attempt to}} seize power from Jadid. It was reported that Assad promised the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>to</b> recognize Aflaq's historical leadership. Iraq's foreign minister Abd al-Karim al-Shaykli even had his own personal office in the Syrian Ministry of Defence, which Assad headed. However, this should not be misconstrued, the Iraqi Regional Branch was Arab nationalist in name only, and was in fact Iraqi nationalist.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the Iraqi advance towards Khafji {{continued}} on this sector, despite repeated attacks from an AC-130. Attempts by the Saudi commanders {{to call in}} additional air strikes on the advancing Iraqi column failed when the requested heavy air support never arrived. Khafji was occupied by approximately 00:30 on 30 January, trapping two six-man reconnaissance teams from the 1st Marine Division in the city. The teams occupied two apartment buildings in the southern sector {{of the city and}} called artillery fire on their position to persuade the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>to</b> call off a search of the area. Throughout the night, Coalition air support composed of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft continued to engage Iraqi tanks and artillery.|$|E
25|$|On 10 August 2014, at {{approximately}} 2:15a.m. ET, the US carried out five additional airstrikes on armed vehicles and a mortar position, enabling 20,000–30,000 Yazidi <b>Iraqis</b> <b>to</b> flee into Syria and later be rescued by Kurdish forces. The Kurdish forces then provided {{shelter for the}} Yazidis in Dohuk.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{the work}} of almost 26,000 civilians on civil-works {{programs}} throughout USACE provide a training ground for similar capabilities worldwide. USACE civilians volunteer for assignments worldwide. For example, hydropower experts have helped repair, renovate, and run hydropower dams in Iraq {{in an effort to}} help get <b>Iraqis</b> <b>to</b> become self-sustaining.|$|E
25|$|Several {{sources have}} {{attributed}} {{the increase in}} the rate of birth defects in the children of Gulf War veterans and in <b>Iraqis</b> <b>to</b> depleted uranium inhalation exposure, A 2001 study of 15,000 February 1991 U.S. Gulf War combat veterans and 15,000 control veterans found that the Gulf War veterans were 1.8 (fathers) to 2.8 (mothers) {{times more likely to have}} children with birth defects.|$|E
25|$|The United States, {{which had}} urged <b>Iraqis</b> <b>to</b> rise up against Saddam, {{did nothing to}} assist the rebellions. The Iranians, despite the {{widespread}} Shi'ite rebellions, {{had no interest in}} provoking another war, while Turkey opposed any prospect of Kurdish independence, and the Saudis and other conservative Arab states feared an Iran-style Shi'ite revolution. Saddam, having survived the immediate crisis in the wake of defeat, was left firmly in control of Iraq, although the country never recovered either economically or militarily from the Gulf War.|$|E

25|$|At {{the close}} of 2007, a new Minister of Health, Saleh Al-Hasnawi, was {{appointed}} and began ministerial reforms. The Inspector General was replaced and a new openness was encouraged. In June, 2008, the Minister of Health convened a National Strategic Planning Conference in Baghdad. At this conference, attended by professionals, NGOs and Provincial Reconstruction Teams from all over Iraq, he announced that Iraq would direct its own health reconstruction, funding it with Iraqi money according to Iraqi priorities. Although {{there is still a}} place for external expert advice, the determination of the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>to</b> direct their own health development was clear.|$|E
25|$|In May 1941, {{to add to}} British {{troubles}} in the area, there was a coup d'état against the pro-British government in Iraq. A pro-German ruler took power in the coup and ordered British forces out of Iraq. There were two main British bases in Iraq, around Basra and at Habbaniya north east of Baghdad. Basra was too well defended for the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>to</b> consider taking. However, Habbaniya was a poorly defended air base, situated {{in the middle of}} enemy territory. It had no regular air forces, being only a training centre. Nonetheless, the RAF personnel at the base converted as many of the training aircraft as possible to carry weapons.|$|E
25|$|In Iraq, the Ba'ath party {{remained}} a civilian group and lacked {{strong support from}} the military. The party had little impact, and the movement split into several factions after 1958 and again in 1966. The movement {{was reported to have}} lacked strong popular support; however, through the construction of a strong party apparatus the party succeeded in gaining power. The Iraqi-based party was originally committed to Pan-Arabism (like its Syrian counterpart); after taking power in 1968 the party adopted Iraqi nationalism, and encouraging <b>Iraqis</b> <b>to</b> identify themselves as cultural heirs of Mesopotamia with a medieval-Islamic identity. Saddam Hussein sought to be seen as leader of a great, neo-Mesopotamian Iraqi nation by having himself compared to Nebuchadnezzar II and Hammurabi.|$|E

25|$|Mithal al-Alusi, {{a secular}} Muslim Iraqi lawmaker, who is openly pro-Israel, paid {{a heavy price}} for visiting Israel in September 2004, criticizing Hamas and Hezbollah as {{terrorist}} organizations, and advocating peace with the Jewish state. Upon his return to Iraq, the Sunni politician was immediately removed from Ahmed Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress Party (INC). In 2005, apparently as payback, a gunmen opened fire on Alusi's car just after it left his house, killing two of his sons, Ayman, 21, and Jamal, 30, while he escaped unharmed. According to Alusi, there is no Iraqi-Israeli problem, {{and the interests of}} the two countries are parallel; thus, he advocates strategic relations between Iraq and Israel against terrorism. Alusi returned to Israel for a second visit in September 2008. Upon his return to Iraq, he was stripped of parliamentary immunity so that he could face charges of traveling illicitly to Israel. Later that year, Iraq's Federal Supreme Court ruled in his favor, maintaining it was no longer a crime for <b>Iraqis</b> <b>to</b> travel to Israel.|$|E
25|$|Iraq was a {{signatory}} to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, placing its reactors under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. In October 1981, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists published {{excerpts from}} the testimony of Roger Richter, a former IAEA inspector who described the weaknesses of the agency's nuclear safeguards to the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Richter testified that only part of Iraq's nuclear installation was under safeguard and that the most sensitive facilities were not even subject to safeguards. IAEA's Director-General Sigvard Eklund issued a rebuttal saying that Richter had never inspected Osirak and had never been assigned to inspect facilities in the Middle East. Eklund claimed that the safeguards procedures were effective {{and that they were}} supplemented by precautionary measures taken by the nuclear suppliers. Anthony Fainberg, a physicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, disputed Richter's claim that a fuel processing program for the manufacturing of nuclear weapons could have been conducted secretly. Fainberg wrote that there was barely enough fuel on the site to make one bomb, and that the presence of hundreds of foreign technicians would have made it impossible for the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>to</b> take the necessary steps without being discovered.|$|E

The state would hold the nation's first presidential caucus in January 2008. His entrance into the race slightly increased voter's recognition of [...] "Thompson" [...] in polls but pollsters stated that this increase was most likely attributed to the exposure of potential candidate Fred Thompson. He remained at 2% in presidential polls, in sixth place overall behind potential candidates Newt Gingrich and Fred Thompson, but ahead of declared candidates Ron Paul, Jim Gilmore, Tom Tancredo, Sam Brownback, Duncan Hunter and Mike Huckabee. Statewide polls placed Thompson at 24% {{in his home state}} of Wisconsin, which was considerably higher than the marks achieved by other lower tiered candidates in their home states. [...] Upon his entrance, the candidate set forth his position on the War in Iraq, holding that as president, he would allow <b>Iraqis</b> <b>to</b> vote on whether or not the United States military should remain in the nation.
