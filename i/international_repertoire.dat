5|$|In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a {{more solid}} operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep {{a place in the}} <b>international</b> <b>repertoire.</b> Because of its biblical subject, the {{composer}} had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation. Although the work eventually became an international success it was not staged at the Paris Opéra until 1892.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen {{maintained}} {{the reputation of}} an outsider during his lifetime, both {{in his own country}} and internationally. It was only later that his works firmly entered the <b>international</b> <b>repertoire,</b> accelerating in popularity from the 1960s through Leonard Bernstein and others. In Denmark, Nielsen's reputation was sealed in 2006 when three of his compositions were listed by the Ministry of Culture amongst the twelve greatest pieces of Danish music. For many years, he appeared on the Danish hundred-kroner banknote. The Carl Nielsen Museum in Odense documents his life and that of his wife. Between 1994 and 2009 the Royal Danish Library, sponsored by the Danish government, completed the Carl Nielsen Edition, freely available online, containing background information and sheet music for all Nielsen's works, many of which had not been previously published.|$|E

25|$|During his centenary in 1903, while {{receiving}} {{attention from}} all leading musical reference books, {{he was still}} not generally accepted as {{being one of the}} great composers. Some of his music was still in neglect and his following was smaller than other, mainly German, composers. Even half a century did not change much, and it took until the 1960s for the right questions to be asked about his work, and for it to be viewed in a more balanced and sympathetic light. One of the pivotal events in this fresh ignition of interest in the composer was a performance of Les Troyens by Rafael Kubelík in 1957 at Covent Garden. The music of Berlioz enjoyed a revival during the 1960s and 1970s, {{due in large part to}} the efforts of French conductor Charles Munch and of British conductor Sir Colin Davis, who recorded his entire oeuvre, bringing to light a number of Berlioz's lesser-known works. An unusual (but telling) example of the increase of Berlioz's fame in the 1960s was an explosion of forged autographs, manuscripts, and letters, evidently created to cater for a much greater interest in the composer. Davis's recording of Les Troyens was the first near-complete recording of that work. The work, which Berlioz never saw staged in its entirety during his life, is now a part of the <b>international</b> <b>repertoire,</b> if still something of a rarity. Les Troyens was the first opera performed at the newly built Opéra Bastille in Paris on 17 March 1990 in a production claimed to be complete, but lacking the ballets.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen {{composed}} several {{chamber music}} works, {{some of them}} still high on the <b>international</b> <b>repertoire.</b> The Wind Quintet, {{one of his most}} popular pieces, was composed in 1922 specifically for the Copenhagen Wind Quintet. Simpson, explaining that Nielsen's fondness of wind instruments was closely related to his love of nature, writes: [...] "He was also intensely interested in human character, and in the Wind Quintet composed deliberately for five friends; each part is cunningly made to suit the individuality of each player." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{a period}} of illness Verdi began work on Macbeth in September 1846. He {{dedicated}} the opera to Barezzi: [...] "I have long intended to dedicate an opera to you, as {{you have been a}} father, a benefactor and a friend for me. It was a duty I should have fulfilled sooner if imperious circumstances had not prevented me. Now, I send you Macbeth, which I prize above all my other operas, and therefore deem worthier to present to you." [...] In 1997 Martin Chusid wrote that Macbeth {{was the only one of}} Verdi's operas of his [...] "early period" [...] to remain regularly in the <b>international</b> <b>repertoire,</b> although in the 21st century Nabucco has also entered the lists.|$|E

500|$|After {{the initial}} excitement, audiences quickly diminished. Operagoers were nonplussed {{by the absence}} of big {{traditional}} arias and choruses. A contemporary critic summed it up: [...] "'Is this our Verdi?' they asked themselves. 'But where is the motive; where are the broad melodies... where are the usual ensembles; the finales?'" [...] By the time of Verdi's death in 1901 the work had fallen out of the <b>international</b> <b>repertoire.</b> The rising young conductor Arturo Toscanini was a strong advocate of the work, and did much to save it from neglect. As musical director of La Scala (from 1898) and the Metropolitan Opera (from 1908), he programmed Falstaff from the start of his tenure. Richard Aldrich, music critic of The New York Times, wrote that Toscanini's revival [...] "ought to be marked in red letters in the record of the season. Falstaff, which was first produced here on Feb.4. 1895, has not been given since the following season, and was heard in these two seasons only half a dozen times in all." [...] Aldrich added that though the general public might have had difficulty with the work, [...] "to connoisseurs it was an unending delight".|$|E
2500|$|The <b>international</b> <b>repertoire</b> {{of music}} for {{mandolin}} is almost unlimited, and musicians {{use it to}} play various types of music. This {{is especially true of}} violin music, since the mandolin has the same tuning as the violin. Following its invention and early development in Italy the mandolin spread throughout the European continent. The instrument was primarily used in a classical tradition with Mandolin orchestras, so called Estudiantinas or in Germany Zupforchestern appearing in many cities. Following this continental popularity of the mandolin family local traditions appeared outside Europe in the Americas and in Japan. Travelling mandolin virtuosi like Giuseppe Pettine, Raffaele Calace and Silvio Ranieri contributed to the mandolin becoming a [...] "fad" [...] instrument in the early 20th century. This [...] "mandolin craze" [...] was fading by the 1930s, but just as this practice was falling into disuse, the mandolin found a new niche in American country, old-time music, bluegrass and folk music. More recently, the Baroque and Classical mandolin repertory and styles have benefited from the raised awareness of and interest in Early music, with media attention to classical players such as Israeli Avi Avital, Italian Carlo Aonzo and American Joseph Brent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} German written lute music started with Arnolt Schlick ( [...] 1460–after 1521), who, in 1513, {{published}} {{a collection of}} pieces that included 14 voice and lute songs, and three solo lute pieces, alongside organ works. He {{was not the first}} important German lutenist, because contemporaries credited Conrad Paumann ( [...] 1410–1473) with the invention of German lute tablature, though this claim remains unproven, and no lute works by Paumann survive. After Schlick, a string of composers developed German lute music: Hans Judenkünig ( [...] 1445/50–1526), the Neusidler family (particularly Hans Neusidler ( [...] 1508/09–1563)) and others. During {{the second half of the}} 16th century, German tablature and German repertoire were gradually replaced by Italian and French tablature and <b>international</b> <b>repertoire,</b> respectively, and the Thirty Years War (1618–48) effectively stopped publications for half a century. German lute music was revived much later by composers such as Esaias Reusner ( [...] 1670), however, a distinctly German style came only after 1700 in the works of Silvius Leopold Weiss (1686–1750), one of the greatest lute composers, some of whose works were transcribed for keyboard by none other than Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750), who composed a few pieces for the lute himself (though it is unclear whether they were really intended for the lute, rather than another plucked string instrument or the lautenwerk).|$|E
