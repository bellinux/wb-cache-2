Some Jewish community leaders cite the statements as the latest evidence that Muslim-Jewish dialogue is futile in today's charged atmosphere. John Rosove, senior rabbi of Temple Israel of Hollywood, and other Jewish participants withdrew from the three-year-old Muslim-Jewish <b>dialogue</b> <b>group</b> {{after one of the}} Muslim participants, Salam al-Marayati of MPAC, suggested in a radio interview that Israel should be put on the list of suspects behind the 11 September attacks. However, in January 2011, MPAC member Wa’el Azmeh and Temple Israel engaged in an interfaith dialogue.|$|E

The Plan of Action was released as an Aspen Institute publication and calls upon the U.S. and Vietnamese governments to join with other governments, foundations, businesses, and nonprofits in a partnership to clean up dioxin [...] "hot spots" [...] in Vietnam and to expand humanitarian services {{for people with disabilities}} there. On September 16, 2010, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) acknowledged the work of the <b>Dialogue</b> <b>Group</b> by releasing a statement {{on the floor of the}} United States Senate. The statement urges the U.S. government to take the Plan of Action's recommendations into account in developing a multi-year plan of activities to address the Agent Orange/dioxin legacy.|$|E

40|$|In {{an effort}} to combat racism, antiracist activists often use the {{structure}} of <b>dialogue</b> <b>groups</b> for interracial and transcul-tural discussions. The assumption that spoken English is an equally accessible language can pose barriers to participation in such groups. The use of art processes in interracial <b>dialogue</b> <b>groups</b> can shift the power dynamics within the group by giv-ing “voice ” to members who are less able to utilize either ver-bal processes or the dominant verbal language. The author defines and describes Large <b>Group</b> <b>Dialogue</b> (LGD) as a spe-cific type of group encounter, discusses the dynamics of lan-guage and oppression, and advocates {{for the use of}} artmaking in interracial LGD.

2500|$|Citizen-to-citizen {{dialogue}} {{for individuals}} to call for accountability by the United States government was first established in 2006 by the Ford Foundation.

[...] The US-Vietnam <b>Dialogue</b> <b>Group</b> on Agent Orange/Dioxin, composed of members of the Aspen Institute, Vietnam National University, and Vietnam Veterans Association, is the most notable example of this civic response.

40|$|<b>Dialogue</b> <b>groups</b> {{that bring}} {{together}} civilians with many perspectives on a conflict and hold face-to-face discussions differ. Facilitators of <b>dialogue</b> <b>groups</b> often claim that their type of dialogue is especially conducive to long-term {{peace and stability}} and results in a wider-ranging set of beneficial effects. To evaluate such claims, this paper delineates <b>dialogue</b> <b>groups</b> and their goals by type (and offers a case study to illustrate its structure) : 1) dialogue that transforms human relationships {{in order to build}} interpersonal trust and reduce prejudice (E. g. Jewish-Palestinian Living Room Dialogue focused on the Arab-Israeli conflict); 2) dialogue that transforms understanding of political interest through consideration of the political interest of others in order to build a common political vision for the future (E. g. Community Dialogue based on the conflict in Northern Ireland); and 3) dialogue that transforms political decision-making from interest-oriented to public-spirited-oriented dialogue in order to find mutually agreeable solutions (E. g. Deliberative Polling Weekends based on problems within mainly developed, peaceful Western countries like America). There is no evidence that one type is superior i...|$|R
40|$|Interreligious and intercultural {{dialogue}} between Arabs, Muslims and Jews, {{in the context}} of formal <b>dialogue</b> <b>groups,</b> is a fairly recent phenomenon. In Montreal, for instance, interreligious dialogue between Christians and Jews is over fifty years old, while Muslim-Jewish interreligious dialogue has been taking place for less than a decade, and Arab-Jewish dialogue has been occurring only {{for the past five years}} or so. At present, Montreal is home to several such <b>dialogue</b> <b>groups,</b> three of which are examined in this thesis, in an effort to determine: why these groups were initiated; the motives, priorities and goals of leaders and participants; the experiences of participants, and the impact, if any, that the <b>dialogue</b> <b>groups</b> have had on participants and the involved communities. This thesis also investigates the connection between religion and dialogue, in terms of group programming and participants' experience and perspectives, and the relationship between dialogue and political/social activism. Data collected through interviews with dialogue leaders, participants and critics is analyzed with respect to dialogue theory. Finally, an analysis on the role of dialogue in promoting coexistence and conflict resolution is presented. Thesis (M. A.) [...] Concordia University (Canada), 2006. School code: 0228...|$|R

5000|$|The Montreal <b>Dialogue</b> <b>Group</b> {{was founded}} in January 2003 by Nada Sefian, a Palestinian Muslim born in Lebanon and Ronit Yarosky, a Canadian-Israeli Jew. Before {{starting}} the Montreal <b>Dialogue</b> <b>Group,</b> Sefian and Yarosky worked as members of several groups in political activism for the Israel Palestinian conflict. However they found the groups to be inflexible and unable to lead a solution for Arabs and Jews. They left the activist groups and formed the Montreal chapter of Women in Black, a global anti-occupation lobby group that organized weekly anti-occupation [...] "vigils" [...] outside the Israel consulate in Montreal. Sefian and Yarosky found the groups to be unproductive and felt that a new approach was needed to bring the two communities together. In 2003 Sefian and Yarosky organized a talk by Diana Bhuttu, a Palestinian-Canadian lawyer specializing in the Palestinian authority. Around the same time, Sefian was involved in simulating conversation with Jews in a drama therapy conflict resolution workshop at Concordia University. They were convinced {{of the power of}} dialogue and this led to the first meeting of Montreal <b>Dialogue</b> <b>Group,</b> in which Sefian, Yarosky, and two Israel-Canadian women participated and shared personal stories. At the second meeting, Yarosky, some fellow Jewish friends as well as Sefian's and some of her Palestinian and Arabic participated; the Arabic-Jewish dialogue began. The Montreal <b>Dialogue</b> <b>Group</b> was also encouraged by the principles and successes of the Jewish-Palestinian Living Room <b>Dialogue</b> <b>Group</b> in California.|$|E
