500|$|The {{black bean}} aphid [...] can feed {{on a wide}} variety of host plants. Its primary hosts on which the eggs overwinter are shrubs such as the spindle tree (Euonymus europaeus), Viburnum species, or the mock-orange (Philadelphus species). Its {{secondary}} hosts, on which it spends the summer, include a number of crops including [...] sugar beets, spinach, beans, runner beans, celery, potatoes, sunflowers, carrots, artichokes, tobacco, and tomatoes. It colonises more than two hundred different species of cultivated and wild plants. Among the latter, it shows a preference for poppies (Papaver species), burdock (Arctium tomentonum), <b>fat-hen</b> (Chenopodium album), saltbush (Atriplex rosea), chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla), thistles (Cirsium arvense), and docks (Rumex spp.).|$|E

One {{of its two}} prominent plant communities is a dense coastal dune shrubland composed of medium shrubs, such as coast wattle and coast beard-heath, above a ground cover of grasses, herbs and sedges. The other is a mosaic of aquatic herbland, coastal saltmarsh and damp saline pasture, composed of species such as beaded glasswort, creeping brookweed, shiny swamp-mat, buck's-horn plantain and <b>fat-hen.</b>|$|E
50|$|Though {{cultivated}} in some regions, {{the plant is}} elsewhere considered a weed. Common names include lamb's quarters, melde, goosefoot and <b>fat-hen,</b> though the latter two are also applied to other species of the genus Chenopodium, for which reason it is often distinguished as white goosefoot. It is sometimes also called pigweed. However, pigweed is also a name for a few weeds in the family Amaranthaceae; it is for example used for the redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus).|$|E

He is introduced in chapter 1 as follows:At that time, there lived three brothers in Julu Commandery: Zhang Jue, Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang. Zhang Jiao {{was a failure}} in the county level examination. He {{had gone into the}} mountains to gather some medicinal herbs, when he came across an old man; the old man had a youthful countenance, and was carrying a <b>fat-hen</b> walking stick. The old man beckoned Jue into a cave, presented him with a book in three volumes which had come from the heavens, then said, [...] "This book is called The Essential Art of Great Peace. Once you have mastered its contents, you will represent the heavens in spreading this knowledge, and thereby save all of mankind. If you start to have second thoughts, there will be terrible consequences for you." [...] Jue enquired as to the old man's name. The old man said, [...] "I am the old immortal spirit from the southern lands." [...] With that, the old man vanished into thin air. Upon receiving this book, Jue practiced night and day. Eventually, he could summon the wind and rain, and {{came to be known as}} the Great Peace Taoist. (Wikisource translation) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{explores the}} agricultural landscape in southwestern Norway during the Viking Age. Based on macrofossil {{samples from the}} site Sømme in Rogaland fylke the prehistoric use of cultivated and non-cultivated plants are analysed and compared to previous studies {{and the state of}} knowledge. The thesis also investigates the potential social status of the site Sømme, the silversmithy and the smith. The results suggest Hulled barley (Hordeum vulgare) was cultivated nearby based on charred seeds found in postholes of the house. Nitrogen demanding plants, such as <b>Fat-hen</b> (Chenopodium album), were also found, which suggests an agricultural practise that involved manuring. The social status of Sømme and the silversmith is likely to have been quite high. People in graves with smithy tools in Norway are considered to have held a high social status. In Joa, close to Sømme, is one such grave. The smith has most likely been in direct contact with the ruling class when crafting jewellery...|$|E
40|$|The plant {{protection}} service of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg conducted from 2010 – 2013 a field trial program on different locations for the development and evaluation of chemical weed control methods in soybean. In this trails the use of herbicides enabled a yield of + 4 dt*ha- 1 respectively 118 % in comparison to untreated control. The selectivity of herbicide applications was uncomplicated except for treatments with inclusion of Pendimethalin. Cleavers (Galium aparine) and black bindweed (Polygonum convolvulus) were harder to control than other common weeds. Cockspur grass (Echinochloa crus-galli) was also insufficient controlled, {{but there was no}} addition use of specific grass weed herbicides in the application programs. The total weed control efficacy for all treatments was proved in a range of 84 - 97 %. <b>Fat-hen</b> (Chenopodium album) as the most important weed in soybean could be controlled by specific herbicide treatments in a range of 83 - 99 %. For integrated weed management it is necessary to consider the site specific weed spectrum, herbicide specific efficacy and the amount in respect to the local soil and weather conditions. As a result of the trials it was possible to authorize the minor use of three further herbicides in soybeans. In consequence there is a comfortable variety of different herbicides in soybean available...|$|E
40|$|The {{herbicide}} GOLTIX® TITAN® is {{the unique}} {{combination of two}} active ingredients, Metamitrone (525 g/L) and Quinmerac (40 g/L). GOLTIX® TITAN® {{is used for the}} control of annual dicotyledonous weeds in sugar and fodder beets. Registration was granted for the post emergence splitting application with 3 x 2, 0 L/ha (3 applications). This corresponds to the amount of 3150 g Metamitrone and 240 g Quinmerac per hectare at maximum application rate. The registration application for pre-emergence application has been submitted. Several field trials were carried out between 2009 and 2013. These trials revealed the optimized efficacy on important weeds in sugar beet production including Fool´s parsley (Aethusa cynapium), Cleavers (Gallium aparine) and <b>Fat-hen</b> (Chenopodium album). Selectivity was examined in all of these trials and showed good results with all relevant mixtures at all application times. The two active ingredients have different modes of action; hence, the product {{plays an important role in}} resistance management. They can be applied flexibly and do not have any known negative influence on the environment. The successful formulation of this highly sophisticated sugar beet herbicide was confirmed by the available trial results. GOLTIX® TITAN® with its specified characteristics is the base for every weed control measure...|$|E
40|$|Recently, <b>fat-hen</b> (Chenopodium album L.) biotypes {{resistant}} to metamitron, a key herbicide in sugar beet, were recorded. Pot experiments revealed that these biotypes showed cross-resistance to metribuzin, a triazinone used in potato. Greenhouse and laboratory experiments {{were performed to}} develop resistance monitoring tests, so that resistant biotypes can be detected quickly and farmers may adapt their weed management. Resistant and susceptible biotypes were grown in a greenhouse under conditions of natural and artificial light at an intensity of 100 μmol photons m- 2 s- 1. Leaves were collected and, immersed in a solution of 1000 μM metamitron and 500 μM metribuzin, exposed to natural and artificial light (1000, 750 and 100 μmol photons m- 2 s- 1 respectively). After this, chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were carried out. The results revealed that the photosynthetic electron transport of metamitron- and metribuzin-incubated leaves of resistant biotypes decreased {{less than that of}} the incubated leaves of susceptible biotypes. The differences between the metribuzin-incubated leaves of the susceptible and resistant biotypes were larger than those observed with the metamitron-incubated leaves. The aim of the experiments was to optimise the chlorophyll fluorescence test and to find a sufficiently high correlation between the results of the pot experiments and the chlorophyll fluorescence measurements...|$|E
40|$|Weeds infest {{economically}} important crops causing marked {{losses in}} agrarian production, forests, and ornamental heritages. Weed pests, including parasitic plants, have always being recognised {{as one of}} the most serious agricultural and environmental problems due to competition with the growth of agrarian crops and forest plants by subtraction of water, nutrients, light and by the serious obstacles they represent for agronomic activities. A number of weed management strategies have been followed in agriculture production, including mechanical, cultural, chemical, and biological strategies. The use of soil physical mechanical and cultural methods do not provide a satisfactory solution to weed problems. On the other hand, the use of chemical pesticides differing widely in respect to spectrum, unit activity, crop safety, toxicology, and environmental effects has increased herbicidal resistance and environmental and toxicological concerns raise a question mark over their large scale use. Consequently, many efforts were focused on the development of alternative strategies based on the use of natural products and in particular on the use of fungal phytotoxins alone as natural herbicides and/or in combination with fungal producers in a more efficient and integrated management. Fungal phytotoxins are secondary metabolites that belong to different classes of naturally occurring compounds. They play an important role in the induction of disease symptoms in agrarian and forest plants and weeds. This thesis reports on the isolation, purification and chemical and biological characterization of phytotoxins produced by four fungi proposed as potential mycoherbicides for the biological control of some noxious weeds: a) Diaporte gulyae and D. kongii, fungi proposed as potential mycoherbicides of Carthamus lanatus L. ssp. lanatus, a widespread winter-growing annual weed of both pastures and crop throughout Australia introduced from the Mediterranean region. b) Alternaria sonchi, fungus evaluated as a possible biocontrol agent of Sonchus arvensis L., commonly called perennial sowthistle, a plant species considered to be an important weed in Europe and North America as it infests many habitats such as cultivated fields, roadsides, pastures and rangelands, railway embankments, and lawns. c) Phoma chenopodiicola, fungus proposed as potential mycoherbicide for the control of Chenopodium album (common lambsquarters or <b>fat-hen),</b> one of the most successful colonizing species, which has been reported to infest plantations of sugar beets, potatoes, maize, cereals, and vegetables all over the world...|$|E
