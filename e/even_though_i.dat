5|$|My love is {{stronger}} than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. I do not love less, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. I used to sing my praises very frequently when our love was new, like the nightingale which sings {{in the summer and}} stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, I, like the nightingale, have stopped writing. I do not wish my poems to become boring.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} saw the notable loss of Hauptmann Karl-Heinz Weber, {{commander}} of III./JG 1 {{who was shot}} down and killed by Mustangs. It was from Le Mans that JG 1 started to perform fighter-bomber (Jagdbomber or Jabo) missions, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I.</b> nor II./JG 1 had any specialised training. On 8 June 1944 both gruppen were sent off on ground-attack missions. 25 Fw 190s of II./JG 1 attacked Allied shipping off the Normandy coast unmolested. RAF aircraft bombed Le Mans airfield {{on the night of}} 9 June, resulting in II./JG 1 losing seven aircraft and five damaged. Oberleutnant Rüdiger von Kirchmayr flew back to 4./JG 1 after hospitalization on 12 June in Störmede, and en route he was attacked by Spitfires over Flers, claiming an unconfirmed kill as a result. There was a follow-up bombing attack on 15 June resulting in a loss of two more Fw 190s.|$|E
25|$|In Nashville, I {{was running}} eight miles a day, {{hanging out with}} my friends, walking around eating chocolate-chip cookies and playing a lot of drums, which I enjoyed. Life was easy. I was never {{frustrated}} – <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> wasn't fulfilling my contract obligations. If you are failing in Nashville, at least your standard of living is nice. Nashville is {{a nice way to}} fail.|$|E

60|$|From Edinburgh to Greenock, I had the ex-secretary of the E.U. Conservative Club, Murdoch. At Greenock I spent {{a dismal}} <b>evening,</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> found a pretty walk. Next day {{on board the}} Iona, I had Maggie Thomson to Tarbet; Craig, a well-read, {{pleasant}} medical, to Ardrishaig; and Professor, Mrs., and all the little Fleeming Jenkinseses to Oban.|$|R
60|$|I am in lovely health again to-day: I-walked {{as far as}} the Pont St. Louis very nearly, besides {{walking and}} {{knocking}} about among the olives in the afternoon. I do not make much progress with my French; but I do make a little, I think. I was pleased with my success this <b>evening,</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> do not know if others shared the satisfaction.|$|R
25|$|If I say a {{whole system}} must be upset for me to win, I am saying that I cannot sit in the game, and that safer rules {{must be made to}} give me a chance. I {{repudiate}} that. If others are in there, deal me a hand and let me see what I can make of it, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> know some in there are dealing from the bottom and cheating like hell in other ways.|$|E
25|$|The {{one that}} {{finished}} my career was when I got hit in my eye by John Maguire from Queensland...He got one to really rear up, and I {{got back to}} hook and it went between the visor and the top part of the helmet and smashed in my eye. That finished me. After that, I didn't want to be there. I thought of other things I wanted to do in life. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> continued playing on in Shield {{for two or three}} years, I just didn't want to be there.|$|E
25|$|My {{mother always}} told me {{that no matter how}} much you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find {{characteristics}} about them that you like. Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E

25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{reviving}} the rallying program, one of Hayes first accomplishments was to sign relatively unknown Scottish racing driver Jackie Stewart. Stewart was attending the 1964 British International Motor Show at Earl's Court, London, when Hayes approached him and later offered Stewart £500 to promote Ford products in 1965, {{along with the}} white Ford Zodiac that was the centrepiece of Ford's exhibit to drive that year. Stewart later commented: “I didn’t know who Walter Hayes was, but I did know that to have a contract with Ford Motor Company {{was a big deal}} with great opportunities for the future, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> wasn’t yet aware that Ford would enter Formula One.” The relationship was to last forty years, and be so successful it was the model for other Formula One stars and motor manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E
5000|$|Juliet Landau, {{excited to}} return to Angel, says, [...] "this is a {{particularly}} fun episode... There {{are so many different}} colors and dimensions. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> and <b>I</b> are the villains and we are evil, there always has been this very sweet love story between us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Ay, we'll {{just ask}} ye {{when we want}} ye,' said she, {{and shut the door}} in my face. Annoyed at the churlish rebuff, I turned my back and walked home. All <b>evening,</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> tried to think of other things, my mind would still turn to the {{apparition}} at the window and the rudeness of the woman. I determined to say nothing about the former to my wife, for she is a nervous, highly strung woman, and I had no wish that she would share the unpleasant impression which had been produced upon myself. I remarked to her, however, before I fell asleep, that the cottage was now occupied, to which she returned no reply.|$|R
50|$|Nouns {{that end}} in -ius, {{instead of the}} {{expected}} -ie end with -ī. Thus, Julius becomes Julī and filius becomes filī. The shortening does not shift the accent so the vocative of Vergilius is Vergilī, with accent on the second syllable <b>even</b> <b>though</b> it is short. Nouns that end in -aius and -eius have vocatives that end in -aī or -eī <b>even</b> <b>though</b> the <b>i</b> in the nominative is consonantal.|$|R

500|$|Bhardwaj is {{influenced}} by the film-making styles of Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Akira Kurosawa and Krzysztof Kieślowski. Kieslowski's Dekalog (1989) inspired him to become a film-maker. Veteran actor Naseeruddin Shah says: [...] "I think he makes interesting films, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> haven’t liked all his works. But even his poor work is more interesting than a lot of people’s so-called good work.” ...|$|E

50|$|It's {{interesting}} to note that this game is set on Earth. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> Ultima <b>I</b> is set on the fictional land of Sosaria, Ultima II borrowed characters and the story of Ultima I, but relocated them to Earth with no explanation. Later games in the Ultima series ret-conned this, and assumed that Ultima II actually happened on Sosaria, not Earth, to create a continuity among the games.|$|R
60|$|Could I {{not still}} be loyal in {{heart and mind}} to Fanny, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> now <b>I</b> knew how little she cared whether I was loyal or not? I even climbed up behind Mr Crimble's thick {{spectacles}} and looked down again at myself from that point of vantage. Whether or not I was his affair, I could try to make him mine--perhaps even persuade Fanny to love him.|$|R

500|$|Unable {{to contain}} her fires, Kaga {{survivors}} were taken {{off by the}} destroyers [...] and [...] between 14:00 and 17:00. Around 19:25 she was scuttled by two torpedoes from Hagikaze and sank stern-first at position [...] Ensign Takeshi Maeda, an injured Kaga B5N aircrew member rescued by Hagikaze, described the scene: [...] "My comrade carried me up to the deck so I could see the last moments of our beloved carrier, which was nearby. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> was in pain tears started to run down my cheeks, and everyone around me was crying; {{it was a very}} sad sight." ...|$|E

60|$|Dejah Thoris {{would have}} none of me again on this <b>evening,</b> and <b>though</b> <b>I</b> spoke her name she neither replied, nor conceded by so much as the flutter of an eyelid that she {{realized}} my existence. In my extremity I did what most other lovers would have done; I sought word from her through an intimate. In this instance it was Sola whom I intercepted in another part of camp.|$|R

500|$|... "Don't {{fuck with}} the formula" [...] is a quote and subject of {{controversy}} {{attributed to the}} Beach Boys' lyricist and co-lead vocalist Mike Love circa 1967. Love called it the [...] "most famous thing I've ever said, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> never said it." [...] It originates from a 1971 Rolling Stone magazine article written by freelancer Tom Nolan, in which business associate David Anderle reported disagreements from within the Beach Boys' circle. According to Anderle, Love wanted the band to remain profitable for himself—"and don't fuck with the formula." [...] In the ensuing decades, the line has been repeated in myriad books, articles, websites, and blogs.|$|E
500|$|Price Peterson, {{writing for}} TV.com, gave a glowing review, calling it [...] "the best-yet episode of Veronica Mars". He {{elaborated}} by stating, This episode {{was just a}} total triumph for how it brought together SO MUCH from the past 22 episodes and beyond. I loved the Aaron Echolls assassination. I loved that last image of Duncan enjoying his victory in a perpetual magic hour on some Australian beach. I especially loved the It's a Wonderful Life-esque dream sequence. This episode was so good that <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> knew Beaver was the bad guy, I still came away shocked {{by many of the}} reveals. That's just good writing right there. Conversely, Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B+".|$|E
500|$|I had two {{ideas that}} did not fit the song. She said no <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> had a very clear idea of how she would look in the video. I worked up on another idea and brought {{together}} a featured band for her to see. I did it all in front of me. [...] In retrospect, it feels good, the video we have done much better suited to the track than the first ideas. [...] has an incredible track on everything she is doing. Style, music, business— she has a mental track of every single thing and won't give up until she is completely satisfied. And on music videos there is nothing she does {{with one hand on}} her back— she's engaged to one hundred percent.|$|E

"As we {{went down}} the winding stepway to our hotel again in the {{twilight}} I foresaw it all: I saw how clearly and inevitably things were driving for war in Gresham's silly, violent hands, and I had some inkling of what war {{was bound to be}} under these new conditions. And <b>even</b> then, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> knew it was drawing near the limit of my opportunity, I could find no will to go back." ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{said in my}} {{last that}} it was best for nobody to write to me, and as my sending you another little letter can {{therefore}} give you no other trouble than the trouble of reading it (perhaps you may not find leisure for <b>even</b> that, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> hope you will some day), I am now going to devote an hour to writing to you again.

6000|$|On October 31, the Rev. Samuel Wilberforce, then Archdeacon of Surrey, {{and since}} Bishop of Oxford and of Winchester, preached {{in the morning}} at New Windsor parish church, and the newly-made Bishop of New Zealand in the afternoon. Coley was far more {{affected}} than he then had power to express. He says: 'I heard Archdeacon Wilberforce in the morning, and the Bishop in the <b>evening,</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> was forced to stand all the time. It was beautiful when he talked of his going out to found a church, and then to die neglected and forgotten. All the people burst out crying, he was so very much beloved by his parishioners. He spoke of his perils, and putting his trust in God; and then, when, he had finished, I think I never heard anything like the sensation, a kind of feeling that {{if it had not been}} on so sacred a spot, all would have exclaimed [...] "God bless him!"' ...|$|R
