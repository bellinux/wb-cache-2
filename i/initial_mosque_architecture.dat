40|$|Mosques {{are among}} the most {{important}} building types for any community, where Muslims gather for their prayers and social activities. <b>Mosque</b> <b>architecture</b> has developed over history and faced several dramatic changes. This raises a question regarding the reality of <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture</b> and how it should look like today. This paper discusses this issue through a historical overview and some critical observations. Firstly, the paper discusses the historical functional role of mosque basic elements. Validity of these elements within the context of modern architecture has been argued considering the contemporary inputs that {{have a significant impact on}} <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture.</b> Several cases are presented and discussed in this regard. The study concluded that there is a great symbolic and spiritual value of these elements that should be maintained. The analysis carried out of several contemporary cases revealed that there is a wide margin to revive and reintroduce these elements in the light of the modern architectural trends. In addition to their functional roles, mosque architectural elements could be used as identity elements of the Islamic city, microclimatic modifiers, and linking tools between the past and the present...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to explore}} the usage, the formal and {{functional}} transformation of minarets in contemporary <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture</b> in Turkey, through {{a survey of the}} selected cases. The selected cases are the outstanding examples of Turkish contemporary <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture.</b> Their architects are innovative in their design decisions and displayed their own design approach and interpretation outside the main stream contemporary mosque design in Turkey. In this study, six mosques for every decade begin ning from 1960 ‟s are analyzed in terms of their general architectural features, the usage and interpretation of minarets in their designs. Throughout the selected cases, the modification of forms and functions are studied and compared with the pre - modern o nes as well as with each other. The changed forms and functions of minarets and the introduction of new ideas to their design are also discussed. By this way, a general evaluation regarding the developments and progress in contemporary <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture</b> in Turkey is proposed with reference to comparative results. On this basis, this study demonstrates that the main elements, organization schemes and planning setups of Classical Ottoman Mosque are still preserved in the selected mosque examples.

This study claims that, architects of contemporary mosques in Turkey are in search for newness and innovation in t heir designs as a contribution for the progress of <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture.</b> This search for innovation has mostly leaded the architects to some atypical forms, although in some cases traditional solutions and standpoints have taken place...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{researches}} {{the possible}} representation of Orientalism {{and the spread}} of Middle Eastern inspired architecture in Indonesia, particularly in Dutch colonial practices in the 19 th-century. It challenges the dominant opinion of the people that the Middle Eastern merchants in the East Indies were the only ones that introduced the use of kubah (dome) shape to <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture</b> in Indonesia. Consequently, this paper has two objectives: firstly, by looking at the historical relationship between religious architecture and colonial politics, especially {{in the construction of the}} Baiturrahman Mosque in Aceh and secondly, by considering Orientalism (besides those beliefs existing in Moslem communities) to be one of important intellectual agencies for mixing architectural cultural symbols. The socio-political narrative is analyzed in the context of an Indonesian-Islamic building typology and the relationship between space, people, power, and time. The research itself is based on literature searches specifically related to colonialism and orientalism, along with archive studies and field investigations, including interviews with related historical experts. In order to replace 'non-architectural' traditional roofs, which were considered as representing a less-developed civilization, Dutch political interests were instrumental in bringing the universally-styled Middle Eastern architectural elements into <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture</b> of the Netherland Indies. This political motivation ultimately led to the spread of kubah (dome) as an architectonic element in Indonesian <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture</b> throughout the archipelago, specifically in Sumatra...|$|R

For example, the idea of having an arched entrance and a central dome in mosque is clearly one borrowed from pre-Islamic, Parsian architecture. Many forms of mosques have evolved in different regions of the Islamic world including those in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. <b>Mosque</b> <b>architecture</b> mainly diffused into India during the reign of the Mughal empire in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The Mughals brought their own form of architecture that included pointed, onion-shaped domes, as seen in Delhi's Jama Masjid, Atiya Mosque (founded in 1609 A.D. in the district of Tangail, Bangladesh), Khawaza Shahbaz Mosque (founded in 1679 A.D. in Dhaka), Miah Bari Mosque (founded in the 18th century in Karapur, district of Barisal) etc. Mughal style became the dominant feature in many of the old mosques in Indian sub-continent.|$|R

An expansion of new territories ruled under Ottoman Empire in Eastern Europe (Balkan Region) and Anatolia yields an influence of Turkish mosque style {{to the regional}} architecture.

There are many studies about Ottoman <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture</b> done before but these studies fall short in terms of studying the development in plan unit design and its influence to {{the form of the}} mosques as a whole.

The survey has conducted over 51 mosques in this region, and it analyses possible variations of the evolution to the plan designs which are derived from pedentive dome mosque style. The study finds that there are six categories of the plan designs which are single dome plan, earring dome plan, multiple dome plan, duplication dome plan, courtyard dome plan and earring-courtyard dome plan. Primary domes, secondary domes and semi-domes are identified as the factors which influence variations of the plan units.
