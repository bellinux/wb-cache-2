5000|$|The third type of {{multiplayer}} play {{consists of}} trading items with another player using {{a system of}} codes. Tom Nook operates a system through which a player can [...] "ship" [...] an item to another player in another town. The player hands an item to Tom Nook and specifies the recipient's name and town, and Tom Nook gives the player a 28-character code. In the other town, the player tells the code to Tom Nook and receives the item. Another way to trade items is to travel to a friend's town and drop the item the player wants to give them. This prevents {{the loss of the}} <b>item</b> <b>code</b> which must be memorized or written down.|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of technical debt (TD) {{is an important}} step to effectively manage it. In this context, a set of indicators has been used by automated approaches to identify TD items, but some debt may not be directly identified using only metrics collected from the source code. In this work we propose CVM-TD, a model to support the {{identification of}} technical debt through code comment analysis. We performed an exploratory study on two large open sources projects with the goal of characterizing the feasibility of the proposed model to support the detection of TD through code comments analysis. The results indicate that (1) developers use the dimensions considered by CVM-TD when writing code comments, (2) CVM-TD provides a vocabulary that may be used to detect TD items, and (3) the proposed model needs to be calibrated {{in order to reduce the}} difference between comments returned by the vocabulary and those that may indicate a TD <b>item.</b> <b>Code</b> comments analysis can be used to detect TD in software projects and CVM-TD may support the development team to perform this task...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to verify the notification of information system for oral clefts in the live births declaration (DNV), studying the 3 items of DNV related to malformation. All the patients' medical records registered in oral cleft reference centers were checked. The inclusion criteria were: a) to have any oral cleft and b) to be born from 01 / 01 / 1999 to 12 / 31 / 2004. Next step was to raise the information in the vital data sector of Municipal Health Secretary, where all the DNVs identified were subjects with oral clefts (63 children). The first item presented a large subnotification (only 53. 3 of the DNVs showed the register of malformation) and all types of clefts were not notified in any scale. Highest sub notification was observed for cleft palate (70 %). Second item (description of malformation) showed similarly a high number of errors referred to palate cleft, identified only in 25 % of the cases. All the documents showed no information about the third <b>item</b> (<b>code</b> of malformation). There was no statistical difference between professionals responsible for filling out the document. In conclusion, the DNV was inefficient to register the oral cleft cases due to imperfections related to 3 items studied, especially in the absence of information about CID- 10 codes...|$|E

30|$|In addition, all of {{the items}} on the TMA were coded by two authors (SMW, KA) and two expert geoscientists, for whether each item was more likely to require {{knowledge}} about elevation information (i.e., elevation items) or knowledge about shape information (i.e., shape items). Agreement was high across the 28 items. The four raters reached consensus on 16 <b>items</b> (consensus <b>coding),</b> and three raters agreed on 22 <b>items</b> (majority <b>coding).</b> The remaining <b>items</b> were considered to substantively require both elevation and shape. To understand the effect of instruction type on item-type, items for which three or more raters agreed (majority coding) were used in the analyses (findings were substantively the same when analyses were restricted to the 16 consensus <b>coding</b> <b>items).</b> The three raters <b>coded</b> 13 <b>items</b> as elevation and nine items as shape. For ease of comparison, we conducted the item-type analyses on the proportion of items correct.|$|R

50|$|Often, solving {{one part}} of the puzzle will reveal <b>items,</b> <b>codes</b> (passwords), or {{pathways}} that in turn that help solve another part of the puzzle. The aforementioned cupboard, for example, yields a screwdriver, and the screwdriver is used to unscrew the painting, which yields a screw in return, and so on. The player must often apply lateral thinking when trying to find uses for the items retrieved in order to solve the puzzles. Codes can be in a variety of formats, usually involving simple number sequences but can also be as complex as involving colours, directions and binary; these must be entered into the appropriate elements inside the game's environment correctly in order to advance through the game.|$|R

40|$|A central claim {{shared by}} most recent models of {{short-term}} memory (STM) is that <b>item</b> knowledge is <b>coded</b> independently from order in long-term memory (LTM; e. g., the letter A is coded {{by the same}} representational unit whether it occurs at the start or end of a sequence). Serial order is computed by dynamically binding these <b>item</b> <b>codes</b> to a separate representation of order. By contrast, Botvinick and Plaut (2006) developed a parallel distributed processing (PDP) model of STM that codes for item-order information conjunctively, such that the same letter in different positions is coded differently in LTM. Their model supports {{a wide range of}} memory phenomena, and critically, STM is better for lists that include high, as opposed to low, sequential dependencies (e. g., bigram effects). Models with contextindependent item representations do not currently account for sequential effects. However, we show that their PDP model is too sensitive to these effects. A modified version of the model does better but still fails in important respects. The successes and failures can be attributed to a fundamental constraint associated with context-dependent representations. We question the viability of conjunctive coding schemes to support STM and take these findings as problematic for the PDP approach to cognition more generally...|$|R
40|$|Although {{government}} and business interest in tracking and tracing has grown enormously over the last decade, a clear and coherent overview of the topic is still lacking and is not found in (logistics) literature. This article presents a structure for development and contemporary practices of tracking and tracing. The development structure is conceptualised by three supply-chain layers: <b>item</b> <b>coding</b> (the physical layer), information architecture (the information layer); and planning and control (the control layer). On behalf of tracking and tracing, the layers represent different levels of supply-chain integration. The conceptualisation is derived from similar ideas found in literature on supply-chain management. From a scientific point of view, the structure provides a coherent and systematic organisation of tracking and tracing concepts. From the viewpoint of business administration, the structure facilitates {{the determination of the}} scope of tracking and tracing application(s), which is of management value...|$|R
5000|$|Like other schools, Yip Kei Nam {{provided}} {{its students}} {{a wide range}} of aspects in learning in the hope of achieving a comprehensive development for everyone.

30|$|The {{first phase}} of our item-level {{analysis}} began with {{two members of the}} research team (authors 1 and 2) independently categorizing the 320 items into emergent coarse- and fine-grained codes. The codes were created based on the content of the items themselves. We designed the codes to be autonomous, that is, one code could not overlap with another. This means that <b>items</b> within <b>coding</b> categories must not only have similar meaning (Weber 1990, p. 37), but codes should be mutually exclusive and exhaustive (U.S. General Accounting Office [GAO] 1996, p. 20). Mutually exclusive categories exist when no item falls between two categories, and each item is represented by only one data point. Generating exhaustive categories is met when the codebook represents all applicable items without exception. For this convention to function, we needed (a) to write code names and code definitions carefully and (b) to sort <b>items</b> into <b>codes</b> based on the single instructional practice best represented by its text.|$|R

30|$|With {{regard to}} our {{answer to the}} second {{research}} question, we note that the measured inter-rater reliability is acceptable, although still quite low (0.61).
