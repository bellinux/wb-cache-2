2500|$|The spiny {{butterfly}} ray or <b>giant</b> <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> (Gymnura altavela) is {{a species of}} {{butterfly ray}}, family Gymnuridae, native to the shallow coastal waters of the Atlantic Ocean. A large ray that can measure over [...] across, it may be distinguished from the sympatric smooth butterfly ray (G. micrura) by the spine {{at the base of}} its tail and by a small tentacular structure on the margin of each spiracle. Slow-reproducing and valued for its meat, in recent decades its population has experienced a decline of over 30%, and it has become Critically Endangered in certain parts of its range.|$|E
50|$|Further {{research}} is needed to determine whether the isolated longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays</b> in French Polynesia are in fact the same species as those from the rest of its range. Phylogenetic studies based on morphology and mitochondrial DNA indicate that the longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> is closely related to the zonetail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> (G. zonura), which shares much of its range in the Indo-Pacific. Another name for the longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> is variegated <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray.</b>|$|R

It is found in Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, possibly Kenya, and possibly Tanzania. Its natural habitats are open seas, shallow seas, estuarine waters, and coastal saline lagoons. It is threatened by habitat loss. The population is unknown but was considered common from 1940s-1960s but further studies are needed.|$|R

25|$|Potential predators of spiny <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays</b> include larger fish such as {{the great}} hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran), and marine mammals. In the {{northwest}} Atlantic, the depletion of seven large shark species by commercial fisheries {{has led to an}} increase in the population of the spiny <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> and other mid-level predators. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Anthobothrium altavelae and Pterobothrioides petterae, and the gill parasite Heteronchocotyle gymnurae.|$|R
50|$|The <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays</b> are {{the rays}} forming the genus Gymnura {{and the family}} Gymnuridae. They are found in warm oceans worldwide, and {{occasionally}} in estuaries.|$|R

50|$|The longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> (Gymnura poecilura) is {{a species}} of <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray,</b> family Gymnuridae, native to the Indo-Pacific from the Red Sea to {{southern}} Japan and western Indonesia. Growing up to 92 cm across, this ray has a lozenge-shaped pectoral fin disc about twice as wide as long, colored brown to gray above with many small, light spots. The spiracles behind its eyes have smooth rims. This species can be identified by its tail, which is {{about as long as}} the snout-to-vent distance, lacks fins, and bears nine to twelve each of alternating black and white bands.|$|R
25|$|In {{the western}} Atlantic, the spiny <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> feeds on fishes, {{including}} Leiognathus and small sharks, and squids. Off Tunisia, they feed on crustaceans, teleosts, cephalopods, lamellibranchs, and gastropods, {{in descending order}} of importance. Teleost fishes apparently become {{more important in the}} ray's diet with increasing size. An active predator, the ray typically approaches a prey item slowly before rapidly spinning around over it and striking the food with the leading edge of one of their pectoral fins. This behavior likely serves to stun the prey before capture, as the pectoral fins of <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays</b> contain a high proportion of red muscle and can deliver blows of substantial force.|$|R
50|$|The longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> {{is widely}} caught for meat and as bycatch in artisanal and {{commercial}} fisheries, including in India, Thailand, and Indonesia. It is taken using bottom trawls, bottom-set gillnets, {{and to a}} lesser degree trammel nets and other fishing gear. Though specific population and catch data are lacking, the longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> is thought to be susceptible to overfishing due to its low reproductive rate and the fact that pregnant females often abort their young when captured. Given the high intensity of fishing pressure across most of its range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened.|$|R
50|$|The zonetail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> (Gymnura zonura) is {{a species}} of fish in the Gymnuridae family. It is found in India, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. Its natural {{habitats}} are open seas, shallow seas, subtidal aquatic beds, and estuarine waters.|$|R
50|$|The body of <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays</b> is {{flattened}} {{and surrounded}} by an extremely broad disc formed by the pectoral fins, which merge {{in front of the}} head. They have a very short, thread-like, tail. They are up to 4 m in width.|$|R
50|$|Bottom-dwelling in nature, the longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> frequents sandy or muddy {{habitats}} {{in coastal}} waters shallower than 30 m. Its diet consists of bony fishes, molluscs, and crustaceans. This species {{gives birth to}} live young; the developing embryos are nourished first by yolk and later by histotroph ("uterine milk") supplied by its mother. There is no defined breeding season, and females bear litters of up to seven pups. Used for its meat, the longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> is often caught by artisanal and commercial fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Near Threatened, citing {{the high levels of}} fishing pressure within its range and its low reproductive rate.|$|R
5|$|This black, {{white and}} pink bird is quite unmistakable, {{especially}} in its erratic flight, {{which is like}} that of a <b>giant</b> <b>butterfly.</b> It is the only member of its family. The song is a trisyllabic oop-oop-oop, which gives rise to its English and scientific names.|$|R

25|$|Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{morphological}} characters, {{found that the}} pale-edged stingray is sister to a clade containing the whitespotted whipray (Himantura gerrardi), the pearl stingray (D. margaritella), and the smooth <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> (Gymnura micrura). These results support the growing consensus that neither Dasyatis nor Himantura are monophyletic.|$|R
25|$|Stingrays are a {{group of}} rays, which are {{cartilaginous}} fish related to sharks. They are classified in the suborder Myliobatoidei of the order Myliobatiformes and consist of eight families: Hexatrygonidae (sixgill stingray), Plesiobatidae (deepwater stingray), Urolophidae (stingarees), Urotrygonidae (round rays), Dasyatidae (whiptail stingrays), Potamotrygonidae (river stingrays), Gymnuridae (<b>butterfly</b> <b>rays),</b> and Myliobatidae (eagle rays).|$|R
50|$|The thread-like tail lacks dorsal or caudal fins, {{though there}} are low ridges along its length above and below. Its length is about equal to the {{distance}} between the snout tip and the vent, distinguishing this species from other <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays</b> that have shorter tails. Sometimes there is a small stinging spine (very rarely two) on the upper surface of the tail near the base. The skin is devoid of dermal denticles. This species is brown to greenish brown to gray above, with many small pale spots and sometimes also a smattering of dark dots. The tail has nine to twelve black bands alternating with white bands, which often have a small, dorsally positioned dark spot within. The underside is white, darkening {{at the edges of the}} fins. The longtail <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> attains a maximum width of 92 cm.|$|R
