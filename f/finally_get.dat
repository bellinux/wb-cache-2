5|$|In 2003, CrossGen {{published}} John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles, a four-part {{comic book}} miniseries. The story takes place {{a day or}} so after the events of Escape from New York. Snake has been given a military Humvee after his presidential pardon and makes his way to Atlantic City. Although the director's cut of Escape from New York shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was pre-planned before his capture. The job entails stealing the car in which John F. Kennedy was assassinated from a casino before delivering it to a buyer in the Gulf of Mexico. Snake partners with a man named Marrs who ends up double crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, Snake escapes and is saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron (an in-joke referring to Kurt Russell's 1992 comedy, Captain Ron). When Ron denies Snake's request to use his boat in order to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. When Snake ends up saving Ron from the Russian mob who wants money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face-to-face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed shootout. Snake gets away with the car and its actress portraying Jackie Kennedy, leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to <b>finally</b> <b>get</b> the car to the buyer's yacht, using Ron's boat, and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the firefight, the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and Snake makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job.|$|E

25|$|During the screening, {{people began}} walking out; Goodman thought {{the film was}} bombing, until {{he learned that the}} viewers were {{actually}} leaving because they were so frightened. He then realized a remake was unwise. Paramount Pictures, which acquired DreamWorks in 2005, bought the domestic rights to the film, and worldwide rights to any sequels, for USD$350,000. When the film was taken in by Paramount, several changes were made. Some scenes were cut, others added, and the original ending was scrapped, with two new endings being shot. The ending shown in theaters during the film's worldwide release {{is the only one of}} the three to feature visual effects, and it differs from the endings previously seen at the Screamfest and Burbank screenings. The theatrical release was delayed indefinitely because Paramount had put all DreamWorks productions on hold. Meanwhile, a screening for international buyers resulted in the sale of international rights in 52 countries. Only after Goodman became production chief at Paramount in June 2009 did the film <b>finally</b> <b>get</b> slated for a fall release.|$|E
25|$|In October 2010, Parka's friend Cibernético {{turned on}} him and AAA, after feeling betrayed by them when they didn't trust his claim about not joining La Sociedad, and re-formed his old group Los Bizarros with Amadeus, Billy el Malo, Charly Manson, Escoria, Nygma and Taboo. Parka and Cibernético then started a heated rivalry, during which it was implied that Cibernético had hospitalized Parka's three-year-old son. In May 2011, Parka formed El Inframundo ("The Underworld") with Dark Cuervo, Dark Espíritu, Dark Ozz and Drago to battle Los Bizarros. On June 18 at Triplemanía XIX, Parka, Ozz, Drago and Octagón were {{defeated}} by Cibernético, Billy el Malo, Charly Manson and Escoria, when Cibernético pinned Parka following a distraction from Taboo, who appeared {{at the top of}} the ramp with his son.

25|$|After {{the release}} of the album, Deaf Havana {{spent a lot of time}} touring as a support band; they would not play a {{headline}} tour until April 2012, 5 months after {{the release of}} Fools and Worthless Liars. They began by supporting Skindred on their headline tour across Europe, followed by acting as support, alongside Tek-One, to Architects on their UK tour.
