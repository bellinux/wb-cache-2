40|$|The {{water and}} <b>energy</b> <b>cycles</b> interact, making them {{generally}} closely related. Land surface models (LSMs) can describe {{the water and}} <b>energy</b> <b>cycles</b> of the land surface, but their description of the subsurface water processes is oversimplified, and lateral groundwater flow is ignored. Groundwater models (GWMs) well describe the dynamic movement of subsurface water flow, but they cannot depict the physical mechanism of the evapotranspiration (ET) process in detail. In this study, a coupled model of groundwater with simple biosphere (GWSiB) is developed based on the full coupling of a typical land surface model (SiB 2) and a three-dimensional variably saturated groundwater model (AquiferFlow). In this model, the infiltration, ET and energy transfer are simulated by SiB 2 via the soil moisture results given by the groundwater flow model. The infiltration and ET results are applied iteratively to drive the groundwater flow model. The developed model is then applied to study water cycle processes in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin in the northwest of China. The model is validated through data collected at three stations in the study area. The stations are located in a shallow groundwater depth zone, a deeper groundwater depth zone and an agricultural irrigation area.

However, for both large and small lakes, the importance of atmosphere–lake interactions in northern Canada is largely unknown. Here, the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) is used to simulate seasonal time scales for the Mackenzie River basin and northwest region of Canada, coupled to simulations of Great Bear and Great Slave Lakes using the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) to examine the interactions between large northern lakes and the atmosphere. The authors consider the lake impacts on the local water and <b>energy</b> <b>cycles</b> and on regional seasonal climate. Verification of model results is achieved with atmospheric sounding and surface flux data collected during the Canadian Global <b>Energy</b> and Water <b>Cycle</b> Experiment (GEWEX) program. The coupled atmosphere–lake model is shown to be able to successfully simulate the variation of surface heat fluxes and surface water temperatures and to give a good representation of the vertical profiles of water temperatures, the warming and cooling processes, and the lake responses to the seasonal and interannual variation of surface heat fluxes.

40|$|A {{holistic}} approach to low-energy building design is essential to ensure that any efficiency improvement strategies provide a net energy benefit {{over the life of}} the building. Previous work by the authors has established a model for informing low-energy building design based on a comparison of the life <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> demand associated with a broad range of building assemblies. This model ranks assemblies based on their combined initial and recurrent embodied energy and operational energy demand. The current study applies this model to an actual residential building in order to demonstrate the application of the model for optimising a building’s life <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> performance. The aim of this study was to demonstrate how the availability of comparable energy performance information at the building design stage can be used to better optimise a building’s energy performance. The life <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> demand of the case study building, located in the temperate climate of Melbourne, Australia, was quantified using a comprehensive embodied energy assessment technique and TRNSYS thermal energy simulation software. The building was then modelled with variations to its external assemblies in an attempt to optimise its life <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> performance. The alternative assemblies chosen were those shown through the author’s previous modelling to result in the lowest life <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> demand for each building element. The best performing assemblies for each of the main external building elements were then combined into a best-case scenario to quantify the potential life <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> savings possible compared to the original building. The study showed that significant life <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> savings are possible through the modelling of individual building elements for the case study building. While these findings relate to a very specific case, this study demonstrates the application of a model for optimising building life <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> performance that may be applied more broadly during early-stage building design to optimise life <b>cycle</b> <b>energy</b> performance...|$|R

The 3 -D MHD Anelastic Spherical Harmonic code, using slope-limited diffusion, is employed to capture convection and dynamo processes in such a young sun. The simulation is carried out in a spherical shell that encompasses 3. 8 density scale heights of the solar convection zone. We find that dynamo action {{with a high degree}} of time variation occurs, with many periodic polarity reversals every 6. 2 years. The magnetic energy also rises and falls with a regular period, with two magnetic <b>energy</b> <b>cycles</b> required to complete a polarity <b>cycle.</b> These magnetic <b>energy</b> <b>cycles</b> arise from a Lorentz-force feedback on the differential rotation, whereas the polarity reversals are present due to the spatial separation of the equatorial and polar dynamos.

This simulation also enters a grand minimum lasting roughly 20 years, after which the dynamo recovers its regular polarity cycles. Comment: Submitted to ApJL 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

Smagorinsky published a seminal paper in 1963 on his research using primitive equations of atmospheric dynamics to simulate the atmosphere’s circulation. This paper fundamentally changed the approach to modeling climate. He extended early weather models to include variables such as wind, cloud cover, precipitation, atmospheric pressure and radiation emanating from the earth and sun. In order to make these simulations possible, a method was needed to account for atmospheric turbulence that occurred on scales smaller than the model's grid size but still {{played a crucial role}} in the atmospheric <b>energy</b> <b>cycle.</b> With colleagues Douglas Lilly and James Deardorff, both at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), he developed one of the first successful approaches to large eddy simulation (e.g., the Smagorinsky-Lilly model), providing a solution to this problem that is still in use, not only in meteorology, but in all fields involving fluid dynamics.|$|E
5000|$|There are other, more {{speculative}} {{ideas about}} the future of the universe. The phantom energy model of dark energy results in divergent expansion, which would imply that the effective force of dark energy continues growing until it dominates all other forces in the universe. Under this scenario, dark energy would ultimately tear apart all gravitationally bound structures, including galaxies and solar systems, and eventually overcome the electrical and nuclear forces to tear apart atoms themselves, ending the universe in a [...] "Big Rip". It is also possible the universe may never have an end and continue in its present state forever (see The Second Law as a law of disorder). On the other hand, dark energy might dissipate with time or even become attractive. Such uncertainties leave open the possibility that gravity might yet rule the day and lead to a universe that contracts in on itself in a [...] "Big Crunch", or that there may even be a dark <b>energy</b> <b>cycle,</b> which implies a cyclic model of the universe in which every iteration (Big Bang then eventually a Big Crunch) takes about a trillion (1012) years.

50|$|A thermosonic bond {{falls in}} the {{category}} of a solid state metallic bond which is formed by mating two metal surfaces well below their respective melting points. Coucoulas introduced Thermosonic bonding which significantly improved upon the bond-reliability produced by available commercial solid-state bonding machines where he pre-heated the lead wire (and/or metallized silicon chip) prior to introducing the ultrasonic <b>energy</b> <b>cycle.</b> In addition to thermal softening the lead wire, the subsequent delivery of ultrasonic energy produced further softening by interacting at the atomic lattice level of the heated wire (known as ultrasonic softening). These two independent softening mechanisms (pre-heating lead wire and deliverying the ultrasonic energy at the atomic lattice level) eliminated the incidences of cracking the fragile and costly silicon chip which were observed by Coucoulas when using earlier commercially available solid-state bonding machines. The improvement occurs because pre-heating and ultrasonic softening the lead-wire dramatically facilitated its deformation in forming the required contact area while using a relatively low set of bonding parameters. Depending on the temperature level and material properties of the lead wire, the onset of recrystallization (metallurgy) or hot working of the deforming wire can occur while it is forming the required contact area. Recrystallization takes place in the strain hardening region of the lead wire where it aids in the softening effect. If the wire was ultrasonically deformed at room temperature, it would tend to extensively strain hardened (cold working) and therefore tend to transmit damaging mechanical stresses to the silicon chip. Thermosonic bonding, initially referred to as Hot Work Ultrasonic Bonding by Alexander Coucoulas, was found to bond a wide range of conductive metals such as aluminum and copper wires to tantalum and palladium thin films deposited on aluminum oxide and glass substrates all of which simulated the metallized silicon chip.|$|E
