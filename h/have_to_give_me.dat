500|$|Wellman {{frequently}} {{conflicted with}} the military officers brought in to supervise the picture, especially the infantry commander whom he considered to have [...] "two monumental hatreds: fliers and movie people". After one argument Wellman retorted to the commander, [...] "You're just a goddamn fool because the government has told me you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> all your men and do just exactly what I want you to do." [...] Although Wellman {{paid much attention to}} technical details in shooting, he used cars and clothing of the year during the filming, forgetting to use those of World War I. He took six weeks to fully edit the film and prepare it for release.|$|E
2500|$|By 1959 {{there were}} {{chapters}} of the DOB in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Rhode Island along with the original chapter in San Francisco. Upon arrival at a meeting, attendees would be greeted at the door. [...] In a show of good faith, the greeter would say, [...] "I'm ---. Who are you? You don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> your real name, not even your real first name." ...|$|E

[...] In 1733, he noted the rarity {{in a letter to}} Gabburri: [...] "For my part I can encourage you to acquire a portrait of the reigning king and the queen, but the one engraved by Drevet is very difficult to have, and I have it Seen for sale at more than eight livres. I can have it for a discreet price but I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> time." ...|$|E

She got the hare, but she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a kiss for it; AND THAT GIRL WAS THE PRINCESS. Isn't that true?' said he, looking at her.|$|R

2500|$|In the 1946 Christmas episode, for example, Benny buys {{shoelaces}} for Don, and {{is unable}} to {{make up his mind}} whether to give Wilson shoelaces with plastic tips or metal tips. After exchanging them repeatedly, Mel Blanc is heard screaming insanely, [...] "Plastic tips! Metal tips! I can't stand it anymore!" [...] A variation in 1948 was with an expensive wallet, but repeatedly changing the greeting card, prompting Blanc to shout, [...] "I haven't run into anyone like you in 20 years! Oh, why did the governor <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> that pardon!?" [...] Benny then realizes that he should have gotten Don a wallet for $1.98, whereupon the store clerk responds by committing suicide. Over the years, in the Christmas episodes, Benny bought and repeatedly exchanged cuff links, golf tees, a box of dates, a paint set (water colors or oils), and a gopher trap. In later years, Benny would encounter Mel Blanc's wife (played by Jean Vander Pyl) or the clerk's psychiatrist at the store, and drive them crazy as well.|$|E

[...] "First of all she made me think you was dead; then I thought you was all dead—give me such a turn they <b>’ad</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> brandy <b>to</b> bring me round. When I found out it was only Jemmy’s finger, I was nearly off my ’ed with joy." ...|$|R

I never had spring {{training}} 1946 and I pinch hit in Pittsburgh in my first game, then I got into the starting lineup. In my second game in left field, I hit a bases loaded double to beat the Pirates. A few days later in Chicago against the Cubs, I hit two homers in one game" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Come {{and play}} me a game, Wolf," [...] {{he cried out}} cheerfully. [...] "You'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a few, I'm so out of practice. We'll make it a hundred, and you shall give me twenty. Which will you have, spot, or plain?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, {{recovering}} himself, [...] "luck {{is indeed}} against me. But never mind. Let's have a drink, Lantry; you'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it <b>me</b> on credit this time!" ...|$|R

Oh, he {{is always}} pleased to feel he can do like other people," [...] {{returned}} Bessie, [...] "and I'll undertake {{to see that he}} puts the ring on the right--I mean the left finger.

6000|$|... "No," [...] Charlotte said, {{surprisingly}} {{initiative in}} these junctures, [...] "I don't {{know how it}} is in Mr. Vanecken's church, but, if father doesn't come, perhaps you'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> away.

His daddy ain’t <b>had</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him. The only thing my daddy <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> was that piano. And he died over <b>giving</b> <b>me</b> that.

6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} have, then," [...] said Robert, severely. [...] "I {{had no idea}} it was so bad.

Or perhaps Miss Hartley will; she seems to be all right, so far as the theory of the thing goes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Set them up again. I want a {{drink to}} pass the time," [...] he said. [...] "I'll play you at {{anything}} you like to put a name to, boys, if this game don't suit you, but you'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> the chance of making my hotel bill. In my country I've seen folks livelier at a funeral." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, cap'n," [...] {{returned}} the sea cook, sitting {{down as he}} was bidden on the sand, [...] "you'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a hand up again, that's all. A sweet pretty place you have of it here.--Ah, there's Jim! The top of the morning to you, Jim.--Doctor, here's my service.

6000|$|... "None: your servant gave us {{your kind}} message; {{and as for}} the carriage, it was too delightful. Colonel Campian was so; pleased with it, that he <b>has</b> promised <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> one, with your permission, exactly the same." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY BRITOMART. Well, you surely didn't suppose your {{grandfather}} <b>had</b> anything <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me.</b> The Stevenages {{could not do}} everything for you.

6000|$|... "Go!" [...] {{cried the}} Demon, [...] "I shall not go until I {{have done all}} that I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do. <b>Give</b> <b>me</b> work, or I shall wring your neck." [...] And his fingers began to twitch.|$|R
6000|$|... 'This {{must be the}} wood,' {{she said}} thoughtfully to herself, 'where things have no names. I wonder what'll become of MY name when I go in? I shouldn't like to lose it at all--because they'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> another, {{and it would be}} almost certain to be an ugly one. But then the fun would be trying to find the {{creature}} that had got my old name! That's just like the advertisements, you know, when people lose dogs--"ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF 'DASH:' HAD ON A BRASS COLLAR"--just fancy calling everything you met [...] "Alice," [...] till one of them answered! Only they wouldn't answer at all, if they were wise.' ...|$|E
60|$|The woman I fixed my eye on, was {{the woman}} who kept house for me at my cottage. Her name was Selina Goby. I agree with the late William Cobbett about picking a wife. See that she chews her food well and sets her foot down firmly on the ground when she walks, and you're all right. Selina Goby was all right in both these respects, which was one reason for marrying her. I had another reason, likewise, entirely of my own discovering. Selina, being a single woman, made me pay so much a week for her board and {{services}}. Selina, being my wife, couldn't charge for her board, and would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> her services for nothing. That {{was the point of}} view I looked at it from. Economy--with a dash of love. I put it to my mistress, as in duty bound, just as I had put it to myself.|$|E
6000|$|I have {{no doubt}} the young people knelt before their parents, as was the fashion in those days; and am {{perfectly}} certain that Mrs. Lambert kissed both of them, and likewise bedewed her pocket-handkerchief in the most plentiful manner. Hetty was not present at this sentimental scene, and when she heard of it, spoke with considerable asperity, and a laugh that {{was by no means}} pleasant, saying: [...] "Is this all the news you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me?</b> Why, I have known it these months past. Do you think I have no eyes to see, and no ears to hear, indeed?" [...] But in private she was much more gentle. She flung herself on her sister's neck, embracing her passionately, and vowing that never, never would Theo find any one to love her like her sister. With Theo she became entirely mild and humble. She could not abstain from her jokes and satire with George, but he was too happy to heed her much, and too generous not to see the cause of her jealousy.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, sir, I will {{undertake}} that. There is {{no fear of}} my {{letting him}} know that the child has gone, for I don't know where to write him; and if he or the other should come down, if I am here I shall have no difficulty in keeping it from him that the child has gone, for my man has {{never set foot in}} this house. He just meets me on the road near Pitsea, says what he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say, and <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> what he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me,</b> and then drives off again. Of course, if I am summoned as a witness, I know that the law can make me go. I remember now that when he <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> the child he said he was doing it to oblige a friend of his, and he may be able to prove that he <b>had</b> nothing <b>to</b> do with carrying it off." ...|$|R
50|$|The novel travels {{chronologically}} {{through each}} month and location along the Trail of Tears. Glancy taps into an emotional and horrific, but historically accurate {{account of what}} many now refer to as Indian genocide. In an interview with Jennifer Andrews for the American Indian Quarterly, Glancy tells Andrews that “the land <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> permission <b>to</b> write. The ancestors <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> permission <b>to</b> write, too. For instance, I started off Pushing the Bear with one voice, and it wasn’t enough. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go back and add her husband and everybody who had traveled {{with them on the}} Trail of Tears. It takes many voices to tell a story, and I think we carry those voices within us” (Andrews 651).|$|R
