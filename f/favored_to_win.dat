5|$|Gay {{made his}} track return in Beijing but his injury had reduced his 100m medal chances and Bolt and Powell were more <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the event. The much {{anticipated}} Gay, Bolt and Powell final never materialised, however, as Gay failed to qualify in the semi-finals. Finishing fifth after recording 10.05s, Gay {{denied that he}} was still injured, but claimed the hamstring problem had upset his training schedule.|$|E

The Commodores had their best chance to score when Thomas Ryan beat the defense, but he dropped Neely's pass. Vanderbilt also had a chance to score when a Georgia field goal was blocked by Lynn Bomar and picked up by Tot McCullough, who was caught from behind before he could score.|$|E

Led by coach Frank McGuire and Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year Lennie Rosenbluth, the Tar Heels were ranked first overall in the AP Poll. Kansas came into the National Championship game with two losses, which were credited to poor ball control on the Jayhawks part.

5|$|Alabama {{entered the}} season as {{defending}} national champions, and began the 2010 season as the preseason number one team in both the AP and Coaches' Polls. <b>Favored</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> a second consecutive SEC championship and be in contention for the national championship, the Crimson Tide opened the season with five consecutive victories over San Jose State, Penn State, Duke, Arkansas and Florida. However, Alabama completed the regular season with only nine victories and losses to South Carolina, LSU and Auburn and finished fourth in the Western Division. After the regular season, the Crimson Tide accepted an invitation {{to compete in the}} Capital One Bowl in Orlando.

5|$|Dick Harp was in {{the midst}} of his first season as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game. Kansas came into the season <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the {{national}} title. This was due in large part to Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules. At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the starting line up during the season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E

The game was played on January 1, 2009, and also featured the No. 12 Cincinnati Bearcats, champions of the Big East Conference. Pregame {{media coverage of the}} game focused {{on the fact that the}} 2009 Orange Bowl was Cincinnati's first Bowl Championship Series game in school history, and despite their bowl-game inexperience, the Bearcats were <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> by two and a half points on the eve of the game.|$|E

Despite their appearance in the previous year's national championship game, the Seminoles were ranked as the No. 5 team {{in the country in}} the USA Today college football preseason poll. Florida State, which had a 702 record in Atlantic Coast Conference games since joining the conference, was again <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the ACC, but the Seminoles faced challenges replacing Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Chris Weinke and 14 other starters from the previous year's team. Adding to the Seminoles' challenges in the 2001 season was the loss of two starting wide receivers: Robert Morgan and Anquan Boldin, both of whom suffered season-ending injuries before {{the first game of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|Nebraska {{was heavily}} <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the contest, {{as the point}} spread favored Nebraska by 16 points to 17 points.

Virginia Tech, meanwhile, had a bowl streak dating back just three years, to the 1993 Independence Bowl, and while the game was Nebraska's 16th Orange Bowl, it was Virginia Tech's first. Nebraska and Virginia Tech were among the winningest seven teams in Division I-A college football during the two seasons prior to the Orange Bowl. Virginia Tech had 20 wins in those two seasons, while Nebraska had 22 victories.|$|E
5|$|The Florida State/Virginia Tech matchup was the 31st {{game between}} the two teams since they first met in 1955. At the time, Florida State held the {{advantage}} in wins, with a 19101 record against Virginia Tech. Heading into the 2002 Gator Bowl, however, spread bettors predicted a reversal of that trend as Virginia Tech was <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> by two points on Dec. 10. This was reflective of an overall feeling of pessimism toward the Seminoles, who hadn't finished out of {{first place in the}} ACC since joining the league in 1992, and would not participate in the national championship game {{for the first time in}} four years. Because of this decline in stature, the fact that the game was a rematch of the 2000 national championship game received less coverage than it would have otherwise.|$|E
25|$|The Packers were <b>favored</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> {{the game}} by 14 points, largely because many thought the Patriots were a Cinderella team, {{and because of the}} recent {{dominance}} of the NFC in Super Bowl games.|$|E

Comfortably {{ahead in}} the polls, Tunney did not aggressively {{campaign}} until the final weeks before the election.

In addition, Tunney had a high absenteeism rate while serving in the Senate and missed numerous votes. Hayakawa exploited this with a TV ad that showed an empty chair in the US Senate chamber. Hayakawa gradually closed the gap with Tunney, and ultimately defeated him by just over three percentage points.|$|R
