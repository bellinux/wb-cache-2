25|$|An {{airspeed}} indicator is a <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> {{with the pressure}} reading expressed in units of speed, rather than pressure. The airspeed {{is derived from the}} difference between the ram air pressure from the pitot tube, or stagnation pressure, and the static pressure. The pitot tube is mounted facing forward; the static pressure is frequently detected at static ports on one or both sides of the aircraft. Sometimes both pressure sources are combined in a single probe, a pitot-static tube. The static pressure measurement is subject to error due to inability to place the static ports at positions where the pressure is true static pressure at all airspeeds and attitudes. The correction for this error is the position error correction (PEC) and varies for different aircraft and airspeeds. Further errors of 10% or more are common if the airplane is flown in “uncoordinated” flight.|$|E

50|$|This {{experiment}} contained two sealed pressure zones, extending {{along the}} interior {{walls of the}} satellite, which were designed to record the impact of micrometeorites large enough to pierce the satellite shell. These pressure zones were partial vacuums, each at a different pressure, and were protected by 0.66 mm magnesium walls that presented an exposed surface area of 0.162 m², which was 20% of {{the area of the}} shell. A puncture in the walls of either zone was detected by a <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> mounted between them, and telemetered as a change in the length of one of the telemetry channels. Erosion of the satellite shell through bombardment by space dust, micrometeorites, and other particles was recorded by three chromium-strip erosion gauges mounted on the satellite surface, and by a photosensitive detector. Electrical resistances of the gauges changed as their surfaces were changed by erosion. The photosensitive detector, a cadmium sulfide cell protected by an opaque covering of aluminized PET film, also showed a resistance change as the covering was eroded or penetrated. Erosion measurements also were telemetered as channel lengths, which permitted estimates of the erosion rates. Four barium titanate-type microphones recorded micrometeorite impacts on the satellite's surface. The microphone output was amplified, shaped, and fed into a magnetic counter unit, which provided continuously, in three-decimal digits, the cumulative count of impacts. The unit counted up to 1000 and then reset to zero. The satellite recorded 6600 micrometeorite impacts during 66 days of operation, of which 2800 occurred during a 70-h interval from November 16 to 18, 1959. No penetrations or fractures were recorded in the sensors of the surface penetration experiment. Because the erosion sensors were not disrupted, no definite results could be drawn from that experiment.|$|E

Subtracting the tilt noise reduces the vertical channel noise levels by 35 – 40 dB between 1 and 60 mHz on the seafloor sensor and by 15 – 20 dB between 1 and 10 mHz on the borehole sensor. Subtracting the ocean-wave noise further reduces the noise level on all instruments by 5 – 15 dB between 4 and 20 mHz. After subtracting tilt and ocean-wave noise, the seafloor vertical channel is 5 – 10 dB quieter than the buried sensor vertical channel at frequencies below 30 mHz. The corrected borehole vertical channel has a similar noise level to the seafloor and buried sites above 10 mHz, but noise increases rapidly at lower frequencies, probably because of vertical strumming under tidally driven fluid flow...|$|E
40|$|In May 2007, {{within the}} {{monitoring}} activities {{carried out in}} cooperation with the Italian National Civil Protection Department (DPC) and European NERIES project (activity NA 6), INGV has deployed three Broad Band Ocean Bottom Seismometers in the southern Ionian Sea at 3500 / 4000 meters of depth. The OBS’s are equipped with a Nanometrics Trillium 120 p seismometer, a Cox-Webb <b>Differential</b> <b>Pressure</b> <b>Gauge</b> and a 21 bits SEND Geolon-MLS digitizer. The three OBS’s, entirely developed at the Gibilmanna Geophysical Observatory of the INGV National Earthquake Center (CNT), are part of a pool of eight ready to deploy instruments and they are the first Italian OBS’s taking part in a long term experiment: two of them will be recovered by February 2008, whereas the third, in the deep Ionian Sea, will be replaced every year, until May 2010, to accomplish the continuous long-term seismic monitoring task of the EU NERIES project. The area selected for the deployment is a region of high scientific interest for several reasons: i) there are no seismological data on the structure of the Ionian lithosphere; ii) the level and features of the seismicity of the area between the Hyblean-Malta fault system and the accretionary prism of the Calabrian Arc are unknown. This experiment allows us to test the pressure waves detection system that will be implemented in the Tsunami Warning System INGV is developing within the IOC-UNESCO “NEAMTWS” (North-East Atlantic, Mediterranean and connected seas Tsunami Warning System). In this poster we describe the technical features and the performance of the OBS’s, the deployment campaign, and some seismic data recorded...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1989 / Town & Country Hotel & Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaHoneywell, under {{contract}} from NASA Johnson Space Center and Lockheed Engineering and Sciences Company, {{has developed a}} new tool for instrumentation data collection. The Stand-Alone Pressure Measurement Device (SAPMD) {{is part of a}} family of microminiature data recorders combined with sensors that can be be used as flight development instrumentation on aerospace vehicles and structures. NASA came to Honeywell with a need to collect absolute pressure data during ascent of the Shuttle on various points over the orbiter’s surface. Instrumentation for this data does not exist on current orbiters, and NASA must use computer modeling to determine structural loading calculations. The conventional approach of placing sensors and cabling inside the Shuttle’s frame combined with drilling holes for the pressure sensors was considered too costly and could weaken the orbiter’s structure. The SAPMD measures pressure at various locations on the space shuttle orbiter skin during ascent. In order to avoid the extensive impacts associated with wiring new measurements into the orbiter data system, the device is self contained, incorporating its own sensor, power supply, self-starting sensor, nonvolatile memory for sensor data, and a real-time clock for time reference. The device is small enough (6. 28 in x 1. 5 in. x 0. 5 in.) to be mounted under the thermal protection system tiles and rugged enough to withstand the environments encountered at the interface between tiles throughout an orbiter mission. Data recorded during ascent is recovered after the mission without removing the device. Other sensors such as strain gauges for structural monitoring, vibration gauges for wing flutter, or <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> can be used with this hardware...|$|R

40|$|Off East Sicily (at 2100 m depth, 25 km off the harbour of Catania) a {{prototype}} of a cabled deep-sea observatory (NEMO-SN 1) was set up and has been operational in real-time since 2005 (the cabled deep-sea multi-parameter station SN 1, equipped with geophysical and environmental sensors and the cabled NEMO-OνDE, equipped with 4 broadband hydrophones). The Western Ionian Sea {{is one of the}} node sites for the upcoming European permanent underwater network (EMSO). Within the activities of the EC project ESONET-NoE some demonstration missions have been funded. The LIDO-DM (Listening to the Deep Ocean-Demonstration Mission) is one of these and is re- lated to two sites, East Sicily and Iberian Margin (Gulf of Cadiz), the main aims being geo-hazards monitoring and warning (seismic, tsunami, and volcanic) and bio-acoustics. The LIDO-DM East Sicily installation represents a fur- ther major step within ESONET-NoE, resulting in a fully integrated system for multidisciplinary deep-sea science, capable to transmit and distribute data in real time to the scientific community and to the general public. LIDO-DM East Sicily hosts a large number of sensors aimed at monitoring and studying oceanographic and environmental parameters (by means of CTD, ADCP, 3 -C single point current meter, turbidity meter), geophysical phenomena (low frequency hydrophones, accelerometer, gravity meter, vector and scalar magnetometers, seismometer, abso- lute and <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges),</b> ocean noise monitoring and identification and tracking of biological acoustic sources in deep sea. The latter will be performed using two tetrahedral arrays of 4 hydrophones, located at a relative distance of about 5 km, and at about 25 km from the shore. The whole system will be connected and powered from shore, by means of the electro-optical cable net installed at the East Sicily Site Infrastructure, and synchronised with GPS. Sensors data sampling is performed underwater and transmitted via optical fibre link, with optimal S/N ratio for all signals. This will also permit real-time data acquisition, analysis and distribution on-shore. Innova- tive electronics for the off-shore data acquisition and transmission systems has been designed, built and tested. A dedicated computing and networking infrastructure for data acquisition, storage and distribution through the internet has been also created. The deployment and connection of the deep sea structures will be performed using the dedicated ROV and Deep Sea Shuttle handling facilities (PEGASO, owned by INGV and INFN). LIDO-DM constitutes the enhancement of the Western Ionian site in view of the EMSO Research Infrastructure...|$|R
