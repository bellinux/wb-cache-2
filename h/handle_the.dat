5|$|Before {{the opening}} of Melbourne Airport, Melbourne's main airport was Essendon Airport which was officially {{designated}} an international airport in 1950. In the mid-1950s, over 10,000 passengers were using Essendon Airport and the limitations of Essendon Airport were beginning to become apparent. Essendon Airport's facilities were insufficient to meet the increasing demand for air travel; the runways were too short to <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> then new jet airliners and the terminals failed to <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> increase in passengers, by the mid-1950s, an international overflow terminal was built in a new northern hangar. Due to the encroachment of the urban boundary, the airport had become surrounded by residential housing, meaning that expansion of Essendon Airport was not possible.|$|E

5|$|There {{was a short}} boom in 1923, {{after which}} GWR made heavy {{investments}} in adapting the hoists and tips in its docks and sidings to <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> 20-ton wagon, but the collieries were often unwilling to adopt the new size despite offers of rebates.|$|E
5|$|A melancholic Darryl finally assembles {{a conference}} room meeting with several {{potential}} new hires, but utters several discouraging remarks about the job and exits, leaving Andy alone {{to take charge of}} the process.

Darryl blames himself for the failure and demands that Andy fire him, leaving Andy baffled and with no choice but to <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> hiring of new warehouse staff himself.|$|E
5|$|After Lyons began programming, Billings {{started to}} study the video games market. He visited local game stores and {{attended}} a San Francisco gaming convention. Billings approached Tom Shaw from Avalon Hill—the company produced many war games that Billings played as a child—and {{one of the founders}} of Automated Simulations to share market data, but aroused no interest. The lukewarm responses made Billings believe he would have to publish SSI's games. After Computer Bismarck was finished in January 1980, he searched for a graphic designer to <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> game's packaging.|$|E

5|$|After the new Burgundians realise {{they are}} not subject to post-war {{rationing}} or other bureaucratic restrictions, the district is quickly flooded with black marketeers and shoppers; Spiller is unable to <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> rising problems by himself. In response, the British authorities surround the Burgundian territory with barbed wire. The residents retaliate against what they see as heavy-handed bureaucratic action; they stop a London Underground train as it passes through Burgundy, and ask to see passports of all passengers: those without documents are unable to proceed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{hardware}} quirk produced one of {{the most}} distinctive aspects of the ZX81's screen display – during loading or saving, moving zigzag stripes appear across the screen. The same pin on the ULA is used to <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> video signal and the tape output, producing the stripes as an interference pattern of sorts. The ULA cannot maintain the display during SAVE and LOAD operations, as it has to operate continuously to maintain the correct baud rate for data transfers. The interference produces the zigzag stripes.|$|E
5|$|As a {{response}} to the poor reception and claims that the system could not <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> original game, Simon Thomley, who later assisted with the development of the 2013 mobile port, released an unofficial, proof-of-concept version of Sonic the Hedgehog for the system. The unofficial version contains a complete Green Hill Zone and two special stages, as well as Tails and Knuckles as playable characters.|$|E

30|$|In addition, {{the land}} used at both line’s {{seaports}} <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> conventional ships has been different, {{influenced by the}} required number of port berths, and their crane capacity. It has been almost equal in both seaports if <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> mega (ULC) ships. In addition, the land used has been generally greater when <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> conventional ships compared to that when handling their mega (ULC) counterparts.|$|R

Two years later, the CTC approved a Caltrans proposal to revoke the proposed freeway status of the unconstructed portion of SR54 since the existing roads including Jamacha Boulevard would be able to <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> projected traffic load; this would allow the unused land to be sold.|$|E

5|$|Because the hot recycle solids are heated in a {{separate}} furnace, the oil shale gas from these technologies is not diluted with combustion exhaust gas. Another advantage {{is that there is}} no limit on the smallest particles that the retort can process, thus allowing all the crushed feed to be used. One disadvantge is that more water is used to <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> resulting finer shale ash.|$|E

5|$|Between January 2010 and 2015, {{a quarter}} of {{emergency}} room doctors said they had seen a major surge in patients, while nearly half had seen a smaller increase.

The biggest factor in the increased number of ER patients was insufficient primary care providers to <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> larger number of insured patients.|$|E
