25|$|Archeologists {{from the}} University of Arkansas have {{determined}} {{the first people}} to occupy the area were Bluff Dwellers or Rock Shelter Indians. By the artifacts, arrowheads, rock hammers, and crude knives which have been found, they can tell which native peoples were <b>here</b> <b>first.</b> They also note that for each period of time there was a vast improvement in their relics. During this time several families lived together because the caves or shelters under bluffs were larger. These shelters were always near to a clear spring of bubbling water.|$|E
25|$|The {{so-called}} sympathetic Seattle {{strike was}} an attempted revolution. That {{there was no}} violence does not alter the fact... The intent, openly and covertly announced, was for {{the overthrow of the}} industrial system; <b>here</b> <b>first,</b> then everywhere... True, there were no flashing guns, no bombs, no killings. Revolution, I repeat, doesn't need violence. The general strike, as practised in Seattle, is of itself the weapon of revolution, all the more dangerous because quiet. To succeed, it must suspend everything; stop the entire life stream of a community... That is to say, it puts the government out of operation. And that is all there is to revolt–no matter how achieved.|$|E

[...] He was again sent off at prohibitive odds but confirmed the expectations winning by four and a quarter lengths from Empire of Dirt. After the race Walsh said [...] "He jumped better today but there is still room for improvement. He'll keep learning and the only way he'll do that is through racing so that's why Willie wanted to come <b>here</b> <b>first</b> before going for a graded race.

2500|$|At the Convention, Stevenson, as {{governor}} of the host state, was assigned to give the welcoming address to the delegates. His speech was so stirring and witty that it helped stampede his nomination, {{in spite of his}} continued protests that he was not a presidential candidate. In his welcoming speech he poked fun at the 1952 Republican National Convention, which had been held in Chicago in the same coliseum two weeks earlier. Stevenson described the achievements of the Democratic Party under Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, but noted [...] "our Republican friends have said it was all a miserable failure. For almost a week pompous phrases marched over this landscape in search of an idea, and the only idea that they found was that the two great decades of progress...were the misbegotten spawn of bungling, of corruption, of socialism, of mismanagement, of waste and worse...after listening to this everlasting procession of epithets about our [...] misdeeds I was even surprised the next morning when the mail was delivered on time.
