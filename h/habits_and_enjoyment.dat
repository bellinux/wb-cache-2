Studies of unilateral CI (UCI) users' music perception have found that these subjects have little difficulty recognizing tempo and rhythm but great difficulty with pitch, interval and melody. The present study is an initial step towards understanding music perception in bilateral CI (BCI) users. The Munich Music Questionnaire was used to investigate music listening <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> in 23 BCI users compared to 2 control groups: 23 UCI users and 23 normal-hearing (NH) listeners. Bilateral users appeared to have a number of advantages over unilateral users, though their enjoyment of music did not reach the level of NH listeners...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} sleep, television and computer <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> and feelings of tiredness in school of school-age children and adolescents in Sweden. An instrument found to be valid and reliable here was distributed to 3, 011 children aged 6, 7, 10, 14, and 16 years. Those sleeping less than the median length of time reported a significantly lower degree of enjoyment of school. Short sleep was found to be associated with having a bedroom TV, spending more than 2 hr a day at the TV or the computer, being tired in school, and having difficulties both in waking up and in sleeping. Discussing sleep and media habits with schoolchildren and their parents regarding matters of optimal sleep and of how media habits affect sleep and learning is seen to be an important task of the school health service...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} reading comprehension, reading fluency {{and attitudes of}} students after exposure to extensive reading (ER), an approach to teaching and learning foreign languages without using a dictionary or focusing on grammar, but aiming to get learners to read extensively by choosing books on their own, for general comprehension, good reading <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> (Day and Bamford 1998; Prowse 1999). It was conducted in the Thai context with English as foreign language (EFL) students at Rajamangala University of Technology Thanyaburi (RMUTT) in Thailand {{during a period of}} four months, one academic semester. The teaching procedure conformed to the principles of ER with a wide-ranging selection of graded reader books. Multiple measurements used to assess comprehension with three narrative texts were written recall protocol, and translation tests; multiple choice questions with twelve texts in timed reading to assess reading fluency; and a survey questionnaire as well as an in-depth interview to gather data on attitudes towards extensive reading. The study employed a double-control pre- and post-test (Solomon) design: two experimental groups (N = 52 and 50) and four control groups (N = 46, 48, 42, and 46) of which two are excluded from the pretest to separate out the effects caused by using the same instruments. The findings suggest positive effects of ER on the learners’ reading comprehension and provide conclusive evidence of reading fluency improvement together with a positive attitude towards ER. The study also revealed that credit or score is a key factor to encourage students to read and they preferred reading in a controlled situation in class including taking the tests of timed reading. The thesis discusses the possibility of using testing as a pedagogical tool for the improvement of reading skills. Implications drawn from the findings suggest that in order to maximize the benefits of ER, an adjustment of procedures is essential prior to the integration with language courses in the Thai and other similar contexts.

Based on the Manifesto IFLA/UNESCO (2000) which emphasizes that objective of the school library to develop the <b>habit</b> <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> of reading, not only as a supplement to formal place in the classroom, but also working in a dynamic and interactive context, providing free access to books, literature, and entertaining read, without further evaluation, for the simple pleasure of discovering the world of dreams and imaginary. It is considered that the school library falls as the ideal environment to stimulate the practice of reading the simple pleasure of interacting with the book of literature, because is not included in the educational requirements of the law with respect to curriculum, course class hours, etc. So should make use of innovative strategies and playful activities with the children and teenagers literary text.

Trained school nurses measured the weight and height of 2891 children aged 6, 7, 10, 14, and 16, and distributed a questionnaire to them regarding television <b>and</b> computer <b>habits,</b> sleep, <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> of school. Overweight, obesity included, was present in 16. 1 % of the study population. Relationships between lifestyle factors and overweight were studied using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Having a bedroom television and spending more than 2 [*]h a day watching television were found to be associated with overweight (OR 1. 26 and 1. 55 respectively). No association was found between overweight and time spent at the computer, short sleep duration, enjoyment of school, tiredness at school, or difficulties in sleeping and waking up.

40|$|Introduction and Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore beliefs about tobacco {{dependence}} treatment from the perspective of staff and clients in addiction treatment settings. Design and Methods: A qualitative study was conducted between August and November 2013 using grounded theory methodology. Participants were recruited from four government-funded drug and alcohol services in a regional centre of New South Wales, Australia. Treatment centre staff (n= 10) were interviewed using a semistructured interview guide and two focus groups (n= 5 and n= 6) were held with clients of the same treatment centres. Results: Both clients and staff wish to do more about tobacco use in addiction treatment services, but a number of barriers were identified. Staff barriers included lack of time, tobacco-permissive organisational culture, lack of enforcement of smoke-free policies, beliefs that tobacco is not a treatment priority for clients and that clients need to smoke as a coping strategy, and perceptions that treatment was either ineffective or not used by clients. Clients reported smoking as a <b>habit</b> <b>and</b> for <b>enjoyment</b> or stress relief, seeing staff smoking, nicotine replacement therapy unaffordability and perceptions that nicotine replacement therapy may be addictive, and inability to relate to telephone cessation counselling as barriers to quitting smoking. Discussion and Conclusions: Client and staff perceptions and attitudes about the treatment of tobacco, particularly those relating telephone support and nicotine replacement therapy, provided information, which will inform the design of smoking cessation programs for addiction treatment populations...|$|R

But a film had suddenly past from before his senses; and, a man of mere <b>habits,</b> prejudices, <b>and</b> animal <b>enjoyments,</b> he had awakened at the very termination of his brief existence to something like a consciousness of his true position in the moral world, as well as of his real physical condition. Under the first impulse of such an alarm, John Effingham had been sent for; and he, as has been seen, ordered Captain Truck to be summoned. In consequence of the previous understanding these two gentlemen and Mr. Leach appeared at the state-room door at the same instant.

40|$|Introduction Children’s {{physical}} inactivity has dramatically escalated in Europe {{over the past}} 20 years and Italy {{is one of the}} countries with higher rate of sedentary or insufficiently active children. Low levels of physical activity (PA) <b>and</b> poor movement <b>habits</b> are main contributors for different pathologies and {{there has never been a}} more urgent need for effective programmes to reduce sedentariness as now (Salmon et al., 2009). Reviews of PA interventions reported that the most effective strategies among children include both focus on school and on family strategies. Quality physical education, active breaks, active leisure activities, social and parental support are key-elements to modify physical habits in children. The aim of this study was to explore the associations of parental and classroom teachers physical <b>habits,</b> given support <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> in PA, with children PA levels, perceived support <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment.</b> Method Participants were 282 children at grade 4 of primary school in Northeast Italy, their 564 parents and 37 classroom teachers. Three batteries of questionnaires were used, including: the Parental Support Scale (Trost et al., 2003), the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children (Crocker et al., 1997), the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (Kendzierski & De Carlo, 1991, Carraro et al., 2008) and the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (Taylor et al., 1978). Demographic and socio-economical variables were collected. Results Significant associations (p <. 05) were found. Variables that were consistently associated with children PA were sex (male), previous PA and sport practice, support <b>and</b> perceived <b>enjoyment</b> in PA practice. Discussion This was the first study of parents’ and teachers’ influences on children’s PA carried out in Italy, data partially confirmed findings of previous research made in different cultural contexts(Sallis et al., 2000). Results should be confirmed in prospective studies, and interventions to improve the modifiable variables should be developed and evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Drinking low-sugar kills {{your brain}} cells and stuff…” Lay conceptions in home {{economics}} The {{objective of the}} study was to investigate how 15 -year-old students understand different aspects of the following main topics: 1) eating <b>habits</b> <b>and</b> the <b>enjoyment</b> of food <b>and</b> 2) health and lifestyle. The two topics are related to everyday lifestyle as well as to the students' work in home economics during their 10 years of compulsory schooling. The study had a phenomenographic design, and was conducted using four focus groups. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and the analysis was carried out in an iterative manner on those transcripts. The variation of understanding among the students is characterized in a set of ten categories of description: •	there is a connection between the sugar content and particular properties of the foodstuff •	the marketing on the packaging says something about the sugar content •	the perception of the foodstuff as healthy or unhealthy says something about its sugar content •	artificial sweeteners are sugar substitutes, and they therefore have the same effect on the body as sugar •	artificial sweeteners and sugar have different effects on the body •	sugar has an impact on the psyche •	sugar may lead to physical health problems/ illness •	sugar does not affect the energy intake •	fruit and vegetables are necessary for the body •	fruit and vegetables are not harmful to the body There are lay conceptions within all these categories of description. For students to have the best possible starting point for studying home economics, it is important that teachers are aware of their students' lay conceptions. In a social constructivist perspective on learning it is natural to assume that lay conceptions are of significance when students choose foodstuffs, and thus contribute to forming the basis for future lifestyle patterns...|$|R
40|$|Identifying {{modifiable}} {{factors associated}} with physical activity (PA) is necessary to develop effective behaviour change interventions to promote PA. We examined the associations between parental support, parental control, youth’s self-efficacy, <b>enjoyment,</b> <b>and</b> PA participation in- and out-of-school. Data for our cross-sectional study were collected via self-report questionnaires from 602 youth (Mage= 13. 4 years; SD=. 6) and analyzed using path analysis. We found that parental support and parental control indirectly influenced youth’s PA via self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment.</b> Specifically, parental control negatively influenced youth’s self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> (β=-. 12 to -. 15), whereas parental support positively influenced youth’s self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> (β=. 18 to. 31). Also, youth’s self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> positively influenced PA performed in- and out-of-school (β=. 12 to. 26). Our findings suggest parental supportive and controlling behaviours affect youth’s self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment,</b> which in turn influence PA participation in different settings. Promoting parental support, while reducing parental control, may effectively increase youth’s participation in PA...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{exploration}} of the literature has shown that fun <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> are often discussed {{in relation to the}} learning of children and older adults and are rarely mentioned in relation to the learning of adults. This paper explores the role that fun <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> plays in adult learning programs and the impact that this has on an adults learning. The focus is on data gathered in 2012 from interviews with adult learners and their teachers in Victoria, Australia. These conversations found that both groups could identify the fun <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> in their adult learning experience. The findings have been analysed firstly as an overall experience, with adult learners talking more freely about fun <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> <b>and</b> teachers talking about engagement, social relationships and safety. Learners identified a number of elements that are part of their experience of fun and enjoyment: the activities they undertake, the process established by the teachers, interacting with others, humour, achievement, their emotions and well-being and personal benefits. Both adult learners and their teachers also believed that fun <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> impacted on adults learning {{and they were able to}} articulate the role that fun <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> plays in adult learning programs. Firstly both having fun <b>and</b> experiencing <b>enjoyment</b> were perceived by both learners and teachers as a motivator to attend classes and learn the knowledge and skills. Secondly fun <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> were considered a mechanism that encouraged concentration by learners and helped in the absorption of learning. Finally having fun <b>and</b> experiencing <b>enjoyment</b> were identified as a proven way to build a socially connected learning environment. The research indicates that a greater focus on the affective domain of adults learning experience, in particular fun <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> could prove to be as beneficial and important as it is currently considered in children's learning. A different approach to the design of adult learning experiences and methods that incorporates greater use of fun may mean that more adults are encouraged and motivated to participate in learning with enthusiasm for the journey and optimism for the outcomes...|$|R

40|$|As online games grow in {{importance}} as an electronic commerce application, researchers and practitioners increasingly believe that understanding online game player behavior {{is critical to}} the success of online game vendors. In an attempt to gain new insights into the determinants of behavioral intention to play online games, we propose a theoretical model that augments the theory of reasoned action (TRA) with two new constructs, trust <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment.</b> Within the model framework, we investigate the impact of trust <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> on behavioral intention as well as on behavioral attitude. Our proposed model is tested by using questionnaire responses of 253 online game players. As hypothesized, attitude, <b>enjoyment,</b> <b>and</b> subjective norms predict intention, <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> significantly affects attitude. The results also show that trust affects intention only indirectly through attitude.
