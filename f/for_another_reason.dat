5|$|This {{hurricane}} was {{the only}} usage of the name Fico. The name Fico was removed after this storm and replaced with Fabio in the 1982 season. It is unknown whether it was retired due to its damage or <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>reason.</b> Other possible reasons listed {{for the removal of}} a name are pronunciation ambiguity, a socially unacceptable meaning in another language, or because the storm name represented a significant human disaster.|$|E

25|$|Aphids passively feed on sap of phloem {{vessels in}} plants, {{as do many}} of their fellow members of Hemiptera such as scale insects and cicadas. Once a phloem vessel is punctured, the sap, which is under pressure, is forced into the aphid's food canal. Occasionally, aphids also ingest xylem sap, which is a more dilute diet than phloem sap as the {{concentrations}} of sugars and amino acids are 1% {{of those in the}} phloem. Xylem sap is under negative hydrostatic pressure and requires active sucking, suggesting an important role in aphid physiology. As xylem sap ingestion has been observed following a dehydration period, aphids are thought to consume xylem sap to replenish their water balance; the consumption of the dilute sap of xylem permitting aphids to rehydrate. However, recent data showed aphids consume more xylem sap than expected and they notably do so when they are not dehydrated and when their fecundity decreases. This suggests aphids, and potentially, all the phloem-sap feeding species of the order Hemiptera, consume xylem sap <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> than replenishing water balance.|$|E
500|$|The {{secondary}} plot line, {{about the}} auditions for New Directions soloist at Nationals, was roundly criticized. Canning {{called it a}} [...] "faux drama", though he added that Jesse was [...] "a delight to despise", and VanDerWerff said it was [...] "completely ridiculous {{to do this with}} Nationals coming up" [...] in a week's time, and [...] "constructed almost entirely" [...] to make Jesse a [...] "jerk". Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson also hit on the lack of preparation for the upcoming competition and stated that it seemed [...] "like a very bad idea" [...] to be going without a setlist already decided on, much less with songs unwritten. He said the four audition numbers were [...] "awkwardly paced", though he thought they were [...] "fantastic"; Reiter said they [...] "stood out like glinting gems in a somewhat muddy episode". Canning and VanDerWerff also criticized the block of four songs {{in the middle of the}} episode which, as VanDerWerff put it, [...] "stops the show cold". James Poniewozik of Time was unhappy <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> altogether: [...] "Having four people stand up and sing solos into a microphone may be music; but it ain't a musical." ...|$|E
50|$|This {{short-lived}} peace-treaty is also remarkable <b>for</b> quite <b>another</b> <b>reason.</b> Three {{days before}} its signing, Prussian queen Louise (1776-1810) {{tried to persuade}} Napoleon in a private conversation to ease his hard conditions on Prussia. Though unsuccessful, Louise's effort greatly endeared her to the Prussian people.|$|R

25|$|With the {{addition}} of the Saturday Night Football game on ABC in 2006, GameDay has increasingly aired from that game. This could be done for many reasons including the fact Kirk Herbstreit is on both programs, thus making it easier <b>for</b> him. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> could be to give the Saturday Night Football game added exposure.|$|R
500|$|Lasting {{until the}} final day without ever being kicked out or leaving <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> is treated as an {{impressive}} feat on the series due {{to the level of}} violence and hostility. If the cast members engage in violence towards each other or break other rules, {{they may or may not}} be evicted under the show's policy, which is enforced by the producers. Security guards apparently live in the house behind the scenes as they jump into camera shot to break up the many violent altercations that break out on the series. Beyond the common occurrence of violence and combat, other reasons for the premature exits of cast members have been from bullying, ostracism and alienation from the rest of the housemates, problems at home, court proceedings, or their own narcissism. On some occasions, multiple [...] "bad girls" [...] may wish to leave the show; this has happened in all seasons. If a [...] "bad girl" [...] departs early in the season, a [...] "replacement Bad Girl" [...] is introduced within one or two episodes. The replacement housemate is commonly hazed, aggressed at, and treated with prejudice.|$|E
500|$|Both Ruby and Brax decide Charlie's {{ventilator}} {{should be}} turned off as {{there is nothing more}} the doctors can do for her and Charlie dies. Speaking about her character's exit storyline, Anderson said [...] "When I read the final script for Charlie's exit, I made sure I was in the privacy of my own home. It was written really well – it was a tragic love story and I hope the fans like it." [...] The actress explained that the storyline was great and the writers had done a brilliant job with Charlie and Brax. She also said some fans would be disappointed that the couple did not end up together. Anderson revealed that the series producer had told her that after investing so much in getting Charlie together with Brax, she would not have left the Bay <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> and killing her off was the best way. Of her reaction to the storyline, Anderson said [...] "I started sobbing! But that was the initial shock. You play this character {{for three and a half}} years and you really empathise with them. You have to love a part of them – it's a little extension of you. So it's just so final, the death. But once I had time to let it sink in, now I'm really, really happy with the ending. It's very dramatic and it's definitely going out with a bang, so to speak!" [...] Anderson departed on screen on 24 January 2012.|$|E

50|$|A few {{kilometres}} east of Mount Petrie is the Leslie Harrison Dam. This {{places the}} large {{hill in the}} catchment area <b>for</b> Redland City, <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> that development has been curtailed {{in this part of}} the city.|$|R
50|$|Samnang Samnang stopped writing around 2014. This {{was due to}} her {{not being}} able to get a {{publishing}} deal that would allow her to write <b>for</b> Khmer readers. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> was because of problems with copyright violations.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{transgender}} and transsexual people {{dislike the}} term sexual minority <b>for</b> yet <b>another</b> <b>reason.</b> They {{argue that the}} phenomenon of transsexuality or transgender {{has nothing to do}} with sex, sexual practices or sexual orientation, but it relates to the gender, gender dysphoria and gender-variant behavior or feelings. Thus, they feel it is incorrect to classify them as [...] "sexual minority", when, in fact, they are gender-variant minority.|$|R
2500|$|The {{suicide attempt}} worried prison {{officials}} <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>reason,</b> too. Powell allegedly {{could not remember}} what state or country {{he had been born}} in, nor his age. Military personnel became concerned that he was insane, or was being driven mad by his confinement. Three physicians were called in to determine his sanity, and on June 17 he was interviewed for 3 hours and 40 minutes by Major Thomas Akaryote and Dr. John T. Gray. (The military tribunal later ruled him sane.) ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{inspection}} of the National Community Christmas Tree in 1929 found that the tree had been severely damaged by the decoration process and the heat and weight of the lights. Amawalk nurseries again donated a living tree, this one a [...] tall Norway spruce. It was planted on May 29, 1929. The year 1929 was special in other ways, too. It {{was the first time}} that Christmas tree decorations (not just lights) were placed on the tree. To prevent the tree from being damaged during decoration, scaffolding was erected around the tree (instead of ladders placed into the branches), lighter strings of lights were used, lights with a lower wattage were employed, and a low fence erected around the tree so that its roots would not be trampled. Although much of the Christmas choral and music program remained unchanged (the ceremony reverted to its 6:00 P.M. time again), the 1929 event was notable <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> as well. [...] That evening, as President Herbert Hoover and Mrs. Lou Henry Hoover entertained children from the local community, a fire broke out in the West Wing of the White House. [...] While Mrs. Hoover quietly moved the children into the East Wing and safety, the President and other men rushed into the West Wing where they retrieved furniture, files, historic items, important papers, Hoover's personal effects, and even a puppy (being given as a gift to one of the children). The West Wing (including the Oval Office) was gutted and had to be rebuilt.|$|E
2500|$|After Alfie {{returns from}} Germany, Jean {{tells him to}} buy scented candles as Kat used one while he was away. He asks Kat where she got it from and she lies that {{it was from the}} local shop but he discovers they do not sell them. He then finds out Kat closed the pub early one night because it was [...] "quiet" [...] but worries it may have been <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>reason.</b> He then finds the ring that Kat pawned and asks Jean if she or Charlie lent Kat money, but they did not, and the {{pawnbroker}} refuses to tell him who bought it. The next day, he is suspicious when Kat leaves the pub and tells Michael that she is untrustworthy. Michael says Kat would not cheat again, revealing he knew about the affair, but he does not know who Kat was seeing. Alfie is in turmoil when Michael advises him not to pursue his suspicions. Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) finds a key on the bar and leaves it in a glass, but Alfie later notices it has gone. As he hides a Christmas present in Kat's jewellery box, he finds the key hidden there with the ring. He then leaves, claiming he will be away overnight, and asks Jean and Roxy to look after the bar so Kat can have the night off. Roxy tells the three Branning brothers that Alfie is away, and shortly after, Kat receives a phone call. She heads out, unaware that Alfie is watching. Alfie watches Kat enter the bedsit and kicks the door open, where he sees lit candles and rose petals. He looks for Kat's lover but she is alone. He demands to know who she is seeing, reminding her that she claimed her lover lived miles away. Kat insists this was her only lie and says the affair is over but her lover kept pestering her and threatening to tell Alfie. Alfie brings out Kat's mother's ring and asks how her lover knew about it if she had not seen him. Kat reveals she had not seen him alone, so Alfie realises it is someone he knows. Alfie decides to stay until he arrives, but then sees a rental agreement. Kat quickly sets fire to it, but Alfie sees the name Mr Branning. She tells Alfie she refused to let the man in while he was in Germany, and refuses to reveal which brother it is. Alfie says she makes him sick and goes to The Queen Victoria to find out the truth. While Kat searches for her phone in the bedsit, all three Branning brothers deny everything to Alfie. Kat then phones one of them and Alfie answers. Kat panics and runs to the pub. Alfie then returns the phone to its owner, Max, and attacks him. Kat stops Alfie, saying he has the wrong person. Alfie asks who it is, and Kat points at a smug Derek.|$|E
