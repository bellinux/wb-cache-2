Using a lighter <b>for</b> <b>sight,</b> {{he sees the}} remains of other creatures, and is then eaten by the creature off screen. Meanwhile, Walter (John Noble) investigates Olivia's (Anna Torv) car crash from the previous episode. He believes she traveled to a parallel universe {{that is similar to}} theirs, but she still cannot remember with whom she met with, or why.|$|E
5|$|Nightjars have {{relatively}} large eyes, {{each with a}} tapetum lucidum (reflective layer behind the retina) that makes the eyes shine in torchlight and improves light detection at dusk, dawn and in moonlight. The retinas of nocturnal birds, including nightjars, are adapted <b>for</b> <b>sight</b> in low-light levels and have a higher density of rod cells and far fewer cone cells compared to those of most diurnal birds. These adaptations favour good night vision {{at the expense of}} colour discrimination. In many day-flying species, light passes through coloured oil droplets within the cone cells to improve colour vision. In contrast, nightjars have a limited number of cone cells, either lacking or having only a few oil droplets. The nocturnal eyesight of nightjars is probably equivalent to that of owls. Although they have good hearing, European nightjars appear not to rely on sound to find insects, and nightjars do not echolocate.|$|E

500|$|The acting {{was also}} praised {{by many of}} the critics; Lejeune thought that [...] "the acting of the countless small {{character}} parts that the plot brings together is splendid", while the reviewer for The Monthly Film Bulletin considered that [...] "each character, and indeed every individual member of the lengthy cast, provides a gem of comedy acting at its highest and best". The Manchester Guardian reviewer was critical about aspects of the direction which, it was said, was undertaken [...] "with barely sufficient skill to sustain the fun". The critic Henry Raynor, writing <b>for</b> <b>Sight</b> and Sound, thought that the film [...] "sacrificed a comic enquiry into motives and personality to a farcical romp... It was carried through, not by wit or polish, but by a sometimes hysterical jollity".|$|E
500|$|Critics warmly praised Whisky Galore! on its release. The {{reviewer}} C. A. Lejeune, {{writing in}} The Observer, considered it [...] "a film with the French genius in the British manner", while the reviewer for The Manchester Guardian thought {{the film was}} [...] "put together with... tact and subtlety", and Henry Raynor, in his review <b>for</b> <b>Sight</b> & Sound magazine, called it [...] "one of the best post-war British films". Several critics identified the script as excellent, and the reviewer for The Manchester Guardian thought that the main credit for the film {{should be given to}} Mackenzie and MacPhail for the story. Lejeune thought that the story was treated [...] "with the sort of fancy that is half childlike and half agelessly wise: it accepts facts for what they are, and only tilts their representation, ever so slightly, towards the fantastic and the humorous".|$|E
500|$|Postmodern {{cultural}} critic bell hooks {{cited the}} interaction in the Memphis train station between Thomas and the Japanese couple {{as one of}} the few examples of nuanced, deconstructive and subversive treatment of blackness in American film. In his original review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert proclaimed that [...] "he best thing about Mystery Train is that it takes you to an America you feel you ought to be able to find for yourself, if you only knew where to look." [...] He later included the movie in his Great Movies collection, comparing the movie favorably to Jarmusch's later efforts like Dead Man and The Limits of Control. In an April 2000 retrospective of Jarmusch's work <b>for</b> <b>Sight</b> & Sound, Shawn Levy concluded that the film was [...] "as much a valentine to the allure of the American way of pop culture as it is a cheeky bit of structural legerdemain without terribly much resonating significance".|$|E

500|$|Michael Atkinson, writing <b>for</b> <b>Sight</b> & Sound, {{reviewed}} Aronofsky's endeavor, [...] "It's {{difficult to}} recall another American film that, in pursuing a passionate and personal vision, goes so maddeningly, uproariously wrong." [...] Atkinson {{said of the}} narrative, [...] "The erratic and pointless leapfrogging between its storylines is torporific... all three stories are assembled piecemeal, many of which repeat over and over as flashback and flashforwards." [...] He complained of the numerous motifs, [...] "It's difficult to swallow the amalgamation of Mayan, Biblical, Buddhist, Taoist and New Age iconography, all of it tossed as if into a stew." [...] In contrast, Glenn Kenny of Premiere wrote of the film, [...] "The Fountain is probably the deftest stories-within-stories narrative film I've seen... By The Fountains end, the multilayered meta-narrative... resolves (or does it?) {{into a kind of}} diegetic Möbius strip, to stunning effect." [...] Kenny called the film [...] "as demanding as it is dazzling" [...] and compared Aronofsky's direction to Stanley Kubrick's [...] "in terms of conceptual audacity and meticulousness of execution." [...] He concluded, [...] "It's a movie that's as deeply felt as it is imagined." ...|$|E
500|$|Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network {{declined}} to post {{commentary on the}} preview announcement for the second season, claiming [...] "we assume if you loved School Rumble, you're gonna check out the sequel regardless of what anyone says, so why bother reviewing it?" [...] David F. Smith from IGN gave {{the first part of}} season two a rating of 6/10, with lower scores for the Funimation extras and higher ones for the plot and story. Specifically, Smith praised the anime for never taking itself seriously, and the studio for not cutting its budget <b>for</b> <b>sight</b> gags—something he notes that other companies do. Tim Jones from THEM Anime Reviews found the second season funny and nonrepetitive, and Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network praised the second season for not conforming to the conventions of reality. She complimented it for focusing more on the other students and their relationships than on the main love triangle. Chris Beveridge claimed that, although it comes across well, the season should not be watched in a marathon sitting. He was more critical of Funimation's packaging, preferring the first season's metal locker boxart to the packing for the half-season sets.|$|E
500|$|British {{critics were}} {{especially}} enthusiastic about Nicolas Roeg's direction. In {{the view of}} Tom Milne of Monthly Film Bulletin, Roeg's combined work on Performance, Walkabout and Don't Look Now put him [...] "right {{up at the top}} as film-maker". George Melly similarly wrote in The Observer that Roeg had joined [...] "that handful of names whose appearance {{at the end of the}} credit titles automatically creates a sense of anticipation". Penelope Houston <b>for</b> <b>Sight</b> & Sound also found much to appreciate in Roeg's direction: [...] "Roeg deploys subtle powers of direction and Hitchcockian misdirection." [...] American critics were similarly impressed with Roeg's work on the film. Jay Cocks regarded Don't Look Now to be Roeg's best work by far and that Roeg was one of [...] "those rare talents that can effect a new way of seeing". Cocks also felt that the film was a marked improvement on the novella, noting that a reading [...] "makes one appreciate Roeg and Screenwriters [...] Scott and [...] Bryant all the more. Film and story share certain basic elements of plot and an ending of cruel surprise. The story is detached, almost cursory. Roeg and his collaborators have constructed an intricate, intense speculation about levels of perception and reality." [...] Roger Ebert in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times commented that Roeg is [...] "a genius at filling his frame with threatening forms and compositions", while Pauline Kael labelled him [...] "chillingly chic" [...] in hers. Even Vincent Canby, whose opinion of the film was negative overall, praised Roeg for being able to [...] "maintain a sense of menace long after the screenplay has any right to expect it".|$|E

500|$|In The New Yorker, Penelope Gilliatt {{said it was}} [...] "some kind {{of great}} film, and an unforgettable endeavor... The film is hypnotically entertaining, and it is funny without once being gaggy, {{but it is also}} rather harrowing." [...] Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times opined that it was [...] "the picture that science fiction fans of every age and in every corner of the world have prayed (sometimes forlornly) that the {{industry}} might some day give them. It is an ultimate statement of the science fiction film, an awesome realization of the spatial future... it is a milestone, a landmark for a spacemark, in the art of film." [...] Louise Sweeney of The Christian Science Monitor felt that 2001 was [...] "a brilliant intergalactic satire on modern technology. It's also a dazzling 160-minute tour on the Kubrick filmship through the universe out there beyond our earth." [...] Philip French wrote that the film was [...] "perhaps the first multi-million-dollar supercolossal movie since D.W. Griffith's Intolerance fifty years ago which can be regarded as the work of one man...Space Odyssey is important as the high-water mark of science-fiction movie making, or at least of the genre's futuristic branch." [...] The Boston Globe's review indicated that it was [...] "the world's most extraordinary film. Nothing like it has ever been shown in Boston before or, for that matter, anywhere... The film is as exciting as the discovery of a new dimension in life." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film four stars in his original review, believing the film [...] "succeeds magnificently on a cosmic scale." [...] He later put it on his Top 10 list <b>for</b> <b>Sight</b> & Sound. Time provided at least seven different mini-reviews of the film in various issues in 1968, each one slightly more positive than the preceding one; in the final review dated December 27, 1968, the magazine called 2001 [...] "an epic film about the history and future of mankind, brilliantly directed by Stanley Kubrick. The special effects are mindblowing." ...|$|E
