2500|$|In a 1995 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Jagger said, [...] "I {{think that was}} taken from an old idea of Baudelaire's, I think, but I could be wrong. Sometimes when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> Baudelaire books, I can't see it in there. But it was an idea I got from French writing. And I just {{took a couple of}} lines and expanded on it. I wrote it as sort of like a Bob Dylan song." [...] It was Richards who suggested changing the tempo and using additional [...] percussion, turning the folk song into a samba.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2015, DeLillo {{received}} the 2015 Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters at the 66th National Book Awards Ceremony. The ceremony {{was held on}} November 8 in New York City, and he was presented his award by Pulitzer Prize winner Jennifer Egan, a writer profoundly influenced by DeLillo's work. In his acceptance speech, DeLillo reflected upon {{his career as a}} reader as well as a writer, recalling examining his personal book collection and feeling a profound sense of personal connection to literature: [...] "Here I’m not the writer at all, I’m a grateful reader. When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> book shelves I find myself gazing like a museum-goer." [...] In February 2016, DeLillo was the guest of honor at an academic conference dedicated to his work, [...] "Don DeLillo: Fiction Rescues History", a three-day event held at the Sorbonne Nouvelle in Paris, France.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> watch. It was six o'clock. I {{determined}} to lose no time.|$|R
60|$|He {{lapsed into}} silence. The train rolled on. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> watch. London {{was not far}} off now.|$|R
60|$|Ah! He, of course, would know. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> watch. It {{was twenty}} minutes past nine only.... Still.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nigher forty, it seems," [...] he muttered. [...] "Why, when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> father, sir, {{and come}} to think of it," [...] {{addressing}} Redlaw, with an impatience and irritation that were quite new, [...] "I'm whipped if I can see anything in him but a calendar of ever so many years of eating and drinking, and making himself comfortable, over and over again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the thing," [...] said Cecil. [...] "I mean it {{fast enough}} at home, {{and when my}} mother talks to me and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> brothers' graves, but it all gets swept away at Eton. It won't now, though, if you are different, Brownlow. I never liked any fellow like you I knew you were best, even when you were worst. So {{if you go in}} for doing right, I shan't care for anyone else—-not even Cressham and Bulford." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely yes! It was at your {{valuable}} {{suggestion that}} I thought of inviting my sister-in-law {{to visit me}} at St. Sallins. Ah, you remember it now. Forgive me if <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> watch; the dinner hour is on my mind. Not, as your dear little daughter there seems to think, because I am greedy, but because I am always punctual, in justice to the cook. Shall we see you to-morrow? Call early, {{and you will find}} us at home." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> watch. Yes, {{five hours}} had been {{gathered}} {{in by the}} grim scytheman. I went to dinner.|$|R
60|$|Perfectly {{clear it}} was, {{perfectly}} clear, and why hadn't I seen it before?... <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> watch, {{and it was}} half-past two.|$|R
60|$|I {{had many}} weary hours still to wait through. To while away the time, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> letters. Among {{them was a}} letter from Betteredge.|$|R
6000|$|She {{waved her}} hand impatiently. 'I must finish the play,' she answered. 'I only want a hint from you. You must know {{something}} about plays. Your brother has got a theatre. You must often have heard him talk about fourth and fifth acts--you must have seen rehearsals, {{and all the rest}} of it.' She abruptly thrust the manuscript into Henry's hand. 'I can't read it to you,' she said; 'I feel giddy when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> own writing. Just run your eye over it, there's a good fellow--and give me a hint.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Petru, my dear boy,' {{cried the}} emperor, both his eyes {{laughing}} together, 'I see {{you have got}} this on the brain. Well, I will let you into the secret. My right eye laughs when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> three sons, and see how strong and handsome you all are, and the other eye weeps because I fear that after I die {{you will not be}} able to keep the empire together, and to protect it from its enemies. But if you can bring me water from the spring of the Fairy of the Dawn, to bathe my eyes, then they will laugh for evermore; for I shall know that my sons are brave enough to overcome any foe.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, well a day--I suppose so, {{but then}} <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> good Master Brewster and {{remember}} how, when I was a girl, {{he was at}} our good Queen Elizabeth's court, ruffling it with the best, and everybody said that there wasn't a young man that had good fortune to equal his. Why, Master Davidson, the Queen's Secretary of State, thought all the world of him; and {{when he went to}} Holland on the Queen's business, he must take him along; and when he took the keys of the cities there, it was my master that he trusted them to, who used to sleep with them under his pillow. I remember when he came home to the Queen's court, wearing the great gold chain that the States had given him. Ah me! I little thought he would ever come to a poor man's coat, then!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> friend's notes, which, in fact, showed, {{that in one}} or two grossly obvious passages, I {{had left}} {{uncorrected}} such solecisms in grammar.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> watch. It wanted {{five minutes}} to twelve, when the premonitory {{symptoms}} of the working of the laudanum first showed themselves to me.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> watch. It {{was past}} three o'clock--quite the full swing of {{afternoon}} office {{work in the}} port. He snarled imperiously: [...] "Sit down, Captain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My father {{wished to}} speak to me about the money. He has plans for much of it, it appears, even now. Oh. John, he will never understand. I want so much to see you, to talk to you--there are times when I am {{actually}} afraid to be alone, and without you. If it be weakness to confess that I need your reassurance, your strength and comfort constantly, then I am weak. I once thought I could stand alone, that I had solved all problems for myself, but I know now how foolish I was. I have been face to face with such dreadful, unimagined things, and in my ignorance I did not conceive that life held such terrors. And when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> father, the thought of immortality turns me faint. After you have come here this afternoon there can be no longer any reason why we should not meet, and all the world know it. I will go with you to Mr. Bentley's.|$|E
6000|$|... "No--with my maid. She is {{a strange}} creature; if she feels sympathy, she never expresses it. 'I am your {{grateful}} servant, Miss. Where you go, I go.' That was all she said; I was not disappointed--I am getting used to Fanny Mere already. Mine is a lonely lot--isn't it? I have acquaintances among the few ladies who sometimes visit at my father's house, but no friends. My mother's family, as I have always been told, cast her off when she married a man in trade, with a doubtful reputation. I don't even know where my relations live. Isn't Lord Harry good enough for me, as I am now? When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> prospects, is it wonderful if I talk like a desperate woman? There is but one encouraging circumstance that I can see. This misplaced love of mine that everybody condemns has, oddly enough, a virtue that everybody must admire. It offers a refuge {{to a woman who}} is alone in the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hech! hech!" [...] he exclaimed, {{recovering}} all {{his native}} impudence, [...] "I hae {{had occasion to}} remark already, to anither leddy than yersel', that it's seemply mairvelous hoo a man's ain gude deeds find him oot in this lower warld o' ours. I hae dune a gude deed by pure Tammy Pennyquick, and here's a' Pairth ringing wi the report o' it; and Sawmuel Bishopriggs sae weel known that ony stranger has only to ask, and find him. Understand, I beseech ye, that it's no hand o' mine that pets this new feather in my cap. As a gude Calvinist, my saul's clear o' the smallest figment o' belief in Warks. When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> ain celeebrity I joost ask, as the Psawmist asked before me, 'Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?' It seems ye've {{something to say to}} me," [...] he added, suddenly reverting to the object of Anne's visit. [...] "Is it humanly possible that ye can ha' come a' the way to Pairth for naething but that?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> {{professional}} colleague {{with a new}} interest. He was {{the legitimate}} fountainhead {{of the information that}} I was dying to have poured into my mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "One—two—three"—had {{it really}} sounded three! Then it rang on a lower bell—"One—two—three." [...] A passing bell for a man! <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> mother—she {{turned away from}} me.|$|R
3000|$|... “If I was Syrian, I’d go to Britain, to Britain or Germany. But when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> options, Sweden was {{the easiest}} and most secure way.” (Ayham, Sweden).|$|R
60|$|But some care {{is needed}} in using Descartes' argument. 'I think, {{therefore}} I am' says rather more than is strictly certain. It might seem {{as though we were}} quite sure of being the same person to-day as we were yesterday, and this is no doubt true in some sense. But the real Self is as hard to arrive at as the real table, and {{does not seem to have}} that absolute, convincing certainty that belongs to particular experiences. When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> table and see a certain brown colour, what is quite certain at once is not 'I am seeing a brown colour', but rather, 'a brown colour is being seen'. This of course involves something (or somebody) which (or who) sees the brown colour; but it does not of itself involve that more or less permanent person whom we call 'I'. So far as immediate certainty goes, it might be that the something which sees the brown colour is quite momentary, and not the same as the something which has some different experience the next moment.|$|E
6000|$|You may {{say they}} won't grow, and say they'll decay-- Say it again till you're {{sick of the}} say, Get up on your ear, blow your blaring bazoo And hire a hall to {{proclaim}} it; and you May stand on a stump with a lifted hand As a pine may stand or a redwood stand, And stick to your story and cheek it through. But I point with pride to the far divide Where the Snake from its groves is seen to glide-- To Mariposa's arboreal suit, And the shaggy shoulders of Shasta Butte, And the feathered firs of Siskiyou; And I swear as I sit on my marvelous hair-- I roll my marvelous eyes and swear, And sneer, and ask where would your forests be To-day if it hadn't been for me! Then I rise tip-toe, with a brow of brass, Like a bully boy with an eye of glass; <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> gum sprouts, red and blue, And I say it loud and I say it low: [...] "They know their man and you bet they'll grow!" ...|$|E
6000|$|One {{night just}} as the {{equinoctial}} gales were coming when I was sailing home in the coastguard's boat a boy told me a beetle of solid gold, strayed maybe from Poe's [...] "gold bug," [...] had been seen by somebody in Scotland and I {{do not think that}} either of us doubted his news. Indeed, so many stories did I hear from sailors along the wharf, or round the fo'castle fire of the little steamer that ran between Sligo and Rosses, or from boys out fishing that the world was full of monsters and marvels. The foreign sailors wearing ear-rings did not tell me stories, but like the fishing boys, I gazed at them in wonder and admiration. When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> brother's picture, [...] "Memory Harbour," [...] houses and anchored ship and distant lighthouse all set close together as in some old map, I recognize in the blue-coated man with the mass of white shirt the pilot I went fishing with, and I am full of disquiet and of excitement, and I am melancholy because I have not made more and better verses. I have walked on Sinbad's yellow shore and never shall another hit my fancy.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> {{house with}} a quick flash of hope that faded immediately. The door had been forced; it was unfast and was opening slowly as I approached.|$|R
60|$|It was broad daylight. The {{sun shone}} brilliantly, {{the sky was}} cloudless. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> watch; it had stopped. Shortly {{afterwards}} I heard the hall clock strike six.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> {{interlocutor}} {{with rising}} curiosity. [...] "It certainly is {{rather like a}} diamond. But, if so, it is a Behemoth of diamonds. Where did you get it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|In my {{own case}} my inward {{watchman}} is, perhaps, somewhat out of practice. He does his best; {{but he is}} over-anxious; he worries himself, and loses count. I say to him, maybe, [...] "Five-thirty, please;" [...] and he wakes me with a start at half-past two. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> watch. He suggests that, perhaps, I forgot to wind it up. I put it to my ear; it is still going. He thinks, maybe, something has happened to it; he is confident himself it is half-past five, if not a little later. To satisfy him, I {{put on a pair}} of slippers and go downstairs to inspect the dining-room clock. What happens to a man when he wanders about the house in the middle of the night, clad in a dressing-gown and a pair of slippers, there is no need to recount; most men know by experience. Everything--especially everything with a sharp corner--takes a cowardly delight in hitting him. When you are wearing a pair of stout boots, things get out of your way; when you venture among furniture in woolwork slippers and no socks, it comes at you and kicks you. I return to bed bad tempered, and refusing to listen to his further absurd suggestion that all the clocks in the house have entered into a conspiracy against me, take half an hour to get to sleep again. From four to five he wakes me every ten minutes. I wish I had never said a word to him about the thing. At five o'clock he goes to sleep himself, worn out, and leaves it to the girl, who does it half an hour later than usual.|$|E
6000|$|... "There--I see that; don't put {{up another}} chip till <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> hand. A good man, says you? Pard, it ain't no name for it. He {{was the best}} man that ever--pard, you would have doted on that man. He could lam any galoot of his inches in America. It was him that put down the riot last {{election}} before it got a start; and everybody {{said he was the}} only man that could have done it. He waltzed in with a spanner {{in one hand and a}} trumpet in the other, and sent fourteen men home on a shutter in less than three minutes. He had that riot all broke up and prevented nice before anybody ever got a chance to strike a blow. He was always for peace, and he would have peace--he could not stand disturbances. Pard, he was a great loss to this town. It would please the boys if you could chip in something like that and do him justice. Here once when the Micks got to throwing stones through the Methodis' Sunday school windows, Buck Fanshaw, all of his own notion, shut up his saloon and took a couple of six-shooters and mounted guard over the Sunday school. Says he, 'No Irish need apply!' And they didn't. He was the bulliest man in the mountains, pard! He could run faster, jump higher, hit harder, and hold more tangle-foot whisky without spilling it than any man in seventeen counties. Put that in, pard--it'll please the boys more than anything you could say. And you can say, pard, that he never shook his mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{hurts me}} most," [...] he went on, [...] "is having {{to watch her}} making herself ridiculous. Yet what am I to do? If I explain things to her she will be miserable and ashamed of herself; added to which her frankness--perhaps her {{greatest}} charm--will be murdered. The trouble runs through everything. She won't take my advice about her frocks. She laughs, and repeats to me--well, the lies that other women tell a girl who is spoiling herself by dressing absurdly; especially when she is a pretty girl and they are anxious she should go on spoiling herself. She bought a hat last week, one day when I was not with her. It only wants the candles {{to look like a}} Christmas tree. They insist on her taking it off so they may examine it more closely, with the idea of having one built like it for themselves; and she sits by delighted, and explains to them the secret of the thing. We get to parties half an hour before the opening time; she is afraid of being a minute late. They have told her that the party can't begin without her--isn't worth calling a party till she's there. We are always the last to go. The other people don't matter, but if she goes they will feel the whole thing has been a failure. She is dead for want of sleep, and they {{are sick and tired of}} us; but if <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> watch they talk as if their hearts were breaking, and she thinks me a brute for wanting to leave friends so passionately attached to us.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> mistress. If she had {{directed}} me to knock Mr. James Smith down, big as he was, I {{think at that}} moment I could have done it.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> {{friend the}} brigadier for an explanation. After running his eye over the {{articles}} in the journals, the latter smiled, and cast a <b>look</b> of commiseration <b>at</b> our colleague.|$|R
6000|$|Everybody laughed now, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> hostess in {{a little}} bewilderment. She murmured, [...] "I suppose the joke is that he had befriended one man {{at the expense of}} six others." ...|$|R
