5|$|A silver boom {{occurred}} in England after {{the discovery of}} silver near Carlisle in 1133. Huge quantities of silver were produced from a semicircle of mines reaching across Cumberland, Durham and Northumberland – up to three to four tonnes of silver were mined each year, more than ten times the previous annual production across the whole of Europe. The result was a local economic boom and a major uplift to 12th-century royal finances. Tin mining was centred in Cornwall and Devon, exploiting alluvial deposits and governed by the special Stannary Courts and Parliaments. Tin formed a valuable <b>export</b> <b>good,</b> initially to Germany and then later in the 14th century to the Low Countries. Lead was usually mined as a by-product of mining for silver, with mines in Yorkshire, Durham and the north, {{as well as in}} Devon. Economically fragile, the lead mines usually survived as a result of being subsidised by silver production.|$|E
5|$|In {{standard}} {{models of}} international trade a fall {{in the price of}} a country's <b>export</b> <b>good</b> – a deterioration in its terms of trade – generally decreases the home country's welfare. In the Brander–Spencer model however the opposite is true. This is because in this model the markets are not perfectly competitive and the revenue from the expanded quantity sold compensates the firm for the revenue lost from the lower export price. If the good produced by the firm is also consumed domestically however the result is a bit more complicated. In the case where the firm is able to separate the home and export market (charge different prices in each with no possibility of third party arbitrage) then the level of the optimal subsidies will depend on whether marginal costs of production are constant, increasing or decreasing. The optimal subsidy level is either the same, higher or lower, respectively, compared to the level with no domestic consumption. This underscores the need {{on the part of the}} government for very precise information on industry structure and firm's cost functions.|$|E

2500|$|After Vasco da Gama's {{discovery}} of the sea route to India {{and the establishment of}} the Portuguese spice monopoly, Jakob Fugger took part in the spice trade and in 1503 opened a manufactory in Lisbon.

Along with other merchant houses of Germany and Italy he contributed to a fleet of 22 Portuguese ships led by Francisco de Almeida that sailed to India in the year 1505 and returned in 1506. Even though one third of the imported wares had to be ceded to the King of Portugal the operation still made significant profit. Soon afterwards the King declared the spice trade a monopoly of the crown in order to secure his income and exclude foreign merchants from participating.

50|$|If the RCA value exceeds one, {{the share}} of exports of a country in a given product is larger than {{the share of}} that product in all global trade.

30|$|How to {{calculate}} effectively the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> to set wage growth nationally in each year {{gives rise to}} some questions. In a country not experiencing technological change, productivity growth will be more static until reaching the technological frontier. Thus, reversion to its mean as a new wage policy is favorable. The future prediction of the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> is relatively difficult. As seen in the stock market, the change of any variables inclines toward its mean after straying above or below the mean {{in the long run}} in a free market economy. Figure  1 shows the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> and its mean by considering its historical fluctuation between 1973 and 2011. The historical mean of the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> is 3.7 %, calculated by taking into account approximately 38  years of the Turkish economy. Moreover, until the economy reaches the technological frontier, the configuration of the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> is unlikely to show any great long-term shift from its mean. In Fig.  1, although the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> strayed away from its historical average, in the long run, it moved closer to it and continued fluctuating around its mean. Therefore, it is desirable to consider the historical mean value of productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> for wage growth and estimate the flexibility of wage growth, where the two essentials should at least come to balance in the long run to reduce macroeconomic instability. To do this, wage growth, remaining above the mean, must increase at the same pace as the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> and reach its mean. Nevertheless, wage growth in the Turkish economy does not show a reversion to its mean and does not move around the mean. That shows that wage growth is not flexible and is generally influenced by economic policies in the country, running counter to the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods,</b> which has not been easy to control by government interventions or industrial actions. This new wage policy is important and must be considered by the trade unions, employers’ associations and the government.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{macroeconomic}} imbalances in the economy, Turkey needs to change its current institutional forms. First, Turkey must implement the mathematical base social contract. According {{to this type of}} contract, in {{order to reduce}} the individual interests of trade unions, employers’ associations and the government, wage growth must be indexed to the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods.</b> Second, Turkey needs to implement a new wage-setting policy, taking into consideration the reversion of the mean of the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods.</b> That means that wage policy in the country must be more flexible and be determined according to economic conditions. As the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> cannot be set by a control, but rather by market conditions, wage growth must be implemented by considering the reversion of the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> to its mean. Finally, a new inflation policy must be implemented for the sake of wage-bargaining policy. In other words, instead of considering the inflation rate for wage bargaining, the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> must be taken into account. Hence, Turkey will be able to reduce inflation and unit labor cost growth and experience more favorable macroeconomic factors.|$|R
