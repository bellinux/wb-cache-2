25|$|Frank Barnwell {{designed}} a clean single-bay biplane with staggered and unequal-span wings. Wire bracing was used {{only in the}} centre section; outboard of that was a single streamlined compression strut and a three-strut <b>drag</b> <b>brace</b> on each wing. Frise-type ailerons were fitted only to the upper wings. The fuselage was of fabric-covered metal construction, similar in detail {{to that of the}} Bulldog. Rudder and elevators were horn balanced and the tailplane was of cantilever, unbraced form. The undercarriage was divided and attached to the fuselage with streamlined legs and struts. The Jaguar installation left the cylinder heads exposed, but later engines were cowled with a Townend ring.|$|E
2500|$|The Renegades's wings have a {{positive}} stagger and incorporate a single faired interplane strut and cabane struts as well as wire-bracing. The top wing has a span of [...] and incorporates a 10 degree sweep to improve visibility from the pilot's back seat, accessibility for the front seat passenger and reduces adverse yaw. The lower wing has 3 degrees of dihedral. Ailerons are of the Friese type, with two ailerons on the lower wing standard and four ailerons optional. The front wing spar was initially a [...] aluminum tube and the rear spar is [...] "C" [...] channel. Starting 1 January 1989 the front spar was changed to a rectangular spar and an outboard <b>drag</b> <b>brace</b> was added, increasing wing rigidity. The ribs are stamped aluminum and mate with an aluminium sheet leading edge. All surfaces are covered with aircraft fabric. Controls are via torque tubes.|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} a simple method for calculating {{the position of}} the elastic axis of a wing structure having any number of spars. It is shown that strong <b>drag</b> <b>bracing</b> near {{the top and bottom of}} a wing greatly increases the torsional strength. An analytical procedure for finding the contribution of the <b>drag</b> <b>bracing</b> to the torsional strength and stiffness is described, based upon the principle of least work, and involving only one unknown quantity. A coefficient for comparing the torsional rigidity of different wings is derived in this report...|$|R
2500|$|The wing is a two-spar design, {{supported}} by a [...] "V" [...] strut and jury struts. The wing has internal lift and <b>drag</b> <b>bracing</b> wires. The ailerons were originally designed to be [...] "gapless", with the wing's Dacron covering extending over the ailerons. This is {{sometimes referred to as}} wing warping, but it differs from that employed on pioneer aircraft. In 1986 the company abandoned the [...] "gapless" [...] aileron design and moved to a more conventional separate aileron. Conversion kits for the existing aircraft fleet were made available. [...] The WT-11's wings are removable by two people in 15 minutes. The tail surfaces use a similar sealed-gap system, utilizing seamless transitions from the fixed fin and horizontal stabilizer to the movable rudder and elevator.|$|R

50|$|March 8, 2003 - a Fokker F27-500 Friendship {{with the}} {{registration}} N712FE, {{en route from}} Greensboro, North Carolina to New Bern, North Carolina, indicated an unsafe landing gear condition during the approach to New Bern. A tower flyby was performed, and the tower controller confirmed the right gear was not fully extended. The crew declared an emergency and diverted to Kinston Regional Jetport to conduct an emergency landing. On the landing roll the right main landing gear collapsed and the airplane slid off the runway. Examination of the right main landing gear revealed the <b>drag</b> <b>brace</b> was fractured. The aircraft was retired from service. There were no casualties.|$|E
40|$|After the {{successful}} application of composite materials on <b>drag</b> <b>braces</b> and trailing arms, Fokker Landing Gear B. V. (FLG) {{is interested in}} further developing their composite product family. Therefore it set out an assignment {{for the development of}} a conceptual design of a composite main fitting of a cantilever type nose landing gear. This assignment has been conducted at FLG from the 23 rd of March 2015 to the 22 nd of January 2016. The main fitting of the nose landing gear of the NH- 90 helicopter has been chosen as reference design. Through the use of analytical and numerical methods and tools, a conceptual design is developed which shows the technical feasibility of a composite main fitting. It was furthermore shown that a small size and highly specialized main fitting, as found on the NH- 90, does not result in a feasible business case. The weight savings are limited in comparison to its metal equivalent, and the manufacturing costs of the components are high. It is shown that the business case becomes more feasible for large main fittings, as found on medium to large commercial aircraft. Larger and thus heavier composite components are proven to be more cost-efficient. A case study has shown that the design is scalable with relative ease. It is thus recommended to investigate the potential of such large main fittings. This research has provided insight in future opportunities for the composite product family and has given FLG an outline of the conditions in which a composite main fitting could achieve a feasible business case.

50|$|By {{the end of}} World War I engine {{powers and}} airspeeds had risen enough that the <b>drag</b> caused by <b>bracing</b> wires on a typical biplane was {{significantly}} affecting performance, while the heavier but sleeker strut-braced parasol monoplane was becoming practicable. For a brief period this type of monoplane became the design of choice. Although it was soon outpaced by the true cantilever monoplane, it has remained in use ever since where ultimate performance is not an issue.|$|R
25|$|The wings were {{on top of}} {{the hull}} and were braced with four sets per side of Warren strut style interplane {{structures}} comprising 'V' struts, which obviated the need for <b>drag</b> inducing wire <b>bracing.</b> The wing structure was formed with built-up steel spars, four in the top wing and three in the lower wing, and duralumin ribs riveted to the spars and braced internally. The fuselage was also made up from formed steel members built up into a framework which was then covered with fabric or dural sheeting.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an aero-hydro-elastic {{model of a}} semi-submersible floating wind turbine. A specific attention is drawn to hydrodynamic modeling options and their effect onthe dynamic response of the platform. The NREL 5 MW reference wind turbine mounted on the historical concept of semi-submersible platform Dutch tri-floater is considered. Aspecific hydrodynamic model of loads on a semi-submersible platform is used within the wind turbine design code FAST from NREL. This hydrodynamic model includes nonlinearhydrostatic and Froude-Krylov forces, diffraction/radiation forces obtained from linear potential theory, and Morison forces {{to take into account}} viscous effects on the bracesand damping plates. The effect of the different hydrodynamic modeling options is investigated. As one could have expected, it is found that the effect of viscous <b>drag</b> on <b>braces,</b> and nonlinear Froude-Krylov loads, becomes larger with increasing wave height. Their effect remains of small order. Simulations also are run with directional waves, it is found that wave directionality induces larger transverse motions...|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} the other {{aircraft}} the 1910 Monoplane was a tractor monoplane with an uncovered wire-braced wood fuselage. It was powered by 40 hp (30 kW E.N.V. water-cooled engine. The fabric-covered wooden wings were mounted on the upper longerons of the fuselage, which tapered to a horizontal knife-edge at the tail, carrying a rectangular rudder and a fixed horizontal stabiliser with tip elevators at each end. In order to reduce <b>drag,</b> the wing <b>bracing</b> used flat steel ribbons rather than wires, the struts of the undercarriage were of streamline section, and a polished aluminium spinner was fitted to the wooden propellor. The twin radiators were positioned over the inner end of each wing, being curved to follow the wing section.The aircraft was exhibited at the 1910 Aero Exhibition at Olympia, after which it {{was taken to the}} Royal Aero Club's flying field at Eastchurch for testing, where it first flew on 3 April piloted by Warwick Wright.|$|R
50|$|Claudius Dornier {{gained the}} {{attention}} of Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin while working on a proposed trans-atlantic airship during 1913. Later he appointed him as chief designer of the Zeppelin-Werke at Lindau, responsible for building large patrol flying boats. Dornier's first design to be built was the Rs.I. This was a large aircraft (Riesenflugzeug in the German classification) constructed largely of high-strength steel for highly stressed parts, and Duralumin (aluminium alloy) for low stress parts.The wings were {{on top of the}} hull and were braced with four sets per side of Warren strut style interplane structures comprising 'V' struts, which obviated the need for <b>drag</b> inducing wire <b>bracing.</b> The wing structure was formed with built-up steel spars, four in the top wing and three in the lower wing, and duralumin ribs riveted to the spars and braced internally. The fuselage was also made up from formed steel members built up into a framework which was then covered with fabric or dural sheeting.The powerplant arrangements were unorthodox, with the two outboard engines housed inside the fuselage, each driving a pusher propeller via shafts and bevel gearboxes, and a central pusher engine in a nacelle between the wings.|$|R
