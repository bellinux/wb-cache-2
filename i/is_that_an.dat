5|$|In December 2010, Karelian Trains, a {{joint venture}} by VR and RZhD, started a new service linking Helsinki to St. Petersburg, Russia using {{a new model of}} the Pendolino called the Sm6 Allegro. The Sm6 is {{technically}} based on the Pendolino Nuovo, but its looks are similar to the Sm3. The most significant difference <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> Sm6 unit is composed of seven carriages. The train is capable of dual-voltage running due to differences between the electric systems of the Finnish and Russian rail network and is equipped with four pantographs.|$|E
5|$|Instead, the {{argument}} considers the entire collection (jumla) of contingent things, {{the sum total}} of every contingent thing that exists, has existed, or will exist. Avicenna argues that this aggregate, too, must obey the rule that applies to a single contingent thing; in other words, it must have something outside itself that causes it to exist. This cause has to be either contingent or necessary. It cannot be contingent, though, because if it were, it would already be included within the aggregate. Thus the only remaining possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> external cause is necessary, and that cause must be a necessary existent.|$|E
5|$|The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has had {{occurrences of}} {{actors and actresses}} {{nominated}} for two different Academy Awards in acting categories in a single year, with the first instance in 1938. Provided that they receive enough votes from the Academy in both categories to earn a nomination, there are no restrictions on actors being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor or actresses being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress in any given year. The sole rule with regard to multiple nominations <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> actor or actress cannot receive multiple nominations for the same performance. This rule was introduced in 1944 after Barry Fitzgerald received a Best Actor nomination and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance in Going My Way.|$|E

40|$|Abstract I aim to {{show that}} {{standard}} theories of counterfactuals are mistaken, not in detail, but in principle, and I aim to say what form a tenable theory must take. Standard theories entail a categorical interpretation of counterfactuals, on which to state <b>that,</b> if it <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>A,</b> it would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> C <b>is</b> to state something, not relative to any supposition or hypothesis, but categorically. On the rival suppositional interpretation, to state <b>that,</b> if it <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>A,</b> it would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> C <b>is</b> to state <b>that</b> it would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> C relative to the supposition <b>that</b> it <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>A.</b> The two interpretations make incompatible predictions concerning the correct evaluation of counterfactuals. I argue that the suppositional interpretation makes the correct prediction...|$|R

5|$|The {{discovery}} that birds are {{a type of}} dinosaur showed that dinosaurs in general are not, in fact, extinct as is commonly stated. However, all non-avian dinosaurs {{as well as many}} groups of birds did suddenly become extinct approximately 66million years ago. It has been suggested that because small mammals, squamata and birds occupied the ecological niches suited for small body size, non-avian dinosaurs never evolved a diverse fauna of small-bodied species, which led to their downfall when large-bodied terrestrial tetrapods were hit by the mass extinction event. Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time, including ammonites (nautilus-like mollusks), mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and many groups of mammals. Significantly, the insects suffered no discernible population loss, which left them available as food for other survivors. This mass extinction is known as the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the 1970s; at present, several related theories are supported by paleontologists. Though the consensus <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> impact event was the primary cause of dinosaur extinction, some scientists cite other possible causes, or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} of Voviyo (wedding songs), sung by women during a Ros, {{is important to}} this community. The procedure <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> elderly lady, usually the yejman (wife of the master of ceremonies, who is known as yejmani) who knows the voviyos, leads the song {{while the rest of}} the women sing along. Only women whose husbands are still living may sing. In ancient times, the wedding songs expressed very lofty sentiments and gave vent to the feelings of the people about the marriage partners and their families, invoking the blessing of God on them.|$|E

2500|$|Third, in {{the realm}} of applications, Boole's system could handle multi-term propositions and {{arguments}} whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments.

25|$|Scholars {{disagree}} about the precise {{formulation of the}} first proposition. One interpretation asserts that the missing proposition <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> act has moral worth only when its agent is motivated by respect for the law, {{as in the case}} of the man who preserves his life only from duty. Another interpretation asserts that the proposition <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> act has moral worth only if the principle acted upon generates moral action non-contingently. If the shopkeeper in the above example had made his choice contingent upon what would serve the interests of his business, then his act has no moral worth.|$|E
25|$|Capital {{acquisitions}} tax {{is charged}} to {{the recipient of}} gifts or inheritances, {{at the rate of}} 33% above a tax-free threshold.

25|$|The general goal of {{the test}} is to provide data about {{cognition}} and personality variables such as motivations, response tendencies, cognitive operations, affectivity, and personal/interpersonal perceptions.

25|$|In sum, the {{argument}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> {{understanding of the}} mental disorders must not only have a specific knowledge of brain constituents and genetics (inside-the-skin) but also the context (outside-the-skin) in which these parts operate (Koch and Laurent, 1999).

25|$|Modern {{portfolio}} theory (MPT), or mean-variance analysis, is {{a mathematical}} framework for assembling {{a portfolio of}} assets such that the expected return is maximized for a given level of risk, defined as variance.

25|$|It {{is argued}} that the {{rationale}} behind this law <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> iambic word {{at the beginning of}} the third metron might give the false impression that the line had come to an end.

25|$|The {{amount of}} current an {{alkaline}} battery can deliver is roughly proportional to its physical size.

A rule of thumb <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> AA alkaline battery can deliver 700 mA without any significant heating. Larger cells, such as C and D cells, can deliver more current. Applications requiring currents of several amperes, such as powerful flashlights and portable stereos, will require D-sized cells to handle the increased load.|$|E
