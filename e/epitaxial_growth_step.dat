40|$|Abstract. SiC power MOSFETs are {{expected}} to be normally-off type fast switching devices. The on-resistance of SiC power MOSFETs is much higher than the value predicted from the physical properties of SiC.

However, there is the SiO 2 /SiC interface roughness problem in SiC MOSFETs. There are many steps at the SiO 2 /SiC interface because a high off-angle is necessary for SiC <b>epitaxial</b> <b>growth.</b> These <b>steps</b> might make SiO 2 /SiC interfaces rough, which leads to reduction of channel mobility.

Shorter, 300 -{micro}m-long, uncoated devices have < 6 mA threshold currents. This high-performance is a combined result of placement of the oxide layers so as to achieve the minimum optical mode volume and bi-parabolic grading of the Al{sub x}Ga{sub 1 {minus}x}As heteroepitaxy for minimum height/potential barriers, less than 15 meV, created by the wide-energy-gap layers required for selective wet oxidation.

Parasitic edge transistors of oxide trench isolated N-MOSFETs and Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) N-MOSFETs, fabricated using Selective Epitaxial Growth/Epitaxial Lateral Overgrowth (SEG/ELO) technology, are caused by the boron out-diffusion during high temperature process steps. Employing a simple ammonia nitridation of the field oxide before the <b>epitaxial</b> <b>growth</b> <b>step,</b> boron out-diffusion into the surrounding oxide was suppressed. The parasitic edge transistors in both oxide trench isolated SEG N-MOSFETs and ELO-SOI N-MOSFETs were eliminated. ^ A unique and simple method is demonstrated for characterizing the electrical impact of a single stacking fault on Fully Depleted Thin-Film SOI MOSFETs. SOI islands are created using the SEG/ELO technology. The stacking faults are observed using a optical Nomarski microscope.

40|$|Needle fibre calcite {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{ubiquitous}} habits of calcite in vadose environments (caves deposits, soil pores, etc.). Its origin, either through inorganic, indirect or direct biological processes, has long been debated. In this study, investigations at 11 sites in Europe, Africa and Central America support arguments for its biogenic origin. The wide range of needle morphologies is the result of a gradual evolution of the simplest type, a rod. This rod is the elementary brick which, by aggregation and welding, builds more complex needles. The absence of cross-welded needles implies that they are welded in a mould, or under a longitudinal and unidirectional constraint, before being released inside the soil pores. The difference between the lengthening of the needles and the c axis can be explained by the existence of needles observed under a scanning electron microscope in organic sleeves, which can act as a mould during rod growth. Complex morphologies with epitaxial outgrowths on straight rods cannot have grown entirely inside organic microtubes; they must result from soil diagenesis after the release of straight rods in a soil-free medium. Whisker crystals are interpreted as the result of growth and coalescence of euhedral crystals on a rod. Rhomb chains are considered to be the consequence of successive <b>epitaxial</b> <b>growth</b> <b>steps</b> on a needle during variations in growth conditions. Isotopic signatures for needle fibre calcite vary from - 16. 63 [per mille] to + 1. 10 [per mille] and from - 8. 63 [per mille] to - 2. 25 [per mille] for Delta 13 C and Delta 18 O, respectively. The absence of high Delta 18 O values for needle fibre calcite precludes a purely physicochemical origin (evaporative) for this particular habit of calcite. As <b>epitaxial</b> <b>growth</b> cannot precipitate in the same conditions as initial needles, needle fibre calcite stable isotopic signatures should be used with caution as a proxy for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. In addition, it is suggested that the term needle fibre calcite should be kept for the original biogenic form. The other habit should be referred to as epitaxial forms of needle fibre calcite...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Production of a III-N substrate containing element(s) of group III involves: depositing III-N layer having thickness of ({{greater than or equal}} to 40, preferably greater than 100) microns, onto thin III-N layer of template on foreign substrate having slight intentional misorientation (0. 1 - 2, preferably 0. 1 - less than 1, especially 0. 3 - 0. 6) degrees, with respect to next crystallographic lattice plane of its surface onto which the III-N layer is deposited; or depositing layer by <b>epitaxial</b> <b>growth</b> under predetermined N/III ratio and reactor pressure, such that towards end of growth the N/III ratio and/or pressure in reactor is lowered, relative to predetermined ratio and/or pressure. The reduction of the N/III ratio, and/or reactor pressure is performed to (50 - 5) % of the predetermined N/III ratio, and/or to (65 - 25) % of the predetermined pressure, respectively; in the final stage (preferably in last 60 minutes, especially in last 30 minutes) of the <b>epitaxial</b> <b>growth</b> process.

Such unexpected <b>epitaxial</b> <b>growth</b> is discussed {{in the context of}} deposition processes of silicon thin films, based on silicon radicals and nanocrystals. Our results are supported by previous studies on plasma synthesis of silicon nanocrystals and point toward silicon nanocrystals being the most plausible building blocks for such <b>epitaxial</b> <b>growth.</b> The results lay the basis of a new approach for the obtaining of crystalline silicon thin films and open the path for transferring those epitaxial layers from c-Si wafers to low cost foreign substrates...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the low-temperature <b>epitaxial</b> <b>growth</b> of thin silicon films by hotwire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD). Using reflection {{high energy electron diffraction}} (RHEED) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we have found conditions for <b>epitaxial</b> <b>growth</b> at low temperatures achieving twinned <b>epitaxial</b> <b>growth</b> up to 6. 8 µm on Si(100) substrates at a substrate temperature of 230 °C. This opens the possibility of growing high quality films on low cost substrates. The H 2 :SiH 4 dilution ratio was set to 50 : 1 for all growths. Consistent with previous results, the epitaxial thickness is found to decrease with an increase in the substrate temperature...|$|R
