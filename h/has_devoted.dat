25|$|In this will, Hughes {{left his}} entire estate to the Hughes Medical Institute, {{as he had}} no {{connection}} to family and was seriously ill.

It was apparently in a home surrounding the Desert Inn Golf Course belonging to the mother of an assistant.

Morse is still the attorney of record for Hughes. Gay <b>has</b> <b>devoted</b> his life to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.|$|E
25|$|The {{story is}} told by two {{alternating}} first person narrators.

The other narrator is the perpetrator, whose identity is only revealed in the final part of the book, and whose plotting the reader is able to follow first hand. Time and again, flashbacks detail the second narrator's childhood, adolescence and young adulthood, thus giving a fully rounded picture of a deranged mind and explaining why someone should want to demolish a school's reputation and do harm to members of the staff.|$|E

25|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is the U.S. Federal agency {{responsible}} for conducting research and making recommendations for prevention {{of all kinds of}} occupational injuries and illnesses. Over the past 10 to 15 years, NIOSH <b>has</b> <b>devoted</b> considerable effort to building its capacity for research and prevention activities related to occupational road safety. This has been accomplished through analysis and interpretation of injury and fatality data development of injury prevention resources, and research to advance prevention of MVCs and resulting injuries in high-risk populations. NIOSH seeks to effect change through a variety of mechanisms: communication of research results through the peer-reviewed literature and industry channels, safety information targeted to employers and workers, changes in government regulations, and development of voluntary consensus standards.|$|E

25|$|Sicking <b>has</b> <b>devoted</b> {{his career}} to {{designing}} impact energy management systems, specifically focusing on crashworthy safety systems. Sicking has developed numerous “next generation” designs that have significantly reduced the risk of injury and fatality to motorists, from highway drivers to NASCAR racers. His first global success was the ET-2000, the first energy absorbing guardrail terminal – a device that sits over {{the end of a}} guardrail, flattening the guardrail when it is hit by a vehicle. The first study of the device showed that out of 400 crashes, there were three injuries and no fatalities—reducing the risk by a factor of 10. But even with detailed research data and real-world results showing the product a success, Sicking says he gets the most satisfaction from a personal testimonial.|$|E
