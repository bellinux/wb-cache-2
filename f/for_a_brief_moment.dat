5|$|During an interview, Satoh said Rurouni Kenshin {{was one of}} {{the first}} manga he read to the point he would play sword-fights with his friends. Additionally, once he was cast as Kenshin, Satoh started intense swordsmanship training. Satoh said he liked Kenshin's {{character}} to the point of enjoying role in the three films. However, the actor expressed pressure in doing the role as a result of having to take part in multiple fighting scenes. Nevertheless, Satoh said he enjoyed Kenshin's lines due to the impact they have on most characters, most notably his enemies. Due to the Kyoto films showing a darker characterization of Kenshin as he struggles against different strong rivals, Satoh also said his work became more challenging. Still, he found it interesting. A scene that Satoh enjoyed was Kenshin's fight against Sawagejō Chō due to the fact Kenshin is forced to attack his enemy even though he does not know his weapon is deadly which goes against his morals; as a result, Satoh briefly showed Kenshin's hitokiri side <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>moment.</b> The actor said he discussed this scene with the director who pleased with the result. Kenshin's strongest technique, the Amakakeru Ryū no Hirameki, was Satoh's favorite move as he likes its meaning. While Kenshin shouts his attacks' names in both manga and anime, Satoh instead decided to say the names after performing those moves.|$|E

25|$|Australia made steady inroads on day four, {{although}} at tea England had steadied somewhat at 4/142.

25|$|The {{start of}} the race saw Michael Schumacher {{immediately}} cut Montoya, making the Colombian brake and avoid a collision, this allowed Barrichello to get alongside Montoya coming into the first corner. Montoya however managed to out-brake the Brazilian into the first corner and thus was alongside Schumacher going through the corner. As the Williams and Ferrari travelled through the corner, Schumacher's Ferrari started to experience understeer and went into Montoya's car, taking the Ferrari front wing off. The incident left Montoya going wide and going off the track <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{are not in}} {{agreement}} about how much energy is contained in the vacuum. Quantum mechanics requires the energy to be large as Paul Dirac claimed it is, like a sea of energy. Other scientists specializing in General Relativity require the energy to be small enough for curvature of space to agree with observed astronomy. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle allows the energy to be as large as needed to promote quantum actions <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>moment</b> of time, even if the average energy is small enough to satisfy relativity and flat space.

25|$|Hungarian Pál Csernai, who {{had been}} {{assistant}} to Cramer's replacement, Gyula Lorant, became head coach. In his tenure, he revolutionised the style of Bayern by introducing the spatial defence, then in Munich referred to as Pal System. When Paul Breitner returned via Braunschweig from his years with Real Madrid, he formed a partnership with Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. The FC Breitnigge, reinforced with Belgian goalkeeping legend Jean-Marie Pfaff, Klaus Augenthaler and striker Dieter Hoeneß (brother of Uli), brought success back to Munich. Two championships and a cup resulted from this era.

25|$|In 733, fourteen-year-old Yang Yuhuan married Li Mao, the Prince of Shou {{and the son}} of Emperor Xuanzong and Consort Wu. She thus {{carried the}} title of Princess of Shou. After Consort Wu died in 737, Emperor Xuanzong was greatly saddened by the death of his then-favorite concubine. Some time after that, however, Princess Yang somehow came into Xuanzong's favor and the Emperor decided to take her as his consort. However, since Princess Yang was already the wife of his son, Emperor Xuanzong stealthily {{arranged}} her to become a Taoist nun, with the tonsured name Taizhen, in order to prevent criticism that would affect his plan of making her his concubine. Yang then stayed, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>moment,</b> as a Taoist nun in the palace itself, before Emperor Xuanzong made her an imperial consort after bestowing a new wife on his son Li Mao.

25|$|Floor spikes - The First Wars to The Third Wars and Series 8 onwards - These were {{pneumatic}} spikes {{located in}} several {{positions on the}} arena floor that came up whenever a robot drove over them. They trapped robots and on occasion flipped them. They were removed for Series 4 after causing many upsets during The Third Wars, where robots currently winning battles would be overturned and then lose. This most notably happened during Heat B when Behemoth was flipped, couldn't self-right and its opponent Pitbull won by default. For Series 8, a group of five large spikes forms {{one of the four}} main hazards of the arena. They are powerful and large enough to lift and trap robots <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>moment</b> (as happened to Bonk in the opening episode), but are not as fast as their predecessors. In theory, this will avoid the sort of upsets seen in Series 3. One spike 'hole' is capable of emitting sparks.|$|E

500|$|Initially {{intended}} to be a made-for-TV film, the film's producer Kenith Trodd upgraded his original plan to a cinema feature. The original working title for the film was [...] "Falling Man". Playwright Simon Gray was commissioned to write the screenplay, and Pat O'Connor chosen to direct. In contrast to the book, which is narrated as a recollection by Birkin as an old man, the film is set entirely in the 1920s, except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>moment</b> towards the end. In initial drafts of the screenplay, Gray had included a narrator, but O'Connor felt this was not the correct way to present the story:I felt that if I couldn’t do it in the present, suggesting internal pain by performance, then I wouldn’t really want to do it at all.|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} in Toronto, many black community {{leaders and their}} supporters expressed opposition to the show, protesting {{in front of the}} theatre, [...] "shouting insults and waving placards reading SHOW BOAT SPREADS LIES AND HATE and SHOW BOAT = CULTURAL GENOCIDE". Various theatre critics in New York, however, commented that Prince highlighted racial inequality in his production as to show its injustice, as well as to show the historical suffering of blacks. A critic noted that he included [...] "an absolutely beautiful piece of music cut from the original production and from the movie ... a haunting gospel melody sung by the black chorus. The addition of this number is so successful because it salutes the dignity and the pure talent of the black workers and allows them to shine <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>moment</b> on the center stage of the showboat".|$|E

500|$|Gotcha is a two-player maze game {{in which}} one player {{attempts}} to catch the other. The maze is composed of a repeating pattern of elements set in multiple columns on the screen. The [...] "Pursuer" [...] is represented by a square, while the [...] "Pursued" [...] is identified by a plus sign. As the Pursuer gets closer to the Pursued, an electronic beeping sound plays at an increasing rate until the Pursuer reaches the Pursued. Whenever the Pursued is caught, the Pursuer scores a point, the maze disappears <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>moment,</b> and the Pursuer is moved to a random position {{on the right side}} of the screen. There is no score for the Pursued, so determining who won is left to the players. The maze itself is continually changing, with two invisible lines half a screen apart scanning down the maze and overwriting maze elements. Above the maze is the Pursuer's score and the time elapsed in the game. Each game is for a set period of time. When time runs out, the game enters attract mode, where the score resets and the square and plus sign begin bouncing around the maze in a diagonal pattern as the maze continues to change. Each game costs a quarter. The time per round is adjustable per machine over a range from 30 seconds to 2 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Subotai and Valeria {{agree to}} help Conan {{complete}} Osric's quest and infiltrate the Temple of Set.

[...] Valeria is mortally wounded by Doom after he shoots a stiffened snake at her. [...] She dies in Conan's arms, acknowledging {{the price of the}} [...] "toll" [...] forewarned by the wizard in exchange for Conan's life, and is cremated at the Mounds, where Conan prepares with Subotai and the wizard to battle Doom. Conan asks Crom, the god of his people, to grant him revenge. By using booby traps and exploiting the terrain, they manage to slay Doom's warriors when they arrive. Just when Rexor is about to overcome Conan, Valeria reappears <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>moment</b> as a Valkyrie to save him from the mortal blow. After losing his men, Doom shoots a stiffened snake at the princess, but Subotai blocks the shot with his shield and the villain flees to his temple. [...] The battle ends with Conan having recovered his father's sword from his enemies, a sword splintered by his own, presumably thus symbolizing his triumph over the Riddle of Steel that his father had enjoined upon him in childhood as his life's work.|$|E
500|$|The car chase {{scene with}} Snake is a {{reference}} to the car chase scene in the 1968 film Bullitt. Music similar to the soundtrack of the television series The Streets of San Francisco is heard in the scene. Alf Clausen, a composer on The Simpsons who had previously worked on several police shows, wrote the music for the scene. In another reference to The Streets of San Francisco and other Quinn Martin productions, a voice-over and caption proclaims the name of act two of the episode, [...] "Act II - Death Drives a Stick", after the episode's first act break {{in the middle of the}} Snake car chase. In the sequence where Bart imagines himself testifying in court, his face is obscured with a blue dot; this is a references to the television coverage of the rape trial of William Kennedy Smith, in which the woman who accused Smith of raping her was obscured with a blue dot over her face. The way the scene changes from Bart and Skinner talking in Skinner's office to them searching through the lockers is {{a reference to}} the same style of scene change used in the 1960s Batman television series, in which a close-up of Batman's face with dramatic music in the background is shown <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>moment</b> before the scene changes. The song heard when Bart and Skinner search through the lockers for the Teachers' Editions is a variation of Harold Faltermeyer’s [...] "Axel F" [...] from the film Beverly Hills Cop.|$|E

British legal theorists have generally regarded their American counterparts with something between indifference and amused complacency. Our most distinctive legal-intellectual achievement, legal realism, is classified in British jurisprudence texts as an odd minor school of chaps who rather curiously supposed law was just what judges do, and do according to passing psychological whims, political fancies, or hunches...|$|R
