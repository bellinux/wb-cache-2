40|$|Objective: {{to verify}} the {{effectiveness}} of the pelvic floor muscles rehabilitation program (PFMRP) in female volleyball athletes, analyzing the amount and frequency of urinary leakage. Methods: experimental study. The sample consisted of 32 female athletes from Famalic&# 227;o Athletic Volleyball Club (Portugal). The athletes were selected by convenience and distributed randomly into two groups: experimental group (EG = 16 athletes) and the control group (CG = 16 athletes). The EG underwent PFMRP for three months. The PFMRP was the awareness and identification of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM), pre-timed PFM contraction prior to occasions of increased intra-abdominal pressure, and 30 daily contractions of MPP at home. The CG had only access to the pamphlet. The assessment instruments included the questionnaires, the Pad Test (amount of urinary leakage) and <b>frequency</b> <b>record</b> of urinary leakage (7 -day diary) before and after PFMRP. Results: the amount of urine leakage decreased in 45. 5 % of athletes under PFMRP intervention, and in 4. 9 % of athletes in CG, with statistical differences between the groups (p < 0. 001). The reduction in the frequency of urinary leakage was 14. 3 % in EG, and 0. 05 % in CG, a statistically significant difference between the groups (p < 0. 001).

The incidence of malnutrition rises sharply {{between the ages of}} 6 - 18 months (WHO, 2001) with maximum undernutrition occurring at 8 - 11 months of age (Vir, 2001). The NFHS- 2 (1998 - 99) also reports a 5 fold increase in undernutrition prevalence from 6 months to 23 months of age. A formative study was undertaken in 6 villages of District Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh with the objective to understand the current complementary feeding practices and assess the malnutrition status in rural Uttar Pradesh with specific focus on identifying the barriers and promoters to the appropriate CF practices.

40|$|Heterojunction planar Gunn {{devices were}} first {{demonstrated}} by Khalid et al in 2007. This new design of Gunn device, or transferred electron device, {{was based on}} the well-established material system of GaAs as the oscillation media. The design did not only breakthrough the <b>frequency</b> <b>record</b> of GaAs for conventional Gunn devices, but also has several advantages over conventional Gunn devices, such as the possibility of making multiple oscillators on a single chip and compatibility with monolithic integrated circuits. However, these devices faced the challenge of producing high enough RF power for practical applications and circuit technology for integration. This thesis describes systematic work on the design and characterisations of planar Gunn diodes and the associated millimetre-wave circuits for RF signal power enhancement. Focus has been put on improving the design of planar Gunn diodes and developing high performance integrated millimetre-wave circuits for combining multiple Gunn diodes. Improvement of device design has been proved {{to be one of the}} key methods to increase the signal power. By introducing additional δ-doping layers, electron concentration in the channel increases and better Gunn domain formation is achieved, therefore higher RF power and frequency are produced. Combining multiple channels in the vertical direction within devices is another effective way to increase the output signal power as well as DC-to-RF conversion efficiency. In addition, an alternative material system, i. e. In 0. 23 Ga 0. 77 As, has also been studied for this purpose. Planar passive components, such as resonators, couplers, low pass filters (LPFs), and power combiners with high performance over 100 GHz have been developed. These components can be smoothly integrated with planar Gunn diodes for compact planar Gunn oscillators, and therefore contribute to RF power enhancement. In addition, several new measurement techniques for characterising oscillators and passive devices have also been developed during this work and will be included in this thesis.

40|$|HCFC- 22 (CHClF 2, chlorodifluoromethane) is an ozone-depleting {{substance}} (ODS) {{as well as}} a significant greenhouse gas (GHG). HCFC- 22 has been used widely as a refrigerant fluid in cooling and air-conditioning equipment since the 1960 s, and it has also served as a traditional substitute for some chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) controlled under the Montreal Protocol. A low <b>frequency</b> <b>record</b> on tropospheric HCFC- 22 since the late 1970 s is available from measurements of the Southern Hemisphere Cape Grim Air Archive (CGAA) and a few Northern Hemisphere air samples (mostly from Trinidad Head) using the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) instrumentation and calibrations. Since the 1990 s high-frequency, high-precision, in situ HCFC- 22 measurements have been collected at these AGAGE stations. Since 1992, the Global Monitoring Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA/ESRL) has also collected flasks on a weekly basis from remote sites across the globe and analyzed them for a suite of halocarbons including HCFC- 22. Additionally, since 2006 flasks have been collected approximately daily at a number of tower sites across the US and analyzed for halocarbons and other gases at NOAA. All results show an increase in the atmospheric mole fractions of HCFC- 22, and recent data show a growth rate of approximately 4 % per year, resulting in an increase in the background atmospheric mole fraction by a factor of 1. 7 from 1995 to 2009. Using data on HCFC- 22 consumption submitted to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), as well as existing bottom-up emission estimates, we first create globally-gridded a priori HCFC- 22 emissions over the 15 yr since 1995.

Each study participant completed a 24 -hour dietary recall record plus food <b>frequency</b> <b>record,</b> medical history, validated nutrition knowledge test, and finger stick blood sample prior to program enrollment or nutrition education, and again six months later. There were 42 WIC, 26 EFNEP, 23 WIC-control, and 23 EFNEP-control participants. Paired t-tests were used to find differences between preprogram and postprogram evaluation scores for the variables of nutrition knowledge score, hematocrit level, ferritin level, and levels of several nutrients. Nutrition knowledge test scores increased significantly from preprogram to postprogram for both WIC and EFNEP participants (14. 2 ± 3. 27 to 15. 5 ± 2. 89 for WIC, 14. 2 ± 3. 77 to 15. 6 ± 2. 79 for EFNEP).

40|$|Present day {{global warming}} is {{primarily}} caused by the greenhouse effect of the increased CO 2 emissions since {{the onset of the}} industrial revolution. A coupling between temperature and the greenhouse gas CO 2 has also been observed in several ice-core records on a glacial-interglacial timescale as well as on a millennial timescale during the glacials. In marked contrast, no significant ice-derived CO 2 fluctuations occur on centennial time scales contemporaneously with well-documented cooling events such as the Younger Dryas, Preboreal Oscillation, and the 8. 2 kyr BP event. Intriguingly however, the Little Ice Age cooling event seems to be recorded in several Antarctic ice cores of the last millennium, showing changes in CO 2 from 5 - 12 ppmv As CO 2 fluctuations of these magnitudes only generate a minor temperature response the role of these small CO 2 perturbations in climate forcing of the last millennium is considered to be non-significant. An alternative methodology to assess palaeo-atmospherical CO 2 concentrations, is based on the inverse relationship between the number of leaf stomata and the atmospheric CO 2 concentration. Compared to the ice cores this stomatal frequency based CO 2 proxy in general observes a much more dynamic CO 2 regime throughout the Holocene and therefore implies a much larger role for CO 2 in Holocene climate forcing. In order to corroborate the concept of coupling between atmospheric CO 2 and temperature during the onset of the Little Ice Age, a palaeo-atmospheric CO 2 reconstruction {{for the first half of}} the past millennium was developed by studying a high resolution stomatal <b>frequency</b> <b>record</b> from fossil Quercus robur (oak) leaves from the Netherlands. The results of this study indicate that during the thirteenth century AD a 35 ppmv shift in atmospheric CO 2 did occur. More evidence of this CO 2 perturbation have previously been observed in one other stomatal frequency based record and two Antarctic ice core records. By applying a firn diffusion model on the in this study presented stomatal frequency based CO 2 reconstruction, the lower amplitude of the recorded shift in the ice core D 47 could be fully explained by smoothing of the ice core record due to the diffusion processes that take place in the firn layer of the ice. Radiative forcing calculations of the stomatal frequency based CO 2 record suggest a more prominent role for CO 2 in climate forcing during the onset of the Little Ice Age...|$|E

40|$|To {{clarify the}} nature of the link between CO 2 and climate on {{relatively}} short time-scales, precise, high-resolution reconstructions of the pre-industrial evolution of atmospheric CO 2 are required. Adjustment of stomatal frequency to changes in atmospheric CO 2 allows plants of many species to retain the most profitable balance between carbon uptake for photosynthesis and loss of water through evaporation. Thus, quantification of CO 2 responsiveness of individual tree species over the last century enables estimation of CO 2 levels by measuring stomatal frequency of fossil leaves. So far, stomata-based CO 2 reconstructions for the Holocene have mainly been derived from fossil leaves of broad-leaved trees and shrubs. This thesis aims to assess the potential of conifer needles for such reconstructions, because of the long-term dominance of conifers in temperate and boreal forest ecosystems. Four native North American conifer species (Tsuga heterophylla, Picea glauca, P. mariana, and Larix laricina) show a decrease in stomatal frequency to a range of historical CO 2 mixing ratios (290 to 370 ppmv). Because of the specific mode of leaf development and the subsequent stomatal patterning in conifer needles, the commonly used stomatal index is not affected by CO 2 in these species, in contrast to the number of stomata per mm needle length. The lack of change in either stomatal density or stomatal density per mm needle length {{in the final stages of}} leaf growth indicates that in conifers cell expansion during leaf maturation does not significantly affect stomatal density based CO 2 reconstructions. Paleo-atmospheric CO 2 concentrations over the period 800 - 2000 AD are reconstructed from fossil T. heterophylla needles preserved in sediments of the small lake Jay Bath (Mount Rainier, Washington, USA). The stomatal <b>frequency</b> <b>record</b> reveals significant century-scale fluctuations, with prominent minima in CO 2 of about 260 ppmv present around 860 AD and 1150 AD, and smaller minima of 275 - 280 ppmv occurring around 1600 and 1800 AD. In between, CO 2 maxima of 300 ppmv around 1000 AD, 320 ppmv around 1300 AD and 300 ppmv around 1700 AD are recorded. These features occur in harmony with global terrestrial temperature changes, as well as oceanic surface temperature fluctuations in the North Atlantic, reinforcing the notion of a continuous coupling of CO 2 and climate during Holocene times. Very low stomatal numbers in T. heterophylla before 750 AD can be associated with highly stressed growth conditions in an early-successional habitat rather than extremely high CO 2 levels. After 750 AD, the uninterrupted presence of a stable late-successional forest justifies interpretation of stomatal frequency data in terms of atmospheric CO 2 levels. Carbon-isotope data over the last two millennia shows that changes in stomatal numbers are not affected by volcanic CO 2 outgassing of Mount Rainier. The CO 2 reconstruction from Jay Bath over the last 1200 years is included in a comparison with other stomata-based CO 2 estimates that correspond to documented, centennial-scale Holocene cooling events. These reconstructions from contrasting plant taxa and geographical regions match very well and provide evidence for centennial scale CO 2 fluctuations linked to short-term climate changes throughout the past 12. 000 years...|$|E

Connectivity between sound frequency and fish respond indicates that source of sound frequency has been to function as an attractor. The objectives of this research were to determine the sound frequency of L. argentimaculatus and to describe fish respond of the sound <b>frequency</b> that <b>records</b> as an attractor for fish to find to signal in a laboratory scale. Source of sound frequency was L. argentimaculatus with total length 17 – 22 cm that doing some activities to find feed. Attractor that used in this research was a to research sound editting <b>frequency</b> <b>recording</b> of L. argentimaculatus that was feeding activity and sound of feed target. Lowest frequency range of L. argentimaculatus was 100, 8 Hz while highest frequency range was 3244, 1 Hz with the intensity range was 30 dB to 57 dB. The significant response time difference of L. argentimaculatus was between morning and daytime observation and between daytime and evening observation...|$|R

The afferent discharge facilitation proved to be inversely related to the fibre's initial resting activity. The K effect is systematically larger than the Rb effect. High sensitive and scarcely sensitive units may be identified with respect to K and Rb action. The present findings suggest that, according to previous models of hair celi functioning, the K and Rb effects are mediated by a raise in intracellular Ca concentration which sustains an increased transmitter release at the cyto-neural junction...|$|R
