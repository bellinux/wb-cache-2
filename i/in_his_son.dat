When Truman was a boy, his {{character}} {{on the show}} was killed off to instill a fear of water <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> that would prevent Truman from leaving the set; however, he sneaks back onto the set when Truman is an adult. This causes Truman to begin questioning his staged life, and {{as he tries to}} get away from it the writers are forced to write a plot in which Kirk had not drowned but had suffered from amnesia.|$|E
5|$|Anthony Dominick Benedetto {{was born}} on August 3, 1926, in Astoria, Queens, New York, to grocer John Benedetto and {{seamstress}} Anna Suraci. In 1906, John had emigrated from Podàrgoni, a rural eastern district of the southern Italian city of Reggio Calabria. Anna {{had been born in}} the U.S. shortly after her parents also emigrated from the Calabria region in 1899. Other relatives came over as well as part of the mass migration of Italians to America. Tony grew up with an older sister, Mary, and an older brother, John Jr. With a father who was ailing and unable to work, the children grew up in poverty. John Sr. instilled <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> a love of art and literature and a compassion for human suffering, but died when Tony was 10 years old. The experience of growing up in the Great Depression and a distaste for the effects of the Hoover Administration would make the child a lifelong Democrat.|$|E

5|$|The goddesses {{find and}} restore Osiris's body, {{often with the}} help of other deities, {{including}} Thoth, a deity credited with great magical and healing powers, and Anubis, the god of embalming and funerary rites. Osiris becomes the first mummy, and the gods' efforts to restore his body are the mythological basis for Egyptian embalming practices, which sought to prevent and reverse the decay that follows death. This part of the story is often extended with episodes in which Set or his followers try to damage the corpse, and Isis and her allies must protect it. Once Osiris is made whole, Isis conceives his son and rightful heir, Horus. One ambiguous spell in the Coffin Texts may indicate that Isis is impregnated by a flash of lightning, while in other sources, Isis, still in bird form, fans breath and life into Osiris's body with her wings and copulates with him. Osiris's revival is apparently not permanent, and after this point in the story he is only mentioned as the ruler of the Duat, the distant and mysterious realm of the dead. Although he lives on only in the Duat, he and the kingship he stands for will, in a sense, be reborn <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>son.</b>|$|E

Nanda agreed to Minye Kyawhtin's accession, granting him the title Minye Thihathu, King of Toungoo, the same style used by their grandfather Mingyi Swe. For his part, Minye Thihathu II pledged loyalty to his half-cousin, and brother-in-law.|$|E

25|$|Mordechai Eliyahu {{was born}} in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem, the son of Iraqi Jewish Rabbi Salman Eliyahu, a Jerusalem Kabbalist, and his wife Mazal. The surname was Hebraicised from Elias. He had an older brother, Naim Ben Eliyahu, a younger sister Rachel, and brother Shimon. Salman was a disciple of the Ben Ish Hai, who was Mazal's great-uncle. She was a sister of Yehuda Tzadka. The family was poor, so Mordechai improvised ways in which to study, which he often did by candlelight.

25|$|George MacDonald, under whom Blackford {{had studied}} law, left his law {{practice}} {{in the east and}} moved to the Indiana in 1818. Blackford began courting his daughter Caroline, who was fourteen years younger than himself. They were married on December 23, 1819, in Vincennes by Reverend Samuel T. Scott. Their brief marriage was strained because of the age difference. Caroline wished to entertain and enjoyed the high society that Blackford's position brought, while Blackford preferred to live reclusively. They had one son, George, born on May 3, 1821. Caroline died in childbirth, a shock from which Blackford never fully recovered and leading him to become very protective and invested <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>son.</b> Blackford wrote to his mother of his unhappiness in marriage, and, after his wife's death, he vowed to never marry again.|$|E
25|$|News {{spread quickly}} among the Italian courts, and Guy de Brimeu, {{counselor}} of the Duke of Burgundy, was particularly surprised about the developing {{news of the}} marriage. Ferdinand knew that the wedding plans were fluctuating and subject to political uncertainties and questions, and this was even more true elsewhere like in the Court of Burgundy. He confided <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> with two major tasks: the first was to give to Charles the Bold the collar of the Order of the Ermine he had created, and welcome him to the Order of the Knights of the Fleece or, the second was to replace, in the entourage of Charles, Nicola di Monforte Pietravalle, Count of Campobasso, a former vassal of Ferdinand who served René of Anjou and had ties to John of Calabria, who recruited mercenaries in Piedmont, Lombardy and Emilia {{to serve in the}} army of Burgundy.|$|E

25|$|On 5 October, not yet forty, Henry died at Bodfeld, the {{imperial}} hunting lodge in the Harz Mountains. His heart went to Goslar, {{his body to}} Speyer, to lie next to his father's in the family vault in the cathedral of Speyer. He {{had been one of}} the most powerful of the Holy Roman Emperors: his authority as king in Burgundy, Germany, and Italy was only rarely questioned, his power over the church was at the root of what the reformers he sponsored later fought against <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>son,</b> and his achievement in binding to the empire her tributaries was clear. Nevertheless, his reign is often pronounced a failure in that he apparently left problems far beyond the capacities of his successors to handle. The Investiture Controversy was largely the result of his church politics, though his popemaking gave the Roman diocese to the reform party. He united all the great duchies save Saxony to himself at one point or another but gave them all away. His most enduring and concrete monument may be the impressive palace (kaiserpfalz) at Goslar.|$|E
25|$|Several {{authors have}} left memoirs of Ion Luca Caragiale. They include Octavian Goga and Ioan Slavici, I. Suchianu, Luca Caragiale, Ecaterina Logadi-Caragiale, and Cincinat Pavelescu. Among his later biographers was Octav Minar, who stood {{accused of having}} forged certain details for {{commercial}} gain. Direct or covert depictions of Caragiale are also present in several fiction works, starting with a revue first shown during his lifetime, and including novels by Goga, Slavici, N. Petraşcu, Emanoil Bucuţa, Eugen Lovinescu, Constantin Stere, {{as well as a}} play by Camil Petrescu. In 1939, B. Jordan and Lucian Predescu, published a common signature novel on the writer, which was criticized for its style, tone, and inaccuracies. The short story writer Brătescu-Voineşti proposed that Ion Luca Caragiale's love affair with Veronica Micle and Eminescu's anger provide the key to Eminescu's poem Luceafărul, but his theory remains controversial. Caragiale is also probably present <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> Mateiu's work Craii de Curtea-Veche, where his lifestyle and contribution to literature appear to be the subjects of derision.|$|E

500|$|The {{relationship}} between Lionel {{and his son}} Lex is strained; it has been likened to the {{relationship between}} Norman and Harry Osborn in the Spider-Man movie. Glover tried to make Lionel appear as though he is trying to [...] "toughen [...] up". The character is made to [...] "go out of his way, to give [...] tests, so [...] can prove himself". Glover sees the character as a rich and powerful businessman who is disappointed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>son.</b> Glover's goal for season one was to show Lionel's attempts to make Lex tougher; he interprets the character's motto in his raising of Lex as [...] "no risk, no rewards".|$|E
500|$|John Glover plays Lionel Luthor, Lex's father. Lionel is {{responsible}} for the Kents' adoption of Clark without legal ramifications or questions about his origins. Glover tried to make Lionel seem to try to [...] "toughen [...] up", and saw the character as a rich, powerful businessman who was disappointed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>son.</b> Lionel was created for Smallville to parallel the Kents and as an [...] "experiment in extreme parenting." [...] A recurring first-season guest, Glover became a series regular from seasons two to seven until Lionel was murdered by Lex {{near the end of the}} seventh season. Lionel returns in a parallel-universe version, also portrayed by Glover, during the final season in a recurring role.|$|E
