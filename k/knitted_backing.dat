25|$|Since {{turbulence}} at {{a surface}} {{is the source}} of wind noise, reducing gross turbulence can add to noise reduction. Both aerodynamically smooth surfaces, and ones that prevent powerful vortices being generated, have been used successfully. Historically, artificial fur has proved very useful for this purpose since the fibres produce micro-turbulence and absorb energy silently. If not matted by wind and rain, the fur fibres are very transparent acoustically, but the woven or <b>knitted</b> <b>backing</b> can give significant attenuation. As a material it suffers from being difficult to manufacture with consistency, and to keep in pristine condition on location. Thus there is an interest (DPA 5100, Rycote Cyclone) to move away from its use.|$|E

2500|$|Machine {{knitting}} saves {{a considerable}} amount of time but does require learning to operate the machines correctly. [...] Most if not all hand knitting patterns can be worked up on a machine, either identically or in a similar design. Hand knitting patterns are designed to [...] "flip" [...] the fabric on every row so that the knitter consistently uses the dominant hand. However, machine knitting is consistently knit with the fabric facing the same way. Flat Bed machines <b>knit</b> <b>back</b> and forth and Circular machines knit continuously in the round.|$|R
50|$|Though <b>knitting</b> <b>back</b> {{and forth}} on rigid {{straight}} needles was the norm, she advocated knitting in the round using flexible circular needles to produce seamless garments {{and to make it}} easier to knit intricate patterns. She also advocated the Continental knitting method, claiming that it is the most efficient and quickest way to knit. During World War II, German or continental knitting fell out of favor in the UK and US due to its association with Germany. Many English-language books on knitting are in the English or American style. Elizabeth Zimmermann helped to re-introduce continental style knitting to the United States.|$|R

He was quickly replaced by Richard Butcher, before being transported to a local hospital for treatment. His arm was pinned back together and he was originally expected to be out for eight weeks, but his arm failed to <b>knit</b> <b>back</b> together correctly and, in November, this was eventually extended to an estimated three months out, from the injury {{and was forced to}} undergo a second operation where surgeons were forced to graft bone from his hip onto his arm. His arm was eventually secured using a metal plate and nine pins. He was forced to retire from football at the age of 32 on medical advice after being warned of potential permanent disability if he injured the arm again.|$|R
5000|$|Each knitter {{has her own}} {{method of}} making a shawl collar, using garter stitch, basket stitch, or ribbing, and {{knitting}} in one colour or incorporating stripes. [...] A common technique is to pick up {{two of the four}} base stitches, start on one side and work up the neck edge to the shoulder by picking up a stitch from the lapel edge on each row and increasing the width of the collar as it is worked. The top ends in line with the shoulder seam. The same is done for the other side. The knitter then picks up stitches from the neck edge and <b>knits</b> <b>back</b> and forth, increasing on each row and picking up stitches form the top of the lapel, then casts off the collar back. Some skilled knitters are able to pick up stitches all around the neckline and knit the collar all at one time by increasing and decreasing for shaping.|$|R

5000|$|In {{circular}} knitting, the hand-knitter generally knits {{everything from}} one side, usually the right side. Circular knitting is usually {{carried out on}} a single circular needle.

5000|$|As an aside, <b>knitting</b> {{through the}} <b>back</b> loop {{is a useful}} {{technique}} for untwisting stitches on the left-hand needle that [...] "hang backwards".

2500|$|In using circulars to knit flat {{pieces of}} fabric the two ends are used just as two {{separate}} needles would be. [...] The knitter holds one tip {{in each hand}} and knits straight across {{the width of the}} fabric, turns the work, and <b>knits</b> or purls <b>back</b> the other way. [...] Using circular needles has some advantages, for example, the weight of the fabric is more evenly distributed, therefore less taxing, on the arms and wrists of the knitter and, the length of the cable may be longer than would be practical with rigid needles since the cable and fabric rest in the lap of the knitter rather than extending straight out past the arms.|$|R

Lua Hok-ke, a man about five years older than I, who had worked {{at a variety of}} jobs from coal mining to raising ducks to knitting sweaters at his wife’s natal family’s house, lectured me on the diligence of his people. Taiwanese people, I think everybody knows, are the most hard-working in the world.

5000|$|Plaited {{stitches}} can {{be produced}} in several ways. <b>Knitting</b> into the <b>back</b> loop produces a clockwise plaited stitch in the lower stitch being knitted (i.e., the loop {{that was on the}} left-hand needle.) The clockwise-plaited stitch is also called a left crossed stitch, since the left strand (i.e., the outgoing strand) of the loop crosses over the right incoming strand. Left-crossed stitches are sometimes called twisted stitches, although the latter term might be confused with similar terms from cable knitting. Conversely, a counterclockwise plaited stitch {{can be produced}} if the yarn is wrapped around the needle in the opposite direction as normal while knitting a stitch. Such a stitch is also called a [...] "right crossed stitch", since the right incoming strand crosses over the left outgoing strand. Here, the plait appears in the upper stitch being knitted, i.e., in the new loop being formed. In the [...] "brute-force" [...] approach, the knitter can produce any sort of plaiting by removing the stitch to be knitted from the left-hand needle, twisting it as desired, then returning it to the left-hand needle and knitting it.|$|R

5000|$|Frederick P. Salvucci, an engineer, {{said this}} of Sargent and the {{cancellation}} of the inner belt: Yes, of course. In many ways the most thrilling {{moment in the history}} of the antihighway fight was when we won. And then Governor Sargent went on television and said, basically, he had been the public works commissioner who had fought for the inner belt earlier in his career and, as governor he said it was a mistake and [...] "I'm going to admit that mistake and stop the program and we're going to shift towards public transportation." [...] I mean it was thrilling. It was thrilling for us that had worked hard on it, but also, in fairness to Sargent how often do you see a public official who gets up and says, [...] "I was wrong"? I mean it was an incredibly courageous thing for Frank Sargent to do, and I'm a Democrat. I don't say many good things about republicans. But he was a great man. I mean he had worked for this program. He always had an environmentalist bent to him. A lot of people do political analysis as to why he did this or that. I think he just believed what he said. [...] "This was a mistake and we're going to go in a different direction." [...] It was a thrilling moment in the history of it.And then we actually moved in that new direction. I mean we shifted the funds, partly under Governor Sargent, partly under Governor Dukakis. Those monies that were going to go into destroying those neighborhoods or building the highways were shifted into refurbishing the commuter rail system, extending the Red Line, relocating the Orange Line, basically rebuilding the public transportation infrastructure of the city. That came out of that decision and another component of the same decision - you can go check that speech that Frank Sargent gave - was that the only highways that would continue to be studied within Route 128 would be the depression and widening of the Central Artery and the extension of I-90 over to Logan in an additional tunnel, the two components that are today called the Big Dig. Those were really part of that, if you will, anti-highway - [...] "anti-highway's" [...] probably the wrong name - pro-city decision that was made by Frank Sargent to shift towards a transportation strategy that would build the city instead of destroying it.And a major component of that was, stop building destructive roads. Another major component was, put a lot of money into improving public transportation, and the third component that we're seeing built now is, take the existing Central Artery that's there and fix it. I mean fix it both from a transportation point of view, because it doesn't work, but also fix what it did to the city by etting it underground and <b>knit</b> the city <b>back</b> together again. That was a very thrilling moment in my life, when Sargent did it. And I've always respected him a great deal because of the courage that it took to do that.|$|R
