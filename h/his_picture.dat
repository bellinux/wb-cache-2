50|$|Michael Maschka is a {{representative}} of Fantastic Realism. The formal approach in <b>his</b> <b>pictures</b> is realistic and {{is influenced by the}} care that the Old Masters took. He meticulously applies the techniques of the Old Masters to underline the message in <b>his</b> <b>pictures.</b> The viewer should be beguiled by the puzzles that <b>his</b> fantastic <b>pictures</b> present and by the sensuality that is tangible. He uses the vocabulary of the visible reality to trace the invisible structures of a spiritual reality that he has perceived. The motif nudity which appears in many of <b>his</b> <b>pictures</b> does not represent a projection surface for sexuality but is a symbol for naturalness and vulnerability. The female figure appears in <b>his</b> <b>pictures</b> {{in the form of the}} anima, the unconscious side of the soul of the male. By means of painting and etching he tries to bring out the unveiled and vulnerable self and to present it pictorially. In doing so he wants to bring the inner and outer picture into harmony.|$|R

5|$|Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience (1974) is Goffman's {{attempt to}} explain how {{conceptual}} frames – ways to organize experience – structure an individual's perception of society. This book is thus about the organization of experience rather than the organization of society. A frame {{is a set of}} concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals, groups and societies. Frame analysis, then, is the study of the organization of social experience. To illustrate the concept of the frame, Goffman gives the example of a picture frame: a person uses the frame (which represents structure) to hold together <b>his</b> <b>picture</b> (which represents the content) of what he is experiencing in his life.|$|E
