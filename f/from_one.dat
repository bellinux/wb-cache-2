5|$|Any general {{property}} of Banach spaces {{continues to hold}} for Hilbert spaces. The open mapping theorem states that a continuous surjective linear transformation <b>from</b> <b>one</b> Banach space to another is an open mapping meaning that it sends open sets to open sets. A corollary is the bounded inverse theorem, that a continuous and bijective linear function <b>from</b> <b>one</b> Banach space to another is an isomorphism (that is, a continuous linear map whose inverse is also continuous). This theorem is considerably simpler to prove {{in the case of}} Hilbert spaces than in general Banach spaces. The open mapping theorem is equivalent to the closed graph theorem, which asserts that a function <b>from</b> <b>one</b> Banach space to another is continuous if and only if its graph is a closed set. In the case of Hilbert spaces, this is basic in the study of unbounded operators (see closed operator).|$|E
