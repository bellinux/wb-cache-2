5|$|A <b>gun</b> in the Czech Republic is {{available}} to anybody subject to acquiring a shall issue firearms license first. <b>Gun</b> licenses may be obtained in a way very similar to a driving license – by passing a <b>gun</b> proficiency exam, medical examination and having a clean criminal record. Unlike in most other European countries, the Czech <b>gun</b> legislation also permits a citizen to carry a concealed weapon for self-defense – 240,000 out of some 300,000 legal <b>gun</b> owners have concealed carry permit. The vast majority of Czech <b>gun</b> owners possess their firearms for protection, with hunting and sport shooting being less common.|$|E
5|$|Abramski v. United States, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court found that making {{arrangements}} for a straw purchase of a <b>gun</b> is in violation of the <b>Gun</b> Control Act of 1968, and is different from re-selling or gifting a previously purchased <b>gun.</b> In the Abramski case, a former police officer from Virginia took advantage of a local discount to buy a <b>gun</b> for his uncle and later transferred it to Pennsylvania—the uncle's residence—using the appropriate federal procedure. During the purchase, Abramski falsely declared that he is purchasing the <b>gun</b> for himself.|$|E

5|$|As {{the series}} {{production}} of the PS-2 <b>gun</b> was delayed, the Main Artillery Agency of the RKKA gave preference to a new <b>gun.</b> It {{was developed by the}} Artillery Design Office of the Bolshevik Factory, constructed from parts taken from the previously purchased German 37mm anti-tank <b>gun</b> developed by Rheinmetall and the PS-2 <b>gun.</b> This system was successfully tested and the Artillery Factory No. 8 named after M. Kalinin started its series production under the designator B-3 (5K). The B-3 <b>gun</b> had less recoil and a smaller breech compared to the PS-2, so it could be easily mounted in the normal machine <b>gun</b> turret of the T-26. The first twin-turreted T-26 was armed with a B-3 <b>gun</b> in the right turret in late 1931. Unfortunately, series {{production of the}} B-3 <b>gun</b> proceeded slowly due to poor production standards (none of 225 guns produced in 1931 were accepted by army representatives; it took until 1933 to complete the original order for 300 guns placed in August 1931). Completed B-3 guns were mounted on BT-2 light tanks after mid-1932. This meant that twin-turreted T-26 tanks continued to be equipped with old 37mm Hotchkiss (PS-1) guns. As production of the PS-1 <b>gun</b> had ended, some guns were taken from military supply depots and scrapped MS-1(T-18) tanks.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1937, {{there was}} an effort to equip many tanks with a second machine <b>gun</b> {{in the rear of the}} turret and an {{anti-aircraft}} machine <b>gun</b> on top of it, as well as the addition of two searchlights above the <b>gun</b> for night gunnery, a new VKU-3 command system, and a TPU-3 intercom. Some tanks had a vertically stabilised TOP-1 <b>gun</b> telescopic sight. Ammunition stowage for the main <b>gun</b> was improved from 122 rounds to 147. In 1938, the cylindrical turret was replaced with a conical turret, with the same 45mm model 1934 <b>gun.</b> Some T-26s mod. 1938/1939, equipped with radio set, had a PTK commander's panoramic sight.|$|E

5|$|Production of the German Leopard 2 {{and the new}} 120mm tank <b>gun</b> {{began in}} 1979, {{fulfilling}} an order for the German Army. Although the American M1 Abrams was originally armed with the M68A1 105mm <b>gun</b> (a version of the L7), the United States Army had planned to fit the tank with a larger main <b>gun</b> at a later date, and the tank's turret had been designed to accommodate a larger 120mm <b>gun.</b> The larger <b>gun</b> was integrated into the M1A1 Abrams, with the first vehicle coming off the production line in 1985 The <b>gun,</b> known as the M256, {{was based on the}} L/44 tank <b>gun,</b> although manufactured at Watervliet Arsenal and modified to increase the resistance of the barrels to fracture and fatigue.

5|$|Since the mid-1990s, <b>gun</b> control {{advocates have}} voiced {{concern over the}} {{perceived}} loophole in legislation, and campaigned to require background checks and record-keeping for all <b>gun</b> sales.

500|$|The ships all {{had their}} {{armament}} repeatedly revised throughout their careers. By 1905, each ship had had {{two of the}} 15cm <b>guns</b> replaced with two additional 12cm <b>guns,</b> and their secondary battery was standardized at eight 57mm <b>guns</b> and eight 37mm <b>guns,</b> {{with the exception of}} Puglia, which had six and two <b>guns,</b> respectively. Puglia had also had her two torpedo tubes removed by this point. In 1914, Liguria had all of her 15cm <b>guns</b> removed, along with six of the 37mm <b>guns.</b> [...] Her armament was reduced further in 1917 when she was refitted as a minelayer; at this point, she mounted only six 12cm <b>guns</b> and two 37mm <b>guns.</b> Starting in 1915, Etruria and Lombardia were equipped with only six 12cm <b>guns,</b> six 57mm <b>guns</b> for Etruria and eight for Lombardia, two 37mm <b>guns,</b> and their torpedo tubes.

5|$|T-26 model 1931 with <b>gun</b> plus machine <b>gun</b> armament: twin-turreted {{version with}} a 37mm <b>gun</b> {{in the right}} turret (some modern sources mention this tank as T-26 model 1932). There were two models of 37mm guns in the USSR {{suitable}} for mounting in light tanks at that time—the Hotchkiss <b>gun</b> (or its Soviet improved variant PS-1), and the more powerful PS-2 <b>gun</b> developed by P. Syachentov. The latter was superior, but only experimental models existed. Therefore, the first 10 pre-production T-26s, which had a design identical to the Vickers 6-Ton, were equipped with a Hotchkiss <b>gun</b> in the right turret to increase firepower compared to the machine <b>gun</b> armed Vickers tank. The experimental PS-2 <b>gun</b> was mounted on only three T-26 tanks, the right turrets of which were replaced with small <b>gun</b> turrets from the T-35-1 (prototype of the T-35 heavy tank).|$|E

5|$|The <b>Gun</b> Court is {{the branch}} of the Jamaican {{judicial}} system that tries criminal cases involving firearms.

500|$|The first {{design was}} armed with four [...] <b>guns</b> in two twin turrets, four [...] <b>guns</b> in single turrets, and eight [...] <b>guns</b> in casemates. The second design {{retained}} the 28 and 24cm <b>guns</b> {{as in the}} first version, though altered the tertiary <b>guns</b> to twelve [...] <b>guns.</b> The third design, representative of the new dreadnought type of battleship that was being contemplated in other navies, featured eight 28cm <b>guns</b> in four twin turrets, one fore, one aft, and two wing turrets. The heavy secondary <b>guns</b> were dispensed with altogether, and the light-caliber <b>guns</b> were increased to sixteen 10cm <b>guns.</b> The fourth design was {{a variation on the}} third type; the eight 28cm <b>guns</b> were replaced by six [...] <b>guns,</b> in two twin turrets and two single turrets. The 10cm <b>guns</b> remained the same. The final design mounted four 30.5cm <b>guns</b> in two twin turrets, eight 19cm <b>guns</b> in four wing turrets, and twelve 10cm <b>guns</b> in casemates.
