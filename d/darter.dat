5|$|Red-veined <b>Darter</b> – {{following}} influxes {{in previous}} years, this species, like Yellow-winged <b>Darter,</b> has formed temporary breeding colonies. However, since the mid-1990s, {{the number of}} these colonies has increased and many have continued to be present from year-to-year, so this species is now better regarded as a successful colonist.|$|E

5|$|An October 2001 {{survey of}} Mahanoy Creek {{identified}} {{two species of}} fish each at Ashland and Girardville. There were 20 individuals at the latter location and 22 at the former. There were also 13 species and 134 individuals at Gowen City, and 14 species and 545 individuals at the creek's mouth. Additionally, 1003 individuals and 20 species of fish were observed {{at the mouth of}} the tributary Schwaben Creek. White Suckers were found at each of the aforementioned sites. Other fish species found on Mahanoy Creek and Schwaben Creek include the swallowtail shiner, the rosyface shiner, the river chub, the banded <b>darter,</b> and the shield <b>darter.</b> Brown trout, longnose dace, and eastern blacknose dace have also been observed in the watershed. Historically, deer came to the creek to consume salt.|$|E
50|$|Niangua <b>darters</b> {{can live}} {{four or more}} years, but few survive longer than two years. Young <b>darters</b> reach sexual {{maturity}} after one year. Niangua <b>darters</b> eat the nymphs of stoneflies and mayflies, and other aquatic insects.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. —Although the {{efficacy}} {{and design of}} terrestrial movement corridors have received considerable attention, the potential role of corridors in connecting stream habitats has not. We studied the movements of three benthic species of fish, fantail <b>darters</b> Etheostoma flabellare, riverweed <b>darters</b> E. podostemone, and Roanoke <b>darters</b> Percina roanoka, among suitable mesohabitat patches (i. e., riffles) through adjacent, less suitable pools in the South Fork Roanoke River, Virginia. We constructed movement corridors of overhead cover in four pools and compared rates of movement through these pools with those through four control pools without corridors. Movement rates were significantly greater through pools with corridors than through control pools for riverweed and Roanoke <b>darters</b> but equivalent through connected and unconnected pools for fantail <b>darters.</b> Interspecific difference...|$|R
5|$|More {{fish have}} been {{discovered}} in the newly daylighted section of the river. Baby eastern blacknose dace and tessellated <b>darter</b> have been spotted in the river in addition to trout. In addition, wood frogs, eastern painted turtles, and redbreast sunfish live in the river too. All of these species have been hurt by the industrialization of the river.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies become scarce {{at higher}} latitudes. They are not native to Iceland, but {{individuals}} are occasionally swept in by strong winds, including a Hemianax ephippiger native to North Africa, and an unidentified <b>darter</b> species. In Kamchatka, {{only a few}} species of dragonfly including the treeline emerald Somatochlora arctica and some aeshnids such as Aeshna subarctica are found, possibly because of the low temperature of the lakes there. The treeline emerald {{is also found in}} northern Alaska, within the Arctic Circle, making it the most northerly of all dragonflies.|$|E
5|$|The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, comma, hummingbird hawk-moth, broad-bordered bee hawk-moth and {{ghost moth}} are {{sometimes}} {{seen in the}} woods with the common butterfly and moth species, and a clouded yellow or Camberwell beauty may also occur in some years. Grayling, small heath and common blue butterflies {{can be found in the}} dunes, where there is also a large antlion colony, making Holkham one of only two locations for this predatory insect in the UK. Dragonflies include the migrant hawker, southern hawker and ruddy <b>darter.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Large <b>darters</b> are {{susceptible}} to internal parasitism by flukes and nematodes. [...] External parasites such as black spot disease caused by Metacercariae flukes and piscicolid leeches also affect snubnose <b>darters.</b>|$|R
50|$|At adulthood, goldstripe <b>darters</b> {{typically}} {{range from}} 35 to 55 mm in length. Two {{of the largest}} goldstripe <b>darters</b> recorded were a female measuring 61.8 mm and a male measuring 67 mm.|$|R
50|$|Identified rare {{fish in the}} Buffalo include eight {{varieties}} of <b>Darters,</b> one catfish (Saddled Madtom), and one Cavefish (Southern Cavefish). Most of the identified <b>darters</b> are listed as either Threatened or Endangered by either the State or Federal government.|$|R
5|$|A {{variety of}} water birds {{can be seen}} around the lake including: great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus) and little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis), {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocoracidae), mute swan (Cygnus olor), Canada goose (Branta canadensis), duck (Anatidae), shoveller (Anas clypeata) and gadwall (Anas strepera). The common buzzard (Buteo buteo) {{can be seen on}} the surrounding hills and both Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and kestrel breed. Occasional visitors include: osprey ("Pandion haeliatis"), goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo), nuthatch and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major). The ruddy <b>darter</b> dragonfly (Sympetrum sanguineum) can also be seen. In the wood at the western end of the lake there are populations of badgers, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and foxes.|$|E
5|$|An insect {{survey in}} September 2009 {{recorded}} 187 beetle species, including two new to Norfolk, the rove beetle Phytosus nigriventris and the fungus beetle Leiodes ciliaris, and two very rarely {{seen in the}} county, the sap beetle Nitidula carnaria and the clown beetle Gnathoncus nanus. There were also 24 types of spider, and the five ant species included the nationally rare Myrmica specioides. The rare millipede Thalassisobates littoralis, a specialist of coastal shingle habitats, was found here in 1972, and a red-veined <b>darter</b> appeared in 2012. Tens of thousands of migrant turnip sawflies were recorded {{for a few days}} in late summer 2006, along with red-eyed damselflies. The silver Y moth also appears in large numbers in some years.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic midges (Chironomidae) {{provide the}} highest {{proportion}} of the fly life of the lake. The trout (Salmonidae) will feed at the surface on these and water boatmen (Corixidae), and below the surface on the caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae and pupae; they will also take the adult caddisflies when they emerge. Other aquatic fauna including daphnia and snails are {{also found in the}} lake. Large populations of dragonflies, including migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta) and significant numbers of ruddy <b>darter</b> (Sympetrum sanguineum), occur at the lake. Eleven species of wainscot moth make their home in the reed beds, including the nationally local brown-veined wainscot (Archanara dissoluta), twin-spotted wainscot (Archanara geminipuncta) and silky wainscot (Chilodes maritimus).|$|E
50|$|Leopard <b>darters</b> {{typically}} live {{less than}} two years, but individuals older than three years have been found. Spawning occurs in March and April, but may occur as early as February, on gravel-bottomed riffles. The fertilised eggs are buried in gravel. The average clutch size is about 65 eggs. Young leopard <b>darters</b> begin to appear in May of each year. Food items include aquatic insects and microcrustaceans. Leopard <b>darters</b> are found in medium to large streams. Typically, they are not found in smaller, headwater streams. From May to February, leopard <b>darters</b> prefer small, noisy pools with a rubble and boulder substrate. Spawning occurs on gravel substrates; however, the dominant riffle substrate may be gravel, rubble, boulder, and bedrock.|$|R
50|$|Adult Niangua <b>darters</b> {{move from}} pools and slow runs to gravel riffles prior to {{spawning}}. The spawning season runs from mid-March to early June, {{but most of}} the breeding occurs in April. After spawning, Niangua <b>darters</b> return to the pools and stream runs.|$|R

5|$|Multifactorial sex {{determination}} occurs in numerous Neotropical species and involves both XY and ZW systems. Multifactorial systems involve rearrangements of sex chromosomes and autosomes. For example, the <b>darter</b> characine has a ZW multifactorial system where the female {{is determined by}} ZW1W2 and the male by ZZ. The wolf fish has a XY multifactorial system where females are determined by X1X1X2X2 and the male by X1X2Y. Some teleosts, such as zebrafish, have a polyfactorial system, where there are several genes which {{play a role in}} determining sex. Environment-dependent {{sex determination}} has been documented in at least 70 species of teleost. Temperature is the main factor, but PH levels, growth rate, density and social environment may also play a role. For the Atlantic silverside, spawning in colder waters creates more females, while warmer waters create more males.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide variety}} of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane {{has been found to}} be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 {{discovered}} the following species on the island: African <b>darter</b> (Anhinga rufa), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).|$|E
5|$|There are a {{total of}} eight species of wild fish in West Creek. Brook trout and brown trout both inhabit West Creek, {{although}} brook trout are slightly more common than brown trout, with nine brook trout and only seven brown trout being observed in a 2010 or 2011 electrofishing survey. Trout are more common upstream of the Pennsylvania Route 239 crossing of the creek than downstream of it. The most common fish in the creek are sculpin, eastern blacknose dace, and cutlips minnows. In the aforementioned electrofishing survey, {{a total of}} 81 sculpin, 34 black-nosed dace, and 17 cutlips minnows were observed. Other species of fish in the watershed include johnny <b>darter,</b> white sucker, and creek chub.|$|E
5000|$|Emerald <b>darters</b> compete heavily {{with other}} benthic {{freshwater}} {{fish in the}} southeastern United States. They are known as opportunistic feeders, relying on food and prey availability which fluctuates drastically throughout seasonal changes. Emerald <b>darters</b> are primarily insectivorous, and depending on size class, 80% to 100% of their diets can consist of small invertebrates. Emerald <b>darters</b> {{can be found in}} a variety of clear freshwater habitats with moderately low siltation. The fish can generally be found in water that ranges from 8 to 45 cm in depth, though they are known to retreat to deeper, rock-lined pools during colder months and when floods alter current velocity. Emerald <b>darters</b> inhabit waters that range from 0 to 25 °C, and can be found in riffles and runways up to 0.61 m/s flow velocity. [...] They prefer streams with open sunlight and dense vegetation.|$|R
50|$|Niangua <b>darters</b> live {{in clear}} upland creeks and small to {{medium-sized}} rivers with slight to moderate currents. They require continuously flowing streams with silt-free gravel and rock bottoms. These streams typically drain hilly areas with chert or dolomite bedrock. Niangua <b>darters</b> are found {{most of the}} year in shallow pools, margins, and stream runs.|$|R
50|$|Western Sand <b>Darters</b> {{primarily}} {{live in the}} Mississippi Basin, {{stretching from}} Minnesota to Louisiana. They tend to accumulate in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Arkansas. In these areas, the populations tend {{to have at least}} 10,000 individuals. Western Sand <b>Darters</b> prefer to live in rivers with gravel or loose sand sediment and moderate to swift currents.|$|R
5|$|Kerala's fauna are {{notable for}} their {{diversity}} and {{high rates of}} endemism: it includes 118 species of mammals (1 endemic), 500 species of birds, 189 species of freshwater fish, 173 species of reptiles (10 of them endemic), and 151 species of amphibians (36 endemic). These are threatened by extensive habitat destruction, including soil erosion, landslides, salinisation, and resource extraction. In the forests, sonokeling, Dalbergia latifolia, anjili, mullumurikku, Erythrina, and Cassia number {{among the more than}} 1,000 species of trees in Kerala. Other plants include bamboo, wild black pepper, wild cardamom, the calamus rattan palm, and aromatic vetiver grass, Vetiveria zizanioides. Indian elephant, Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, Nilgiri tahr, common palm civet, and grizzled giant squirrels are also found in the forests. Reptiles include the king cobra, viper, python, and mugger crocodile. Kerala's birds include the Malabar trogon, the great hornbill, Kerala laughingthrush, <b>darter</b> and southern hill myna. In the lakes, wetlands, and waterways, fish such as kadu; stinging catfish and choottachi; orange chromide—Etroplus maculatus are found.|$|E
5|$|The {{proliferation}} of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) in central Florida {{is a major}} attraction for fishermen {{from all over the}} country. The St. Johns is home to 183 species of fish, 55 of which appear in the main stem of the river. One, the southern tessellated <b>darter</b> (Etheostoma olmstedi) is found only in the Ocklawaha. Some are marine species that either migrate upriver to spawn or have found spring-fed habitats that are high in salinity, such as a colony of Atlantic stingrays (Dasyatis sabina) that live in Lake Washington in the upper basin. Ocean worms, snails, and white-fingered mud crabs (Rhithropanopeus harrisii) have also been found far upriver where tidal influences are rare. In contrast, American eels (Anguilla rostrata) live in the St. Johns and Ocklawaha and spawn in the Sargasso Sea {{in the middle of the}} Atlantic Ocean. After a year living in the ocean, many of them find their way back to the St. Johns to live, then, prompted by the phases of the moon, make the return journey to spawn and die.|$|E
25|$|Endangered species {{known to}} occur in the Daniel Boone National Forest include Indiana Bat, Cumberland <b>darter,</b> snuffbox, sheepnose, and fluted kidneyshell. Threatened species known {{to occur in}} the Daniel Boone National Forest include White-haired goldenrod, rabbitsfoot, and {{northern}} long-eared bat. The Cumberland arrow <b>darter</b> and the Kentucky arrow <b>darter</b> are currently proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act of 1969.|$|E
50|$|The Sulae {{are also}} united by their {{characteristic}} display behavior, which {{agrees with the}} phylogeny as laid out by anatomical and DNA sequence data. While the darters' lack of many display behaviors is shared with gannets (and that of a few with cormorants), these are all symplesiomorphies that are absent in frigatebirds, tropicbirds and pelicans also. Like cormorants but unlike other birds, <b>darters</b> use their hyoid bone to stretch the gular sac in display. Whether the pointing display of mates is another synapomorphy of <b>darters</b> and cormorants that was dropped again {{in some of the}} latter, or whether it evolved independently in <b>darters</b> and those cormorants that do it, is not clear. The male raised-wing display seems to be a synapomorphy of the Sulae; like almost all cormorants and shags but unlike almost all gannets and boobies, <b>darters</b> keep their wrists bent as they lift the wings in display, but their alternating wing-waving, which they also show before take-off, is unique. That they often balance with their outstretched wings during walking is probably an autapomorphy of <b>darters,</b> necessitated by their being plumper than the other Sulae.|$|R
