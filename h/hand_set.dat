The trains {{originally}} ran on the right <b>hand</b> <b>set</b> of rails, an unusual practice in England, however the railway later changed to left-hand running with the connection of the MB at Clifton. Ten trains ran in each direction per weekday, and two on Sundays. The journey from Salford to Bolton took about 35minutes.|$|E
500|$|Hand's {{democratic}} {{respect for}} legislation {{meant that he}} hardly ever struck down a law. Whenever his decisions went against the government, he based them only on the boundaries of law in particular cases. He adhered to the doctrine of presumptive validity, which assumes that legislators {{know what they are}} doing when they pass a law. Even when a law was uncongenial to him, or when it seemed contradictory, <b>Hand</b> <b>set</b> himself to interpret the legislative intent. Sometimes, however, he was obliged to draw the line between federal and state laws, as in United States v. Schechter Poultry. In this important case, he ruled that a New Deal law on working conditions did not apply to a New York poultry firm that conducted its business only within the state. Hand wrote in his opinion: [...] "It is always a serious thing to declare any act of Congress unconstitutional, and especially in a case where {{it is part of a}} comprehensive plan for the rehabilitation of the nation as a whole. With the wisdom of that plan we have nothing whatever to do..." ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{utility and}} discriminatory {{pattern of the}} clock face drawing test in ADHD is unclear. This study {{therefore}} compared Clock Face Drawing test performance in children with ADHD and controls.   Material & methods: 95 children with ADHD and 191 school children were matched for gender ratio and age. ADHD symptoms severities were assessed using DSM-IV ADHD checklist and their intellectual functioning was assessed. The participants completed three clock-drawing tasks, and the following four functions were assessed: Contour score, Numbers score, <b>Hands</b> <b>setting</b> score, and Center score    Results: All the subscales scores of the three clock drawing tests of the ADHD group were {{lower than that of}} the control group. In ADHD children, inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity scores were not related with free drawn clock test scores. When pre-drawn contour test was performed, inattentiveness score was statistically associated with Number score. None of the other variables of age, gender, intellectual functioning, and hand use preference were associated with Numbers score. In pre-drawn clock, no association of ADHD symptoms with any CDT subscales was significant. In addition, more errors are observed with free drawn clock and Pre-drawn contour than pre-drawn clock.  &nbsp;  Conclusion: Putting Numbers and <b>Hands</b> <b>setting</b> are more sensitive measures to screen ADHD than Contour and Center drawing. Test performance, except <b>Hands</b> <b>setting,</b> may have already reached a developmental plateau. It is probable that <b>Hand</b> <b>setting</b> deficit in children with ADHD may not decrease from age 8 to 14 years. Performance of children with ADHD is associated with the complexity of CDT...|$|R

60|$|Marie at once rose, {{and taking}} the child's <b>hand</b> <b>set</b> out. They had to {{traverse}} {{the greater part of}} Paris to reach their destination. It was a trial for Marie, who had never before been in the streets of Paris except with her mother and closely followed by two domestics, and even then only through the quiet streets of a fashionable quarter. However, she went steadily forward, tightly holding Virginie's hand and trying to walk as if accustomed to them in the thick heavy shoes which felt so strangely different to those which she was in the habit of wearing.|$|E
60|$|The woman {{promptly}} {{produced a}} cotton shirt, which the youth tore up into long strips. Making {{a pad of}} one of these, he placed it under the boy's arm-pit despite of sobs and resistance. This pad acted as a fulcrum on which the arm rested as a lever. Pressing the elbow close to the boy's side he thus forced the shoulder outwards, and, with his left <b>hand,</b> <b>set</b> the bone with its two broken ends together. To secure it in this position he bound the arm pretty firmly to the boy's body, {{so that he could}} not move a muscle of the left arm or shoulder.|$|E

60|$|The Roberta {{tightened}} to her chains {{when the}} second head of the hurricane hit, as did schooner after schooner in swift succession. The sea, white with fury, boiled in tiny, spitting wavelets. The deck of the Malahini vibrated under the men's feet. The taut-stretched halyards beat a tattoo against the masts, and all the rigging, as if smote by some mighty <b>hand,</b> <b>set</b> up a wild thrumming. It was impossible to face the wind and breathe. Mulhall, crouching with the others behind {{the shelter of the}} cabin, discovered this, and his lungs were filled in an instant with so great a volume of driven air which he could not expel that he nearly strangled ere he could turn his head away.|$|E
60|$|Thinking it over afterward, I {{acknowledged}} {{to myself that}} the English Captain--although he was the handsomest man of the two, and possessed the smoothest manners--had failed, nevertheless, to overcome my shyness. The American traveler's unaffected sincerity and good-humor, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>set</b> me quite at my ease. I could {{look at him and}} thank him, and feel amused at his sympathy with the grimace I had made, after swallowing the ill-flavored waters. And yet, while I lay awake at night, wondering whether we should meet our new acquaintances on the next day, it was the English Captain that I most wanted to see again, and not the American traveler! At the time, I set this down to nothing more important than my own perversity. Ah, dear! dear! I know better than that now.|$|E
60|$|The wind freshened as {{they crossed}} a rock-fringed bay where a famous {{emigrant}} ship went down. Sparkling ripples flecked the swell, which presently began to roll in short angry waves.

After a time, Marston and the paid <b>hand</b> <b>set</b> a smaller jib and hauled down the topsail, and when they had finished Bob stood on deck looking about. The sea ahead was white and Red Rose rolled hard when the rising combers picked her up. Astern, the dinghy sheered about and lifted half her length {{out of the water}} when she felt the strain on the rope. Once or twice she surged forward on a wave, as if she were going to leap on board. Marston had seen enough and jumped into the cockpit.|$|E
