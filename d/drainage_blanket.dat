40|$|Problems {{related to}} seepage through earth dams {{constitute}} more than 40 % {{of the sources}} of observed damages throughout the world. A particular attention is given to how to minimize the effects due to seepage by using an adequate means of drainage to ensure the hydraulic and mechanical stabilities of the dam. In the homogeneous earth dams, the filtering <b>drainage</b> <b>blanket</b> is used with dimensions and location in the backfill determined by some unreliable methods. In this work a simple chart is developed in order to effectively locate the filtering <b>drainage</b> <b>blanket</b> along with a graph giving its length. This graph was obtained after having carried out a computer simulation of a great number of earth dams in which the total height, the embankment slopes, and the material characteristics were varied. For each dam, the drain length is changed within the acceptable limits of the hydraulic stability and the landslide stability of the downstream side embankment which is calculated...|$|E
40|$|For proper {{design of}} a {{drainage}} system that utilizes lined canals, knowledge of the seepage into a soil substrate/drainage region is necessary so that the <b>drainage</b> <b>blanket</b> and /or filter type and thickness, {{and the size of}} collector pipes can all be designed. The work presented in this paper is based on the problem of steady-state seepage from a hypothetical irrigation canal into the substrate/drainage region towards asymmetrical trapezoidal concrete-lined canal. The problem is solved using a finite element based software program to determine the flow volume into the drainage region. Typical values of soil permeability coefficients of single and two-layer subsoil from literature are used along with experimental results of a laboratory study done for the design seepage coefficient of clay-cement concrete as lining material. The water flow effect of canal seepage discharge analyzed shows that the effectiveness of canal lining in reducing seepage is less when drainage distance is large. This study may contribute towards a better understanding on design of hydraulic conductivity under hydraulic structures. It will systematically enumerate the many, often straightforward factors that determine coefficient of permeability for compliance purposes. This could also involve a re-estimation of the values of the permeability coefficient and the factors on which the coefficient depends...|$|E
40|$|Sanitary {{landfill}} {{is still}} the most cost-effective and appropriate method for waste disposal in Iraq. The municipal solid waste has high moisture content of about 49. 1 % and density of 162. 6 kg/m 3. The organic fraction reaches about 79 %. Based on the studies and reports of study area, the average waste generation rate was 0. 45 kg/capita/day. The design of the base liner, leachate collection system, and final cover system for the study area landfill is described in this paper. Since the landfill is located in an arid environment, leachate generation is low and potential infiltration through the lining system is minimal. A 250 mm diameter drainage pipes have longitudinal slope 1 % to reduce sedimentation and allow adequate flow capacity. Leachate will be collected through 10 mm pipe perforations in four rows, set 900 apart on the pipe circumference and spaced 300 mm center to center. A minimum 500 mm thick high-permeability granular <b>drainage</b> <b>blanket</b> (anticipated to be 25 to 100 mm in size) placed across the entire base of the landfill. A leachate collection system is extending over the entire base of a landfill and, if below ground, extends up its sloping side walls. The drainage layer is consisting of granular materials at least 300 mm thick and has a hydraulic conductivity of at least 1 * 10 - 3 m/s. HDPE line...|$|E
500|$|Care {{was taken}} to {{excavate}} the entire lake floor {{to a depth of}} at least [...] to provide sufficient clearance for boat keels. Another reason given for this was that mosquitoes would not breed nor would weeds grow at such a depth. A soil conservation program was launched in the catchment and bed load traps were installed to minimise loss of earth. The traps have been used as a source of sand and gravel for building sites. <b>Drainage</b> <b>blankets</b> were used to prevent the loss of groundwater beneath the lake.|$|R
5000|$|Completed in 1955 by Swansea City Council, the dam is {{approximately}} 100 ft (30m) in height and 1600 ft (480m) in width. It {{was the first}} example in the UK of an earth dam with horizontal <b>drainage</b> <b>blankets.</b> [...] The reservoir covers some 280 acre of land. It can be located just off the minor road between Trecastle and Llanddeusant, 7 mi west of Sennybridge. The reservoir is now owned by Welsh Water and the surrounding woods by Natural Resources Wales. Most of the area is open to walkers and cyclists via forest tracks and other footpaths. There are several small car parks for visitors. The reservoir is stocked with fresh water fish such as trout and can be fished with an appropriate licence.|$|R
40|$|The Plavinas hydro-electric {{powerplant}} in Latvia {{is located}} within a complex hydro-geologic environment. The powerhouse/spillway structure {{is founded on}} a buried valley, filled with glacial till and having pressurized aquifers on its flanks. Pressure and seepage control is by means of <b>drainage</b> <b>blankets</b> and wells in the foundation and relief wells on the downstream right bank. A large number of piezometers monitors the pressure in the various stratigraphic units. For {{the design of a}} reserve spillway required to ensure safety against flood events, the existence of highly pressured zones at the contact of the till with the pressurized aquifers on the slope of the buried valley was an important geological consideration. Hydro-geological investigations revealed that these zones are hydraulically connected. The stilling basin of the reserve spillway will be close to the buried valley but construction activities must not interfere with pressurized strata. Real-time monitoring of piezometric heads by means of an automatic data acquisition system will be used as a tool to ensure safety during construction activities...|$|R
40|$|Slope {{failure is}} one of the most {{prominent}} difficulties experienced in geotechnical engineering where catastrophes lead to the destruction of property and ultimately significant loss of life. One such salient example of this was the Oso slope failure which occurred 6. 4 km east of Oso, Washington, USA on the 22 nd of March 2014. This disaster, deemed to be the single deadliest landslide event in United States history claimed the lives of 26 people whilst 7 people remain unaccounted for. The purpose of this dissertation is to accurately construct a model earth dam and design an experimental methodology that produces consistent and comparable results in terms of its slope stability. The experimental results are critically compared with the theoretical results produced by the SLIDE slope stability software, with the overall objective of determining if computer analysis can accurately predict the behaviour of a model earth dam. This dissertation was compiled by completing an extensive review of 4 salient method of slices available that can be applied to determine the stability or instability of the slope. A similar amount of experimental data collection was also completed to enable a comparable dataset of results to be compiled. This report determines that the SLIDE program does accurately predict the behaviour of a model earth dam with downstream slopes of 1 : 1, 1 : 1. 5, 1 : 1. 75 and 1 : 2 respectively. However, during the experimental testing of the 1 : 2. 5 and 1 : 3 downstream slopes it was observed that only initial erosion at the toe takes place. The SLIDE program applies its design principles and determines that the slope should fail. The experimental results contradict this as the slopes remained stable after the initial erosion subsided. An investigation was conducted to determine if the addition of a <b>drainage</b> <b>blanket</b> would negate the effect of erosion by altering the water flow path exit location. The result of this was conclusive and the dam was deemed to be stable at a downstream slope of 1 : 2. 5...|$|E
40|$|At present {{there is}} no {{systematic}} approach {{for the design of}} highway embankments in Bangladesh. To address this issue, this thesis presents a methodology which can be used for the design of embankments in countries with similar conditions to those experienced in Bangladesh. Such conditions include: the large seasonal variation in flood water levels, which can reach up to 5 m in height; the soft soils on and from the embankments are mainly constructed, and; the prevailing socio- economic climate. The large seasonal variation in flood water levels coupled with the underlying soft (clay) soils results in mainly two types of embankment failure. These are broadly associated with excessive amounts and slow rates of embankment foundation settlement and embankment stability. The latter includes slope failure and foundation bearing capacity failure. The chosen methodology to prevent these types of failure took into account the prevailing socio-economic situation. That is the methods selected had to be sustainable, capable of being implemented and economically viable. Design methods were developed to keep the embankment within the allowable settlement limit and make it stable. These methods include performing settlement and stability analyses respectively. To this end, two techniques described in literature, finite difference settlement analysis and Bishop’s method for stability analysis implemented in commercially available software (Settle 3 D and OASYS SLOPE respectively), were selected from a number of options studied. In addition to the two methods described above, two other methods were identified where the commercial software is not available. These are less accurate and may not be used under certain conditions are easily implemented in a spreadsheet. For settlement analysis Standard method and to perform stability calculations Low’s method were chosen. For the former and Low’s method and developed stability chart were proposed for stability analyses. Under some conditions the developed design processes may identify that some form of remediation is required. Where it is found necessary to increase the rate of settlement of the embankment and foundation beyond that possible naturally prefabricated vertical drain (PVD) and the addition of a surcharge with a horizontal <b>drainage</b> <b>blanket</b> were identified as suitable options. Additional methods to improve stability include the addition of geo-fabrics, stage construction, the use of geo-cells and pressure berms. The top of the embankment, or subgrade, acts as a platform for the pavement and whose properties are the input for pavement design. To assist the pavement design process therefore, a procedure has also been developed in the research to specify appropriate subgrade properties. These included the use of appropriate materials and compacted by suitable amounts so that the fill does not undergo excessive settlement during the life of the pavement. Suitable amounts of compactive effort, layer thickness and construction moisture content were included as part of the specification with appropriate values based on previous research findings...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} has addressed typical geological complexities through performance evaluation of selective foundation seepage control features for embankment dams on deep permeable strata. The study {{is based on}} an intricate case history of Satpara Dam Project founded over moraines. Seepage control measures for Satpara dam foundations included upstream extension of the dam core as an impervious blanket with a partial cutoff at its upstream end. Seepage modelling was carried for â€˜as-designedâ€™ seepage mitigation measures under 2 -D sectional flow model assumptions for different case scenarios using SEEP/W. In-situ permeability test results from pre-construction exploratory investigations of the project, ranging over several logarithmic orders of magnitude, were scrutinised for identification of a representative dataset for assignment of Kvalues while characterising spatial variability. Relative seepage sensitivity analyses were made using â€˜percentileâ€™ values from the two-layered â€˜pervious zone in homogeneousâ€™ foundation representation approach and computed values from the multi-zoned â€˜ROCKWORKS modelledâ€™ multi-zoned foundation representation approach. Comparative inferences considered theoretically acceptable limits in averting piping initiation for the adopted seepage control measures. The refinement in K-assumptions from the layered to the multi-zoned approach influenced and enhanced scale of magnitudes and rate of change of computed gradients and hydraulic heads along their distributions and trends at different points of consideration along the flow direction. The adopted seepage control scheme reduced the computed hydraulic gradients to 73. 5 % and the head potential to 72 % at toe of core relative to no seepage control measures. Available project data from five years of consecutive operation (for five impoundings during 2007 - 2011) showed that conservation level and consequently a steady state condition was not achieved. Effectiveness of the adopted seepage control measures at Satpara Dam was evaluated through comparative response of instruments installed across the cutoff wall, for upstream and downstream observations at two different depth zones, and along the flow path in the foundations upstream and downstream of the main dam axis. Piezometeric data from 27 selected responsive foundation piezometers covering the project area was used to develop percent potential contour plot plans, corresponding to selected pseudo-steady state reservoir levels and for a reservoir level common to the last three impounding stages. Evaluation of head differentials and percent potential distributions also provided evidence of cross flow influences, indicating 3 -D flow in the dam foundation domain. Pseudo-steady state reservoir levels defined new loading conditions, which were used to extend the 2 -D â€˜as designedâ€™ SEEP/W model and additionally simulate a 3 -D seepage model using FEFLOW. Simulated results based on the multi-zoned preconstruction foundation representation could not replicate the observed â€˜pseudosteadyâ€™ foundation response. It was assessed that applied heads had likely caused redistribution of unsupported fines, at probable locations associated with higher potential drops and concentrated potential contours. The cutoff wall proximity and foundations underlying the <b>drainage</b> <b>blanket</b> were accordingly identified to induce higher gradients susceptible for subsequently dislodging fines. An inverse 2 -D modelling approach was implied to correspondingly re-adjust K-values in the sectional multi-zoned pre-construction foundation representation. This helped improve related subsurface perceptions of post-construction foundation behaviour...|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} and movement of water within a waste landfill {{are important for}} two main reasons. First, water represents a major potential pathway for pollution of the surrounding environment. As liquid passes through the waste to emerge as leachate, it dissolves or carries in suspension substances that could cause contamination through interaction with the natural groundwater. Artificial and natural barriers help to prevent this, but it is usually also necessary to control leachate pressures (levels) – usually by pumping from wells or <b>drainage</b> <b>blankets</b> – so as to minimise head differences acting on a sealing layer or a natural barrier boundary. Leachate movement through the waste mass in response to pumping {{is controlled by the}} hydraulic conductivity or permeability of the waste. The distribution of permeability within the waste, which will vary as a result of anisotropy, heterogeneity, partial saturation and changes in waste density or effective stress, is also of vital importance. The total and drainable porosity of waste will control the rate of build up of leachate levels in response to infiltration or other water inputs, and the rate of decline when dewatering a site. It is also necessary to understand and control the impact of pore pressures on mechanical stability. Secondly, water and water flow are essential to achieving landfill completion, i. e. bringing it to a stable, non-polluting state in a controlled way. Municipal solid wastes (MSW) have for the past 50 years contained a high proportion of biodegradable components: water is essential to the biochemical decomposition of organic substances (Pohland 1975; Leckie and Pacey 1979; Klink and Ham 1982). Water flow is also needed for the leaching out of soluble compounds, even in an inert or organically stabilised waste...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{long history}} of <b>drainage</b> of <b>blanket</b> peat but few studies of the {{long-term}} hydrological impact of drainage. This paper aims to test differences in runoff production processes between intact and drained blanket peat catchments and determine whether there have been any long-term changes in stream flow since drainage occurred. Hillslope runoff processes and stream discharge were measured in four blanket peat catchments. Two catchments were drained with open-cut ditches in the 1950 s. Ditching originally resulted in shorter lag times and flashier storm hydrographs but no change in the annual catchment runoff efficiency. In the period between 2002 and 2004, the hydrographs in the drained catchments, while still flashy, were less sensitive to rainfall than in the 1950 s and the runoff efficiency had significantly increased. Drains resulted in a distinctive spatial pattern of runoff production across the slopes. Overland flow was significantly lower in the drained catchments where throughflow was more dominant. In the intact peatlands, matrix throughflow produced by peat layers below 10 cm was rare and produced, 1...|$|R
40|$|Open ditch {{drainage}} {{has historically}} been a common land management practice in upland blanket peats, particularly in the UK. However, peatland drainage is now generally considered to have adverse effects on the upland environment, including increased peak flows. As a result, drain blocking has become a common management strategy in the UK over recent years, although there is only anecdotal {{evidence to suggest that}} this might decrease peak flows. The change in the hydrological regime associated with the <b>drainage</b> of <b>blanket</b> peat and the subsequent blocking of drains is poorly understood, therefore a new physics-based model has been developed that allows the exploration of the associated hydrological processes. A series of simulations is used to explore the response of intact, drained and blocked drain sites at field scales. While drainage is generally found to increase peak flows, the effect of drain blocking appears to be dependent on local conditions, sometimes decreasing and sometimes increasing peak flows. Based on insights from these simulations we identify steep smooth drains as those that would experience the greatest reduction in field-scale peak flows if blocked and recommend that future targeted field studies should be focused on examining surface runoff characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Open ditch {{drainage}} is {{a commonly}} implemented land management practice in upland blanket peatlands, {{particularly in the}} UK, where policy decisions between the 1940 s and 1970 s led to widespread drainage of the uplands. The change in the hydrological regime associated with the <b>drainage</b> of <b>blanket</b> peat is poorly understood, yet has perceived importance for flooding, low flows and water quality. We propose a new simplified physics-based model that allows the associated hydrological processes and flow responses to be explored. The model couples four one-dimensional models to represent a three-dimensional hillslope, allowing for the exploration of flow and water table response throughout the model domain {{for a range of}} drainage configurations and peat properties. The model is tested against a data set collected from Oughtershaw Beck, UK, with results showing good model performance for wet periods although less conformity with borehole observations during rewetting periods. A wider exploration of model behaviour indicates that the model is consistent with the hydrological response reported in the literature for a number of drained blanket peat sites, and therefore has potential to provide guidance to decision makers concerning the effects of management practices. Through a global sensitivity analysis, we conclude that further field investigations to assist in the surface and drain roughness parameterisation would help reduce the uncertainty in the model predictions...|$|R
40|$|Restoring {{afforested}} peat bogs: {{results of}} current research The value of peat bogs as open habitats and stores of carbon {{may be lost}} if they are planted with trees. The number of bogs being restored is increasing but still modest in scale relative {{to the area of}} afforested peatland. Research is currently being carried out to determine the feasibility and methodology for restoring afforested bogs. Two experiments were set up to compare a range of methods for managing trees and <b>drainage.</b> In the <b>blanket</b> bog experiment, treatments that involved both felling trees and damming plough furrows were more successful than others in terms of raising the water table. Bog vegetation recovered rapidly in the felled treatments, particularly those with furrows dammed. In the lowland raised bog experiment, the water table rose dramatically in all treatments. Only during a prolonged dry summer was there a difference between treatments, the water table falling deeper in the whole-tree removal than in the fell-to-waste treatment, with conventional harvesting intermediate. Bog vegetation recovered best in the whole-tree removal treatments and least well in the fell-to-waste treatments. Felling is necessary for restoring afforested bogs, but removing lop and top is not. Damming plough furrows can help to restore blanket bog but damming main drains may suffice on lowland raised bogs. Damming furrows is ineffective if the peat is severely cracked. Tree seedlings often colonise bogs undergoing restoration – removing brash mats after harvesting and periodic maintenance should reduce this problem...|$|R
