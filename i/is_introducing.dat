5|$|In 2006, The Royal Bank of Scotland Group {{undertook}} {{the first}} trial of PayPass contactless debit and credit cards in Europe. The bank <b>is</b> <b>introducing</b> Visa Debit cards with the technology for current accounts, {{which can be used}} to pay for purchases up to £30 by tapping an enabled card on the retailer's terminal. In an effort to enhance security, hand-held devices for use with a card to authorise online banking transactions were introduced in 2007. These card readers do not retain personal information but verify numbers during a transaction.|$|E

25|$|By mutating aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, chemists have {{expanded}} the genetic codes of various organisms to include lab-synthesized amino acids {{with all kinds}} of useful properties: photoreactive, metal-chelating, xenon-chelating, crosslinking, spin-resonant, fluorescent, biotinylated, and redox-active amino acids. Another use <b>is</b> <b>introducing</b> amino acids bearing reactive functional groups for chemically modifying the target protein.|$|E
50|$|PET {{beverage}} bottles <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> from 1973. PEEK {{was developed}} by ICI in 1977. HDPE water pipes <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> from 1980. In 1988, a number code for recycling plastics <b>was</b> <b>introduced.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Book Plus Library Management System {{was adopted}} in 1982 and an online public access {{catalogue}} <b>was</b> <b>introduced</b> in 1985.

25|$|Hershey <b>is</b> <b>introducing</b> new pastel-colored {{wrappers}} {{with white}} polka dots {{for the upcoming}} Easter season. This created controversy within the organization because many workers and environmentalists have requested a more environmentally-friendly packaging, which would have eliminated the aluminum wrapping {{and replaced it with}} biodegradable materials. This was supposed to be rolled out on April 1, 2009.|$|E
25|$|St. Paul's Co-educational College was {{established}} in 1915 as St. Paul's Girls College. After temporarily merging with St. Paul's College, the school retained its co-educational status. It {{is one of the}} first schools to convert to the Direct Subsidy Scheme in 2002, and <b>is</b> <b>introducing</b> an International Baccalaureate curriculum. Currently, the primary school section is no longer housed in the same campus as the secondary school, and has moved to a new campus in Wong Chuk Hang.|$|E
25|$|Another {{issue with}} tissue culture <b>is</b> <b>introducing</b> the proper factors or stimuli {{required}} to induce functionality. In many cases, simple maintenance {{culture is not}} sufficient. Growth factors, hormones, specific metabolites or nutrients, chemical and physical stimuli are sometimes required. For example, certain cells respond to changes in oxygen tension {{as part of their}} normal development, such as chondrocytes, which must adapt to low oxygen conditions or hypoxia during skeletal development. Others, such as endothelial cells, respond to shear stress from fluid flow, which is encountered in blood vessels. Mechanical stimuli, such as pressure pulses seem to be beneficial to all kind of cardiovascular tissue such as heart valves, blood vessels or pericardium.|$|E

500|$|It {{was created}} {{on the same}} engine as [...] Game {{developer}} Heavy Iron Studios tweaked the graphics to give the game a sharper and more-imaginative look than Battle for Bikini Bottom. It increased the polygon count, added several racing levels and incorporated many creatures from the film. The game's plot {{was based on the}} film, with SpongeBob and Patrick on a mission taking them outside Bikini Bottom to retrieve Neptune's crown. On October 4, 2004, THQ announced the game's mobile release. Nickelodeon vice-president for new-media business development Paul Jelinek said, [...] "As one of the leading publishers of wireless entertainment content, THQ Wireless <b>is</b> <b>introducing</b> the SpongeBob SquarePants license to a whole new audience of gamers THQ has been a great partner to Nickelodeon over the years {{and we look forward to}} the same standard of excellence with these upcoming SpongeBob SquarePants games for wireless devices." [...] The mobile console was developed by Amplified Games.|$|E
500|$|Regarding Johnny Blaze, Schwartz {{said that}} [...] "Marvel TV <b>is</b> <b>introducing</b> {{the idea of}} {{multiple}} Ghost Riders into its mythology, which {{sets the stage for}} Robbie Reyes not being the only one possessed by the Spirit of Vengeance in this world. That's more than we could have hoped for Agents of SHIELDs take on the iconic Marvel hero." [...] She [...] speculated that a spin-off featuring Blaze and/or Reyes was now a realistic possibility. Buxton said that [...] "Marvel just established a much bigger Ghost Rider mythos that can be explored on TV, in movies, or Netflix and that is really damn exciting." [...] Valentine felt the appearance was a [...] "pretty amazing development", and stated, [...] "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. almost seemed hamstrung by its connections to the Marvel Universe, seemingly unable to make a move without first consulting what precisely was happening in the movie universe. [...] we’re shown what Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. could have been all along: a sister piece that plays to the outer elements of the MCU that the movies haven’t been able to touch." ...|$|E
500|$|Recurring {{characters}} who {{appear in the}} episode are glee club members Brittany (Heather Morris), Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.), Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton) and Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff), former glee club director Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky), football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) and Sue's sister Jean Sylvester (Robin Trocki). Mary Jo Catlett appears as recently widowed teacher Mrs. Carlisle, and Molly Shannon makes her first appearance in a recurring role as new astronomy teacher and badminton coach Brenda Castle. Special guest star Olivia Newton-John appears as herself, portraying the [...] "dark side" [...] of herself; a [...] "mixture of mean and diva". She and Lynch produced an exact re-creation of the original [...] "Physical" [...] video, filming of which took twelve hours. Series musical producer Adam Anders felt that Newton-John's appearance in the episode was organic, explaining: [...] "The best part of Glee <b>is</b> <b>introducing</b> new music to an older generation and old music to a newer generation. There's so much great music. We all listen to music in a vacuum, then we're exposed to things and love it. Olivia Newton-John {{is an example of}} that. It's a perfect marriage between the songs that were chosen and the storyline. When that happens, it moves people." ...|$|E
50|$|Several new {{characters}} <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> in Crisis; the Monitor's assistant, Harbinger, and scientist Pariah played {{major roles}} in the story.

500|$|In Philadelphia, Henry Fairfield Osborn <b>is</b> <b>introducing</b> artist Charles R. Knight to Edward Drinker Cope, a {{paleontologist}} whose {{entire house}} {{is filled with}} bones and specimens. Cope is commissioning a painting, something to [...] "catch the spirit" [...] of the sea creature Elasmosaurus (but has unwittingly mistaken its neck for a tail). Cope then leaves for the West, as the official scientist for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). On the way, he meets Othniel Charles Marsh, a fellow paleontologist, and shows him his dig site at a marl pit in New Jersey; after Cope leaves, Marsh talks to {{the owner of the}} land and pays him off to gain exclusive digging rights. At Fort Bridger, Wyoming, Cope meets Sam Smith, a helper to the USGS. During excavations, Cope finds some of the richest bone veins ever. Sending back carloads of dinosaur bones east by train, Cope encounters Marsh, who is heading out west as well. Marsh travels in style, lounging in coach while the rest of his team travels third class—Marsh even berates them for playing cards, saying it is [...] "low class" [...] and that Yale graduates should look more presentable. [...] At Fort McPherson, Nebraska, Marsh meets [...] "Buffalo" [...] Bill Cody, who serves as their guide, along with the Native American Indian tribe. Marsh discovers many new fossils, and promises to Chief Red Cloud that he will talk to the President of the United States about the situation of the Native Americans—they have been given spoiled food in exchange for their land. Back East, Knight has finished his reconstruction of Elasmosaurus. He and Knight return to the marl pits of New Jersey, but are forced away. Cope becomes furious and storms away when he learns Marsh has bought the digging rights and published a paper revealing his interpretation of Elasmosaurus flawed.|$|E
2500|$|The City of Toronto <b>is</b> <b>introducing</b> a 9% {{water rate}} {{increase}} for 2007, with similar increases expected {{for the foreseeable}} future. [...] Miller's administration argues that the money is needed to fix aging water and sewer pipes.|$|E
2500|$|Stephen Booth {{argues that}} the editing of the comma [...] "has {{no effect on the}} logic of the line".

2500|$|Different {{types of}} {{inheritance}} can attribute to this disease; autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, X-linked type, etc. The main function of rhodopsin is initiating the phototransduction cascade. The opsin proteins {{are made in}} the photoreceptor inner segments, then transported to the outer segment, and eventually phagocytized by the RPE cells. When mutations occur in the rhodopsin the directional protein movement is affected because the mutations can affect protein folding, stability, and intracellular trafficking. One approach <b>is</b> <b>introducing</b> AAV-delivered [...] ribozymes designed to target and destroy a mutant mRNA.|$|E
2500|$|It <b>is</b> <b>introducing</b> {{elements}} of many modern and historical languages. Compatibility with Perl 5 {{is not a}} goal, though a compatibility mode {{is part of the}} specification.

2500|$|Series D was {{the first}} to see all the episodes focus upon a single topic or theme, {{beginning}} with the series letter (i.e., Danger), and for each to be given an official title connected to the topic/theme; it also saw Fry modify his introduction of the panelists, by incorporating the theme/topic of the episode, with Davies often getting the [...] "demeaning" [...] introduction. This trend has continued with each subsequent series; episodes from previous series were retroactively given titles. A video podcast (featuring the best moments with some out-takes) was planned to accompany Series E, but this was instead turned into a set of [...] "Quickies" [...] featured on the QI homepage of the BBC's website. As this decision was not reached until after recording though, they are still referred to as [...] "vodcasts" [...] by whoever <b>is</b> <b>introducing</b> them (usually Fry but occasionally a panelist or even the audience).|$|E
