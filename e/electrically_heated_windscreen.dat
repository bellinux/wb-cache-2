40|$|It is not {{an unusual}} {{complaint}} that in patients with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis vulgaris or hand eczema, using warm water causes pain and/or itching of the injured skin. In using warm water, there are some patients with injured skin who do not complain of pain and/or itching and ordinary patients with skin injured as much as former who complain of pain and/or itching. This made us think {{that there must be}} a difference in the warm water used by these patients. Usually we get warm water from gas instantly heated water or from <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> stored water. In patients using warm water from gas instantly heated water the complaints were more frequent than in patients using warm water from <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> stored water. Residual chlorine in water is well known to be the main factor worsening skin disease. Therfore, residual chlorine levels in gas instantly <b>heated</b> water and <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> stored water were measured at same temperature (40 ℃). Levels of the former were 67. 5 ～ 77. 5 % and that of the latter were 12. 5 - 31. 7 % of tap water. Then this significant difference in the levels of residual chlorine was thought to be a cause for the difference of complaints between patients using warm water from gas instantly heated water and patients using warm water from <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> stored water...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the then German Federal Railways (Deutsche Bundesbahn or DB) and the German railway {{industry}} developed the V 160 series (with which this class shares {{the majority of}} its design features), a diesel locomotive for use on medium-duty passenger and freight trains on main and secondary lines. These locomotives had steam heating apparatus for passenger coaches, but could not power <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> stock. Therefore, with the increasing use in the future of <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> coaches, co-commitment with the increasing electrification of the system it was necessary to produce a variant with a method of electrical power generation.|$|R

25|$|The {{alternative}} is the Pirani gauge, which operates {{in a similar}} way, over approximately the same pressure range, but is only a 2-terminal device, sensing the change in resistance with temperature of a thin <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> wire, rather than using a thermocouple.|$|R
50|$|A flameless lighter {{is a safe}} {{alternative}} to traditional lighters. The flameless lighter uses an enclosed heating element which glows, so that the device does not produce an open flame.
