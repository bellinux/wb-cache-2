40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} {{study the effects of}} addition of purified tannins at low concentration into hay diet on in vitro gas emission and rumen fermentation. Treatments consisted of: P 0 (control hay), P 1 (hay + 0. 5 mg chestnut tannin/ml of incubation medium), P 2 (hay + 0. 5 mg/ml mimosa tannin), P 3 (hay + 0. 5 mg/ml quebracho tannin) and P 4 (hay + 0. 5 mg/ml sumach tannin). Variables measured were gas production kinetics, organic matter digestibility (OMD), methane production, expressed as percent methane in total gas and methane production per unit organic matter digested, and volatile fatty acid (VFA) production. The results showed that in most cases tannin addition at 0. 5 mg/ml decreased significantly (P < 0. 05) total and rate of gas production, OMD, total VFA and iso-VFA. Tannin addition also decreased methane production (P < 0. 05). <b>Hydrolysable</b> <b>tannins</b> seemed to have better methane reduction effect than condensed tannins. The best tannin to decrease methane was chestnut <b>tannin,</b> which contained <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannins.</b> Present research should be shifted from evaluating only the effect of condensed tannins in reducing methane emission towards some potential <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannins</b> since the nature and the toxicity of <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannins</b> are quite diverse...|$|R

5000|$|Chestnut wood is {{a useful}} source of natural tannin and was used for tanning leather before the {{introduction}} of synthetic tannins. On a 10% moisture basis, the bark contains 6.8% tannin and the wood 13.4%. The bark imparts a dark colour to the tannin, and has a higher sugar content, which increases the percentage of soluble non-tans, or impurities, in the extract; {{so it was not}} employed in this use. Chestnut tannin is obtained by hot-water extraction of chipped wood. It is an ellagic tannin and its main constituents are identified by castalagin (14.2%) and vescalagin (16.2%).It has a naturally low pH value, relatively low salts content, and high acids content. This determines its astringency and its capability to fix raw hides. These properties make chestnut extract especially suitable for the tanning of heavy hides and to produce leather soles for high-quality shoes in particular. It is possible to obtain a leather with high yield in weight, which is compact, firm, flexible, and waterproof. Chestnut-tanned leathers are elastic, lightfast, resistant to traction and abrasion, and have warm colour.Chestnut tannin is one of the pyrogallol class of tannins (also known as <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannin).</b> As it tends to give a brownish tone to the leather, it is most often used in combination with quebracho, mimosa, tara, myrabolans, and valonia. [...] The wood seems to reach its highest tannin content after the trees reach 30 years old. The southern European chestnut wood usually contains at least 10 to 13% more tannin than chestnut trees in northern climates.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the in vitro {{inhibitory}} effects on the salivary and pancreatic α-amylases and the in vivo hypoglycemic actions of the <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannin</b> from Chinese natural gall and the condensed tannin from Acacia mearnsii. The human salivary α-amylase was more strongly inhibited by the hydrolysable than by the condensed tannin, with the concentrations for 50 % inhibition (IC 50) being 47. 0 and 285. 4 [*]μM, respectively. The inhibitory capacities of both tannins on the pancreatic α-amylase were also different, with IC 50 values being 141. 1 [*]μM for the <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannin</b> and 248. 1 [*]μM for the condensed tannin. The kinetics of the inhibition presented complex patterns in that for both inhibitors more than one molecule can bind simultaneously to either the free enzyme of the substrate-complexed enzyme (parabolic mixed inhibition). Both tannins were able to inhibit the intestinal starch absorption. Inhibition by the <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannin</b> was concentration-dependent, with 53 % inhibition at the dose of 58. 8 [*]μmol/kg and 88 % inhibition at the dose of 294 [*]μmol/kg. For the condensed tannin, inhibition was not substantially different for doses between 124. 4 [*]μmol/kg (49 %) and 620 [*]μmol/kg (57 %). It can be concluded that both tannins, but especially the hydrolysable one, could be useful in controlling the postprandial glycemic levels in diabetes...|$|E

40|$|Bush tea, Athrixia phyliciodes L. (Asteraceae family) is {{a popular}} plant in South Africa used {{predominantly}} as an herbal tea and for medicinal purposes, including the cleansing or purifying blood and the treating of boils (carbuncles) and coughs. In some parts of South Africa, bush tea is used as an aphrodisiac. In this study, bush tea was grown under varying nitrogen (N) levels in four experiments that collectively covered a whole year to determine the seasonal nutrient requirements for improvement of quality. The treatments consisted of 0, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 kg·ha- 1 N in a randomized complete block design, replicated four times (autumn, winter, spring, summer) under 50 % shade nets. The tannins were extracted with acetone, mixed with reagent (butanol-HCL for condensed tannins and potassium iodate for <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannins),</b> and levels measured spectrophotometrically. The {{results of this study}} demonstrated that both condensed and <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannins</b> increased quadratically in response to N nutrition reaching a maximum at 300 kg·ha- 1 N. Maximum content of condensed tannins was 4. 5 % which was achieved when growing the plants in during autumn and winter, whereas maximum content of <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannins</b> was 0. 1 %, achieved during spring and summer. Therefore, for improved condensed tannin content in bush tea leaves growing during the autumn (4. 5 %) or winter (3. 7 %) and <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannins</b> during spring and summer (0. 1 %), 300 kg·ha- 1 N is recommended...|$|R
30|$|The {{extracts}} of Quercus crispula {{infected by}} the ambrosia fungus, Raffaelea quercivora, were investigated. Phenol and tannin analyses indicated that normal sapwood (NS) contained {{a considerable amount}} of <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannins,</b> while infected colored sapwood (IS) contained less <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannins</b> and more phenols than NS. In treating pentagalloyl glucose (PGG), which is a model compound of <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannins,</b> with a culture medium of R. quercivora, PGG was rapidly hydrolyzed to produce gallic acid. The resulting gallic acid decreased in concentration over the subsequent cultivation period eventually disappeared. Measuring tannase and laccase activities of the culture medium of R. quercivora, tannase activity increased gradually from the beginning, while laccase activity increased rapidly at 5 days of incubation and disappeared at 8 days. An oxidative product from gallic acid treated with laccase was isolated by preparative high performance liquid chromatography, and was identified as purprogallincarboxylic acid (PGCA) by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electron-impact mass spectrometry. PGCA was present in a 70 % aqueous acetone extract of IS, and showed slight growth inhibition against R. quercivora.|$|R

40|$|For Review. Confidential The {{relative}} {{abilities of}} two enological tannins {{to interact with}} a single gelatin were compared with their relative abilities to elicit astringency. A trained sensory panel assessed astringency whereas the interaction between tannins and gelatin was estimated by observing the ability of tannins both to interfere with gelatin diffusion on a cellulose membrane and to form tanningelatin precipitates. HPLC chromatography and spectroscopic analysis showed {{that one of the}} tannins was <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannin</b> while the other one was a proanthocyanidin. The majority of the sensory panelists recognized the <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannin</b> as far more astringent than the proanthocyanidin. Finally we showed that the more astringent tannin interfered markedly with gelatin diffusion on the cellulose membrane but it failed to produce tannin-gelatin precipitation whereas the proanthocyanidin tannin both interfered with gelatin diffusion and was a powerful gelatin-precipitant. Thus, this study supports the hypothesis that astringency correlates better with gelatin-tannin interaction than gelatin-tannin precipitation...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether a <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannin</b> extract of sweet chestnut wood (Globatan (R)) has an inhibitory effect on Salmonella Typhimurium survival both in vitro and in vivo in pigs. In a first experiment, the minimal inhibitory concentration of Globatan (R) on 57 Salmonella Typhimurium isolates was determined. For all isolates, an MIC of 160 - 320 mu g/ml was found. The second in vitro study revealed that Salmonella growth was strongly reduced using Globatan (R) concentrations of 25 - 50 mu g/ml and nearly completely inhibited at a concentration of 100 mu g/ml Globatan (R). In an in vivo trial, two groups of six piglets, each group receiving feed with or without the addition of Globatan (R) (3 g/kg), were orally inoculated with 107 colony forming units of a Salmonella Typhimurium strain. Globatan (R) had no effect on faecal excretion of Salmonella, and no differences in colonization of the intestines and internal organs were demonstrated in pigs euthanized at 4 days post-inoculation. In conclusion, the <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannin</b> extract used in this study showed strong action against Salmonella Typhimurium in vitro but not in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of the dietary supplementation of chestnut <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannin</b> on the feed digestibility and nutritive value, mortality and growth performance, fatty acid profile and TBARS of cooked Longissimus dorsi (LD) meat. From the age of 18 days the rabbits were fed pellets supplemented with coccidiostat (CC) or with tannin (400 g/ 100 kg: T 400). At weaning (35 d of age) within both groups 5 dietary sub-groups were formed: medicated-free (C 0), containing coccidiostatic (CC), or supplemented with increasing levels of chestnut tannin (T 200, T 400 and T 600). Rabbits fed the 5 diets ad libitum until slaughter at 11 weeks of age. The coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) of nutrients was not affected by the tannin inclusion, substantially, with exception of CTTAD of hemicelluloses, that was lower in T 400 and T 600 compared to C 0 and T 200 (P< 0. 001), the CTTAD of Ca, lower in T 400 vs C 0 and CC (P< 0. 05) and CTTAD of DP-to-DE ratio, lowest in CC and T 600 (P< 0. 001). Dietary tannin significantly modified the CTTAD of FA classes. At weaning, the live weight of CC rabbits was significantly higher than that of the T 400 rabbits (974 vs 940 g, P< 0. 05). The other variables related to growth performance, health status and carcass traits were not affected by the tannin supplementation. The T 400 diet fed before weaning seemed to be more effective than the 3 tannin levels administered during fattening period on FA profile change in the LD muscle. T 400 diet fed before weaning increased SFA and MUFA (P< 0. 01) and decreased PUFA (P< 0. 05), decreasing the n- 6 /n- 3 ratio (P< 0. 01), however. When tannin-supplemented diets were fed during fattening, only T 600 diet showed significantly higher (P< 0. 05) SFA and MUFA contents compared to CC diet. In conclusion, the dietary inclusion of chestnut <b>hydrolysable</b> <b>tannin</b> doesn’t provides improvements in health status, diet nutritive value, growth performance and carcass traits.
