40|$|Disability {{affects the}} lives of {{hundreds}} of millions across the world. People with disabilities often experience discrimination and unequal treatment. Sometimes the mere categorization of people into groups, that is, ‘healthy’ vs. ‘disabled’, is enough to trigger discriminatory behaviour against people with disabilities. Previous studies show that in <b>general</b> <b>disabilities</b> depress political participation. However, the effect of disability-based discrimination on participation has received little scholarly attention. We study how perceptions of discrimination affect three forms of political participation: voting; contacting politicians; and participating in demonstrations. Results show that disability decreases voting, especially when associated with perceptions of discrimination. The analysis points {{in the opposite direction}} when the other two forms of political participation are analysed. People with disabilities are more likely to partake in demonstrations and contact politicians than non-disabled. Thus, disability-based discrimination is not always a hindrance to participation. It sometimes further motivates people with disabilities to participate...|$|R

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{has high}} prevalence in the ageing population {{and is often}} accompanied by other comorbidities, such as Alzheimer’s disease, and <b>general</b> <b>disabilities,</b> such as poor eyesight.

Due to the increasing number of older adults, we wanted to ensure the app was suitable for that demographic. Based on a number of supervised tests, we show that the app, which was developed with the help of workshops and feedback from tech-savvy patients and clinicians, is difficult to use by elderly users. We demonstrate that with a small number of changes it is possible to raise the usability of the app in a number of categories. We summarise the lessons learned in the discussion. Our findings demonstrate that special care needs to be taken when developing mHealth apps for the elderly population...|$|R

50|$|Since the {{abolition}} of the general right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords, and the consequent removal of the <b>general</b> <b>disability</b> of such peers to sit in or vote for the House of Commons, it is no longer necessary for hereditary peers to disclaim their peerages for this purpose. In 2001, John Sinclair, 3rd Viscount Thurso became the first British hereditary peer to be elected to the Commons and take his seat. Later that year, Douglas Hogg inherited the peerage his father (Quintin Hogg) had disclaimed, but did not have to disclaim it himself to continue sitting in the House of Commons. In 2004, Michael Ancram became Marquess of Lothian on the death of his father, and was also able to continue sitting as an MP. On their retirements from the House of Commons, Ancram and Hogg entered the House of Lords as life peers, while Thurso was elected as an excepted hereditary peer after losing reelection as an MP. Since the chief purpose for the Act ended in 1999, only one disclaimer has occurred — Christopher Silkin disclaimed the title 3rd Baron Silkin in 2002.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{usefulness}} of hand function measurements {{in a study of}} treatment effects of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockers and to define the relationship between different hand function tests and also relate hand function to <b>general</b> <b>disability</b> and disease activity. Methods: The study group consisted of 49 patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were followed for 1 year while on TNF inhibitors. Evaluation of hand function included Signals of Functional Impairment (SOFI), grip and pinch grip force, and the Grip Ability Test (GAT). <b>General</b> <b>disability</b> was assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and disease activity by the 28 -joint Disease Activity Score (DAS 28). The standardized mean response (SMR) method was used to evaluate sensitivity to change for all hand tests using DAS 28 and HAQ as external indicators of change. Results: HAQ, DAS 28, grip and pinch grip force, and GAT showed a highly significant improvement over time (p< 0. 001). The improvement in SOFI was also significant (p< 0. 01). The correlations between the different hand tests varied between 0. 45 and 0. 72. All hand function tests were significantly related to HAQ but showed only weak correlations to DAS 28. SOFI, grip force, and pinch grip force showed large sensitivity for improvement in DAS 28 and HAQ (SMR = 0. 8 - 0. 9). GAT showed modest sensitivity (SMR = 0. 6 - 0. 7). Conclusions: Patients with advanced RA attained considerable improvement in hand function that was only partly reflected by measures of <b>general</b> <b>disability</b> and disease activity. Focused assessment of hand function is therefore important for optimal evaluation of treatment response...|$|E
