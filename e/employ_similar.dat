5|$|In February 2013 Sebastian Ortega and {{the cast}} agreed to produce another season of Graduados {{after a year}} off, and Telefe had begun {{negotiations}} to bring the series back. The project became a new telenovela, Viudas e hijos del Rock and Roll, which would <b>employ</b> <b>similar</b> themes {{and most of the}} cast. Nancy Dupláa left the project, with Paola Barrientos replacing her as the female lead.|$|E
5|$|The French {{would use}} the lessons learned at Muong Khoua {{and those of the}} 1952 Battle of Na San in their defence plans at Điện Biên Phủ, while the Viet Minh in turn would <b>employ</b> <b>similar</b> tactics of encirclement and {{strangulation}} there. The importance of an air bridge to maintain supply lines, strong artillery support to stave off human-wave Viet Minh attacks, and the need for isolated emplacements to mutually support each other, were also important tactics taken on board by the French from both conflicts. The disappearance of local civiliain populations previously friendly towards the French, which served as a precursor to Viet Minh attack, was also remembered by the Điện Biên Phủ troops. For the Viet Minh, their abilities to isolated and smother individual strongpoints while maintaining hidden artillery and support weapon emplacements {{out of the reach of}} French airstrikes and artillery were honed at both battles, as were their practicies of using human-wave attacks.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, the Court {{struck down}} {{part of the}} federal Defense of Marriage Act, in United States v. Windsor. No state statute was in question, and {{therefore}} the Equal Protection Clause did not apply. The Court did <b>employ</b> <b>similar</b> principles, however, in combination with federalism principles. The Court did not purport to use any level of scrutiny more demanding than rational basis review, according to law professor Erwin Chemerinsky. The four dissenting justices argued that the authors of the statute were rational.|$|E

25|$|Thrash metal is {{directly}} responsible {{for the development of}} underground metal genres, such as death metal and black metal. In addition to this, metalcore, grindcore and deathcore <b>employ</b> <b>similar</b> riffs in their composition, the former with more focus on melody rather than chromaticism. The blending of punk ethos and metal's brutal nature led to even more extreme, underground styles after thrash metal began gaining mild commercial success in the late 1980s. With gorier subject matter, heavier downtuning of guitars, more consistent use of blast beat drumming, and darker, atonal death growls, death metal was established in the mid-1980s.|$|E
25|$|The {{nineteen}} organ praeludia (or preludes) {{form the}} core of Buxtehude's work and are ultimately considered his most important contributions to the music literature of the seventeenth century. They are sectional compositions that alternate between free improvisation and strict counterpoint. They are usually either fugues or pieces written in fugal manner; all make heavy use of pedal and are idiomatic to the organ. These preludes, together with pieces by Nicolaus Bruhns, represent the highest point {{in the evolution of}} the north German organ prelude, and the so-called stylus phantasticus. They were undoubtedly among the strongest influences of J.S. Bach, whose organ preludes, toccatas and fugues frequently <b>employ</b> <b>similar</b> techniques.|$|E
500|$|In Guatemala, Bilheimer {{facilitated}} {{the arrest of}} trafficker Ortiz by renting a car {{for the police to}} use, in order to film the arrest as part of Not My Life. Bilheimer said that, during the making of the film, he and his crew were surprised to discover that traffickers <b>employ</b> <b>similar</b> methods of intimidation across the globe, [...] "almost as if there were... unwritten bylaws and tactics... The lies are the same." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{decades after}} Adams' death, {{his role in}} codifying baseball's early rules was largely unremembered. Thorn {{included}} Adams {{among a group of}} [...] "powerfully influential figures" [...] from the period—also including Louis F. Wadsworth and Wheaton—who he writes [...] "went unrecognized in their lifetimes and became mysteries to future generations." [...] Alexander Cartwright was more widely recognized as a pioneering figure for the sport. The Baseball Hall of Fame has claimed that Cartwright was the inventor of 90-foot (27m) baselines and the nine-inning game. However, by the time conventions led by Adams had enacted those rules in the late 1850s, Cartwright had traveled to California and was no longer a member of the Knickerbockers. Adams is said to have avoided [...] "campaigning for credit" [...] for rules changes after he left the Knickerbockers; researcher Gary O'Maxfield said of him that he [...] "didn't like to brag." [...] Several of the rules approved at the conventions survived to modern baseball, including the 90-foot (27m) baseline distance. The 45-foot (14m) distance from home plate to the pitching mound, however, did not last through the 19th century; it was pushed back [...] in 1880. The shortstop position, which for Adams was located between the infielders and outfielders, was later played in the infield, between second and third base. Dickey Pearce was the first player to field in that area, and his ability to prevent base hits in the formerly unoccupied territory convinced other teams to <b>employ</b> <b>similar</b> tactics.|$|E
2500|$|AAVE is {{also used}} by non-black artists in genres other than hip-hop, if less frequently. For instance, in [...] "Tonight, Tonight", Hot Chelle Rae uses the term dime to mean [...] "an {{attractive}} woman". Jewel's [...] "Sometimes It Be That Way" [...] employs habitual BE in the title to indicate habitual aspect. If they do not <b>employ</b> <b>similar</b> features of AAVE in their speech, then {{it can be argued}} that they are modeling their musical performance to evoke aspects of particular musical genres such as R & B or the blues (as British pop musicians of the 1960s and beyond did to evoke rock, pop, and the blues).|$|E
2500|$|Mannitol {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} energy and carbon storage molecules in nature, produced by a plethora of organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, algae, lichens, and many plants. Fermentation by microorganisms is an alternative to the traditional industrial synthesis. A fructose to mannitol metabolic pathway, known as the mannitol cycle in fungi, has been discovered in a type of red algae (Caloglossa leprieurii), and it is highly possible that other microorganisms <b>employ</b> <b>similar</b> such pathways. A class of lactic acid bacteria, labeled heterofermentive because of their multiple fermentation pathways, convert either three fructose molecules or two fructose and one glucose molecule into two mannitol molecules, and one molecule each of lactic acid, acetic acid, and carbon dioxide. Feedstock syrups containing medium to large concentrations of fructose (for example, cashew apple juice, containing 55% fructose: 45% glucose) can produce yields [...] mannitol per liter of feedstock. Further research is being conducted, studying ways to engineer even more efficient mannitol pathways in lactic acid bacteria, as well as the use of other microorganisms such as yeast and E. coli in mannitol production. When food-grade strains of any of the aforementioned microorganisms are used, the mannitol and the organism itself are directly applicable to food products, avoiding the need for careful separation of microorganism and mannitol crystals. Although this is a promising method, steps are needed to scale it up to industrially needed quantities.|$|E
