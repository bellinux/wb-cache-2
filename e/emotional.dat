5|$|Although {{the numbers}} of dogs killed each year are {{relatively}} low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs. In many cultures, there are strong social and <b>emotional</b> bonds between humans and their dogs {{that can be seen}} as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong <b>emotional</b> responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E
5|$|Belief in {{prenatal}} fetal awareness, mental {{communication between}} mother and unborn child, and <b>emotional</b> attachment of child to mother as a prenatal phenomenon, are concepts that connect easily to the unfounded assumption that all adopted children suffer <b>emotional</b> disorders. These beliefs are also congruent with CAM psychotherapies such as attachment therapy (not based on attachment theory), which purport to bring about age regression and to recapitulate early development to produce a better outcome.|$|E

25|$|Cross-sectional {{research}} of cancer samples reveals some positive, negative and mixed links with <b>emotional</b> approach coping. Higher <b>emotional</b> processing and <b>emotional</b> expression in female cancer survivors {{was associated with}} higher positive emotions and lower negative emotions. In male cancer survivors, higher <b>emotional</b> processing {{has been linked to}} higher positive emotions and higher <b>emotional</b> expression has been linked with lower negative emotions and fewer intrusive thoughts. However, the links between <b>emotional</b> approach coping and psychological adjustment are not all positive some are negative or mixed. In one study of women who had received an abnormal result on an ovarian cancer screen, higher <b>emotional</b> processing was associated with higher intrusive thoughts and neither <b>emotional</b> processing nor <b>emotional</b> expression were associated with cancer-related post-traumatic growth.|$|E

25|$|<b>Emotional</b> {{approach}} coping is {{a psychological}} construct {{that involves the}} use of <b>emotional</b> processing and <b>emotional</b> expression in response to a stressful situation.

25|$|The {{brain regions}} {{identified}} in the above studies are associated with empathy, compassion, <b>emotional</b> regulation, and cognitive functioning. These findings suggest that narcissistic personality disorder is related to a compromised capacity for <b>emotional</b> empathy and <b>emotional</b> regulation.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between trait <b>emotional</b> intelligence and ability <b>emotional</b> intelligence {{was introduced in}} 2000.|$|E
25|$|Individual differences, such as {{skill at}} {{engaging}} active coping techniques and comfort with expressing emotions, may modify {{the tendency to}} successfully employ <b>emotional</b> approach coping. Individuals high in perceived <b>emotional</b> intelligence may also {{be more likely to}} use <b>emotional</b> approach coping skillfully. Holding unrealistic perceptions of control may make the use of coping through <b>emotional</b> approach less likely because expressing and processing emotions could lead to evaluations that result in acknowledgement of illusions of control. Personality attributes, such as hope, can also moderate the effectiveness of <b>emotional</b> approach coping. Women with breast cancer who were high in hope and reported coping with <b>emotional</b> expression, had fewer medical appointments for cancer-related complaints, enhanced physical health and decreased distress compared to women who did not cope using <b>emotional</b> expression.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} to suggest that the utility of <b>emotional</b> approach coping varies by gender. In a longitudinal study, <b>emotional</b> approach coping was found to predict increased life satisfaction and decreased depressive symptoms over time in women; however, in men, <b>emotional</b> approach coping predicted poorer adjustment over time. Some samples have also found that women report using <b>emotional</b> processing and expression more than men. However, research of infertile couples found no differences in the utility of <b>emotional</b> approach coping for men and women.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} further {{follow-up}} studies conducted {{using a different}} approach. In these follow-up studies the experimenters contacted certain individuals after foreseeable <b>emotional</b> experiences, such as {{the birth of a}} child, giving blood, or taking an exam. This way, the experimenters chose not only the <b>emotional</b> event to be recalled, but furthermore the types of <b>emotional</b> events they would be studying so that they could examine possible differences between types of <b>emotional</b> events. The findings of these studies supported those of the retrospective studies: 96–100% of <b>emotional</b> events were socially shared. Furthermore, no significant difference was found in the frequency of social sharing between different types of <b>emotional</b> events.|$|E
25|$|Among {{heterosexual}} couples {{coping with}} infertility, <b>emotional</b> approach coping predicted decreased depressive symptoms for both {{members of the}} couple after an unsuccessful insemination attempt. <b>Emotional</b> approach coping may also confer benefits for partners. Having a male partner high in <b>emotional</b> approach coping was protective against depressive symptoms for female partners low in <b>emotional</b> approach coping.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Emotional</b> Competency Inventory (ECI), {{which was}} created in 1999, and the <b>Emotional</b> and Social Competency Inventory (ESCI), a newer edition of the ECI was {{developed}} in 2007. The <b>Emotional</b> and Social Competency – University Edition (ESCI-U) is also available. These tools developed by Goleman and Boyatzis provide a behavioral measure of the <b>Emotional</b> and Social competencies.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>emotional</b> {{approach}} coping may {{signal to}} the social environment that an individual {{is in need of}} support. The responsiveness of the social environment will determine the adaptiveness of <b>emotional</b> approach coping. <b>Emotional</b> expression that is met with empathetic concern may lead to better adjustment than <b>emotional</b> expression met by rejection. Some evidence from the research suggests this could be a potential mechanism. For women with breast cancer who perceive their social environment to be highly receptive, coping through <b>emotional</b> expression predicts improved quality of life.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to point out that the secondary social sharing is not limited to negative <b>emotional</b> episodes, but instead can occur after positive <b>emotional</b> episodes as well. In one study, 83% of the participants reported some degree of secondary social sharing in response to both positive and negative <b>emotional</b> situation, with no differences found between these two valences. However, there were some qualitative differences between secondary sharing for each: for positive <b>emotional</b> episodes, secondary social sharing was initiated faster and with a higher number of repetitions and targets than for negatives <b>emotional</b> episodes.|$|E
25|$|Verbal {{abuse is}} a pattern of {{behaviour}} that can seriously interfere with one's positive <b>emotional</b> development {{and can lead to}} significant detriment to one's self-esteem, <b>emotional</b> well-being, and physical state. It has been further described as an ongoing <b>emotional</b> environment organised by the abuser for the purposes of control.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} <b>emotional</b> memory and sleep {{can be applied}} to real-life {{situations}} e.g. by developing more effective learning strategies. One could integrate the memorization of information that possesses high <b>emotional</b> significance (highly salient) with information that holds little <b>emotional</b> significance (low salience), prior to a period of sleep.|$|E
25|$|Cross-sectional studies {{illustrate}} {{the link between}} <b>emotional</b> approach coping and positive psychological adjustment, under certain conditions in student and community samples. In a cross-sectional study of undergraduate women, women who scored more highly on <b>emotional</b> approach coping reported more positive and less negative valenced repetitive thoughts. In a community sample of African-American adults, <b>emotional</b> approach coping has also {{been found to be}} negatively associated with anger, trait anxiety and depressive symptoms. In addition, women who reported higher dispositional <b>emotional</b> processing also reported fewer depressive and anxious symptoms and greater life satisfaction; while for men, higher dispositional <b>emotional</b> expression was linked to greater life satisfaction.|$|E
25|$|According to Bruce Lee, {{martial arts}} {{also have the}} nature of an art, since there is <b>emotional</b> {{communication}} and complete <b>emotional</b> expression.|$|E
25|$|There {{is mixed}} {{evidence}} for the utility of <b>emotional</b> approach coping in samples of women with breast cancer. In a longitudinal study of women with breast cancer, for women who perceived their social environments to be receptive, <b>emotional</b> expression predicted improved quality of life. Coping through <b>emotional</b> expression among women with breast cancer has also been found to predict an increase in post-traumatic growth. However, other studies have not found the same link between <b>emotional</b> expression and post-traumatic growth.|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, {{sentiment}} analysis aims {{to determine the}} attitude of a speaker, writer, or other subject with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity or <b>emotional</b> reaction to a document, interaction, or event. The attitude may be a judgment or evaluation (see appraisal theory), affective state (that is to say, the <b>emotional</b> state of the author or speaker), or the intended <b>emotional</b> communication (that is to say, the <b>emotional</b> effect intended by the author or interlocutor).|$|E
25|$|<b>Emotional</b> target cues {{have been}} shown to {{eliminate}} age differences in prospective memory. For older participants, <b>emotional</b> prospective memory cues were better remembered than neutral cues. Whether the cues are positive or negative, strong <b>emotional</b> attachment makes the cue more self-relevant and easier to remember. For example, an aversive picture of a snake biting a person or a positive picture of a dog licking its owner are easier to remember because they evoke <b>emotional</b> responses, as opposed to a neutral picture of an animal that does not evoke an <b>emotional</b> response. It is speculated that the amygdala and hippocampus {{may play a role in}} this emotionally enhanced memory effect.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} to suggest associations between <b>emotional</b> approach coping and psychological well-being. In a study of individuals who met DSM-IV criteria for anxiety disorder and healthy controls, levels of <b>emotional</b> approach coping were lower in those individuals who met the criteria than in controls. Another study examined veterans and found that higher levels <b>emotional</b> expression (but not <b>emotional</b> processing) were associated with lower depressive symptoms and decreased post-traumatic stress disorder, even when statistically controlling for age, gender, and race.|$|E
25|$|Phenomena such as <b>emotional</b> {{lateralization}} {{may help}} describe how emotions arise, persist, and alter our behavior. Understanding <b>emotional</b> lateralization will help scientists understand emotion in general. <b>Emotional</b> lateralization may {{also play a}} role in psychological disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. Future treatment of psychological disorders may have more targeted neurological treatments rather than ingested drugs.|$|E
25|$|Kensinger argues {{there are}} two {{trade-off}}s: central/peripheral trade-off of details and a specific/general trade-off. <b>Emotional</b> memories may include increased <b>emotional</b> details often with the trade-off of excluding background information. Research has shown that this trade-off effect cannot be explained exclusively by overt attention (measured by eye-tracking directed to <b>emotional</b> items during encoding) (Steinmetz & Kensinger, 2013).|$|E
25|$|Knowing how to {{suppress}} and manage one's own feelings {{is known as}} <b>emotional</b> intelligence, {{the ability to control}} one's emotions {{and to be able to}} do this at a high level guarantees one's own ability to serve those in need. <b>Emotional</b> intelligence is performed while performing <b>emotional</b> labor, and without one the other can not be there.|$|E
