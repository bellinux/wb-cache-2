5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> women have been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression {{is responsive to}} alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown that}} the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against <b>depression.</b> <b>In</b> one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible <b>depression.</b> <b>In</b> the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E

5|$|The first {{official}} storm {{of the season}} was Cyclonic Storm Hibaru, which formed southeast of Sri Lanka in January. After nearly five months of inactivity, two depressions formed {{toward the end of}} June on opposite sides of India. The <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> the Arabian Sea was one of only two in that body of water during the year, the other of which formed in September and killed 13people. The other was a depression that formed over land and killed 26people in Madhya Pradesh, followed by another <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> July that killed one person. A series of deadly storms affected southeastern India beginning in September; a depression killed six people in Madhya Pradesh, Cyclonic Storm Pyarr killed 80people, an unclassified tropical storm killed 16people in nearby Bangladesh, and a deep <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> October killed 100people in Andhra Pradesh. December was active, with cyclonic storms Baaz and Fanoos hitting southern India, resulting in 11fatalities, and a deep depression remaining over waters {{in the middle of the}} month.|$|E

5|$|The {{shift to}} {{outsourcing}} raises issues about data integrity, regulatory oversight, language difficulties, {{the meaning of}} informed consent among a much poorer population, the standards of clinical care, {{the extent to which}} corruption may be regarded as routine in certain countries, and the ethical problem of raising a population's expectations for drugs that most of that population cannot afford. It also {{raises the question of whether}} the results of clinical trials using one population can invariably be applied elsewhere. There are both social and physical differences: Goldacre asks whether patients diagnosed with <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> China are really the same as patients diagnosed with <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> California, and notes that people of Asian descent metabolize drugs differently from Westerners.|$|E

40|$|<b>Depressions</b> <b>in</b> landscapes {{function}} as buffers {{for water and}} sediment. A landscape with depressions has less runoff, less erosion and more sedimentation than a landscape without <b>depressions.</b> Sinks <b>in</b> digital elevation models (DEMs) can be existing features that correctly represent <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> actual landscapes or spurious features that result from errors in DEM creation. In many erosion, landscape and hydrological models, all sinks are considered spurious features and, as a result, these models do not deal with sinks that do represent real depressions. Consequently, erosion is overestimated and sedimentation is underestimated. Dynamic geomorphological models that simulate soil redistribution in modelled landscapes in multiple timesteps have this problem in every timestep. A method that allows these models to deal with <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> a realistic way is needed. This paper presents an algorithm that allows models in general, and dynamic geomorphological model LAPSUS in particular, to deal with sinks in a DEM and, thus, with <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> a landscape. An application is presented where LAPSUS runs with the new algorithm are compared to the conventional runs. Results indicate that the new algorithm can realistically model the sediment buffer function of depressions. The inclusion of the new depression algorithm allows modelling landscape processes that can result <b>in</b> <b>depressions,</b> like landsliding, glacial processes and tectonics. It is also demonstrated that static models, running only once with a DEM without sinks, display effects from the filling of the sinks before running...|$|R

The depression brought widespread rains to southern Maharashtra and Karnataka states, with 40mm (1.5in) of rain recorded in Karwar. Scattered heavy rain was also reported in the Laccadives.|$|E

The declaration allowed low-interest loans to become available for repairs to small businesses and granted money to city and county governments to rebuild damaged buildings, bridges, and roads. Funds were also given to aid restoration of flooded farmland and damaged crops.|$|E
5|$|Although the 1920s saw {{a slight}} growth in traffic, the network's {{expansion}} {{slowed to a}} halt. Private motoring had arrived {{to put an end}} to its monopoly. The rising power of buses and trolleybuses, the Great <b>Depression</b> <b>in</b> France, and above all the Second World War that ravaged Rouen and Normandy, condemned the tramway to death. The last trams stopped running in 1953, after seventy-six years of service. However, in 1994, a new Rouen tramway came to the Norman capital.|$|E
40|$|Shock and {{arterial}} insufficiency {{have been}} observed {{to be associated with}} increased levels of sepsis and mortality. As the vast majority of small recirculating lymphocytes reach lymph nodes in arterial blood, the haemodynamic components of lymph node function would appear to be of importance. Lymphocyte traffic in sheep, as mirrored by the output of lymphocytes into the efferent lymph of popliteal lymph nodes, obtained by chronic cannulation of efferent lymphatics, was found to be sharply depressed both by intravenous nitroprusside infusion induced systemic arterial hypotension and by acute femoral arterial ligation {{on the side of the}} study node. In the nitroprusside infusion induced arterial hypotension studies, the <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> lymphocyte traffic were closely related to the <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> systemic arterial blood pressure. Excellent colateral circulation and compensatory physiological mechanisms in the sheep limited the duration of these <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> lymphocyte traffic...|$|R

40|$|The {{photosynthetic}} {{performances of}} individual leaves of a wheat (Triticum aestivum cv Bezostaya) crop were assessed daily and throughout individual days {{during the winter}} when temperature and light levels were fluctuating. Measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence induction and the maximum quantum yield of O 2 evolution were made on individual leaves. <b>Depressions</b> <b>in</b> the ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence (Fv/Fm) were correlated with low temperatures and high light levels throughout the winter and {{during the course of}} individual days. <b>Depressions</b> <b>in</b> Fv/Fm observed in the field during the day were not accompanied by any significant change in the ability of photosystem II complexes to bind 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1 -dimethyl urea, indicating that the <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> Fv/Fm were not attributable to photodamage to the D 1 protein of the photosystem II reaction center. Decreases in Fv/Fm were associated with increases in the rate of dissipation of excitation energy by radiationless decay processes and decreases in the quantum efficiency of CO 2 assimilation, indicative of a rapidly reversible light-induced “downregulation” of photosynthesis. No major changes were observed in the maximum quantum efficiency of O 2 evolution of leaves throughout periods of fluctuating temperature and light, because light-induced <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> photosynthetic efficiency recovered within the time required to make these measurements...|$|R
