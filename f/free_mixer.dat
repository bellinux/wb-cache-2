5000|$|... 1.6.0: In October 2010 PreSonus {{released}} version 1.6.0. This released included: <b>Free</b> routing in <b>mixer</b> with infinite nested buses, Mackie HUI support, VST 3.1 support (Knob mode), Chinese language, Transmit {{option for}} mapped controllers in Control Link, new resizing modifiers for note data, and REX2 file support for 64-bit Windows.|$|R

The Art Market is held on September 23 and is a {{non-profit}} art and craft fair designed to support the regional arts community by providing artists a venue for sale of work, self-promotion and networking.|$|R
40|$|An active retrodirective {{antenna array}} which has central phasing from a {{reference}} antenna element through a "tree" structured network of transmission lines utilizes {{a number of}} phase conjugate circuits (PCCs) at each node and a phase reference regeneration circuit (PRR) at each node except the initial node. Each node virtually coincides with {{an element of the}} array. A PCC generates the exact conjugate phase of an incident signal using a phase locked loop which combines the phases in an up converter, divides the sum by 2 and mixes the result with the phase in a down converter for phase detection. The PRR extracts the phase from the conjugate phase. Both the PCC and the PRR are not only exact but also <b>free</b> from <b>mixer</b> degeneracy...|$|R
50|$|Bordering on {{activism}} with an existentialist tone, Van Hove's {{early work}} {{is based on}} the artist's nomadic willing to simultaneously address local and global issues. It encompasses many media ranging from installation to performance, video, photography, sculpture and writing. At times insubstantial and subversive, Van Hove's conceptually poetic interventions often ponder and cross-refer to sociological, political and ecological issues as shown with Japanese Constitution Worm Autodafé, <b>Free</b> Trade Concrete <b>Mixer</b> Kaleidoscope, or Shark Fin Piñata, which relates to the illegal Taiwanese shark finning in Costa Rica (1998 - 2006), portrayed in Rob Stewart's documentary Sharkwater. Made at the end of 2007, Dan Liever the Lucht In is a body of works responding to the 2007-2011 Belgian political crisis which was first shown in situ at the Belgian embassy in Tokyo before the building was destroyed for reconstruction.|$|R
40|$|The {{reversely}} modulated optical {{single sideband}} scheme (IM-OSSB) {{based on a}} parallel Mach-Zehnder modulator (P-MZM) is proposed. In this P-MZM, one sub-MZM is employed for data modulation {{and the other is}} used for optical millimeter wave (mm-wave) generation. Due to the individual modulation, this scheme is data-format-transparent and can be used to generate a high performance optical mm-wave signal at the optimized direct current (dc) bias. There is electrical <b>mixer</b> <b>free</b> at the transmitter and thus the bandwidth limitation, nonlinearity and conversion loss from the electrical mixer are released in this scheme. Moreover, the modulation power efficiency of IM-OSSB can be improved by adjusting the dc bias in the modulator. Based on IM-OSSB, we demonstrate a 60 -GHz full duplex radio-over-fiber system. The experimental results show that the power penalty of 2. 9 -Gb/s on-off keying data carried by 58 -GHz mm-wave after transmission over 50 -km SMF- 28 is negligibl...|$|R
