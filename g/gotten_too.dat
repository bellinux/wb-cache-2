All that has changed under Ganguly, perhaps for the better." [...] He credits Ganguly for not being shy of taking on responsibility. [...] "He showed that he can be a leader of a team, which has greats like Sachin and Dravid in the side, without any problems. Under Ganguly's leadership, India started winning matches and tournaments, previously lacking from the team considerably." [...] Within a few years of his captaincy, Ganguly rewrote the rules of being a captain of a cricket team. Unlike some of his predecessors, Ganguly was considered impartial, non-parochial, and forever pushed his players to perform better. Off the field, his interactions with the media, his fans, and detractors were uncompromisingly honest and earned him the respect of cricket followers everywhere. However, along with this respect came the criticisms. Ganguly was condemned as a hot-tempered man who refused to listen to other's opinions and abided by his own rules and regulations. Matthew Engel, ICC sport critic, noted that this [...] "turning deaf" [...] to other's opinions would one day harm Ganguly and that it was sheer luck that he existed on the sporting world.|$|E

The cover chosen was the ninth one he painted for the project. Smith discussed the inspiration for the cover after he visited the band at their Maui recording studio. [...] "We talked about {{the world we live in}} and the issues that face our culture. Issues such as political propaganda, a sensationalist media, blind faith and micro-macrocosm were a few of the things we discussed. We liked the idea of a man with his back turned to the world, in a white blank room." [...] The concept was further discussed on his web page.
