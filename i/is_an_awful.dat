500|$|The {{polar group}} {{continued}} towards the Pole, passing Shackleton's Furthest South (88°23'S) on [...] Seven days later, about [...] from their goal, Amundsen's black flag was spotted {{and the party}} knew {{that they had been}} forestalled. They reached the Pole the next day, [...] 1912: [...] "The Pole. Yes, but under very different circumstances from those expected... Great God! This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> place and terrible enough for us to have laboured to it without the reward of priority. Well, it is something to have got here" [...] Scott still hoped to race Amundsen to the telegraph cablehead in Australia: [...] "Now for a desperate struggle to get the news through first. I wonder if we can do it." [...] However, on 18 January 1912 they discovered Amundsen's tent, some supplies, a letter to King HaakonVII of Norway (which Amundsen politely asked Scott to deliver) and a note stating that Amundsen had arrived there with four companions on [...] 1911.|$|E
500|$|The march south {{began on}} 1 November 1911, a caravan of mixed {{transport}} groups (motors, dogs, horses), with loaded sledges, travelling at different rates, all designed {{to support a}} final group of four men who would make a dash for the Pole. The southbound party steadily reduced in size as successive support teams turned back. Scott reminded the returning Surgeon-Lieutenant Atkinson of the order [...] "to take the two dog-teams south {{in the event of}} Meares having to return home, as seemed likely". By 4 January 1912, the last two four-man groups had reached 87°34′S. Scott announced his decision: five men (Scott, Edward Wilson, Henry Bowers, Lawrence Oates and Edgar Evans) would go forward, the other three (Teddy Evans, William Lashly and Tom Crean) would return. The chosen group marched on, reaching the Pole on 17 January 1912, only to find that Amundsen had preceded them by five weeks. Scott's anguish is indicated in his diary: [...] "The worst has happened"; [...] "All the day dreams must go"; [...] "Great God! This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> place".|$|E
500|$|Despite Mary Shelley's {{attempts}} to assist Gatteschi financially, {{he tried to}} blackmail her one year later in 1845using indiscreet letters she had written. After not hearing from Gatteschi for months, she received threatening letters, which claimed that she had promised him financial success and even possibly marriage. He claimed that her letters would demonstrate this. The contents of Mary Shelley's letters are unknown as they were later destroyed, but she must have felt some danger, for she took great pains to recover the letters and wrote agonised letters to her friends: [...] " [...] were written with an open heart – & contain details with regard to my past history, which it [...] destroy me for ever if they ever saw light." [...] Shelley turned to Alexander Knox for help. After obtaining help from the British government, he travelled to Paris and had the Paris police seize Gatteschi's correspondence. Implying that Gatteschi was {{a danger to the}} state, Knox and the Paris police called upon the cabinet noir system in order to retrieve the letters. On 11 October, Le National and Le Constitutionnel reported in outrage that Gatteschi's personal papers were seized because he was a suspected revolutionary. Mary wrote to Claire that [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> power this seizure", but she did not regret using it. After Knox retrieved her letters, he burned them. Shelley spent £250 of her own money to finance the operation. She was embarrassed by the entire incident.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2006, Tutu {{repeated}} {{these statements}} after a UN report was published {{which called for}} {{the closure of the}} camp. Tutu stated that the Guantanamo camp was a stain on the character of the United States, while the legislation in Britain which gave a 28-day detention period for terror suspects was [...] "excessive" [...] and [...] "untenable". Tutu claimed that arguments being made in Britain and the United States were similar to those the South African apartheid regime had used. [...] "It is disgraceful and one cannot find strong enough words to condemn what Britain and the United States and some of their allies have accepted," [...] said Tutu. Tutu also spoke against Tony Blair's failed attempt to hold terrorist suspects in Britain for up to 90 days without charge. [...] "Ninety days for a South African <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> déjà-vu because we had in South Africa in the bad old days a 90-day detention law," [...] he said. Under apartheid, as at Guantanamo, people were held for [...] "unconscionably long periods" [...] and then released, he said.|$|E
2500|$|Frank P. Ramsey {{visited him}} on 17 September 1923 {{to discuss the}} Tractatus; he had agreed to write a review of it for Mind. He {{reported}} in a letter home that Wittgenstein was living frugally in one tiny whitewashed room that only had space for a bed, washstand, a small table, and one small hard chair. Ramsey shared an evening meal with him of coarse bread, butter, and cocoa. Wittgenstein's school hours were eight to twelve or one, and he had afternoons free. After Ramsey returned to Cambridge a long campaign began among Wittgenstein's friends {{to persuade him to}} return to Cambridge and away from what they saw as a hostile environment for him. He was accepting no help even from his family. Ramsey wrote to John Maynard Keynes: [...] " [...] are very rich and extremely anxious to give him money or do anything for him in any way, and he rejects all their advances; even Christmas presents or presents of invalid's food, when he is ill, he sends back. And this is not because they aren't on good terms but because he won't have any money he hasn't earned ... It <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> pity." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rundstedt {{was now a}} {{free man}} after four years in custody, but it brought him little joy. He was 73, frail and in poor health. He had no home, no money and no income. The family home in Kassel had been requisitioned by the Americans, and the Rundstedt estate in Saxony-Anhalt was in the Soviet Zone and had been confiscated. His wife was living in Solz, but {{this was in the}} American Zone, where he could not travel because the Americans (who were displeased by the British {{decision}} to release him) still regarded him as a Class 1 war criminal under the denazification laws then in force. Likewise, his money, in a bank account in Kassel, was frozen because of his classification, which also denied him a military pension. The British had assured him {{that he would not be}} arrested or extradited if he stayed in the British Zone, but the Americans had made no such guarantee. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> situation for me and my poor wife," [...] he wrote to Liddell Hart. [...] "I would like to end this life as soon as possible." ...|$|E
