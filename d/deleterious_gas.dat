Relative to the highway outside the tunnel, tunnel inside belongs to semi-closed environment and the drive condition is relatively poor, it makes tunnel become velocity bottleneck. Because of uncirculated air in tunnel {{and all kinds of}} <b>deleterious</b> <b>gas</b> let by vehicle, it is easy to result into traffic jam and secondary disaster. Large-long tunnel system is a complicated system integrated with many-sided theory and technology, such as traffic, detection and environment, and so on.

Wellsite H 2 S {{can come from}} several ways with different diffuse concentration respectively, and the most practical defending method is rational monitoring and emergency measures. Aiming at the wellsite safety when exploiting reservoirs with high pressure, high temperature and high H 2 S component, studies are made in three steps. Firstly, the sources, possible overflow points and overflow quantity of H 2 S are summarized according to field steps including well testing, workover and production. The concept of alarmweight for H 2 S concentration is proposed and weight values corresponding to different alarm level are proposed. Secondly, H 2 S leakage and diffusion are modeled by commercial software, with wellsite equipment, wind and gas leaking rate considered. Thirdly, position and number of monitors are recommended according to operation procedure, and emergency measures are proposed in response to industry standards and field experience.

40|$|Development of {{long-lived}} high-energy lithium-water batteries hinges upon developing solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) {{with the}} appropriate properties. These polymer membranes paradoxically must allow lithium atoms to pass from the metallic surface, oxidize to the ionic form, and then pass through the membrane to the water outside. At the same time, the membrane must exclude all water, tramp ions, and <b>deleterious</b> <b>gases</b> such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. SPE membranes are the leading choice for lithium-water batteries however, because current non-membrane approaches being pursued by other research groups suffer from two insurmountable problems - storage and non-productive energy loss via direct lithium/water reaction.

40|$|In recent years, Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) and Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS) {{projects}} {{are being developed}} in oil and gas fields. SAGD is a heavy oil recovery technology to reduce heavy oil viscosity and extract it from underground. CCS is a technology to inject CO 2, emitted from plants, into a couple of 1000 m deep ground through well. The deterioration of well in SAGD and CCS projects may cause leakage of <b>deleterious</b> <b>gas.</b> In this study, mechanical and chemical degradation of hardened cement paste made of Oil Well Cement (OWC) and Geothermal Well Cement (GWC) containing silica flour in the wells was studied experimentally. In order to imitate the underground condition of SAGD, the cement paste was exposed to the drying and moist sealed condition at 200 °C. In addition, the cement paste was exposed to supercritical CO 2 to reproduce the condition to inject CO 2 gas in CCS well. The compressive strength tests after exposure to 200 °C and thermal analysis to study carbonation after exposure to supercritical CO 2 suggested that the replacement of silica flour to cement is effective {{to be applied to}} both SAGD and CCS injection wells...|$|E

40|$|<b>Deleterious</b> <b>gases</b> such as CO and H 2 S {{can cause}} {{degradation}} of steel by reacting with the metal surface. Here we consider whether alloying the steel surface {{might be able}} to inhibit these damaging surface reactions by raising the barriers to molecular dissociation. We employ first-principles density functional theory techniques to investigate the elementary reaction pathways and barriers for CO and H 2 S on FeAl and Fe 3 Si surfaces and compare them with pure Fe surfaces (as a model for steel). We find that H 2 S dissociates on iron surfaces much more easily than CO does. Although FeAl surfaces raise the barriers for H 2 S dissociation, they significantly lower the barriers for CO dissociation. On the other hand, Fe 3 Si surfaces raise the barriers for CO dissociation, but they are as vulnerable as Fe surfaces to H 2 S dissociation. Our findings suggest that alloying iron with Al or Si is unlikely to simultaneously increase its resistance to the initial stages of chemical degradation by CO and H 2 S. 1...|$|R

To best recognize {{the influence of}} haze days on regional air quality, the pollution levels of <b>deleterious</b> <b>gases</b> of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene and o-xylene) and carbonyls (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone) under haze and non-haze days were contrastively investigated {{during the period of}} September 2008 –August 2010 in Beijing. In comparison with non-haze days, remarkable enhancement of BTEX and the carbonyls under haze days in winter was found, with enhancement factors of 1. 9 – 5. 7 for BTEX and of 1. 5 – 4. 2 for the carbonyls. Whereas the enhancement factors for both BTEX (1. 0 – 3. 0) and the carbonyls (1. 2 – 1. 9) under haze days in summer were relatively small. The ratios of each BTEX to CO under both haze days and non-haze days exhibited a minimal value in the afternoon, whereas maximal values for the ratios of the carbonyls to CO were usually found in the afternoon. The ratios of each BTEX to CO were extremely greater under haze days than those under non-haze days in winter, but no evident difference was found in summer. The ratios of each carbonyl under both haze days and non-haze days in summer were at least a factor of 2 greater than those in winter and only enhancement of the ratios under haze days was found in winter.

40|$|This thesis was {{completed}} {{in order to assess}} and document the environmental effects that are the result of elemental phosphorus production in Pinellas County Florida. The study utilized a collection of information resources that included: personal interviews, technical references, historical documents, legal documents and field observations. By utilizing five different sources of information a broad understanding of the problem was developed. Pinellas County and Tarpon Springs officials were interested in creating a more diversified economy in the years following World War-II. The Victor Chemical Works Company responded to the interest in economic diversity by proposing to build an elemental phosphorus production facility in the area of greater Tarpon Springs, Florida. The elemental phosphorus production facility {{was completed}} and began operation in November of 1947. Three months after the facility commenced production local residents noticed damage to trees and painted surfaces on private properties. Seven months following commencement of elemental phosphorus production local residents filed suit against the Victor Chemical Works Company due to <b>deleterious</b> <b>gasses</b> and dust that appeared to be damaging to biologic health. The elemental phosphorus production facility operated from 1947 to 1981. The 34 -year operational period exposed workers, residents and biologic communities to extended periods of elevated sulfur dioxide, phosphorus pentoxide gas, phosphine gas, fluorine, lead, radium- 226 and asbestos. Utilizing personal interviews, technical document review, legal document review and field observations the thesis provided an amalgamation of diverse information upon which the conclusions were based. The research concludes that the production of elemental phosphorus exposed all physical and cultural environments of northwest Pinellas County to many complex adverse environmental impacts that continue to persist in 2007, approximately 26 -years following the suspension of production...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this model report is to assess the {{potential}} impacts of igneous intrusion on waste packages and waste forms in the emplacement drifts at the Yucca Mountain Repository. The models are based on conceptual models and includes an assessment of deleterious dynamic, thermal, hydrologic, and chemical impacts. The models described in this report constitute the waste package and waste form impacts submodel of the Total System Performance Assessment for the License Application (TSPA-LA) model assessing the impacts of a hypothetical igneous intrusion event on the repository total system performance. This submodel is carried out in accordance with Technical Work Plan for Waste Form Degradation Modeling, Testing, and Analyses in Support of LA (BSC 2004 [DIRS: 167796]) and Total System Performance Assessment-License Application Methods and Approaches (BSC 2003 [DIRS: 166296]). The technical work plan was prepared in accordance with AP- 2. 27 Q, Planning for Science Activities. Any deviations from the technical work plan are documented {{in the following sections}} as they occur. The TSPA-LA approach to implementing the models for waste package and waste form response during igneous intrusion is based on identification of damage zones. Zone 1 includes all emplacement drifts intruded by the basalt dike, and Zone 2 includes all other emplacement drifts in the repository that are not in Zone 1. This model report will document the following model assessments: (1) Mechanical and thermal impacts of basalt magma intrusion on the invert, waste packages and waste forms of the intersected emplacement drifts of Zone 1. (2) Temperature and pressure trends of basaltic magma intrusion intersecting Zone 1 and their potential effects on waste packages and waste forms in Zone 2 emplacement drifts. (3) <b>Deleterious</b> volatile <b>gases,</b> exsolving from the intruded basalt magma and their potential effects on waste packages of Zone 2 emplacement drifts. (4) Post-intrusive physical-chemical environment and seepage water alteration by reaction with intruded basalt. The scope of this model only includes impacts to the components stated above, and does not include impacts to other engineered barrier system (EBS) components such as the waste package pallet. The results of this model report will be used in TSPA for several parameters including (1) temperature of magma (used for the temperature of the waste form after an intrusion) (2) temperature increase in Zone 2 due to intrusion to evaluate impact to Zone 2 waste packages; (3) effects of exsolved gases reaching Zone 2 to evaluate impact to Zone 2 waste packages; and (4) pH and ionic strength of water reacted with basalt to be used in conjunction with ''Dissolved Concentration Limits of Radioactive Elements'' (BSC 2003 [DIRS: 163152]) to determine solubility of spent fuel within the basalt.

40|$|Due to {{its wide}} {{industrial}} use, chromium (Cr) {{is considered a}} serious environmental pollutant of aquatic bodies. in order to investigate the ecophysiological responses of water hyacinth [Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms] to Cr treatment, plants were exposed to 1 and 10 mM Cr(2) O(3) (Cr(3 +)) and K(2) Cr(2) O(7) (Cr(6 +)) concentrations for two or 4 days in a hydroponic system. Plants exposed to the higher concentration of Cr(6 +) for 4 days did not survive, whereas a 2 days treatment with 1 mM Cr(3 +) apparently stimulated growth. Analysis of Cr uptake indicated {{that most of the}} Cr accumulated in the roots, but some was also translocated and accumulated in the leaves. However, in plants exposed to Cr(6 +) (1 mM), a higher translocation of Cr from roots to shoots was observed. {{it is possible that the}} conversion from Cr(6 +) to Cr(3 +), which immobilizes Cr in roots, was not total due to the presence of Cr(6 +), causing <b>deleterious</b> effects on <b>gas</b> exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence and photosynthetic pigment contents. Chlorophyll a was more sensitive to Cr than chlorophyll b. Cr(3 +) was shown to be less toxic than Cr(6 +) and, in some cases even increased photosynthesis and chlorophyll content. This result indicated that the F(v) /F(0) ratio was more effective than the F(v) /F(m) ratio in monitoring the development of stress by Cr(6 +). There was a linear relationship between qP and F(v) /F(m). No statistical differences were observed in NPQ and chlorophyll a/b ratio, but there was a tendency to decrease these values with Cr exposure. This suggests that there were alterations in thylakoid stacking, which might explain the data obtained for gas exchanges and other chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Water {{production}} {{is a challenge}} in production operations because it is generally costly to produce, treat, and it can hamper hydrocarbon production. This {{is especially true for}} gas wells in unconventional reservoirs like shale because the relatively low gas rates increase the economic impact of water handling costs. Therefore, we have considered the following questions regarding water production from shale gas wells: (1) What is the effect of water production on gas production? (2) What are the different water producing mechanisms? and (3) What is the water production potential of a new well in a given gas shale province. The first question was answered by reviewing relevant literature, highlighting observed deficiencies in previous approaches, and making recommendations for future work. The second question was answered using a spreadsheet based Water-Gas-Ratio analysis tool while the third question was investigated by using artificial neural networks (ANN) to decipher the relationship between completion, fracturing, and water production data. We will consequently use the defined relationship to predict the average water production for a new well drilled in the Barnett Shale. This study also derived additional insight into the production trends in the Barnett shale using standard statistical methods. The following conclusions were reached {{at the end of the}} study: 1) The observation that water production does not have long term <b>deleterious</b> effect on <b>gas</b> production from fractured wells in tight gas sands cannot be directly extended to fractured wells in gas shales because the two reservoir types do not have analogous production mechanisms. 2) Based on average operating conditions of well in the Barnett Shale, liquid loading was found to be an important phenomenon; especially for vertical wells. 3) A neural network was successfully used to predict average water production potential from a well drilled in the Barnett shale. Similar methodology can be used to predict average gas production potential. Results from this work can be utilized to mitigate risk of water problems in new Barnett Shale wells and predict water issues in other shale plays. Engineers will be provided a tool to predict potential for water production in new wells...|$|R
