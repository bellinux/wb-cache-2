40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} back pain questionnaires for lumbar <b>disc</b> <b>screening</b> among Korean young males. Methods: We carried out a survey for lumbar <b>disc</b> <b>screening</b> through back pain questionnaires among the volunteers with or without back pain. Three types of back pain questionnaire (Oswestry Low Back Pain Score, Aberdeen Low Back Pain Scale, and Acute Low Back Pain Screeing Questionnaire) {{were randomly assigned to}} the examinees. The authors reviewed lumbar imaging studies (simple lumbar radiographs, lumbar computed tomography, and magnetic resolutional images), and the severity of lumbar disc herniation was categorized according to the guidelines issued by the Korean military directorate. We calculated the relationship between the back pain questionnaire scores and the severity of lumbar disc herniation. Results: The scores of back pain questionnaires increased according to the severity of lumbar disc herniation. But, the range of scores was very vague, so it is less predictable to detect lumbar disc herniation using only back pain questionnaires. The sensitivity between the back pain questionnaires and the presence of lumbar disc herniation was low (16 - 64 %).

40|$|The {{technologies}} for {{the conversion of}} biomass for electricity production are direct combustion, gasification, and pyrolysis. As shown in Figure 1, direct combustion involves the oxidation of biomass with excess air, producing hot flue gases which in turn produce steam in the heat exchange sections of boilers. The steam is used to generate electricity in a Rankine cycle; usually, only electricity is produced in a condensing steam cycle, while electricity and steam are cogenerated in an extracting steam cycle. Today's biomass-fired steam cycle plants typically use single-pass steam turbines. However, in the past decade, efficiencies and more complex design features, characteristic previously of only large scale steam turbine generators (> 200 MW), have been transferred to smaller capacity units. Today’s biomass designs include reheat and regenerative steam cycles as well as supercritical steam turbines. The two common boiler configurations used for steam generation with biomass are stationary- and traveling-grate combustors (stokers) and atmospheric fluid-bed combustors. Figure 1. Direct-fired biomass electricity generating system schematic. All biomass combustion systems require feedstock storage and handling systems. The 50 MW McNeil station, located in Burlington, Vermont, uses a spreader-stoker boiler for steam generation, and has a typical feed system for wood chips [1].

The investigated pre-treatment technologies were screw press, <b>disc</b> <b>screen</b> and shredder + magnet. The average quantity of pre-treated organic waste (biomass) produced from the incoming waste varied between the investigated pre-treatment technologies: 59 %, 66 % and 98 % wet weight, respectively (41 %, 34 % and 2 % reject, respectively). The pre-treatment technologies showed differences with respect to distribution of the chemical components in the waste between the biomass and the rejected material (reject), especially for dry matter, ash, collection bag material (plastic or paper) and easily degradable organic matter. Furthermore, the particle size of the biomass {{was related to the}} pre-treatment technology. The content of plastic in the biomass depended both on the actual collection bag material used in the system and the pre-treatment technology. The sampled reject consisted mostly of organic matter. For cities using plastic bags for the source-separated organic waste, the expected content of plastic in the reject was up to 10 % wet weight (in some cases up to 20 %). Batch tests for methane potential of the biomass samples showed only minor variations caused by the factors city, pre-treatment technology, dwelling type and season when based on the VS content of the waste (overall average 459 STP m(3) /t VS). The amount of methane generated from 1 t of collected waste was therefore mainly determined by the efficiency of the chosen pre-treatment technology described by the mass distribution of the incoming waste between biomass and reject.

40|$|Issue: The {{wood waste}} {{delivered}} to a processing facility typically contains a certain quantity of small-sized wood (chips and chunks), fines, and small contaminants {{mixed in with}} the larger pieces of wood waste. This material can cause problems for the processing facility. The small-sized wood and fines complicates manual sorting activities because they overwhelming sorters with a many individual pieces that hide internal contaminants, which appear upon the conveyor. The wood fines are also typically mixed with dirt and grit contaminants. The combination of fines, dirt, and grit tend to cause excessive wear on material-handling and size-reduction equipment, thus creating excessive equipment maintenance requirements. Finally, the small contaminants can be easily missed by manual and automated contaminant removal systems before the size reducing process. Failure to remove these small contaminants could lead to excessive requirements on equipment maintenance and degrade the quality of the end-product.

40|$|The {{quality of}} the waste {{sampling}} procedure and chemical analysis was evaluated in a research program on characterization of organic waste obtained after <b>disc</b> <b>screening</b> of source-separated organic household waste. The sampling procedures focused on a truckload of waste and involved several steps of subsampling including shredding, mixing, blending, high-speed-blending, drying and milling prior to analysis of the organic waste with respect to ash content, crude fibers, crude fat, crude protein, sugar, starch, enzyme-digestible organic matter, P, N, C, H, S and calorific value. The statistical evaluation of the procedures involved 10 samples of the same truckload of waste obtained by splitting the sample at each level in the procedure according to a staggered, incomplete nested statistical design. Furthermore, one sample was analysed six times {{over a period of}} approximately one year. The statistical evaluation showed that no single step in the sampling procedure contributed with excessive variance and that the variance caused by the sampling procedure was approximately the same as the variance in the chemical analysis observed over a year. The variance varied with the analytical parameter but for most parameters the uncertainty was satisfactorily low (of the order of 3 - 10 % expressed as the relative standard deviation, which is considered to be satisfactory for waste characterization).

40|$|The morphologic {{appearance}} of the optic disc is of interest in glaucoma. In contrast to descriptive classification systems that are currently used, a quantitative approach {{to the analysis of}} optic disc morphology is required. Our goal was to determine the optimal method for quantifying optic cup shape by comparing traditional (ovality, form-factor and neuroretinal rim (NRR) width ratio) and geometric morphometric approaches. Left optic disc stereophotographs of 160 (80 normal and 80 glaucomatous (stratified by severity)) subjects were examined. The optic cup margins were stereoscopically delineated with a custom tracing system and saved as a series of discrete points. The geometric morphometric methods of elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA) and sliding semi-landmark analysis (SSLA) were used to eliminate variation unrelated to shape (e. g. size) and yield a series of shape variables. Differences in optic cup shape between normal and glaucoma groups were investigated. Discriminant functions were computed and the sensitivity and specificity of each technique determined. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated for all methods and evaluated in their potential to discriminate between normal and glaucomatous eyes based on the shape variables. All geometric morphometric methods revealed differences between normal and glaucomatous eyes in optic cup shape, in addition to the traditional parameters of ovality, form-factor and NRR width ratio (p< 0. 0005). SSLA (minimum bending energy criterion - 18 points) had the best sensitivity (83 %) and area under the curve (AUC) (0. 91). EFA (72 points) performed similarly well (74 %, 0. 89) as did the set of traditional shape-based variables (76 %, 0. 86). This study demonstrated that a geometric morphometric approach for discriminating between normal and glaucomatous eyes in optic cup shape is superior to that provided by traditional single parameter shape measures. Such analytical techniques could be incorporated into future automated optic <b>disc</b> <b>screening</b> modalities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} spectroscopic {{investigation of the}} young eruptive star PV Cep, to improve our understanding of its nature and characterise its circumstellar environment after its last outburst in 2004. The analysis of our medium-resolution spectroscopy in the near-IR (0. 9 - 2. 35 um), collected in 2012 at the Large Binocular Telescope with the IR spectrograph LUCIFER, allows us to infer the main stellar parameters (visual extinction, accretion luminosity, mass accretion and ejection rates), and model the inner disc, jet, and wind. The NIR spectrum displays several strong emission lines associated with accretion/ejection activity and circumstellar environment. Our analysis shows that the brightness of PV Cep is fading, {{as well as the}} mass accretion rate (2 x 10 ^- 7 Msun/yr^- 1 in 2012 vs ~ 5 x 10 ^- 6 Msun/yr^- 1 in 2004), which is more than one order of magnitude lower than in the outburst phase. Among the several emission lines, only the [FeII] intensity increased after the outburst. The observed [FeII] emission delineates blue- and red-shifted lobes, both with high- and low-velocity components, which trace an asymmetric jet and wind, respectively. The observed emission in the jet has a dynamical age of ~ 8 years, indicating that it was produced during the last outburst. The mass ejection rate in both lobes is 1. 5 x 10 ^- 7 Msun/yr^- 1, approximately matching the high accretion rate observed during and immediately after the outburst. The observed jet/outflow asymmetries are consistent with an inhomogeneous medium. Our modelling of the CO emission hints at a small-scale gaseous disc ring, extending from ~ 0. 2 - 0. 4 AU to ~ 3 AU from the source, with an inner temperature of ~ 3000 K.

Young stellar objects (YSOs) occasionally experience enhanced accretion events, the nature of which is still poorly understood. The discovery of various embedded outbursting YSOs has recently questioned the classical definition of EXors and FUors. Aims. We present a detailed spectroscopic investigation of the young eruptive star PV[*]Cep, to improve our understanding of its nature and characterise its circumstellar environment after its last outburst in 2004. Methods. The analysis of our medium-resolution spectroscopy in the near-infrared (NIR, 0. 9 – 2. 35 μm), collected in 2012 at the Large Binocular Telescope with the IR spectrograph LUCIFER, allows us to infer the main stellar parameters (visual extinction, accretion luminosity, mass accretion and ejection rates), and model the inner disc, jet, and wind. Results. The NIR spectrum displays several strong emission lines associated with accretion/ejection activity and circumstellar environment. Our analysis shows that the brightness of PV[*]Cep is fading, {{as well as the}} mass accretion rate (2  ×  10 - 7 [*]M⊙[*]yr- 1 in 2012 vs. ~ 5  ×  10 - 6 [*]M⊙[*]yr- 1 in 2004), which is more than one order of magnitude lower than in the outburst phase. Among the several emission lines, only the [Fe II] intensity increased after the outburst. The observed [Fe[*]II] emission delineates blue- and red-shifted lobes, both with high- and low-velocity components, which trace an asymmetric jet and wind, respectively. The observed emission in the jet has a dynamical age of 7 – 8 years, indicating that it was produced during the last outburst. The visual extinction decreases moving from the red-shifted (AV(red) = 10. 1 ± 0. 7 [*]mag) to the blue-shifted lobe (AV(blue) = 6. 5 ± 0. 4 [*]mag). We measure an average electron temperature of 17 [*] 500 [*]K and electron densities of 30 [*] 000 [*]cm- 3 and 15 [*] 000 [*]cm- 3 for the blue and the red lobe, respectively. The mass ejection rate in both lobes is ~ 1. 5  ×  10 - 7 [*]M⊙[*]yr- 1, approximately matching the high accretion rate observed during and immediately after the outburst (Ṁout/Ṁacc ~  0. 05 – 0. 1). The observed jet/outflow asymmetries are consistent with an inhomogeneous medium.

Colonization with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBLE) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) was detected using a <b>disc</b> diffusion <b>screening</b> test and ESBLE were characterized using WGS. Risk factor data were collected by questionnaire. Results Ninety-two children (23 %) were colonized with ESBLE, mainly Escherichia coli carrying bla CTX-M and Klebsiella pneumoniae carrying bla SHV or bla CTX-M, which were frequently resistant to multiple antibiotic classes. Although residence in Vientiane Capital, foreign travel, higher maternal level of education, antibiotic use in the preceding 3 months and attending a childcare facility with a ‘good’ level of hygiene were all associated with ESBLE colonization on univariable analysis, a significant association remained only for antibiotic use when a stepwise approach was used with a multivariate random-effects model. WGS analysis suggested transmission in both childcare facilities and community settings. Conclusions The high prevalence of paediatric colonization with ESBLE in Laos, one of the highest reported in Asia, is probably the result of inappropriate antibiotic use. Paediatric colonization with CPE was not identified in this study, {{but it is important to}} continue to monitor the spread of antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in Laos. </p...|$|R
40|$|Clogging, {{measured}} through {{head loss}} across filters, and the filtration quality of different filters using different effluents were studied. The filters used were: 115, 130, and 200 m disc filters; 98, 115, 130, and 178 m screen filters; and a sand filter {{filled with a}} single layer of sand with an effective diameter of 0. 65 mm. The filters were used with a meat industry effluent and secondary and tertiary effluents of two wastewater treatment plants. It was observed that clogging depended {{on the type of}} effluent. With the meat industry effluent, the poorest quality effluent, disc filters clogged more than the other filter types. When the wastewater treatment plant effluents were used, the disc filters showed less frequent clogging. Several physical and chemical parameters, such as total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, turbidity, electrical conductivity, pH, and number of particles, were analyzed in the effluents at the entry and exit points of the filters. In general, filters did not reduce the values of the main clogging parameters to a great degree. It was found that the parameter that explained the clogging, expressed as Boucher’s filterability index, was different {{depending on the type of}} effluent and filter. The best quality of filtration was achieved with a sand filter when the meat industry effluent was used. No significant differences were observed between the quality of filtration of <b>disc</b> and <b>screen</b> filters when operating with the secondary and tertiary effluent...|$|R
40|$|Tonic and phasic {{dynamics}} of electroencephalographic (EEG) activities during a continuous compensatory tracking task (CTT) {{were analyzed using}} time-frequency analysis of EEG sources identified by independent component analysis (ICA). In 1 -hour sessions, 70 -channel EEG data were recorded while participants attempted to use frequent compensatory trackball movements to maintain a drifting disc close to a bulls-eye at <b>screen</b> center. <b>Disc</b> trajectories were converted into two moving-average performance measures, root mean square distance of the <b>disc</b> from <b>screen</b> center in 4 -s ('local') and in 20 -s ('global') moving time windows. Maximally independent EEG processes and their equivalent dipole source locations were obtained using the EEGLAB toolbox ([URL] Across subjects and sessions, independent EEG processes in occipital, somatomotor, and supplementary motor cortices exhibited tonic power increases during periods of high tracking error, plus additional phasic power increases in several frequency bands before and after trackball movements following disc 'perigees' (moments at which the disc began to drift away from the bulls-eye). These phasic activity increases, which were larger during high-error periods, reveal an intimate relation between EEG dynamics and top-down recognition of responding to threatening events. Thus during a continuous tracking task without impulsive stimulus onsets, sub-second scale EEG dynamics related to visuomotor task could be dissociated from slower spectral modulations linked to changes in performance and arousal. We tentatively interpret the observed EEG signal increases as indexing tonic and phasic modulations of the levels of task attention and engagement required to maintain visuomotor performance during sustained performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{observed}} {{evolution of}} the broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) in NS X-ray Nova Aql X- 1 during the rise phase of a bright FRED-type outburst in 2013 can be understood {{in the framework of}} thermal emission from unstationary accretion disc with temperature radial distribution transforming from a single-temperature blackbody emitting ring into the multi-colour irradiated accretion disc. SED evolution during the hard to soft X-ray state transition looks curious, as it can not be repro- duced by the standard disc irradiation model with a single irradiation parameter for NUV, Optical and NIR spectral bands. NIR (NUV) band is correlated with soft (hard) X-ray flux changes during the state transition interval, respectively. In our interpreta- tion, at the moment of X-ray state transition UV-emitting parts of the accretion <b>disc</b> are <b>screened</b> from direct X-ray illumination from the central source and are heated primary by hard X-rays (E > 10 keV), scattered in the hot corona or wind possibly formed above the optically-thick outer accretion flow; the outer edge of multi-colour disc, which emits in Optical-NIR, can be heated primary by direct X-ray illumination. We point out that future simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of X-ray Nova systems during the fast X-ray state transition interval are of great importance, as it can serve as 'X-ray tomograph' to study physical conditions in outer regions of accretion flow. This can provide an effective tool to directly test the energy-dependent X-ray heating efficiency, vertical structure and accretion flow geometry in transient LMXBs.
