5|$|The al-Aqsa Mosque {{has seven}} aisles of <b>hypostyle</b> naves with several {{additional}} small halls {{to the west}} and east of the southern section of the building. There are 121 stained glass windows in the mosque from the Abbasid and Fatimid eras. About a fourth of them were restored in 1924.|$|E
5|$|The mosque {{is located}} on north Muizz Street. It is notable for its façade, which is elaborately {{decorated}} with inscriptions and geometric carving. It is both the first mosque in Cairo to have such decoration, and also the first to have a façade which follows {{the line of the}} street, built at an angle to the rectangular <b>hypostyle</b> hall whose orientation is dictated by the qibla direction.|$|E
5|$|Thutmose I {{organized}} great {{building projects}} during his reign, including many temples and tombs, but his greatest projects {{were at the}} Temple of Karnak {{under the supervision of}} the architect Ineni. Previous to Thutmose, Karnak probably consisted only of a long road to a central platform, with a number of shrines for the solar bark along the side of the road. Thutmose was the first king to drastically enlarge the temple. Thutmose had the fifth pylon built along the temple's main road, along with a wall to run around the inner sanctuary and two flagpoles to flank the gateway. Outside of this, he built a fourth pylon and another enclosure wall. Between pylons four and five, he had a <b>hypostyle</b> hall constructed, with columns made of cedar wood. This type of structure was common in ancient Egyptian temples, and supposedly represents a papyrus marsh, an Egyptian symbol of creation. Along the edge of this room he built colossal statues, each one alternating wearing the crown of Upper Egypt and the crown of Lower Egypt. Finally, outside of the fourth pylon, he erected four more flagpoles and two obelisks, although one of them, which now has fallen, was not inscribed until Thutmose III inscribed it about 50 years later. The cedar columns in Thutmose I's <b>hypostyle</b> hall were replaced with stone columns by Thutmose III, however at least the northernmost two were replaced by Thutmose I himself. Hatshepsut also erected two of her own obelisks inside of Thutmose I's <b>hypostyle</b> hall.|$|E
5|$|Two {{doors at}} the {{south-east}} and south-west corners of the courtyard led to a small <b>hypostyle</b> hall with four pairs of red granite pillars. Beyond were storage chambers and the inner sanctum with three (Ricke) or five (Lauer) statue niches where statues of the king would have been placed, facing the pyramid to the north. Contrary to other mortuary temples, the inner sanctum was thus separated from the pyramid by the courtyard. The only remains of the mortuary temple that are visible today are its basalt paving and the large granite blocks framing the outer door.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} preserved ancient Egyptian temples, such {{as those}} at Giza, consist of single, enclosed halls with roof slabs supported by columns. In the New Kingdom, architects added the pylon, the open courtyard, and the enclosed <b>hypostyle</b> hall {{to the front of}} the temple's sanctuary, a style that was standard until the Greco-Roman period. The earliest and most popular tomb architecture in the Old Kingdom was the mastaba, a flat-roofed rectangular structure of mudbrick or stone built over an underground burial chamber. The step pyramid of Djoser is a series of stone mastabas stacked on top of each other. Pyramids were built during the Old and Middle Kingdoms, but most later rulers abandoned them in favor of less conspicuous rock-cut tombs. The Twenty-fifth dynasty was a notable exception, as all Twenty-fifth dynasty pharaohs constructed pyramids.|$|E
5|$|It has {{intricate}} carvings, with inscriptions in Quranic script. The mosque, in a walled enclosure, {{is made of}} interlocking coral blocks {{with its}} <b>hypostyle</b> roof supported by cut-coral columns. With three entrances, the mosque has two prayer halls surrounded by antechambers on three sides. Its vaulted, decorated ceiling is indented in steps. Local master carpenters, known as maavadikaleyge, fashioned the mosque's woodwork, roof and interior, and its wall panels and ceilings have many culturally-significant examples of traditional Maldivian woodcarving and lacquerwork. The mihrab, with a mimbar (pulpit) at one end, is a large chamber. The main building, used for daily prayers, {{is divided into three}} sections: the mihtab (used by the imam to lead the prayers), the medhu miskiy (the mosque's central area) and the fahu miskiy (the rear of the mosque). A long, carved 13th-century panel memorializes the introduction of Islam to Maldives.|$|E
5|$|After their {{original}} religious activities ceased, Egyptian temples suffered slow decay. Many were defaced by Christians trying {{to erase the}} remnants of ancient Egyptian religion. Some temple buildings, such as the mammisi at Dendera or the <b>hypostyle</b> hall at Philae, were adapted into churches or other types of buildings. Most commonly the sites were left disused, as at the Temple of Khnum at Elephantine, while locals carried off their stones to serve as material for new buildings. The dismantling of temples for stone continued well into modern times. Limestone was especially useful {{as a source of}} lime, so temples built of limestone were almost all dismantled. Sandstone temples, found mostly in Upper Egypt, were more likely to survive. What humans left intact was still subject to natural weathering. Temples in desert areas could be partly covered by drifts of sand, while those near the Nile, particularly in Lower Egypt, were often buried under layers of river-borne silt. Thus, some major temple sites like Memphis were reduced to ruin, while many temples far from the Nile and centers of population remained mostly intact. With understanding of the hieroglyphic script lost, the information about Egyptian culture that was preserved in the surviving temples lay incomprehensible to the world.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's main {{new project}} at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century was the Park Güell (1900–1914), commissioned by Eusebi Güell. It was intended to be a residential estate in the style of an English garden city. The project was unsuccessful: of the 60 plots into which the site was divided only one was sold. Despite this, the park entrances and service areas were built, displaying Gaudí's genius and putting into practice many of his innovative structural solutions. The Park Güell is situated in Barcelona's Càrmel district, a rugged area, with steep slopes that Gaudí negotiated with a system of viaducts integrated into the terrain. The main entrance to the park has a building on each side, intended as a porter's lodge and an office, and the site is surrounded by a stone and glazed-ceramic wall. These entrance buildings are an example of Gaudí at the height of his powers, with Catalan vaults that form a parabolic hyperboloid. After passing through the gate, steps lead to higher levels, decorated with sculpted fountains, notably the dragon fountain, which has become a symbol of the park and one of Gaudí's most recognised emblems. These steps lead to the <b>Hypostyle</b> Hall, which was to have been the residents' market, constructed with large Doric columns. Above this chamber is a large plaza in the form of a Greek theatre, with the famous undulating bench covered in broken ceramics ("trencadís"), the work of Josep Maria Jujol. The park's show home, the work of Francesc Berenguer, was Gaudí's residence from 1906 to 1926, and currently houses the Casa-Museu Gaudí.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Hypostyle,</b> i.e., an open hall {{supported}} by columns {{combined with a}} reception hall set at right angle to the main hall, {{is considered to be}} derived from architectural traditions of Achaemenid period Persian assembly halls ("apadana"). This type of building originated from the Roman-style basilica with an adjacent courtyard surrounded by colonnades, like Trajan's Forum in Rome. The Roman type of building has developed out of the Greek agora. In Islamic architecture, the <b>hypostyle</b> hall is the main feature of the <b>hypostyle</b> mosque. One of the earliest <b>hypostyle</b> mosques is the Tarikhaneh Mosque in Iran, dating back to the 8th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{styles in}} Islamic architecture produced Arab-plan or <b>hypostyle</b> mosques during the Umayyad Dynasty. These mosques follow a square or rectangular plan with enclosed courtyard and covered prayer hall. Most early <b>hypostyle</b> mosques had flat prayer hall roofs, which required numerous columns and supports. The Mezquita in Córdoba, Spain was constructed as a <b>hypostyle</b> mosque supported by over 850 columns. Arab-plan mosques continued under the Abbasid dynasty.|$|E

25|$|Archaeological {{finds in}} this part of the temple include a {{limestone}} altar, a granite stele and six granite statues of Senusret III. To the west, the courtyard leads to the <b>hypostyle</b> hall with its ten rows of eight columns each, plus two additional columns on both sides of the entrance. The <b>hypostyle</b> hall is separated from the courtyard by a wall and, being also higher, is accessed via a small ramp.|$|E

25|$|In many mosques, {{especially}} the early congregational mosques, the prayer hall {{is in the}} <b>hypostyle</b> form (the roof held up by a multitude of columns). One of the finest examples of the hypostyle-plan mosques is the Great Mosque of Kairouan (also known as the Mosque of Uqba) in Tunisia.|$|E
25|$|The Great Mosque of Kairouan (in Tunisia) is {{considered}} the ancestor of all the mosques in the western Islamic world. Its original marble columns and sculptures were of Roman workmanship brought in from Carthage and other elements resemble Roman form. It {{is one of the}} best preserved and most significant examples of early great mosques, founded in 670 AD and dating in its present form largely from the Aghlabid period (9th century). The Great Mosque of Kairouan is constituted of a massive square minaret, a large courtyard surrounded by porticos and a huge <b>hypostyle</b> prayer hall covered on its axis by two cupolas. The Great Mosque of Samarra in Iraq, completed in 847 AD, combined the <b>hypostyle</b> architecture of rows of columns supporting a flat base above which a huge spiraling minaret was constructed.|$|E
25|$|Horemheb was a {{prolific}} builder who erected numerous temples and buildings throughout Egypt during his reign. He constructed the Second, Ninth and Tenth Pylons of the Great <b>Hypostyle</b> Hall, in the Temple at Karnak, using recycled talatat blocks from Akhenaten's own monuments here, as building {{material for the}} first two Pylons.|$|E
25|$|The widest span of {{a temple}} roof was across the cella, or {{internal}} space. In a large building, this space contains columns to support the roof, the architectural form being known as <b>hypostyle.</b> It appears that, although the architecture of ancient Greece was initially of wooden construction, the early builders {{did not have the}} concept of the diagonal truss as a stabilising member. This is evidenced by the nature of temple construction in the 6th century BC, where the rows of columns supporting the roof the cella rise higher than the outer walls, unnecessary if roof trusses are employed {{as an integral part of}} the wooden roof. The indication is that initially all the rafters were supported directly by the entablature, walls and <b>hypostyle,</b> rather than on a trussed wooden frame, which came into use in Greek architecture only in the 3rd century BC.|$|E
25|$|The {{temple of}} Edfu fell into disuse as a {{religious}} monument following Theodosius I's edict banning non-Christian worship within the Roman Empire in 391. As elsewhere, many of the temple's carved reliefs were razed by followers of the Christian faith which came to dominate Egypt. The blackened ceiling of the <b>hypostyle</b> hall, visible today, {{is believed to be}} the result of arson intended to destroy religious imagery that was then considered pagan.|$|E
25|$|The mosque's {{interior}} {{also has}} an irregular layout mostly due to Ibrahim Agha's renovations which replaced most of the original cross-vaulting of the arcades with columns supporting a flat wooden ceiling. The {{only part of the}} mosque that continues to employ Aqsunqur's interior design is the qibla wall which uses cross-vaults that rest on octagonal-shaped piers. The technique of cross-vaults is a reflection of Islamic Syrian architectural influence. Along with the Mosque of Amir al-Maridani, the Aqsunqur Mosque has a <b>hypostyle</b> plan which is rare in Cairo and typically associated with Syrian style mosques.|$|E
25|$|As {{the larger}} temple {{dedicated}} to the king, the <b>hypostyle</b> hall or pronaos is supported by six pillars; in this case, however, they are not Osiris pillars depicting the king, but are decorated with scenes with the queen playing the sistrum (an instrument sacred to the goddess Hathor), together with the gods Horus, Khnum, Khonsu, and Thoth, and the goddesses Hathor, Isis, Maat, Mut of Asher, Satis and Taweret; in one scene Ramesses is presenting flowers or burning incense. The capitals of the pillars bear {{the face of the}} goddess Hathor; this type of column is known as Hathoric. The bas-reliefs in the pillared hall illustrate the deification of the king, the destruction of his enemies in the north and south (in this scenes the king is accompanied by his wife), and the queen making offerings to the goddess Hathor and Mut. The <b>hypostyle</b> hall is followed by a vestibule, access to which is given by three large doors. On the south and the north walls of this chamber there are two graceful and poetic bas-reliefs of the king and his consort presenting papyrus plants to Hathor, who is depicted as a cow on a boat sailing in a thicket of papyri. On the west wall, RamessesII and Nefertari are depicted making offerings to god Horus and the divinities of the Cataracts — Satis, Anubis and Khnum.|$|E
25|$|The Minoan {{architecture}} of Crete, was of trabeated form {{like that of}} ancient Greece. It employed wooden columns with capitals, but the columns were of very different form to Doric columns, being narrow at the base and splaying upward. The earliest forms of columns in Greece seem to have developed independently. As with Minoan architecture, ancient Greek domestic architecture centred on open spaces or courtyards surrounded by colonnades. This form was adapted {{to the construction of}} <b>hypostyle</b> halls within the larger temples. The evolution that occurred in architecture was towards public building, first and foremost the temple, rather than towards grand domestic architecture such as had evolved in Crete.|$|E
25|$|Information {{about the}} life and reign of Ashoka {{primarily}} comes from {{a relatively small number}} of Buddhist sources. In particular, the Sanskrit Ashokavadana ('Story of Ashoka'), written in the 2nd century, and the two Pāli chronicles of Sri Lanka (the Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa) provide most of the currently known information about Ashoka. Additional information is contributed by the Edicts of Ashoka, whose authorship was finally attributed to the Ashoka of Buddhist legend after the discovery of dynastic lists that gave the name used in the edicts (Priyadarshi—'He who regards everyone with affection') as a title or additional name of Ashoka Maurya. Architectural remains of his period have been found at Kumhrar, Patna, which include an 80-pillar <b>hypostyle</b> hall.|$|E
25|$|Established by the Arab general Uqba ibn Nafi in 670 AD (the year 50 {{according}} to the Islamic calendar) at {{the founding of the}} city of Kairouan, the mosque is spread over a surface area of 9,000 square metres and {{it is one of the}} oldest places of worship in the Islamic world, as well as a model for all later mosques in the Maghreb. The Great Mosque of Kairouan is one of the most impressive and largest Islamic monuments in North Africa; its perimeter is almost equal to 405 metres (1,328 feet). This space contains a <b>hypostyle</b> prayer hall, a marble-paved courtyard and a square minaret. In addition to its spiritual prestige, the Mosque of Uqba is one of the masterpieces of both architecture and Islamic art.|$|E
25|$|The roofed {{colonnade}} {{led from}} the enclosure wall {{to the south of}} the complex. A passageway with a limestone ceiling constructed to look as though it was made from whole tree trunks led to a massive stone imitation of two open doors. Beyond this portal was a hall with twenty pairs of limestone columns composed of drum shaped segments built to look like bundles of plant stems and reaching a height of 6.6 m. The columns were not free-standing, but were attached to the wall by masonry projections. Between the columns {{on both sides of the}} hall were small chambers, which some Egyptologists propose may have been for each of the provinces of Upper and Lower Egypt. At the end of the colonnade was the transverse <b>hypostyle</b> room with eight columns connected in pairs by blocks of limestone. This led to the South Court.|$|E
25|$|The inner part of {{the temple}} has the same {{triangular}} layout that most ancient Egyptian temples follow, with rooms decreasing in size from {{the entrance to the}} sanctuary. The temple is complex in structure and quite unusual because of its many side chambers. The <b>hypostyle</b> hall (sometimes also called a pronaos) is 18 meters long and 16.7 meters wide and is supported by eight huge Osirid pillars depicting the deified Ramses linked to the god Osiris, the god of the Underworld, to indicate the everlasting nature of the pharaoh. The colossal statues along the left-hand wall bear the white crown of Upper Egypt, while those on the opposite side are wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt (pschent). The bas-reliefs {{on the walls of the}} pronaos depict battle scenes in the military campaigns the ruler waged. Much of the sculpture is given to the Battle of Kadesh, on the Orontes river in present-day Syria, in which the Egyptian king fought against the Hittites. The most famous relief shows the king on his chariot shooting arrows against his fleeing enemies, who are being taken prisoner. Other scenes show Egyptian victories in Libya and Nubia.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} types of {{different}} materials that are used throughout this building. The main materials used in the building envelope consist of concrete, glass, granite and steel. The curtain wall facade of this building uses large glass panels, framed with black granite framing. While the glass used for the lower box is completely transparent, the curtain wall for the upper seven floors uses fritted glass {{with a series of}} light gray circles, each approximately the size of a CD. This creates a protective screen that hinders view out from the building, but provides privacy to its users while reducing heat gain, and maintaining a certain level of sophistication is its aesthetics at the same time. Each of the twelve <b>hypostyle</b> columns are made of reinforced concrete. The columns supporting the tower are Agilia Concrete, which is more enhanced in design effect and construction process compared to traditional concretes: it can be placed 50% faster than the traditional concrete, and form complex shapes that would have been impossible in previous years. Each colossal column spans spanning one meter in diameter and 19 meters high; each one was constructed in a single pour in order to achieve the highest quality and a sense of grace and elegance. A striking urban colonnade is created through this series of columns; asserting its presence on campus while setting distinct boundaries between the street, public space of the campus and the privacy of the pharmacy faculty. Self-compacting concrete is used as the structural support system {{throughout the rest of the}} structure. The pods were constructed as “steel baskets” suspended by steel rods. The shells of these pods are constructed of structural steel and plaster and silver reflective paint are used for the finishes of these pods.|$|E
500|$|<b>Hypostyle</b> halls, covered rooms {{filled with}} columns, appear in temples {{throughout}} Egyptian history. By the New Kingdom they typically lay {{directly in front}} of the sanctuary area. These halls were less restricted than the inner rooms, being open to laymen at least in some cases. They were often less dark as well: New Kingdom halls rose into tall central passages over the processional path, allowing a clerestory to provide dim light. The epitome of this style is the Great <b>Hypostyle</b> Hall at Karnak, whose largest columns are [...] tall. In later periods, the Egyptians favored a different style of hall, where a low screen wall at the front let in the light. The shadowy halls, whose columns were often shaped to imitate plants such as lotus or papyrus, were symbolic of the mythological marsh that surrounded the primeval mound at the time of creation. The columns could also be equated with the pillars that held up the sky in Egyptian cosmology.|$|E
500|$|Unable {{to address}} the cult image directly, laymen still {{attempted}} to convey their prayers to it. At times they related messages to priests to deliver to the temple deity; at other times they expressed their piety in {{the parts of the}} temple that they could access. Courts, doorways, and <b>hypostyle</b> halls might have spaces designated for public prayer. Sometimes people directed their appeals to the royal colossi, which were believed to act as divine intermediaries. More private areas for devotion were located at the building's outer wall, where large niches served as [...] "chapels of the hearing ear" [...] for individuals to speak to the god.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} mortuary temple, {{which then}} only comprised a small stone chapel possibly {{built by the}} ephemeral Shepseskare, was finished by Nyuserre. Extending over the whole [...] length of the pyramid side, the temple was built of mudbrick and comprised the earliest <b>hypostyle</b> hall of Ancient Egypt, its roof supported by wooden columns. [...] The hall housed a large wooden statue of the deceased king. Nyuserre also built storage rooms {{to the north of}} the hall and, east of it, the [...] "Sanctuary of the Knife" [...] where animals were ritually slaughtered. A column courtyard completed the temple entrance, adorned with two stone columns and 24 wooden ones.|$|E
500|$|Completely {{surrounded}} by dependencies added as the mosque was used over time, the original structure was [...] {{in length and}} [...] wide, and comprised three arcades situated around a courtyard. To the southeast of the courtyard, the original prayer hall was built as a <b>hypostyle</b> hall, five aisles deep. Measuring [...] by , the qibla wall was slightly off the correct angle. The marble columns supporting the four arcades {{that made up the}} prayer hall were reused from sites extant at different times in Egyptian history, from Pharaonic times through Roman rule to Coptic dominance. The different heights of the columns were made level by using bases of varying thickness. The stucco exterior shows influences from Abbasid, Coptic and Byzantine architecture.|$|E
500|$|Although heavily {{influenced}} by architecture from Mesopotamia and Byzantium, the Fatimids introduced or developed unique features such as the four-centred keel arch and the squinch, connecting square interior volumes to the dome. [...] Their mosques followed the <b>hypostyle</b> plan, where a central courtyard was surrounded by arcades with their roofs usually supported by keel arches, initially resting on columns with leafy Corinthian capitals. They typically had features such as portals that protrude from the wall, domes above mihrabs and qiblas, and façade ornamentation with iconographic inscriptions, and stucco decorations. The woodwork of the doors and interiors of the buildings was often finely carved. The Fatimids also made considerable development towards mausoleum building. The mashad, a shrine that commemorates a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, was a characteristic type of Fatimid architecture.|$|E
500|$|Beyond the <b>hypostyle</b> hall {{were one}} or more peristyle courts open to the sky. These open courts, which had {{been a part of}} Egyptian temple design since the Old Kingdom, became {{transitional}} areas in the standard plan of the New Kingdom, lying between the public space outside the temple and the more restricted areas within. Here the public met with the priests and assembled during festivals. At the front of each court was usually a pylon, a pair of broad, flat towers flanking the main gateway. The pylon is known from only scattered examples in the Old and Middle Kingdoms, but in the New it quickly became the distinctive and imposing façade common to most Egyptian temples. The pylon served symbolically as a guard tower against the forces of disorder and may also have been meant to resemble the hieroglyph for [...] "horizon", underscoring the temple's solar symbolism.|$|E
500|$|The {{plan and}} {{decoration}} of Fatimid mosques reflect Shiite doctrine {{and that the}} mosques were often used for royal ceremonial purposes. [...] The characteristic architectural styles of Fatimid mosques include portals that protrude from the wall, domes above mihrabs and qiblas, porches and arcades with keel-shaped arches supported {{by a series of}} columns, façade ornamentation with iconographic inscriptions and stucco decorations. The mosques followed the <b>hypostyle</b> plan, where a central courtyard was surrounded by arcades with their roofs usually supported by keel arches, initially resting on columns with Corinthian capitals. The arches held inscription bands, a style that is unique to Fatimid architecture. [...] The later columns often had a bell-shaped capital with the same shape mirrored to form the base. The prayer niche was architecturally more elaborate, with features such as a dome or transept. The Fatimid architects built modified versions of Coptic keel-arched niches with radiating fluted hoods, and later extended the concept to fluted domes. The woodwork of the doors and interiors of the buildings was often finely carved.|$|E
500|$|Like all ancient Egyptian architecture, Egyptian temple designs {{emphasized}} order, symmetry, and monumentality {{and combined}} geometric shapes with stylized organic motifs. Elements of temple design also {{alluded to the}} form of the earliest Egyptian buildings. Cavetto cornices at the tops of walls, for instance, were made to imitate rows of palm fronds placed atop archaic walls, and the batter of exterior walls, while partly meant to ensure stability, was also a holdover from archaic building methods. Temple ground plans usually centered on an axis running on a slight incline from the sanctuary down to the temple entrance. In the fully developed pattern used in the New Kingdom and later, the path used for festival processions—a broad avenue punctuated with large doors—served as this central axis. The path was intended primarily for the god's use when it traveled outside the sanctuary; on most occasions people used smaller side doors. The typical parts of a temple, such as column-filled <b>hypostyle</b> halls, open peristyle courts, and towering entrance pylons, were arranged along this path in a traditional but flexible order. Beyond the temple building proper, the outer walls enclosed numerous satellite buildings. [...] The entire area enclosed by these walls is sometimes called the temenos, the sacred precinct dedicated to the god.|$|E
