This is {{a reference to the}} New Statesman, and {{in the context of the}} period would have instantly signalled the pair's political preference to the audience.

60|$|They {{went to the}} {{withdrawing}} apartment accordingly, {{where the}} Countess playfully stretched herself upon the pile of Moorish cushions, half sitting, half reclining, half wrapt in her own thoughts, <b>half</b> <b>listening</b> to the prattle of her attendant.|$|E
60|$|Carol but <b>half</b> <b>listened</b> to the names. She {{could not}} fancy their ever {{becoming}} important to her.|$|R
60|$|Calthea's eyes brightened, {{and with}} a smile she <b>half</b> <b>listened</b> to {{something}} Lanigan Beam was saying to her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I {{might only}} have stayed at home--even if I {{did not go}} to the wedding,' sighed Nuttie, who had only <b>half</b> <b>listened</b> to the Canoness's wisdom.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} into his face. So intent had she been on what she had meant {{to tell him that}} she did not until now {{perceive}} he was preoccupied, and only <b>half</b> <b>listening</b> to what she was saying.|$|E
60|$|As I {{think of}} myself and all these glowing secrecies and hidden fancies within, walking along beside old Siddons, and <b>half</b> <b>listening</b> to his {{instructive}} discourse, I see myself as though I was an image of all humanity under tuition for the social life.|$|E
60|$|But {{the words}} of her comforters had their effect, as no doubt {{was the case with}} Job. She had complained to no one, but {{everybody}} had seen her condition. Her poor dear old mother, who would have put up with a very moderate amount of good usage on the part of such a lover as Sir Francis, had been aware that things were not as they should be. Her three friends, to whom she had not opened her mouth in the way of expressing her grievance, had all seen her trouble. That Maude Hippesley and Miss Altifiorla had noticed it did not strike her with much surprise, but that Mrs. Green should have expressed herself so boldly was startling. She could not but turn the matter over in her own mind and ask herself whether she were ill-treated. And it was not only those differences which the ladies noticed which struck her as ominous, but a certain way which Sir Francis had when talking to herself which troubled her. That light tone of contempt if begun now would certainly not be dropped after their marriage. He had assumed an easy way of almost laughing at her, of quizzing her pursuits, and, worse still, of only <b>half</b> <b>listening</b> to her, which she felt to promise very badly for her future happiness. If he wanted his liberty he should have it,--now and then. She would never be a drag on her husband's happiness. She had resolved from the very first not to be an exigeant wife. She would care for all his cares, but she would never be a troublesome wife. All that had been matter of deep thought to her. And if he were not given to literary tastes in earnest,--for in the first days of their love-making there had been, as was natural, a little pretence,--she would not harass him by her pursuits. And she would sympathise with his racing and his shooting. And she would interest herself, if possible, about Newmarket,--as to which place she found he had a taste. And, joined to all the rest, there came a conviction that his real tastes did take that direction. She had never before heard that he had a passion for the turf; but if it should turn out that he was a gambler! Had any of her friends mentioned such an idea to her a week ago, how she would have rebuked that friend! But now she added this to her other grievances, and began to tell herself that she had become engaged to a man whom she did not know and whom she already doubted.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Ollnee {{still wore}} {{the look of}} one who but <b>half</b> <b>listens</b> to what is said, and Mrs. Joyce slyly touched her hand with {{the tips of her}} fingers. [...] "Do {{you want to go to}} your room?" [...] she asked.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effect of mood on self-paced study time. Twenty-eight university students voluntarily participated in the experiment. <b>Half</b> of them <b>listened</b> to positive music and the other <b>half</b> <b>listened</b> to negative music for nine minutes. After self-assessment of mood, they made self-paced study for word-pairs. The results showed that negative and positive mood have not significant effect on self-paced study time...|$|R
40|$|Sixty-three {{participants}} {{listened to}} an audio· tape {{asking them to}} imagine themselves in God 2 ̆ 7 s presence. <b>Half</b> the participants <b>listened</b> to a script in which God was presented as female and <b>half</b> <b>listened</b> to a script in which God was presented as male. Half of those in each group listened to a male narrator and the other <b>half</b> <b>listened</b> to a female narrator. Before and after listening to the script, participants rated the attributes of God on a forced-choice questionnaire. Those to whom God was presented as female {{were more likely to}} emphasize God 2 ̆ 7 s mercy at posttest whereas those to whom God was presented as male were more likely to endorse God 2 ̆ 7 s power. Those hearing a male voice describe a female God and those hearing a female voice describe a male God reported enjoying the experiment and the audiotape more than those hearing a narrator describing a God of the same gender. Implications are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The Adam Carolla Show {{started as}} a regular weekday podcast in March 2009 and by March 2011, 59.6 million podcasts had been downloaded, {{breaking}} Ricky Gervais previous world record.

5000|$|In Terry Pratchett's Discworld {{series of}} novels, the term 'hedge wizard' {{is used to}} {{describe}} a wizard who specializes in the magical properties of plants. Although this does fit {{with the idea of}} a more rural wizard, given Pratchett's humorous proclivities it is likely here to be a deliberate pun on the word 'hedge'. For example, it is narrated: [...] "If you invited a hedge wizard to a party he would spend half the evening talking to your potted plant. And he would spend the other <b>half</b> <b>listening</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Maggie {{took out}} a book, and sitting lower down the trunk began to read Coleridge's [...] "Christabel". Ursula <b>half</b> <b>listened.</b> She was wildly thrilled. Then she saw Anthony coming across the snow, with his confident, {{slightly}} strutting stride. His face looked brown and hard against the snow, smiling {{with a sort of}} tense confidence.|$|R
60|$|Conger <b>half</b> <b>listened.</b> It {{was going}} to be easier than he had thought. Clearly, he would know as soon as the Founder appeared. These people, so {{suspicious}} of anything different, would be buzzing and gossiping and spreading the story. All {{he had to do was}} lie low and listen, down at the general store, perhaps. Or even here, in Mrs. Appleton's boarding house.|$|R
60|$|It shapes {{itself as}} the most trite and feeble of tragedies, one of those stories of {{effortless}} submission to chance and custom in which Mr. Hardy or George Gissing might have found a theme. I do but <b>half</b> <b>listen</b> at first--watching the black figures in the moonlit roadway pacing to and fro. Yet--I cannot trace how he conveys the subtle conviction to my mind--the woman he loves is beautiful.|$|R
50|$|This story {{takes place}} at the Golden Palm resort on the Caribbean island of St Honoré. Miss Marple's nephew has paid for her to holiday there after a bout of ill health - but she is bored. She is {{approached}} by Major Palgrave, a garrulous man avoided by the other guests due to his long-winded stories. She sits, <b>half</b> <b>listening,</b> until Major Palgrave tells a story about a man who got away with murder more than once. When Palgrave asks her if she wants to see a picture of a murderer, she listens intently - but after he fishes through his wallet for the photo, he suddenly changes the subject. Miss Marple looks up to see why and sees several people nearby.|$|E
50|$|Moat was {{released}} from Durham Prison on 1 July, and allegedly arrived {{in the early hours}} of 3 July 2010 at a house in Birtley where Stobbart and her new partner, 29-year-old karate instructor Chris Brown, were visiting. Brown had moved to the area from Windsor, Berkshire around six months previously. According to Moat, he crouched under the open window of the living room for an hour and a <b>half,</b> <b>listening</b> to Stobbart and Brown mocking him. At 2:40 am, Brown left the house to confront Moat but was shot at close range with a shotgun, and killed. Moat then fired through the living room window while Stobbart's mother was on the phone to the police. Stobbart was hit in the arm and abdomen, and was taken to hospital to undergo a liver operation and put under armed guard.|$|E
40|$|Translation begins] Thursday My Darling, Hope {{that this}} doesn’t get too blurred. But I just washed {{my hair and}} it’s {{dripping}} all over the place. Your letter came that you wrote last Sunday. Golly, honey, I hope March 11 th isn’t rainy too. My hair will look horid [sic] if it does. Right now I’m <b>half</b> <b>listening</b> to Suspense- very confusing. I always pick the nicest atmosphere to write to you, honey- very romantic! I guess that the train is just as slow as the bus, honey. We’ll stay in Atlanta Thursday night probably. So it’s hard to get hotel rooms, huh, honey? Well- that’s a minor detail, we can always find a nice park bench someplace. Honey, that’s the way I always wear my hair- parted {{on the side and}} flat on top- [?] when you were home, that’s the only time I changed it. Everyone else likes it this way, honey. Listen, Judson Clark- will you please answer my question about the Scotch? First- how many bottles {{do you want me to}} buy? And which is better- Pinch bottle or Johnny Walker? You’ve been avoiding my question about Steve. Is there anything wrong between you and sweetie? You never mention him? I’ve been asking and asking you if he was going to be able to arrive by two and if he was very far away. Those are the only two questions that I can think of off hand but if you don’t answer me so help me there’ll be a private war. Especially about the Scotch. Where are the other places that are more convenient? We should go to Mexico or someplace on the way. Of course Mexico is probably millions of miles away. But, how long will we be able to stay wherever we go? You said you wanted to go swimming but I don’t know. If we don’t have more than four or five days it wouldn’t make much difference to me- Remember? Yes, I guess I want you to be boss- I don’t know whether you will be or not. I’ve got a pretty strong mind of my own- All right so you’ll be an officer. There are plenty of other officers- and and [sic] you’ll take orders when necessary! So I’ll be a Colonel! I’m glad that you’re getting the rings. I’d never get it done. Never have time to look. If you like them, honey, I’m sure I will- You have such good taste. You’ll always have to buy my jewelry. Well, I wasn’t exactly trying to discourage you, honey, just sorta preparing you and letting you know what you’re getting in for. But, honey, we’ve got to eat. Golly, I just hate to think of what’s going to happen. You’re going to be awfully hungry. I hope after we’ve been married a while you still feel the same way. I’m not worrying at all about it but everyone else is- All you hear is “Poor Juddie”- Everyone is sure that I’m going to starve you to death or something horrible. Probably kill you from cooking- I’m definitely not the domestic type. Which is the best Johnny Walker, red or black? Well, honey all the articles I’ve read in magazines say that religion is terribly important and since we’re not religious, honey, I was wondering what would happen. I’m not worrying about it at all. I just thought you might like to worry about it. Everyone else seems to think things like that are important. Golly, honey, when we get married it will be the first time I’ve been in a church all this year! That’s awful. Yes, honey, I’m sure it will work out fine- But the experts all disagree. We’ll show them. Well, you see, I read anything that comes along + lately they’re publishing lots of stuff on war marriages and what makes them last + not last. I agree about the only way we can find out if it will work is by trying it. I’m not worried in the least but I want you to be sure that you’ve considered all angles. What a waste of time! Why can’t March hurry. Gee, honey, the way time drags you’d thing we had all year or something. Oh, happy day- (day after Valentine’s day but we got paid today. Tomorrow at noon I’ll take my huge check over to the bank. Hope they have enough money to cover it. (Is that what they do with checks?) Someone’s singing “There Goes That Song Again”. Gee, I miss you so, honey. Golly the time’s getting shorter. Only 24 more days now and we’ll be married, honey. As you’ve probably gathered by now I’m in a very wacky mood and if this letter makes sense it’s purely coincidental. Remember that night at Split Rock when you were getting decoldized- (new word!) Woody and Steve were ready to murder me- I always get wacky at the most inappropriate times. Golly, hone in eleven more days I’ll be all finished working. That’s eleven weekdays. Weekends don’t count. There are times when I dislike everything about that place but then other times I don’t mind it at all. I still feel real patriotic and everything. I don’t know whether I’ll be able to go back to modeling again. It’s so unessential. “To Have And Have Not” is at the movies this weekend. I can hardly wait to see it. Lauren Bacall is in it. I like her a lot. Won’t be able to see it until Monday night though. Tomorrow night I’m not going out. I’ll be a good little girl and write to you for a change. Forgot to buy some envelopes again. Oh well, maybe tomorrow I’ll remember. Gee, honey, I wish these 24 days would hurry. Have you found out about when the graduation dance will be? Can you get Charlotte a date? I should carry a pad + pencil around with me always so that when I think of something to ask you I could write it down and then remember- whenever I begin to write, always forget. Let’s see honey, what else was there that I wanted to ask you. Oh, how many hours have you flown now? Are ya still ahead of everyone? Are you still highest in your class or don’t you know? Gee, in about 14 more days you should know what you’re going to be. That’s 10 days before graduation. I’ll probably have pneumonia if I don’t dry my hair soon. It’s still all wet. Gee, honey, it will be so queer to be married. Since I’ve never been married before, I think it will be queer anyway. But being married to you will be wonderful, darling. Last Sunday seems months away. This week went so fast in a way but in another way it seems as if it had been going on forever. Oh, tomorrow’s Friday- I like Fridays. Honey, will we go on our honeymoon right after we’re married or what? Do you get the 15 days right away. No, don’t tell me that. But where are we going? Let’s not go where it’s rainy- that would be very wetish and – wait a minute- that wouldn’t be so bad- It would be very romantic. Remember that day we walked in the rain, honey. That sure was a long time ago. Well, my darling, I guess I’d better dry my hair and take a bath and get to bed. I love you more than anything else in the world. You’re so sweet, honey, how can anyone be so wonderful. Well, honey, until we’re together again, I’ll love you, Always, Dottie P. S. Please answer my questions!!! [Translation ends...|$|E

He could not have put it into words, but he {{perceived}} the painful truth.

She was a smiling, careless hypocrite.|$|R
60|$|These talks didn't mean {{as much to}} Bradley as {{they should}} have done. He was usually at work at {{something}} and only <b>half</b> <b>listened</b> while the Judge wandered on, his heels in the air, his cheek full of tobacco. Old Colonel Peavy dropped in occasionally, and Dr. Carver, and then the air was full of good, old-time Democratic phrases. At such times the Judge {{even went so far}} as to quote Calhoun.|$|R
60|$|All was right, however; Ermine's {{taste for}} the fitness of things had trained Rose into keeping the little parlour never in stiff array, but also never in a state to be ashamed of, and she herself {{was sitting in the}} shade in the garden, whither, after the first introduction, Colin and Rose brought seats; and the call, on the whole, went off {{extremely}} well. Ermine naver let any one be condescending to her, and conducted the conversation with her usual graceful good breeding, while the colonel, with Rose on his knee, half talked to the child, <b>half</b> <b>listened</b> and watched.|$|R

He comes promptly to the table between them.|$|R
60|$|To {{the eyes}} and ears of Nedda that evening at dinner, all was new indeed, and all wonderful. It was not that she was unaccustomed to society or to conversation, for to their house at Hampstead many people came, uttering many words, but both {{the people and the}} words were so very different. After the first blush, the first {{reconnaissance}} of the two Bigwigs between whom she sat, her eyes WOULD stray and her ears would only <b>half</b> <b>listen</b> to them. Indeed, half her ears, she soon found out, were quite enough to deal with Colonel Martlett and Sir John Fanfar. Across the azaleas she let her glance come now and again to anchor on her father's face, and exchanged with him a most enjoyable blink. She tried once or twice to get through to Alan, but he was always eating; he looked very like a young Uncle Stanley this evening.|$|R
