50|$|The crested serpent eagle (Spilornis cheela) is a {{medium-sized}} {{bird of prey}} that is found in forested habitats across tropical Asia. Within its widespread range across the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia and East Asia, there are considerable variations and some authorities prefer to treat several of its subspecies as completely separate species. In the past, several species including the Philippine serpent <b>eagle</b> (<b>S.</b> holospila), Andaman serpent <b>eagle</b> (<b>S.</b> elgini) and South Nicobar serpent <b>eagle</b> (<b>S.</b> klossi) were treated as subspecies of the Crested serpent eagle. All members within the species complex have a large looking head with long feathers {{on the back of}} the head giving them a maned and crested appearance. The face is bare and yellow joining up with the ceres while the powerful feet are unfeathered and heavily scaled. They fly over the forest canopy on broad wings and tail have wide white and black bars. They call often with a loud, piercing and familiar three or two-note call. They often feed on snakes, giving them their name and are placed along with the Circaetus snake-eagles in the subfamily Circaetinae.|$|E
5000|$|At one time, the Stephanoaetus genus was {{considered}} a [...] "specialized offshoot" [...] of the Spizaetus hawk-eagles based on morphological attributes. DNA sequences utilizing one mitochondrial and three nuclear genes indicated the crowned eagle is a sister species to the Asian hawk-eagles, which are now considered a separate genus, Nisaetus, that are not {{closely related to the}} neotropical hawk-eagles, which are retained in Spizaetus. However, another recent study, this time of sequences of two mitochondrial and one nuclear genes, did not reveal a close relationship of this eagle to any other accipitrid, including the Nisaetus species, and the genus was found to be genetically highly divergent from other [...] "booted" [...] eagles". In a case of convergent evolution, the much heavier harpy eagle, which is outside of the [...] "booted eagle" [...] group, has a similar skeletal morphology to the crowned eagle. Two less well-known, probably distantly related species, the mountain hawk-eagle (Nisaetus nipalensis) and the black-and-chestnut eagle (Spizaetus isidori), have also been found comparable to the crowned eagle. While both are slimmer and smaller, these eagles are also large-bodied, strong-footed offshoots of the evolutionary radiation of forest-dwelling booted eagles, respectively distributed in East Asia and South America. The adult crowned eagle even has somewhat intermediate appearance between these birds, sharing the variable patterning of the mountain hawk-eagle and some of the colouring of the black-and-chestnut. Until possibly up to 1500, another crowned eagle species, the Malagasy crowned <b>eagle</b> (<b>S.</b> mahery) existed. Similar in size and form to the extant crowned eagle, the Malagasy crowned eagle probably filled a similar niche in Madagascar, but was likely to have preyed on lemurs in place of monkeys. Apparently, the Malagasy crowned eagle became extinct due mainly to the loss of prey and habitat change, attributable to early humans on the island. To date, the living crowned eagle has no recognized subspecies. However, Simon Thomsett noted from field experience possible racial differences between crowned eagles in limited woodland habitats in East and South Africa (called by him the [...] "bush eagles"), which have historically been the main populations studied, and those that live in denser West African rainforest, in {{the central part of the}} species distribution. The latter population, he noted, appeared smaller but relatively larger footed, seemed chestier in build and appeared to have deeper eyebrows than the bush eagle; behaviorally the rainforest eagles seemed bolder and louder, which is reinforced in other accounts of the species.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this essay is the medieval castle present in Juliusz Siowacki’s {{literary}} works. I am interested {{in the ways of}} its presentation, attempting to recall the climate of antiquity and the evolution of the picture of the castle. Therefore, I discuss the image of the castle created in the early works: the poetic novel Hugo (1829), the drama Mindowe (1832), {{as well as in the}} later works belonging to the so called mystical period: Wallenrod and Konrad Wallenrod. Helsztyński lies beyond the scope of my interests as its research requires a different perspective. I present in Hugo a stereotypical model of forming architectural space Słowacki draws a very sketchy picture of the castle. He leads the reader into the interiors of a pagan temple and a representative hall with only one decorative element: famous pseudo-classical pillars. The picture of the castle is considerably enriched in Mindowe. First of all, the author enlarges its space. He adds a secret passage and furniture, mentions a treasury and a representative hall. This way he slightly violates the stereotype of an interior subordinated to the tragedy convention. Moreover, I emphasize here the way Słowacki compares the Gothic style to the creations of nature e. g. a hall with pillars is compared to a forest, rose windows to stars, a castle to an <b>eagle</b> <b>s</b> nest. These comparisons tend to illustrate the architectural style - the Gothic and the atmosphere of Middle Ages. This essay shows that the picture of the castle was conceived in opposition to Mickiewicz’s castle presented in Grażyna and Konrad Wallenrod. The image of the castle in Wallenrod and Konrad Wallenrod varie from the early works. However, the fragmentation of these texts precludes any profound analysis of the problem The poet in Wallenrod associates architectural space with characters' personality: Wallenrod - gloomy Malbork, vindictive Jagiełło - bloody Vilnius, Kiejstut and noble Witold - sunny Troki. In the drama Wallenrod the characters’ “interiors” are somehow reflected in the interiors of the castle. The castle is given different significance in the fragments of Konrad Wallenrod, where it becomes the place of recognition of God’s truths. The pictures of Lithuanian castles is created mainly by stereotypes and poetic imagination hardly ever by descriptions of existing buildings. Słowacki did not manage to show the specific type of the castle in Troki in Hugo, although he was personally acquainted with the castle. The image of the castle in Nowogrodek was influenced by the tragedy convention and Mickiewicz’s castle in Grażyna. In the later texts the poet lost his interests in architectural details. He focused on the character’s inside, or as in Konrad Wallenrod, on the importance of the word spoken by the prophet.
