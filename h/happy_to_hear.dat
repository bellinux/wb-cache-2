500|$|McCartney {{summarised}} {{the importance}} of Epstein when he was interviewed in 1997 for a BBC documentary about Epstein, saying, [...] "If anyone was the Fifth Beatle, it was Brian". In his 1970 Rolling Stone interview, Lennon commented that Epstein's death {{marked the beginning of}} the end for the group: [...] "I knew that we were in trouble then... I thought, 'We've had it now'". Thirty years after Epstein's death, McCartney said, [...] "Brian would really be <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> how much we loved him". The first contract between the Beatles and Epstein was auctioned in London in 2008, fetching £240,000.|$|E
500|$|Mason and Washington {{were friends}} {{for many years}} until they finally broke over their {{differences}} regarding the federal constitution. Peter R. Henriques, in his journal article on their relationship, suggested that Mason cultivated the friendship more than Washington did, as Mason sent many more letters and gifts, and stayed more often at Washington's plantation, though the last can be explained in part as Mount Vernon lay on the road from Gunston Hall to Alexandria. Henriques suggested that as Mason was older, intellectually superior, {{and the owner of}} a flourishing plantation as Washington struggled to establish Mount Vernon, {{it would not have been}} in the future president's character to be close to Mason. Washington had a deep respect for Mason's intellectual abilities, several times asking for his advice, and writing in 1777 when learning that Mason had taken charge of an issue before the General Assembly, [...] "I know of no person better qualified... than Colonel Mason, and shall be very <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> he has taken it in hand".|$|E

2500|$|In June 1925, Smith wrote {{a letter}} that was sent to Henry Earle, a {{resident}} of Wheatley Hills that he disagreed with. Smith responded to the letter and submitted it to the New York Times that detailed that he was <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{that some of the}} objectors in the region were beginning to lighten their view on the Northern State Parkway. Smith outlined that he supported the designs made by the LISPC and engineers. Smith mentioned he did not know who recently stated that the Wheatley Hills residents were going to be taught a [...] "lesson" [...] by the state and mentioned that no one had done so. Smith continued to show his support for the looped parkway system developed for Long Island and that having only one parkway (the Middle Island Parkway) would not be advantageous towards the goal. Earle mentioned in his letter than one cannot see the Atlantic Ocean and the Long Island Sound could not be seen from the proposed alignment and Smith responded that the Manetto Hills would go to High Hill, where magnificent views of the water could be seen.|$|E

Prior to the release, Benjamin commented: [...] "It's {{going to be a}} surprise for a lot of John Legend fans, because it is a lot more upbeat than John is—than people think John is. I was actually <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it. This is a cool John Legend song." [...] Benjamin has stated that he is making a solo rap album, and that the response to his remixes is part of the motivation for it. In September 2011 it was announced that OutKast was moved to Epic Records following restructuring within Sony Music Entertainment. Epic Records is headed by LA Reid who has worked with Outkast in the past.
