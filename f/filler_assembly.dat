2500|$|As well as {{the close}} {{tolerances}} between parts, the engine's lack of gaskets {{was made possible by}} a unique crankcase ventilation system. On any 2-cylinder boxer engine such as the 2CV's, the volume of the crankcase reduces by the cubic capacity of the engine when the pistons move together. This, combined with the inevitable small amount of [...] "leakage" [...] of combustion gases past the pistons leads to a positive pressure in the crankcase which must be removed in the interests of engine efficiency and to prevent oil and gas leaks. The 2CV's engine has a combined engine [...] "breather" [...] and oil <b>filler</b> <b>assembly</b> which contains a series of rubber reed valves. These allow positive pressure to escape the crankcase (to the engine air intake to be recirculated) but close when the pressure in the crankcase drops as the pistons move apart. Because gases are expelled but not admitted this creates a slight vacuum in the crankcase so that any weak joint or failed seal causes air to be sucked in rather than allowing oil to leak out.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{powershift}} automated manual transmission, i. e. an automated manual transmission with a torque gap filler, which essentially integrates, in a typical manual transmission layout, a torque gap <b>filler</b> <b>assembly</b> {{with the aim of}} reducing the torque gap that occurs during gearshifts. The torque gap filler consists of an additional mechanical link between the engine and the transmission output shaft, thus enabling the engine power to flow through this parallel path also when the launch clutch is disengaged, with clear benefits in terms of both sportiness and passenger comfort. This paper is the first part of a two-part study which, after a general description of the trans- mission architecture and its working principle, examines a practical implementation of the torque gap filler concept; the additional mechanical components and their integration into a traditional automated manual transmission are presented. Then, kinematic analysis and dynamic analysis of the transmission are proposed. The evolution of the transmission speeds are studied in the whole working range of the vehicle; the equations of motion are derived and used to show the effect of the torque gap filler on the torque transmitted to the wheels and consequently on the vehicle acceleration during gearshifts. The companion paper (Part 2) covers control issues and provides experimental validatio...|$|E
40|$|Introducing {{nanoscale}} fillers into polymer matrices {{has recently}} {{emerged as a}} simple, cost-effective way to enhance the performances of the host materials. A mere capitalization of the filler properties to produce "nano-filled polymers", however, appears rather reductive. An undoubtedly more ambitious goal is the design of "genuine nanocomposites", based on a clever use of nanoparticles to impart new physical characteristics and behaviors that are absent in the unfilled matrix. In the present dissertation, the opportunity of pursuing such an approach to manipulate the phase-separated morphology of immiscible polymer blends is investigated from both a fundamental and a technological point of view. Due to the thermodynamic immiscibility of most polymers, phase separation typically occurs in polymer blending processes, such as melt compounding and solvent casting. The resulting segregated morphologies {{are determined by the}} mutual interactions experienced by the different fluid and solid phases during processing. In {{the first part of the}} study, the physical mechanisms that govern the melt-state microstructural evolutions of polymer blends in the presence of nanoparticles are elucidated through the combination of viscoelastic measurements and morphological analyses. It is highlighted that, when the mobility of the nanoparticles is inhibited due to their anchoring at a polymer/polymer interface, the assembly of the filler is hindered until interface saturation happens. Above this threshold, the same dynamics as in monophasic melts are recovered. Even so, plate-like particles provided with sufficient bending stiffness are found to induce bulk morphological modifications without the need of interfacial jamming. Among others, the stabilization of irregularly-shaped polymer domains and clustering phenomena, which affect the phase inversion of the blend, have been observed. The second part of the study is focused on the formation of films of semi-crystalline polymers through solvent casting. The precipitation and crystallization of the polymers and, eventually, the surface morphology and texture of the resulting flat systems are governed by a complex interplay among wetting, solvent evaporation and, in case of polymer blends, phase separation processes. In addition, all these phenomena are ultimately related to the interactions among the constituents of the starting polymer solution and the casting substrate. Incorporating nanoparticles to the pristine solution significantly affects the evolution of the polymer phases and the final blend morphology, the <b>filler</b> <b>assembly</b> dynamics being in turn influenced by the changing properties of the suspending medium during solvent evaporation. Nanoparticles can induce either a coarsening or a refinement of the phase domains, depending on their state of dispersion in the solution and the structures they form in the course of the casting process. The acquired fundamental knowledge on the nanoparticle-induced morphological modifications in multiphase systems is ultimately capitalized for technologically relevant targets, such as the production of heat-resistant formulations based on recycled plastics and of biodegradable and biocompatible polymer films with prescribed topography and texture...|$|E
40|$|AbstractChitosan (CHI), a {{biocompatible}} and biodegradable polysaccharide {{with the}} ability to provide a non-protein matrix for tissue growth, is considered to be an ideal material in the biomedical field. However, the lack of good mechanical properties limits its applications. In order to overcome this drawback, CHI has been combined with different polymers and fillers, leading to a variety of chitosan-based nanocomposites. The extensive research on CHI nanocomposites as well as their main biomedical applications are reviewed in this paper. An overview of the different <b>fillers</b> and <b>assembly</b> techniques available to produce CHI nanocomposites is presented. Finally, the properties of such nanocomposites are discussed with particular focus on bone regeneration, drug delivery, wound healing and biosensing applications...|$|R
