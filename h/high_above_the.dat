5|$|Just after half-time, Leicester City {{had their}} strongest scoring chance, when Andy Lochhead {{received}} a headed knockdown from Allan Clarke, but Lochhead's shot went <b>high</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> goal. A dominant period by Manchester City then followed, {{which included a}} chance for Colin Bell from a free-kick. Len Glover was forced to move into defence with his team under pressure, but was injured shortly afterward {{and had to be}} substituted. Defender Malcolm Manley came on in his place.|$|E

5|$|After {{passing the}} site of Ty Dwr the railway bends around 'Amen' corner and soon after the Village Incline is reached. From here the line runs into the gorge, <b>high</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> river on a narrow ledge, ending {{at the foot of}} the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The {{original}} line fanned out into a set of three sidings, used to marshal trains of loaded slate wagons coming down from the quarry and empty wagons waiting to ascend. Nant Gwernol station, the eastern terminus of the line, was built on {{the site of}} the sidings.|$|E
5|$|On 28 May 1848 a line opened between Irvine and Busbie, about 2miles (3km) north-west of Kilmarnock; a short {{branch to}} Irvine Harbour {{opened on the}} same day. The Cumnock line as far as Auchinleck and the Muirkirk branch from that point, opened on 9 August. This {{included}} the Ballochmyle Viaduct, located near Catrine; it was built with a central span of 181feet (55.2m) and 175feet (53.3m) <b>high</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> River Ayr. It was the largest masonry arch span {{in the world at}} the time of its completion, and is the highest railway bridge in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Rodgers {{had long}} {{wanted to write}} a musical comedy about the cast and crew {{backstage}} at a theatre. After Rodgers and Hammerstein had another hit with The King and I in 1951, Rodgers proposed the backstage project to his partner. Hammerstein was unenthusiastic, thinking the subject matter trivial, but agreed to do the project. The play required complex machinery, designed by Jo Mielziner, so that the audience could view action not only on the stage of the theatre where the show-within-the-show (also named Me and Juliet) takes place, but in the wings and on the light bridge (<b>high</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> stage, from which the lighting technicians train spotlights) as well.|$|E
5|$|The B-52 {{contributed to}} Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001 (Afghanistan/Southwest Asia), {{providing}} {{the ability to}} loiter <b>high</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> battlefield and provide Close Air Support (CAS) {{through the use of}} precision guided munitions, a mission which previously would have been restricted to fighter and ground attack aircraft. In late 2001, ten B-52s dropped a third of the bomb tonnage in Afghanistan. B-52s also played a role in Operation Iraqi Freedom, which commenced on 20 March 2003 (Iraq/Southwest Asia). On the night of 21 March 2003, B-52Hs launched at least one hundred AGM-86C CALCMs at targets within Iraq.|$|E
5|$|The Commandos on Campbeltown now disembarked: two assault teams, five {{demolition}} {{teams with}} their protectors and a mortar group. Three demolition teams were tasked with destroying the dock pumping machinery and other installations {{associated with the}} dry dock. The kilt-wearing Captain Donald Roy – 'The Laird' – and his 14-man assault troop were tasked with knocking out two pump-house roof-top gun emplacements <b>high</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> quayside and securing a bridge to provide a route for the raiding parties to exit the dock area. Roy and Sgt Don Randall used scaling ladders and grenades to accomplish the former, and a head-on rush to secure the bridge and form a bridgehead that enabled Capt. Bob Montgomery and Lt Corran Purdon and their demolition teams to exit the area.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is set on}} the Wumpa Islands, a {{group of}} three fictional Australian islands owned by Doctor Neo Cortex. Levels are {{typically}} set in tribesmen's villages, fortresses or beaches. Some levels on the second island also take place in temple ruins, bridges <b>high</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> mountains, and a volcanic mine. Levels on the third island feature much more industrial settings, including a large power plant and a castle. The tropical setting of the game was inspired by Donkey Kong Country.|$|E
5|$|The {{illusion}} of endless rows of Klingons {{was created by}} brightly lighting the accused {{in the center of}} the room with a bright blue light, then letting the rest of the set fall into shadow. To give the set a larger appearance, a shot from <b>high</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> courtroom was created using miniatures. Inspired by a scene in Ben-Hur, matte supervisor Craig Barron used two hundred commercially available Worf dolls sent by Ralph Winter. Angry Klingons were created by rocking the dolls back and forth with motors, waving sticks lit by twelve-volt light bulbs dyed red. The resulting courtroom miniature was ten feet long.|$|E
5|$|Both German ships {{initially}} concentrated {{their fire}} on Hood and destroyed her with salvoes of 8- and 15-inch shells. An 8-inch shell hit the boat deck and struck a ready service locker for the UP rocket projectors, and a fire blazed <b>high</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> first superstructure deck. At 05:58 {{at a range}} of , the force commander ordered a turn of 20 degrees to port to open the range and bring the full battery of the British ships to bear on Bismarck. As the turn began, Bismarck straddled Hood with her third and fourth four-gun salvoes and at 06:01 the fifth salvo hit her, causing a large explosion. Flames shot up near Hoods masts, then an orange-coloured fireball and an enormous smoke cloud obliterated the ship. On Prince of Wales, it seemed that Hood collapsed amidships, and the bow and stern could be seen rising as she rapidly settled. Prince of Wales made a sharp starboard turn to avoid hitting the debris {{and in doing so}} further closed the range between her and the German ships. In the four-minute action, Hood, the largest battlecruiser in the world, had been sunk. 1,419 officers and men were killed. Only three men survived.|$|E

5|$|Jean-Michel Jarre {{was born}} in Lyon on 24 August 1948, to France Pejot, a French Resistance member and {{concentration}} camp survivor, and composer Maurice Jarre. When Jarre was five, his parents split up and his father moved to America, leaving him with his mother. He did not see his father again until reaching the age of 18. For the first eight years of his life, Jarre spent six months each year at his maternal grandparents' flat on the Cours de Verdun, in the Perrache district of Lyon. Jarre's grandfather was an oboe player, engineer and inventor, designing an early audio mixer used at Radio Lyon. He also gave Jean-Michel his first record player. From his vantage point <b>high</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> pavement, the young French boy was able to watch street performers at work, an experience he later cited as proving influential on his art.|$|E
5|$|Just {{north of}} the {{community}} of Hale the road enters the Huron National Forest near Loon Lake. The trunkline takes a turn to the east as it passes along the Au Sable River. The River Road National Scenic Byway starts on M-65 at Rollways Road, and the highway generally follows the river as it passes by a former logging community which is commemorated by Lumberman's Monument. At the intersection with River Road, M-65 turns north to cross the Au Sable, and the byway designation continues east along River Road to follow the river to Oscoda. The M-65 bridge over the Au Sable is just downstream of the Five Channels Dam, crossing <b>high</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> water below. The highway turns northwesterly through forest land to cross into Alcona County. North of the county line, the trunkline follows Baker and State roads near Vaughn and Hunters lakes. M-65 meets the western terminus of county road F-30 in the community of Glennie. The highway also crosses the South Branch of the Pine River.|$|E
5|$|One {{thousand}} {{years before the}} events in the game, on a floating continent hovering <b>high</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> surface of an unnamed planet, a technologically advanced civilization sought to harness the power of the four elemental crystals of light. They did not realize that they could not control such fundamental forces of nature. This power of light would have consumed the world itself had the light crystals not had their natural counterparts: the four dark elemental crystals. Disturbed by the sudden interruption of the careful balance between light and dark, four warriors were granted the power of the dark crystals to recapture the power of the light crystals. These so-called Dark Warriors succeeded in their quest, and restored harmony to the world. But their victory came too late to save the doomed civilization, whose culture was reduced to ruin, though their floating continent remained. On that continent, the circle of Gulgans, a race of blind soothsayers and fortune-tellers, predicted that these events will ultimately repeat.|$|E
50|$|The crab claw {{characteristically}} widens upwards, {{putting more}} sail area <b>higher</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> ocean, {{where the wind}} is stronger and steadier. This increases the heeling moment: the sails tend to blow the watercraft over. For this reason, crabclaws are typically used on multihulls, which resist heeling more strongly.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} rhyodacites (or rhyodacitic tuffs) {{have been}} metamorphosed to fine-grained leptynites. Stratigraphically they usually follow after the basal calcareous marbles, but occasionally {{they can be}} found somewhat <b>higher</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> calcareous marbles. Radiometric age dating on these rhyodacites yielded 581 million years supporting the Ediacarian age of the Canaveilles Group.|$|R

5|$|Scientist Hector Hammond is {{summoned by}} his father, Senator Robert Hammond, {{to a secret}} {{government}} facility to perform an autopsy on Abin Sur's body {{under the watchful eye}} of Amanda Waller. A piece of Parallax inside the corpse enters Hammond, giving him telepathic and telekinetic powers at the cost of his sanity. After discovering that he was chosen for the secret work only due to his father's influence, Hammond attempts to kill his father by telekinetically sabotaging his helicopter at a party. Jordan saves the senator and the party guests, including his childhood sweetheart Carol Ferris. Back at the government facility, Hammond uses telekenisis to successfully kill his father by burning him alive. Hammond also elevates Waller <b>high</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> floor. As she's falling, Jordan arrives and saves the injured Waller by creating a pool of water which whisks her away out of further danger. During the encounter Jordan learns of Parallax coming to Earth.|$|E
5|$|The Santa Fe {{introduced}} the El Capitan in 1938. The train {{ran on the}} Santa Fe's main line between Chicago and Los Angeles. Unusually for streamliners of the period, the El Capitan carried coaches only, and had no sleeping cars. Passengers flocked to the new train, and the Santa Fe added cars to meet the demand. The train grew from five cars in 1938 to fourteen in 1952. Sometimes demand was high enough to justify running a second instance ("section") of the train on the same day. The Santa Fe sought a solution to increase {{the capacity of the}} train without lengthening it further. Two popular innovations by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB) suggested a solution. First, in 1945, the CB {{introduced the}} first dome car, in which passengers rode on a second level <b>high</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> tracks, affording better views. Second, in 1950, it placed bilevel rail cars in commuter service in the Chicago area. Taken together, these innovations suggested a new possibility: a long-distance bilevel coach, with greater capacity than single-level cars, and the panoramic views of a dome.|$|E
5|$|Around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, using as the prototype for the three-arched bridge spanning the Avon an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Thus, Pulteney Bridge became {{not just a}} means of crossing the river, but also a shopping arcade. Along with the Rialto Bridge and the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, which it resembles, {{it is one of}} the very few surviving bridges in Europe to serve this dual purpose. It has been substantially altered since it was built. The bridge was named after Frances and William Pulteney, the owners of the Bathwick estate for which the bridge provided a link to the rest of Bath. The Georgian streets in the vicinity of the river tended to be built <b>high</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> original ground level to avoid flooding, with the carriageways supported on vaults extending in front of the houses. This can be seen in the multi-storey cellars around Laura Place South of Pulteney Bridge, in the colonnades below Grand Parade, and in the grated coal holes in the pavement of North Parade. In some parts of the city, such as George Street, and London Road near Cleveland Bridge, the developers of the opposite side of the road did not match this pattern, leaving raised pavements with the ends of the vaults exposed to a lower street below.|$|E
