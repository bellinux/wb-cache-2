25|$|Spearman's {{argument}} {{proposing a}} general factor of human intelligence is still accepted in principle by many psychometricians. Today's factor models of intelligence typically represent cognitive abilities as a three-level hierarchy, {{where there are}} {{a large number of}} narrow factors {{at the bottom of the}} hierarchy, a handful of broad, more general factors at the intermediate level, and at the apex a single factor, referred to as the g factor, which represents the variance common to all cognitive tasks. However, this view is not universally accepted; other <b>factor</b> <b>analyses</b> of the data, with different results, are possible. Some psychometricians regard g as a statistical artifact.|$|E
2500|$|Like all Big Five {{personality}} traits, {{the roots}} of the modern concept of agreeableness can be traced to a 1936 study by Gordon Allport and Henry S. Odbert. Seven years later, Raymond Cattell published a cluster analysis of the thousands of personality-related words identified by Allport and Odbert. The clusters identified in this study served as a foundation for Cattell's further attempts to identify fundamental, universal, human personality factors. He eventually settled on 16 personality factors through the use of factor analysis. Further <b>factor</b> <b>analyses</b> revealed five higher-order, or [...] "global", factors to encompass these 16. Although labelled [...] "independence" [...] by Cattell, a global factor defined by high scores on the E, H, L, and Q1 factors of the 16PF Questionnaire was an early precursor to the modern concept of agreeableness.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} results of a major survey into the {{determinants}} of bus driver performance. Over 600 drivers in the Scottish Bus Group were given a battery of three psychological tests: (i) the Ingleton Word Recognition Test, (ii) the IPAT Culture Fair test of "g" and (iii) the Cattell 16 PF. Scores on these were <b>factor</b> <b>analysed</b> along with age to give six second-order factors. Over forty measures of work performance were also collected for each driver; these were <b>factor</b> <b>analysed</b> and six <b>factors</b> emerged. Factor scores from the two analyses were correlated and the main dimensions of personality and performance determined. The thesis also presents a review of the history and structure of the British bus industry, and of the role and duties of the bus driver. Methodological issues in the research also receive detailed discussion. The results have already started to be applied in the selection of new drivers by the Scottish Bus Group...|$|R

5000|$|Self-monitoring, {{despite all}} the {{research}} and theory behind it, has been shrouded with controversy and confusion with respect to its actual existence. The initial confusion was caused because there was <b>factor</b> <b>analyses</b> conducted, revealing that the structure of most items of the Self-Monitoring Scale was multifactorial. There are three factors that appeared necessary {{to account for the}} correlations between the items for the measure, interpreted as Acting (e.g. [...] "I would probably make a good actor"), Extraversion (e.g. [...] "In a group of people, I am rarely the center of attention") and Other-Directedness (e.g. [...] "I guess I put on a show to entertain or impress other people") (Snyder, M. & Gangestad, S. (2000)). Though these <b>factor</b> <b>analyses</b> are used as instruments to measure the level of self monitoring, they have prompted the question of the existence of self-monitoring, that is, is it a real, unitary phenomenon. Mark Snyder and Steven W. Gangestad, (2000) argued through a series of quantitative experiments that it is indeed a real unitary phenomenon by showing that external criterion measures representing a wide array of phenomena relating to expressive control all point to self-monitoring as a real causal phenomena.|$|E
