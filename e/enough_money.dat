5|$|This is a {{city that}} doesn't have <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> for basic {{services}} right now and doesn't have <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to protect regular citizens. The question has to be asked whether a full-time bodyguard detail to one alderman who hasn't {{been shown to be}} in any kind of danger {{for more than two decades}} is warranted.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, after Laliberté re-privatized Cirque du Soleil, it {{was invited}} to perform at the Los Angeles Arts Festival. Although they {{continued}} to be plagued by financial difficulties, Normand Latourelle took the gamble and went to Los Angeles, despite only having <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to make a one-way trip. Had the show been a failure, the company {{would not have had}} <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to get their performers and equipment back to Montreal.|$|E
5|$|A {{school was}} built in Vietnam in memory of Pryce. His colleagues raised <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to have the school built to leave a lasting legacy in his honour. The primary school opened in 2007. Its cost was met by the Hong Kong office of Pryce's employer, Linklaters.|$|E

"By {{proving to}} the whole neighborhood, Mr. Armadale, what I firmly {{believe to be the}} truth--that the pet object of the public {{protection}} is an adventuress of the worst class; an undeniably worthless and dangerous woman.

5|$|White {{kept his}} job with Short Brothers and {{wrote in the}} evenings, as his stories did not make <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> for {{him to become a}} {{full-time}} author. In 1980 he taught a literature course at a Belfast branch of the Workers Educational Association.|$|E
5|$|By 1986, {{the company}} was once again in serious {{financial}} trouble. During 1985 they had taken the show outside Quebec to a lukewarm response. In Toronto they performed {{in front of a}} 25% capacity crowd after not having <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to properly market the show. Gilles Ste-Croix, dressed in a monkey suit, walked through downtown Toronto as a desperate publicity stunt. A later stop in Niagara Falls turned out to be equally problematic.|$|E
5|$|Flashbang Studios {{had planned}} to earn money from {{creating}} casual games {{so that they could}} create a quirky game without having to worry about sales and sustaining the studio. Although the company failed to create a financially successful casual game, by creating software for other companies they managed to acquire <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to undertake an unusual project of their own choosing.|$|E

60|$|It was, of course, quite {{difficult}} to determine just how large a company this should be. If it were composed of too many members, the profits, which would be limited, owing to the peculiar circumstances of the case, would not amount to much for each stockholder. And yet there must be members <b>enough</b> to furnish <b>money</b> <b>enough.</b>|$|R

5|$|His first efforts, {{published}} under {{a variety}} of pseudonyms, were cheaply printed potboiler novels. In 1829 he finally released a novel under his own name, titled Les Chouans; it was a minor success, though it did not earn the author <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to relieve his considerable debt. He found fame soon afterwards with a series of novels including La Physiologie du mariage (1829), Sarrasine (1830), and La Peau de chagrin (1831).|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{the sons}} of Frederick Law Olmsted, {{landscape}} architect for Central Park in New York, Carey and Frederick, Jr. were asked to design the park's master plan while they were at work on Grant Park. The city agreed to pay $1,800 for the plan, but Olmsted was concerned that Atlanta might not have <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> for the necessary improvements.|$|E
5|$|In January 1880, two of Tesla's uncles put {{together}} <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> {{to help him}} leave Gospić for Prague, where he was to study. He arrived too late to enroll at Charles-Ferdinand University; he had never studied Greek, a required subject; and he was illiterate in Czech, another required subject. Tesla did, however, attend lectures in philosophy at the university as an auditor {{and he did not}} receive grades for the courses.|$|E

5|$|In May 2010, the Barr {{campaign}} was sued by libertarian pundit Jim Bovard, {{who was hired}} to ghostwrite {{a book about the}} campaign. Bovard claims he was never paid the $47,000 he was to receive for his efforts. Campaign manager Russ Verney stated that the campaign hoped to raise <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to pay Bovard, and asked for donations. The ensuing litigation resulted in a judgment entered for Bovard against the Bar 2008 Presidential Committee, Inc., in the full amount of $47,000.00.|$|E
5|$|Overall, the Myst {{series has}} been commercially and {{critically}} successful. Rand and Robyn Miller were expecting Myst to {{perform as well}} as previous Cyan titles, making <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to fund the next project. Instead, Myst sold more than six million units, becoming the top-selling PC game of all time until The Sims surpassed its sales in 2002. The first three games in the series have sold more than twelve million copies.|$|E
5|$|Ross felt {{strongly}} that the state should adequately care for its veterans. During his first term, the first Confederate home in Texas was dedicated in Austin. Within two years, the facility {{had run out of}} room, so Ross served as chairman of a committee to finance a relocation to a larger facility. By August 1890, the home had collected <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to move to a larger location.|$|E

5|$|Several factors {{prevented}} {{the company from}} going bankrupt that year. The Desjardins Group, which was Cirque du Soleil's financial institution at the time, covered about $200,000 of bad checks. Also, a financier named Daniel Lamarre, who worked {{for one of the}} largest public relations firms in Quebec, represented the company for free, knowing that they didn't have the money to pay his fee. The Quebec government itself also came through again, granting Laliberté <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to stay solvent for another year.|$|E
5|$|They {{set out on}} {{the road}} with little money in a yellow 1973 Buick Skylark {{convertible}} with a guy named Ben (Anson Mount). Lucy, however, leaves without the permission of her overbearing father Pete (Dan Aykroyd), who wakes up the next day to find his daughter is gone. Shortly into their journey, the car breaks down. They realise that they don't have <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> between them for the travel or the repair costs. Mimi then suggests that she sing karaoke at a local bar, where good singers are tipped well by the customers. While at the bar, the girls dress up and go the stage to perform. However, when the song starts Mimi develops stage fright, being unable to sing. Seeing that they needed the money, Lucy takes her place, and quickly becomes a hit with the crowd. They make <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to fix the car and continue on their way.|$|E
5|$|When {{a tax cut}} {{passed over}} Buckner's veto in 1890drained the state treasury, the {{governor}} loaned the state <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to remain solvent until tax revenue came in. Later that year, he was chosen as a delegate to the state's constitutional convention. In this capacity, he unsuccessfully sought to extend the governor's appointment powers and levy taxes on churches, clubs, and schools that made a profit.|$|E

5|$|After earning <b>enough</b> <b>money,</b> Kertész quickly {{bought his}} first camera (an ICA box camera) in 1912, despite his family's protests to {{continue}} his career in business. In his free time, he photographed the local peasants, gypsies, and landscape of the surrounding Hungarian Plains (the puszta). His first photograph {{is believed to be}} Sleeping Boy, Budapest, 1912. His photographs were first published in 1917 in the magazine Érdekes Újság, during World War I, while Kertész was serving in the Austro-Hungarian army. As early as 1914 (for example, Eugene, 1914), his distinctive and mature style was already evident.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Barkley went to Emory College (now part of Emory University) in Oxford, Georgia, the {{alma mater}} of several administrators {{and faculty members}} at Marvin. During the 1897–1898 {{academic}} year, he {{was active in the}} debating society and the Delta Tau Delta fraternity, but he could not afford to continue his education and returned to Clinton after the spring semester. He took a job teaching at Marvin College but did not make <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to meet his basic living expenses. He resigned in December 1898 to move with his parents to Paducah, Kentucky, the county seat of McCracken County, where his father found employment at a cordage mill.|$|E
