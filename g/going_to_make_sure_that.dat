500|$|After Sonnen's {{win over}} Nate Marquardt in early 2010, Sonnen became a {{polarizing}} figure {{due to his}} criticism of Silva and overall trash talk (including comments directed towards Silva's manager, teammates, coaches, wife and home country of Brazil). Silva remained relatively quiet until a UFC 148 media call in June 2012, when he stated through an interpreter: [...] "Chael Sonnen's {{going to get his}} ass kicked like he's never gotten his ass kicked before. What I'm going to do inside the Octagon is something that's going to change the image of the sport. This is going to be violent and I am sorry. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> every one of his teeth are broken, that his arms are broken and his legs are broken. He's {{not going to be able}} to walk out of the Octagon by himself. I can guarantee that. He will need a plastic surgeon afterwards. And I know that he’s listening, so the game’s over. No more shit talking. It’s on now." [...] This caught some by surprise, who perceived his remarks as out of character.|$|E

2500|$|Heirens {{was given}} an {{institutional}} parole for the Degnan murder in 1965, and in 1966 he was discharged on that case and began serving his second life sentence. Although not freed, parole policies of the day meant that he was considered rehabilitated by prison authorities and that the Degnan case could no longer legally be put forward {{as a reason to}} deny parole. Based on the regulations of 1946, Heirens should have been discharged from the Brown murder in 1975 and from all remaining charges in 1983. However, in 1973 the focus moved from rehabilitation to punishment and deterrence, which blocked moves to release Heirens. In 1983, the Seventh District U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that it was unconstitutional to refuse parole on deterrence grounds to inmates convicted before 1973. Magistrate Gerald Cohn ordered Illinois to release Heirens immediately. The brother and sister of Suzanne Degnan went public, pleading with authorities to fight the ruling. Attorney General Neil Hartigan stated [...] "Only God and Heirens know how many other women he murdered. Now a bleeding-heart do-gooder decides that Heirens is rehabilitated and should go free... I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> kill-crazed animal stays where he is," [...] a sentiment supported by the media. The Illinois Senate passed a resolution that as the [...] "confessed murderer of Suzanne Degnan, a 6-year-old girl whom he strangled in 1946... that it is the opinion of the chamber that the release of William Heirens at this time would be detrimental to {{the best interests of the}} people of the state." [...] With the support of prominent politicians, the 1983 court ruling was later reversed.|$|E
