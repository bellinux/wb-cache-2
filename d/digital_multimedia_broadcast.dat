30|$|There {{are several}} {{standards}} currently used worldwide for digital terrestrial broadcasting [1]. The first introduced was the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC), now used in North America and South Korea. Digital Video Broadcasting - Terrestrial (DVB-T) is the European-based consortium standard, used apart from Europe in Australia, India, {{and some other}} Asian and African countries. The Japanese standard for digital terrestrial television is called Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting - Terrestrial (ISDB-T), adopted after ATSC and DVB-T {{taking into account the}} experience gained with the older standards and it is widely used in South America. Besides those three international standards for digital terrestrial broadcasting, there is also Chinese <b>Digital</b> Terrestrial <b>Multimedia</b> <b>Broadcast</b> standard for fixed and mobile users. Two significant standards for terrestrial mobile TV reception are Terrestrial - <b>Digital</b> <b>Multimedia</b> Broadcasting (T-DMB) and Digital Video Broadcasting - Handheld (DVB-H). The first one was developed in South Korea and its physical parameters are identical to the European Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) standard. T-DMB is being put into use in many countries around the world. On the other side, DVB-H is the preferred technology for terrestrial mobile broadcasting services in Europe.|$|R

It {{is not only the}} number of users that increases but also the average data volume per user; a consequence of the increased number of users connected via broadband techniques is that the demand for audio and video content is also increasing. In this papel we describe an integrated satellite-terrestrial UMTS architecture investigating on the minimization of the delivery cost. The proposed telecommunication system can offer SDMB (Satellite <b>Digital</b> <b>Multimedia</b> <b>Broadcast)</b> services to mobile users through the satellite or terrestrial UMTS downlink segment. On the inside of this scenario we propose a simple and efficient cost model for choosing the more suitable bearer (satellite or terrestrial) in order to save service delivery cost, moreover we design a new signalling strategy based on users location information for supporting this optimal choice. The simulations performed show the goodness of the proposed strategy also with several mobile operator networks varying the number of users asking for the SDMB service...|$|E
30|$|Recently, 3 D (more accurately, stereo 3 D) images/videos, which surely move {{our home}} {{audio-visual}} entertainment towards a greater perceptual realism, {{are attracting more attention}} in applications, such as multimedia, games, TV broadcasting, and augmented reality. With the {{advances in the}} technologies of 3 D content capturing (e.g., dual-eye cameras or time of flight depth camera) and stereoscopic display, the influence of 3 D videos on human beings’ daily life are getting more important. Though many LCD-TV manufacturers are promoting their 3 DTV products to the market from year 2010, the popularity is however limited by the availability of 3 D video content. Though digital 3 DTV broadcasting via Digital Broadcasting Satellite in Japan, 3 D <b>Digital</b> <b>Multimedia</b> <b>Broadcast</b> system in Korea, and Advanced Three-dimensional Television System Technologies, and FP 7 framework program [1] in Europe are currently in operation or under development, the sources of 3 D video content are still not diverse enough. Since professional 3 D video capturing devices are not so popular and normally expensive, the lack of sufficient amount of 3 D video content motivates researchers to convert existing 2 D videos into their stereoscopic versions [2]. With a rapid provision of abundant 3 D video content, a quick progress in consumer electronics industry can thus be ensured.|$|E

The aim of the work reported in this paper is to develop a new multi-view video coding technique suitable for low bitrate applications in terms of coding efficiency, computational and memory complexity, when coding videos, which contain either a single or multiple scenes. The paper proposes a new prediction architecture that addresses deficiencies of prediction architectures for multi-view video coding based on H. 264 /AVC. The prediction architectures which are used in mixed spatial-resolution multi-view video coding (MSR-MVC) are afflicted with significant computational complexity and require significant memory size, with regards to coding time and to the minimum number of reference frames. The architecture proposed herein is based on a set of investigations, which explore the effect of different inter-view prediction directions on the coding efficiency of multi-view video coding, conduct a comparative study of different decimation and interpolation methods, in addition to analyzing block matching statistics. The proposed prediction architecture has been integrated with an adaptive reference frame ordering algorithm, to provide an efficient coding solution for multi-view videos with hard scene changes. The paper includes a comparative performance assessment of the proposed architecture against an extended architecture based on the 3 D <b>digital</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>broadcast</b> (3 D-DMB) and the Hierarchical B-Picture (HBP) architecture, which are two most widely used architectures for MSR-MVC. The assessment experiments show that the proposed architecture needs less bitrate by on average 13.1  Kbps, less coding time by 14 % and less memory consumption by 31.6 %, compared to a corresponding codec, which deploys the extended 3 D-DMB architecture when coding single-scene videos. Furthermore, the codec, which deploys the proposed architecture, accelerates coding by on average 57 % and requires 52 % less memory, compared to a corresponding codec, which uses the HBP architecture. On the other hand, multi-view video coding which uses the proposed architecture needs more bitrate by on average 24.9  Kbps compared to a corresponding codec that uses the HBP architecture. For coding a multi-view video which has hard scene changes, the proposed architecture yields less bitrate (by on average 28.7 to 35.4  Kbps), and accelerates coding time (by on average 64 and 33 %), compared to the HBP and extended 3 D-DMB architectures, respectively. The proposed architecture will thus be most beneficial in low bitrate applications, which require multi-view video coding for video content depicting hard scene changes.|$|E

In this study, a robust algorithm based on DWT for video copyright protection is proposed.

In this algorithm, DWT is performed on both watermark image and video I- frames. Using a multiplicative hiding method, watermark image is embedded in its corresponding frequency coefficients of DWT in video I-frames. Based on experimental results the presented method maintains the high transparency of video stream meanwhile resist the watermark against a variety of attacks like: noisy attacks, filtering attacks, blurring attack and compression attacks...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, we {{introduce}} Irregular Variable Length Coding (IrVLC) {{and investigate}} its applications, characteristics {{and performance in}} the context of <b>digital</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>broadcast</b> telecommunications. During IrVLC encoding, the multimedia signal is represented using a sequence of concatenated binary codewords. These are selected from a codebook, comprising a number of codewords, which, in turn, comprise various numbers of bits. However, during IrVLC encoding, the multimedia signal is decomposed into particular fractions, each of which is represented using a different codebook. This is in contrast to regular Variable Length Coding (VLC), in which the entire multimedia signal is encoded using the same codebook. The application of IrVLCs to joint source and channel coding is investigated {{in the context of}} a video transmission scheme. Our novel video codec represents the video signal using tessellations of Variable-Dimension Vector Quantisation (VDVQ) tiles. These are selected from a codebook, comprising a number of tiles having various dimensions. The selected tessellation of VDVQ tiles is signalled using a corresponding sequence of concatenated codewords from a Variable Length Error Correction (VLEC) codebook. This VLEC codebook represents a specific joint source and channel coding case of VLCs, which facilitates both compression and error correction. However, during video encoding, only particular combinations of the VDVQ tiles will perfectly tessellate, owing to their various dimensions. As a result, only particular sub-sets of the VDVQ codebook and, hence, of the VLEC codebook may be employed to convey particular fractions of the video signal. Therefore, our novel video codec can be said to employ IrVLCs. The employment of IrVLCs to facilitate Unequal Error Protection (UEP) is also demonstrated. This may be applied when various fractions of the source signal have different error sensitivities, as is typical in audio, speech, image and video signals, for example. Here, different VLEC codebooks having appropriately selected error correction capabilities may be employed to encode the particular fractions of the source signal. This approach may be expected to yield a higher reconstruction quality than equal protection in cases where the various fractions of the source signal have different error sensitivities. Finally, this thesis investigates the application of IrVLCs to near-capacity operation using EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart analysis. Here, a number of component VLEC codebooks having different inverted EXIT functions are employed to encode particular fractions of the source symbol frame. We show that the composite inverted IrVLC EXIT function may be obtained as a weighted average of the inverted component VLC EXIT functions. Additionally, EXIT chart matching is employed to shape the inverted IrVLC EXIT function to match the EXIT function of a serially concatenated inner channel code, creating a narrow but still open EXIT chart tunnel. In this way, iterative decoding convergence to an infinitesimally low probability of error is facilitated at near-capacity channel SNRs. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a survey of}} the {{transmission}} techniques used in digital television (TV) standards worldwide. With the increase in the demand for High-Definition (HD) TV, video-on-demand and mobile TV services, there was a real need for more bandwidth-efficient, flawless and crisp video quality, which motivated the migration from analogue to digital broadcasting. In this paper we present a brief history of the development of TV and then we survey the transmission technology used in different digital terrestrial, satellite, cable and mobile TV standards {{in different parts of the}} world. First, we present the Digital Video Broadcasting standards developed in Europe for terrestrial (DVB-T/T 2), for satellite (DVB-S/S 2), for cable (DVB-C) and for hand-held transmission (DVB-H). We then describe the Advanced Television System Committee standards developed in the USA both for terrestrial (ATSC) and for hand-held transmission (ATSC-M/H). We continue by describing the Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting standards developed in Japan for Terrestrial (ISDB-T) and Satellite (ISDB-S) transmission and then present the International System for Digital Television (ISDTV), which was developed in Brazil by adopteding the ISDB-T physical layer architecture. Following the ISDTV, we describe the <b>Digital</b> Terrestrial television <b>Multimedia</b> <b>Broadcast</b> (DTMB) standard developed in China.
