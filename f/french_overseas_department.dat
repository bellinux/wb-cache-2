5|$|Tropical Cyclone Hyacinthe was the wettest {{tropical}} cyclone on record worldwide. The eighth named storm of the season, Hyacinthe formed on January15, 1980, {{to the northeast}} of Mauritius in the southern Indian Ocean. Initially it moved to the west-southwest, and while slowly intensifying it passed north of the <b>French</b> <b>overseas</b> <b>department</b> of Réunion. On January19, Météo-France estimated that the storm had intensified to a {{tropical cyclone}}. Hyacinthe looped {{to the south of}} eastern Madagascar and weakened, although it restrengthened after turning to the east. The storm executed another loop to the southwest of Réunion, passing near the island for a second and later third time. Hyacinthe became extratropical on January29 after turning southward, dissipating two days later.|$|E

25|$|The island {{suffers from}} a {{geographical}} position that exposes it to strong waves with multiple origins. One {{of these is the}} trade winds and above all affects the leeward east coast. Another explanation is the absence of dry land between the south seas and the shores of the Sud sauvage (the southeastern part of the island), which means that the screaming sixties and the furious fifties (terms invented by mariners to describe the powerful winds between those longitudes) can reach Réunion without meeting any obstacle. A third reason is that this <b>French</b> <b>Overseas</b> <b>department</b> lies {{in the path of the}} tropical cyclones that arise in the centre of the Indian Ocean.|$|E
25|$|On 22 February 2007, Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy {{were broken}} {{away from the}} <b>French</b> <b>{{overseas}}</b> <b>department</b> of Guadeloupe to form new overseas collectivities. As a consequence their EU status was unclear for a time.

The legal status of the islands was clarified on the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty which listed them as an outermost region. However, Saint Barthélemy ceased being an outermost region and left the EU, to become an OCT, on 1 January 2012.|$|E

In Malaysia, 543 primary education government schools are available fully in Tamil medium. The establishments of Tamil medium schools have been currently in process in Myanmar to provide education completely in Tamil language by the Tamils who settled there 200 years ago. Tamil is taught in Canada for the local Tamil minority populations and the month of January has been declared [...] "Tamil Heritage Month" [...] by the Parliament of Canada.
