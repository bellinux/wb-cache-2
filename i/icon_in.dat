5|$|Bhikshatana is {{a popular}} <b>icon</b> <b>in</b> South India, in {{contrast}} to North India, where it is of lesser importance. Though Bhikshatana {{does not have any}} temples dedicated to him as the primary deity, he is sculpted in stone temple walls, worshipped as a subsidiary deity, and cast in bronze as a temple festival processional <b>icon</b> <b>in</b> almost every major Tamil Shiva temple. Many Tamil language hymns sing of Bhikshatana's wanderings, often narrating of the pining of the love-smitten who are enamoured of him.|$|E

5|$|According to Nicol, Tagaris was {{probably}} {{born in the}} 1320s, while other sources like the Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium and the Prosopographisches Lexikon der Palaiologenzeit put it later, around the year 1340. His parents arranged his marriage {{at the age of}} 14 or 15, but soon he abandoned his wife and left Constantinople to become a monk in Palestine. After a while he returned to Constantinople, where he quickly became embroiled in scandal: he claimed that an <b>icon</b> <b>in</b> his possession had miraculous properties, and made money out of gullible believers. This affair scandalized his family, but Patriarch Kallistos I declined to take action against him. It was not until the patriarch went on a visit to Serbia in July 1363 that his locum tenens, the hieromonk Dorotheos, confiscated the icon and forced Paul to return to Palestine.|$|E

5|$|According to {{professor}} Nalini Natarajan of the University of Puerto Rico, Nargis's Mother India is a metonymic {{representation of a}} Hindu woman, reflecting high Hindu values, with virtuous morality and motherly self-sacrifice. Film scholar Jyotika Virdi wrote that Mother India could {{also be seen as}} a metaphor of the trinity of mother, God, and a dynamic nation. Vijay Mishra, in his 2002 book Bollywood Cinema: Temples of Desire, opined that the Mother India figure is an <b>icon</b> <b>in</b> several respects—being associated with a goddess, her function as a wife, as a lover, and even compromising her femininity {{at the end of the}} film by playing the role of Vishnu the Preserver and Shiva the Destroyer, masculine gods.|$|E
5|$|Bartholdi and Laboulaye {{considered}} {{how best}} to express the idea of American liberty. In early American history, two female figures were frequently used as cultural symbols of the nation. One of these symbols, the personified Columbia, {{was seen as an}} embodiment of the United States in the manner that Britannia was identified with the United Kingdom and Marianne came to represent France. Columbia had supplanted the earlier figure of an Indian princess, which had come to be regarded as uncivilized and derogatory toward Americans. The other significant female <b>icon</b> <b>in</b> American culture was a representation of Liberty, derived from Libertas, the goddess of freedom widely worshipped in ancient Rome, especially among emancipated slaves. A Liberty figure adorned most American coins of the time, and representations of Liberty appeared in popular and civic art, including Thomas Crawford's Statue of Freedom (1863) atop the dome of the United States Capitol Building.|$|E

In the 1999 American Film Institute's list of AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars, she was ranked as the sixth greatest film star; {{two of the}} films in which she appeared—Some Like It Hot and The Asphalt Jungle—have {{been added to the}} Library of Congress's National Film Registry, and the former earned her a Golden Globe for Best Actress.

5|$|Portal 2 is a first-person {{perspective}} puzzle game. The Player {{takes the}} role of Chell in the single-player campaign, as one of two robotsAtlas and P-Bodyin the cooperative campaign, or as a simplistic humanoid <b>icon</b> <b>in</b> community-developed puzzles. These four characters can explore and interact with the environment. Characters can withstand limited damage but will die after sustained injury. There is no penalty for falling onto a solid surface, but falling into bottomless pits or toxic pools kills the player character immediately. When Chell dies in the single-player game, the game restarts from a recent checkpoint; in the cooperative game, the robot respawns shortly afterwards without restarting the puzzle. The goal of both campaigns is to explore the Aperture Science Laboratory—a complicated, malleable mechanized maze. While most of the game takes place in modular test chambers with clearly defined entrances and exits, other parts occur in behind-the-scenes areas where the objective is less clear.|$|E
5|$|Revelations: Persona is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} in which the player takes control {{of a group of}} high school students. A mixture of navigation styles are used: navigation round the students' hometown is done using an overhead view, navigation of standard environments such as outside areas and story locations use an angled third-person view, and dungeons and most buildings are navigating in first-person. An <b>icon</b> <b>in</b> the top right-hand corner of the screen displays a lunar phase: this display shows the passage of in-game time, and its status determines the activity patterns and moods of enemy demons. Battles are both triggered by story events and through random encounters around the world map and dungeon environments. If the player attacks an enemy from behind, the party is given a set of attacks costing no magic points or health points.|$|E
5|$|Riya's {{on-screen}} performances {{have established}} {{her as a}} bold youth <b>icon</b> <b>in</b> India. Since entering the film industry, she has gained attention for wearing a bikini in Shaadi No. 1 and sharing on-screen kisses with co-stars Ashmit Patel in Silsiilay and Sharman Joshi in Style, respectively. Such performances garnered negative attention because of the relatively conservative outlook of Indian cinema {{at that time and}} her own statements about such practices. In 2008, Riya Sen was also linked to author Salman Rushdie. Before becoming a film star, she had a reputation for partying, which started at the age of fifteen. Riya's public persona is compared to her mother Moon Moon, who was seen as a sex symbol of her time, while her sister Raima is mostly compared to their grandmother Suchitra.|$|E
