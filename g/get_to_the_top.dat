25|$|From the carpark {{at the end}} of Glenesk Road, {{directions}} {{are clearly}} signposted. A well formed loop track, used by around 30,000 people a year (2005), follows the Glen Esk Stream with minor undulations (on the south side) up to a lookout where you find a huge Macrocarpa bench seat to rest on and admire the view. The bench seat was made by offenders doing community work (2005). The track then descends down wooden steps {{to the base of the}} falls (40 minutes from the carpark). The track then crosses the stream next to the lower swimming hole and returns down the north side. However, instead of going down again, a walker can climb a reasonably steep track (the Connect Track) which begins about 100m from the base of the falls on the northern side of the stream. It takes about 15 minutes to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the falls. There is a good swimming hole at the top although the water is cool. From this high vantage point there are great views down the valley.|$|E

Willich's success assisted Beatty's brigade to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b> The two brigades first drove off Brig. Gen. Arthur M. Manigault's men and continued rolling north. As they came up the ridge, the Union brigades of Turchin, Van Derveer, and Phelps (who was killed near the crest) added their weight to the assault against the Confederate brigades of Brig. Gens. Zachariah C. Deas, Alfred J. Vaughan, and John K. Jackson. Some Confederate soldiers resisted stubbornly, but many panicked and ran when they realized that Union troops were bearing down on them from the flank. Often, the Southern infantry fled before the supporting artillerists could escape with their cannons. In this manner, Anderson's entire division and Cheatham's left flank brigades of Brig. Gens. Jackson and Moore were routed. The northward Federal advance was only stopped by the stout fighting of Walthall's brigade and nightfall. Cheatham, Gist, Stevenson, and Cleburne were able to get their divisions away more or less intact, although the Confederate soldiers were demoralized and chagrined by their defeat.|$|E

In rock climbing, style refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> method of ascending the cliff. There are three main styles of climbing: on-sight, flash, and redpoint. To on-sight a route is <b>to</b> ascend <b>the</b> wall without aid or any foreknowledge. It is considered <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> climb with <b>the</b> most style. Flashing {{is similar to}} on-sighting, except that the climber has previous information about the route including talking about the beta with other climbers. Redpointing means to make a free ascent of the route after having first tried it.|$|R

I don't want to have to take it– I have too much respect for my body." [...] Two years before his death, Simpson hinted in the newspaper, The People, at drug-taking in races, although he implied that he himself was not involved. Asked about drugs by Eamonn Andrews on the BBC Home Service radio network, Simpson did not deny taking them; however, he said that a rider who frequently took drugs might <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> but would not stay there.|$|E

500|$|Long an {{advocate}} for gender equality in climbing, Hill has argued {{that men and women}} can climb the same routes: [...] "I think they should have women compete on the same climbs as the men, and if the women can't do the climbs, then they shouldn't be competing". For example, she argued that both sexes compete on the same routes in World Cup competitions. However, Hill later revised her view, noting that while she could and did compete with men [...] "spectators want to see people <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b> And since most women aren't climbing at the same level as the top men, it's necessary to design a route that's a little easier for women". In answer to a question about whether or not women [...] "will ever equal or surpass men in climbing", Hill gave a detailed response, focused on body composition, size, and psychology, explaining that climbing [...] "favors people with high strength-to-weight ratios", less body fat, and greater height, articulating that such characteristics often favor men but that women [...] "have the advantage of being relatively light, with the capacity for tremendous endurance". She explained that [...] "theoretically somebody as short as me could be {{the best in the world}} because it doesn't depend so much on height now...

500|$|From 1986 to 1992 Hill {{was one of}} the world's top sport climbers, {{winning over}} thirty {{international}} titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1990, at the final stage of the World Cup Final, she was one of three competitors and the only woman to reach the top of the wall—and the only climber to complete the hardest move. As Joseph Taylor writes in his history of climbers of Yosemite, [...] "at that moment Lynn Hill was arguably the best climber in the world, male or female". Hill describes this as her most satisfying win because her competition—Isabelle Patissier—received information on how to do the final climb from the men who had already finished it. Moreover, Hill was starting with zero points in the competition because she had made a mistake in the previous competition, so she had to win big or not at all (the World Cup consisted of a series of competitions in which the participants were given points for a variety of climbing techniques). [...] "It took all of my effort and concentration to pull through the route. The moves I had to make were really spectacular, but I managed to do them. I was so excited to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top...</b> I proved a point about women and what we're capable of—a lot of the best men had fallen off that route." [...] As a professional climber, Hill was able during this time to support herself by doing what she loved; she made approximately half of her income from climbing competitions and half from sponsorships.|$|E
