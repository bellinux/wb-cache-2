5000|$|In DPP v Smith (Michael Ross), the {{defendant}} held down his former girlfriend {{and cut off}} her ponytail with <b>kitchen</b> <b>scissors</b> {{a few weeks before}} her 21st birthday. The Magistrates acquitted him on the ground that, although there was undoubtedly an assault, it had not caused actual bodily harm, since there was no bruising or bleeding, and no evidence of any psychological or psychiatric harm.

5000|$|The {{character}} {{returned to}} Holby City proper in February 2006, accepting the General Surgical Consultancy that his old flame Jac Naylor {{had been hoping}} to be appointed to. Rosie Marcel, who plays Jac, described the characters' reunion: [...] "She bumps into Nick outside the hospital and the look of disgust on her face says it all. It's clear they have some really bad history between them. And then to her fury, Nick announces that he's back to stay and has been offered Jac's coveted consultant post. They've worked together before and Jac knows Nick will tread on anyones toes {{to get to the}} top. It makes for some great fight scenes." [...] When the character departed from the show again several months later, the situation was manipulated by Cardiothoracic Consultant Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing). Mealing commented: [...] "Connie takes Nick along to a charity evening so that he can scmooze sic Lord Byrne. She knows Nick might try to worm his way into her medical department and she won't play second fiddle to him. So she's hoping Lord Byrne will take him on at his hospital, St Luke's." [...] During the course of the evening, a bomb was detonated by Derek, a deceased patient's relative. [...] "Connie and Nick are unharmed in the blast, but Derek's badly hurt - so they have to treat him using kitchen utensils. They employ tea towels, <b>kitchen</b> knives, <b>scissors</b> and even tongs. It's all quite ingenious! Lord Byrne is outside the kitchen. So to get his attention, she asks Nick to perform heart surgery - which is something she would normally do. Her idea works a treat. That's why I love Connie. She's always got an agenda!" ...|$|R

50|$|Scissors are {{hand-operated}} shearing tools. They {{consist of}} a pair of metal blades pivoted so that the sharpened edges slide against each other when the handles (bows) opposite to the pivot are closed. Scissors are used for cutting various thin materials, such as paper, cardboard, metal foil, cloth, rope, and wire. A large variety of scissors and shears all exist for specialized purposes. Hair-cutting shears and kitchen shears are functionally equivalent to scissors, but the larger implements tend to be called shears. Hair-cutting shears have specific blade angles ideal for cutting hair. Using the incorrect scissors to cut hair will result in increased damage or split ends, or both, by breaking the hair. Kitchen shears, also known as <b>kitchen</b> <b>scissors,</b> are intended for cutting and trimming foods such as meats.|$|E

Common fillings include ground beef, shiitake mushrooms, cucumber, crumbled tofu, chopped scallions, minced garlic and toasted and ground sesame seeds. The inner surface of each fish slice is dusted with mung bean starch, the filling is placed on it and it is then folded in half and sealed. The edges of the dumplings are trimmed with <b>kitchen</b> <b>scissors</b> to create the half-moon shapes. The dumplings are then coated with mung bean starch, and cooked either in boiling water or in the steamer lined with Boston ivy leaves. Cooked dumplings are commonly served with a dipping sauce such as mustard or choganjang (soy sauce mixed with vinegar).|$|E
500|$|Donald B. Wagner {{writes that}} most {{domestic}} iron tools and implements produced during the Han {{were made of}} cheaper and more brittle cast iron, whereas the military preferred to use wrought iron and steel weaponry due to their more durable qualities. During the Han dynasty, the typical [...] bronze sword found in the Warring States period was gradually replaced with an iron sword measuring roughly [...] in length. The ancient dagger-axe (ge) made of bronze was still used by Han soldiers, although it was gradually phased out by iron spears and iron ji halberds. Even arrowheads, which were traditionally made of bronze, gradually only had a bronze tip and iron shaft, {{until the end of}} the Han when the entire arrowhead was made solely of iron. Farmers, carpenters, bamboo craftsmen, stonemasons, and rammed earth builders had at their disposal iron tools such as the plowshare, pickaxe, spade, shovel, hoe, sickle, axe, adze, hammer, chisel, knife, saw, scratch awl, and nails. Common iron commodities found in Han dynasty homes included tripods, stoves, cooking pots, belt buckles, tweezers, fire tongs, <b>scissors,</b> <b>kitchen</b> knives, fish hooks, and needles. Mirrors and oil lamps were often made of either bronze or iron. Coin money minted during the Han was made of either copper or copper and tin smelted together to make the bronze alloy.|$|R
