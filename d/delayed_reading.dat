40|$|PURPOSE: Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} that eye movements differ between good/average and poor readers. However, these studies have been limited to investigating eye movements during reading related tasks, and thus, the differences found could arise from deficits in higher cognitive processes involved in reading rather than oculomotor performance. The {{purpose of the study}} is {{to determine the extent to}} which eye movements in children with <b>delayed</b> <b>reading</b> skills are different to those obtained from children with good/average reading skills in non-reading related tasks. METHODS: After a screening optometric assessment, eye movement recordings were obtained from 120 children without <b>delayed</b> <b>reading</b> skills and 43 children with <b>delayed</b> <b>reading</b> skills (4 to 11 years) using a Tobii TX 300 eye tracker. Cartoon characters were presented horizontally from - 20 ° to + 20 ° in steps of 5 ° to study saccades. An animated stimulus in the centre of the screen was presented for 8 seconds to study fixation stability. Saccadic main sequences, and the number and amplitude of the saccades during fixation were obtained for each participant. Children with <b>delayed</b> <b>reading</b> skills (n = 43) were unmasked after data collection was completed. Medians and quartiles were calculated for each eye movement parameter for children without (n = 120) and with (n = 43) <b>delayed</b> <b>reading</b> skills. RESULTS: Independent t-tests with Bonferroni correction showed no significant differences in any of the saccadic main sequence parameters (Slope, Intercept, A, n and Q ratio) between children without and with <b>delayed</b> <b>reading</b> (p > 0. 01). Similarly, no significant differences were found in the number of saccades and their amplitude during the fixation task between the two groups (p > 0. 05). Further, none of the gross optometric parameters assessed (visual acuity, refractive error, ocular alignment, convergence, stereopsis and accommodation accuracy) were found to be associated with <b>delayed</b> <b>reading</b> skills (p > 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Eye movements in children with <b>delayed</b> <b>reading</b> skills are quantitatively similar to those found in children without <b>delayed</b> <b>reading</b> skills. These findings suggest that, in these children, <b>delayed</b> <b>reading</b> skills are not associated with eye movements and further question interventions targeted at improving eye movement control...|$|E

40|$|Three {{experiments}} of pseudoword reading assessed whether stress assignment affects {{reading aloud}} {{at the level}} of articulation planning. In experiment 1 (immediate reading) both stimulus length (in syllables) and stress type affected reading latency and accuracy. Italian pseudowords were named faster and more accurately when they were assigned stress on the antepenultimate than on the penultimate syllable. In experiment 2 (<b>delayed</b> <b>reading)</b> reading aloud of the same stimuli was not affected by length but was still affected by stress type, with shorter latencies for pseudowords stressed on the antepenultimate syllable. Experiment 3 replicated the results of the first two experiments with new materials and with a tightly controlled procedure. These results indicate that stress assignment exerts an effect in a processing component where articulation is planned as articulation can not start until stress is assigned. Our results also suggest that, in reading aloud, the minimal planning unit for articulation is smaller than the whole stimulus, including the first syllable up to the stressed unit...|$|E

We report the first case of cutaneous adverse drug reaction (CADR) to ESL and co-sensitization between ESL and betalactams. A 41 -year-old white woman developed focal epilepsy due to a meningioma that was removed. As post-operatory complication, she suffered meningitis {{as well as a}} maculo-papular erythema caused by the treatment with meropenem. Subsequently, ESL was started and gradually increased until 800 mg/day. Twenty-five days later, the patient developed an Erythema Multiforme Major (EMM). Strong positive immediate reaction was induced by prick test with carbamazepine (CBZ) and ESL at 0. 01 and 0. 1 % within 15 and 30 minutes; however the <b>delayed</b> <b>reading</b> at 48 hours was negative. The patient was not carrier of the HLA alleles A 3101 and B 1502 associated with CBZ induced EMM. The hypersensitivity pathogenic mechanism of EMM is unclear and a delayed hypersensitivity process is speculated. However, the patch and intradermal tests in our patient did not show a delayed reaction but an immediate cutaneous one. A first allergic episode may elicit a massive nonspecific activation of the immune system, providing an enhanced expression of co-stimulatory molecules that decreases the level of tolerance to other drugs. When prescribing ESL, we suggest ruling out previous CADR, especially to CBZ and oxcarbazepine but also other chemically unrelated drugs such as beta-lactams...|$|E

It also aimed to replicate with them an intervention designed by Church, Nixon, Zintl and Williams (2005). The study finally {{aimed to explore}} {{the question of whether}} children who have both a reading delay and a disruptive behaviour disorder require a reinforcement scheme to maintain their engagement in learning activities. Six participants worked with same-age peer tutors on specially-designed practice activities for approximately 20 minutes a day, four times a week, for 8 - 18 sessions. Improvement in decoding fluency and prose reading fluency was tracked for each child throughout the intervention. Results showed that the six participants gained, on average, sixteen months on their age-equivalent score for reading rate. Decoding fluency scores increased from a pre-test average of 16 correct graphemes per minute to 32 correct graphemes per minute at the post-test measure. Reading accuracy improved by an average of five months and reading comprehension by an average of six months. The gains in reading rate are most likely due to the practice opportunities afforded by the testing procedures as decoding fluency scores did not improve enough to have had a direct impact on the learners’ prose reading ability. Implications for remedial reading interventions with children with behaviour problems are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Verbs with {{multiple}} senses can show varying argument structure frequencies, {{depending on the}} underlying sense. When acknowledge is used to mean ‘recognise’, it takes a direct object (DO), but when {{it is used to}} mean ‘admit’ it prefers a sentence complement (SC). The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether people with aphasia (PWA) can exploit such meaning-structure probabilities during the reading of temporarily ambiguous sentences, as demonstrated for neurologically healthy individuals (NHI) in a self-paced reading study (Hare et al., 2003). Eleven people with mild or moderate aphasia and eleven neurologically healthy control participants read sentences while their eyes were tracked. Using adapted materials from the study by Hare et al., target sentences containing an SC structure (e. g. He acknowledged (that) his friends would probably help him a lot) were presented following a context prime that biased either a direct object (DO-bias) or sentence complement (SC-bias) reading of the verbs. Half of the stimuli sentences did not contain that so made the post verbal noun phrase (his friends) structurally ambiguous. Both groups of participants were influenced by structural ambiguity as well as by the context bias, indicating that PWA can, like NHI, use their knowledge of a verb’s sense-based argument structure frequency during online sentence reading. However, the individuals with aphasia showed <b>delayed</b> <b>reading</b> patterns and some individual differences in their sensitivity to context and ambiguity cues.

40|$|Seven- and eight-year-old {{skilled and}} less-skilled comprehenders were {{compared}} on a sentence recognition task in two conditions varying in memory load and retention interval.

Skilled comprehenders exhibited more accurate memory for sentences than less-skilled comprehenders. However, the {{groups did not differ}} in {{the degree to which they}} integrated information with minimal memory demand, or in their tendency to integrate information and retain the integrated representations with increased memory demand. These results were interpreted as evidence that integration deficits do not lie at the root of reading comprehension difficulties in mainstream children. The purpose of reading comprehension is to understand information presented in the text. Unfortunately, some children find reading comprehension a particularly difficult task. In some cases <b>delayed</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension reflects weak decoding skills. However, 10 – 15 % of mainstream children exhibit weak reading comprehension despite good decoding skills (e. g. Nation & Snowling, 1997). With reduced ability to derive meaning from written materials, these children’s learning of text-based educational topics is at risk. Failure to understand is therefore a crucial problem. One theory as to why this occurs is that some children fail to integrate information within a text. If true, integration skills may be targeted to motivate and assist children’s reading comprehension in the classroom. This work therefore explores whether an integration deficit underlies reading comprehension difficulties...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we explore the {{development}} of phonological and lexical reading in dyslexic children. We tested a group of 14 Italian {{children who have been}} diagnosed with dyslexia and whose reading age is end of grade 1. We compared this group with a group of 70 typically developing children who have been tested for reading at the end of grade 1. For each dyslexic child we also selected a participant who was attending the same grade, was close in age, and showed typical reading development when tested with a narrative passage reading task (Cornoldi, Colpo, & Gruppo MT, 1981) for correctness and reading speed. Children in this group are "same grade controls. " We used a reading task consisting of 40 three syllables words. A qualitative and quantitative method of coding children's naming allowed us to distinguish several components of their reading performance: the grapheme and word recognition, the size of orthographic units involved in the aloud orthography-phonology conversion, the reading process used to recognize words. The comparison of the dyslexic group with the reading age and the same grade control groups reveals different trends of <b>delayed</b> <b>reading</b> processes. Considering dyslexic children's chronological age, lexical reading is greatly delayed. Considering dyslexic children's reading age, the type of reading process that is more deeply delayed is phonological reading.

40|$|Children with {{specific}} language impairment frequently encounter difficulties {{in learning to}} read and in particular, in word recognition. The present study set out to determine the precise impact of language impairment on word reading skills. We investigated single-word reading in 27 French children {{with specific}} speech and language impairment (2 SLI). Precise quantification of reading levels in the 2 SLI group showed an average delay of 3. 5 years. Approximately 90 % of these children were affected by a reading disorder, whereas for the remaining 10 %, reading performance was within normal limits. Word reading procedures are analyzed using the so-called ‘dual route model’, which proposes that reading is achieved through two processes, the phonological and the orthographic procedures. Group comparison analyses of 27 reading level-matched control children, revealed an increased lexicality effect in the 2 SLI group, indicating a specific deficit in the phonological procedure. Moreover, multiple case analyses revealed interindividual differences among the children with 2 SLI, with four reading subtypes. Approximately 60 % of these children reached the standard levels expected of younger children with identical reading levels (<b>delayed</b> <b>reading</b> profile) in both procedures. Twenty percent displayed qualitatively different reading mechanisms, with a greater deficit in the phonological procedure (phonological profile).

The LI and PD groups exhibited similar patterns of reading impairment, attributed to low phonological skills. However, only the LI group showed clear speech perception deficits, suggesting that such deficits affect only a subset of dyslexics. Results also indicated phonological impairments in children whose speech perception was normal. Both the LI and PD groups showed inflectional morphology difficulties, with the impairment being more severe in the LI group. The <b>Delay</b> group's <b>reading</b> and language skills closely matched those of younger normal readers, suggesting these children had a general <b>delay</b> in <b>reading</b> and language skills, rather than a specific phonological impairment. The results are {{discussed in terms of}} models of word recognition and dyslexia...|$|R
