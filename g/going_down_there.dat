6000|$|... "We are not <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> to {{get into}} any fights," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "We are <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> to attend strictly to business. If the Mexicans will only leave us alone, we'll leave them alone." ...|$|E
60|$|He knew {{as well as}} I {{did that}} it was just as likely, at that time of year, I was <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> whaling; but I felt complimented, too.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Aunt Juley, [...] "you will be <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> soon {{to settle}} in. We are all so {{looking forward to}} the time when Annette has a dear little...." ...|$|E
60|$|Tommy and {{the nurse}} and I were <b>going</b> <b>down</b> town. <b>There</b> is some {{shopping}} she wants to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I hope {{we shall}} get a little, this evening. And now I must be <b>going</b> <b>down,</b> for <b>there</b> {{is a good}} deal to do, before we sail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall risk it, Grooton," [...] I answered. [...] "I {{think that}} the wind is <b>going</b> <b>down,</b> and <b>there</b> won't be a soul about. It's too good a chance to miss." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you are <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> sir," [...] he said, [...] "I {{will send}} James Green to meet you. Mrs. Peterson is {{so fond of}} the game that she keeps a Scotchman here {{to look after the}} links and {{instruct}} her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We were <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> now {{to call on}} the Stanhopes," [...] said Dick. [...] "They {{have come}} here {{for the benefit of}} Mrs. Stanhope's health, and Nellie and Grace Laning are with them. I guess you know them all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is my own}} affair," [...] {{retorted}} Old Mr. Toad, [...] "but if {{you really}} want to know, I'll tell you. I have a very important part in the spring chorus, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> to sing. I have a very beautiful voice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Dan," [...] Vincent said at last, [...] "give me that compass, {{and get out}} the food. We {{will have}} a better meal than we did this morning, for now that the wind is <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>there's</b> no chance of food running short. When we have had dinner we will get up the sail again. The sea is not so rough as it was, and it is {{certainly}} not so high as it was before we lowered the sail yesterday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Beechnut, [...] "they {{are only}} <b>going</b> <b>down</b> to drink. <b>There</b> is a brook <b>down</b> <b>there</b> {{where they go}} to drink when they are at work in this field." ...|$|R
6000|$|Aloud, to Harry: [...] "Say, what's it like in Kansas? I'm <b>going</b> <b>down</b> through <b>there</b> some day." [...] He spoke harshly. But {{the real}} Carl was robed in {{light and the}} murmurous wake of evening, with the tropics down the sky-line.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! that is {{the same}} as mine. I have got a couple of boxes of cartridges, and as they are done up in india-rubber they are sure to be all right. By the way, is it true that we are all <b>going</b> <b>down?</b> <b>There</b> was a rumour last night that orders had come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear child, it's {{perfectly}} simple. This earl {{of yours}} {{has taken the}} thing off to his castle, like a brigand. You say you are <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> on Friday for a visit. All {{you have to do}} is to take me along with you, and sit back and watch me get busy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you'll {{be safe to}} {{meet the}} reddleman that I told ye of," [...] said Fairway. [...] "He's only gone back to get his van. We heard that your niece {{and her husband were}} coming {{straight}} home {{as soon as they were}} married, and we are <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> shortly, to give 'em a song o' welcome." ...|$|E
6000|$|O Pickering, come hither to the brink-- <b>There's</b> {{something}} <b>going</b> on <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> I think! With many {{an upward}} smile and meaning wink The navvies all are {{running from the}} cut Like lunatics, to right and left-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a wreck!" [...] he whooped. [...] "It's the life-savers! Mother, I'm <b>going</b> <b>down.</b> Maybe <b>there's</b> {{something}} I can do. I want to {{do something}} again! Maybe some poor devil coming ashore in the breeches buoy--help him ashore-- Don't suppose I could row--" ...|$|R
500|$|... "Slow Fade" [...] {{was written}} in the [...] "light of the well publicised falls from grace of several high profile church leaders". According to lead vocalist Mark Hall: [...] "Nobody falls, it's just a slow fade. It's a series of minor compromises until you're in a place you never thought you'd be, doing things you never thought you'd do and rationalising all of it". He {{continued}} by saying that: [...] "As believers, as men, if we're not guarding our relationship with God, we're <b>going</b> <b>down.</b> <b>There's</b> too much <b>going</b> against us. If we're not careful, we're going to crash and burn".|$|R
60|$|Soon after Rollo {{had engaged}} the boat, {{his father and}} mother came, and they all {{embarked}} on board. The boatman rowed them off from the shore. The sun was just <b>going</b> <b>down.</b> <b>There</b> were a great many boats plying to and fro about the lake, and the quays and the little islet were crowded with people.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't either," [...] said Mavering, [...] "when I left Boston. Of course I knew I was <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> to see her, {{but when}} I got there it kept going on, just like {{anything}} else, {{up to the}} last moment. I didn't realise till it came to the worst that I had become a mere pulp." ...|$|E
6000|$|The gauche boy {{gone from}} him, Milt took her hand, pressed {{it to his}} cheek. [...] "Claire! You're here! You might have gone with him, to make room---- Oh, I was {{bullying}} you because I was bullying myself! Trying to make myself tell you--but oh, you know, you know! Can you stand <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>there?</b> I hate to have you, but you may be needed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{wrote me}} about the row--didn't you know it? Then I broke. You didn't suppose I was <b>going</b> to stay <b>down</b> <b>there</b> when there were such times up here." ...|$|R
60|$|In effect, {{the sun was}} so {{low that}} it dipped at the moment. When the heavy drag had been {{adjusted}} to the wheel, and the carriage slid down hill, with a cinderous smell, {{in a cloud of}} dust, the red glow departed quickly; the sun and the Marquis <b>going</b> <b>down</b> together, <b>there</b> was no glow left when the drag was taken off.|$|R
50|$|The flag {{contains}} the four Pan-Arab colors: black, white, green and red. There are three horizontal stripes: black, green, and white, <b>going</b> <b>down</b> the flag. <b>There</b> {{is also a}} red triangle on the hoist side of the flag.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} is. Everybody knows that. What the deuce {{was the good}} then of our <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>there?</b> I couldn't do anything, and I knew he wouldn't. The truth is, Mistletoe, a man now-a-days may do just what he pleases. You ain't in that line and it won't do you any good knowing it, but since we did away with pistols {{everybody}} may do just what he likes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gently!" [...] Francis said. [...] "You must remember, {{there may}} be people <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> at present, getting up stores. Before we venture to disturb a plank, we must make the hole {{sufficiently}} large for us to spy through. This {{will be a very}} easy affair, in comparison with making a hole large enough for a saw to go through. Still, you will find it will take some time. However, we had better wait, as we agreed, till we have had our food." ...|$|E
60|$|Wilkinson and two {{or three}} others who were off duty went down at once with Edgar, and as the news spread among the others, every {{midshipman}} who could possibly get away unnoticed, stole off also, and joined them on the lower deck. Half a dozen lanterns were lighted and hung up from the beams. A few of the sailors, seeing so many midshipmen <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> guessed that there was a fight coming off, and descending the hatchway forward, stole noiselessly aft to watch it.|$|E
500|$|... 00:24:30	Graham Hawkes is {{now going}} to return to the phantom five, and using a new submersible, he is <b>going</b> to go <b>down</b> <b>there</b> himself and find out, once and for all, who they are.|$|R
500|$|The {{competitors}} replenished {{their food}} stock at the feed zone situated {{shortly after the}} downhill section. The main field started accelerating, with the team of the leader Tom Dumoulin Giant-Alpecin {{doing most of the}} work at the front. Realizing this breakaway was gaining ground, Tinkoff-Saxo came to the fore to help, resulting in the gap <b>going</b> <b>down</b> gradually. <b>There</b> was [...] to cover as the gap was hovering around 4' 30".|$|R
5000|$|Thompson then {{flew over}} an {{irrigation}} ditch filled {{with dozens of}} bodies. Shocked at the sight, he radioed his accompanying gunships, knowing his transmission would be monitored by many on the net: [...] "It {{looks to me like}} there's an awful lot of unnecessary killing <b>going</b> on <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> Something ain't right about this. There's bodies everywhere. There's a ditch full of bodies that we saw. There's something wrong here." ...|$|R
6000|$|How long {{he slept}} {{he could not}} tell, but the sun was high when he awoke, and his clothes were quite dry. Other signs there were that he had slept long, such as the {{steadiness}} of the breeze and the more regular motion of the vessel, which showed that the gale was over and the sea <b>going</b> <b>down.</b> <b>There</b> was also a powerful sensation in what he styled his [...] "bread-basket"--though it might, with equal truth, have been called his meat-and-vegetable basket--which told him more eloquently than anything else of the lapse of time.|$|E
6000|$|After {{a day of}} sight-seeing we returned, at sunset, to the Springs, {{with all}} of the pomp of railway magnates en tour, and as we were about to part at the railway station, the General in curt, off-hand way, asked, [...] "Why not join my camping party at Sierra Blanca? We're <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> for a week or two, and I shall be very glad to have you with us. Come, and stay as long as you can. We shall {{probably}} move on to Wagon Wheel Gap later. Wagon Wheel ought to interest you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't a town," [...] said Mr. Westgate, laughing. [...] "It's a--well, {{what shall}} I call it? It's a {{watering}} place. In short, it's Newport. You'll {{see what it}} is. It's cool; that's the principal thing. You will greatly oblige me by <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> and putting yourself {{into the hands of}} Mrs. Westgate. It isn't perhaps for me to say it, but you couldn't be in better hands. Also in those of her sister, who is staying with her. She is very fond of Englishmen. She thinks there is nothing like them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you don’t now," [...] {{said the}} mate, [...] "you will at tea-time. I’m not <b>going</b> to sit <b>down</b> <b>there</b> with them alone again. You needn’t think it If you {{was to ask}} me what I’ve been eating I couldn’t tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} now," [...] said the mate, [...] "you will at tea time. I'm not <b>going</b> to sit <b>down</b> <b>there</b> with them again alone. You needn't think it. If you {{was to ask}} me what I've been eating I couldn't tell you." ...|$|R
