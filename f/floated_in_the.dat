25|$|A {{hypothesis}} that insect feeding may improve plant fitness was <b>floated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-1970s by Owen and Wiegert.

In a nitrogen poor environment, this could provide an advantage to an infested plant over a noninfested plant. However, this {{does not appear to}} be supported by the observational evidence.|$|E

25|$|The 1823 {{campaign}} in Western Greece {{was led by}} Mustafa Reshit Pasha and Omer Vrioni. During the summer the Souliot Markos Botsaris was shot dead at the Battle of Karpenisi {{in his attempt to}} stop the advance of the Ottomans; the announcement of his death in Europe generated a wave of sympathy for the Greek cause. The campaign ended after the Second Siege of Missolonghi in December 1823. In February 1824, the loan for Greece was <b>floated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> City, attracting some £472, 000 pounds sterling, which was money that the Greeks badly needed.|$|E
25|$|The highway {{itself was}} planned {{as early as}} the 1920s. The {{above-ground}} Artery was built in two sections. First was the part north of High Street and Broad Street to the Tobin Bridge, built between 1951 and 1954. Immediately, residents began to hate the new highway and the way it towered over and separated neighborhoods. Due to this opposition, {{the southern end of the}} Central Artery through the South Station area was built underground, through what became known as the Dewey Square Tunnel. Eventually, the entire highway was moved underground as part of the Big Dig Project. The Dewey Square Tunnel was the one part of the original Artery not torn down; it now serves southbound traffic. The idea of building the entire Artery underground was first <b>floated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s emanating from the central artery depression concept developed by the Boston Transportation Planning Review. The final section through the Dewey Square Tunnel and on to the Southeast Expressway at Massachusetts Avenue opened in 1959.|$|E

25|$|On 7 February 1825, {{a second}} loan to Greece was <b>floated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> City of London. Despite {{the fact that}} the Greek {{government}} had squandered the money from the first loan, the second loan was oversubscribed and raised some £1.1 million. Unlike the first loan, the second loan from the City was to be managed by a Board of Control in London, consisting of the banker Samson Ricardo, two MPs, Edward Ellice and Sir Francis Burdett and John Cam Hobhouse of the London Greek Committee, who were to use the money to buy warships and other supplies, which would then be handed over to the Greeks. After the Greek government had wasted most of the money from the first loan, the City did not trust them to spend the money from the second loan wisely. The Board of Control used the money to hire the naval hero, Lord Cochrane, to command the Greek Navy and to buy steamships. One of the British philhellenes, Frank Abney Hastings believed that the use of mechanised warships powered by steam and using red-hot shot would allow the Greeks to destroy the Ottoman navy, powered as it was by sail. Hastings persuaded the Board of Control to invest in the revolutionary technology of the steamship, making the first use of a mechanised warship in a war. The two loans from the City imposed a crippling burden on a poor nation like Greece, and only in 1878 was a deal struck between the British creditors and the Greek government to reduce the loans, now worth £10 million, with unpaid interest down to one and a half million pounds sterling, and even then it took the Greeks decades to pay off the loans.|$|E

500|$|Among the {{captured}} Byzantine magnates of Amorium, the strategos Aetios was executed {{soon after his}} capture, perhaps, as the historian Warren Treadgold suggests, in retaliation to Theophilos's second letter to the caliph. After years of captivity and no hope of ransom, the rest were urged to convert to Islam. When they refused, they were executed at Samarra on 6 March 845, and are celebrated in the Eastern Orthodox Church as the 42 Martyrs of Amorium. Several tales also sprung up around Boiditzes and his betrayal. According to {{the legend of the}} 42 Martyrs, he converted to Islam, but was nevertheless executed by the caliph alongside the other captives; unlike the others, however, whose bodies [...] "miraculously" [...] <b>floated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water of the river Tigris, his sank to the bottom.|$|E
