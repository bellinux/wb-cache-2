After singing a duet with Alfredo, Violetta {{suddenly}} revives, exclaiming that the pain and discomfort have left <b>her.</b> <b>A</b> <b>moment</b> later, she dies in Alfredo's arms.|$|E
2500|$|As they battle, a roar {{is heard}} {{from above and}} they both turn to see Aslan and a fresh army [...] of Narnian {{reinforcements}} arrive to join the battle, to the Witch's shock that Aslan is alive after she personally slew him. As some of the White Witch's tired soldiers are trampled by ground shaking wave of Aslan's reinforcements, Mr. Tumnus knocks down a goblin with another lion running {{next to him and}} Rumblebuffin uses his club on two minotaurs. Peter and the White Witch continue to fight and the White Witch gains the upper hand, tripping Peter to the ground with her sword, pins his arm to the ground, and knocks his shield out of his hand. Just as she prepares to kill him, Aslan charges at the White Witch and knocks her back, as she barely has time to look up and see him pounce at <b>her.</b> <b>A</b> <b>moment</b> of eerie peace ensues as the Witch accepts her doom and Aslan decapitates her. As the reinforcements charge past to scour the battlefield, Aslan tells Peter that [...] "It is finished." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{glanced at}} <b>her,</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment’s</b> {{amusement}} softening his features.|$|R
6000|$|The {{sound of}} {{a knock at the}} door gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> respite. [...] "The postman," [...] she {{explained}} as she rose to go to the door.|$|R
60|$|As soon as Mr. Pilgrim {{was able}} to give <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> attention, he came to her, and, taking her by the arm, {{attempted}} to draw her gently out of the room.|$|R
60|$|The young man, who had seated himself, {{looked at}} <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E

60|$|She {{looked at}} him fondly as he held <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in his arms.|$|E
60|$|Theodora {{could not}} accuse her of over-carefulness of <b>her</b> renown as <b>a</b> beauty. <b>Her</b> dress was, of course, appropriate, but aimed at no more; and her worn, languid {{appearance}} {{did not cause}} <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> thought, since Arthur was not there to see.|$|R
50|$|Thursday morning. The schoolteacher Nira, who {{worries about}} her marriage, goes to work. One of her pupils jumps out and {{performs}} a love rap song {{he wrote for}} <b>her.</b> For <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>her</b> heart faints. <b>A</b> <b>moment,</b> which changes <b>her</b> life.|$|R

60|$|Weston {{looked at}} <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> hesitatingly, {{and then made}} a little gesture of deprecation.|$|E
60|$|Violet was disappointed; for {{the tone}} of enthusiasm had given <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> hope that they had at last found a subject on which they could grow warm together, but {{it was evident that}} Theodora would never so have spoken had she been {{conscious}} of her presence.|$|R
60|$|A {{rattling}} laugh, {{which seemed}} beyond her control, interrupted <b>her</b> for <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{set down}} his teacup and smiled at <b>her</b> for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> gravely.|$|R
60|$|With {{which he}} stood {{watching}} <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> then {{went away to}} wait for her.|$|E

60|$|Brooks {{looked at}} <b>her</b> for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> amazed beside himself with wonder and self-reproach.|$|R
60|$|Bernard {{looked at}} <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> then came {{straight}} {{back into the}} drawing-room and took his hat.|$|E
60|$|His clear, greenish-grey eyes {{rested on}} <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and, as he considered, {{he did not}} see her.|$|E
60|$|Fiorsen {{stared at}} <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{in the way}} that--as the maid often said--made {{you feel like a}} silly.|$|E
60|$|MRS. CLANDON (puzzled {{and rather}} troubled; after {{watching}} <b>her</b> for <b>a</b> <b>moment).</b> My dear.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} <b>her</b> for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{and there were}} {{wonderful}} things in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked down}} at <b>her</b> for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> as he held her close to him.|$|R
6000|$|He rose, leaning heavily upon a gold-headed cane, {{and looked}} at <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> without speaking, his brows contracted. Then: ...|$|E
6000|$|Dunwoodie {{gazed at}} <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in {{abstracted}} musing, {{and the question}} was repeated. He answered gravely, and with some reserve,-- ...|$|E
