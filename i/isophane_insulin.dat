50|$|NPH insulin, {{also known}} as <b>isophane</b> <b>insulin,</b> is an intermediate-acting insulin given to help control blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. It is used by {{injection}} under the skin once to twice a day. Onset of effects is typically in 90 minutes and they last for 24 hours. Versions are available that come premixed with a short-acting insulin, such as regular insulin.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years short-acting insulin analogs have become {{increasingly}} popular.

40|$|L ipohypertrophy is {{a common}} side ef-fect of {{subcutaneous}} insulin therapy,occurring in up to 50 % of patients with type 1 diabetes (1 – 3). It is generally held that absorption of insulin from such palpably abnormal sites is erratic, al-though the consequence thereof on glu-cose control has been considered controversial (1, 4, 5). Notably, a recent study using the continuous glucose mon-itoring system to monitor swings of blood glucose documented a significant correla-tion between the mean of daily differences of glucose and the severity of injection site lipohypertrophy (6). Few studies have in-vestigated insulin uptake from lipohyper-trophic tissue.

Methods: A multinational, randomised, open-label parallel-group trial in 394 patients with type 2 diabetes on a once or twice daily insulin regimen. Patients were randomised 1 : 1 to BIAsp or IAsp+NPH for 16 weeks. The BIAsp group was treated according to individual needs using BMI as a surrogate index of insulin resistance. Subjects administered BIAsp 70 (BMI 30 kg/m(2)) with breakfast and lunch and BIAsp 30 with dinner. The IAsp + NPH group injected IAsp at meals and NPH at bedtime as basal insulin. HbA(lc) levels after 16 weeks were compared between treatments using a predefined non-inferiority criterion of 0. 4 %. The incidence of BIAsp was non-inferior to that obtained by the IAsp+NPH (intention to treat [ITT]) population: diff, HbA(lc) - 0. 05 %; 95 % CI (- 0. 24; 0. 14); per protocol (PP) population: diff, HbA(lc) - 0. 03 %; 95 % CI (- 0. 23; 0. 16). Similar improvements in glycaemic control in both groups were confirmed by self-measured 8 -point plasma glucose (PG) profiles, average and fasting PG concentrations, and average prandial PG increments. The incidence of adverse events and hypoglycaemic episodes was similar in the two treatment groups.

One of the principal aims of treatment in patients with diabetes is the prevention of diabetic complications, including cardiovascular disease. There is some evidence, although controversial, that attainment of good glycemic control reduces long-term cardiovascular risk in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the potential cardiovascular safety of the different available preparations of basal insulin. Current basal insulin (neutral protamine Hagedorn [NPH], or <b>isophane)</b> and basal <b>insulin</b> analogs (glargine, detemir, and the more recent degludec) differ essentially by various measures of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects in the bloodstream, presence and persistence of peak action, and within-subject variability in the glucose-lowering response. The currently available data show that basal insulin analogs have a lower risk of hypoglycemia than NPH human insulin, in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, then excluding additional harmful effects on the cardiovascular system mediated by activation of the adrenergic system. Given that no biological rationale for a possible difference in cardiovascular effect of basal insulins has been proposed so far, available meta-analyses of publicly disclosed randomized controlled trials do not show any signal of increased risk of major cardiovascular events between the different basal insulin analogs. However, the number of available cardiovascular events in these trials is very small, preventing any clear-cut conclusion. The results of an ongoing clinical trial comparing glargine and degludec with regard to cardiovascular safety will provide definitive evidence.

40|$|Background: Attaining optimal glucose {{control in}} type 2 {{diabetes}} (T 2 DM) is essential to minimise complications, but difficult to achieve in practice with declining β-cell function in patients. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of a protocol-led, treat-to-target approach emphasising earlier oral hypoglycaemic agent (OHA) combination and insulin use to target basal and prandial glucose in primary care. Methods: T 2 DM patients aged 40 - 75 years, with glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1 C) 6. 4 - 10. 0 % on diet or oral monotherapy in 7 practices were asked {{to participate in a}} protocol-led, target-driven programme of care using early OHA and insulin therapy combinations to target basal and prandial glucose. Recruited patients were randomised to pre-specified algorithms with monthly therapy adjustment aiming for fasting plasma glucose values (FPG) < 6 mmol/L and 2 -hour post-prandial (PPG) < 8 mmol/L. <b>Isophane</b> or humalog <b>insulin</b> was added where glucose targets were not attained. All patients were reviewed at one year. Glucose, weight and cardiovascular (CVS) risk factor outcomes were measured and the feasibility, acceptability and safety of the programme evaluated with validated questionnaires. Results: 345 patients were studied. 60 participated in the glucose study and 285 received standard care. 65 % of recruited patients were male, with mean (SD) age 61. 0 (8. 2) years, BMI 29. 8 (5. 3) kg/m 2, HbA 1 C 7. 5 (0. 9) % and median (IQR) T 2 DM duration 3 (1 - 5) years. 41 completed the study. Glucose control was significantly improved in recruited compared to non-recruited patients with a mean overall 0. 8 % HbA 1 C reduction and 72 % patients achieving HbA 1 C < 7 % and 64 % < 6. 5 % at 1 year. Therapy use was also significantly increased with 50 % requiring 3 therapies, 30 % 2 and 10 % monotherapy. 24 (59 %) of recruited patients received isophane and 16 (39 %) humalog to achieve targets. Glucose optimisation was achieved without significant hypoglycaemia or adverse events and patient quality of life (QoL) and therapy satisfaction remained high. CVS risk was reduced in recruited patients. Conclusions: A more structured, target-driven approach to glucose optimisation can successfully achieve normoglycaemia in a selected primary care T 2 DM population without significant adverse events, hypoglycaemia. or QoL impairment in patients. A principal barrier to wider implementation of this programme appears to be practice and patient participation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin analog that mimics normal basal insulin {{secretion}} without pronounced peaks. The aim of {{this study}} was to compare insulin glargine with <b>isophane</b> <b>insulin</b> (NPH insulin) for basal insulin supply in patients with type 1 diabetes. Methods. A total of 48 type 1 diabetics on long term conventional intensive insulin therapy (IIT) were randomized to three different regimens of basal insulin substitution: 1. continuation of NPH insulin once daily at bedtime with more intensive selfmonitoring (n = 15); 2. NPH insulin twice daily (n = 15); 3. insulin glargine once daily (n = 18). Meal time insulin aspart was continued in all groups. Results. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) was lower in the glargine group (7. 30 ± 0. 98 mmol/l) than in the twice daily NPH group (7. 47 ± 1. 06 mmol/l), but without significant difference. FBG was significantly higher in the once daily NPH group (8. 44 ± 0. 85 mmol/l; p < 0. 05). HbA 1 c after 3 months did not change in the once daily NPH group, but decreased in the glargine group (from 7. 72 ± 0. 86 % to 6. 87 ± 0. 50 %), as well as in the twice daily NPH group (from 7. 80 ± 0. 83 % to 7. 01 ± 0. 63 %). Total daily insulin doses were similar in all groups but only in the glargine group there was an increase of basal and decrease of meal related insulin doses. The frequency of mild hypoglycemia was significantly lower in the glargine group (6. 56 ± 2. 09) than in both NPH groups (9. 0 ± 1. 65 in twice daily NPH group and 8. 13 ± 1. 30 in other NPH group) (episodes/patients-month, p < 0. 05). Conclusion. Basal insulin supplementation in type 1 diabetes mellitus with either twice daily NPH insulin or glargine can result in similar glycemic control when combined with meal time insulin aspart. However, with glargine regimen FBG, HbA 1 c and frequency of hypoglycemic event are lower.

40|$|AIMS: The long {{duration}} of action of soluble insulin {{given in the}} evening could contribute to the high prevalence of nocturnal hypoglycaemia seen in young children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 DM). We examined whether replacing soluble insulin with insulin lispro reduced this risk in children on a three times daily insulin regimen. METHODS: Open crossover study comparing insulin lispro vs. soluble insulin in 23 (16 boys) prepubertal children (age 7 - 11 years) with T 1 DM on three injections/day; long-acting <b>isophane</b> <b>insulin</b> remained identical. At {{the end of each}} 4 -month treatment arm, an overnight 15 -min venous sampled blood glucose profile was performed. RESULTS: Despite similar blood glucose levels pre-evening meal (lispro vs. soluble: mean +/- se 6. 5 +/- 1. 0 vs. 7. 1 +/- 1. 1 mmol/l, P = 0. 5), post-meal (18. 00 - 22. 00 h) blood glucose levels were lower on insulin lispro (area under curve 138 +/- 12 vs. 170 +/- 13 mmol min- 1 l- 1, P = 0. 03). In contrast, in the early night (22. 00 - 04. 00 h) the prevalence of low blood glucose levels (< 3. 5 mmol/l) was lower on lispro (8 % of blood glucose levels) than on soluble insulin (13 %, P = 0. 01). In the early morning (04. 00 - 07. 00 h) mean blood glucose and prevalence of low levels were no different between the two treatment groups, and fasting (07. 00 h) blood glucose levels were similar (6. 1 +/- 0. 8 vs. 6. 3 +/- 0. 9 mmol/l, P = 0. 8). At the end of each treatment arm there were no differences in HbA 1 c (lispro vs. soluble 8. 6 % vs. 8. 4 %, P = 0. 3), or in insulin doses (mean, range 0. 97, 0. 68 - 1. 26 vs. 0. 96, 0. 53 - 1. 22 U/kg per day, P = 0. 2). CONCLUSIONS: The shorter {{duration of}} action of insulin lispro given before the evening meal may reduce the prevalence of early nocturnal hypoglycaemia without compromising HbA 1 c in young children with T 1 DM...|$|E
40|$|The fall in insulin {{sensitivity}} {{during adolescence}} is accentuated in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) {{and has been}} linked to enhanced growth hormone (GH) secretion. The rise in GH release is related to low insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels and low IGF bioactivity. Abnormalities of the IGF binding proteins (IGFBP's), including low insulin-like growth factor binding protein- 3 (IGFBP- 3) and elevated insulin-like growth factor binding protein- 1 (IGFBP- 1) concentrations are also observed. The rise in GH concentrations may lead to increased insulin requirements that cannot easily be met by current treatment regimens and can result in deteriorating blood glucose control. GH release also enhances ketogenesis and {{has been linked to}} the development of microvascular complications. The impact of a subcutaneous injection of rhIGF-I (40 mug/kg) on GH concentrations, insulin sensitivity and the IGFBP's was studied in adolescents with IDDM (n= 17). A control night was compared with a night when rhIGF-I was administered at 18. 00 h. Blood samples were taken regularly overnight and glucose concentrations controlled by a variable-rate insulin infusion. GH concentrations on the control night correlated with glycated haemoglobin levels. The administration of rhIGF-I led to a sustained increase in IGF-I levels, IGF bioactivity and reductions in GH secretion and the insulin infusion requirements to maintain euglycaemia. The change in GH secretion was due to reduced pulse amplitude rather than pulse frequency. The attributes assessing GH release correlated with free insulin concentations on control and rhIGF-I nights, and the reduction in GH release was related to the fall in insulin levels. The concentrations of IGFBP- 3 did not fall after rhIGF-I as they did during the control study, but IGFBP- 1 levels were unchanged. In longer term studies (n= 6), daily rhIGF-I administration (40 ug/kg) for one month led to a reduced <b>isophane</b> <b>insulin</b> dose and a fall in glycated haemoglobin concentrations. GH levels were reduced and IGFBP- 3 concentrations rose in 5 of the 6 subjects studied. The administration of rhIGF-I may have a therapeutic role in IDDM during adolescence by reducing GH concentrations and increasing insulin sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Aims. To study {{influence}} of combined treatment with human insulin analogues (insulin aspart and insulin detemir) on glycemic control, insulin resistance {{and development of}} ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) and frequent hypoglycemic events in comparison with that of human insulins (soluble and isophane). Materials and methods. 54 patients (mean age 61. 2 ± 0. 7) with T 2 DM and IHD participated in this study. All included patients experienced frequent mild and moderate hypoglycemic events (3 + episodes per week). We analyzed frequency and severity of hypoglycemia, parameters of glycemic and lipid metabolism, number of ischaemic episodes per day, duration and depth of ST depression, circadian index, incidence {{of different types of}} arrhythmia and conduction abnormalities as measured by Holter ECG monitoring. All patients were subdivided into two groups by random sampling: 21 patient (first group) carried on with human soluble insulin and isophane in an optimized basal-bolus regimen. In 33 patients, comprising second group, treatment was changed for combination of insulin aspart (NovoRapid®, Novo Nordisk, Denmark) and insulin detemir (Levemir®, Novo Nordisk, Denmark). Follow-up period was set to 6 months. Results. In patients with frequent hypoglycemic experience different types of arrhythmia and heart conduction abnormalities were observed in 75. 9 % of cases. Most patients had complex types of arrhythmic disorders (70. 4 %) with ventricular extrasystole being the most common one. Signs of myocardial ischaemia were registered in 48. 1 % of patients. After 6 months of follow-up patients from the second group demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in fasting and postprandial levels of glycemia (p= 0. 000001). Both groups also had a significantly lower rate of hypoglycemic events. Moreover, in the second group all episodes of hypoglycemia were mild and occurred only in 36. 4 % of cases. Additionally, after 6 months of treatment with human insulin analogues ventricular extrasystoles were registered only in 24. 2 % of patients, while rate and duration of ischaemic episodes dropped to 4. 25 ± 1. 51 (p= 0. 012, comparing with first group). Conclusion. Treatment with human insulin analogues NovoRapid® and Levemir® is associated with 1. 6 % decrease in HbA 1 c levels. Mild hypoglycemia was 72. 2 % less frequent, as compared with rates in the group on human soluble and <b>isophane</b> <b>insulin,</b> while moderate and severe hypoglycemic events were not observed at all. In turn, decrease in frequency and severity of hypoglycemia was associated with substantial improvement in cardiovascular status due to lower number and duration of ischaemic episodes (including painless variant) and lower frequency of heart rhythm disorders...|$|E
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a common}} metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels resulting from an insulin deficiency (type 1 diabetes mellitus) {{or a combination of}} insulin deficiency and insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes mellitus). The chronic hyperglycemia associated with diabetes mellitus can cause damage to the eyes, kidneys, heart and peripheral circulation, resulting in substantial morbidity, premature mortality and considerable healthcare costs. In both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, quality of glycemic control {{has been shown to be}} a major factor in the prevention of microvascular complications, and tight blood glucose control is the primary goal for all patients with diabetes mellitus. In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, multiple daily injections of exogenous insulin and frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels are required to achieve tight glycemic control. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus may achieve initial glycemic control with diet and lifestyle interventions alone; however, a large percentage of patients will require pharmacological therapy, first with an oral antidiabetic agent and, ultimately, with insulin. Premixed insulin formulations, consisting of fixed ratios of short- and intermediate-acting insulins, are a convenient and effective treatment option which account for _ 40 % of insulin use worldwide. Until recently, the only premixed formulations available contained varying proportions of human regular insulin and human <b>isophane</b> <b>insulin</b> suspension (NPH). However, new premixed formulations containing insulin lispro (a rapid-acting insulin analog) and insulin lispro neutral protamine suspension (NPL) [an intermediate-acting insulin analog] are now available. Insulin lispro mix 75 / 25 (Humalog(R) Mix 75 / 25 (TM)) is a premixed formulation containing 25 % insulin lispro and 75 % NPL which has been investigated for use in patients with type 1 and with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Administered twice daily immediately before breakfast and dinner, insulin lispro mix 75 / 25 provides better control of postprandial blood glucose, provides similar overall glycemic control, appears to be preferred by patients and may reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with a similar premixed formulation containing 30 % human regular insulin and 70 % NPH (human insulin 70 / 30; Humulin(R) 70 / 30, Novolin(R) 70 / 30). Insulin lispro mix 75 / 25 has a rapid onset of action, allowing for administration immediately before a meal, whereas patients need to administer human insulin 70 / 30 30 to 60 minutes prior to meals. Insulin lispro mix 75 / 25 also improves glycemic control in patients whose type 2 diabetes mellitus is not well controlled by oral agents. Conclusion: Insulin lispro mix 75 / 25 is suitable for patients wishing to use premixed insulin formulations and may offer several benefits over human insulin 70 / 30.
