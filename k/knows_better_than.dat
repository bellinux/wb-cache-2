25|$|The {{two major}} Chinese {{philosophical}} schools discussed below, Confucianism and Legalism, strongly influenced {{the idea of}} law in China. Briefly, under Confucianism, the state should lead the people with virtue and thus {{create a sense of}} shame which will prevent bad conduct. Under Legalism, law is to be publicly promulgated standards of conduct backed by state coercion. The tension between these two systems is that Confucianism relies on tradition to make the leader the head of household of all China, while Legalism makes standard law that even the emperor should be bound by. The common factor is that both endorse to different degrees a paternalistic conception of the state, which <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> its citizens and makes laws to protect them. This concept persisted throughout the imperial period, into the republican period, and can still be seen acting today.|$|E
500|$|Penelope's story uses {{simple and}} {{deliberately}} naive prose. The tone {{is described as}} casual, wandering, and street-wise with Atwood's dry humour and characteristic bittersweet and melancholic feminist voice. The book uses the first-person narrative, though Penelope sometimes addresses the reader through the second person pronoun. One reviewer noted that Penelope is portrayed as [...] "an intelligent woman who <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> to exhibit her intelligence". Because she contrasts past events as they occurred from her perspective with the elaborations of Odysseus and with what is recorded in myths today, she {{is described as a}} metafictional narrator.|$|E

Before it happens you have all kinds of notions about how wonderful celebrity is and how much joy it's going to bring you. Then you arrive... Look like this you're gonna be happy. Drive this car you're gonna be popular. Wear these clothes and people are gonna wanna fuck you. It's a very powerful illusion and people are caught up in it, including myself. Or I was." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{performances}} of several cast members {{was a frequent}} topic in the critiques. In particular, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior {{to the rest of}} the cast; [...] "Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano." [...] Similarly, The New Yorker Anthony Lane proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights—alongside Downey. The Village Voice Karina Longworth concluded: [...] "Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> to draw attention to himself." [...] Travers asserted that the actor resonated a [...] "scruffy warmth and humor" [...] vibe, while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and Eric Bana in playing the character. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses.)" ...|$|E

[...] – the lyrics develop into what Rikky Rooksby of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna {{states is a}} complaint about modern-day life. She also questions the shallowness of modern life and the [...] "American dream." [...] "I know it sounds clichéd," [...] she admitted. [...] "But I've had 20 years of fame and fortune, and I feel that I {{have the right to}} an opinion on what it is and isn't. All everyone is obsessed about now is being a celebrity. I'm saying that's bullshit, and who <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> me? Before it happens, you have all kinds of notions about how wonderful celebrity is and how much joy it's going to bring you. Then you arrive... In America, more than any other place in the world, you have the freedom to be anything you want to be. Which is all well and good, but it only works if you have a value system – and we seem not to have one anymore. It's, 'Whatever it takes to get to the top, that's what you gotta do.' It's the allure of the beautiful life: 'Look like this, you're gonna be happy. Drive this car, you're gonna be popular. Wear these clothes and people are gonna want to fuck you.' It's a very powerful illusion and people are caught up in it, including myself. Or I was." ...|$|E

2500|$|Slowly Vernet {{attracted}} {{notice in}} the artistic milieu of Rome. With a certain conventionality in design, proper to his day, he allied the results of constant and honest observation of natural effects of atmosphere, which he rendered with unusual pictorial art. Perhaps no painter of landscapes or sea-pieces has ever made the human figure so completely {{a part of the}} scene depicted or so important a factor in his design. In this respect he was heavily influenced by Giovanni Paolo Panini, whom he probably met and worked with in Rome. Vernet's work draws on natural themes, but {{in a way that is}} neither sentimental or emotive. The overall effect of his style is wholly decorative. [...] "Others may know better", he said, with just pride, [...] "how to paint the sky, the earth, the ocean; no one <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> I how to paint a picture". His style remained relatively static throughout his life. His works' attentiveness to atmospheric effects is combined with a sense of harmony that is reminiscent of Claude Lorrain.|$|E
2500|$|Marcus took {{a four-day}} public holiday at Alsium, a resort {{town on the}} Etrurian coast. He was too anxious to relax. Writing to Fronto, he {{declared}} {{that he would not}} speak about his holiday. Fronto replied ironically: [...] "What? Do I not know that you went to Alsium with the intention of devoting yourself to games, joking and complete leisure for four whole days?" [...] He encouraged Marcus to rest, calling on the example of his predecessors (Pius had enjoyed exercise in the palaestra, fishing, and comedy), {{going so far as to}} write up a fable about the gods' division of the day between morning and evening—Marcus had apparently been spending most of his evenings on judicial matters instead of at leisure. Marcus could not take Fronto's advice. [...] "I have duties hanging over me that can hardly be begged off," [...] he wrote back. Marcus put on Fronto's voice to chastise himself: [...] "'Much good has my advice done you', you will say!" [...] He had rested, and would rest often, but [...] "—this devotion to duty! Who <b>knows</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> you how demanding it is!" ...|$|E
