40|$|A {{history of}} parental divorce {{significantly}} influences young adults’ romantic relationships. To examine {{the mechanism of}} association between parental <b>divorce</b> <b>and</b> the romantic relationships of young adults, 17 university students from <b>divorced</b> families <b>and</b> 251 from intact families {{took part in a}} study to compare their attitudes toward <b>divorce</b> <b>and</b> romantic relationships. The results revealed that compared with students from intact families, those from divorced families reported a less negative image of parents who <b>divorce,</b> <b>and</b> a more understanding attitude toward divorce, should it lead to happiness. Furthermore, for the students from divorced families, the stronger their negative image regarding divorce or parents who <b>divorce,</b> <b>and</b> the less understanding they were regarding divorce, the more they were inclined to control expressions of emotion toward romantic partners. For the students from intact families, however, only weak associations were found between attitudes toward <b>divorce</b> <b>and</b> romantic relationships. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for future research...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Using data of Canadian {{municipalities}} in 1996 and 2001, {{this study}} examined the reciprocal relationships between <b>divorce,</b> single-parenthood, <b>and</b> crime in both time-lag and simultaneous models. In the time-lag model, the reciprocal effects between percent single-parent families and crime were found to be positive <b>and</b> strong, whereas <b>divorce</b> <b>and</b> crime had negative and weaker reciprocal effects. In the simultaneous model, the reciprocal relationship between crime and single-parenthood remained strong, whereas crime had a unidirectional negative effect on divorce. Altogether, these results have revealed three important findings: the relationship between <b>divorce</b> <b>and</b> crime is negative; <b>divorce</b> <b>and</b> single-parenthood have different and opposite relationships with crime; and crime is an important causal factor of these family variables. Therefore, it is important to differentiate the relationships of <b>divorce</b> <b>and</b> single-parenthood with crime. More importantly, the traditional perspective of crime as just an outcome of family disruption may be inadequate, and one should take into consideration the reciprocal effects...|$|R
