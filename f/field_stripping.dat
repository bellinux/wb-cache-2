2500|$|The T44 {{participated in}} a {{competitive}} service rifle competition conducted by the Infantry Board at Fort Benning, Georgia against the Springfield T47 (a modified T25) and the T48, a variant of Fabrique Nationale's FN FAL (from [...] "Fusil Automatique Leger", French for [...] "light automatic rifle"). [...] The T47, which {{did not have a}} bolt roller and performed worse in dust and cold weather tests than both the T44 and the T48, was dropped from consideration in 1953. [...] During 1952–53, testing proved the T48 and the T44 roughly comparable in performance, with the T48 holding an advantage in ease of <b>field</b> <b>stripping</b> and dust resistance, as well as a longer product development lead time. [...] A Newsweek article in July 1953 hinted that the T48/FAL might be selected over the T44. [...] During the winter of 1953–54, both rifles competed in the winter rifle trials at U.S. Army facilities in the Arctic. [...] Springfield Armory engineers, anxious to ensure the selection of the T44, had been specially preparing and modifying the test T44 rifles for weeks with the aid of the armory's cold chamber, including redesign of the T44 gas regulator and custom modifications to magazines and other parts to reduce friction and seizing in extreme cold. [...] The T48 rifles received no such special preparation, and in the continued cold weather testing began to experience sluggish gas system functioning, aggravated by the T48's close-fitting surfaces between bolt and carrier, and carrier and receiver. [...] FN engineers opened the gas ports in an attempt to improve functioning, but this caused early/violent extraction and broken parts {{as a result of the}} increased pressures. [...] As a result, the T44 was ranked superior in cold weather operation to the T48. [...] The Arctic Test Board report made it clear that the T48 needed improvement and that the U.S. would not adopt the T48 until it had successfully completed another round of Arctic tests the following winter.|$|E
60|$|During {{the taking}} of the Taku forts he carried scaling ladders at {{the heads of the}} {{storming}} columns and planted them against the walls. He did this, not from a sense of patriotism, but for the invading foreign devils because they paid him a daily wage of fifty cents. He is not frightened by war. He accepts it as he does rain and sunshine, the changing of the seasons, and other natural phenomena. He prepares for it, endures it, and survives it, and when the tide of battle sweeps by, the thunder of the guns still reverberating in the distant canyons, he is seen calmly bending to his usual tasks. Nay, war itself bears fruits whereof he may pick. Before the dead are cold or the burial squads have arrived he is out on the <b>field,</b> <b>stripping</b> the mangled bodies, collecting the shrapnel, and ferreting in the shell holes for slivers and fragments of iron.|$|E

5000|$|The Model 336 is {{designed}} to be easily disassembled for cleaning. Removal of the lever pivot screw with a flathead screwdriver, allows <b>field</b> <b>stripping</b> of the lever arm, bolt, and ejector for maintenance. [...] Unlike many lever action designs, the Model 336 can be cleaned from the breech, much like a bolt-action rifle. [...] This in turn avoids damage to the muzzle caused by cleaning rods and tools.|$|E
50|$|The term ratfucking (rat in {{this case}} is {{shorthand}} for ration) is the unofficial slang term used by soldiers in the U.S. Army to mean the targeted pillaging of MREs (Meals Ready-To-Eat), which the U.S. military calls <b>field</b> <b>stripping.</b> It refers to the process of opening a case of MREs, of which there are twelve in a box, then opening up individual MRE packages, and removing the desired items (generally M&M's and other sweets), and leaving the unenticing remainder.|$|E
50|$|Basic <b>field</b> <b>stripping</b> of the T1 rifle was simple: {{with the}} rifle {{unloaded}} and the mechanism held open, pressing on a stud {{on the underside}} of the crank would lock the breech return spring. The breech block head could then be guided up and out through inclined guide ways in the receiver and the crank then could be freed from the hinge pin, allowing the entire breech mechanism to be removed as a unit. The magazine housing would then be dismounted by pressing forward on the housing until the forward retaining lip would become free from the groove in the forward part of the receiver that it normally rested in and then rotating the housing downward. The entire trigger and feed mechanism group would then be removed by pressing a spring-loaded cross bolt at the rear of the trigger guard just below the stock; the entire assembly would then be freed to be pulled down and rearward to separate it from the receiver and stock. The general concept of the <b>field</b> <b>stripping</b> process is similar to that of the SKS carbine. The stock and barrel-receiver assembly would normally not be separated, following the pattern of rifles such as the German Model 98 Mauser or the Model 1903 Springfield.|$|E

50|$|The {{floating}} chamber {{can become}} fouled and stuck leading to poor feeding. When <b>field</b> <b>stripping</b> the Ace, the recoil spring is removed after removing the slide. The ejector may be removed before removing the barrel and the floating chamber must be aligned vertically {{to remove the}} barrel from the slide. Once the barrel is removed, the floating chamber can be rotated and separated from the main barrel for cleaning. When the extractor is replaced into the barrel, {{the back of the}} extractor should slide into the rear slot of the slide.|$|E
5000|$|Both the AK-47 and the M16 {{have small}} parts and springs {{that need to}} be {{replaced}} every few thousand rounds. However..."Every time (an AK) is disassembled beyond the <b>field</b> <b>stripping</b> stage, it will take some time for some parts to regain their fit, some parts may tend to shake loose and fall out when firing the weapon. Some parts of the AK-47 line are riveted together. Repairing these can be quite a hassle, {{since the end of the}} rivet has to be ground off and a new one set after the part is replaced." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Ruby-type pistol is very {{intuitive}} to operate, {{even for}} novices. The slide stop {{doubles as a}} safety and <b>field</b> <b>stripping</b> is remarkably simple. The small size and large magazine capacity was an advantage, making it a popular [...] "backup" [...] weapon for troops involved in trench warfare, {{as well as the}} standard issue weapons for telephonists, stretcher bearers, machine-gun, machine-rifle, tank, and mortar crews, and rear-echelon personnel of all descriptions. The comparatively weak cartridges these pistols were chambered in gave little recoil, making them easier for novices to use effectively.|$|E
50|$|The P320 was {{designed}} to be ambidextrous in handling, sporting an ambidextrous slide catch lever and user reversible magazine catch. All other operating controls are designed so they can be operated from either side. The firearm can be <b>field</b> <b>stripped</b> with no tools. Additionally, the firearm can also be <b>field</b> <b>stripped</b> without depressing the trigger, an additional safety feature to prevent negligent discharge of the weapon.|$|R

50|$|The Remington Model 51 uses an {{internal}} hammer and features a single-action trigger. A unique combination lever {{on the rear}} of the grip-frame acts as a safety, bolt hold-open device and bolt release. This is in addition to the grip safety, magazine safety disconnect, and relatively heavy trigger pull. The grips are held on with spring-tensioned studs rather than screws. Not a single screw is used in the entire pistol. Pedersen was greatly concerned with human engineering and developing a comfortable grip angle for his pistol while not sacrificing the slim profile. <b>Field</b> <b>stripping</b> the pistol is cumbersome but not overly complicated and is mastered with practice.|$|E
50|$|This {{system had}} some {{advantages}} over the M1 Rifle, including less perceived recoil and greater magazine capacity. Unfortunately, the Johnson's recoiling barrel mechanism resulted in excessive vertical shot dispersion {{that was never}} fully cured during its production life, and was prone to malfunction when a bayonet {{was attached to the}} reciprocating barrel. The Johnson also employed a number of small parts that were easily lost during <b>field</b> <b>stripping.</b> Partially because of lack of development, the M1941 was less rugged and reliable than the M1, though this was a matter of degree and was not universally opined amongst those that had used both weapons in combat.|$|E
5000|$|The U22 Neos is {{designed}} for <b>field</b> <b>stripping</b> without tools into basic modules (barrel with sight rail, receiver, slide and firing pin) for cleaning. The Weaver-style rail incorporates a fully adjustable rear sight and a removable front sight. The grip and trigger guard assembly, made from fiberglass-reinforced [...] "technopolymer," [...] {{is attached to the}} receiver with a single bolt and can easily be removed and replaced with an accessory grip. Unusual for a pistol (but unremarkable in a rifle) the magazine release is above the trigger guard and is operated by a right-handed shooter's trigger finger. The magazine holds ten rounds, giving the Neos a total 10+1 capacity.|$|E

50|$|A {{modified}} version of the Hyde carbine was submitted to the second set of trials on September 11, 1941. Five prototypes were manufactured by Inland (which would later produce M1 Carbines) in conjunction with Bendix. This second version had a total of 60 components, and no longer had a provision for full automatic fire and lacked the pistol grip found on the first model. It also now had a bolt handle directly connected to the bolt. This new version was heavier, at 5.8 pounds with a sling and 5-round magazine. It was overall considered inferior to the first Hyde carbine. Functioning was not as good, <b>field</b> <b>stripping</b> was more difficult, and the barrel was inferior to the original gun.|$|E
50|$|The pistol's toothy surface, and grooved grips, {{provide good}} grip even with wet hands. The K100 also {{features}} ambidextrous controls, supporting both left and right-handed users. When <b>field</b> <b>stripping</b> models made prior to 2012, the forward {{part of the}} trigger guard unlatches from the gripframe and is flexed downward out of the frame. With the forward part of the trigger guard flexed downward, the slide moves farther to the rear than normal and can be pulled to the extreme rear and then lifted up and off the frame. The field strip is roughly similar to the Walther PPK/PPKS fieldstrip except that the triggerguard is not hinged on the K100, instead its polymer construction allows it to flex downward.|$|E
5000|$|The Kimber Warrior and Desert Warrior are {{models that}} are based on a special version of the Custom that was built for the United States Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command. [...] The MARSOC pistol, known as the Kimber ICQB (Interim Close Quarter Battle) pistol, does not have an {{internal}} firing pin block as seen {{on the rest of the}} current Kimber Custom models, hence a [...] "II" [...] does not follow the Warrior or Desert Warrior's names. These pistols have an ambidextrous thumb safety, a lanyard loop, an internal extractor, and, in contrast to other Custom models, a standard length recoil spring guide rod to allow easier <b>field</b> <b>stripping</b> without tools.|$|E
50|$|The gun's {{relative}} lightness {{at approximately}} 27 kg without ammunition {{led to its}} airborne use; a telescopic sight was mounted between the two barrels. Its simple design eased maintenance and enabled its being <b>field</b> <b>stripped</b> in one minute.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{previous}} Tippmann markers, the A-5 is {{very easy}} to field-strip and clean. Tippmann says it can be <b>field</b> <b>stripped</b> in about 60 seconds. This is done by removing four push-pins which hold the tombstone, endcap and grip frame in place.|$|R
