40|$|Program slicing is a {{technique}} for automatically identifying all the lines in a program which affect a selected subset of variables. A large program {{can be divided into}} a number of smaller programs (its slices), each constructed for different variable subsets. The slices are typically simpler than the original program, thereby simplifying the process of testing a property of the program which only concerns a subset of its variables. Some aspects of a program's computation are not captured by a set of variables, rendering slicing inapplicable. To overcome this difficulty we make a program introspective, adding assignments to denote these `implicit' computations. Initially this makes the program longer. However, slicing can now be applied to the <b>introspective</b> <b>program,</b> forming a slice concerned solely with the implicit computation. We improve the simplification power of slicing using program transformation. To illustrate our approach we consider the implicit computation which [...] ...|$|E
