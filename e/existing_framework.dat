5|$|The AEC commissioners {{asked for}} Major General Lauris Norstad, {{the head of}} the Operations and Plans Division, but neither the Chief of Staff of the Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, nor the Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, was willing to release him. The commissioners then {{selected}} McCormack. The job came with a promotion to brigadier general. The commissioners got the kind of officer that they wanted. McCormack was willing to accept the post as a staff job, and took a pragmatic approach to the custody issue. Like most military officers, he was convinced that the men who had to use the nuclear weapons in battle needed to have experience in their proper maintenance, storage and handling. However, he was also aware of the sensitivity of the issue of custody, which Congress had assigned to the AEC. Rather than continue to press for changes in the law, he accepted the situation as it was, and strove {{to make the best of}} it, working within the <b>existing</b> <b>framework.</b>|$|E

25|$|When {{individuals}} assimilate new information, they incorporate it into {{an already}} <b>existing</b> <b>framework</b> without changing that framework. This may occur when individuals' experiences are aligned with their internal representations of the world, but may also occur as a failure to change a faulty understanding; for example, they may not notice events, may misunderstand input from others, or may decide that an event is a fluke and is therefore unimportant as information about the world. In contrast, when individuals' experiences contradict their internal representations, they may change {{their perceptions of the}} experiences to fit their internal representations.|$|E
25|$|The {{meaning and}} origin of many archaic festivals baffled even Rome's {{intellectual}} elite, {{but the more}} obscure they were, the greater the opportunity for reinvention and reinterpretation — a fact lost neither on Augustus in his program of religious reform, which often cloaked autocratic innovation, nor on his only rival as mythmaker of the era, Ovid. In his Fasti, a long-form poem covering Roman holidays from January to June, Ovid presents a unique look at Roman antiquarian lore, popular customs, and religious practice that is by turns imaginative, entertaining, high-minded, and scurrilous; not a priestly account, despite the speaker's pose as a vates or inspired poet-prophet, but a work of description, imagination and poetic etymology that reflects the broad humor and burlesque spirit of such venerable festivals as the Saturnalia, Consualia, and feast of Anna Perenna on the Ides of March, where Ovid treats {{the assassination of the}} newly deified Julius Caesar as utterly incidental to the festivities among the Roman people. But official calendars preserved from different times and places also show a flexibility in omitting or expanding events, indicating that there was no single static and authoritative calendar of required observances. In the later Empire under Christian rule, the new Christian festivals were incorporated into the <b>existing</b> <b>framework</b> of the Roman calendar, alongside {{at least some of the}} traditional festivals.|$|E

500|$|Work on DJ Hero 2 started {{some months}} after the first game was completed, as the {{development}} team had endured heavy working hours to meet the release deadline. [...] FreeStyleGames' creative director Jamie Jackson said that DJ Hero 2 took about seven months to complete. While {{they were able to}} easily build on the <b>existing</b> <b>framework</b> for DJ Hero, FreeStyleGames wanted {{to do more than just}} include new mixes, and sought to include additional features such as the Battle Mixes into the game. [...] Many of the game's new features are a result of feedback from players, including the game's social modes and improvements in the game's interface to provide a cleaner look and instantaneous visual feedback to the player. The team also worked at improving the game's graphics; the appearance of DJ Heros graffiti-based menus gave the impression of being a hip-hop game, but FreeStyleGames wanted to distance DJ Hero 2 from that. They also wanted to clean up the gameplay's interface, providing better feedback to the player and making it easily to tell when they were winning or losing. [...] While DJ Hero 2 does not use Kinect or PlayStation Move motion-sensing technology, Jackson had not ruled them out for a future iteration of the game.|$|E

Although the domain of these applications is very heterogeneous, <b>existing</b> <b>frameworks</b> provide only limited flexibility to integrate diverse groupware applications in a meaningful way. We identify five variation points that a groupware framework needs to offer in a flexible way in order to facilitate the integration of diverse groupware applications. Based on these variation points, we propose a groupware framework called Agilo that tries to overcome the limited flexibility of <b>existing</b> <b>frameworks</b> by offering multiple realizations of these variation points and providing a modular architecture to simplify the integration of applications and the extensibility and adaptability to different application and integration requirements. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Many {{researchers}} have developed frameworks that {{are capable of}} handling context information and can be adapted and used by any Web service. However, no research involving the systematic analysis of <b>existing</b> <b>frameworks</b> has yet been conducted. This paper examines the Context Framework, an example of <b>existing</b> <b>frameworks,</b> using a Petri net, and analyzes its advantages and disadvantages. Then, a Petri net model – with its disadvantages removed- is introduced, and a new framework is presented on the basis of that model. The proposed PAWS (Privacy Aware Web Services) framework has a expandability for context management and communicates flexible context information for every session. The proposed framework can solve overhead problems of context in SOAP messages. It also protects user privacy according to user preferences...|$|R
