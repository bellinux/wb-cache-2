In this paper, the influence of a nonlinear strength envelope is considered in the framework of limit analysis of plasticity. The seismic passive earth pressures on the rigid walls in seismic conditions are estimated using the upper bound theorem of limit analysis in conjunction with the nonlinear <b>failure</b> <b>criterion.</b> A generalized tangential technique, one tangential line to the nonlinear <b>failure</b> <b>criterion,</b> is used to develop the external work and internal energy dissipation. The seismic earth passive pressure is obtained from optimization. An extended Rankine's theory is proposed with the same nonlinear <b>failure</b> <b>criterion.</b> In order to evaluate the validity of the numerical results using the generalized tangential technique, the solutions of seismic passive earth pressure are also presented in the framework of the extended Rankine's theory. Numerical results for different seismic coefficients and various nonlinear parameters of the <b>failure</b> <b>criterion</b> are compared with each other. The upper bound solutions using the generalized tangential technique are almost equal to the extended Rankine's theoretical solutions, with the maximum difference being less than 1 %. The good agreement shows that the generalized tangential technique is an effective method for evaluating the seismic passive earth pressure with a nonlinear <b>failure</b> <b>criterion.</b> This paper extends the work of the seismic passive earth pressure using a linear Mohr-Coulomb <b>failure</b> <b>criterion</b> in previous literature to that using the nonlinear <b>failure</b> <b>criterion.</b> Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} {{the influence of the}} intermediate principal stress on the stress and displacement of surrounding rock, a novel approach based on 3 D Hoek-Brown (H-B) <b>failure</b> <b>criterion</b> was proposed. Taking the strain-softening characteristic of rock mass into account, the potential plastic zone is subdivided into a finite number of concentric annulus and a numerical procedure for calculating the stress and displacement of each annulus was presented. Strains were obtained based on the nonassociated and associated flow rule and 3 D plastic potential function. Stresses were achieved by the stress equilibrium equation and generalized Hoek-Brown <b>failure</b> <b>criterion.</b> Using the proposed approach, we can get the solutions of the stress and displacement of the surrounding rock considering the intermediate principal stress. Moreover, the proposed approach was validated with the published results. Compared with the results based on generalized Hoek-Brown <b>failure</b> <b>criterion,</b> it is shown that the plastic radius calculated by 3 D Hoek-Brown <b>failure</b> <b>criterion</b> is smaller than those solved by generalized H-B <b>failure</b> <b>criterion,</b> and the influences of dilatancy effect on the results based on the generalized H-B <b>failure</b> <b>criterion</b> are greater than those based on 3 D H-B <b>failure</b> <b>criterion.</b> The displacements considering the nonassociated flow rule are smaller than those considering associated flow rules...|$|R
