5|$|Many birds call Adams home or a {{stopover}} {{on their}} migration routes. Songbirds include three species of chickadee, two kinglets, several thrushes, warblers, sparrows, and finches. One unique songbird {{to the high}} elevations is the gray-crowned rosy finch, who can be found far up the mountain, well above the tree line. Raptors {{that live in the}} forest and meadows include Accipiters, red-tailed hawks, golden and bald eagles, ospreys, great horned owls, and falcons. The many snags around the mountain provide forage and nesting habitat for the many species of woodpeckers that live there including the hairy woodpecker, <b>downy</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> and white-headed woodpecker. Jays such as the Steller's jay and gray jay are common and the gray jay is an especially familiar character, as they will boldly investigate campers and hikers. Another familiar character of the higher elevation forests is the Clark's nutcracker with its distinctive call. Swallows and swifts are frequently seen flying just above the water of lakes and some larger streams. Common mergansers and several other species of water birds can be found on many of the lakes as well. The American dipper with its unique way of bobbing about along streams and then ducking into the water is a common sight. Several grouse species, the sooty, spruce, and ruffed grouse and the white-tailed ptarmigan, call the forests and the lower slopes of the mountain home.|$|E

40|$|A Thesis Submitted In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements For the Degree of Master of Science - BiologyDowny {{woodpeckers}} (Picoides pubescens) are small, non-migratory, nonpasserine birds. Non-migratory {{birds that}} overwinter in cold temperate zones {{are exposed to}} energetically costly conditions during winter. These conditions include decreased daytime for foraging, long nights requiring increased periods of fasting, and decreased food availability. These birds will also be exposed to extremely cold temperatures in winter months. To survive these conditions birds must go {{through a process of}} season acclimatization. In birds, seasonal acclimatization has been found to mainly focus on adjustments in metabolic rates such as basal metabolic rates (BMR) and summit metabolic rates (Msum) when under cold stress. Another possible factor in seasonal acclimatization is the substitution of heat produced from locomotive muscle activity for thermoregulatory heat. Despite the impact that metabolic rates have been shown to have on seasonal acclimatization, there has been little research into geographic variation in metabolic rates and ventilation of birds. The {{purpose of this study was}} to observe seasonal variation in metabolic rates and ventilation variables between Wisconsin <b>Downy</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> and South Dakota <b>Downy</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b> A secondary goal of this study was to observe seasonal variation in thermoregulatory substitution in Wisconsin <b>Downy</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b> Open-circuit respirometry was used to measure oxygen consumption (VO 2) and ventilation in seasonally acclimatized <b>Downy</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b> Metabolic rates and ventilation were measured under cold stress using a helox (~ 79 % helium and ~ 21 % oxygen) gas mixture and at thermoneutral zone (TNZ) conditions. Foraging activity was also measured using an infrared camera and a closed-circuit television monitor. During foraging trials activity was measured by time spent foraging on a peanut feeder placed into the metabolic chamber. Heat of activity was measured using a thermocoupler when birds were foraging and when feeders had been removed and birds were at rest. Wisconsin <b>Downy</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> showed a significantly higher BMR and Msum in winter compared to summer. South Dakota <b>Downy</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> had a significantly higher Msum in both summer and winter compared to Wisconsin <b>Downy</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b> Wisconsin <b>Downy</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> had significantly higher EO 2 in the winter compared to summer during both BMR and Msum testing.

60|$|Before sunrise I was out. Soon the jumping {{flight and}} cheery good-morning of a <b>downy</b> <b>woodpecker</b> {{led me to}} an old field with {{scattered}} evergreen clumps. There is no better time for a quiet peep at the birds than the morning after a snow-storm, and no better place than the evergreens.

60|$|Not {{only the}} Indian, but many {{indigenous}} insects, birds, and quadrupeds, welcomed the apple-tree to these shores. The tent-caterpillar saddled her eggs {{on the very}} first twig that was formed, and it has since shared her affections with the wild cherry; and the canker-worm also in a measure abandoned the elm to feed on it. As it grew apace, the bluebird, robin, cherry-bird, king-bird, and many more, came with haste and built their nests and warbled in its boughs, and so became orchard-birds, and multiplied more than ever. It was an era {{in the history of}} their race. The <b>downy</b> <b>woodpecker</b> found such a savory morsel under its bark, that he perforated it in a ring quite round the tree before he left it,--a thing which he had never done before, to my knowledge. It did not take the partridge long to find out how sweet its buds were, and every winter eve she flew, and still flies, from the wood, to pluck them, much to the farmer's sorrow. The rabbit, too, was not slow to learn the taste of its twigs and bark; and when the fruit was ripe, the squirrel half-rolled, half-carried it to his hole; and even the musquash crept up the bank from the brook at evening, and greedily devoured it, until he had worn a path in the grass there; and when it was frozen and thawed, the crow and the jay were glad to taste it occasionally. The owl crept into the first apple-tree that became hollow, and fairly hooted with delight, finding it just the place for him; so, settling down into it, he has remained there ever since.|$|E

40|$|Summary. I {{describe}} an artificial patch {{system that was}} used to study the foraging behavior of free-roaming <b>downy</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> (Pieoides pubescens) in a woodlot in southeas-tern Michigan. The artificial "patches " used were thin logs into which were drilled small holes to hold food items (bits of sunflower seed kernels). <b>Downy</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> would sys-tematically search the holes of a patch for food items and thus by manipulating the food distribution within the patches, the birds could be made to experience differing rates of energy intake while foraging. Simple deterministic theories of optimal foraging in patchy environments indicate that an optimal forager, who experiences a decreasing rate of energy intake while forag-ing in a patch, should leave a patch when its rate of energy intake falls below the average intake rate for the overall environment. In other words, an optimal forager is contin-ually assessing the quality of a patch and makes decisions as to when to leave a patch via its energy intake rate. When the <b>downy</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> studied could encounter any one of several types of patches each with differing, decreasing rates of energy intake, they followed a patch quality assess-ment strategy similar to that suggested by theory. Upon encountering a single type of patch for a number of consec-utive days, however, the birds appeared to forage according to prior expectations of patch quality and not according to a quality assessment s rategy based on energy intake rates. The observed expectations were not related to the number of food items per patch but they appeared to be based on expectations of when or where to leave a patch...|$|R

40|$|Availability of {{the oldest}} age-class of balsam fir (Abies balsamea) forest, the major forest type of western Newfoundland, is declining through logging, insect effects, and {{management}} for a 60 -year harvest rotation. Loss of old-growth balsam fir forests may limit the availability of woodpecker habitat if nesting trees and feeding substrates are most abundant in these later successional stages. We assessed abundance of black-backed <b>woodpeckers</b> (Picoides arcticus), <b>downy</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> (P. pubescens), and hairy woodpeckers (P. villosus) in 10 stands in each of 3 forest age classes (40 - 59, 60 - 79, and > 80 yr) of balsam fir in western Newfoundland. For each stand, we quantified 10 habitat variables that may have influenced habitat use by woodpeckers. Black-backed woodpeckers were almost exclusively found in > 80 -year-old forests. Density of black-backed wood-peckers {{was significantly related to}} number of large snags, but negatively to the total number of dead stems. <b>Downy</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> were common and similarly distributed among the 3 forest age classes, and hairy wood-peckers were uncommon and only observed in the 40 - and 60 -year age classes. <b>Downy</b> and hairy <b>woodpeckers</b> were significantly associated with the number of white birch snags in the stands, a resource that declined with forest age. A reduction in the amount of forest in the oldest age class is probably reducing the population of black-backed woodpeckers in western Newfoundland. We recommend a series of fixed-width transects, coupled with point counts using call broadcasts, as an effective means of surveying woodpeckers. Forest managers must maintain large areas of old forests, temporally and spatially, to maintain black-backed woodpeckers in Newfoundland...|$|R
