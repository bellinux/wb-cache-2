5000|$|The Equipment Leasing {{engages in}} leasing and {{disposing}} containers and chassis. Basically, {{there are five}} types of equipment for leasing, including Dry Freight Containers (for general cargo), Refrigerated Containers (for perishable items), Special Containers (Open Tops and <b>Flat</b> <b>Racks,</b> for heavy and oversized cargo), Tank Containers (for liquid products transporting), and Chassis (for containers transporting). In addition, the company also provides Generator Sets for leasing.|$|R
50|$|TAL International Group, Inc. {{was set up}} in 1963 and now {{is based}} in Purchase, New York, {{marketing}} on intermodal freight equipment leasing and maritime container management services. There are two segments in the company, Equipment Leasing and Equipment Trading. TAL International owns 17 offices in 11 countries and about 230 third party container facilities in 40 countries. As of December 31, 2013, the company’s fleet included 2 million TEU containers, open tops, <b>flat</b> <b>racks,</b> generator sets and chassis.|$|R
5000|$|Out of gauge cargo - Cargo that {{cannot be}} packed {{in the normal}} {{containers}} due to {{that the size of}} cargo exceed the container size length or height or width or all of the above. Such cargo can only be packed in <b>flat</b> <b>rack</b> containers or open top containers (see ISO 6346). They are usually added after planning all other containers and are usually stowed on top of other containers (on deck or in hold) as the planners strive to minimize the number of [...] "killed slots" [...] (unused positions) as much as possible.|$|R
50|$|The LSB overcomes {{limitations}} in width, span, capacity and fatigue that {{is associated with}} many other systems in the RE use The LSB can be built by hand, but where cranes and other mechanical handling equipment are available, they are used to reduces {{the time it takes to}} build and also the number of trained personal needed. Bridge components can be transported using DROPS (NATO) <b>flat</b> <b>racks</b> and ISO shipping containers. The bridge can be constructed by a Royal Engineer Section; when mechanical equipment is used, without it can take up to three sections. Once constructed a LSB tends to remain in situ for far longer periods than either a CSB or a GSB, one bridge in Iraq remained in use for three years. The bridge has a width (roadway) of 4.2m and can be built with sloping or level access ramps depending on the site.|$|R
40|$|The {{emission}} distribution {{characteristics of}} an evaporation source {{can be used}} to define the correct geometry in the vacuum chamber for the production of uniform-thickness coatings. We first measured the thickness of coatings on test pieces positioned at known radial distances on a single rotation <b>flat</b> <b>rack</b> in the vacuum evaporation chamber and used these data in a computer program which found the source emission function, in the form cosQ φ, which provided the best fit to the data. φ is the emission angle of the evaporant stream from the source, measured from the vertical. The known emission function was then used to determine the source offset and calotte curvature which produced the best thickness uniformity over the diameter. In one example, we found Q = 1. 31 for Al 2 O 3 evaporated from an electron beam source. This enabled us to predict a chamber geometry which yielded coatings across a calotte of diameter 81 cm with a thickness variation of +/- 0. 3 %. For Si 02 Q = 1. 70, but the uniformity was less excellent (+/- 3 %) because this material is difficult to evaporate controllably. The technique is a powerful one for anyone setting up his coating chamber to produce a large number of coated substrates...|$|R

50|$|Modules are {{assembled}} into arrays on {{some kind}} of mounting system, which may be classified as ground mount, roof mount or pole mount. For solar parks a large rack is mounted on the ground, and the modules mounted on the rack.For buildings, many different racks have been devised for pitched roofs. For <b>flat</b> roofs, <b>racks,</b> bins and building integrated solutions are used. Solar panel racks mounted on top of poles can be stationary or moving, see Trackers below. Side-of-pole mounts are suitable for situations where a pole has something else mounted at its top, such as a light fixture or an antenna. Pole mounting raises what would otherwise be a ground mounted array above weed shadows and livestock, and may satisfy electrical code requirements regarding inaccessibility of exposed wiring. Pole mounted panels are open to more cooling air on their underside, which increases performance. A multiplicity of pole top racks can be formed into a parking carport or other shade structure. A rack which does not follow the sun from left to right may allow seasonal adjustment up or down.|$|R
5000|$|Tiran-6 - Modernization of ex-Syrian T-62. Fitted with a laser {{rangefinder}} and thermal imaging sight for the gunner. The tank was {{fitted with a}} US-made radio. Some Tiran-6s have [...] "Blazer" [...] reactive armour tiles fitted to the hull and turret. The original engine {{was replaced by a}} General Motors 8V-71T diesel engine. Tiran-6s have a <b>flat</b> plate bustle <b>rack</b> added to the turret rear, two stowage bins (one on the right of the turret and other one on the rear of the turret), a larger headlight bracket on the glacis plate and pintle mounts for machine guns on the turret roof in front of each hatch. The original 115 mm tank gun was replaced by a 105 mm tank gun. The 12.7 mm DShK 1938/46 antiaircraft heavy machine gun was replaced by an M1919 Browning light machine gun. The M2 Browning heavy machine gun was mounted on top of the mantlet of the main gun.|$|R
40|$|Group {{exhibition}} {{curated by}} Geraint Evans. Artists include: Paul Housley, Jake Clark, Laura White, Martin Newth and Michael Samuels. This exhibition considers the material culture of suburbia. The suburbs are an indisputable site of consumption {{driven by an}} ever more pervasive shopping economy. Flat pack furniture, collections of porcelain ornaments, Chamois leather, tidy gardens and garden sheds describe a form of aspiration and perceived conformity. And yet there is creativity within suburbia, as Roger Silverstone writes: “The shared products of contemporary material and symbolic culture are chosen or discarded, arranged and rearranged according to desire, itself structured by class or ethnicity. Suburban streets are complex and subtle signifiers, offering, {{for those who can}} read the signs, delicate statements of style and status. ” (Silverstone, 1997 p. 6 / 7) Michael Samuels’ practice can be characterised as a form of contemporary bricolage, which utlises industrially produced Modernist furniture. Elements such as cabinets, tables and sideboards are liberated from their traditional role, cut up and reconfigured into structures that no longer have a utilitarian purpose. Laura White is interested in our relationship and negotiation with the 'stuff' of the world, from the first-hand encounters with objects and matter to the mediated experience of images, such as those found in books, on posters and the internet. Martin Newth’s work tracks the historical roots of the photographic process and raises questions about the aesthetics of the medium. For ‘Shed’ a typical garden shed was converted into a camera obscura by inserting a simple uncut spectacle lens into the door. Paul Housley works and reworks his paintings, referencing art history whilst seeking to reinvent it. Urgent, immediate depictions of domestic ornaments, broken prams, piles of skulls and a plethora of other images emerge from the layers, traces, lumps and marks of restless making. Jake Clark’s paintings depict the houses, people and belongings of British and European seaside suburbia. In ‘Low Rise’, an essential possession of many suburban homes - the <b>flat</b> pack cd <b>rack</b> – is painted in an overly optimistic tone. The inverted reference to J G Ballard’s ‘High Rise’, the sickly palette and splatters of paint undermine this symbol of domestic order. The Flat Pack Sessions is part of Wimbledon College of Arts paintingresearch’s yearly thematic: Punk in the Suburbs...|$|R
