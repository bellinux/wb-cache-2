500|$|Liu Xia {{was under}} house-arrest almost {{immediately}} after the announcement, and was escorted to Liaoning to visit her imprisoned husband. She reported that she was denied visitors, her telephones were repeatedly down, and complained that even her elderly mother {{had not been able}} to get through to her. Visitors were denied entrance to her residential compound, including Norwegian diplomats who had tried to visit her on 12 October; she was able to send out a few messages through Twitter. Chinese police stationed there cordoned off the area. Thus, journalists and well-wishers were kept at bay for several hours after the announcement; as she was being taken away to see her husband, Reuters heard her say [...] "they are <b>forcing</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> leave Beijing". Dissident groups reported on 18 October that numerous supporters and associates of Liu may have been detained by police—that Tiananmen Mother Ding Zilin, and her husband Jiang Peikun, had not been seen or heard of for four days, and that their phones were cut off. Writer Jiang Qisheng went missing just days after the Nobel announcement.|$|E
2500|$|The Weilüe {{recorded}} {{more details}} of the events leading to Cui Yan's death. It mentioned that Cui Yan's letter to Yang Xun fell {{into the hands of}} Cui Yan's enemies, who accused him of defaming Cao Cao. Cao Cao felt that Cui Yan was discrediting him so he had the latter arrested, imprisoned, head shaved, and sent to perform hard labour. Later, Cui Yan's enemies told Cao Cao, [...] "When Cui Yan serves his sentence, he glares at people straight in the eye as if he is filled with resentment." [...] Cao Cao believed them and wanted Cui Yan to die so he sent an official to inform Cui, [...] "You've three days to live." [...] Cui Yan did not understand what the official meant and he continued to live on for several days. When the official reported to Cao Cao that Cui Yan was alive and well, Cao furiously said, [...] "Cui Yan is <b>forcing</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> use the sword on him!" [...] The official went to see Cui Yan again and explained to the latter that Cao Cao actually wanted him to kill himself within three days. Cui Yan said, [...] "How silly of me. I didn't know that he actually wanted me to do this." [...] He committed suicide after that.|$|E
2500|$|Around 222, {{at the age}} of 24, Sun Huan was {{commissioned}} as General of the Household Who Pacifies the East (安東中郎將) and ordered to join Sun Quan's general Lu Xun at the Battle of Xiaoting against Liu Bei, who launched a campaign against Sun Quan to retake Jing Province. During the preliminary stages of the battle, Sun Huan led a separate force to attack Liu Bei's vanguard force at Yidao (夷道) but ended up being besieged by the enemy. He requested for reinforcements from Lu Xun but was denied. When the other officers urged Lu Xun to help Sun Huan, Lu declined, saying that Sun Huan was capable of holding his ground and that the siege would automatically be lifted later. Sun Quan's forces eventually inflicted a devastating defeat on Liu Bei's forces at the Battle of Xiaoting. As Lu Xun predicted, the siege on Yidao was lifted, after which Sun Huan led troops to block Liu Bei's retreat route, but Liu managed to escape by travelling across the mountainous areas. Liu Bei later remarked, [...] "(Sun) Huan was still a child when I visited Jing, but now he is <b>forcing</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> this extent!" [...] After the battle, Sun Huan came to see Lu Xun and he told the latter, [...] "Earlier on, I was indeed very resentful when you refused to help me. But now, after the victory, I see that you have your own style of despatching the troops." ...|$|E

60|$|Then, suddenly, Darius {{pulled me}} {{back by the}} coat-collar, <b>forcing</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> run with him, and as we went swiftly past our guns toward the rear, I asked what he was doing.|$|E

60|$|All this I said like a peevish child, and {{no sooner}} had I ceased {{speaking}} than Darius seized me by the shoulder, <b>forcing</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> turn until I had a {{full view of the}} newcomer.|$|E

60|$|An {{officer and}} a slave entered the very room in which I hid, <b>forcing</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> flatten myself to one side in the {{darkness}} until they had passed. Then the slave made a light, and I knew that I must find another hiding place.|$|E

60|$|But Rubens, the great, joyous, full-souled, all-powerful Rubens!--there he was, full as ever of triumphant, abounding life; disgusting and pleasing; {{making me}} laugh and making me angry; defying me to dislike him; {{dragging}} me at his chariot wheels; in despite of my protests <b>forcing</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> confess {{that there was}} no other but he.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought then}} that I might gain some {{pleasure}} by provoking you to anger; and our fight was the result.

6000|$|... ‘St. Ives!’ he cried, ‘why do {{you make}} it so hard for me? and where’s the use of {{insulting}} other people? The plain English is, that I can’t hear of any proposal of marriage from a man under a charge like that. You must see it for yourself, man! It’s the most absurd thing I ever heard of!

60|$|I was {{something}} dissatisfied with my daughter--not for letting Mr. Franklin kiss her; Mr. Franklin was welcome to THAT--but for <b>forcing</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tell her foolish story at second hand.
