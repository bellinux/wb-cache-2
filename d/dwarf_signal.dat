50|$|In some {{situations}} or places, {{such as in}} tunnels, where there is insufficient room for a post or gantry, signals may be mounted at ground level. Such signals may be physically smaller (termed <b>dwarf</b> <b>signals).</b> Rapid transit systems commonly use nothing but <b>dwarf</b> <b>signals</b> due to the restricted space. In many systems, <b>dwarf</b> <b>signals</b> are only used to display 'restrictive' aspects such as low speed or shunt aspects, and do not normally indicate 'running' aspects.|$|R

5000|$|A {{standard}} {{high position}} light {{consists of two}} heads; the bottom head can remain dark unless it is needed. In addition to the high position light signals the PRR developed a dwarf position light, as with many railroads, these <b>dwarf</b> <b>signals</b> are {{also referred to as}} a [...] "pot," [...] a tradition carried over from the 19th century revolving [...] "Pot Type Signal." [...] Four plain white lamps are able to display four low-speed aspects each with two lamps. In 1930, close clearances of the Philadelphia Suburban Station complex spurred development of the pedestal-type position, which consisted of two position <b>dwarf</b> <b>signals</b> in a common cast backing.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} types of <b>dwarf</b> <b>signals,</b> called [...] "Main Dwarf signals" [...] (Huvuddvärgsignal) used as stand-ins for home signals in {{stations}} with lot of shunting or {{where there are}} a lot of switches that needs a signal.|$|R
50|$|Signals {{like the}} model N/N-2 {{could also be}} mounted {{directly}} {{on the ground as}} a <b>dwarf</b> <b>signal</b> without a backing. The most notable user of this type of signal was the Chesapeake and Ohio, but units could be found on railroads all over the country.|$|E
50|$|The rail {{was removed}} in 2003-2004, {{and ended up}} at the Yarra Valley Tourist Railway, with all {{overhead}} wiring on the siding gone by this time. A <b>dwarf</b> <b>signal</b> and overhead wiring stanchions remain in the paper mill grounds themselves. The paper mill was closed in 2012.|$|E
5000|$|Dwarf {{signals are}} {{typically}} {{mounted on the}} ground in areas of low speed movements or restricted clearances. Dwarf signals may be sometimes mounted higher up on a small mast or other structure for improved visibility. These can be known as [...] "high dwarfs" [...] or [...] "stick signals," [...] but a tall mounting does not change the lower speed applications of the <b>dwarf</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another type of <b>signals</b> are <b>dwarf</b> <b>signals,</b> {{which are}} often used at {{switches}} to allow for occasional movements against the usual direction of train traffic. Controlled manually from a tower, they {{are not part of}} ordinary operations, and they generally do not include trip arms.|$|R
50|$|In Switzerland, {{shunting}} manoeuvres can {{be controlled}} either by shunting <b>signals</b> or <b>dwarf</b> <b>signals.</b> The maximum speed allowed for shunting is 30 km/h. This can be increased in special cases to 40 km/h. In any case speed must be compatible with visibility, local conditions and braking power.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{low speed}} aspect {{indicated}} by a lunar-white position-light signal mounted below the main head. It shows two lunar-white lights at 45 degrees (to mimic an upper-quadrant semaphore) to indicate proceed at low speed. These position light signals are also used for <b>dwarf</b> <b>signals</b> {{and in this case}} they can also display 'stop' as a red light and lunar-white light in a horizontal row.|$|R
50|$|Dwarf {{signals are}} usually {{positioned}} {{on the left}} of the tracks and only apply to that track. In case it is positioned on the right hand side of the track it has an illuminated indicator (arrow) to make clear for which track it is valid. They are set to allow the passage of trains as well as the standard light signals for mainline movements. The last <b>dwarf</b> <b>signal</b> before entering the main line will show a Proceed aspect for a train or a Proceed with caution aspect for a shunting movement.|$|E
5000|$|Dwarf {{signals are}} smaller signals used in low speed or {{restricted}} clearance areas. Most signaling aspect systems have a parallel set of aspects {{for use with}} dwarf signals that differ from aspects used in high signals. Dwarf signals may have multiple heads just like a high signal, but sometimes dwarf signals use so-called [...] "virtual heads" [...] to save on space and cost. This is where a <b>dwarf</b> <b>signal</b> displays multiple lamps on what would ordinarily be a single signal head creating the effect of multiple signal heads. For example, a stack of dwarf lamps in the order Yellow/Red/Green can display plain Yellow, Red and Green as well as Yellow over Green and Red over Green.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is also a}} Low speed aspect for calling-on, {{shunting}} or {{entering a}} low speed area such as a goods siding. This is indicated by a small yellow light beneath the two main lights, i.e. Red-over-Red-over-Yellow. <b>Dwarf</b> <b>signals</b> are also used to show Low speed aspects. These were originally upper quadrant disc signals but are now all of the colour light or searchlight variety. The aspects (and indications) are: ...|$|R
50|$|Signals {{are divided}} into Permissive and Absolute signals. Absolute signals cannot be passed at Stop without {{permission}} from the signaller or controller, whereas Permissive signals at Stop can be passed after having stopped for a one-minute waiting period. Absolute signals can be identified {{by the fact that}} the two lights are vertically aligned, whereas with Permissive signals they are vertically off-set (staggered on different sides of the post). <b>Dwarf</b> <b>signals</b> are always Absolute.|$|R
5000|$|... ground (laaggeplaatst) or <b>dwarf</b> (dwergsein) <b>signal,</b> used {{in areas}} where speeds do not exceed 40 km/h (do not have numeric display) ...|$|R
50|$|Behind {{the signal}} head is placed a dark backing or target, which helps improve signal {{visibility}} in bright ambient lighting. Target designs vary, but are usually round or oval, {{depending on the}} layout of the signal lamps. For each type of signal there are usually a range of target dimensions that can be chosen by the individual railroad company. As <b>dwarf</b> <b>signals</b> are not designed to be seen from long distances, they are not generally equipped with targets.|$|R

25|$|Today's LIRR {{signal system}} {{has evolved from}} its legacy Pennsylvania Railroad-based system. The {{railroad}} utilizes a variety of wayside railroad signals including position light, color light and <b>dwarf</b> <b>signals.</b> In addition, much of the LIRR {{is equipped with a}} bi-directional Pulse code cab signaling called automatic speed control (ASC), though portions of the railway still retain single direction wayside only signalling. Unlike other railroads which began using color light signals in the 20th century, the LIRR did not begin using signals with color lights on its above ground sections until 2006. Some portions of the railway lack automatic signals and cab signals completely, instead train and track car movements are governed only by timetable and verbal/written train orders.|$|R
50|$|Permissive {{signals are}} {{indicated}} by a circular 'P' plate offset below the signal head and Absolute by a square 'A' plate directly below the signal head. As with three-position <b>signalling,</b> <b>dwarf</b> (low speed) <b>signals</b> are always absolute. An 'A' plate in New South Wales or Victoria means the signal is automatic {{and therefore a}} Permissive signal, which is again a source of conflicting meaning between the differing signalling systems.|$|R
50|$|The motor-controlled North American semaphores {{used since}} the advent of the track circuit block system of 1872, {{provided}} a form of automation sought after by the railroads to reduce labor costs and improve reliability over manually operated systems as in the UK, Germany and elsewhere. <b>Dwarf</b> <b>signals</b> were worked mechanically, pneumatically to give restricting-type signals as did mast type signals at interlockings, but motorized dwarfs were more common after the development of the Model 2A signal in 1908. As early as 1915, the technological push by -such intellectual giants as A.H. Rudd of the Pennsylvania R.R. and his concept of speed signalling combined with his development of the Position Light signal and the concurrent color-light signals using William Churchill's doublet lens combination in practical terms made the semaphore technically obsolete.|$|R
5000|$|Over time, {{due to its}} {{low cost}} and versatility, the modular color light signal became the {{standard}} in North America. The first modular system was the GRS Type [...] "D", first marketed in 1922, and adopted by the Southern Railroad along with many others: D&RG, etc. The GRS units used a smaller [...] "background" [...] than the comparable US&S vertical possibly somewhat compromising long range visibility. Today the most popular type of new signal in North America is a modular design manufactured by Safetran, {{as it is the}} cheapest, with all of the four major Class 1 railroads installing it almost exclusively. Today, both GRS and Safetran market separate modular systems for high and <b>dwarf</b> <b>signals,</b> while US&S uses the single modular Style [...] "R-2" [...] design for high and Style N-2 for dwarfs.|$|R
5000|$|A system {{combining}} {{aspects of}} the colour and position systems was developed on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) in 1920 and was patented by L.F. Loree and F.P. Patenall. It {{is similar to the}} position light system with the central light removed and the resulting pairs of lights colored in correspondence to the angle they make: green for the vertical pair, amber for the right diagonal pair, and red for the horizontal pair. An additional pair, colored [...] "lunar white", may be added on the other diagonal for restricting indications. Speed signalling is indicated not by additional signal heads, but by a system of white or amber [...] "orbital" [...] lights placed in one of six positions above and below the main head. The position above or below indicates the current speed, while the left-to-right position indicates the speed at the next signal (full, medium, or slow in both cases). <b>Dwarf</b> <b>signals</b> have the same aspects as full-sized signals. One of the advantages claimed for the system is that burned-out bulbs produce aspects which can be interpreted unambiguously as either the intended indication (for the main head) or as a more restrictive indication (for the orbitals—if only the central head is lit, the indication is either slow or restricting).|$|R

The crew takes Starbug {{to visit the}} Viral Research Centre, where Lanstrom {{had been working on}} a theory that viruses can be positive as well as negative. Lanstrom had successfully isolated several positive viruses, including the [...] "luck virus", which grants whomever contracts it extreme good luck.|$|R
40|$|The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) defines {{new demands}} on data {{analysis}} efforts in its all-sky gravitational wave survey, recording simultaneously thousands of galactic compact object binary foreground sources and tens {{to hundreds of}} background sources like binary black hole mergers and extreme mass ratio inspirals. We approach this problem with an adaptive and fully automatic Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler, able to sample from the joint posterior density function (as established by Bayes theorem) for a given mixture of signals "out of the box'', handling {{the total number of}} signals as an additional unknown parameter beside the unknown parameters of each individual source and the noise floor. We show in examples from the LISA Mock Data Challenge implementing the full response of LISA in its TDI description that this sampler is able to extract monochromatic Double White <b>Dwarf</b> <b>signals</b> out of colored instrumental noise and additional foreground and background noise successfully in a global fitting approach. We introduce 2 examples with fixed number of signals (MCMC sampling), and 1 example with unknown number of signals (RJ-MCMC), the latter further promoting the idea behind an experimental adaptation of the model indicator proposal densities in the main sampling stage. We note that the experienced runtimes and degeneracies in parameter extraction limit the shown examples to the extraction of a low but realistic number of signals.

40|$|The Malling 9 (M. 9) dwarfing {{rootstock}} {{is widely used}} in apple breeding and commercial cultivation to shorten the juvenile period, reduce vegetative growth and increase flowering of the scion. A segment of M. 9 stem (interstock) or M. 9 bark grafted into a compound tree can cause significant dwarfing of the scion, suggesting that the <b>dwarfing</b> <b>signal</b> may be vascular derived. To better understand how the M. 9 rootstock alters the growth {{and development of the}} scion, we compared gene expression in vascular-enriched tissue from dwarfing and vigorous rootstocks. RNA sequencing indicated that key flowering genes were upregulated in M. 9 relative to a vigorous rootstock, Malling 793 (M. 793). An in-depth analysis of the apple FT/TFL 1 gene family identified four new members: MdMFTa, MdMFTb, MdBFTa and MdBFTb. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed the higher expression of MdFT 1 / 2, MdBFTa/b, MdCO, MdGI, and MdSOC 1 in two different {{dwarfing rootstock}}s (M. 9 and Malling 27 (M. 27)) relative to M. 793. Both MdFT 1 / 2, and MdBFTa/b were expressed at higher levels in multiple dwarfing rootstock accessions relative to more vigorous genotypes. In perennial species, FT promotes flowering, and has additional roles in accelerating the transition from juvenility to maturity, and regulating cycles of seasonal growth and termination. Apple dwarfing rootstocks reduce the juvenile phase and promote both flowering and early shoot termination. Our work supports a role for MdFT in promoting flowering and earlier shoot termination. We suggest that upregulation of a suite of flowering genes including MdFT, and possibly MdBFT, in the vasculature is part of the underlying mechanism of apple dwarfing rootstocks. Genes involved with response to biotic and abiotic stress and disease were also upregulated in the M. 9 rootstock, suggesting that stress, possibly mediated by JA and ABA signalling, also plays a role in the M. 9 -induced phenotype...|$|R
50|$|Bands for FeH (and other {{hydrides}} {{of transition}} metals and alkaline earths) show up {{prominently in the}} emission spectra for M dwarfs and L dwarfs, the hottest kind of brown dwarf. For cooler T dwarfs, the bands for FeH do not appear, probably due to liquid iron clouds blocking {{the view of the}} atmosphere, and removing it from the gas phase of the atmosphere. For even cooler brown <b>dwarfs</b> (<1350 K), <b>signals</b> for FeH reappear, which is explained by the clouds having gaps.|$|R
