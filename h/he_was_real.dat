However, scholar Christopher Metress connects the mockingbird to Boo Radley: [...] "Instead of wanting to exploit Boo for her own fun (as she does {{in the beginning of}} the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history), Scout comes to see him as a 'mockingbird'—that is, as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished." [...] The last pages of the book illustrate this as Scout relates the moral of a story Atticus has been reading to her, and, in allusions to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson, states about a character who was misunderstood, [...] "when they finally saw him, why he hadn't done any of those things... Atticus, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>real</b> nice," [...] to which he responds, [...] "Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Velveteen Rabbit or How Toys Become Real was Margery Williams Bianco's first American work, and {{it remains}} her most famous. It has {{remained}} a classic piece of literature through numerous adaptations in children's theatre {{as well as on}} radio, television and in the movies. The author's trademark undercurrents of sentimentality and sadness persist in the tale of a small boy who finds a velveteen rabbit in his Christmas stocking. The boy quickly discards the toy after playing with it for a few hours in the bustle of Christmas and relatives. [...] In the nursery the rabbit is looked down on by the fancier wind up toys. He asks the skin horse, [...] "What is Real?" [...] The skin horse tells him, [...] "When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real." [...] The boy comes to adore the rabbit, and they are constant companions. This happy existence continues until the boy contracts scarlet fever. [...] The rabbit stays with him, whispering to him of the games they will play again when he is better. [...] As the boy gets better his family prepares {{to take him to the}} seaside. Although the rabbit looks forward to the seaside very much, the doctor insists he be thrown out and burned along with the other toys that may be infected. While the rabbit is waiting to be burned, he cries a real tear, from which a fairy emerges. The fairy tells the rabbit that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>real</b> to the boy, because the boy loved him, but now she will make him truly real. [...] Later, the boy sees a real rabbit in the garden. [...] He thinks it looks like his old rabbit, but he does not know that it really is the velveteen rabbit he once loved.|$|E

Wasn't that like a man? It was the anniversary of his wedding day, too. Nice, tasty time to pick for it, wasn't it? And, of course, that poor Leslie had to be the one to find him. She went into the parlor that morning, singing, with some fresh flowers for the vases, and there she saw her father hanging from the ceiling, his face as black as a coal. It was something awful, believe ME!" ...|$|E

60|$|In my anxiety to draw Mr. Brumley as he was, I have {{perhaps a}} little {{neglected}} to show him as Lady Harman saw him. We have employed the inconsiderate verisimilitude of a novelist repudiating romance in his portrayal; towards her he kept a better face. He {{was at least a}} very honest lover and there was little disingenuousness in the flow of fine mental attitudes that met her; the thought and presence of her made him fine; as soon could he have turned his shady side towards the sun. And she was very ready and eager to credit him with generous qualities. We of his club and circle, a little assisted perhaps by Max Beerbohm's diabolical index finger, may have found and been not unwilling to find his face chiefly expressive of a kind of empty alertness; but when it was turned to her its quite pleasantly modelled features glowed and it was transfigured. So far as she was concerned, with Sir Isaac as foil, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>real</b> enough and good enough for her. And by the virtue of that unlovely contrast even a certain ineffectiveness--became infinite delicacy....|$|E

John Douglas begun to go with me twenty years ago, before mother died. Well, he kept coming and coming, and after a spell I begun making quilts and things; but he never said anything about getting married, only just kept coming and coming. There wasn't anything I could do. Mother died when we'd been going together for eight years. I thought he maybe would speak out then, seeing as I was left alone in the world. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>real</b> kind and feeling, and did everything he could for me, but he never said marry. And that's the way it has been going on ever since. People blame ME for it. They say I won't marry him because his mother is so sickly and I don't want the bother of waiting on her. Why, I'd LOVE to wait on John's mother! But I let them think so. I'd rather they'd blame me than pity me! It's so dreadful humiliating that John won't ask me. And WHY won't he?

6000|$|... "Well, it's this way, Dorothy. Long ago Miss Hannah had {{a brother}} who ran away from home. It was before their father and mother died. Ralph Walworth was as wild a young scamp as ever was in Prospect and a spendthrift in the bargain. Nobody but Hannah had any use for him, and she just worshipped him. I must admit <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>real</b> fond of her too, {{but he and his}} father couldn't get on at all. So finally he ups and runs away; it was {{generally}} supposed he went to the mining country. He left a note for Hannah bidding her goodbye and telling her {{that he was going to}} make his fortune and would come back to her a rich man. There's never been a word heard tell of him since, and in my opinion it's doubtful if he's still alive. But Miss Hannah, as you saw, is sure and certain he'll come back yet with gold dropping out of his pockets. She's as sane as anyone everyway else, but there is no doubt she's a little cracked on that p'int. If he never turns up she'll go on hoping quite happy to her death. But if he should turn up and be poor, as is ten times likelier than anything else, I believe it'd most kill Miss Hannah. She's terrible proud for all she's so sweet, and you saw yourself how mad she got when I kind of hinted he mightn't be rich. If he came back poor, after all her boasting about him, I don't fancy he'd get much of a welcome from her. And she'd never hold up her head again, that's certain. So it's to be hoped, say I, that Ralph Walworth never will turn up, unless he comes in a carriage and four, which is about as likely, in my opinion, as that he'll come in a pumpkin drawn by mice." ...|$|E
