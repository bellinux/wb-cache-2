5|$|Shortly afterwards, a {{delivery}} from Larwood knocked Woodfull's bat {{from his hands}} and the Australian captain seemed unsettled. Two quick wickets fell before Ponsford joined Woodfull in the middle, but having been struck by short balls several more times, Woodfull was bowled by Allen for 22, having batted <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half. When a doctor was publicly requested, to attend an injury to Voce, many in the crowd believed it was Woodfull who required assistance, leading to a renewal of protest. In later years, Woodfull's wife believed that his injury at Adelaide was partly responsible for his death aged 67 in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{previous}} failures, the Chinese launched another series of attacks from 11:30 and these attacks continued {{for the next}} two hours, again targeting 12 Platoon under the command of Lieutenant John Ward. Failing to break through again, the Chinese suffered heavy casualties before the assault ended. From 13:30 there was another lull in the fighting <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half, although D Company continued to endure Chinese mortar, machine-gun and rifle fire. Believing that the battle may continue into the night, Gravener made the decision to pull 12 Platoon back in order to adopt a tighter company perimeter, lest his forward platoon be overrun and destroyed. The movement was completed without incident and, shortly after, the newly vacated position was assaulted by a large Chinese force which had failed to detect the withdrawal. The Chinese moved quickly as they attempted to establish their position on the northern end of the ridge, only to be heavily engaged by Australian machine-gun and rifle fire, and artillery.|$|E
5|$|Enron's audit {{committee}} was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover {{large amounts of}} material. In one meeting on February 12, 2001, the committee met <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half. Enron's {{audit committee}} {{did not have the}} technical knowledge to question the auditors properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. The committee was also unable to question the company's management due to pressures on the committee. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing conflicts of interest to impede their duties as monitoring the company's accounting practices. When Enron's scandal became public, the audit committee's conflicts of interest were regarded with suspicion.|$|E

On the night of 2728 March, Guam {{and the rest of}} Cruiser Division 16 bombarded the airfield on Minamidaitō. After concluding the bombardment, Guam returned to the carrier screen while they conducted operations off Nansei Shoto until 11 May. The ship then steamed to Ulithi for periodic maintenance and to replenish ammunition and supplies. She {{then returned}} to Okinawa, assigned to Task Group 38.4 of William Halsey's Third Fleet. She continued to provide anti-aircraft defense for the carriers while they launched fighter sweeps of Kyushu.

25|$|Stokes and Prior {{frustrated}} Australia <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half on {{the fifth}} day before Prior was dismissed for 26. Shortly afterwards, Stokes reached his maiden Test century, and the tourists went into lunch at 6/332. However, he was caught by Haddin off the bowling of Lyon for 120 straight after the resumption, and Australia was able to wrap up the innings for 353. Australia won by 150 runs, securing a 3–0 series lead, and with it, their first Ashes series win since 2006–07. Smith was man of the match for his hundred in the first innings.|$|E
25|$|While off Land's End on 29 May 1794 {{she came}} across , sailing under French colours. The Castor, {{originally}} under Captain Thomas Troubridge, {{had been captured}} twenty days earlier by a French squadron under Joseph-Marie Nielly during the Atlantic campaign of May 1794. Castor was being sailed back to France by a French prize crew {{at the time she}} was discovered, and was towing a Dutch brig. The French cast off the brig and fought Carysfort <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> quarter, before surrendering. Carysforts casualties amounted to one dead and four wounded, while the French in Castor had 16 killed and nine wounded. One master's mate and eighteen seaman of the original crew were released after the recapture, but Troubridge and most of the British crew had been taken aboard Nielly's flagship, Sans Pareil, and would {{have to wait for the}} defeat of the French fleets at the Glorious First of June and the capture of Sans Pareil before they could be freed.|$|E

25|$|The ships reached Dunedin Star on 1 or 2 December. Nerine {{launched}} {{some of her}} supply-laden Carley floats {{to reach}} the shore party, but the strong current swept them away. She {{moved closer to the}} shore, launched her remaining floats and returned to Walvis Bay. Temeraire launched her motor boat and took 10 men off Dunedin Star, but the boat shipped a lot of water which stopped her motor. The Norwegian boatmen then rowed <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half to Manchester Division, which took the 10 survivors aboard. The Norwegians were now so exhausted that Temeraire had to take them and their boat back aboard. The next day Sir Charles Elliot arrived. Temeraire again lowered her motor boat, which in four trips rescued the remaining 32 men from Dunedin Star and transferred them all to Sir Charles Elliot. In the heavy sea the tug then struggled to get alongside Manchester Division to transfer all of the rescued men except Captain Lee and his Chief and Second Engineers, who were taken aboard Nerine.|$|E
25|$|Then on 25 September 1801 a {{privateer}} hoisting the Spanish flag unsuccessfully engaged Pickle in a single-ship {{action that}} resulted in the death of her commander, Lieutenant Greenshields, and the wounding of Midshipman Pierce, the master, Thomas Hayer, and seven others of her crew. At 11am, some five or six miles NW of the Isle of Ash (aka Île à Vache or Cow Island, south of Hispaniola), Pickle sighted a vessel flying the British flag and sailing towards it. When the vessel got within pistol-shot, he hauled up the Spanish flag and opened fire. The fight lasted an hour and a quarter, with a musket ball through the body killing Greenshields about 40 minutes in. The Spanish vessel then tried to board Pickle, but when the Spaniard was unable to do so, he fled. Pickle chased the privateer <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half but the privateer was faster and Pickle gave up the chase. Hayer, who wrote the report of the action, described the privateer as having two 12-pounder and two 9-pounder guns, and a crew of about 70 men. Pickle had a crew of 35, of whom three were incapacitated by illness.|$|E
25|$|The prisoners waited about a {{week for}} a moonless night, and on Friday 24 March the escape attempt began. As night fell, those {{allocated}} a place moved to Hut 104. Unfortunately for the prisoners, the exit trap door of Harry was frozen solid and freeing it delayed the escape <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half. Then it was discovered that the tunnel had come up short of the nearby forest; at 10.30 p.m. the first man out emerged just short of the tree line close to a guard tower. (According to Alan Burgess, in his book The Longest Tunnel, the tunnel reached the forest, as planned, but the first few trees were too sparse to provide adequate cover.) As the temperature was below freezing and there was snow on the ground, a dark trail would be created by crawling to cover. To avoid being seen by the sentries, the escapes were reduced to about ten per hour, rather than the one every minute that had been planned. Word was eventually sent back that no-one issued with a number above 100 {{would be able to get}} away before daylight. As they would be shot if caught trying to return to their own barracks, these men changed back into their own uniforms and got some sleep. An air raid then caused the camp's (and the tunnel's) electric lighting to be shut down, slowing the escape even more. At around 1 a.m., the tunnel collapsed and had to be repaired.|$|E

25|$|In {{the tournament}} quarterfinals Royce and Sakuraba battled <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half (six 15 minute rounds). Gracie opened the fight aggressively, raining punches from Kazushi's back while the Japanese worked an armlock from standing, but Sakuraba kept calm, knowing Royce had no {{knockout}} power and {{expecting him to}} waste his energy; he even came {{to the point of}} smiling to the cameras during the attack (Sakuraba went on later to claim that he was actually greeting a cameraman who was a personal friend of his). Towards the end of the round, Sakuraba nearly ended the match with a kneebar, while Gracie came back with a guillotine choke at the second, but Kazushi again joked to show he was out of danger by simulating to pull down Royce's gi pants. Sakuraba switched to attack at the third round, dominating the stand up and making Royce lie repeatedly on the ground to avoid him. As the confrontation stretched on, the Gracie's own no time-limit rules began to work against Royce as Sakuraba's wrestling skills and balance nullified Royce's ability to score a takedown and—in some instances—even pull guard. Even Royce's ever-present jiu-jitsu gi became a weapon for the wrestler to use against him as Sakuraba used it to help him control Gracie on the instances the fight did come to the ground. However, with Sakuraba's control of the takedown, these instances of ground warfare became increasingly sporadic. After Kazushi landed a long series of punishing leg kicks at the fifth and sixth rounds, Royce's brother, Rorion threw in the towel.|$|E

Wisden recorded: [...] "Small, batting in fine form <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half, enjoyed the {{distinction}} of making the only score of over 50 for his side."
