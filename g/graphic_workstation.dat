The seamless messaging agents include coarse-grained agents such as user agents, message transfer agents, server agents (for resources such as speech recognition and generation), application agents (interfacing to mail applications such as Microsoft and Unix mail) and device agents (for wireless phones, laptops, etc.). It also includes fine-grained agents, namely, user surrogate agents. Seamless messaging requires real-time performance which necessitates a tradeoff between agent communication, adaptability and intelligence to achieve a variety of tasks. In addition, seamless messaging requires user interface mediation between users and device agents to allow, for example, messages sent by users from a powerful <b>graphic</b> <b>workstation</b> to be received transparently by a cellular phone. 1.

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{developed}} a basic, interactive, primitive-instancing 3 -D modelling system (CAADF), {{which is based on}} a high-speed 3 -D color <b>graphic</b> <b>workstation,</b> and have tested its potential ability to support spatial design studies in an architectural design studio. After- a review of work performed by a student with the system, this paper concludes that this system provides an attractive environment for spatial design studies which conventional CAD systems have not achieved. The interactive process of 3 -D modelling in perspective or isometric view images and the dynamic viewing utility are the most successful features of the system. In contrast to those advantages, the resolution of color graphic display is a limitation of the system. The authors conclude that if sufficiently many appropriate 3 -D geometric primitives are supported by a CAD system, a primitive instancing method can significantly reduce the work entailed in object modelling...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Stereoscopic display {{devices are}} now {{standard}} offerings for <b>graphics</b> <b>workstations.</b> These displays find application in medical, scientific, and engineering visualization. Several geometric models {{can be used}} to determine the projections for stereoscopic images. In some circumstances, however, the perceived image may be uncomfortable to view, or it may contain undesirable depth distortions. We present a geometric model for stereoscopic viewing that can accurately model most viewing situations. Using this model, the viewer comfortably perceives realistic size and depth relationships among objects in the stereoscopic image. We relate this model to human visual constraints, and develop the geometric transformations required to use this method on <b>graphics</b> <b>workstations.</b> 1.
