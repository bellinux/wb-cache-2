5|$|According to a {{press release}} issued by Samuel Estimo, an {{attorney}} representing Jinky Young, the Supreme Court of Iceland ruled, in December 2009, that Watai's claim of marriage to Fischer was invalidated because of her failure to present the original copy of their alleged marriage certificate. On June 16, 2010, the Court {{ruled in favor of}} a petition on behalf of Jinky Young to have Fischer's remains exhumed. The exhumation was performed on July 5, 2010, {{in the presence of a}} doctor, a priest, and other officials. A DNA sample was taken and Fischer's body was then reburied. On August 17, 2010, the Court announced that based on the DNA sample it was determined that Fischer was not the father of Jinky Young. On March 3, 2011, an Icelandic district court ruled that Miyoko Watai and Fischer had married on September 6, 2004, and that, as Fischer's widow and heir, Watai was therefore <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> Fischer's estate. Fischer's nephews were ordered to pay Watai's legal costs, amounting to ISK 6.6 million (approximately $57,000).|$|E
25|$|Religion {{professor}} Tikva Frymer-Kensky {{has pointed}} out the economic implications of a Hebrew levirate marriage: the first child born to the brother's widow would be deemed the heir of the deceased brother, and able to claim the deceased brother's share of inheritance. If the deceased brother was the firstborn son, his inheritance was a double share. However, if the deceased brother were childless, the living brother would be <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> an increased share; or if he is the oldest surviving son he would be entitled to a double share of the increased share.|$|E

He was a dethroned prince from Sparta, and had fled from the {{political}} storms of his own country to seek refuge in Darius's capital. Demaratus {{found a way to}} reconcile Darius's pride as a sovereign with his personal preferences as a husband and a father. He told the king that, according to the principles of hereditary succession which were adopted in Greece, Xerxes was his heir as well as Cyrus's, for he was the oldest son who was born after his accession. A son, he said, according to the Greek ideas on the subject, was <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> only such rank as his father held when the son was born; and that, consequently, none of his children who had been born before his accession could have any claims to the Persian throne. Artobazanes, in a word, was to be regarded, he said, only as the son of Darius the noble, while Xerxes was the son of Darius the king.|$|E

To settle the practice, the following rule is announced for the guidance of all concerned: The numerical designation of a troop unit does not in itself <b>entitle</b> that unit <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> the history of any previous unit having that number; the organization itself will be traced through its changes, regardless of number.|$|R
2500|$|The king {{introduced}} a new royal prerogative in 1332 when he entitled Margaret de genere Nádasd <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> her father's possessions in contradiction to the customs of the kingdom prescribing that daughters can inherit only one-fourth of their father's estates and {{the other parts of}} the estates should pass to his agnates. Thenceforward, the monarchs could strengthen the financial conditions of their followers by using the prerogative of [...] "prefection" [...] ( [...] , [...] ) and thus <b>entitling</b> their wives <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> their fathers' possessions. King Charles I Robert also set himself against the customs of the kingdom, when he granted landed property to his followers but he stipulated that the property could only be inherited by their descendants and thus he excluded their agnates from the inheritance.|$|R
6000|$|In fact, when William came {{to receive}} back the {{province}} of Normandy again, Robert almost refused to surrender it. He said {{that his father had}} always promised him the duchy of Normandy as his domain so soon as he should become of age, and he claimed now the fulfillment of this promise. Besides, he said that, now that his father was King of England, his former realm was of no consequence to him. It did not add sensibly to his influence or his power, and he might, therefore, without suffering any sensible loss himself, grant it to his son. William, on his part, did not acknowledge the force of either of these arguments. He would not admit that he had ever promised Normandy to his son; and as to voluntarily relinquishing any part of his possessions, he had no faith in the policy of a man's giving up his power or his property to his children until they were justly <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> it by his death; at any rate, he should not do it. He had no idea, as he expressed it, [...] "of putting off his clothes before he was going to bed." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{foundation}} of the long and dreadful quarrel between these royal cousins was, as has been already remarked, their consanguinity, which made them both competitors for the same throne; and as that throne was, in some respects, the highest and most powerful in the world, {{it is not surprising}} that two such ambitious women should be eager and persevering in their contest for it. By turning to the genealogical table on page 68, where a view is presented of the royal family of England in the time of Elizabeth, the reader will see once more what was the precise relationship which the two queens bore to each other and to the succession. By this table it is very evident that Elizabeth was the true inheritor of the crown, provided it were admitted that she was the lawful daughter and heir of King Henry the Eighth, and this depended on the question of the validity of her father's marriage with his first wife, Catharine of Aragon; for, as has been before said, he was married to Anne Boleyn before obtaining any thing like a divorce from Catharine; consequently, the marriage with Elizabeth's mother could not be legally valid, unless that with Catharine had been void from the beginning. The friends of Mary Queen of Scots maintained that it was not thus void, and that, consequently, the marriage with Anne Boleyn was null; that Elizabeth, therefore, the descendant of the marriage, was not, legally and technically, a daughter of Henry the Eighth, and, consequently, not <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> his crown; and that the crown, of right, ought to descend to the next heir, that is, to Mary Queen of Scots herself.|$|E

500|$|Through {{his victory}} over the oligarchs, Charles {{acquired}} about 60% of the Hungarian castles, along with the estates belonging to them. In 1323, he set about revising his previous land grants, which enabled him to reclaim former royal estates. During his reign, special commissions were set up to detect royal estates that had been unlawfully acquired by their owners. Charles refrained from making perpetual grants to his partisans. Instead, he applied a system of [...] "office fiefs" [...] (or honors), whereby his officials were <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> enjoy all revenues accrued from their offices, but only for the time they held those offices. That system assured the preponderance of royal power, enabling Charles to rule [...] "with the plenitude of power", as he emphasized {{in one of his}} charters of 1335. He even ignored customary law: for instance, [...] "promoting a daughter to a son", which <b>entitled</b> her <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> her father's estates instead of her male cousins. Charles also took control of the administration of the Church in Hungary. He appointed the Hungarian prelates at will, without allowing the cathedral chapters to elect them.|$|R
5000|$|Pliny the Elder did {{not marry}} {{and had no}} children. In his will, he adopted his nephew, which <b>entitled</b> the latter <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> the entire estate.

Pliny the Younger thus became the adopted son of Pliny the Elder after the latter's death. For {{at least some of}} the time, however, Pliny the Elder resided under the same roof with his sister and nephew (whose husband and father, respectively, had died young): they were living there when Pliny the Elder decided to investigate the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, and was sidetracked by the need for rescue operations and a messenger from his friend asking for assistance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{constitution}} of the Islamic Republic of Iran recognizes Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism as People of the Book and official religions, and they are granted the right to exercise religious freedom in Iran. Five of the 270 seats in parliament are reserved for these three religions. However, the situation of Bahá'ís, the largest religious minority in the country, is far worse. Bahá'ís are often attacked and dehumanized on political, religious, and social grounds to separate Bahá'ís {{from the rest of}} society. According to Eliz Sanasarian [...] "Of all non-Muslim religious minorities the persecution of the Bahais has been the most widespread, systematic, and uninterrupted." [...] See Religion in Iran and Persecution of Bahá'ís. Also, senior government posts are reserved for Muslims.
