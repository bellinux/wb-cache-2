60|$|This puzzled me yet more; and {{a thought}} coming into my head, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{and my father}} had been twins.|$|E
60|$|Entering into a {{conversation}} with this ancient mariner, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew any legend or stories concerning the old houses all about us.|$|E
60|$|I {{made another}} of those {{mistakes}} which no sensible girl, in my position, would have committed. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> alluded to our new market-place.|$|E
6000|$|MRS. BARLOW. Only {{one other}} thing <b>I</b> <b>ask.</b> <b>If</b> <b>he</b> must fight--and fight he must--let him alone: don't you try to shield him or save him. DON'T INTERFERE--do you hear? ...|$|R
5000|$|... "That's {{the last}} thing <b>I</b> need"—when <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> ever thought of working.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had any {{particular}} or definite office in view.|$|R
60|$|My {{colleague}} {{read the}} paper, {{and handed it}} back to me without making any remark. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> suspected the Prisoner of feigning conversion to please the Minister.|$|E
60|$|On his return, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had seen}} {{anything}} of some acquaintances {{of his and}} of mine, who were then visitors to the metropolis. He smiled significantly when he answered me.|$|E
60|$|I had no {{particular}} desire {{to hear about}} the commodore or Darius, therefore <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew anything concerning Elias Macomber, and as I mentioned the name Bill burst into a hearty laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yet {{there are}} {{untoward}} circumstances,' Merton admitted. 'I wish {{to ask you}} two or three questions. I must give you my word of honour that I {{have no intention of}} injuring your father. The reverse; I am really acting in his interests. Now, first, he has practised in Australia. May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was interested in the Aborigines?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> yet {{proposed}} to himself any time for going away.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{believed}} that this {{was such a great}} scandal after all.|$|R
60|$|I was {{so shocked}} and distressed that I had the {{greatest}} difficulty in preserving my own self-control. In the effort to comfort him, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had ventured to confide in his father.|$|E
60|$|Much to my surprise, Sergeant Corney {{appeared}} sadly {{disappointed when}} the tumult of battle died away, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{believed that the}} people from the fort should have made an attempt to inflict more punishment upon the enemy.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the morning}} I waited till the man Jenkinson came {{and told me}} that [...] Mr. Ernest would start at ten. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would breakfast on [...] board; he {{answered}} that he would take his cafe-complet at the [...] hotel, but breakfast on board.|$|E
6000|$|... "I warned your friend," [...] he said, [...] "that {{his conduct}} was causing anxiety {{which you were}} {{not strong enough to}} bear. On hearing this he at once promised to follow the advice which you had given to him, and to join the yacht. As you know, he has kept his word. May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has ever {{followed}} the medical profession?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{would return}} {{at once to}} Upper Egypt, where he had his bishopric.|$|R
60|$|Having {{accepted}} his courtesy, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had been long}} a domestic at Osbaldistone Hall.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{said he got}} on very well; but {{one does}} not know that means. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> got books; and {{he said there was}} a very good library, and he could get what gave him {{something}} to think of; and he says they give interesting lectures in school.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{could tell}} me where to find him. I told {{him that if he}} could get me the address it would be worth another half {{sovereign}} to him. So he gulped down the rest of his tea and stood up, saying {{that he was going to}} begin the search then and there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lunatic!--the old fellow is as sane as you or I; and he {{has some}} ground of {{complaint}} against those Sansis. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would like a native superintendent of police with some men to make inquiries, but he objected on the grounds the police were rather worse than smallpox and criminal tribes put together." ...|$|E
60|$|Joe recited this couplet {{with such}} {{manifest}} pride and careful perspicuity, that <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had made it}} himself.|$|R
60|$|Hollis ceased. But {{before we}} {{rose from the}} table <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew {{what had become of}} Laughing Anne’s boy.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{intended}} {{to take part}} in the feast, as the splendour of his apparel brought me to believe.|$|R
60|$|If Hiram Griffin {{had been}} {{standing}} near the door listening to our conversation {{he could not have}} entered the room at a better moment, for the doctor had but just spoken those words which were the same as token of my dismissal, when he came in, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could tell me where my father might be found.|$|E
60|$|Walking {{the other}} evening with M. Fazy, who is, of course, French in education, we talked of our English literature. He. had Hamlet in French--just think of it. One never feels the {{national}} difference {{so much as}} in thinking of Shakspeare in French! Madame de Stael says of translation, that music written for one instrument cannot be played upon another. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had read Milton.|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had leisure to be {{my guide}} about Paris, for my time was short and I wanted to see everything; he pranced, {{and told me he}} had promised himself a holiday, and had planned many {{excursions}} the most wonderful, charming, and gay. Then, having settled me at Madame's, he went blithely away to what I afterwards discovered were very poor lodgings, across the river.|$|E
60|$|He {{paused for}} a moment, while <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could {{remember}} {{the nature of the}} country through which he had journeyed.|$|R
60|$|As we {{went along}} in silence I noticed that Peterkin sighed {{once or twice}} very heavily, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was quite well.|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{night when}} Jem and I were talking things over in Rainbow Valley, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had ever felt afraid at the front.|$|R
60|$|As if {{eager to}} know how long we might find a ready market thereabouts, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could tell me {{when there was a}} {{possibility}} of the ship's being moved; but he shut his mouth as close as any of our oysters, saying that it was enough for us to know that they would patronize us while they remained there, consequently I did not succeed in getting any information for Commodore Barney.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Morris, of course," [...] he answered. [...] "He {{is the new}} guest--and {{he turns}} out to be more than the equal, socially-speaking, of our other friend. When I showed him his room, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was related to a man who bore the same name--a fellow student of mine, years and years ago, at college. He is my friend's younger son; one of a ruined family--but persons of high {{distinction}} in their day." ...|$|E
6000|$|In silence, the Minister {{read the}} letter, and {{attached}} his signature to it. In silence, {{he rose and}} took my arm. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wished {{to go to his}} room. He only replied by a sign. I offered to sit with him, and try to cheer him. Gratefully, he pressed my hand: gently, he put me back from the door. Crushed by the miserable discovery of the decay of his own faculties! What could I do? what could I say? Nothing! ...|$|E
6000|$|He half demurred, {{but took}} the track, [...] And silence held the scene; I saw his figure {{rambling}} back; [...] <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been.|$|R
60|$|We {{had to have}} a {{young lady}} {{assistant}} to help us work this graft; and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Buck <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew of one to fill the bill.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him <b>If</b> <b>he</b> meant {{about the}} battle? for if the captain once knew the {{standard}} was down, he would certainly put to sea again at once.|$|R
