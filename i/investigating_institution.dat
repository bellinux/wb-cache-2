40|$|Law {{enforcement}} {{is a condition}} sine qua non {{for the implementation of}} democracy. It is necessary to maintain law order, secure political decision making processes, guarantee individual freedom, and protect human rights. Beside, in the context of law enforcement process, the independence of judiciary system is needed for materialization of the principle of law based State. The judiciary system will be independent as long as the stake holders of that institution are independent and truth and justice oriented. The independence of the police institution as sub-system of the judiciary is necessary in the investigation of crime. Normatively it was recognized that the police is institutionally independent and separated from the TNI since 1 July 2000, by the promulgation of the People Assembly Number: VI/MPR/ 2000 and Act Number: 2 / 2002 on Indonesian Police. However, in operational level there are external and internal shortcomings. Internal shortcomings meant are the behavior of the criminal investigator police which are not transparent, militaristic, unprofessional, discriminative, and tends to use violent actions. External shortcomings are problem related to the existence of legal instruments, vertical and horizontal intervention from the colleagues, public, “old brother”, and limited budget and facilities to support investigation process.  The independence of the police as the criminal <b>investigating</b> <b>institution</b> {{in the criminal justice system}} requires supporting aspects such as available legal instrument, well organization, political will of the government, capable human resources, budget, means, personal investigating police and cultural aspect of criminal investigating police as civilian police. Therefore the works of the criminal investigating police have to be reported to the concerned victims. Apart from that exist legal instruments such as the law criminal procedure and related regulations have to be reviewed an amended...|$|E

40|$|This paper <b>investigates</b> <b>institutions</b> for the {{creation}} and transmission of knowledge as efficient resource allocation mechanisms. By looking at Science and Technology it develops a two way classification. Science, is a non market allocation mechanism, where knowledge is treated as a pure public good and where the rule of priority provides an incentive scheme for disclosure. Technology, is a market allocation mechanism, where knowledge is treated as a private good and where patents and copyrights preserve property rights. The distinction between these two entities {{is based on the}} institutional arrangements involving the allocation of resources for enquiry, not on the differences in the objects and methods of inquiry. The paper compares the rule of priority and patenting as alternative incentive schemes.

40|$|This paper investigates two {{different}} approaches {{to the analysis of}} institutions using game theory and discusses their methodological and theoretical implications for further research. Starting from von Neumann and Morgenstern’s theory, we investigate, how Schotter and Schelling’s approaches to the analysis of economic institutions contribute to develop a proper cognitive method to <b>investigate</b> <b>institutions</b> as the unplanned outcome of self- interested individual behavior? While the game theory model developed by Schotter does not allow to encompass the complexity of decision-making processes leading to the emergence of institutions, Schelling’s empirical approach contributes to the cognitive inquiry into economic institutions and it opens the way to an interdisciplinary research method in which pure theory, empirical research and insight coming from different research fields work together. Starting form Schelling’s work it is possible to draw the progress achieved by the cognitive economics of institutions and to suggest the need of further experimental and empirical research to better understand the cognitive dynamics that shape human behavior and influence the emergence of economic institutions...|$|R

40|$|Carefully {{designed}} and implemented evaluations can improve people’s welfare, and enhance development effectiveness. The paper <b>investigates</b> <b>institutions</b> in Mexico, Chile,and Colombia, and shows {{that for the}} successful inception of an institutionalised system for evaluation, three common factors stand out: {{the existence of a}} democratic system with a vocal opposition, the existence of influential M&E champions to lead the process, and a clear powerful stakeholder. Mexico’s CONEVAL is the most independent of the three bodies, mainly {{due to the fact that}} it is reporting to an executive board of independent academics; Chile’s Dipres is the best placed in terms of enforcement, with its location within the Ministry of Finance and control of an independent budget; and Colombia’s Sinergia helps promote a culture of utilization of evaluations as a project management tool. However, actual usage of M&E information and the resulting effect upon development effectiveness are the benchmarks of success. The paper concludes that an explicit and thoughtful process of assessing the needs, the focus, and the emphasis of the system should serve officials and champions to identify adequate arrangements for the particular country context and understand how to better respond to the forces pushing for the creation of new M&E units and bodies. institutionalisation; impact evaluation...|$|R
