40|$|A {{range of}} uranium oxide-based catalysts, derived from UO 2 (NO 3) 2 · 6 H 2 O and UCl 4 precursors, and {{supported}} on ?-Al 2 O 3, SiO 2 and mesoporous H 1 SiO 2, have been synthesized and then characterized {{using the following}} methods: isothermal nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements, diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS), <b>gas</b> <b>titration</b> of surface hydroxyl groups using Grignard reagents, U LIII extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis. Brij 76 -templated H 1 SiO 2 mesoporous silicas {{are found to be}} essentially stable under flowing oxygen after 16 h at 1073 K. At temperatures above this, however, extensive structural collapse, together with extensive dehydroxylation, ensues. Titration of the accessible hydroxyl group concentrations shows that in these materials the density of OH groups is considerably lower than in their amorphous counterparts. The adsorption of uranyl nitrate onto these dispersants results in a supported, and partially dehydrated, phase of the parent molecule with little obvious structural distortion; however, the adsorption of UCl 4 leads to a complex adstructure which may best be described as U(O) 2 Cl 2. The subsequent formation of the uranium oxide phase, nominally active for the oxidation of CO and selective reduction of NO (generally accepted to be U 3 O 8), is found to be a considerable function of both the precursor and support system employed. Calcination of such systems to 1073 K results in extensive extrusion of the supported uranium phase from mesoporous supports, resulting in the formation of very large orthorhombic U 3 O 8 domains. PXRD, however, shows that on amorphous SiO 2 and -Al 2 O 3 similar treatment results in the formation of a hexagonal phase of U 3 O 8. The formation of U 3 O 8 is found to be promoted in mesoporous systems and by the presence of Cl in the catalyst make up. Some evidence is also found that suggests that a persistence of Cl limits the growth of U 3 O 8 domains...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{series of}} {{myoglobin}} active site analogues were synthesized and characterized {{to investigate the}} dioxygen binding effects of a flexible distal strap over the coordination site. These four synthetic models differ mostly by the shape and polarity of their cavities and also possibly by motion of the distal strap attached {{to two of the}} meso carbon atoms. Each of the four models has an intramolecular nitrogen base that axially binds the iron(II) cation inside the porphyrin, but they differ either {{by the nature of the}} distal strap or by its mobility. The overhanging distal group is either a generally apolar ethyl malonate group or a polar malonic acid group which is also a strong H-bond donor. It is shown that, in the ferrous complex 2 b bearing such an overhung malonic acid group in close proximity to the iron atom, the equilibrium rate for dioxygen binding is significantly enhanced in comparison to that of its ester precursor. In the case of the analogous complex 1 b bearing a more mobile distal strap, one of the carboxylic acid groups binds the iron(II) cation, leading to a six-coordinate ferrous complex. Unexpectedly, this complex proved to be high-spin (S = 2) as shown by solid-state magnetic measurements. Whereas this unprecedented complex still binds dioxygen, the formation of the intramolecular six-coordinate complex precluded the measurement of its dioxygen affinity through direct quantitative <b>gas</b> <b>titration</b> monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy. However, in this case, the determination of the kinetic rate constants for dioxygen binding and dissociation by laser flash photolysis allowed the evaluation of the equilibrium rate. Together with three previous X-ray structures of iron complexes in the ααββ conformation, the structure of the cavity and the shape of the relaxed distal strap are also discussed with the consideration of the resolution of X-ray structures of two different free-base ligands in the ααββ conformation, with one bearing the ethyl malonate group and the second one bearing the malonic acid group. A third X-ray structure of the analogous ligand with the overhanging ethyl malonate group in the αβαβ series allows a direct comparison of the distal strap in both geometries. This work reveals that the compound with the overhanging carboxylic acid group which cannot directly interact with the ferrous heme exhibits an increased dioxygen affinity by 2 orders of magnitude versus its ester precursor...|$|E

The cavity dimensions and conformation of 2 were determined by single-crystal X-ray structural analysis of the Zn analogue 7.

40|$|International audienceThree {{series of}} Rh/Al 2 O 3 {{catalysts}} {{were characterized by}} chemisorption of <b>gases,</b> <b>titrations.,</b> temperature-programmed reduction, and XPS. The temperature of calcination (393 - 1173 K), the temp. of redn. (773 - 1173 K), {{and the introduction of}} steam in the pretreatment (723 K) were varied. Air calcination at > 823 K leads to catalysts partially reducible at 773 K, with sintering of the reduced phase. The diffuse oxide phase (D. O. P.) thus created is very stable. Pure steam substantially increases the formation of this little reducible oxide phase. Treatment under H 2 at > 773 K leads to sintering of Rh particles, which remain totally reducible at 773 K. The presence of H 2 in steam suppresses the appearance of the D. O. P., which can be formed by diffusion of Rh 3 + ions in the Al 2 O 3 matrix. The presence of D. O. P. does not influence the reducibility of surface Rh 2 O 3, which depends essentially on its dispersion: the smaller the oxide particles, the higher their temp. of redn. The binding energy of Rh, measured by XPS, depends on the metal particle size. No metal-oxide interaction was found in the partially reduced samples. Binding energies of Rh 3 + in the D. O. P. are higher than in Rh 2 O 3...|$|R

Gradual decrease of the inhibitor concentration during storage proved to be the main cause of the reduction of shelf-life of HEMA solutions. Inconsistent tissue infiltration after storage may be due to decreased rates of tissue penetration as a result of HEMA chain lengthening.

On the basis of different interactions of bulk- or surface-bound solvated electrons with rare <b>gas</b> atoms, <b>titration</b> experiments using Xe overlayers reveal {{the location of the}} electron solvation sites. In the case of flat clusters with a height of 2 - 4 bilayers adsorbed on Cu(111), solvated electrons are found to reside at the ice - vacuum interface, whereas a bulk character is determined for solvated electrons in wetting layers. Furthermore, time-resolved experiments are performed to determine the origin of the transition between these different solvation sites with increasing D 2 O coverage. We employ an empirical model calculation to analyse the rate of electron transfer back to the substrate and the energetic stabilization of the solvated electrons, which allows further insight into the binding site for clusters. We find that the solvated electrons reside {{at the edges of the}} clusters. Therefore, we attribute the transition from surface- to bulk-solvation to the coalescence of the clusters to a closed ice film occurring at a nominal coverage of 2 - 3 BL, while the distance of the binding sites to the metal-ice interface is maintained...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} ozone {{concentration}} measurements at 20 rural sites throughout the UK has enabled {{the identification of}} the major variables controlling surface ozone concentrations (wind velocity, topography and local NO sources). Empirical methods to quantify the spatial pattern in surface concentrations at 1 km resolution, incorporating these influences, are developed. The procedure maps ozone concentrations from the period of the day when measurements are representative of large areas of countryside. In these conditions, rural monitoring sites (B 100 km apart) are highly correlated ðr 2 X 0 : 8 Þ and least affected by local site characteristics. The effects of boundary layer stability are quantified using the observed relationship between the diurnal variability of surface ozone concentration and altitude. This allows the detailed structure in rural concentrations to be quantified. An urban correction, to account for the <b>gas</b> phase <b>titration</b> of surface ozone by local NO sources, is added to the mapping procedure based on the relationship between urban ozone concentration measurements and those in rural areas. The spatial distribution of the annual average ozone concentration and the accumulated ozone concentration over a threshold of 40 ppb(AOT 40) are calculated from UK measurements. Simple assessments of the effects of ozone on materials and vegetation are made. Although 87...|$|R

40|$|A home-made {{analyzer}} for dissolved gasses in water, {{based on}} membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS), was successfully {{applied for the}} first time as an in-line method for detection of gases dissolved in an aqueous stream, at the exit of a catalytic reactor in a transient experiment. The technique was applied for measuring the metal dispersion of three different catalysts (EuroPt- 1, Pt/SiO 2 and Pt/CNF) in liquid phase via H 2 O 2 titration. The titration stoicheometry obtained (i. e. ratio of H 2 and O 2 consumption) is in agreement with the stoicheometry obtained in <b>gas</b> phase <b>titration</b> experiments in literature. The platinum dispersions obtained in liquid phase are in excellent agreement with dispersions based on hydrogen chemisorption in gas phase for all three catalysts. Clearly, water does not influence the accessibility of the Pt atoms, disagreeing with recent suggestions in literature. In addition, the detector is universal and allows calibration of H 2, O 2, N 2 and Ar dissolved in water with insignificant cross contamination. Despite the relatively slow dynamic response of the detector (between 4 min for hydrogen up to more than 40 min for oxygen), it was proven possible to perform quantitative experiments in pulse mode, with a detection limit in the order of 0. 5 m 2 Pt. The capability of this method is further demonstrated by the surprising observation that dissolved hydrogen physisorbs significantly on a reduced Pt catalyst whereas dissolved oxygen does not interact with an oxidized catalyst. ...|$|R

40|$|Ozone plays {{a crucial}} role in tropospheric chemistry, is the third largest {{contributor}} to greenhouse radiative forcing after carbon dioxide and methane and also a toxic air pollutant affecting human health and agriculture. Long-term measurements of tropospheric ozone have been performed globally for more than 30 years with UV photometers, all relying on the absorption of ozone at the 253. 65 nm line of mercury. We have re-determined this cross-section and report a value of 11. 27 x 10 − 18 cm 2 molecule − 1 with an expanded relative uncertainty of 0. 86 % (coverage factor k = 2). This is lower than the conventional value currently in use and measured by Hearn (1961) with a relative difference of 1. 8 %, with the consequence that historically reported ozone concentrations should be increased by 1. 8 %. In order to perform the new measurements of cross-sections with reduced uncertainties, a system was set up to generate pure ozone in the gas phase together with an optical system based on a UV laser with lines in the Hartley band, including accurate path length measurement of the absorption cell and a careful evaluation of possible impurities in the ozone sample by mass spectrometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This resulted in new measurements of absolute values of ozone absorption cross-sections of 9. 48 x 10 − 18, 10. 44 x 10 − 18 and 11. 07 x 10 − 18 cm 2 molecule − 1, with relative expanded uncertainties better than 0. 7 %, for the wavelengths (in vacuum) of 244. 06, 248. 32, and 257. 34 nm respectively. The cross-section at the 253. 65 nm line of mercury was determined by comparisons using a Standard Reference Photometer equipped with a mercury lamp as the light source. The newly reported value should be used in the future to obtain the most accurate measurements of ozone concentration, which are in closer agreement with non-UV-photometry based methods such as the <b>gas</b> phase <b>titration</b> of ozone with nitrogen monoxide...|$|R
40|$|Catalytic {{synthesis}} of ammonia from hydrogen and atomic nitrogen was demonstrated on polycrystalline platinum and single crystal face Rh(110) catalysts. The atomic nitrogen was prepared by a microwave discharge in a nitrogen-hydrogen gas mixture and quantified by <b>gas</b> phase <b>titration</b> with nitric oxide. The afterglow from the microwave discharge was characterized spectroscopically; no NH, NH 2, or NH 3 species were found, and excited nitrogen species other than atomic nitrogen had sufficiently short half lives that a delay system permitted their complete decay before the afterglow reached the catalyst. Atomic nitrogen was therefore the only excited nitrogen species reaching the catalyst. No ammonia {{was formed in}} the absence of a catalyst. The rate of ammonia synthesis over Rh(110) was measured as a function of the partial pressures of N 2, H 2, and N over pressure ranges 100 3 ̆c PN 2 3 ̆c 570 Pa, 110 PH 2 3 ̆c 1000 Pa, 13 3 ̆c P N 3 ̆c 160 Pa, 330 3 ̆c P Total 3 ̆c 1200 Pa. The Reynolds number was on the order of 10 [superscript]- 3. Most measurements were made at 500 °C, the turnover number for ammonia synthesis on Rh(110) varying from 0. 0079 to 0. 073 molecules site[superscript]- 1 sec[superscript]- 1. A study of the dependence of synthesis rate on Rh(110) on temperature at fixed reactant partial pressures covered the range 400 ° to 750 °C;Over the partial pressure ranges covered at 500 °C on Rh(110) the ammonia synthesis rate could be represented within experimental error by a model assuming it to be proportional to the nitrogen adatom coverage [theta] N only. The latter was interpreted through a steady state model in which the atomic nitrogen adsorption rate, proportional to P N and to (1 - [theta] N, was exactly balanced by rates loss of nitrogen adatoms due to ammonia synthesis (proportional to [theta] N) and to recombination and desorption as N 2 (proportional to [theta]N[superscript] 2). Variations in PN 2 and PH 2 only affected the synthesis rate insofar as they affected P N. At fixed microwave discharge power, however, P N varied considerably with PH 2 and PN 2, being approximately proportional to PH 2 at fixed PN 2 and for fixed PH 2, going through a maximum as PN 2 increased. Qualitative interpretations of this behavior are presented. For fixed partial pressures, the ammonia synthesis rate decreases as the temperature increases, i. e., the apparent activation energy is negative. Several possible interpretations of this behavior are presented. ftn[superscript] 1 DOE Report IS-T- 1363. This work was performed under Contract W- 7405 -Eng- 82 with the Department of Energy...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSeveral factors, {{attributable}} to the ESIMS mechanism, that can affect the assumptions of the titration method are examined: (1) The assumption that the concentrations in solution of the protein P, the ligand L, and the complex PL are proportional to the respective ion intensities observed with ESIMS, is examined with experiments in which ion intensities of two non-interacting proteins are compared with the respective concentrations. The intensities {{are found to be}} approximately proportional to the concentrations. The proportionality factors are found to increase as the mass of the protein is decreased. Very small proteins have much higher intensities. The results suggest that it is preferable to use only the intensity ratio of PL and P, whose masses are very close to each other when L is small, to determine the association constant KA in solution. (2) From the charge residue model (CRM) one expects that the solution will experience a very large increase of concentration due to evaporation of the precursor droplets, before the proteins P and PL are produced in the gas phase. This can shift the equilibrium in the droplets: P + L = PL, towards PL. Analysis of the droplet evaporation history shows that such a shift is not likely, because the time of droplet evolution is very short, only several μs, and the equilibrium relaxation time is much longer. (3) The droplet history shows that unreacted P and L can be often present together in the same droplet. On complete evaporation of such droplets L will land on P leading to PL and this effect will lead to values of KA that are too high. However, it is argued that mostly accidental, weakly bonded, complexes will form and these will dissociate in the clean up stages (heated transfer capillary and CAD region). Thus only very small errors are expected due to this cause. (4) Some PL complexes may have bonding that is too weak in the gas phase even though they have KA values in solution that predict high solution PL yields. In this case the PL complexes may decompose in the clean up stages and not be observed with sufficient intensity in the mass spectrum. This will lead to KA values that are too low. The effect is expected for complexes that involve significant hydrophobic interaction that leads to high stability of the complex in solution but low stability in the <b>gas</b> phase. The <b>titration</b> method is not suited for such systems...|$|R
