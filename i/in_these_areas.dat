5|$|Currently, {{the most}} stable and secure {{part of the sea}} otter's range is Russia. Before the 19th century, around 20,000 to 25,000 sea otters lived near the Kuril Islands, with more near Kamchatka and the Commander Islands. After the years of the Great Hunt, the {{population}} <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>areas,</b> currently part of Russia, was only 750. By 2004, sea otters had repopulated all of their former habitat <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>areas,</b> with an estimated total population of about 27,000. Of these, about 19,000 are at the Kurils, 2,000 to 3,500 at Kamchatka and another 5,000 to 5,500 at the Commander Islands. Growth has slowed slightly, suggesting the numbers are reaching carrying capacity.|$|E

5|$|Another {{criticism}} {{pertains to}} the shift in training focus {{after the end of}} Ueshiba's seclusion in Iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s, as he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido. As a result, strikes to vital points by tori, entering (irimi) and initiation of techniques by tori, the distinction between omote (front side) and ura (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice. Some Aikido practitioners feel that lack of training <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>areas</b> leads to an overall loss of effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Followers of Hinduism {{were also}} present {{to some extent}} during the Anuradhapura Kingdom. There {{were a number of}} them in Rajarata during Elara's reign.

5|$|In 2002, Eduardo Duhalde {{fixed the}} prices for public {{services}} such as electricity, gas, and water supply.

5|$|In {{the absence}} of the {{harassment}} of coyotes practiced by rural people, urban coyotes are losing their fear of humans, which is further worsened by people intentionally or unintentionally feeding coyotes.

5|$|Pupae {{have the}} ability to enter facultative diapause, the state of arrested {{development}} and growth in response to a change in the environment. By preparing themselves for a major change in environmental conditions, they can increase reproductive success. Diapause increases with increasing latitude. In tropical conditions, populations breed continuously, and only 2-4% of pupae diapause. In subtropical and temperate regions, most individuals diapause. Individuals who don't enter diapause <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>areas</b> emerge in late fall and die without reproducing. Drought-responsive diapause has also been observed in the summer.|$|E
