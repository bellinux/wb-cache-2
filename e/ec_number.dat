40|$|Motivation: The {{automatic}} {{perception of}} chemical similarities bet-ween metabolic reactions {{is required for}} a variety of applications ran-ging from the computer-aided validation of classification systems, to genome-scale reconstruction (or comparison) of metabolic pathways, to the classification of enzymatic mechanisms. Comparison of meta-bolic reactions has been mostly based on <b>EC</b> <b>numbers,</b> which are extremely useful and widespread, but not always straightforward to apply, and often problematic when an enzyme catalyzes several reac-tions, when the same reaction is catalyzed by different enzymes, when official full <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> are unavailable, or when reactions are not catalysed by enzymes. Different methods should be available to compare metabolic reactions. Simultaneously, methods are required for the automatic assignment of <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> to reactions still not officially classified. Results: We have proposed the MOLMAP reaction descriptors to numerically encode the structural transformations resulting from a chemical reaction. Here, such descriptors are applied to the mapping of a genome-scale database of almost 4, 000 metabolic reactions by Kohonen self-organizing maps (SOM), and its screening for incon-sistencies in <b>EC</b> <b>numbers.</b> This approach allowed for the SOMs to assign <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> at the class, subclass, and sub-subclass levels for reactions of independent test sets with accuracies up to 92 %, 80 %, and 70 %, respectively. Different levels of similarity between training and test sets were explored. The approach also led to the identification of a number of similar reactions bearing differences at the EC class level. Availability: The programs to generate MOLMAP descriptors from atomic properties included in SDF files are available upon request for evaluation. Contact...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWith {{the growing}} number of protein {{structures}} in the protein data bank (PDB), {{there is a need to}} annotate these structures at the domain level in order to relate protein structure to protein function. Thanks to the SIFTS database, many PDB chains are now cross-referenced with Pfam domains and enzyme commission (<b>EC)</b> <b>numbers.</b> However, these annotations do not include any explicit relationship between individual Pfam domains and <b>EC</b> <b>numbers.</b> This article presents a novel statistical training-based method called EC-PSI that can automatically infer high confidence associations between <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> and Pfam domains directly from EC-chain associations from SIFTS and from EC-sequence associations from the SwissProt, and TrEMBL databases. By collecting and integrating these existing EC-chain/sequence annotations, our approach is able to infer a total of 8, 329 direct EC-Pfam associations with an overall F-measure of 0. 819 with respect to the manually curated InterPro database, which we treat here as a " gold standard " reference dataset. Thus, compared to the 1, 493 EC-Pfam associations in InterPro, our approach provides a way to find over six times as many high quality EC-Pfam associations completely automatically...|$|R

40|$|In {{many of the}} {{chemical}} reactions in living cells, enzymes act as catalysts in the conversion of certain compounds (substrates) into other compounds (products). Comparative analyses of the metabolic pathways formed by such reactions give important information on their evolution and on pharmacological targets (Dandekar ## ### 1999). Each of the enzymes that constitute a pathway is classied according to the <b>EC</b> (Enzyme Commission) <b>numbering</b> system, which consists of four sets of numbers that categorize the type of {{the chemical}} reaction catalyzed.

40|$|The {{complete}} set of cDNAs encoding the enzymes of known metabolic pathways has not previously been available for any mammal. Here, transcripts encoding the metabolic pathways of the mouse (mouse metabolome) were reconstructed by making use of the KEGG metabolic pathway database and gene ontology (GO) assignment to the mouse representative transcript and protein set (RTPS), which contains all available mouse transcript sequences including the FANTOM set of RIKEN mouse cDNA clones. By assigning <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> extracted from the molecular function ontology in GO, the known mouse transcriptome was predicted to encode enzymes with 726 unique <b>EC</b> <b>numbers.</b> Of these, 648 <b>EC</b> <b>numbers</b> were newly assigned based on the FANTOM set. The mouse metabolome confirmed by cDNA analysis includes {{almost all of the}} enzymes of well known pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle and urea cycle. On the other hand, analysis of enzymes required for the tryptophan metabolism pathway revealed a lack of connectivity, indicating that cDNAs/genes encoding several key enzymes remain to be identified. The information derived from coexpression from the cDNA microarray analysis of enzymes of known function may lead to identification of the missing components of the metabolome, and will add new insights into the connectivity of the mammalian metabolic pathways...|$|R

Improving genome annotation could unveil a significant proportion of sequenceless enzymes.
