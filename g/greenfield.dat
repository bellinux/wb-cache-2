40|$|Prior {{studies of}} the {{comparative}} performance of <b>greenfields</b> and acquisitions have advanced competing arguments, with some arguing that <b>greenfields</b> should outperform acquisitions because acquisitions are costlier to integrate, and others that acquisitions should outperform <b>greenfields</b> because <b>greenfields</b> suffer from a liability of newness. Moreover, while the costs of integration and the liability of newness are at their greatest during a subsidiary’s first years, prior studies have tested their competing arguments on samples containing older subsidiaries. We extend these prior studies by (1) developing an institutional theory-based framework that simultaneously considers the costs of integration and the liability of newness, (2) recognizing that both types of costs vary {{with the level of}} subsidiary integration, and (3) focusing on the stage of their life during which subsidiaries predominantly incur these costs. To measure subsidiary performance, we ask managers of Dutch multinationals how their ex ante performance expectations compare to the subsidiary’s ex post performance during its first two years. Analyzing a sample of 191 foreign subsidiaries and controlling for entry mode self-selection and other factors, we find that acquisitions outperform <b>greenfields</b> at low and intermediate levels of subsidiary integration, but that <b>greenfields</b> outperform acquisitions at higher integration levels...|$|R

5|$|The {{early part}} of the 20th century saw a number of {{implants}} made of a variety of materials. One of the earliest successful implants was the <b>Greenfield</b> implant system of 1913 (also known as the <b>Greenfield</b> crib or basket). Greenfield's implant, an iridioplatinum implant attached to a gold crown, showed evidence of osseointegration and lasted for a number of years. The first use of titanium as an implantable material was by Bothe, Beaton and Davenport in 1940, who observed how close the bone grew to titanium screws, and the difficulty they had in extracting them. Bothe et al. were the first researchers to describe what would later be called osseointegration (a name that would be marketed later on by Per-Ingvar Brånemark). In 1951, Gottlieb Leventhal implanted titanium rods in rabbits. Leventhal's positive results led him to believe that titanium represented the ideal metal for surgery.|$|E
