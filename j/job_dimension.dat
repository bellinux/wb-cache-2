Data were collected from nine work groups involving twenty-nine employees. Results indicate enrichment {{in this type of}} organization is possible. Criteria were established to measure the fit of each work group to the five core job dimensions of skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback. A strong correlation between core <b>job</b> <b>dimension</b> scores and productivity levels was indicated. A work control program, compatible with job enrichment, is discussed and used to implement job content changes.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the moderating effects of locus of control on core <b>job</b> <b>dimensions</b> (skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, feedback) and job satisfaction. Survey {{data were collected from}} 1995 educators in Southern Ontario. When core <b>job</b> <b>dimensions</b> were perceived to be high, job satisfaction scores were high. The converse relationship was also true; when core <b>job</b> <b>dimensions</b> were perceived to be low, job satisfaction scores were also low. As well, the investigation explored the effect of educators' locus of control of reinforcement on the relationship between core <b>job</b> <b>dimensions</b> and <b>job</b> satisfaction. Internals (N = 483 - 486) perceived more skill variety, more task identity, more task significance, more autonomy, more feedback and greater job satisfaction than externals (N = 626 - 629). However, contrary to expectation, the correlations between specific core <b>job</b> <b>dimensions</b> namely autonomy and feedback, were not systematically greater for internals compared to externals.

40|$|The {{validity}} of Hackman and Oldman’s (1976) Job Characteristics Model (JCM) has been assessed over 40 years. It has been modified and extended {{to correspond to}} working life issues relevant at each time it has been studied. Our society {{is referred to as}} a knowledge society, where all spheres of human life depend on the ability to create, distribute and share knowledge. Therefore, there is reason to question whether the original JCM corresponds to current working life challenges. In the present re-search, the intention is to study whether the JCM is still relevant in modern knowledge-intensive organizations and if modifications are needed. 	 The research was a qualitative study by nature. The empirical part of the study was formed around semi-structured interviews and the research data was based on the in-terviews, the target company’s background materials and observations during the re-search process. The research questions were based on the background theories around the JCM. The research indicated that the JCM is still relevant in modern working life circum-stances, but needs modification to be more useful. The JCM includes five core job di-mensions: task variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy and feedback. Ac-cording to the model’s developers, the core job dimensions are mediated by critical psychological states leading to personal and work outcomes. The personal and work outcomes are high internal work motivation, high quality work performance, high satis-faction with the work and low absenteeism and turnover. According to the model’s developers, employee growth need strength (GNS) and context satisfaction are mod-erating elements between the core job dimensions and the personal and work out-comes. The present research reveals that all the core job dimensions are still relevant, but they have different power in forming the personal and work outcomes. People’s autonomy {{is by far the most}} powerful <b>job</b> <b>dimension</b> which also influences the for-mation of the other core job dimensions. A new core <b>job</b> <b>dimension</b> was found, good care of people, influencing all the personnel and work outcomes. Furthermore, a good system of selecting people supporting personnel’s high GNS levels was added to the model...|$|E

The relationship between these variables was studied when two moderating variables, psychological states and growth need strength, were present. ^ Theoretical concepts used to support this study were the Job Characteristics theory and a performance concept model of Ivancevich, Szilagyi, and Wallace. ^ Two concerns of researchers were addressed {{in this study of}} Extension agents. One, a population was studied that had common job responsibilities; and two, a population was studied where the entire population was evaluated using one valid performance instrument. ^ Data from 141 Extension agents who completed a modified Job Diagnostic Survey were included in the study. Statistical analyses used to interpret the data included t-tests, Pearson r and partial correlations, and stepwise, foward inclusion, regression analysis. ^ Results showed no significant relationships between the five <b>job</b> <b>dimensions</b> and <b>job</b> performance when a moderating variable was present. Neither was there a difference in the job performance levels between Extension agents in the lowest quartile for growth need strength as opposed to those agents in the highest quartile for growth need strength.

40|$|Team-based {{management}} {{is a popular}} contemporary method of redesigning jobs in order to more effectively utilize the human potential of employees. The use of such management techniques should result in increased satisfaction and team commitment; however, many research studies have failed to demonstrate increases in affective outcomes {{on the part of}} the employee. The research question examined in this study is, "What specific <b>job</b> <b>dimensions</b> and situational factors result in higher levels of satisfaction and team commitment?" The Job Characteristics Model (Hackman & Oldham, 1975) provided a basis for this study. The model was designed for individual contributors and has not been extensively used in team research. As expected it was found that within a team-based environment higher levels of the five core <b>job</b> <b>dimensions</b> of skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and job feedback were associated with increased satisfaction and team commitment. Organization-based self-esteem was found to mediate the relationship between the five core <b>job</b> <b>dimensions</b> and the affective outcome variables. Contrary to expectations, however, it was found that consultative team members experienced higher levels of satisfaction and commitment than substantive team members. In addition, consultative team members reported higher levels of two core <b>job</b> <b>dimensions,</b> skill variety and task significance, and on the overall Job Diagnostic Survey than did substantive team members. These findings have significant implications for companies undergoing organizational redesign and questions whether those companies should implement advanced levels of employee involvement activities if the organizational goal is to increase satisfaction and commitment. The study employed a survey research design in which data was collected using a self-report questionnaire.

Job performance can be defined as the accomplishment of work-related tasks or skills by an employee or trainee that may refer to specific skills or to overall performance (Hackman and Oldham, 1974). Therefore, it is also used for factors associated with success or failure in job situations and most refers to whether an employee performs their job well. On the other definition, job performance is defined in terms of rise in the level of output of services with the same or reduced level of input as a result of better work methods and improved technology (Sharma, 2007). It means that, employee's performance is more important than equipment and raw material. There are two factors that include under the job performance. First is the task performance where it is a traditional method on doing something like to transform and maintain the raw material to ensure the organizational operation. The contextual performance is about the interpersonal and behavior that supports social interaction within the organization.

Empirical part of this study investigates the state of tobacco brand managers’ <b>job</b> <b>dimension</b> concentrating on internal organization structure {{as well as on}} industry specific skills and brand management tools. The empirical part of this study was conducted by interviewing current and former marketing employees of two different global tobacco companies. More specifically two brand managers, a product manager, a brand director and a former marketing director who had worked for a global tobacco company were interviewed for the study. The interviews covered the most important job areas of tobacco brand manager, relationships with internal and external members of brand supporting team as well as industry specific skills and views {{on the future of the}} industry from brand management perspective. Even though most of the interviewees had vast international experience and represented four different nationalities, it has to be noted that the results cannot be straightforwardly generalized as limited amount of respondents and regional aspects (none of the interviewees had worked outside Europe) might affect the results. The data was analyzed using a classification method. First step was reduction where gathered material was simplified. Second step was clustering where the simplified material was divided into groups. Final step was abstracting during which theoretical concepts were created. Most important findings of this study are the skills and the characteristics separating the tobacco brand managers from their colleagues in other consumer goods industries. Another interesting finding is the ongoing shift in tobacco brand management from consumer focus to trade focus.

One hundred students were administered both instruments and predictions made of their GPA 2 ̆ 7 s after the completion of two quarters of classroom study and after the completion of the most recent quarter of classroom study. It was found that the predictions from the JAPO were as good as or better than predictions based on SVIB achievement scores. For the 36 males in the sample a corrected multiple correlation coefficient of. 48 resulted between Undergraduate Cumulative grade Point Average (UCGPA) and the JAPQ <b>Job</b> <b>Dimension</b> Score whereas the SVIB Achievement Scale secured a correlation of. 21. The JAPQ correlation is significant at the. 005 level, but the SVIB correlation is insignificant. When the 64 females in the sample were tested the JAPQ secured a corrected multiple correlation coefficient of. 40, while the SVIB secured a cross-validation coefficient of. 31 between interest and UCGPA.

40|$|Background: The {{demand for}} and {{retention}} of talent worldwide is aggravated by revolutionary trends that include global competition, demographic changes and technological advances. In South Africa this phenomenon according to Frost (2002) is further challenged by the emigration of skilled people; the relative scarcity of specialist and managerial employees; employment equity and affirmative action procedures. But the development of strategies first requires {{an understanding of the}} factors which influence decisions to leave or stay particularly in rural and remote areas. St. Andrews Hospital is a rural district hospital in Ugu District, KZN. Its remoteness from urban areas and the lack of resources contributes towards challenges of attracting and retaining health care professionals to the area. It is the aim of this study to identify the ten most prevalent turnover and retention factors in a rural district hospital with the intention of making recommendations towards strategies to mitigate turnover and improve retention of health care professionals. This study will not only serve the local Human Resource Department but may also be used to inform district and provincial policies as well as departments’ decisions in the design or the review of current retention strategies aimed at reducing turnover. Method: The survey method was used to collect the primary data by distribution of self-administered questionnaires to Health Care Professionals at St. Andrews Hospital. Of the one hundred and fifty questionnaires distributed, one hundred and seven were returned (71 % response rate) and formed the basis of the study. Results: Based on the impact scores, the top three turnover factors identified were, the way the organisation is led by top management (0. 934); the size of the workload (0. 862); and the way problems are dealt with by managers in the organisation (0. 817). No statistically significant relationships were found between turnover factors and biographical variable. Availability of quality health services was ranked as the external factor that had the highest influence (78 %) on turnover, while geographical location was ranked the lowest. The main reason given by respondents for leaving their previous employment was promotion, followed by distance and personal/family reasons. The top three retention factors identified from the impact scores were the quality of relationships with colleagues (1. 698); the amount of support received from managers and colleagues (1. 484); and the level of engagement and involvement with the job (1. 390). This demonstrates that the salary package often thought to be a first priority factor Mobley, Horner and Hollingsworth (1978); Mobley (1982) and Herzberg (2003) is far less of a determining factor at St. Andrews Hospital than management support, job involvement and person-organisation fit as well as the social relationships formed in the workplace. A positive relationship was found between leadership and <b>job</b> <b>dimension</b> factors at the 1 % level of significance. This supports the strong social bond (person-organisation fit) formed in the work environment between management and colleagues that supports retention and increases level of commitment. An important result of the study was that 46 % of the respondents were thinking of leaving the town within the year while 29 % were considering resigning from St. Andrews Hospital within the year. Conclusion: The results reveal a complex interaction of factors impacting on turnover and retention. The Human Resource Management function has a pivotal role to play in improving its ability to attract and retain professionals through developing comprehensive strategies based on external and internal and environmental factors. The study conveys to the St. Andrews Hospital management that turnover and retention factors are unique to the location and the working environment and differs amongst Health Care Professionals – this should be deliberated on when formulating Hospital Human Resource retention policies...|$|E

A second hypothesis predicted that a central element of Expectancy Theory, the expectancy that performance will lead to valued outcomes (E- 2), would relate to the Core <b>Job</b> <b>Dimensions</b> and Critical Psychological States in the same manner as other outcomes described in the original Model. A third hypothesis stated that either global self esteem or a direct assessment of the stated desire for job enrichment would moderate the relationships more effectively than the Model 2 ̆ 7 s own individual variable measure of Growth Need Strength. ^ Under voluntary confidential conditions, 202 non-professional, non-managerial employees of a State owned and operated mental hospital completed a questionnaire. The questionnaire contained the complete Hackman-Oldham Job Diagnostic Survey (JDS); a self-esteem measure; a measure of E- 2 expectancy; a turnover measure; and a measure of the expressed desire for job enrichment. ^ To facilitate comparisons the methods employed were similar to those used in developing the JDS. Separate correlation analyses were employed for the proposed moderators of self-esteem and desire for job enrichment as well as for two formats of the Model 2 ̆ 7 s moderator Growth Need Strength. Each of the four moderators was split into high, middle, and low groups with each group studied for relationships between MPS/Core <b>Job</b> <b>Dimensions</b> and selected outcome measures. Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s Z transformations were used to test differences between correlations obtained from the high and low groups. ^ Results supported the replication phase of the study. Elevated scores were noted in Task Significance, Experienced Meaningfulness of the Work, Feedback from the Job, and Internal Work Motivation. Relationships were comparable except for Absenteeism which did not relate to Core <b>Job</b> <b>Dimensions.</b> The hypothesis extending the Model to Expectancy Theory was fully supported. E- 2 expectancy measures related to Core <b>Job</b> <b>Dimensions,</b> and intrinsic E- 2 items exhibited relatively high values compared to extrinsics. Support for any of the moderator effects was weak. Each moderator affected a different constellation of Dimension/Outcome relationships. Neither self-esteem nor expressed desire for enrichment proved superior to GNS as a moderator. ^ The implications of the results of this study as they relate to a working environment where both the service recipients and employees have vital interests were discussed. Also discussed was the importance of findings in the areas of Internal Work Motivation, Experienced Meaningfulness of the Work and Job Feedback to the organization 2 ̆ 7 s clients in a working environment low in performance criteria and high in employee decision latitude. Future research in mental health treatment environments should focus on intrinsic job characteristics, intrinsic outcomes, and individual differences in global self-esteem. Longitudinal quasi-experimental field studies emphasizing the direction rather than the existence or magnitude of relationships are suggested. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} provides {{ample evidence}} that state Extension programs {{across the country are}} introducing new or modified program development approaches and reorganized work units as they attempt to remain responsive to the public 2 ̆ 7 s educational needs. Implementation of such innovations, in many instances, represents change in Extension agent roles and responsibilities which could be characterized as a redesign of Extension work. Research on the effects of job redesign has consistently found evidence that workers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of certain core dimensions or characteristics of their jobs influence their satisfaction with that job. Given the changing organizational climate within Extension and the findings of job redesign research, the present inquiry explored whether the introduction of organizational innovations changed Extension agent job perceptions and job satisfaction. Data from prior research with Nebraska Extension agents established a baseline of perceptions about the level of skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, feedback, personal satisfaction, and context satisfaction present in the job of agent. These observations, obtained before program development and work unit changes were implemented, were contrasted with agents 2 ̆ 7 current perceptions of the same factors following introduction of organizational changes. The study findings suggested that agents (n= 103) saw the <b>job</b> <b>dimensions</b> as unchanged and experienced no change in personal satisfaction. Further, new agents (n= 33) who had joined the organization after implementation of the innovations did not appear to perceive the <b>job</b> <b>dimensions</b> and personal satisfaction differently from their experienced colleagues. Satisfaction with compensation and supervision improved, while satisfaction with co-worker relations declined, among those agents experiencing the work modifications. In addition, these agents were more satisfied with job security, compensation, and supervision than were their newer colleagues. It was concluded that, over the five-year period, implementation of issues-based programming and clustered work units had not altered Extension agent perceptions of core <b>job</b> <b>dimensions</b> or levels of job satisfaction, but may have affected some aspects of satisfaction with the work context...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to examine whether the extent of {{involvement}} in Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) practices has a positive effect on job characteristics. Data was gathered from a sample of 184 respondents derived from manufacturing companies in Malaysia. Results from the regression analyses revealed that the extent of employee’s involvement in TPM practices is positively related to the five core <b>job</b> <b>dimensions</b> (skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback). Theoretical and managerial implications of the findings are discussed...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a phrase}} “You don’t leave the company; you leave a manager. ” But {{what if the}} job is {{perfectly}} designed to lead to organizational commitment: will the manager still have that much of an influence? This study examined the moderating effect of Leader-Member Exchange {{on the relationship between}} the Job Characteristics and Organizational Commitment. 220 employees from various countries and industries were surveyed regarding their current job, commitment to the organization and their relationship with their manager. Results showed that the core <b>job</b> <b>dimensions</b> based on the Job Characteristics Model were independently and uniquely related to affective and normative commitment, but not continuance commitment. Leader-Member Exchange did not moderate the relationship with any of the dimensions of commitment, but did add unique value to affective and normative commitment above and beyond the core <b>job</b> <b>dimensions.</b> Therefore, the relationship with one’s manager effects the overall employee experience and can impact organizational commitment. However, relationship with one’s manager did not moderate the relationship between the Job Characteristics and Organizational Commitment. This study provided more information regarding how managers’ actions, communication, and trust can influence the commitment of employees, even if the structure of the job encourages commitment. Organizations can therefore {{have a better understanding of}} how to retain their employees...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the factors that are {{associated}} with teachers‟ job satisfaction. A study sample of 162 (N= 162) teachers was surveyed. The descriptive statistics techniques revealed that teachers are satisfied with aspects under the following dimensions: social benefits, meaningfulness of the job and support from administration. Conversely, the teachers indicated they are least satisfied with the aspects under the <b>job</b> characteristics <b>dimension.</b> Additionally, the independent t-test and MANOVA revealed significant differences in teachers‟ job satisfaction in relation to gender, age, school location and school type, but there are no significant differences in relation to marital status, teaching experience, teacher type and promotional position in all the five core <b>job</b> <b>dimensions.</b> Moreover, the stepwise regression model revealed that the meaningfulness of the job and <b>job</b> characteristics <b>dimensions</b> contributed significantly to teachers‟ intention to remain in the job. Lastly, the bivariate correlation (Pearson r) revealed that there is a significant relationship between job satisfaction and the five job dimensions: job characteristics, social benefits, meaningfulness of the job, support from administration and intention to remain in the job. These findings are both consistent and inconsistent with the previous research findings. This study was done for school administrators, employers, policy makers, planners and school owners in Tanzania and other countries...|$|R
