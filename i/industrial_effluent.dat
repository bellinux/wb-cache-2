5|$|The Great Stink was {{an event}} in central London in July and August 1858 during which the hot weather {{exacerbated}} the smell of untreated human waste and <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> that was present {{on the banks of}} the River Thames. The problem had been mounting for some years, with an ageing and inadequate sewer system that emptied directly into the Thames. The miasma from the effluent was thought to transmit contagious diseases, and three outbreaks of cholera prior to the Great Stink were blamed on the ongoing problems with the river.|$|E
5|$|The nymph is the {{dominant}} life history stage of the mayfly. Different insect species vary in their tolerance to water pollution, but in general, the larval stages of mayflies, stoneflies (Plecoptera) and caddis flies (Trichoptera) are susceptible {{to a number of}} pollutants including sewage, pesticides and <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent.</b> In general, mayflies are particularly sensitive to acidification, but tolerances vary, and certain species are exceptionally tolerant to heavy metal contamination and to low pH levels. Ephemerellidae are among the most tolerant groups and Siphlonuridae and Caenidae the least. The adverse effects on the insects of pollution may be either lethal or sub-lethal, in the latter case resulting in altered enzyme function, poor growth, changed behaviour or lack of reproductive success. As important parts of the food chain, pollution can cause knock-on effects to other organisms; a dearth of herbivorous nymphs can cause overgrowth of algae, and a scarcity of predacious nymphs can result in an over-abundance of their prey species. Fish that feed on mayfly nymphs that have bioaccumulated heavy metals are themselves at risk. Adult female mayflies find water by detecting the polarization of reflected light. They are easily fooled by other polished surfaces which can act as traps for swarming mayflies.|$|E
25|$|In highly {{regulated}} developed countries, <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> usually receives {{at least}} pretreatment if not full {{treatment at the}} factories themselves to reduce the pollutant load, before discharge to the sewer. This process is called industrial wastewater treatment or pretreatment. The same {{does not apply to}} many developing countries where <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> is more likely to enter the sewer if it exists, or even the receiving water body, without pretreatment.|$|E

25|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{is particularly}} suited to organic material, and {{is commonly used}} for <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent,</b> wastewater and sewage sludge treatment.

25|$|An {{important}} lake {{to highlight}} located near Guatemala City is the once pristine Lake Amatitlán {{which is now}} long degraded from years of domestic and industrial dumping, and deforestation. Each year large quantities of untreated sewage, <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> and around 500,000 tons of sediment are carried into Lake Amatitlán through the lake's primary inflow source, the Villalobos River, causing high levels of water pollution and an accelerated rate of eutrophication and siltation.|$|E
25|$|Of the {{wastewater}} that enters the sewer network, only about 60% reaches the treatment plants. The most common solution used for wastewater treatment in Kenya are waste stabilisation ponds. One {{of them is}} the Dandora Waste Stabilisation Pond System which treats the industrial and domestic sewage from the city of Nairobi and is the largest pond system in Africa. Mixing <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> and domestic sewage in mixed sewer system, however, often causes poor performance in Kenyan pond treatment systems.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the costs}} of {{construction}} are high. Deep Shaft has seen the greatest uptake in Japan, because of the land area issues. Deep Shaft was developed by ICI, as a spin-off from their Pruteen process. In the UK it is found at three sites: Tilbury, Anglian water, treating a wastewater with a high industrial contribution; Southport, United Utilities, because of land space issues; and Billingham, ICI, again treating <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent,</b> and built (after the Tilbury shafts) by ICI to help the agent sell more.|$|E
25|$|It {{improves}} {{environment by}} reducing {{erosion of the}} banks and flooding of low-lying {{areas of the city}} by the walls constructed on the both banks. The new integrated sewage and storm-water system intercepts 38 former sewage and <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> discharge points and route it to sewage treatment plants south of Vasna Barrage. Thus it reduced the water pollution in the river. The water level in the river is retained through Vasna Barrage and the losing water is replenished by the Narmada Canal. It enabled the groundwater recharge and the recreational facilities like boating in the river. There are also plans to replenish river by treated sewage water.|$|E
25|$|From the 1880s {{the water}} quality {{deteriorated}} rapidly, {{as a result of}} coal mining and its associated communities. The river became unable to sustain life, and by 1974, was the most polluted of the rivers within the River Don catchment. The pollutants came from coking plants, from inefficient sewage treatment plants, and from the manufacture of chemicals. Major investment in upgrading the sewage treatment works took place, and in the treatment of <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> before it was discharged to the river. The closure of the main coking plants has also aided the recovery of the river, and enabled restocking with fish to begin in 1994. By 1996 there was evidence for self-sustaining fish populations, and that the river could support organised angling.|$|E

25|$|Sewage {{treatment}} {{may also be}} referred to as wastewater treatment, although the latter is a broader term which can also be applied to purely industrial wastewater. For most cities, the sewer system will also carry a proportion of <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> to the sewage treatment plant which has usually received pretreatment at the factories themselves to reduce the pollutant load. If the sewer system is a combined sewer then it will also carry urban runoff (stormwater) to the sewage treatment plant. Sewage water can travel towards treatment plants via piping and in a flow aided by gravity and pumps. The first part of filtration of sewage typically includes a bar screen to filter solids and large objects which are then collected in dumpsters and disposed of in landfills. Fat and grease is also removed before the primary treatment of sewage.|$|E
25|$|The river below Clayton West {{ceases to}} be a shallow, fast-flowing watercourse, and {{consists}} of deeper pools with a slower flow, which is suitable for various coarse fish as well as trout. By 1974, a modest improvement in water quality had been achieved by treatment of <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent,</b> and some fish managed to exist below the weir at the Star Paper Mill in Barnsley. The weir helped to oxygenate the water, {{and most of the}} fish had been washed downstream from Cannon Hall and Bretton Lakes. During flood conditions, many of the population would be washed further downstream, to be replaced by others from the lakes. A survey in 1982 found gudgeon, minnow and three-spined stickleback, which had increased by 1985, and over 10,000 coarse fish were released as part of a restocking programme. However, most of these were killed by serious pollution incidents that affected the river in 1987 and 1988, and incidents continued for a further three years. The sewage treatment works at Darton and Lundwood, on either side of Barnsley, were largely responsible.|$|E
25|$|The {{impacts of}} human habitation, {{particularly}} the inadequate {{treatment of sewage}} effluent, {{and the growth of}} mining in the upper reaches and the processing of metals in the Sheffield area have resulted in serious pollution of the river, and the depletion of fish stocks, to the extent that large parts of the Don contained no fish until the mid-1980s. Concerted efforts have been made to improve the water quality, by reducing the concentration of metals, the ammonia content, and the biological oxygen demand (BOD), which {{is a measure of the}} amount of oxygen that is needed by organisms to break down organic matter in the water. Sewage treatment works on the Don, notably those at Cheesebottom, on the west bank of the river at Thurgoland and Blackburn Meadows at Tinsley, have been upgraded, as has that at Darton on the River Dearne. This has led to a great improvement in ammonia levels and BOD, further aided by the construction of biological treatment facilities for the processing of <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> in the Doncaster area, while the decline in the steel industry in Sheffield has reduced the discharge of metals into the river.|$|E
50|$|The {{fast pace}} of {{economic}} growth for the Monterrey Metro Area (MMA) has placed an increasing toll on water quality as industry (ex. Electronics) has discharged untreated <b>industrial</b> <b>effluents</b> and population has grown {{at a faster rate}} than the rest of Mexico. Consequently, availability of clean water resources has been impaired by contamination from industrial and residential sources along the Rio San Juan. Another river that first became polluted from <b>industrial</b> <b>effluents</b> and then completely dry from overuse is the Santa Catarina River.|$|R

Also, irrigation by <b>industrial</b> <b>effluents</b> {{in combination with}} vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza (VAM) was used as biological control to overcome {{the harmful effects of}} pollution with heavy metals. Irrigation of plants with <b>industrial</b> <b>effluents</b> led to marked changes in growth criteria depending on plant and the stage of growth. Industrial wastewater led also to marked changes in total carbohydrates and nitrogen contents in both shoots and roots. On the other hand, combination of industrial wastewater with VAM caused an increase in the total carbohydrates and total nitrogen in shoots and roots of both wheat and bean plants. The yield components in wheat and bean were significantly increased with <b>industrial</b> <b>effluents,</b> but the biochemical concentrations were different. In wheat, the carbohydrate concentrations were increased, but protein-N and total-N were decreased, however mineral content especially Zn was increased. A reverse response was recorded with VAM. The situation was totally opposite in case of bean. Generally, bean plants were more sensitive to pollution with heavy metals, than wheat plants however this influence might also be overcome using VA...|$|R
