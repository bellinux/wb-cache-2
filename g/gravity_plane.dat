5000|$|The Hunt GravityPlane (not to be {{confused}} with the ground-based <b>gravity</b> <b>plane)</b> is a proposed gravity-powered glider by Hunt Aviation in the USA. [...] It also has aerofoil wings, improving its lift-drag ratio and making it more efficient. The GravityPlane requires a large size in order to obtain a large enough volume-to-weight ratio to support this wing structure, and no example has yet been built. Unlike a powered glider, the GravityPlane does not consume power during the climbing phase of flight. It does however consume power at the points where it changes its buoyancy between positive and negative values. Hunt claim that this can nevertheless improve the energy efficiency of the craft, similar to the improved energy efficiency of underwater gliders over conventional methods of propulsion. Hunt suggest that the low power consumption should allow the craft to harvest sufficient energy to stay aloft indefinitely. The conventional approach to this requirement is the use of solar panels in a solar-powered aircraft. Hunt has proposed two alternative approaches. One is to use a wind turbine and harvest energy from the airflow generated by the gliding motion, the other is a thermal cycle to extract energy from the differences in air temperature at different altitudes.|$|E

Consequently, conventional oversimplified distance estimations with assumption of fixed luminosity may lead to systematic bias related to the initial mass or the age, which may potentially affect {{the study of the}} evolution of the Galaxy with red clump stars.

40|$|We {{measure the}} {{rotation}} of the Milky Way stellar halo on two samples of Blue Horizontal Branch (BHB) field halo stars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with four different methods. The two samples comprise 1582 and 2563 stars respectively and reach out to 50 kpc in galactocentric distance. Two of the methods to measure rotation rely exclusively on line-of-sight velocities, namely the popular double power-law model and a direct estimate of the de-projected l. o. s. velocity. The other two techniques use the full 3 D motions: the radial velocity based rotation estimator of Schönrich, Binney & Asplund (2012) and a simple 3 D azimuthal velocity mean. In this context we a) critique the popular model and b) assess the reliability of the estimators. All four methods agree on a weakly prograde or non-rotating halo. Further, we observe no duality in {{the rotation of}} sub-samples with different metallicities or at different radii. We trace the rotation gradient across metallicity measured by Deason et al. (2011) on a similar sample of BHB stars back to the inclusion of regions in the apparent magnitude-surface <b>gravity</b> <b>plane</b> known to be contaminated. In the spectroscopically selected sample of Xue et al.

They show a seemingly retrograde behaviour in line-of-sight velocities, which is not confirmed by the 3 D estimators. Their anomalous vertical motion hints at either a pipeline problem or a stream-like component rather than a smooth retrograde population.

40|$|NASA is {{currently}} designing a new space suit capable {{of working in}} deep space and on Mars. Designing a suit is very difficult and often requires tradeoffs between performance, cost, mass, and system complexity. Our current understanding of human performance in reduced gravity in a planetary environment (the moon or Mars) is limited to lunar observations, studies from the Apollo program, and recent suit tests conducted at JSC using reduced gravity simulators. This study will look at our most recent reduced gravity simulations performed on the new Active Response Gravity Offload System (ARGOS) compared to the C 9 reduced <b>gravity</b> <b>plane.</b> Methods: Subjects ambulated in reduced gravity analogs to obtain a baseline for human performance. Subjects were tested in lunar gravity (1. 6 m/sq s) and Earth gravity (9. 8 m/sq s) in shirtsleeves. Subjects ambulated over ground at prescribed speeds on the ARGOS, but ambulated at a selfselected speed on the C 9 due to time limitations. Subjects on the ARGOS were given over 3 minutes to acclimate to the different conditions before data was collected. Nine healthy subjects were tested in the ARGOS (6 males, 3 females, 79. 5 +/- 15. 7 kg), while six subjects were tested on the C 9 (6 males, 78. 8 +/- 11. 2 kg). Data was collected with an optical motion capture system (Vicon, Oxford, UK) and was analyzed using customized analysis scripts in BodyBuilder (Vicon, Oxford, UK) and MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Results: In all offloaded conditions, variation between subjects increased compared to 1 g. Kinematics in the ARGOS at lunar gravity resembled earth gravity ambulation more closely than the C 9 ambulation. Toeoff occurred 10 % earlier in both reduced gravity environments compared to earth gravity, shortening the stance phase. Likewise, ankle, knee, and hip angles remained consistently flexed and had reduced peaks compared to earth gravity. Ground reaction forces in lunar gravity (normalized to Earth body weight) were 0. 4 +/- 0. 2 on the ARGOS, but only 0. 2 +/- 0. 1 on the C 9. Discussion: Gait analysis showed differences in joint kinematics and temporalspatial parameters between the reduced gravity simulators and with respect to earth gravity. Although most of the subjects chose a somewhat unique ambulation style {{as a result of}} learning to ambulate in a new environment, all but two were consistent with keeping an Earthlike gait. Learning how reduced gravity affects ambulation will help NASA to determine optimal suit designs, influence mission planning, help train crew, and may shed light on the underlying methods the body uses to optimize gait for energetic efficiency. Conclusion: Kinematic and kinetic analysis demonstrated noteworthy differences between an offloaded environment and 1 g, as would be expected. The analysis showed a trend to change the ambulation style in an offloaded environment to a rollingloping walk (resembling crosscountry skiing) with increased swing time. This ambulation modification, particularly in the ARGOS, indicated that the relative kinetic energy of the subject was increased, on average, per the static body weight compared to the 1 g condition. How much of this was influenced by the active offloading of the ARGOS system is unknown...|$|E

Next we will consider such regions with variable boundaries. These boundaries change with a certain parameter. As the parameter changes, the center of the gravity of the region changes, and Mathematica can be used to study the locus of the center of gravity. We will also show how to use Mathematica to make animations of the center of gravity as the parameter changes. Some theorems on the center of gravity of these regions will be obtained.
