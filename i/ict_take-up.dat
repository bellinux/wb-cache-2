The industrial {{age and the}} market economy have moulded agriculture in their image {{just as much as}} the characteristics and tools of the information age have recently been transforming its previous operation. Information and communication technology (<b>ICT)</b> <b>take-up</b> in agriculture remains low, and the reasons behind this barely changed in the last 20 - 30 years. Information technologies are regarded as mediating channels and a vehicle for new services. It is important to research the various aspects of adoption of newinformation technology, and also not only the use, but the “effective use” of it (Gurstein, 2003). Information-intensive agriculture is fundamentally determined by information, knowledge and the decision-making farmers, in effect the human factor; therefore, studies aimed at the improvement of the situation of agriculture with ICT tools must be centred on the human element...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The article {{investigates the}} take-up of ICT by SMEs {{with less than}} 10 employees, i. e. micro-enterprises. Despite their {{economic}} weight in European economy and their significance within a more flexible network economy, these very small businesses are {{to a large extent}} underexposed in research and policy. Especially with regard to ICT adoption and use, there is only limited understanding of the bottlenecks for business owners of micro-enterprises. This often leads to inaccurate presuppositions and interpretations in research and also in policy. Insights based on large businesses are for example deemed to be easily transposable to the very small businesses. For a more substantiated view on this issue the article first identifies the main enabling and constraining factors for their <b>ICT</b> <b>take-up</b> based on socio-economic research in Flanders (Belgium). Next all the major European policy initiatives are analysed and assessed. For this the successive EU policy documents are being examined and discussed, particularly those that link enterprise policy and information society policy to SMEs. Based on the findings of this analysis some alternative policy approaches for supporting ICT acceptance by micro-enterprises are suggested, starting from a user-oriented perspective of the smal...|$|E

Moreover the project has the objective of identifying and reviewing the needs in terms of research and systems integration {{as well as at}} accelerating implementation and <b>take-up.</b> <b>ICT</b> 4 E 2 B Forum bases its roadmapping activities on the outputs of REEB project that has already developed a high-level roadmap on ICT for Energy Efficient Buildings. Starting from this expert-based work, ICT 4 E 2 B Forum intends to promote, through community building activities, a better understanding, a closer dialogue and a more active cooperation between researchers, end-users/practitioners, building owners, technology-suppliers, and software. The exploitation of ICT is consider the adding value in order to support informed decision-making (both human and automated) in the current delivery and in the use of sustainable and energy-efficient buildings and districts. By accomplishing these objectives, ICT 4 E 2 B Forum is mapping the sector-specific priorities into a common view and vocabulary, thereby enabling communication and understanding between experts in different sectors that need to join forces in order that fundamental improvements in energy efficient buildings can be achieved. All this coordination work will support in defining future research directions as well as in channelling efforts, while favouring consensus buildings on the roadmap itself...|$|R

Developing communities of practice within and outside higher education institutions. British Journal of Educational Technology. 39 (3) : 433 – 442. DOI:  10. 1111 /j. 1467 - 8535. 2008. 00841. x., which has been published in final form at: [URL] education institutions (HEIs) are largely built {{on the assumption that}} learning is an individual process best encouraged by explicit teaching that is, on the whole, separated from social engagement with those outside the university community. This perspective has been theoretically challenged by those who argue for a social constructivist learning theory and a more collaborative approach to learning. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) afford lecturers and students an opportunity for extending the boundaries of a learning experience, not merely beyond the lone individual, but beyond the limits of discipline boundaries within a specific university community and beyond the institution into the local community. This paper illustrates how a collaborative effort between lecturers and students from the Computer Science and Education Departments at Rhodes University, teachers from the local community, the provincial Department of Education and a non-governmental organisation developed into an unfolding virtual and physical community of practice which enabled <b>ICT</b> <b>take-up</b> in a number of schools in the Grahamstown District, South Africa. This discussion of what has become known as the e-Yethu project provides an example of how ICTs, underpinned by the insights of social constructivism, the notion of 'community of practice' and in particular Hoadley and Kilner's C 4 P Framework for Communities of Practice, can serve to help HEIs understand ways in which ICTs can provide opportunities for developing collaborative learning within HEIs, and between the HEI and the local community...|$|E

Full text thesisAgriculture is the backbone of the Kenyan economy and directly contributes to Gross Domestic Product of 25 %. Maize is the major staple food and majority of Kenyan‟s cultivate it. The future of food security and welfare of the farming population will depend largely on increasing the production of maize. <b>ICT</b> <b>take-up</b> in agriculture in Kenya remains low and the agricultural communities have yet to fully embrace the potential benefits of ICT. The effective use of ICTs by maize farmers can improve their operation and support them to achieve their objectives, for example, access to information and services, social inclusion, cultural provision, education and training. The adoption of ICT among maize farmers needs to be approached in a holistic and sustainable fashion that will support their operation and enhance their productivity. The study set to establish the role of ICT in agricultural processes, factors that influence ICT use and review of various ICT technology models. The research further reviewed studies using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) {{in order to create a}} modified model and instrument to study the acceptance of ICT technologies by Maize farmers. In this study, we examined the relationships between the TAM constructs in some of the research that purports to explain the variance in the acceptance of different information technologies. Based upon the empirical research using the technology assessment model, a modified TAM was developed for the adoption of ICT‟s by maize farmers. The original constructs (belief, behaviour, attitude and use) were retained from TAM while the literature suggests subjective norms, government support, ICT vendors‟ support, and perceived socio economic factors to be useful antecedents for predicting perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and behavioural intent to use. Hypotheses were discussed in this study related to the theoretical relationships between constructs and antecedents. A survey instrument was developed using existing scales from prior TAM instruments and modified them where appropriate. The resultant instrument can be used in future to test how farmers adopt and accept ICT‟s technologies. The study showed also that all the constructs of TAM had a positive correlation on ICT use and the external variables of ICT vendor support, Subjective Norms and perceived socio-economic support. Government support reported a relatively low correlation to ICT use. Agriculture is the backbone of the Kenyan economy and directly contributes to Gross Domestic Product of 25 %.

40|$|Great {{effort is}} being made to get Europe out of its {{economic}} crisis and prepare the European economy for the next decade. The aims of the Digital Agenda are to give all Europeans basic broadband by 2013 {{and to ensure that}} by 2020 all Europeans have access to much higher internet speeds. Can DTN technology contribute to achieving these targets in rural and remote areas? In the N 4 C project DTN technology has taken a step toward these goals and been proven viable. This licentiate thesis is meant to suggest business and governance models suitable for the N 4 C DTN-based internet access, the test beds and the applications. The focus is on reviewing and assessing business models for Open Source Software (OSS) and offering solutions for testing whether DTN-based internet access can be governed in an economic association as an ICT commons. Gender and cultural considerations in N 4 C business and deployment development are analysed. It is shown that to improve the gender balance special measures need to be considered. It is concluded that in countries such as Sweden, where women have almost the same <b>ICT</b> <b>take-up</b> and usage as men, i. e., women are good ICT-consumers, their role as entrepreneurs, developers and participants in governance of ICT infrastructure needs to be improved. Ostrom’s eight design principles for governing, with division of roles into appropriators, producers and providers, have been tested on N 4 C in the entity of an economic association, with illuminating results. However, when such governance models are used in projects like N 4 C, they cannot be transferred outright, as the appropriation from the internet is different from withdrawal of resources from other types of commons. It was found that the provision formulas, especially for labour, are important, because in the N 4 C DTN-based internet access the producer in the model is often acting as a “data mule,” transporting the code. To assure gender-inclusive governance when economic associations are being used, Ostrom’s eight design principles for governing is proposed to be surrounded with special measures.
