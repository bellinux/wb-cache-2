60|$|I {{have never}} seen nor been enform'd of the true manner of the growing of Sponges on the Rock; whether they are found to {{increase}} from little to great, like Vegetables, that is, part after part, or like Animals, all parts equally growing together; or whether they be matrices or feed-baggs {{of any kind of}} Fishes, or some kind of watry Insect; or whether they are at any times more soft and tender, or of another nature and texture, which things, if I knew how, I should much desire to be informed of: but from a cursory view that I at first made with my Microscope, and some other trials, I supposed it to be some Animal substance cast out, and fastned upon the Rocks {{in the form of a}} froth, or congeries of bubbles, like that which I have often observ'd on Rosemary, and other Plants (wherein is included a little Insect) that all the little films which divide these bubbles one from another, did presently, almost after the substance began to grow a little harder, break, and leave onely the thread behind, which might be, as 'twere, the angle or thread between the bubbles, that the great holes or pores observable in these Sponges were made by the eruption of the included Heterogeneous substance (whether air, or some other body, for many other fluid bodies will do the same thing) which breaking out of the lesser, were collected into very large bubbles, and so might make their way out of the Sponge, and in their passage might leave a round cavity; and if it were large, might carry up with it the adjacent bubbles, which may be perceiv'd at the outside of the Sponge, if it be first throughly wetted, and sufferr'd to plump itself into its natural form, or be then wrung dry, and suffer'd to expand it self again, which it will freely do whil'st moist: for when it has thus plump'd it self into its natural shape and dimensions, 'tis obvious enough that the mouths of the larger holes have a kind of lip or rising round about them, but the other smaller pores have little or none. It may further be found, that each of these great pores has many other small pores below, that are united unto it, and help to constitute it, almost like so many rivulets or small streams that contribute to the maintenance of a large River. Nor from this Hypothesis would it have been difficult to explicate, how those little branches of Coral, smal Stones, shells, and the like, come to be included by these frothy bodies: But this <b>inded</b> was but a conjecture; and upon a more accurate enquiry into the form of it with the Microscope, it seems not to be the true origine of them; for whereas Sponges have onely three arms which join together at each knot, if they had been generated from bubbles they must have had four.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{implementation}} of a data parallel system. A sequential knowledge-based deductive and inductive system, <b>INDED</b> (pronounced &quot;indeed&quot;), {{is transformed into a}} parallel system. In this parallel system the learning algorithm, the fundamental component of the induction engine, is distributed among many processors. The parallel system is implemented with a master node and several worker nodes. The master node is responsible for coordinating the activity of the worker nodes, and organizing the overall learning process. All the worker nodes share the processing of the basic induction algorithms and report their results to the master node. The goal of the data parallel system is to produce, more efficiently, rules that are equal to or better than those produced by the serial system. In this paper, we present the architecture of the parallel version of <b>INDED,</b> and comparison results involving execution speeds and quality of generated rules of the new parallel system to those of the serial system.

However, it is often unclear as to what this emergent behaviour can be, or <b>inded</b> how large the system should be for such behaviour to arise. In this paper we will address these problems for the specific case of an electrical network comprising a mixture of resistive and reactive elements. Using this model we will show, using some spectral theory, the types of emergent behaviour that we expect and also how large a system we need for this to be observed...|$|E
40|$|Hypergraphs {{are often}} used to {{represent}} knowledge bases because of their accurate depiction of causal links between facts. Deduction can be computed over such a knowledge base by complete hypergraph traversal. Efficient structuring of such hypergraphs can reduce time in deductive computation as well as space in vertex and hyperedge storage. In this work, we transform a hypergraph storing a knowledge base into a more efficient representation. By representing {{only part of the}} ground instantiation of the internal knowledge base, we attain a great space reduction. This partial representation is accomplished by storing non-ground, intensional predicates and by performing individual instantiations on these. In this paper, we present the implementation of these techniques and compare them to those used in computer system <b>INDED</b> (pronounced "indeed") ...|$|E
40|$|We present stable ILP, a cross-disciplinary concept {{straddling}} {{machine learning}} and nonmonotonic reasoning. Stable models {{give meaning to}} logic programs containing negative assertions. In stable ILP, we employ stable models to represent the current state specified by (possibly) negative EDB and IDB rules. The state then serves as the background knowledge for a top-down ILP learner. We present a framework and implementation (system <b>INDED)</b> of one realization of stable ILP. 1 Introduction A semantics of a logic program {{can be thought of}} as a function which produces the entire set of facts which are logically implied by the program. A semantics, therefore, states which propositions mentioned in the program are considered true, and which are considered false. There is a standard for establishing truth and falsity of propositions in logic programs with no negative literals. There is, however, quite a bit of controversy over the interpretation of negative propositions such as "moths do no [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-five {{years have}} elapsed since the {{publication}} of Benjamin S. Bloom's article titled "Learning for Mastery. " With approximately 2, 000 master learning/testing citations in the ERIC data base alone, Bloom's 1968 piece is <b>inded</b> one of the most generative works to appear in the educational psychology literature in decades. At this quarter-century juncture, then, it is appropriate to reflect retrospectively and prospectively on the meaning, impact, and continuing possibilities of Bloom's learning for mastery. In so doing, this paper focuses on what could be termed the "internationalization " of mastery learning. Evidence of mastery learning research and development initiatives in well over 30 nations does indeed invite not only an analysis of what has already transpired in the worldwide community but also a projection of future directions for mastery learning in the international arena.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{implementation}} of speculative parallelism {{in the realm}} of deductive and inductive reasoning systems. Machine learning, a form of induction, {{can be thought of as}} a search for a generalizing rule that summarizes a collection of data. In this work, we broach the search for such a rule by simultaneously traversing the search space at ten different starting points; ten ranking algorithms are executed simultaneously on a distributed architecture. Additionally, we present a data parallel design where each learning algorithm, itself, is distributed among many processors. We exemplify these concepts of speculative and data parallel parallelism by transforming a sequential knowledge-based deduction and induction system, <b>INDED,</b> into a speculatively parallel system where several processors simultaneously search for an accurate rule obtained in a supervised learning environment. Moreover, a data parallel implementation of the fundamental operation of each learning algorithm, ranking, is parallelized among the cluster nodes. We present algorithms for work delegation as well as final rule assessment used in selection of the superior learned rule...|$|E
