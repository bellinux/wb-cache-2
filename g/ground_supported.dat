25|$|In 1969, the RLAF's advisors {{started a}} couple of {{programs}} aimed at raising the T-28 pilots' morale. Most immediate was a combat pay bonus paid for every strike sortie flown. Escape and evasion training was also offered in Hua Hin, Thailand; it also doubled as seaside R. However, with no stand-down, operations continued. On 27 June 1969, the advanced RLAF base at Muang Soui was overrun by North Vietnamese sappers and infantry. On 11 July 1969, {{the most famous of}} the Hmong pilots, Captain Lee Lue, was shot down and killed after flying over 1,000 combat sorties in less than 18 months. Between April and September 1969, the first two Lao forward air controllers were trained. In late 1969, the Hmong mercenaries on the <b>ground,</b> <b>supported</b> by RLAF and U. S. air strikes, recaptured most of the Plaine des Jarres. The first three AC-47 Spooky gunships were received from the U. S. and Vietnamese Air Forces, and the first missions flown on 5 September. There were teething problemsair crews were expected to fly C-47s by day as well as AC-47s at night; gunners burned out guns; munitions were fired just for resale value of the brass; Vang Pao was initially reluctant to employ them for fear of friendly casualties. The experience of the pilots helped though; for instance, Captain Khamphanh (of the air-to-air victory) had logged over 7,000 flying hours. Nevertheless, the three Spookies soon proved their worth and began averaging about 50 nocturnal combat sorties per month.|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, {{funding was}} secured from Ontario’s SuperBuild program {{to build a}} fifth {{extension}} to the Main Building. Through Rod Robbie of Robbie/Young + Wright Architects, Will Alsop of Alsop Architects was {{made aware of the}} project and was eventually selected in 2002. A joint venture was formed between the two firms and the new building, now known as the Sharp Centre for Design, was completed in 2004. The design, which came out of a process of participatory design, consists of a box four storeys off the <b>ground</b> <b>supported</b> by a series of multi-coloured pillars at different angles and is often described as a tabletop. The $42.5-million expansion and redevelopment has received numerous awards, including the first Royal Institute of British Architects Worldwide Award, the award of excellence in the [...] "Building in Context" [...] category at the Toronto Architecture and Urban Design Awards, and was deemed the most outstanding technical project overall in the 2005 Canadian Consulting Engineering Awards.|$|E

60|$|Immense {{clouds of}} white smoke had been pouring over {{the summit of}} the mountain, and had {{concealed}} the approach and ravages of the element; but a crackling sound drew the eyes of Miss Temple, as she flew over the <b>ground</b> <b>supported</b> by the young man, toward the outline of smoke where she already perceived the waving flames shooting forward from the vapor, now flaring high in the air, and then bending to the earth, seeming to light into combustion every stick and shrub on which they breathed. The sight aroused them to redoubled efforts; but, unfortunately, a collection of the tops of trees, old and dried, lay directly across their course; and at the very moment when both had thought their safety insured, the warm current of the air swept a forked tongue of flame across the pile, which lighted at the touch; and when they reached the spot, the flying pair were opposed by the surly roaring of a body of fire, as if a furnace were glowing in their path. They recoiled from the heat, and stood on a point of the rock, gazing in a stupor at the flames which were spreading rap idly down the mountain, whose side, too, became a sheet of living fire. It was dangerous for one clad in the light and airy dress of Elizabeth to approach even the vicinity of the raging element; and those flowing robes, that gave such softness and grace to her form, seemed now to be formed for the instruments of her destruction.|$|E

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{defines a}} complete set of <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> functions based on those practiced in real space flight operations during the on-orbit phase of a mission. These functions are mapped against <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> functions currently in use by NASA and DOD. Software components to provide these functions can be hosted on RISC-based work stations and integrated to provide a modular, integrated <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> system. Such modular systems can be configured to provide as much <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> functionality as desired. This approach to ground systems has been widely proposed and prototyped both by government institutions and commercial vendors. The combined set of <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> functions we describe {{can be used as a}} standard to evaluate candidate ground systems. This approach has also been used to develop a prototype of a modular, loosely-integrated <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> system, which is discussed briefly. A crucial benefit to a potential user is that all the components are flight-qualified, thus giving high confidence in their accuracy and reliability...|$|R
40|$|In deep {{underground}} mining, <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> {{represents a}} significant {{component of the}} total mining cost. Serious failure of the <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> system in such high stress areas, and particularly in burst prone ground, can result in production delays, loss of reserves, damage to equipment, injuries, etc., the cost of which greatly exceeds the original <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> cost. Historically, the major problem has been the inability of engineering and operations staff to evaluate the “as placed ” status of a <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> system, {{with any degree of}} confidence, as the mining front progresses. The development of “direct <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> instrumentation ” [e. g. SMART cable bolts; SMART contractometers] combined with conventional geomechanical instrumentation [e. g. microseismic monitoring systems; Multiple Position Borehole Extensometers; stress cells; etc. ] provides the ability to evaluate <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> behaviour and available support capacity in real time. Such data is invaluable in assessing critical operational factors such as safe access to mine openings, the need for and timing of rehabilitation, the performance and safety of pillars, and backfill behaviour, etc. The use of instrumentation systems and their impact on the direct <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> and mining costs are discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Eko-Remaja uranium {{exploration}} tunnel, Kalan, West Kalimantan {{is one of}} the important facilities for uranium deposit research. The tunnel was built in 1980 with a length of 618 meters penetrating Eko Hill on both sides. The rock inside the tunnel is relatively compact, but it has weak zones in some area. <b>Ground</b> <b>supporting</b> is a method used to overcome the soil and rock collapses which occurred in the tunnel weak zones. Installation of <b>ground</b> <b>supporting</b> system throughout the recent time based on the soil collapse pattern, which occurred when the tunnel opened without any specific study related to rock mass characterization and the requirement of <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> system. This research conducted to evaluate the safety level of Eko-Remaja tunnel and the suitability of <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> location. The evaluation performed by comparing the rock mass characteristics using Rock Mass Rating (RMR) method between the installed rock support and uninstalled rock support locations. Based on the analysis result, RMR value on the installed <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> is classified as class IV or poor rock. Meanwhile, on uninstalled location, the rock is classified as class II or fair rock. Based on the correlation between RMR calculation result and Eko-Remaja tunnel roof span, it is concluded that tunnel <b>ground</b> <b>supports</b> position which are represented by observation location on 38 m, 73 m, and 165 m depth are suitable with rock mass characterization system using RMR method...|$|R

Like many buildings in Venice, it is built on soft <b>ground,</b> <b>supported</b> by wooden piles.

The titanium ring will protect the campanile from the shifting soil and ensure that the tower subsides equally and does not lean.|$|E
