5000|$|Hulbert Footner, novelist, {{playwright and}} historian, died {{unexpectedly}} tonight {{at his home}} of a heart attack. His age was 65. A Canadian by birth, he came to Maryland almost thirty-five years ago. He began writing professionally {{as a young man}} and most of his early books were adventure and detective novels.

His last book Rivers of the Eastern Shore, was published <b>early</b> <b>this</b> <b>month</b> and he was preparing a somewhat similar work on Tidewater Virginia. One of his plays, Shirley Kaye, was produced on Broadway almost thirty years ago with Elsie Ferguson in the starring role. Mr. Footner had been a prolific writer since 1911 and turned out many novels of adventure and mystery, but found time for other works, such as New York: City of Cities in 1937, praised by critics as amusing and instructive. He also wrote widely about Maryland, his adopted state. In 1916 he married Gladys Marsh. Four children were born of the union. They were Mary Ann, Phoebe, Jane and Geoffrey.

40|$|This week 2 ̆ 7 s summit aims to {{save the}} embattled {{healthcare}} overhaul {{through the power of}} persuasion, writes Lesley Russell in Inside Story HEALTHCARE REFORM is back on the agenda in Washington this week and in a big way. Since things came to an unexpected and screeching halt after the Massachusetts election, which cost the Democrats their super-majority in the Senate, the daily news on spiralling health costs has helped to drive the recognition that reform is imperative. To give one example: WellPoint’s Anthem Blue Cross in California, one of the largest health insurers in the state, announced <b>early</b> <b>this</b> <b>month</b> that it was about to hike health insurance premiums by as much as 39 per cent for individuals. A recent survey by the Center for American Progress shows double-digit hikes in insurance premiums implemented or pending in at least ten other states. Meanwhile, the five biggest health insurance companies in the United States have collectively reported a record profit for 2009, even as they covered fewer customers. The economic crisis is making it increasingly difficult for middle-class families to keep up their health insurance payments.

40|$|The Schengen {{system has}} been at the centre of sharp {{controversy}} throughout 2011 and the early months of 2012 arising from attempts by several member state governments to challenge the right to the free movement of persons and the abolition of internal border checks. The speech delivered by Nicolas Sarkozy <b>early</b> <b>this</b> <b>month</b> (March 2012), as part of the French presidential campaign, in which he threatened to suspend France’s participation in Schengen illustrates this phenomenon. This paper examines the European Commission’s response to the Schengen controversies, namely the Schengen Goverance Package published in September 2011 and currently under negotiation in Council and the European Parliament. It assesses the scope and added value of the Package’s two new legislative proposals (a new Schengen evaluation mechanism and revised rules for restating internal border checks) by looking at the origins and features of the debate surrounding liberty of circulation in the Schengen area. The paper addresses the following questions: first, are these new rules necessary and appropriate to effectively respond to unlawful security derogations and restrictions to liberty of circulation? Second, would their adoption provide an effective response to current and future political tensions and national governments’ policies against free movement, such as those evidenced in 2011 and 2012 and for them to expand to other member states? And finally, is the Schengen Governance Package well designed to safeguard the free movement of persons, or is it rather oriented towards further strengthening the security apparatus of Schengen...|$|E
40|$|I wish {{to recall}} that, {{in line with}} the {{decision}} adopted by the Peace and Security Council (PSC) at its 142 nd meeting held on 21 July 2008, calling for the formation of an AU High‐Level Panel on Darfur (AUPD), I appointed several eminent African personalities as members of the AUPD. The PSC decision was subsequently endorsed by the 12 th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the Union held from 1 to 3 February 2009. The AUPD, which is chaired by former President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, was mandated to examine the situation in Darfur in‐depth and submit recommendations on how best to effectively and comprehensively address the issues of accountability and combating impunity, on the one hand, and peace, healing and reconciliation, on the other. In this context, the AUPD convened its inaugural meeting in Addis Ababa on 18 and 19 March 2009. This inaugural meeting was followed by wide consultations with both the Sudanese and international stakeholders. The Panel completed its work <b>early</b> <b>this</b> <b>month</b> and formally submitted its report to me on 8 October 2009. The Commission fully associates itself with the recommendations contained in the report and believes that they provide a clear roadmap on how best the interrelated issues of peace, justice, reconciliation and healing could be addressed in Darfur, thereby contributing to the overall objective of promoting sustainable peace and stability in the Sudan. It is my earnest hope that the PSC will seize the opportunity of the consideration of the report to further enhance Africa’s leadership in guiding the International community’s efforts to help Sudan and the Sudanese people attain peace, security, reconciliation and justice.

40|$|Some of {{the things}} {{discussed}} in this report are: (1) Computation [...] NAL is now obtaining satisfactory service on NYU's 6600 computer via the telephone data link. Until {{about two weeks ago}} we were plagued by numerous breakdowns of the computer itself (one lasting about three weeks), and bugs in the NYU programs that control the transmission. <b>Early</b> <b>this</b> <b>month</b> a two month complete rebuilding of the NYU computer was begun. During this period Control Data Corporation is making a new computer at their Manhattan data center available to NYU and to the remote-terminal users. This computer is reasonably reliable, and the most serious bugs have apparently been removed from the transmission system. NAL now has immediate access to the computer {{for most of the day}} and turn-around time for jobs with moderate amounts of output is often less than one hour. We have always received excellent service and help from Argonne's Applied Mathematics Division, which has made its two computers, a CDC 3600 and an IBM 360 - 75, available to us. At present we have a courier service to Argonne making three trips a day, soon to be extended to five. In addition IBM is furnishing very competent personnel to help convert 6600 programs to the 360. (2) Main-Ring Lattice [...] A small adjustment has been made in the quadrupoles of the long straight sections. Since the beam cross section is greatest there, these quadrupoles have been increased in aperture. To preserve focal length and pole-tip field, their length was also increased at the expense of about a meter of straight section length. The lattice is quite stable against changes of v. If all the quadrupole gradients are increased or decreased proportionately to cover a range of v between 18. 5 and 22, the maximum increase in B is less than 20 %, except for the stopland at v = 21 of width {Delta}v {approx_equal} {+-} 0. 1, due to the structure resonance arising from the six -fold periodicity. (3) Injection Energy [...] A study was made of the appropriate injection energy for a 5 Hz booster to be used in connection with the accumulator ring. Both cost and performance were considered. The conclusion is that 200 MeV is still the most desirable injection energy for such a booster. (4) Main-Ring Magnet Computations [...] The design work using the computer program TRIM for the main ring bending magnet is continuing. The effort so far indicates that field shapes well within acceptable tolerance can be obtained up to at least 18 kG without crenellation for both B 1 and B 2 magnets and the degree of saturation can be made quite small (about 3. 5 % at 18 kG) and equal for both magnets. The proper coil configurations are 4 turns out of 12 placed between poles for B 1 and 4 turns out of 16 placed in between poles for B 2. With these coil configurations, the proper pole widths are approximately 8. 5 in. for B 1 and 8. 8 in. for B 2. (5) Secondary Beams [...] Studies are being made with A. L. Read of possible secondary beam layouts. One scheme is to channel a secondary beam through bending magnets and a set of three quadrupole triplets producing 3600 phase advance from source to target, with a momentum-analyzing slit at an image point 1800 downstream...|$|E
