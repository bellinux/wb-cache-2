40|$|Elimination of {{congenital}} shortening {{of lower}} limb still remains {{a complex and}} unsolved orthopaedic task which requires an improved fixation technique as well as adjusted tactics of treatment and rehabilitation procedures. Purpose of the study — experimental approval of <b>femur</b> <b>lengthening</b> technique by external fixation with Ilizarov apparatus and internal fixation by plate. Materials and methods. <b>Femur</b> <b>lengthening</b> was performed in 6 mongrel dogs. Average animal age was 1, 5 ± 0, 3 years, average weight — 20 ± 5 kg, femur length — 22 ± 2 sm. External apparatus with two supports and a titanium plate of an original design were applied under general anesthesia on the right femur of animals. Lengthening was performed manually {{at a rate of}} 1 mm per day in 4 stages at a distance of 10 % from initial segment length. External apparatus was removed {{on the last day of}} distraction after locking the plate. X-ray examination was done on the day of surgery, in 7, 14 and 25 days from the onset of distraction as well as in 14, 30, 60 and 90 days after completion of distraction and removal of external apparatus. Three animals were taken out of experiment in 30 days of fixation, remaining three animals — in 90 days. After euthanasia the authors performed autopsy of the organic femur complex and tissues contacting the plate. Results. The use of operated limb was not restricted during the whole distraction period. The authors observed first roentgenological signs of distraction osteogenesis on 7 th day of lengthening. By the end of distraction period, at 25 th day, shadows of regenerates demonstrated longitudinal striated structures in all cases. Median lucency area of 1 – 5 mm was located diagonally and across the regenerate or was intermittent. In 60 days of fixation X-rays demonstrated homogeneous regenerate. External fixation index was 13, 9 ± 1, 5 days/sm (p ≤ 0, 05). The authors observed no cases of implants fracture or deformity during the experiment.   Conclusion. Application of the developed plate in combination with external apparatus demonstrated high efficiency for <b>femur</b> <b>lengthening</b> in experiment study. </p...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} {{demonstrate}} that the lengthening technique of an external fixator associated with locked intramedullary nail is an efficient method that decreases the duration of the external fixation and improves the rehabilitation period. METHODS: From January of 2005 to May of 2014, 31 patients with mean lower limb discrepancy of 5. 31 cm were treated. The etiologies of the deformity were femur fracture sequelae, infection, hip development dysplasia, polio, and congenital short femur. RESULTS: The mean duration of external fixation was 2. 47 months (external fixation index of 16. 15 days per cm). The mean time for bone healing was 6. 66 months (consolidation index 43 days per cm). Initial mean knee range of motion was - 1 ° to 100 °, progressing to 0 °- 115 ° at the end of treatment. The complications observed were incomplete osteotomies, hip subluxation, broken fixator, decreased knee range of motion, and need for locking screw removal. CONCLUSION: <b>Femur</b> <b>lengthening</b> with a monoplanar external fixator associated with locked intramedullary nail allowed for a shorter period of external fixation use, better protection for the regenerated bone tissue, and early rehabilitation with possible complications...|$|E
40|$|Limb-lengthening {{procedures}} {{include a}} series of radiographic examinations to follow the lengthening process and callus formation. We quantified ionizing radiation exposure during lengthening treatment and estimated {{the risks associated with}} this exposure in 53 patients undergoing lengthening procedures. Field size and tube voltage of all radiographs and fluoroscopy time during surgery were recorded. According to conversion factor tables of organ doses, the cumulative organ dose was estimated. Location of lengthening, age, complications during lengthening procedure, range of lengthening, healing index, and other factors affecting the duration of the lengthening procedures were analyzed. Average lengthening was 4. 8  cm (range, 3. 0 – 12. 5  cm). The average cumulative organ dose for a straight lengthening procedure was 3. 1  mSv (range, 0. 2 – 12. 5  mSv). The average organ dose per centimeter of lengthening was 0. 7  mSv/cm (range, 0. 03 – 5. 9  mSv/cm). Doses for patients with tibial lengthening (0. 3  mSv/cm) were less than doses for patients with femoral lengthening (1. 1  mSv/cm). Age, complications, range of lengthening, and healing index did not influence the dosage of radiation per centimeter lengthening.

40|$|Extension {{contracture}} of {{the knee}} is a common complication of femoral lengthening. Knee flexion exercises to stretch the contracture with physical therapy can be effective but take a prolonged {{amount of time to}} work and place increased stress across the patellofemoral joint. We developed a minimal-incision limited quadricepsplasty surgical technique to treat knee extension contracture secondary to femoral lengthening and retrospectively reviewed 16 patients treated with this procedure. The mean age of the patients was 23  years. Range of motion {{of the knee}} and quadriceps strength were recorded preoperatively, after <b>femur</b> <b>lengthening</b> but before additional surgery, after quadricepsplasty, and at each followup. The mean femoral lengthening performed was 4. 4  cm. We compared range of motion and time to regain knee flexion with those of historical controls. The minimum followup after quadricepsplasty was 6  months (mean, 38  months; range, 6 – 84  months). The mean range of motion was 129 ° preoperatively, 29 ° after the distraction phase of femoral lengthening, and 108 ° after limited quadricepsplasty, and at final followup, the mean knee flexion was 125 °. There were no major complications. Limited quadricepsplasty improved knee flexion after a knee extension contracture developed secondary to femoral lengthening.

30|$|Growth {{inhibition}} {{has been}} reported after tibial lengthening for FH [30]. Sharma et al. [30] concluded that this is related to complete fibular aplasia. Most of the cases presented by Sharma et al. were treated with double-level or combined <b>femur</b> and tibial <b>lengthening</b> without soft tissue release. Hope et al. [31], who used only single-level lengthening, could not demonstrate any growth inhibition. Sabharwal et al.

30|$|In {{paediatric}} limb-lengthening, {{approaches for}} the prophylactic stabilisation of <b>lengthened</b> <b>femurs</b> in children include Rush® pins, unreamed interlocking nails [22] or flexible intramedullary nailing (FIN) [23]—“lengthening then rodding”. However, {{when using the}} FIN technique, manipulating the bone during frame removal or nail implant can lead to fractures. In 101 femoral lengthening operations, Schiedel et al. observed five fractures occurring in connection with fixator removal and then seven more in connection with in situ FIN [22]. Another disadvantage of the technique is the risk of infection due to the one-stage change from the external to the internal fixation.|$|R

40|$|Background: Treatment of {{leg length}} {{inequality}} via lengthening of the shorter extremity is an infrequent orthopedic procedure {{due to the}} requirement of special distraction devices and possible serious complications. Essential qualitative changes in operative technique development {{are associated with the}} name of G. A. Ilizarov, who {{paved the way for the}} autoregenerate gradual distraction method in the 1950 s. Material and Methods: In the years 1990 through 2006 a total of 57 patients underwent <b>femur</b> <b>lengthening</b> via gradual distraction using various types of external fixators at the Department of Pediatric Surgery, Orthopedics, and Traumatology, Faculty Hospital in Brno. The quality of bone healing was monitored and a number of parameters followed and statistically evaluated using regularly scheduled X-ray examinations. Results: In 11 cases we had to remove the external fixator following the distraction phase, perform an osteosynthesis via a splint and fill the distraction gap via spongioplasty. The bone healing was satisfactory in the remaining 46 patients and the lengthened bone required no other fixation method. The analysis showed statistically significant deceleration in bone healing following distraction in female patients over 12 years of age, and in boys over 14 years of age. Lack of periosteal callus five weeks after surgery always signified serious problems in further healing. Severe complications were recorded in 11 cases during the distraction phase, and in 9 cases after the removal of the distraction apparatus. Conclusions: The aim of this report was to present the results of our study of distraction gap bone healing using the gradual lengthening approach...|$|E
40|$|AIM: The {{effectiveness}} of the Ilizarov ring fixator in correcting achondroplasia’s lower limb deformities is known. However, whether the long term postoperative result is comparable to normal population standards, has not been analyzed. Materials and Methods: Nineteen (19) achondroplastic patients, 12 males and 7 females, aged 19 - 38 years, who {{at the age of}} 9 - 19 years, had undergone both tibia and <b>femur</b> <b>lengthening,</b> using the Ilizarov method, were included in the study. Patients were evaluated 5 - 19 years after their last surgery, using standardized long lower limb anteroposterior and lateral standing radiographs. Tibial and femoral lengthening gain was measured. A comparison between the achondroplastic patients at follow up and comparative radiographic parameters of the normal population was made, concerning– at the frontal plane- LPFA (lateral proximal femoral angle), LDFA (lateral distal femoral angle), MPTA (medial proximal tibial angle), LDTA (lateral distal tibial angle) and MAD (mechanical axis deviation) and – at the sagittal plane- PDFA (posterior distal femoral angle), PPTA (posterior proximal tibial angle) and ADTA (anterior distal tibial angle). Results: Mean angle values at follow up were: LPFA 118, LDFA 95. 5, MPTA 87. 8, LDTA 93, PDFA 85. 1, PPTA 84, ADTA 88. 3 while MAD mean value was 28. LPFA, LDFA, LDTA, PPTA, ADTA and MAD values were statistically significantly different (p< 0. 001) between achondroplastic patients and normal population. Conclusions: The use of the Ilizarov method for lower limb deformity correction, in achondroplastic patients, provides a functional length gain. It substantially corrects the three-dimensional deformities of the disease but, it does not restore the radiological image within normal standards.

30|$|Femoral {{lengthening}} can {{be combined}} with the tibial lengthening {{at the same time}} or at a separate time to treat concomitant shortening of the femur. Simultaneous <b>femur</b> and tibia <b>lengthening</b> with external fixation is used when the femur and tibia shortening is of significant magnitude. In such cases, it is not unusual to perform the SUPERankle procedure with application of the external fixator for <b>lengthening</b> tibia and <b>femur.</b> A discussion of femoral lengthening {{is beyond the scope of}} this article, but for further information the reader is referred to published studies [32, 33, 34]. If femoral lengthening is considered, it is factored into the surgical life plan discussed previously. Obviously, simultaneous femoral and tibial lengthening can yield much larger amounts of lengthening in one treatment than tibia lengthening alone. For example, simultaneous 5.0 -cm femoral and 5.0 -cm tibia lengthening together take a total of 5  months of external fixation, and isolated tibia lengthening of 5.0  cm also takes a total of 5  months of external fixation. Therefore, in the first example combined femoral and tibia lengthening achieve 10.0  cm (4 in.) of leg length equalization compared to only 5.0  cm (2 in.) when only the tibia is lengthened. While tibial lengthening alone requires daily physical therapy, combined <b>femur</b> and tibial <b>lengthening</b> mandates strict lengthening-specific physical therapy [33]. There is no indication to do femoral lengthening in the absence of femoral discrepancy. The advent of internal lengthening methods makes femoral lengthening as a separate procedure much easier.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study on physeal distraction {{was carried out}} in the distal femur of 45 two-month-old lambs for the purpose of identifying the basic mechanism of lengthening as well as assessing growth cartilage viability after lengthening. The animals were divided into three groups, each with three subgroups, according to the distraction rate employed (2 mm/day, 1 mm/day, 0. 5 mm/day) and the time at which the animals were killed (end of lengthening, 1. 5 months postlengthening, and at six months of age). Another group of three animals whose <b>femurs</b> were <b>lengthened</b> at a rate of 0. 5 mm/day was killed ten days postoperatively. Roentgenologic, specimen measurements, and histologic studies were performed on all animals. The results obtained showed that the basic mechanism for lengthening is the production of a physeal fracture between degenerative and calcified layers; this finding was consistent. It was also observed that the lower the rate of distraction employed, the greater was the short- and long-term viability of the growth cartilage. More specifically, optimal viability was observed when a distraction rate of 0. 5 mm/day was employed...|$|R
30|$|Femoral {{lengthening}} with {{or along}} intramedullary (IM) nails will occur along {{the axis of}} the nail coincident with the anatomical axis of the bone. In the <b>femur</b> particularly, such <b>lengthening</b> often creates lateral mechanical axis deviation as the knee is driven medially. In cases where shortening is associated with frontal plane deformity the surgeon needs to correct the deformity intra-operatively, however, subsequent lengthening along the anatomical axis will create deformity. Thus, planning for <b>lengthening</b> of the <b>femur</b> with or along IM nails, whether shortening is associated with frontal plane deformity or not, requires a completely different planning strategy. The author questioned if a resolution anatomical axis can be identified and used for planning when <b>lengthening</b> the <b>femur</b> along or with IM nails while still applying the same classic CORA deformity analysis method.|$|R
40|$|Background: The limb {{lengthening}} over plate {{eliminates the}} associated {{risk of infection}} with limb lengthening over intramedullary nail. We present our experience of limb lengthening in 15 patients with a plate fixed on the proximal segment, followed by corticotomy and application of external fixator. Materials and Methods: 15 patients (7 females, 8 males) were included in this consecutive series. The average age was 18. 1 years (range 8 - 35 years). Fifteen tibiae and one <b>femur</b> were <b>lengthened</b> in 15 patients. Lengthening was achieved at 1 mm/day followed by distal segment fixation {{with three or four}} screws on reaching the target length. Results: The preoperative target length was successfully achieved in all patients at a mean of 4. 1 cm (range 1. 8 - 6. 5 cm). The mean duration of external fixation was 75. 3 days (range 33 - 116 days) with the mean external fixation index at 19. 2 days/cm (range 10. 0 - 38. 3 days/cm). One patient suffered deep infection up to the plate, three patients had mild procurvatum deformities, and one patient developed mild tendo achilles contracture. Conclusion: Lengthening over a plate allows early removal of external fixator and eliminates the risk of creating deep intramedullary infection as with lengthening over nail. Lengthening over plate is also applicable to children with open physis...|$|R
40|$|A {{minimally}} invasive plate osteosynthesis technique using a locking compression plate (LCP) {{has been used}} widely in trauma cases. Its advantages are that the MIPO technique does {{not interfere with the}} fracture site and thus provides improved biological healing, and that the LCP has excellent angular stability. Its use in bone lengthening, however, has not been established. In such cases, it is desirable to shorten the external skeletal fixation period as much as possible. Here, the MIPO technique using an LCP was applied to femoral distraction osteogenesis in an attempt to shorten the external skeletal fixation period. For femoral lengthening, the MIPO technique was performed in 2 stages. Orthofix external fixators (Orthofix, England) were used to insert screws from the anterolateral side rather than from the lateral side of the <b>femur</b> for bone <b>lengthening.</b> When sufficient callus formation was detected postoperatively at the site of bone lengthening, and the absence of infection was ensured, limb draping was performed, including a whole external fixator, and then the MIPO technique was applied with an LCP. In 3 cases (5 limbs), the average duration of external skeletal fixation was 134 days, the average external-fixation index was 24 days/cm, and the average consolidation index was 22 days/cm. The MIPO technique using an LCP made it possible to shorten the external skeletal fixation-wearing period in femoral lengthening. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Stature {{lengthening}} in skeletal dysplasia is {{a contentious}} issue. Specific guidelines regarding {{the age and}} sequence of surgery, methods and extent of lengthening at each stage are not uniform around the world. Despite the need for multiple surgeries, with their attendant complications, parents demanding stature lengthening are not rare, due to the social bias and psychological effects experienced by these patients. This study describes the outcome and complications of extensive stature lengthening performed at our center. Materials and Methods: Eight achondroplasic and one hypochondroplasic patient underwent bilateral transverse lengthening for tibiae, humeri and femora. Tibia lengthening was carried out using a ring fixator and bifocal corticotomy, while a monolateral pediatric limb reconstruction system with unifocal corticotomy {{was used for the}} <b>femur</b> and humerus. <b>Lengthening</b> of each bone segment, height gain, healing index and complications were assessed. Subgroup analysis was carried out to assess the effect of age and bone segment on the healing index. Results: Nine patients aged five to 25 years (mean age 10. 2 years) underwent limb lengthening procedures for 18 tibiae, 10 femora and 8 humeri. Four patients underwent bilateral lengthening of all three segments. The mean length gain for the tibia, femur and humerus was 15. 4 cm (100. 7 %), 9. 9 cm (52. 8 %) and 9. 6 cm (77. 9 %), respectively. Healing index was 25. 7, 25. 6 and 20. 6 days/cm, respectively, for the tibia, femur and humerus. An average of 33. 3 % height gain was attained. Lengthening of both tibia and femur added to projected height achieved as the 3 rd percentile of standard height in three out of four patients. In all, 33 complications were encountered (0. 9 complications per segment). Healing index was not affected by age or bone segment.
