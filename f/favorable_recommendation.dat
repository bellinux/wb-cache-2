2500|$|Friedgen {{was born}} on April 4, 1947 in Harrison, New York. His father, [...] "Big Ralph" [...] Friedgen, {{attended}} Fordham University, where he played from 1938 to 1939, and coached high school football for 30years. The younger Friedgen worked under his father as a water boy and manager, and the two often attended New York Giants and Jets games together. He attended Harrison High School where he played quarterback on his father's team. John Nugent, the head coach of Harrison's rival Rye High School, recommended that his brother, Maryland head coach Tom Nugent, recruit Friedgen. His recruitment was handled by Lee Corso, then an assistant coach at the school. After his first season at Maryland, Nugent was fired as head coach, and his successor Lou Saban moved Friedgen to fullback to fill in for an injured teammate. The following year, Maryland had a new coach, and Bob Ward again changed Friedgen's position, this time to offensive guard, although he had never blocked before. Upset about the constant turnover at head coach and position changes, Friedgen received a <b>favorable</b> <b>recommendation</b> to transfer from coach Ward, but his father said, [...] "You can transfer, {{but when you get}} home, the key you have is not going to fit the door because we're changing the lock. Quitters don't live here." [...] He remained at Maryland as a guard and later said the experience taught him a lesson in perseverance. As an undergraduate, {{he was a member of}} Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. After completion of his bachelor's degree in physical education in 1970, Friedgen served as a graduate assistant at his alma mater, before later accepting positions on the staffs of The Citadel, William and Mary, and Murray State. Joining him on many of these coaching stops was Frank Beamer, who later served as head coach at Virginia Tech.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} recent regulatory and practitioner concerns that managers provide more (less) information to analysts with more (less) <b>favorable</b> stock <b>recommendations.</b> We examine the relative forecast accuracy of analysts {{before and after}} a recommendation issuance {{under the assumption that}} increases (decreases) in management-provided information will increase (decrease) analysts' relative forecast accuracy. We find that analysts issuing more <b>favorable</b> <b>recommendations</b> experience a greater increase in their relative forecast accuracy compared with analysts with less <b>favorable</b> <b>recommendations.</b> Additional tests on the change in frequency with which analysts issue forecasts independent of or in conjunction with other analysts after their recommendation change yield corroborating results. In addition, we find that the greater increase in relative accuracy for analysts with more <b>favorable</b> <b>recommendations</b> exists prior to the passage of Regulation FD but not after.

Second, using large trades to proxy for institutional trading, {{we find that the}}re are more buyer-initiated than seller-initiated large trades around <b>favorable</b> <b>recommendations</b> and vice versa for unfavorable recommendations. Lastly, we find that the change in institu- tional ownership that is explained by stock recommendations is associ- ated with positive abnormal returns in the future, about 4. 2 percent per year. Overall, these results indicate that institutional investors trade upon stock recommendations and that such trading contributes to their superior performance...|$|R

This study examines the pattern of recommendations on companies listed on the Korean Stock Exchange and the response of stock prices to the recommendations. There is evidence that brokerages affiliated with chaebols make overall less <b>favorable</b> <b>recommendations</b> than those unaffiliated with any chaebols. But a chaebol brokerage tends to make more <b>favorable</b> <b>recommendations</b> to firms affiliated with its own chaebol. I find that stock prices respond more to recommendations made by chaebol brokerages. In particular, the stock price of a firm affiliated with a chaebol tends to respond more to recommendations issued by the brokerage affiliated with the same chaebol. Market responses also depend on whether the recommendations are anticipated. Prices respond to unanticipated recommendations much stronger than they do to anticipated recommendations: stock prices rise more following unanticipated upgrade recommendations than they decline following unanticipated downgrade recommendations...|$|R

40|$|In this study, I {{propose a}} simple {{framework}} {{to examine the}} link between analysts’ target prices and their stock recommendations.

Both contingency table and regression analysis support the prediction that analysts issue more <b>favorable</b> <b>recommendations</b> to stocks with a higher difference between the ratio of target price to price and the benchmark return.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two distinct chapters. In the first chapter, I study the outsourc-ing of corporate governance to proxy advisory firms, which are third-party advisors that help institutional investors decide which way to vote on corporate governance issues. Advising equity assets in trillions of dollars, these advisors play a powerful role in shaping corporate governance. First, I model how conflicts of interest arise when a proxy advisor provides advisory services to investors as well as consulting services to corporations on the same governance issues. The advisor can issue biased voting recommendations when expected reputation costs are low, compared to consulting fees. I then study how increased competi-tion can alleviate these conflicts. Using a unique dataset on voting recommendations, I show that the entry of a new advisory firm reduces <b>favorable</b> <b>recommendations</b> for management proposals by the incumbent advisor. This is consistent with our theory as the incumbent is subject to conflicts of interest by serving both investors and corporations. These results inform the policy debate on whether and how to regulate the proxy advisory industry.

40|$|This article investigates {{whether the}} {{business}} relations between {{mutual funds and}} brokerage firms influence sell-side analyst recommendations. Using a unique data set that discloses brokerage firms’ commission income derived from each mutual fund client {{as well as the}} share holdings of these mutual funds, we find that an analyst’s recommendation on a stock relative to consensus is significantly higher if the stock is held by the mutual fund clients of the analyst’s brokerage firm. The optimism in analyst recommendations increases with the weight of the stock in a mutual fund client’s portfolio and the commission revenue generated from the mutual fund client. However, this <b>favorable</b> <b>recommendation</b> bias towards a client’s existing portfolio stocks is mitigated if the stock in question is highly visible to other mutual fund investors. Abnormal stock returns are significantly greater both for the announcement period and in the long run for favorable stock recommendations from analysts not subject to client pressure than for equally favorable recommendations from business-related analysts. In addition, we find that subsequent to announcements of bad news from the covered firms, analysts are significantly less likely to downgrade a stock held by client mutual funds. Mutual funds increase their holdings in a stock that receives a <b>favorable</b> <b>recommendation</b> but this impact is significantly reduced if the recommendatio...|$|E
40|$|The novel {{power factor}} {{correction}} system described here is an improvement over existing ones because it reduces the VAR`s with no switching transients, continuously; i. e., without the customary VAR-jumps that result from the usual capacitor-switchings. Work on this concept was begun in the early 1980 `s by Mr. Frederick Rohatyn. The invention was granted a U. S. Patent (No. 4, 672, 298) in June 1987. Mr. Rohatyn continued his experiments for four year`s following issuance of the patent. During that time, he built several prototypes {{in order to develop}} a practical realization of his idea.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether analyst {{recommendations}} are influenced by the strength of corporate governance in emerging markets. Design/methodology/approach – It is expected that analysts take into consideration the corporate governance mechanisms when they set their recommendations because better-governed companies are associated with less risk from management and have value improvement potentials. This hypothesis is tested with a sample of 805 firms in 26 countries from emerging markets. Corporate governance effectiveness is measured by the ratings compiled by Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia, which are based on a series of corporate governance characteristics. Findings – Results show that analysts tend to issue <b>favorable</b> <b>recommendations</b> for firms with better corporate governance mechanisms. Furthermore, this evidence is concentrated in countries with a code law origin where investor protection is relatively weak. Practical implications – This paper has important implications for financial analysts and investors by offering insights into how analysts help the market efficiently incorporate the quality of corporate governance in the code law countries of emerging markets. This paper is also of interest to companies by highlighting the significance of establishing good corporate governance mechanisms. Originality/value – Examining the association between analyst recommendations and the strength of corporate governance adds to the research on the association between corporate governance and analyst activity and therefore highlight the role analysts play in the valuation of corporate governance.
