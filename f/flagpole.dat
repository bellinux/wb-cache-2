Athens has never produced a major local label like many similar indie rock towns; the most important label of the 1970s and 1980s was DB Records, based out of Atlanta, though jangle pop pioneers Kindercore Records and Wuxtry Records were also Athens-based.|$|E

25|$|Up to four U.S. flags {{can be seen}} {{flying over}} the Capitol. Two <b>flagpoles</b> are located {{at the base of}} the dome on the East and West sides. These <b>flagpoles</b> have flown the flag day and night since World War I. The other two <b>flagpoles</b> are above the North (Senate) and South (House of Representatives) wings of the building, and fly only when the chamber below is in session. The flag above the House of Representatives is raised and lowered by House pages. The flag above the United States Senate is raised and lowered by Senate Doorkeepers. To raise the flag, Doorkeepers access the roof of the Capitol from the Senate Sergeant at Arms's office. Several {{auxiliary}} <b>flagpoles,</b> to the west of the dome and not visible from the ground, are used to meet congressional requests for flags flown over the Capitol. Constituents pay for U.S. flags flown over the Capitol to commemorate a variety of events such as the death of a veteran family member.|$|R
5|$|The law {{requires}} the lowering {{of the flag}} to {{the midpoint of the}} <b>flagpole</b> on the days of mourning or during mourning ceremonies.

When out in the open, the flag should always be flown between sunrise and sunset, irrespective of the weather conditions. Prior to 2009, the flag could be flown on a public building at night under special circumstances; currently, Indian citizens can fly the flag even at night, subject to the restriction that the flag should be hoisted on a tall <b>flagpole</b> and be well-illuminated.|$|E

5|$|Puerto Cabello {{continued}} {{to be controlled by}} Spanish forces after the fort's construction in 1766 until it was lost to Venezuela patriots on September 1, 1813. A surprise attack took place, aided by the forces of Rafael Urdaneta, {{in the midst of the}} Admirable Campaign in the Venezuelan War of Independence. The following day, Spanish commander Antonio Zuazola, who was known for having mutilated hundreds of prisoners in the east of the country, was imprisoned. Simón Bolívar, leader of the patriots, offered Domingo de Monteverde, leader of the royalists, the exchange of Zuazola with Domingo Jalón. After the proposal was rejected by the royalists, Bolívar ordered the death of Zuazola, who was hanged from a <b>flagpole</b> outside the walls of the fort.|$|E
5|$|Sir Jeffrey Wyatville, who was responsible, under King George IV, for the {{rebuilding}} of Windsor Castle, enlarged the house in 1828 at a proposed cost of £4000. Additions included an octagonal dining room in the north-east side, in which the King regularly had dinner. A three storey annex was added for the accommodation of the Bombardier, with a new wall linking a heightened turret to which a large <b>flagpole</b> was added. The addition of further Gothic details enhanced the interior and exterior of the fort in 1829. The fort is built of brick with an applied wash that imitated the appearance of stone.|$|E
5|$|The Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty 2007 {{comic book}} {{adaptation}} by Alex Garner retells Raiden's {{role in the}} series, with few changes made to the story. His relationship with Solidus is explored when he remembers his past; when about to be killed by Solidus, Raiden is saved by Snake. The game's novelization by Raymond Benson provides minor modifications to Raiden's history, except for the moment he receives Olga's sword, resulting in a change to his battle psyche. When Raiden kills Solidus he cuts the rope on Federal Hall National Memorial's <b>flagpole,</b> causing an American flag to fall over his enemy's body. This scene was deleted from the original game due to the September 11 attacks.|$|E

5|$|The Sultanate of Singora was {{a heavily}} {{fortified}} port city in southern Thailand and the precursor of the present-day town of Songkhla. It {{was founded in}} the early 17th-century by a Persian, Dato Mogol, and flourished {{during the reign of}} his son, Sultan Sulaiman Shah. In 1680, after decades of conflict, the city was destroyed and abandoned; remains include forts, city walls, a Dutch cemetery and the tomb of Sultan Sulaiman Shah.

5|$|The rules {{regarding}} the correct methods {{to display the}} flag state that when two flags are fully spread out horizontally on a wall behind a podium, their hoists should be towards each other with the saffron stripes uppermost. If the flag is displayed on a short <b>flagpole,</b> this should be mounted {{at an angle to}} the wall with the flag draped tastefully from it. If two national flags are displayed on crossed staffs, the hoists must be towards each other and the flags must be fully spread out. The flag should never be used as a cloth to cover tables, lecterns, podiums or buildings, or be draped from railings.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{suggested}} that McKinley's campaign {{of education of}} the voter through speakers and literature brought him victory, but with a cost to the close identification between voters and the political parties that was typical in the 19th century. Voter turnout was almost 80 percent in 1896, about average for presidential elections in the late 19th century, but then dropped substantially and remained at lower levels as voters, who once participated in rallies and torchlight processions for candidates, were distracted by radio and by professional sports. Nevertheless, later campaigns tried to recapture the magic of 1896; Warren G. Harding conducted his own front porch campaign in 1920, even borrowing the <b>flagpole</b> from McKinley's old front yard.|$|E
