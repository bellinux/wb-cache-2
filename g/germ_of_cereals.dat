50|$|The <b>germ</b> <b>of</b> a <b>cereal</b> is the {{reproductive}} part that germinates {{to grow into}} a plant; it is the embryo of the seed. Along with bran, germ is often a by-product of the milling that produces refined grain products. Cereal grains and their components, such as wheat germ oil, rice bran oil, and maize, {{may be used as}} a source from which vegetable oil is extracted, or used directly as a food ingredient. The germ is retained {{as an integral part of}} whole-grain foods. Non-whole grain methods of milling are intended to isolate the endosperm, which is ground into flour, with removal of both the husk (bran) and the <b>germ.</b> Removal <b>of</b> bran is aimed at producing a flour with a white rather than a brown color, and eliminating fiber, which reduces nutrition. The germ is rich in polyunsaturated fats (which have a tendency to oxidize and become rancid on storage) and so germ removal improves the storage qualities of flour.|$|R
40|$|At {{the time}} of its {{discovery}} two decades ago, vitamin E would have been defined as the fifth member of the then small family of vitamins. It was known to be widely distributed in green plants, in the <b>germ</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> grains, and, to a lesser extent, in animal tissues. It was known to be essential for normal reproduction in the laboratory rat. Although its ability to prevent fetal resorption in the female rat still constitutes the standard measure of its biological activity, a wide variety of seemingly unrelated changes have since been observed in the rat and in other laboratory animals as consequences of deprivation of the vitamin. Before discussing these lesions it may be appropriate to summarize briefly what we know concerning the nature and distribution of the vitamin. In 1936 Evans and his associates" 3 isolated from wheat-germ oil an alcohol having marked vitamin-E activity, for which the term alpha-tocopherol (tokos-offspring; pheros-to bear) was proposed. Within two years its chemical structure was determined and its laboratory synthesis accomplished. It is now recognized that three tocopherols (alpha, beta, and gamma), all of which are viscous oils, are the only substances in the plant world possessing vitamin-E activity. The isomeric forms, alpha and gamma, are lower homologues of alpha tocopherol. Biological assays of the natural, free forms of these tocopherols, in progress in my laboratory, indicate that alpha tocopherol is approximately twice as active as is beta tocopherol and four times as active as is the gamma form. Some 40 other compounds, produced synthetically, have been reported to show biological activity characteristic of the vitamin. None of these has proved as active as alpha tocopherol, the prototype of vitamin E. It is of interest to note that these tocopherols, while themselves susceptible to oxidation, also possess antioxygenic activity which is inversely proportional to their biological activity. The chemical nature of vitamin E and related compounds is extensively discussed in a recent review by Smith. 2...|$|R
30|$|The American Association <b>of</b> <b>Cereal</b> Chemists International (AACCI) {{definition}} of whole grain is {{applied in the}} present trial. According to the AACCI, whole grain includes cereal grains that consist of ground, cracker or intact grains, which incorporate all {{of the components of}} natural grain, including the endosperm, bran and <b>germ</b> (American Association <b>of</b> <b>Cereal</b> Chemists (AACC) International 2000). The components are present in the same relative proportions in whole grain cereals as they exist in the intact grain. For the purpose of the GReat-Child Trial, whole-grain foods are defined as foods made with at least one whole grain ingredient. All foods containing whole grain ingredients are included, regardless of the amount of whole grain they contained. The children who consumed a whole-grain food on {{at least one of the}} recall days are defined as whole grain consumers (Katcher et al. 2008). The amount of whole grain per 100  g in each of the whole-grain foods is estimated from the food label, or directly obtained from the food manufacturer. The whole grain values obtained per 100  g are then multiplied by the actual weight of the food consumed and divided by 100.|$|R
40|$|The <b>germ,</b> or embryo, <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> grains is {{the part}} of the berry from which the new plant develops. In wheat the germ is readily {{distinguished}} as the small wrinkled portion of the grain {{on the opposite side of}} the crease. It makes up about 1. 2 percent of the weight of wheat. Structurally, the scutellum is closely associated with the germ, both being separated from the endosperm by a layer of compressed cells, the hyaline layer. The scutellum and embryo together make up about 2. 7 percent of the weight of the wheat kernel (27). Bailey (7) reports 2. 23 percent in hard wheat. The embryo consists essentially of a plumule and a radicle portion, which become the leaves and roots respectively, of the new plant. Many analyses <b>of</b> wheat <b>germ</b> are to be found in the literature. Frequently, however, the source <b>of</b> the <b>germ</b> is not specified, nor is the degree of contamination with non-germ portions of the wheat indicated. Dissection of the wheat manually would be the ideal method of preparing samples, but this has not generally been undertaken, although Hinton has resorted to this method (27). Germ as produced by ordinary methods of milling contains a certain amount of the scutellum. It is always contaminated with some bran, although this may be reduced to a relatively low figure by careful screening and aspirating. [ [...] . ...|$|R
