5|$|With the {{internal}} weaknesses of fusionism now exposed, the Colorados moved to oust its supporters from the government.

5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a statute {{is an attempt}} by the {{legislature}} to prevent an act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of <b>intervention</b> <b>by</b> the courts at a later stage. One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause, which is inserted into a statute to indicate that the decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E
5|$|Another {{exception}} to the general rule that courts will generally only judicially review errors of law is where action is taken or a decision is {{made on the basis}} of no evidence, a lack of sufficient evidence, or an error of material fact. In such situations, <b>intervention</b> <b>by</b> the High Court is warranted as the action or decision is factually unsustainable.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of this, Birch has overdosed three times, and wrecked ten cars. Birch entered rehab in 2006, and missed six months of work. After his return, Birch became {{addicted}} to painkillers, due to the facial injury he suffered at the Armageddon pay-per-view in December 2006. After a direct <b>intervention</b> <b>by</b> WWE owner Vince McMahon, Birch was released, and credits this with him beating his addictions.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{a liberal}} agitation, pro-Greek and {{inspired}} {{by what was}} then happening in that country, began to develop in France. The longer France waited, the more delicate her position vis-à-vis Metternich became. The ultra-royalist government thus decided to accelerate events. A land expedition was proposed to Great Britain, which refused to intervene directly. Meanwhile, Russia had declared war against the Ottoman Empire and its military victories were unsettling for London, which {{did not wish to}} see the Tsarist empire extend too far south. Thus Great Britain did not oppose an <b>intervention</b> <b>by</b> France alone.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the local}} {{authority}} promised to build 1,000 new houses {{to accommodate the}} workforce {{by the end of}} 1938, but by February 1939 it had only awarded a contract for 100. Hives was incensed by this complacency and threatened to move the whole operation, but timely <b>intervention</b> <b>by</b> the Air Ministry improved the situation. In 1940 a strike took place when women replaced men on capstan lathes, the workers' union insisting this was a skilled labour job; however, the men returned to work after 10 days.|$|E

5|$|It {{is known}} from Byzantine sources that the Rus' caught Constantinople unprepared, while the empire was preoccupied by the ongoing Arab–Byzantine wars {{and unable to}} deal with the Rus' threat. After pillaging the suburbs of the Byzantine capital, the Rus' retreated, {{although}} the nature of this withdrawal, and indeed which side was victorious, is subject to debate. The event gave rise to a later Orthodox Christian tradition, which ascribed the deliverance of Constantinople to a miraculous <b>intervention</b> <b>by</b> the Theotokos.|$|E
5|$|On November 10, 1978, 10 {{months after}} being sworn in, White {{resigned}} {{his position on}} the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, saying that his annual salary of $9,600 was not enough to support his family. Within days, White requested that his resignation be withdrawn and he be reinstated, and Mayor Moscone initially agreed. However, further consideration—and <b>intervention</b> <b>by</b> other supervisors—convinced Moscone to appoint someone more in line with the growing ethnic diversity of White's district and the liberal leanings of the Board of Supervisors.|$|E
5|$|Scandinavian Scotland {{refers to}} the period from the 8th to the 15th centuries during which Vikings and Norse settlers, mainly Norwegians {{and to a lesser}} extent other Scandinavians, and their descendents colonised parts of what is now the {{periphery}} of modern Scotland. Viking influence in the area commenced in the late 8th century, and hostility between the Scandinavian Earls of Orkney and the emerging thalassocracy of the Kingdom of the Isles, the rulers of Ireland, Dál Riata and Alba, and <b>intervention</b> <b>by</b> the crown of Norway were recurring themes.|$|E

5|$|The Great Idea (Μεγάλη Ιδέα), {{the dream}} of uniting all Greek populations of the Ottoman Empire, thereby {{restoring}} the Byzantine Empire under Christian rule, led him to contemplate entering the Crimean War {{on the side of}} Russia against Turkey and its British and French allies in 1853; the enterprise was unsuccessful, and resulted in renewed <b>intervention</b> <b>by</b> the two Great Powers and a second blockade of Piraeus port, forcing Greece to neutrality.|$|E
5|$|The poor {{state of}} {{discipline}} of the Congolese forces became apparent again in 1990. Foreign military assistance to Zaire ceased {{following the end of}} the Cold War and Mobutu deliberately allowed the military's condition to deteriorate so that it did not threaten his hold on power. Protesting low wages and lack of pay, paratroopers began looting Kinshasa in September 1991 and were only stopped after <b>intervention</b> <b>by</b> French ('Operation Baumier') and Belgian ('Operation Blue Beam') forces.|$|E
5|$|Viking {{influence}} in the area commenced in the late 8th century, and whilst {{there is no doubt}} that the Uí Ímair dynasty played a prominent role in this early period, the records for the dates and details of the rulers are speculative until the mid-10th century.

5|$|After {{its season}} in London the company {{performed}} in Vienna, Budapest, Prague and Berlin. The tour was successful, artistically and financially, {{but was not}} without untoward incident. A planned visit to St Petersburg had to be cancelled because the Narodny Dom theatre burned down, and in Vienna the Philharmonic was unequal to the difficulties of the score of Petrushka. The illustrious orchestra revolted at the rehearsal for the first performance, refusing to play for Monteux; only an <b>intervention</b> <b>by</b> Diaghilev restored the rehearsal, {{by the end of}} which Monteux was applauded and Stravinsky given an ovation. In the middle of the tour Monteux was briefly summoned back to Paris by the Concerts Colonne, which had the contractual right to recall him, to deputise for Pierné; his own deputy, Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht, took temporary musical charge of the Ballets Russes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1860s, Levski {{developed}} a revolutionary theory that saw the Bulgarian liberation movement as an armed uprising of all Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire. The insurrection was to be prepared, controlled and coordinated internally by a central revolutionary organisation, which was to include local revolutionary committees in all parts of Bulgaria and operate independently from any foreign factors. Levski's theory resulted from the repeated failures to implement Rakovski's ideas effectively, {{such as the use of}} foreign-based armed detachments (чети, cheti) to provoke a general revolt. Levski's idea of an entirely independent revolution did not enjoy the approval of the entire population either—in fact, he was the only prominent Bulgarian revolutionary to advocate it. Instead, many regarded an <b>intervention</b> <b>by</b> the great powers as a more feasible solution.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Wang's {{only hope}} for rescue was an <b>intervention</b> <b>by</b> Dou Jiande, to whom he had sent envoys already in late 620. For Dou, the situation, as {{presented}} by his councillor Liu Bin, offered both danger and opportunity: if Luoyang fell, the Tang would next turn against Dou, but if Dou intervened and saved Luoyang, {{it would be easy}} to oust the weakened Wang and annex Henan to his own Xia state. It was therefore probably by design that Dou waited until April, when Wang's situation was critical, before he began marching west to relieve the siege of Luoyang. Dou's army was a huge force, reportedly over 100,000 strong, and the two earliest sources report 120,000 men. Although possibly exaggerated, an army of this size was well within the capabilities of the time. The Xia army was accompanied by a similarly large supply train, comprising both carts and boats.|$|E
