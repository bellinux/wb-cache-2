40|$|In {{synchronized}} root {{cells of}} Pisum sativum (cv. Alaska) the joining of nascent replicons is delayed until cells reach the S–G 2 boundary or early G 2 phase. To {{determine if the}} delayed ligation of nascent chains occurs at specific termination sites, we mapped the location of arrested forks in the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats from cells in late S and G 2 phases. Two-dimensional (neutral-alkaline) agarose electrophoresis and Southern blot hybridization with specific rDNA sequences show that only cells located at the S–G 2 boundary and early G 2 phase produce alkali-released rDNA fragments of discrete size. The released fragments are from a particular restriction fragment, demonstrating that the replication <b>forks</b> <b>stop</b> non-randomly within the rDNA repeats. Indirect end-labeling with probes homologous to {{one or the other}} end of the fork-containing restriction fragment shows that there are two termination regions, T 1 and T 2, where <b>forks</b> <b>stop.</b> T 1 is located in the non-transcribed spacer and T 2 is at the junction between the non-transcribed spacer and the 18 S gene. The two termini are separated by ˜ 1. 3 kb. Replication <b>forks</b> <b>stop</b> at identical sites in both the 8. 6 - and 9. 0 -kb rDNA repeat size classes indicating that these sites are sequence determined...|$|R

25|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, {{termination of}} replication usually occurs through {{the collision of}} the two replicative forks between two active replication origins. The location of the collision varies on the timing of origin firing. In this way, if a replication fork becomes stalled or collapses at a certain site, replication of the site can be rescued when a replisome traveling {{in the opposite direction}} completes copying the region. There are programmed replication fork barriers (RFBs) bound by RFB proteins in various locations, throughout the genome, which are able to terminate or pause replication <b>forks,</b> <b>stopping</b> progression of the replisome.|$|R
40|$|We used DNA microarrays of the Escherichia coli genome {{to trace}} the {{progression}} of chromosomal replication forks in synchronized cells. We found that both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (topo IV) promote replication fork progression. When both enzymes were inhibited, the replication <b>fork</b> <b>stopped</b> rapidly. The elongation rate with topo IV alone was 1 / 3 of normal. Genetic data confirmed and extended these results. Inactivation of gyrase alone caused a slow stop of replication. Topo IV activity was sufficient to prevent accumulation of (+) supercoils in plasmid DNA in vivo, suggesting that topo IV can promote replication by removing (+) supercoils {{in front of the}} chromosomal fork...|$|R

40|$|AbstractReplication of Saccharomyces ribosomal DNA (rDNA) {{proceeds}} bidirectionally from {{origins in}} {{a subset of}} the ∼ 150 tandem repeats, but the leftward-moving <b>fork</b> <b>stops</b> when it encounters the replication fork barrier (RFB). The Pif 1 p helicase and the highly related Rrm 3 p were rDNA associated in vivo. Both proteins affected rDNA replication but had opposing effects on fork progression. Pif 1 p helped maintain the RFB. Rrm 3 p appears to be the replicative helicase for rDNA as it acted catalytically to promote fork progression throughout the rDNA. Loss of Rrm 3 p increased rDNA breakage and accumulation of rDNA circles, whereas breakage and circles were less common in pif 1 cells. These data support a model in which replication fork pausing causes breakage and recombination in the rDNA...|$|R
50|$|Reptin is a {{component}} of both the INO80 and the TIP60/NuA4 protein complexes, which function in repairing DNA double-stranded breaks. Such breaks may lead to cancer and other issues. Researchers have found that reptin is highly important in several functions of both of these complexes. The INO80 complex {{has been shown to}} directly participate in both the homologous recombination and the non-homologous end joining processes for fixing double stranded breaks. In addition, it removes histones from the broken DNA to allow repair systems access. Human INO80 also activates genes that resume replication fork action when the replication <b>fork</b> <b>stops</b> at a double stranded break, and it is likely involved in the process directly as well. It has been shown that, in the absence of INO80, there are significantly more double stranded breaks during replication.|$|R

25|$|Termination {{requires}} that {{the progress of the}} DNA replication <b>fork</b> must <b>stop</b> or be blocked. Termination at a specific locus, when it occurs, involves the interaction between two components: (1) a termination site sequence in the DNA, and (2) a protein which binds to this sequence to physically stop DNA replication. In various bacterial species, this is named the DNA replication terminus site-binding protein, or Ter protein.|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} fiber {{autoradiography}} {{to examine the}} DNA product made in vitro in a lysed cell system. CHO cells were treated with 0. 01 % Brij- 58 and the lysates were incubated at 30 °C in a complete reaction mixture for in vitro DNA synthesis with [3 H) thymidine triphosphate ([3 H]TTP) as the radioactive tracer. Fiber autoradiograms prepared from the DNA showed that it was synthesized on tandemly arranged replication units that were of average size of 20 Jim, {{very similar to the}} size of units found in vivo. The rate of replication fork movement was 25 - 50 % of the in vivo rate. More than 80 % of <b>forks</b> <b>stopped</b> functioning by 15 min, and 95 % stopped by 60 min. This suggests that synthesis is halted by premature terminations. Evidence for new initiations was provided by replication units with labeled origins in DNA synthesized in an in vitro reaction in which radioactivity was omitted for the first 10 min of incubation. This, plus the observations that the distance between initiation points (replication unit size) is not increased and that premature termination accounts largely for the cessation of synthesis, suggest that significant initiation takes place in this in vitro replication system...|$|R

40|$|To {{study the}} {{structure}} of partially replicated plasmids, we cloned the Escherichia coli polar replication terminator TerE in its active orientation at different locations in the ColE 1 vector pBR 18. The resulting plasmids, pBR 18 -TerE@StyI and pBR 18 -TerE@EcoRI, were analyzed by neutral/neutral two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. Replication <b>forks</b> <b>stop</b> at the Ter-TUS complex, leading to the accumulation of specific replication intermediates with a mass 1. 26 times the mass of non-replicating plasmids for pBR 18 -TerE@StyI and 1. 57 times for pBR 18 -TerE@EcoRI. The number of knotted bubbles detected after digestion with ScaI and the number and electrophoretic mobility of undigested partially replicated topoisomers reflect the changes in plasmid topology that occur in DNA molecules replicated to different extents. Exposure to increasing concentrations of chloroquine or ethidium bromide revealed that partially replicated topoisomers (CCCRIs) do not sustain positive supercoiling as efficiently as their non-replicating counterparts. It was suggested that this occurs because in partially replicated plasmids a positive ΔLk is absorbed by regression of the replication fork. Indeed, we showed by electron microscopy that, {{at least in the}} presence of chloroquine, some of the CCCRIs of pBR 18 -Ter@StyI formed Holliday-like junction structures characteristic of reversed forks. However, not all the positive supercoiling was absorbed by fork reversal in the presence of high concentrations of ethidium bromid...|$|R

In aphidicolin-treated cells, the replication <b>fork</b> is <b>stopped</b> {{and there is no}} formation of DNA replication intermediates. However, 10 -kb DNA intermediates formed before the drug blockade are ligated to high molecular weight DNA whereas already formed Okazaki fragments accumulate in the cell. Moreover, in cells released from aphidicolin inhibition there is preferential labeling of 10 -kb DNA compared to Okazaki fragments. The 10 -kb DNA and the Okazaki fragments, therefore, respond differently to aphidicolin...|$|R

40|$|The DNA {{sequence}} {{limits of}} the leading and lagging strands in the arrested clockwise replication fork at the terminus of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome have been investigated. On the basis of hybridization to synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to known positions in the terminus region sequence {{it has been shown}} that neither the leading nor lagging strands, as they approach terC, traverse the distal inverted repeat, IRI. But a small fraction of the leading strands pass through the proximal inverted repeat, IRII. This is consistent with IRI being the functional inverted repeat in arresting the clockwise fork. But most of the <b>forks</b> appear to <b>stop</b> at least 100 nucleotides short of IRI, and at various positions extending over a distance of at least 100 nucleotides...|$|R
40|$|In E. coli, DNA {{replication}} termination {{occurs at}} Ter sites and is mediated by Tus. Two clusters of five Ter sites {{are located on}} each side of the terminus region and constrain replication forks in a polar manner. The polarity is due to the formation of the Tus–Ter-lock intermediate. Recently, it has been shown that DnaB helicase which unwinds DNA at the replication <b>fork</b> is preferentially <b>stopped</b> at the non-permissive face of a Tus–Ter complex without formation of the Tus–Ter-lock and that fork pausing efficiency is sequence dependent, raising two essential questions: Does the affinity of Tus for the different Ter sites correlate with fork pausing efficiency? Is formation of the Tus–Ter-lock the key factor in fork pausing? The combined use of surface plasmon resonance and GFP-Basta showed that Tus binds strongly to TerA–E and G, moderately to TerH–J and weakly to TerF. Out of these ten Ter sites only two, TerF and H, were not able to form significant Tus–Ter-locks. Finally, Tus's resistance to dissociation from Ter sites and the strength of the Tus–Ter-locks correlate with the differences in fork pausing efficiency observed for the different Ter sites by Duggin and Bell (2009) ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{first light}} on the 8th, Col. Demas T. Craw and Maj. Pierpont M. Hamilton went by jeep from an early beach landing, to Port Lyautey to consult the French {{commander}} (Col. Charles Petit). The emissaries were {{to give him a}} diplomatic letter in the hopes of preventing any hostilities from starting. They went ashore as the fire of coastal batteries and warships and strafing French airplanes began. French troops near the Kasbah directed them toward Port Lyautey, but as they neared the town under a flag of truce, a French machine gunner at a road <b>fork</b> outpost, <b>stopped</b> them with a burst of point-blank fire which killed Col. Craw. Major Hamilton was then conducted to the headquarters of Col. Petit, where his reception led to no conclusive reply. The pervading atmosphere at the French headquarters in Port Lyautey was one of sympathy toward the Allied cause and distaste for the current fighting. What was lacking was an authorization from Col. Petit's superior to stop fighting. Pending receipt of such authorization, the French at Port Lyautey continued to fight Units of the 60th Infantry Regiment began disembarking troops and supplies from their ships just off the Moroccan shore. The first wave of landing boats began circling and grouping together in preparation for the coming invasion. Unfortunately, in the confusion of disembarkation, the first wave was delayed as they looked for guidance to the shoreline; hence the second wave pressed into the shore as planned, on time. As the second wave began their attack, the first wave started in toward their objectives. Confusion was prevalent in the landing operation. Once the first wave made it to shore, the French defenders began resisting with small arms fire as well as cannon fire from a fortress (Kasbah [...] ) overlooking the area. For all of the first day, the 60th Regiment achieved their first objective of securing the beach, but had not secured their other objectives.The night of the 8th was stormy, men were trying to rest anywhere, and many scurried through the blackness to find their units.|$|R
