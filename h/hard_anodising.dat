5000|$|The {{most widely}} used {{anodizing}} specification in the US is a U.S. military spec, MIL-A-8625, which defines three types of aluminium anodising. Type I is chromic acid anodising, Type II is sulfuric acid anodising, and Type III is sulfuric acid <b>hard</b> <b>anodising.</b> Other anodizing specifications include more MIL-SPECs (e.g., MIL-A-63576), aerospace industry specs by organizations such as SAE, ASTM, and ISO (e.g., AMS 2469, AMS 2470, AMS 2471, AMS 2472, AMS 2482, ASTM B580, ASTM D3933, ISO 10074, and BS 5599), and corporation-specific specs (such as those of Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Airbus and other large contractors). AMS 2468 is obsolete. None of these specifications define a detailed process or chemistry, but rather a set of tests and quality assurance measures which the anodized product must meet. BS 1615 provides guidance {{in the selection of}} alloys for anodizing. For British defense work, a detailed chromic and sulfuric anodizing processes are described by DEF STAN 03-24/3 and DEF STAN 03-25/3 respectively.|$|E
40|$|<b>Hard</b> <b>anodising</b> is {{normally}} {{carried out with}} electrolytes at subzero temperatures and with a very high current density. This may sometimes lead to burning and powdered deposits. In this work, a method of <b>hard</b> <b>anodising</b> at a higher temperature (10 degrees C) using a pulsed power supply is investigated. The quality of coating obtained with this process is better than that obtained with the conventional method. Furthermore, it minimises the refrigeration requirements for cooling the electrolyte and eliminates the problem of burning and powdery coatings. The application of hard anodic coating with insulation resistance 1 - 30 G Omega up to 100 V dc to a pressure sensor as an insulating base layer is explored.

40|$|Aluminium and its alloys {{are widely}} used {{in a wide variety}} of applications. Aluminium’s main {{advantages}} include: lightness, high specific strength, high thermal and electrical conductivities, good formability, excellent machinability, diversity of aluminium alloys, extensive range of forming and processing options (e. g. rolling, extrusions, stampings, forgings and castings) and suitability for a diverse range of joining techniques, surface treatments and recyclability.

It refers to “welding or sticking ” of contacting bodies which shall open vertically (no sliding), i. e. acc. to ECSS “separable contact surfaces”. Starting from a reported failure on a spacecraft, test facilities were developed and a verification study was done to show relevance between the test results and the reported failure. In the following, a standardised test method was set-up, in order to compare different space relevant materials and coatings for their tendency to cold welding. Within several studies, common experience and numerical results were gained on space relevant combinations of materials and coatings. Based on this knowledge, recommendations for use of certain combinations will be drawn. Adhesion forces under fretting were found to exceed the loading forces.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. <b>Hard</b> <b>anodising</b> on aluminium and its alloys has been widely practised {{for many years in}} order to improve the resistance of the otherwise poor wear characteristics of aluminium. In recent years there has been an increasing interest in other treatments and coatings, on both aluminium and other base metals. The aim of this investigation is to explain the tribological performance and wear mechanism(s) of an uncoated aluminium alloy, four anodic coated alloys, and also an electroless nickel alloy. All of the coatings are produced on three different aluminium alloys. The thickness of the anodic films is 30 - 35 micron, as this thickness falls within the range commonly used by industry. In an endeavour to explain the role of coating thickness on wear life, electroless nickel alloy has been produced in a range of thicknesses of 10, 20 and 30 micron. To evaluate abrasive and adhesive wear, the samples were rubbed against a single point diamond and steel ball, respectively, in a reciprocating movement at room temperature and 65 - 75 % relative humidity, under a wide range of load and sliding distance. Some tests continued to run until a breakdown of the coatings occurred, whilst other tests were interrupted at intermediate stages. This enabled the initiation and propagation of failure mechanisms to be studied. Abrasive wear was performed under dry conditions, whereas, adhesive wear was evaluated under both dry and lubricated conditions. Wear of these coatings was proportional to the applied load and sliding distance, but there was no direct relationship between wear and hardness. The tribological performance of these coatings appears to be dictated by a) the composition of the substrate, b) the chemical and physical nature of the coatings and c) the test conditions. Under boundary lubricated conditions there was a considerable increase in the wear life of the coatings. A three dimensional surface texture is superior to a machined surface, in controlling contact conditions. There is an approximate linear relationship between coating thickness and wear life for electroless nickel alloys. These coatings predominantly fail by adhesion, plastic deformation and brittle fracture. A microscopic model for fracture of brittle materials, under both static and dynamic conditions for abrasive and adhesive wear correlates very well with the behaviour of these coatings. Analytical interpretation of adhesive wear was made by separately calculating the coefficient of wear "K" of the counterbodies. This information enables an improved understanding of the wear test itself {{to be added to the}} model of the wear mechanisms involved...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this work was to further develop the idea {{introduced}} by Muaddi et al (1981) which enables some of the disadvantages of earlier destructive adhesion test methods to be overcome. The test is non-destructive in nature but it does need to be calibrated against a destructive method. Adhesion is determined by measuring the effect of plating on internal friction. This is achieved by determining the damping of vibrations of a resonating specimen before and after plating. The level of adhesion was considered by the above authors to influence the degree of damping. In the major portion of the research work the electrodeposited metal was Watt's nickel, which is ductile in nature and is therefore suitable for peel adhesion testing. The base metals chosen were aluminium alloys S 1 C and HE 9 as it {{is relatively easy to}} produce varying levels of adhesion between the substrate and electrodeposited coating by choosing the appropriate process sequence. S 1 C alloy is the commercially pure aluminium and was used to produce good adhesion. HE 9 aluminium alloy is a more difficult to plate alloy and was chosen to produce poorer adhesion. The "Modal Testing" method used for studying vibrations was investigated as a possible means of evaluating adhesion but was not successful and so research was concentrated on the "Q" meter. The method based on the use of a "Q" meter involves the principle of exciting vibrations in a sample, interrupting the driving signal and counting the number of oscillations of the freely decaying vibrations between two known preselected amplitudes of oscillations. It was not possible to reconstruct a working instrument using Muaddi's thesis (1982) as it had either a serious error or the information was incomplete. Hence a modified "Q" meter had to be designed and constructed but it was then difficult to resonate non-magnetic materials, such as aluminium, therefore, a comparison before and after plating could not be made. A new "Q" meter was then developed based on an Impulse Technique. A regulated miniature hammer was used to excite the test piece at the fundamental mode instead of an electronic hammer and test pieces were supported at the two predetermined nodal points using nylon threads. This instrument developed was not very successful at detecting changes due to good and poor pretreatments given before plating, however, it was more sensitive to changes at the surface such as room temperature oxidation. Statistical analysis of test results from untreated aluminium alloys show that the instrument is not always consistent, the variation was even bigger when readings were taken on different days. Although aluminium is said to form protective oxides at room temperature there was evidence that the aluminium surface changes continuously due to film formation, growth and breakdown. Nickel plated and zinc alloy immersion coated samples also showed variation in Q with time. In order to prove that the variations in Q were mainly due to surface oxidation, aluminium samples were lacquered and anodised Such treatments enveloped the active surfaces reacting with the environment and the Q variation with time was almost eliminated especially after <b>hard</b> <b>anodising.</b> This instrument detected major differences between different untreated aluminium substrates. Also Q values decreased progressively as coating thicknesses were increased. This instrument was also able to detect changes in Q due to heat-treatment of aluminium alloys...|$|E
