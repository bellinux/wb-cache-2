Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) before dissolution showed presence of outer dense region and inner porous region for the prepared asymmetric membrane and the pore size increased after dissolution for both outer and inner layer. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) showed no incompatibility between the drug(s) and the excipients {{used in the}} study. The developed system was {{able to control the}} release of ATN and AMB by increasing the solubility through buffering agents of different strengths (0. 25 N to 1. 0 N).

40|$|SITI NURHAJA SARAH: THE USE OF ENGLISH-INDONESIAN CODE SWITCHING AND CODE MIXING: A QUALIITATIVE STUDY OF SOCIOLINGUISTICS AT 8 TH SEMESTER OF PBI-A OF IAIN SYEKH NURJATI CIREBON English as {{a global}} {{language}} has commonly demanded people to know it. They begin learning it {{so that they can}} survive as the global era runs. That the people of our country begin learning that foreign language, it reflects to the idea of bilingualism and multilingualism, such as the English students of PBI-A of IAIN Syekh Nurjati. Code switching and code mixing is the linguistic phenomena and conversational behavior that appear due to the fact of bilingualism and multilingualism among the people. Thus, in this research, the investigation aims to describe such kinds of conversational sociolinguistic phenomena, especially in studying the formulation of code mixing, the type of code switching and code mixing, and the reasons and motivations of PBI-A students switching and mixing he codes. Poplack (cited in Kim, 2006) states that code switching is the alternation of two languages within a single discourse, sentence or constituent. In addition, code mixing refers to all cases where lexical items and grammatical features from two languages appear in a sentence (Muysken, 2000). This research is a qualitative study {{in the form of a}} case study, in which the researcher only investigates a speech community of PBI-A. In this research, there are some steps in analyzing the problem of the research; coding, classifying and describing, which all data of formulation and of type of code switching and code mixing are performed in table. The research findings show that there are two ways of <b>formulation</b> <b>code</b> mixing like the two of three theories that Muysken describes the process of code mixing. The researcher also finds that the six theories of Hoffman (1991) in classifying code switching and code mixing really occur in the discourse of the respondents. In addition, there are many reasons and motivation why the respondents of PBI-A switch the English-Indonesian codes. After analyzing and discussing the study, it can be concluded that the phenomena of code switching and code mixing is a sociolinguistic conversational behavior in bilingual and multilingual sphere. The research also has implication that it can give a better understanding to the readers about such a conversational behavior of code switching and code mixing. The other implication of this research is to build the perspective of awareness in interacting and contacting to people. One cannot apply a same code, especially code switching and code mixing, to all people in all situations. However, ones have to realize the condition, situation as well as the interlocutors they talk to by choosing proper codes, in this specific investigation is the use of code switching and code mixing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Prescribing Information System (PIS) is the definitive data source for all prescribing relating to all medicines and their costs that have been prescribed and dispensed in the community in Scotland from 1993. The information is supplied by Practitioner Services Division (PSD) {{who is responsible for}} the processing and pricing of all prescriptions dispensed in Scotland. These data are augmented with information on prescriptions written in Scotland that were dispensed elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Prescriptions are dispensed by community pharmacies, dispensing doctors and a small number of specialist appliance suppliers. In general, GPs write the vast majority of these prescriptions, with the remainder written by other authorised prescribers such as nurses and dentists. Also included in the dataset are prescriptions written in hospitals that are dispensed in the community. Note that prescriptions dispensed within hospitals are not included. Data include CHI number, prescriber and dispenser details for community prescribing, costs and drug information. Data on practices (e. g. list size), organisational structures (e. g. practices within Community Health Partnerships (CHPs) and NHS Boards), prescribable items (e. g. manufacturer, <b>formulation</b> <b>code,</b> strength) are also included. Further information is available at the online ISD Data Dictionary which provides additional metadata. The information in the PIS warehouse is supplied by PSD and is sourced through an established centrally managed national payment system, which is updated on a regular basis. The data are provided for research purpose by the Information Services Division (ISD), who collects a wide range of health related administrative data on behalf of the NHS National Services Scotland (part of NHS Scotland) and has been the authoritative source of Scottish national health care statistics for over 50 years. The data are used to enhance decisions about Scottish health care to improve the health of the people of Scotland. ISD is part of the ScottisH Informatics Programme (SHIP), a Scotland wide research platform for the collation, management, dissemination and analysis of Electronic Patient Records. As part of SHIP, ISD delivers Electronic Data Research and Innovation Service (eDRIS), a one stop shop for health research designed to provide a single point of contact and to assist researchers in study design, approvals and data (non-patient or patient identifiable) access in a secure environment (the NSS National Safe Haven). The Prescribing Information System covers prescribing relating to all medicines and their costs that are prescribed and dispensed in the community in Scotland. A range of geographical and organisational measures are available in the dataset for patient residential address / prescriber / dispenser. These include&# 58; NHS Board Council Area Local Government District UK Parliamentary Constituency Scottish Parliamentary Constituency Electoral Ward Community Health Partnership Data Zone Census Output Areas Postcode Urban / Rural Codes Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation measures Carstairs Deprivation measures On April 1 st 2006 the configuration of NHS Boards was changed with NHS Argyll & Clyde being dissolved. The larger part of its area moved into NHS Greater Glasgow with the remainder moving to NHS Highland. Research Usage and Linkage Prescription drugs {{are one of the most}} common forms of treatment in the NHS and the majority of the population of Scotland are in receipt of prescription drugs at any point of time. Therefore the Prescribing Information System is a unique, complete and high quality source of information on prescribing in Scotland. As prescription expenditure covers in excess of £ 1 billion and around 15 % of the total NHS general revenue allocation in Scotland there is strong interest from the Scottish Government and NHS service providers for information to ensure the clinical and cost effectiveness of these treatments as well as policy development. Prescribing data are also in demand for medical research such as clinical trials and epidemiology. Prescription data are also used for target monitoring, national statistics publications, information requests (including Parliamentary Questions), health services research, performance management and providing information to support health promotion. The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) uses prescribing data on proportion of population being prescribed drugs for anxiety, depression and psychosis in the Health Domain. A number of commercial organisations use prescribing and dispensing data both in the form of published information on the website and information requests for bespoke tabulations and extractions. These include pharmaceutical companies and pharmacy contractors and drug wholesale suppliers. Pharmaceutical companies use the information to inform new drug development and the uptake, effectiveness and safety of drugs current in use. ISD produces a range of prescribing related publications. Prescribing indicators are available from the Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics website. Note that the availability of CHI data from April 2009 onwards means that it is possible to relate prescribing data to other ISD datasets holding the CHI variable. </div...|$|E

Wide adoptions are important as they help reduce manufacturer and end-user costs by allowing the use of materials across a wide user base, thus allowing economies of scale in production of materials used in construction. Uniformity in the codes adopted across many areas also allows a broader sharing of best building practices and techniques, and improves transferability of experts such as architects, engineers, code officials, building inspectors, and other building professionals among those different areas. More adoptions also invites broader participation in the <b>formulation</b> the <b>codes,</b> which lends to the incorporation of the latest and best building techniques that enhance the safety of citizens in the areas using the codes.|$|R

Methods: The suitability of the prepared formulations for buccal application was assessed by means of rheological studies, textural profile analysis, and ex vivo drug-release studies. Plastic flows, typical gel-like spectra, and suitable mechanical properties were obtained from prepared formulations. The retention time was explored in in vivo distribution studies and the effect of the gel containing CsA SLNs on the healing of oral mucosal ulceration was investigated in an animal model. In vivo distribution studies are a very important indicator of the retention time of formulations at the application site. Results: Distribution studies showed that 64. 76 % &plusmn; 8. 35 % of the <b>formulation</b> <b>coded</b> &quot;F 8 +SLN&quot; remained on the buccal mucosa 6 hours after application. For {{the second part of the}} in vivo experiments, 36 rabbits were separated into three groups: the first group was treated with the gel formulation without the active agent; the second group with the gel formulation containing CsA SLNs; and the third group, used as the control group, received no treatment. Wound healing was established by scoring of the rate of wound healing on Days 3, 6, 9, and 12. Histological observations were made on the same days as the scoring studies. The bioadhesive gel formulation that included CsA SLNs increased the rate of mucosal repair significantly. Conclusion: This study has shown that the bioadhesive gel formulation containing CsA SLNs reported here is a promising candidate for the topical treatment of recurrent aphthous stomatitis.

The developmental history of two- and three-dimensional NS codes is recalled; the <b>formulations</b> employed by <b>codes</b> of increasing complexity are outlined; and previous reviews are noted. Particular attention is given to Reynolds-averaged NS methods and their use in analyzing subsonic, transonic, and vortex-dominated flows. Typical numerical results are compared with experimental data in diagrams and graphs, and a number of outstanding problems are considered...|$|R
