25|$|Initially, after {{feeling that}} Penny {{was not for}} him, Leonard turned his {{attention}} to fellow scientist Leslie Winkle. The first time Leonard asks Leslie out, she rejects him, and his further relationships with her proved to be only short-lived casual sexual encounters that only happened to satisfy Leslie's libido.

25|$|SS Dufferin was {{a coastal}} {{steamship}} built by Joseph McGill of Shelburne, Nova Scotia on April 14, 1905.

Tom recovers from his illness, a steadier and better man for it, and Julia's husband, Mr Yates, proves to be a respectable husband. Henry Crawford refuses to marry Maria. Her shame gives her no other options, so her father sets <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a house with Aunt Norris (for the role she had played as an ineffectual guardian and role model), the both of them out of his sight.

25|$|Pamela George was a 28-year-old Ojibwe {{woman with}} two kids, {{providing}} {{for herself and}} her family as a sex worker. On April 18, 1995, she was murdered outside of Regina, by Alex Ternowetsky and Steven Kummerfield, two 20-year-old white men attending college. The men picked <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> their car, drove her to the outskirts of Regina where they forced her to perform oral sex, and proceeded to beat her for 45 minutes to one hour. George succumbed to these injuries and was found dead in a muddy ditch outside of Regina. Due to the severity of the beatings George's family chose to have a close-casket funeral. On January 31, 1997, both men were convicted of manslaughter and were sentenced to 6 {{and a half years in}} prison.|$|E
25|$|Dugas next {{traveled}} to New York {{and then to}} Portland, Oregon, where she took up residence at another well-known bordello at that time, Emma Wingard’s. During her residence there she met the woman who became her companion and accomplice for a short time, Fanny Lisle. Dugas and Lisle left Portland and, around 1889, journeyed to San Francisco. Lisle found work at Lillie Winter’s bordello in North Beach. Meantime, Dugas entered into a romantic liaison with a Guatemalan coffee dealer, frequenting the Palm Court, Poodle Dog, and Cliff House with him. He put <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> an apartment on Powell Street, and she and Lisle formulated a plan to rob him of his money. However, their plan went awry and they were arrested in 1890 and held in the San Francisco jail on charges of larceny. They managed {{to break out of}} jail and flee the country. In 1892, San Francisco Municipal Reports identified them as fugitives from justice.|$|E

25|$|The present Mrs Bland is {{the second}} Mrs Bland. Mr Bland said his wife was the sole living {{relative}} for her family inheritance but she cannot both be sole heir and have a sister. Mr Bland's first wife died in the Second World War; he remarried soon after, to another Canadian woman. The family of his first wife had cut off communication with their daughter so thoroughly {{they did not know}} she had died. Sixteen years later, the first wife was announced to be the heiress to an overseas fortune as the last-known living relative. When this news reached the Blands, they decided the second Mrs Bland must pose as the first Mrs Bland. They fool a British firm of solicitors that sought the heir. When Quentin Duguesclin, who knew the first wife and her family, looked <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> England, a plan was laid to murder him. The plan was simple, with additions like the clocks taken from an unpublished mystery story that Miss Martindale had read in manuscript.|$|E

When the king falls for Frenchy, Doris orders their frog servant, Bust Rod, to lock <b>her</b> <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> {{order to make sure}} that Frenchy is not harmed, Fausto tells Bust Rod to take Frenchy to Cell 63, where the king keeps his favorite concubines (as well as René).|$|E
500|$|Fraser McAlpine of the BBC was {{positive}} {{in his review}} of the song. McAlpine felt that [...] "Dinosaur" [...] was the album's best track, {{and went on to}} note that its conception was enough to [...] "drive rock-bores into a state of spluttering fury." [...] McAlpine's consensus on the song was that [...] "it is made of nothing but sugar and sass and additives, a song from a young girl to an older man who is attempting to pick <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a club. All she has to offer him is a scattergun spray of insults, and cutie-pie whistling. It’s childish and Parental Advisory Required at the same time, and is going to infuriate any adult within hearing range." ...|$|E

In May 1912, Michael went to Copenhagen for the funeral of his uncle King Frederick VIII of Denmark, where he fell ill with a stomach ulcer that was to trouble him for years afterwards. After a holiday in France, where he and Natalia were trailed by the Okhrana, Michael was transferred back to Saint Petersburg to command the Chevalier Gardes. He took Natalia to the capital with him and set <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> an apartment, but she was shunned by society and, within a few months, he had moved her to a villa in Gatchina.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} after the Cliveden weekend, Profumo {{contacted}} Keeler. The affair that ensued was brief; some commentators have suggested that it ended after a few weeks, while others believe that it continued, with decreasing fervour, until December 1961. [...] The relationship has been characterised by Keeler as an unromantic relationship without expectations, a [...] "screw of convenience", although she also states that Profumo hoped for a longer-term commitment and that he offered to set <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a flat. More than 20 years later, Profumo described Keeler in conversation with his son as someone who [...] "seem to like sexual intercourse", but who was [...] "completely uneducated", with no conversation beyond make-up, hair and gramophone records.|$|E
500|$|Ironically, the storyline of {{the film}} was replayed in real life. [...] One of the nonprofessional actresses, a blonde factory worker, had a torrid affair with a {{technician}} who was part {{of the film}} crew. [...] Although the man neglected to tell her that he was married with a child, he promised to send for her when he got back to Prague and set <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> an apartment in the capital city. After waiting {{for a long time to}} hear from him, and telling all her friends that she would shortly be summoned to her love nest, she packed up her belongings and traveled to Prague, only to be spurned in no uncertain terms. The consequence of this situation was grimmer than the denouement of the film; the girl was embarrassed to return home, became a prostitute, went to jail, attempted suicide and finally emigrated to Australia, where there was a shortage of women, especially among Czech emigres.|$|E
