5|$|Since the 1959 season, only 15 hurricanes {{are known}} to have reached Category5 intensity. There are no known Category5 storms {{occurring}} before 1959. It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> earlier storms reached Category5 over open waters, but they were never recognized because they never affected land and remained at sea.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{have shown}} that all divers are {{affected}} by nitrogen narcosis, though some experience lesser effects than others. Even though it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> divers can manage better than others because of learning {{to cope with the}} subjective impairment, the underlying behavioral effects remain. These effects are particularly dangerous because a diver may feel they are not experiencing narcosis, yet still be affected by it.|$|E
5|$|Only four known {{systems were}} {{observed}} during the 1953 season. This was below the average at that time, which was six. Furthermore, {{the season was}} well below the 1949-2006average of 13named storms and had the fewest number of storms in the hurricane database. Only two tropical cyclones reached hurricane status, compared to the modern-day average of seven. Furthermore, 1953 {{is also one of}} the few seasons without a major hurricane. This season was part of a decade-long absence of major hurricanes; from 1950–56, no major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale) were reported in the Eastern Pacific basin. However, it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> storms were missed due to the lack of satellite coverage in the region in addition to the lack of Hurricane Hunter data, which did not become available until the following year.|$|E

5|$|The English army {{consisted}} {{entirely of}} infantry. It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> {{of the higher}} class members of the army rode to battle, but when battle was joined they dismounted to fight on foot. The core of the army {{was made up of}} housecarls, full-time professional soldiers. Their armour consisted of a conical helmet, a mail hauberk, and a shield, which might be either kite-shaped or round. Most housecarls fought with the two-handed Danish battleaxe, but they could also carry a sword. The rest of the army was made up of levies from the fyrd, also infantry but more lightly armoured and not professionals. Most of the infantry would have formed part of the shield wall, in which all the men in the front ranks locked their shields together. Behind them would have been axemen and men with javelins as well as archers.|$|E
5|$|The electors of Cardinal Rolando, {{immediately}} after proclaiming him Pope, attempted to place upon him the purple mantle which symbolized {{the assumption of}} the papal office, but then the election entered the tumultuous stage. Cardinal Ottaviano Monticelli snatched the mantle from Alexander’s back and his armed bands burst into the basilica. Alexander III and his supporters fled to the citadel of St. Peter, {{which was in the}} hands of Cardinal Boso. In their absence, the few cardinals who remained in basilica elected Ottaviano of S. Cecilia to the papacy and enthroned him as Victor IV. The exact number of his electors is not known, but there are good reasons to believe that it amounted six, including Ottaviano himself, since only five cardinals signed the manifest in his favour in the following month. However, it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> additional cardinals participated in the election of Victor IV but very quickly joined the obedience Alexander III.|$|E
5|$|The subfamilies of Dromaeosauridae {{frequently}} {{shift in}} content based on new analysis, but typically consist {{of the following}} groups. A number of dromaeosaurids have not been assigned to any particular subfamily, often because they are too poorly preserved to be placed confidently in phylogenetic analysis (see section Phylogeny below), or because they are basal relative to the primary subdivisions of Dromaeosauridae (Mahakala, for example, is the most primitive known dromaeosaurid and falls outside any named sub-group). The most basal subfamily of dromaeosaurids is often {{found to be the}} Unenlagiinae. This enigmatic group is the most poorly supported subfamily of dromaeosaurids and it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> or all of its members belong outside of Dromaeosauridae. The larger, ground-dwelling members like Buitreraptor and Unenlagia show strong flight adaptations, although they were probably too large to 'take off'. One member of this group, Rahonavis, is very small, with well-developed wings that show evidence of quill knobs (the attachment points for flight feathers) and it is very likely that it could fly. The next most primitive clade of dromaeosaurids is the Microraptoria. This group includes many of the smallest dromaeosaurids, which show adaptations for living in trees. All known dromaeosaurid skin impressions hail from this group and all show an extensive covering of feathers and well-developed wings. Like the unenlagiines, some species may have been capable of active flight. The subfamily Velociraptorinae has traditionally included Velociraptor, Deinonychus, and Saurornitholestes, and while the discovery of Tsaagan lent support to this grouping, the inclusion of Saurornitholestes is still uncertain. The Dromaeosaurinae is usually found to consist of medium to giant-sized species, with generally box-shaped skulls (the other subfamilies generally have narrower snouts).|$|E

30|$|Despite these advantages, this two-week {{short-term}} {{time window}} has a limitation {{due to the}} small portion of geocoded tweets compared to the total tweets, giving it {{the potential to be}} noisy. It <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> cities would score higher than others due to random variation, or that many cities would have no visits at all. However, only 11 cities, and only 3 US cities, had no visits, with 31 cities having at least 25 visits and as many as 1, 300 (New York). We thus concluded that statistically significant correlations observed between this measure and our other indices would be sound indicators of real relationships.|$|R
