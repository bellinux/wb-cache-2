In a first step, we derive the incidence of social security on the bargaining process itself. In a second step, the macromodel is extended to include the budget constraint of the social security system. Both the <b>distributive</b> <b>effect</b> of wage bargaining and the existence of payroll taxes reinforce capital-labour substitution.

30|$|We {{believe that}} this set of {{estimates}} provides reliable evidence of the <b>distributive</b> <b>effect</b> of the program, since the intervention left no room for individual self-selection for the program. The upper tail of the outcome distribution presents {{the positive effect of}} land title on labor supply even though the coefficient is not statistically significant. The point estimates are very similar in magnitude to the ANCOVA estimates. Our results suggest that the QTE estimates of this intervention are heterogeneous and more concentrated around the median. Completely in line with the literature, the results suggest that property rights matter even more for the poor than for those with higher incomes.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, if adults see leisure as an {{inferior}} good, they would work more hours. In this case, the wealth effect {{would not be}} large enough to cover extra expenses. Note that the <b>distributive</b> <b>effect</b> of the policy can be easily rationalized in this case as well. Given that the poor live in relatively cheaper houses, the wealth effect would be lower for them than for the better off. Because leisure is a good that is less affordable for the poor than for better-off households, poorer adults would respond to the intervention by working more hours than those who are better off. Based on available evidence, we would expect an increase in the adult labor supply.|$|R
5000|$|His {{best known}} {{contribution}} to constructivism is {{set out in}} World of Our Making (University of South Carolina Press, 1989). His approach {{is based on a}} continuum of performative language, rules and rule. Three types of speech act (instructive, hierarchichal, commissive) yield corresponding types of rule that, in turn, yield three types of rule (hegemony, hierarchy, heteronomy). Compliance with rules helps sustain rule, but failure to abide by them erodes rule. Rule, generally through institutionalized means, has <b>distributive</b> <b>effects</b> in political society (domestic or international), granting privileged access to material and symbolic resources to some agents over others. [...] One novelty of this approach is to go beyond the 'anarchy problematique' in IR (Richard Ashley's term). Instead of different types of anarchy (as in Alexander Wendt's Hobbesian, Lockean, and Kantian anarchichal settings), Onuf presents hegemony, hierarchy, and heteronomy as different structures of domination in world affairs (i.e. the absence of world government does not necessarily imply anarchy). These structures are respectively enabled by the repetition over time of behavior consistent with instructive, hierarchichal, and commissive rules by agents.|$|E

However, the Russian-Georgian war in 2008 destroyed the increasingly undermined FDIoriented liberal development model and forced the government to alter its economic policy. By relying on established informal instruments of intervention and the development of an official economic development agenda, a specific form of state-managed capitalism evolved in Georgia in the period that followed...|$|R
30|$|The main {{implication}} of our empirical analysis {{is that the}} Brazilian land titling program had {{a positive effect on}} hours worked and labor supply among adults. While the ANCOVA and DD estimates point to the positive effects of land titling on the average number of weekly hours worked, the QTE method points to a <b>distributive</b> <b>effect</b> of the intervention, mainly at the median of the unconditional distribution of outcome variables. However, the estimates for the extensive margin of labor supply strongly suggest that the effect on hours worked is driven by the increase in participation rate since the coefficients for the ATT and QTE become small statistically insignificant once we condition the distribution on those already in the labor force at the baseline.|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{approaches}} to cost benefit analysis, derived from social welfare maximization, {{suggest that it}} should ideally be adjusted to account for distributional effects. These approaches do not consider how tasks should be assigned within a large institution that includes specialized units such as the numerous agencies in the federal government. This paper considers how optimal distributive systems map onto the assignment of tasks to government agencies in such a system. It concludes that regulatory agencies should not, in general be asked to consider the <b>distributive</b> <b>effects</b> of regulations. The types of distributive adjustments that specialized regulatory agencies {{are able to make}} are not consistent with the types of distributive polices that are desirable. As a result, attempts to adjust cost-benefit analysis for <b>distributive</b> <b>effects</b> will likely be more expensive and less effective than other means of improving the distribution of resources.

Climate change mitigation policies to reduce carbon emissions from the energy sector by way of measures such as introducing a carbon tax have been widely known to be regressive i. e., the burden is borne more by lower income rather than higher income households, thereby making income distribution less equitable or fair.

It discusses the role and effectiveness of redistributive fiscal policies and quantifies the effects of taxation and government expenditure on income distributions. Panel estimation for 150 countries with data between 1970 and 2009 confirms international empirical findings for Asia. Tax systems tend to be progressive but government expenditures are a more effective tool for redistributing income. Moreover, the results suggest some distinctive differential <b>distributive</b> <b>effect</b> for government expenditure on social protection in Asia. Social protection spending appears to increase income inequality, whereas it reduces it {{in the rest of}} the world. Also, adversely affecting the distribution of income in Asia is government expenditure on housing. Some options for improving the effectiveness of fiscal policies in Asia are discussed.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{estimates}} {{the degree of}} altruism among spouses by examining how often the driver of a car sacrifices {{his or her own}} self in a car crash in order to save a spouse. Holding constant the magnitude of a collision, a driver can maneuver the car to distribute the risk from collision between the driver and a passenger. We quantify spousal altruism by the degree to which drivers riding with their spouse redistribute the risk from a fatal accident to themselves – as measured by ex post mortality – as compared to drivers not traveling with their spouse. We find that drivers with their spouses are roughly 1. 21 times more likely to sacrifice themselves. Assuming a $ 10 million value of life, this implies a willingness to accept a $ 2, 100, 000 loss to avoid the death of a spouse. A driver faced with a possible collision will take evasive maneuvers. These evasive maneuvers have two effects: an allocative effect that reduces the magnitude of an impact for both occupants and a <b>distributive</b> <b>effect</b> that divides the remaining impact between the driver and passenger. If one could hold constant the allocative effect of the impact, then the <b>distributive</b> <b>effect</b> – {{to the extent that it}} can be manipulated by the driver – would reveal how the driver felt about the passenger. Conventional wisdom predicts that the driver riding with his spouse – due to his love for her – is more likely to sacrifice himself for the passenger. This paper uses revealed preferences to quantify how much people favor their spouses over others. We compare the distribution of mortality between driver and passenger when the driver is riding with his 2 spouse to the distribution of mortality between driver and passenger when the driver is riding without her to estimate the level of the driver’s altruistic preference for his spouse...|$|R

After some evolutions, the results show that all households benefit from a slight water bill reduction, and the bill is identical for the 3 housing types for the same consumption. This slight reduction leads to hypothesize that the new tariff might not be justified. A detailed analysis raises several critical observations going against a simplistic vision of progressive tariffs. But the tariff also results in large increases for large consumers, some of whom consider exiting the service and drilling their own well… This type of analysis should be done before any tariff change, given the complexity of factors involved in water bills...|$|R

40|$|Mandatory pension systems {{occupy a}} central role in the system of social {{security}} because of the share of social expenditure in national economies. One of the goals of pension system is to redistribute incomes among individuals. However, it is not clear how the intentions to redistribute incomes coincide with the outcomes. In this paper, we will study the difference between the intentions as they are articulated within institutions, with the outcomes that are generated by them. We use the method of comparative institutional analysis in order to find out the differences. Our comparative institutional analysis is based on the grammar of institutions that is proposed by Crawford and Ostrom. Also, in order to understand the differences, we will compare the institutions in relatively similar cases – the Baltic States. The results show that there is a gap between the intentions and outcomes to redistribute incomes among individuals.

This study found that children in female-headed families lost economic ground to children in married-couple families both at the pre-transfer and post-transfer income stages over the years under this investigation, but the greatest loss appeared at the post-transfer income distribution.

40|$|Welfare state regimes vary {{in their}} {{redistribution}} strategies. Some welfare states have extensive taxable social insurance schemes, while others rely more on non-taxable means-tested benefits.

However, a study of net social insurance raises estimation problems in countries where spouses are taxed separately and income data only is reported on household level. The paper therefore includes a series of validity tests of estimated levels of social insurance after taxes. The main conclusion is that it is possible and necessary to estimate social transfers net of taxes in order to not misspecify the redistributive outcome of social insurance in both inter-country and intra-country analyses of income distributions.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to offer an {{overview}} of the many opportunities the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) data set provides to measure the <b>distributive</b> <b>effect</b> of taxes and transfers in the developed countries. Two specific tasks are undertaken. First, and most important, the paper offers a detailed discussion of a number of aspects of fiscal redistribution, presenting a good deal of newly computed data that are, to our knowledge, unavailable elsewhere. LIS data are detailed enough to allow us not only to measure overall redistribution, but also to explore whether redistribution has been achieved primarily through taxes or transfers; to compare the redistributive effect of the most important individual transfers; to determine whether redistribution is associated with the size or the internal target efficiency of social benefits; to focus separately on redistribution across all income groups, lower, middle and upper income groups, and those in poverty; and to examine separately households headed by persons of working age. Second, the paper places fiscal redistribution in a broader context by discussing several aspects of redistribution that are not directly measured in LIS surveys. These include the redistributive effect of in-kind benefits, which we will explore using an imputation method; and second-order effects, whereby direct transfers affect pregovernment private sector income, in turn affecting measures of direct state transfers...|$|R
