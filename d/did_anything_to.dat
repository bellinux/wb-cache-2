25|$|Astonished and saddened {{about being}} {{forced out of}} GMHC, Kramer took an {{extended}} trip to Europe. While visiting Dachau concentration camp he learned that it had opened as early as 1933 and neither Germans nor other nations <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> stop it. He became inspired to chronicle the same reaction from the American government and the gay community to the AIDS crisis by writing The Normal Heart, despite having promised never to write for the theater again.|$|E
25|$|At the Tour of Britain, {{the final}} major event before the 2011 UCI Road World Championships, Cavendish {{made his first}} {{appearance}} at his 'home' race since 2007. It {{was part of his}} plan to be at peak form before worlds. He was immediately successful. He and leadout man Renshaw were so convincingly the best in the stage 1 sprint that the leadout man finished in second place right behind his sprinter, much like they had in the Champs-Élysées stage at the 2009 Tour de France. Their positions were reversed in the stage 5 sprint, as Renshaw took victory ahead of Cavendish. It was unclear whether Cavendish intentionally gifted the stage to his longtime leadout man, though Renshaw acknowledged afterward that Cavendish was definitely not giving a full effort. The news on the day for the tam was not all good, as Rasmussen was pulled from the event and had his contract terminated due to news that he had missed three doping controls. Rasmussen was later exonerated due to a procedural error {{on the part of the}} UCI. Undeterred, Cavendish closed out the Tour of Britain by winning the very short road race stage into London on its final day. Renshaw, again, took second place, perhaps proving himself the better of each other team's primary sprinter. In October, as the team's time together was winding down, Martin debuted his newly-won world championship rainbow jersey in the stage 1 time trial at the inaugural Tour of Beijing. None of the race's subsequent stages <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> dislodge the German from the top of the overall standings, making him the first overall winner of the new event.|$|E
2500|$|On July 19, 2013, in Riverside Superior Court, Miller {{was sentenced}} to death. On August 16, 2013 Cox and John were sentenced. Cox {{was sentenced to}} two life terms without parole. Cox showed no remorse stating, [...] "I {{apologize}} {{for what happened to}} the victims' family. I didn't say I'm sorry I did anything because I still don't feel that I <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> be here for it." [...] He also said he would appeal. John, the gunman, was given the death penalty. Judge Christian Theirbach called the murders savage, and the most inhuman he had seen in his 27 years on the bench.|$|E

Although {{he claimed to}} be innocent of the charges, he pleaded guilty in 1996 to conspiring to kill four horses for their insurance payouts between 1987 and 1990: Charisma, Condino, Rub the Lamp and Roseau Platiere. In court papers he [...] "admitted that he told the horse killer to keep quiet {{about the people who}} hired the killer to slaughter the horses, and, if he kept quiet about [...] friends and business associates, [...] would pay him money.

[...] After a group of Iraqi ministers backed the Iraqi Interior Ministry's decision to shut down Blackwater USA's operations in Iraq, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki called on the U.S. government to end its contract with Blackwater and called on Blackwater to pay the families $8 million in compensation.|$|E
