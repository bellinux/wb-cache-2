5|$|The New Jersey and Illinois {{versions}} {{were also}} built on {{what used to}} be sections of parking lot. Georgia's version was built on <b>hilly</b> <b>terrain,</b> and hence there is a short tunnel when the track enters the 270 degree helix leading into the heartline roll.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} inhabits areas with significant cover from grasses or heavy undergrowth, {{and close to}} water bodies. It generally keeps away from human-inhabited areas. Though they are habitat generalists, {{four-horned antelope}}s mostly occur in open, dry, deciduous forests in <b>hilly</b> <b>terrain.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong Island's steep, <b>hilly</b> <b>terrain</b> was {{initially}} served by sedan chairs. The Peak Tram, {{the first public}} transport system in Hong Kong, has provided vertical rail transport between Central and Victoria Peak since 1888. In Central and Western district, there is an extensive system of escalators and moving pavements, including the longest outdoor covered escalator system in the world, the Mid-Levels escalator.|$|E

50|$|Toppesfield is {{situated}} in north Essex, which has considerably <b>hillier</b> <b>terrain</b> than most other areas of Essex. It {{is situated}} close (8 miles) to the Suffolk borders.|$|R
5|$|Because of the <b>hilly</b> <b>terrain,</b> {{the station}} was built in a deep cutting {{excavated}} from Highgate Hill adjacent to Archway Road. Tunnels penetrated the hillside {{at each end of}} the station, leading towards East Finchley to the north and Crouch End to the south. When built, the station had two side platforms, with three tracks between them, and a station building on the south side. A footbridge linked the two platforms.|$|E
5|$|The Hastings line {{is built}} over the difficult, forested, and <b>hilly</b> <b>terrain</b> across the High Weald and {{sandstone}} Hastings Beds, necessitating the construction of eight tunnels between Tonbridge and the south coast seaside resort of Hastings. The SER was anxious to construct the line as economically as possible, since it was in competition with the LBSC to obtain entry into Hastings and {{was not in a}} strong financial position in the mid 1840s.|$|E
5|$|The Usumacinta style {{developed}} in the <b>hilly</b> <b>terrain</b> of the Usumacinta drainage. Cities {{took advantage of the}} hillsides to support their major architecture, as at Palenque and Yaxchilan. Sites modified corbel vaulting to allow thinner walls and multiple access doors to temples. As in Pet√©n, roof combs adorned principal structures. Palaces had multiple entrances that used post-and-lintel entrances rather than corbel vaulting. Many sites erected stelae, but Palenque instead developed finely sculpted panelling to decorate its buildings.|$|E

5|$|Today, {{the breed}} is used mainly for meat, {{due to its}} {{extensive}} musculature. Horse meat is a dietary staple in many European countries, including France, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland. However, they are increasingly used for farm, forest and leisure work. Their nimble action, stamina and good temper make them increasingly used for competitive driving across Europe, and they have also been used as mounts for therapeutic horseback riding. The breed {{is known for its}} ability to work in rough, <b>hilly</b> <b>terrain.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{would be}} {{expected}} for a road crossing the Pennines, Snake Pass has several dangerous bends and blind summits. Like many roads in the North of England passing through similar terrain, Snake Pass has a poor safety record in comparison to other roads in the United Kingdom {{but it is not}} as dangerous as other roads bisecting <b>hilly</b> <b>terrain</b> in this part of England. It was not among the top 10 in a list of the most dangerous roads published in July 2010, despite nine of the top ten being in Northern England.|$|E
5|$|Between Randville and {{the former}} {{community}} of Metropolitan, M-69 runs along the West Branch of the Sturgeon River through more <b>hilly</b> <b>terrain.</b> The trunkline continues east to the twin communities of Theodore and Felch. The river and the road part ways until meeting again at Foster City. This is also {{the location of a}} unique junction of highways. M-69 meets G-69, a County-Designated Highway that runs south to Loretto in southern Dickinson County. The intersection in unique because some states, such as California, do not allow two highways to share a common number.|$|E
50|$|The terrain {{generally}} {{ranges from}} 345 to 399 m {{above sea level}} with rugged mountain areas. Coastal areas deviate from plain to <b>hilly</b> <b>terrains.</b> Rivers, streams and springs abound throughout the municipality, but the most prominent is the Talolong River.|$|R

5|$|Fleetwood {{continued}} to grow without its principal investor, albeit slowly. As a port, it soon faced competition from Lytham and Preston. In 1847 Queen Victoria and Prince Albert travelled through Fleetwood {{on their way to}} London from Scotland, but that year saw the decline of the town's importance on the route to Scotland. More powerful locomotives were now able to travel over <b>hilly</b> <b>terrain,</b> and the railway was extended over Shap Fell all the way to Scotland; Fleetwood was no longer needed as a sea link.|$|E
5|$|Often {{compared}} to San Francisco {{due to the}} <b>hilly</b> <b>terrain</b> and steep maze of residential streets, housing in St. John's is typically painted in bright colours. The city council has implemented strict heritage regulations in the downtown area, including restrictions on the height of buildings. These regulations have caused much controversy over the years. With the city experiencing an economic boom a lack of hotel rooms and office space has seen proposals put forward that {{do not meet the}} current height regulations. Heritage advocates argue the current regulations should be enforced while others believe the regulations should be relaxed to encourage economic development.|$|E
5|$|Since Raja Sahil Varman, the dynasty ruled without {{successful}} invasion {{for around}} a millennium, until the British gained power. The {{isolation of the}} town and its rugged <b>hilly</b> <b>terrain</b> {{is believed to have been}} a contributing factor to this unusual state of security. Later, Mughal emperors Akbar and Aurangzeb did attempt to annex Chamba but were unsuccessful in subjugating this territory into their kingdoms. Raja Prithvi Singh (1641-1664 AD), who was on amiable terms with Emperor Shahjahan was instrumental in introducing the court lifestyles of the Mughals.|$|E
50|$|The west {{part of the}} {{province}} is the low river plain of the Bang Pa Kong River, which is used extensively for farming rice. To the east is <b>hillier</b> <b>terrain,</b> with an average height of more than 100 m above sea level.|$|R

5|$|The city {{generally}} slopes {{from the}} highest point in the Northeast to the lowest point in the Southwest towards the Missouri River. Prominent tributaries of the river are Perche Creek, Hinkson Creek, and Flat Branch Creek. Along these and other creeks in the area can be found large valleys, cliffs, and cave systems such as that in Rock Bridge State Park {{just south of the}} city. These creeks are largely responsible for numerous stream valleys giving Columbia <b>hilly</b> <b>terrain</b> similar to the Ozarks while also having prairie flatland typical of northern Missouri. Columbia also operates several greenbelts with trails and parks throughout town.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{asserts that}} all wild trees grow from seed or from roots. He {{mentions}} that the philosophers spoke of spontaneous generation, as when Anaxagoras claims the air contains {{the seeds of}} every plant, whereas Diogenes believed plants arose when water mixed with earth. In places like Crete, Theophrastus writes that native plants spring up if the ground is simply disturbed, and that wild trees are generally more vigorous than cultivated ones, give fruit later, and like cold and <b>hilly</b> <b>terrain.</b> He asserts that trees which can grow both on hill and plain grow better and taller when grown on the plain.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, Secretary of War Henry Dearborn {{appointed}} Scott and Governor James Garrard {{to evaluate}} sites in Kentucky {{on which to}} construct a replacement for Fort Washington. Garrard, a central Kentucky native, insisted that the fort should be built at Frankfort. Scott disagreed, contending that the fort {{should not be in}} the state's interior and that the <b>hilly</b> <b>terrain</b> around Frankfort was unsuitable for constructing a fort. He waited several days for an appointment with Garrard to try and reach an agreement, but when he was unable to secure one, he asked Dearborn for permission to act alone. Dearborn granted the request and accepted Scott's recommendation of a site in Newport, Kentucky. In 1804, Scott was again chosen a presidential elector with minimal opposition.|$|E

5|$|In Baraga and Marquette counties, US41/M-28 {{passes through}} <b>hilly</b> <b>terrain</b> before {{entering}} the urban areas of Ishpeming, Negaunee and Marquette. Approximately 13,000‚Äì17,000vehicles use this section from Ishpeming eastward through Negaunee. West {{of the city of}} Marquette, US41/M-28 had a peak 2013 AADT of 32,805vehicles in Marquette Township along a retail and business corridor. This peak level is sustained until the start of the Marquette Bypass, where the traffic returns to the 16,500-vehicle and higher levels seen in Ishpeming and Negaunee. South of the city of Marquette, traffic counts once again climb to 19,620vehicles. In Chocolay Township the AADT drops to 8,840vehicles before tapering off to 3,065vehicles by the county line.|$|E
5|$|M-26 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with US45 east of Rockland in Michigan's Ontonagon County. From there it {{runs through the}} town of Mass City to the junction with M-38 east of Greenland. The two highways join for a short distance before M-26 separates turning northeast to Winona across the Houghton County line. In Twin Lakes M-26 passes {{the shores of the}} namesake lakes and Twin Lakes State Park. M-26 passes through wooded, <b>hilly</b> <b>terrain</b> in western Houghton County. The segment of roadway in South Range was recently realigned to smooth out curves in the roadway. From there north, M-26 runs generally downhill on approaching the western business district of Houghton and the Portage Lake Lift Bridge from the west.|$|E
5|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the phalanx {{was that it}} was only effective when fighting in large, open spaces, which left the Romans at a disadvantage when fighting in the <b>hilly</b> <b>terrain</b> of the central Italian peninsula. In the 4th century BC, the Romans abandoned the phalanx in favour of the more flexible manipular formation. This change is sometimes attributed to Marcus Furius Camillus and placed shortly after the Gallic invasion of 390 BC; it is more likely, however, that they were copied from Rome's Samnite enemies to the south, possibly as a result of Samnite victories during the Second Samnite War (326 to 304 BC).|$|E
