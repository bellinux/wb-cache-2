5|$|But reform {{brought with}} it new ways of {{thinking}} about the church and its personnel, derived not only from contemporary continental movements but also from the rich pastoral and canonical literature of the Carolingian renaissance. This disseminated ideas concerning the separation of the lay and religious spheres, the distinction between monks and clergy, and <b>enhanced</b> <b>the</b> authority of bishops as both pastoral and political leaders. Ultimately, these ideas were to strike at deeply entrenched features of the early medieval church, such as hereditary control of churches and the right of the clergy to marry.|$|E

The Catholicosate of Aghtamar and the locally influential Syunik bishops <b>enhanced</b> <b>the</b> importance of the region around Etchmiadzin. In 1441 a general council of several hundred religious figures met in Etchmiadzin and voted to reestablish a catholicosate there. The cathedral was restored by Catholicos Kirakos (Cyriacus) between 1441 and 1443. At that time Etchmiadzin was {{under the control of the}} Turkic Kara Koyunlu, but in 1502, Safavid Iran gained control of parts of Armenia, including Etchmiadzin, and granted the Armenian Church some privileges.|$|E

Nevertheless, Licario proved {{one of the most}} successful military leaders in Michael VIII's employ, and his victories greatly <b>enhanced</b> <b>the</b> emperor's own standing and prestige amongst the Latins. The historian Deno John Geanakoplos ranks him, along with Michael's brother John Palaiologos, as the two men who caused the most damage to the Latin rulers of Greece.|$|E

40|$|Various {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} for image enhancement and restoration. The main difficulty is how to <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> structures uniformly while suppressing the noise without artifacts. In this paper, we tackle this problem in the gradient domain instead of the traditional intensity domain. By <b>enhancing</b> <b>the</b> gradient field, we can <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> structure uniformly without overshooting at the boundary. Because the gradient field is very sensitive to noise, we apply an orientationisotropy adaptive filter to the gradient field, suppressing the gradients in the noise regions while <b>enhancing</b> along <b>the</b> object boundaries. Thus we obtain a modulated gradient field, which is usually not integrable. We reconstruct <b>the</b> <b>enhanced</b> image from <b>the</b> modulated gradient field with least square errors by solving a Poisson equation. This method can <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> object contrast uniformly, suppress the noise with no artifacts, and avoid setting stopping time as in PDE methods. Experiments on noisy images show the efficacy of our method. 1...|$|R
