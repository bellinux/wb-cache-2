The Albanian ethnic minority is the more populous, having settled in Calabria between the 15 th and 17 th centuries, and these populations are now located in the provinces of Cosenza and Catanzaro. In the present study the Albanian population structure is analyzed based on the allele frequencies of six classic genetic markers: ACP, GC, PGM 1, AK, ADA, and 6 PGD. The results show a significant heterogeneity between the Albanian population in Calabria and the population in Molise.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Y-chromosome {{variation}} {{was analyzed}} {{in a sample}} of 1127 males from the Western Mediterranean area by surveying 16 biallelic and 4 multiallelic sites. Some populations from Northeastern Europe and the Middle East were also studied for comparison. All Y-chromosome haplotypes were included in a parsimonious genealogic tree consisting of 17 haplogroups, several of which displayed distinct geographic specificities. One of the haplogroups, HG 9. 2, has some features that are compatible with a spread into Europe from the Near East during the Neolithic period. However, the current distribution of this haplogroup would suggest that the Neolithic gene pool had a major impact in the eastern and central part of the Mediterranean basin, but very limited consequences in Iberia and Northwestern Europe. Two other haplogroups, HG 25. 2 and HG 2. 2, were found to have much more restricted geographic distributions. The first most likely originated in the Berbers within the last few thousand years, and allows the detection of gene flow to Iberia and Southern Europe. The latter haplogroup is common only in Sardinia, which confirms the <b>genetic</b> <b>peculiarity</b> and isolation of the Sardinians.

Data were collected during 2003 - 2004 from military registers in the Archive of the Military District of Cagliari for the years 1969 and 1998. A total of 22, 345 forms were analysed from all Sardinia. The conscripts were classified {{on the basis of}} their place of residence and socioeconomic status. The overall prevalence of overweight and obesity in Sardinia were 4. 33 % and 0. 55 %, respectively, for the conscripts of 1969 and 9. 8 % and 3 % for 1998. Olbia-Tempio (northern Sardinia) was the province with the highest incidence of overweight and obesity in 1969, and Nuoro (central Sardinia) had the highest incidence in 1998. Distribution of body mass index, overweight and obesity across the island showed a statistically significant heterogeneity that strongly decreased from 1969 to 1998.

40|$|Amphibians {{are facing}} a {{dramatic}} decline worldwide, due to their high susceptibility to perturbations and global change. A decrease in genetic diversity can lead to loss of adaptability, and it {{is often associated with}} reduction in fitness. Amphibians seem to be particularly prone to such genetic processes, and {{a growing body of research}} shows that many amphibian populations are experiencing a reduction in genetic variation. In this study we investigated the levels of genetic diversity and population differentiation of the common frog (Rana temporaria) in the alpine region of Trentino. Rana temporaria is a widespread amphibian species in Europe and is not currently considered threatened; nevertheless, in some part of its range it has recently experienced localized declines. We analyzed polymorphism in a set of 12 SSR loci, in about 25 populations spread over the entire area of interest. Levels of genetic diversity were comparable to those found in other European populations, but a relatively high degree of heterogeneity among sites was recorded. We detected an irregular population structure, though a first general subdivision may be recognized between the populations belonging to the orographic right and left side of the Adige river. Some populations of the central part of the area showed lower levels of genetic variability, together with relatively strong differentiation. This subarea is characterized by a wide and anthropized valley run through by the Adige river: the suitable habitat for Rana temporaria is limited to isolated patches within an inhospitable landscape matrix. In addition, this area largely overlaps with the distribution of Rana dalmatina in the Trentino region.

Multilocus sequence analysis of 82 A. actinomycetemcomitans strains, 66 of which were JP 2 clone strains collected {{over a period of}} more than 20 years, confirmed that there is a clonal population structure with evolutionary lineages corresponding to serotypes. Although genetically highly conserved, as shown by alignment of sequences of eight housekeeping genes, strains belonging to the JP 2 clone had a number of point mutations, particularly in the pseudogenes hbpA and tbpA. Characteristic mutations allowed isolates from individuals from the Mediterranean area and from West Africa, including the Cape Verde Islands, to be distinguished. The patterns of mutations indicate that the JP 2 clone initially emerged as a distinct genotype in the Mediterranean part of Africa approximately 2, 400 years ago and subsequently spread to West Africa, from which it was transferred to the American continents during the transatlantic slave trade. The sustained exclusive colonization of individuals of African descent despite geographical separation for centuries suggests that the JP 2 clone has a distinct host tropism.

This population shows morphological and <b>genetic</b> <b>peculiarities</b> and is threatened because of its very small distribution range, low numbers, reduced genetic variability and interspecific competition with allochtonous fallow deer Dama dama. In this paper an assessment is provided of red deer numbers and of relative densities of fallow deer, to evaluate the effects of conservation actions during the last 15 years (e. g. culling of fallow deer, supplementary feeding) {{on the status of}} the former. Between July and October 2010, 148 red deer were counted, with a balanced sex-ratio. Red deer productivity was low: the birth rate in 2010 was 0. 28 and the post-winter-recruitment in 2011 was 0. 21 calves/adult female. Apart from calves, yearlings were about 10 % of individuals, in both sexes. Red deer were concentrated in the small (ca. 100 ha) sector of the study area where supplementary feeding is provided. By contrast, fallow deer showed a greater productivity (0. 52 fawns/female) and a relatively more homogeneous distribution in the study area than the red deer. In the last decade, the Mesola red deer have more than doubled, suggesting the favourable effect of management measures on their conservation status. The gradual decline of both productivity and the annual finite rate of increase may indicate that the population is close to the carrying capacity of the Reserve. Present numbers would allow the use of 20 - 40 individuals to found at least 1 new population in a suitable area. The culling of fallow deer should go on to decrease the impact of this deer on natural food resources of red deer and to reduce the dependence of the latter from supplementary feeding...|$|R
40|$|Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is a Gram-negative periodontitis-associated {{bacterium}} that {{expresses a}} toxin that selectively affects leukocytes. This leukotoxin is encoded by an operon {{belonging to the}} core genome of this bacterial species. Variations in {{the expression of the}} leukotoxin have been reported, and a well-characterized specific clonal type (JP 2) of this bacterium with enhanced leukotoxin expression has been isolated. In particular, the presence of the JP 2 genotype significantly increases the risk for the progression of periodontal attachment loss (AL). Based on these findings we hypothesized that variations in the leukotoxicity are linked to disease progression in infected individuals. In the present study, the leukotoxicity of 239 clinical isolates of A. actinomycetemcomitans was analysed with different bioassays, and the <b>genetic</b> <b>peculiarities</b> of the isolates were related to their leukotoxicity based on examination with molecular techniques. The periodontal status of the individuals sampled for the presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans was examined longitudinally, and the importance of the observed variations in leukotoxicity was evaluated in relation to disease progression. Our data show that high leukotoxicity correlates with an enhanced risk for the progression of AL. The JP 2 genotype isolates were all highly leukotoxic, while the isolates with an intact leukotoxin promoter (non-JP 2 genotypes) showed substantial variation in leukotoxicity. Genetic characterization of the non-JP 2 genotype isolates indicated the presence of highly leukotoxic genotypes of serotype b with similarities to the JP 2 genotype. Based on these results, we conclude that A. actinomycetemcomitans harbours other highly virulent genotypes besides the previously described JP 2 genotype. In addition, the results from the present study further highlight the importance of the leukotoxin as a key virulence factor in aggressive forms of periodontitis.
