50|$|The Beckett skimmer {{has some}} {{similarities}} to the downdraft skimmer but introduced a <b>foam</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{to produce the}} flow of air bubbles. The name Beckett comes from the patented <b>foam</b> <b>nozzle</b> developed and sold by the Beckett Corporation (United States), although similar <b>foam</b> <b>nozzle</b> designs are sold by other companies outside the United States (e.g. Sicce (Italy)). Instead of using the plastic media that is found in downdraft skimmer designs, the Beckett skimmer uses design concepts from previous generations of skimmers, specifically the downdraft skimmer and the venturi skimmer (the Beckett 1408 <b>Foam</b> <b>Nozzle</b> is a modified 4 port venturi) to produce a hybrid {{that is capable of}} using powerful pressure rated water pumps and quickly processing large amounts of aquarium water {{in a short period of}} time. Commercial Beckett skimmers come in single Beckett, dual Beckett, and quad Beckett designs. Well engineered Beckett skimmers are quiet and reliable but the powerful pumps used in larger Beckett skimmer designs can take up additional space, introduce additional noise, and use more electricity than less powerful pumps. Unlike the Downdraft and Spray Induction skimmers, Beckett skimmer designs are produced by a number of companies in the United States and elsewhere and are not known to be restricted by patents.|$|E
40|$|NASA and the U. S. Coast Guard {{are working}} jointly {{to develop a}} {{helicopter}} transportable firefighting module that can shave precious minutes in combating shipboard or harbor fires. The program was undertaken in 1975, {{after a series of}} disastrous fires on oil tankers indicated a need for a lightweight, self-contained system that could be moved quickly to the scene of a fire. A prototype module was delivered to the Coast Guard last year and service testing is under way. The compact module weighs little more than a ton but it contains everything needed to fight a fire. The key component is a high output pump, which delivers up to 2, 000 gallons of sea water a minute; the pump can be brought up to maximum output in only one minute after turning on the power source, a small Allison gas turbine engine. The module also contains hose, a <b>foam</b> <b>nozzle</b> and a spray nozzle, three sets of protective clothing for firefighters, and fuel for three hours operation. Designed to be assembled without special tools, the module can be set up for operation in less than 20 minutes...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{compares the}} sealability performance of recently developed three synthetic foam formulations (that {{do not contain}} fluorosurfactants or fluoropolymers) with that of an {{aqueous film forming foam}} (AFFF). We apply the sealability methodology outlined in the Australian Defence Force Specification, DEF(AUST) 5706. This methodology specifies a 0. 28 m 2 small-scale indoor fire pan. The pan is first filled with 10 L of water and then 5 L of AVGAS (aviation gasoline, flash point of - 50 °C) or heptane (flash point of - 4 °C) is placed on top of the water. Foams were generated from a pressurised extinguisher with a <b>foam</b> <b>nozzle</b> as described in the standard's specification, set to create foams with expansion of 4 : 1. The foam spread across the fuel until the entire fuel surface was covered with foam. At 5 min intervals, a lit taper was introduced into the space above the pan area by passing it twice around the surface of the foam in a circular motion at a height of approximately 15 mm {{from the surface of the}} foam. The results demonstrate differences in the sealability performance between AFFF and fluorine-free foams (FfreeF). Under laboratory conditions, with a foam blanket 1 - 2 cm deep, best-performing FfreeF formulation (RF 6) provides about 30 % of the durability of an AFFF for protection against evaporation of low-flashpoint flammable liquids. We also note in the results the significant differences among FfreeF with almost no sealability of AVGAS vapours offered by the two other formulations...|$|E

50|$|An Australian Water Tender {{can range}} from a {{standard}} fire engine, with a larger-than-usual capacity (usually called a tanker), to a Water Tender equipped with specialty equipment such as fixed monitors and long-throw <b>foam</b> <b>nozzles</b> (usually called a Bulk Water Carrier). Several areas also own converted semi-trailer fuel tankers, capable of holding many thousands of litres of petrol, foam or other retardant. These are most often used in severe HazMat situations, such as oil refinery fires or fuel tanker accidents, where a large and continuous volume of water is needed.|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the South African Transport Conference 17 - 20 July 2000 "Action in transport for the new millennium", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT: The use of foamed bitumen for the modification and improvement of roadbuilding materials is increasing globally. This is mainly due to the increased commercial availability of static and mobile plants with the capacity to produce foamed bitumen following the lapse in patents on the <b>foam</b> <b>nozzle</b> system. As new rehabilitation procedures for maintenance and upgrading of the South African road network such as “In place cold recycling with foamed bitumen” emerge, so a level suitable level of understanding of these processes and reliability in the products requires development. The primary objective of the research was to further the understanding of foamed bitumen treatment. This {{was carried out by}} characterising the foamed materials with the same tests as the equivalent emulsion treated materials, which is a better-understood product. In addition to the standard tests, triaxial testing was also carried out on the foamed mix only, as part of a research investigation. Acelerated Pavement Testing (APT) was performed as part of the rutting potential investigation during early strength conditions. It also provided insight into ravelling of foamed bitumen and emulsion treated layers under traffic. The influence of slushing with water or diluted emulsion were investigated and reported. The comparisons between foamed bitumen and bitumen emulsion treated mixes have highlighted the differences between these mixes. Foamed bitumen has provided higher tensile strengths than the equivalent emulsion mix, but higher field compaction results and consequently better rut resistance was achieved for the emulsion treated materials, probably due to a more favourable moisture regime during compaction. The influence of the cement content was not investigated. This paper was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference.

40|$|Three nozzle types were {{compared}} {{in a trial}} investigating the potential for herbicide drift during aerial spraying. Water containing a colorimetric tracer, a fluorimetric tracer, and a foaming agent was sprayed from a helicopter boom along a single flight line. Deposition on steel plates located on the ground was measured to a distance of 300 m downwind. The airborne flux was measured to 225 m downwind, using "Rotorod" samplers. Conventional D 8 - 45 nozzles {{were found to have}} greater drift potential than <b>foaming</b> <b>nozzles</b> (both pointing straight down). Lowest airborne drift occurred during use of D 8 nozzles, pointing straight back. Deposition measurements using steel plates on the ground showed that peak deposition was greatest and closest to the flight line with D 8 <b>nozzles,</b> followed by <b>foaming</b> and D 8 - 45 nozzles. Steel plates on the ground were found to be unsuitable for estimation of airborne flux...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{granular}} materials {{suitable for}} building all-weather roads are not uniformly {{distributed throughout the}} state of Iowa. For this reason the Iowa Highway Research Board has sponsored a number of research programs {{for the purpose of}} developing new and effective methods for making use of whatever materials are locally available. This need is ever more pressing today due to the decreasing availability of road funds and quality materials, and the increasing costs of energy and all types of binder materials. In the 1950 s, Professor L. H. Csanyi of Iowa State University had demonstrated both in the laboratory and in the field, in Iowa and in a number of foreign countries, the effectiveness of preparing low cost mixes by stabilizing ungraded local aggregates such as gravel, sand and loess with asphalt cements using the foamed asphalt process. In this process controlled foam was produced by introducing saturated steam at about 40 psi into heated asphalt cement at about 25 psi through a specially designed and properly adjusted nozzle. The reduced viscosity and the increased volume and surface energy in the foamed asphalt allowed intimate coating and mixing of cold, wet aggregates or soils. Through the use of asphalt cements in a foamed state, materials normally considered unsuitable could be used in the preparation of mixes for stabilized bases and surfaces for low traffic road construction. By attaching the desired number of <b>foam</b> <b>nozzles,</b> the <b>foamed</b> asphalt can be used in conjunction with any type of mixing plant, either stationary or mobile, batch or continuous, central plant or in-place soil stabilization...|$|R

40|$|The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code, Fluent, is {{employed}} {{to simulate the}} flow phenomena inside the annular foam breaker {{in order to improve}} its performance. The numerical simulation results show that the value and the distribution of the negative pressure are very important for the annular foam breaker. The design of the Laval nozzle not only can increase the fluid velocity, but also can reduce the pressure value from - 30. 2 to - 50. 3 kPa compared with the common annular <b>nozzle</b> <b>foam</b> breaker. In order to improve the range of the internal negative pressure, the two-stage Laval annular foam breaker is designed in this study. The analysis results show the distance between the two annular slit have greatly influence on its performance. There is a small overlap area between the two negative pressure zones generated by the two annular slits. The smaller the value distance is, the larger the overlap zone is. When the value of the distance decreases to 50 mm, the minimum negative pressure can be reduced to approximately - 65. 5 kPa. Meanwhile, the range of the internal negative pressure is larger than the single Laval annular foam breaker, which is benefit to break foam...|$|R
